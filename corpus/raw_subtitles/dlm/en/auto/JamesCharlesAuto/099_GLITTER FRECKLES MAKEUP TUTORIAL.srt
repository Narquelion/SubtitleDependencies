00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
hi sisters James Charles here and

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:04,440
welcome back to my youtube channel

3
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,879
cutting right to the point for today's

4
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,010
video I wanted to sit down and just do

5
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:09,420
some type of glam look I feel like for

6
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,160
the past several several videos I've

7
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,960
been wearing a super super light glam I

8
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,280
mean it has honestly been a week since I

9
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,450
put on eye shadow which is absolutely

10
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,000
horrifying considering my job is

11
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:20,220
literally a makeup artist I put together

12
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,570
this winged out bronzy half cut crease I

13
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,699
look that I absolutely am in love with

14
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,199
and then I added these gold little star

15
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:26,430
freckles which you will see later on in

16
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,590
the video which is such a cute little

17
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,910
touch that I am so in love with and then

18
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,650
I just paired it with this nude lip and

19
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,300
this is the look that I came up with I'm

20
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,750
getting like very very summery festival

21
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,190
vibes

22
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,090
I know summer is like basically over

23
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,190
with and that means back-to-school

24
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,629
season is coming whoo check out last

25
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,309
week's video after needed tutorial on it

26
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:43,230
but I figured I would do this little

27
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:45,210
festival kind of inspired look just to

28
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,320
bring us back to the good old days all

29
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,700
that being said if you guys would like

30
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:54,390
to see how I created this look make sure

31
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:55,680
you keep on watching so to start off I

32
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,120
already went ahead and I primed my face

33
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,500
using my moisturizer and then I'm gonna

34
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,230
go in with my Make Up For Ever Ultra HD

35
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,210
stick in the shade of y 365 for a base

36
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,710
it's actually been so long since I've

37
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,630
done a full coverage glam I feel like

38
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:08,490
I've only been doing a light building

39
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:10,110
natural glam for a very long time now so

40
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,360
I'm super excited to actually be doing a

41
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:14,400
real look today and this is gonna be a

42
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,570
super super fun one as well I'm also

43
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,740
gonna grab a little bit of Too Faced

44
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:18,600
spores and Sohee foundation in the shade

45
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,680
and natural beige and just put a little

46
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,810
bit on the back of my hand and I'm going

47
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,070
to dip into my Beauty Blender and kind

48
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:24,930
of use this foundation to blend out the

49
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:26,310
make up front row Ultra HD stick these

50
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:27,659
are both my favorite foundations for

51
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,180
very different reasons so I'm gonna get

52
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:31,560
the best of both worlds today oh my god

53
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,180
I can't believe actually never tried

54
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,170
mixing these two foundations together I

55
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,520
guess I've never really thought about it

56
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,630
because the makeup everyone is a stick

57
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,509
and then the two based one is a liquid

58
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:42,960
but my skin looks so good right now oh

59
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:44,460
my god chicken seal today I'm gonna grab

60
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,869
my ATAR shape tube concealer in the

61
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:49,070
shade light/medium honey and just

62
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:49,070
highlight the high points of my face

63
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:55,009
I don't know if it's all that studio

64
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:56,210
light that we added but I think if my

65
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:58,250
eyes are not deceiving me that we were

66
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:00,860
having a super super good skin day today

67
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:02,869
which makes me so happy thank you for

68
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,770
once in my life to lock our face in

69
00:02:02,869 --> 00:02:05,360
place that are gonna be using of course

70
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:07,369
the laura mercier translucent setting

71
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,380
powder during the summer time I really

72
00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:11,000
like only setting up my nose area and

73
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:12,650
then under my eyes because those are the

74
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,140
two areas that definitely wear out the

75
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:16,250
fastest and get the most creases so I

76
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,540
really just like setting hair to lock

77
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,989
the face but then as for the rest my

78
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,670
face

79
00:02:17,989 --> 00:02:21,560
I literally just add the lightest layer

80
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:23,930
a powder possible if even powdering at

81
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,090
all because I really like the summer and

82
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:27,739
dewy foundation look as you guys know I

83
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:29,750
feel like it just looks so beautiful and

84
00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:31,459
so natural and I am going to a party

85
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,500
slash event tonight that I'm literally

86
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:35,510
so excited for it is the desi and Katy

87
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:37,040
dose of colors launched I am so proud of

88
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:38,630
them and so skater to try the products

89
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,280
but I definitely need this foundation

90
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:41,569
and makeup look to last a very very long

91
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,330
time because it is early in the morning

92
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:46,280
today and I have to wear this at like 7

93
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,360
p.m. tonight so definitely want to keep

94
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,220
this in place

95
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,989
I don't think want this look to be super

96
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:52,640
super golden and bronzy today so of

97
00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:54,140
course we have to pack on the bronzer

98
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,420
and for this I'm gonna use my benefit

99
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,980
hoola bronzer as always as I Murphy M

100
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:00,049
for a fire brush and you guys know you

101
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:01,910
can use code J's for 10% off all morphe

102
00:03:00,049 --> 00:03:03,709
brushes since I didn't pack on the

103
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:05,120
setting powder today I'm being very very

104
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:07,100
light when I'm applying this bronzer

105
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,630
because if I dig it into my face too

106
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:10,220
hard it's definitely gonna lead the

107
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:11,570
powder looking super super patchy and I

108
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,790
definitely want it to cling on to the

109
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:15,109
still kind of wet foundation so I'm just

110
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:16,250
being super super light and letting that

111
00:03:15,109 --> 00:03:17,690
color get on there naturally

112
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,370
alright so listen to you guys I

113
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:21,829
literally just did exactly what I said

114
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:23,090
not to do and I was bronzing to hard

115
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:24,890
enough you can see right here on camera

116
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:26,390
my foundation is coming up a little bit

117
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:27,470
and starting to separate so I'm just

118
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,609
gonna lightly go over that with some

119
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:30,109
more studying powder just make sure that

120
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:31,880
area is really really locked in place

121
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:33,709
because I don't my foundation to wear oh

122
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:37,220
next thing to grab my Kat Von D shade in

123
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:38,750
late huh and my Anasazi a 22 brush and

124
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,920
we dip into this light yellow shade

125
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,150
right up in here I just used that a

126
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,280
little bit to reinforce the highlights

127
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:44,299
on my face it's good to reinforce those

128
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,859
highlights that we originally put on

129
00:03:44,299 --> 00:03:47,420
with the concealer just because after

130
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:49,010
bronzer and contour that brightness can

131
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,030
sometimes get lost amongst the blending

132
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:52,220
and everything so it's always good to

133
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:54,230
reinforce and make sure we are snatched

134
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:56,120
and fully chiseled I'm going to grab my

135
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:57,920
Luxy 180 nose contouring brush and dip

136
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,330
into it the middle shade and the left

137
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,020
shade of the shade of my palette and

138
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:07,700
then lightly

139
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:09,020
my nose I'm gonna grab a little bit more

140
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,370
Laura Mercier powder and just lightly

141
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:14,620
baked besides my nose just to make sure

142
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:14,620
it's really really locked in a place I

143
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:23,870
guess might as well go really full-time

144
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:28,180
bake the rest night phase to it has

145
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:28,180
definitely been a hot minute why not I

146
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,590
just went ahead and did my eyebrows

147
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,090
off-camera you guys to be doing them

148
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:36,620
literally a million times so I figured

149
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:38,870
might as well just skip out on it today

150
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:40,070
as well I kind of want to cry right now

151
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:42,260
because I literally just hid my entire

152
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:43,790
eye on camera and explained everything

153
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:46,070
only just realized I wasn't actually

154
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:47,390
recording so normally my videos don't go

155
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:49,040
in this order normally I do one on

156
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:50,240
camera then off I guess what is already

157
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,000
done so now we're gonna do the other one

158
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,830
on camera again but this time we better

159
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,420
be recording I'm gonna start off with my

160
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,920
um 4-3-3 brush and dipping into the

161
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:59,750
joseline help palette I'm gonna grab

162
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,890
this kind of mac and cheese type shade

163
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,810
and it's gonna put that all up in the

164
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:04,310
crease I'm literally so annoyed right

165
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:05,330
now because doing eye looks on camera

166
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:07,100
and having to explain everything

167
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:08,690
literally takes me forever but I can

168
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:10,640
literally recreate the same eye look off

169
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:12,710
camera and like ten minutes no matter

170
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,270
what I look it is so I know I'm gonna be

171
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:16,820
late to my event now and this is not

172
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:18,470
what I wanted to happen I'm not swearing

173
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,760
another M 4 3 3 brush and I'm gonna dip

174
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:21,170
into this orange shade right up in here

175
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:25,400
and put that in the crease once again to

176
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:27,170
deepen it up when I get to this outer

177
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,970
corner I'm going to wing out the shadow

178
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:31,120
quite a bit because we want that like

179
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:33,290
blended out festival type makeup look

180
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,060
next I'm going to dip into this warm Tom

181
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:36,410
Brown shape it up in here and start to

182
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,890
deepen out the outer corner and blend

183
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:41,330
that up a little bit into the crease

184
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:44,020
then with my m56 - I'm just gonna blend

185
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:44,020
out those edges

186
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:50,029
using my M 509 brush I'm just gonna grab

187
00:05:48,289 --> 00:05:51,619
the slightest bit of the black shape on

188
00:05:50,029 --> 00:05:53,989
the bottom corner and just eeping out

189
00:05:51,619 --> 00:05:55,519
the very very very outer V I'm gonna be

190
00:05:53,989 --> 00:05:57,289
super super careful with this color

191
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:58,939
because adding too much block can really

192
00:05:57,289 --> 00:06:01,189
ruin this look very very very quickly

193
00:05:58,939 --> 00:06:02,929
and this black in this palette is super

194
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:04,279
super pigmented as well so I'm just

195
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:08,419
going to add a light amount and then

196
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:10,069
blend it out like I said I'm being super

197
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:11,899
super careful and letting this out I

198
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:13,789
definitely am NOT going for a block

199
00:06:11,899 --> 00:06:15,860
smokey eye look today maybe that's next

200
00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:17,899
video but for now I just want to deepen

201
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:19,849
up that outer corner so adding block is

202
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:23,389
really really risky but can definitely

203
00:06:19,849 --> 00:06:24,889
look great if you do it right I'm gonna

204
00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:26,240
add some little on top of the lid but at

205
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:28,849
the base I'm gonna go to the my morphe

206
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,229
35o palette and my makeup shock t6 brush

207
00:06:28,849 --> 00:06:31,879
and I'm gonna dip into this orange shade

208
00:06:30,229 --> 00:06:33,139
in the bottom right corner and just use

209
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:36,139
this to carve out the crease

210
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:41,719
oh the shadow is literally so pretty oh

211
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:43,309
my god one slash taught us on there I'm

212
00:06:41,719 --> 00:06:44,509
just gonna grab a clean a blending brush

213
00:06:43,309 --> 00:06:45,379
and go right over those edges to make

214
00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:48,079
sure everything is really really

215
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:49,759
diffused and blended out except for the

216
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:51,379
crease obviously but that's kind of the

217
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,789
whole point to add a little bit of

218
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:54,289
glitter and more pop to this eye look

219
00:06:52,789 --> 00:06:57,709
I'm gonna grab these steal at liquid

220
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:59,719
glitters stuff and rose gold retro you

221
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:01,459
guys know these are so bomb I'm gonna

222
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:04,009
lightly Pat this over top of that shadow

223
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:06,740
oh yeah wow that is over looking for

224
00:07:04,009 --> 00:07:08,449
that looks so pretty for the lower lash

225
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,889
that I'm gonna go in with my M 4-3-3 and

226
00:07:08,449 --> 00:07:11,569
dip into that burnt orange shade at once

227
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:13,279
again and just put a little bit of it

228
00:07:11,569 --> 00:07:16,279
down right after I destroy this glitter

229
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:17,689
fallout oh my I'm definitely gonna hug

230
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:19,189
the shadow very very close to the lash

231
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:20,479
line when I get to this outer corner I'm

232
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:21,860
also gonna blend it up into this dark

233
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,300
out our wing portion it being a very

234
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,339
very careful to not really take it on

235
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,360
into this area just think I kind of just

236
00:07:25,339 --> 00:07:27,649
did because that's when things start

237
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,449
getting really really muddy like right

238
00:07:27,649 --> 00:07:31,699
here but no worries we're gonna fix it

239
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:33,289
next intagram I am 509 brush and dip

240
00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:35,300
into the soft brown shade right here and

241
00:07:33,289 --> 00:07:37,999
define at the very very upper lash line

242
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,199
lower lash line then if I am 149 and a

243
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,550
little bit of burnt orange and just come

244
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,050
up on that out because once again we

245
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,939
definitely don't want a black smoky eye

246
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:45,199
one check that I love to do is driving

247
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:46,909
my Beauty Blender and a little bit more

248
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,529
of that translucent powder that I use it

249
00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:49,610
doesn't matter which one and I'm just

250
00:07:48,529 --> 00:07:51,199
going to put a little bit of powder

251
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:52,999
right underneath that shadow to kind of

252
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,589
bake it and lighten it back up to skin

253
00:07:52,999 --> 00:07:56,269
tone and this will actually really do a

254
00:07:54,589 --> 00:07:57,829
good job of cleaning everything up and

255
00:07:56,269 --> 00:07:59,790
then finally I'm gonna grab my NYX

256
00:07:57,829 --> 00:08:01,890
wonder pencil in the lightest shade and

257
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:03,900
use this to a line at my waterline

258
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:05,310
census look at super super intense and

259
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,390
dark on those outer corners I definitely

260
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:08,340
wanna use a lighter color in the

261
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:10,080
waterline to open my eyes back up we're

262
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:13,920
all still gonna look super super small

263
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:15,420
and tiny for mascara today I'm gonna do

264
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,180
a light coat of benefit roller lash two

265
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:19,350
bears no this is my all-time favorite

266
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:21,570
lashes so got a pop of my house lashes

267
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:22,980
iconic light it has been so long since

268
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:24,630
I've used these lashes and I'm honestly

269
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:26,730
so excited I'm getting like so much

270
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:28,290
nostalgia I think everything using Lily

271
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:30,000
lashes miami's for the past like sixty

272
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:32,780
four years straight so it's time for a

273
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,780
little bit of a sweat job

274
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,959
for that classic golden glow of course

275
00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:42,819
you guys know we're gonna be using the

276
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,439
Anasazi Oh sell Hollywood illuminator I

277
00:08:42,819 --> 00:08:46,389
use this all the time like literally in

278
00:08:44,439 --> 00:08:48,009
every single video but it truly is so

279
00:08:46,389 --> 00:08:49,600
good and it works really perfectly for

280
00:08:48,009 --> 00:08:51,069
my skin tone as well I find that

281
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,170
oftentimes a lot of highlighters can

282
00:08:51,069 --> 00:08:55,779
leave a gray cast on my skin because I

283
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:57,189
do have a pretty light skin or it'll

284
00:08:55,779 --> 00:08:58,329
just look really walking in general so

285
00:08:57,189 --> 00:09:02,740
definitely would recommend it so

286
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:05,110
Hollywood of course gonna put this on my

287
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:07,360
brow bone as well you guys know the

288
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:13,480
drill by now I'm also gonna highlight my

289
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:14,860
nose easy way I'm a 4:3 one brush all

290
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,999
right so that is the glow all complete

291
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,269
and before we actually move on to the

292
00:09:15,999 --> 00:09:17,860
lips

293
00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:19,329
I do introducing a little bit fun for

294
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,709
this look if you guys follow me on

295
00:09:19,329 --> 00:09:21,970
snapchat you know that this whole are

296
00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:26,800
you doing my setup process has been

297
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:28,360
quite the process yes a few weeks ago

298
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,220
mr. Kay came over and actually helped me

299
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,230
rearrange its entire Beauty room and now

300
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:33,579
I've actually rearranged again but

301
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:35,350
regardless they've always been one of my

302
00:09:33,579 --> 00:09:37,420
favorite channels I love their videos so

303
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:39,040
freakin much and they have been a major

304
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:40,600
source of inspiration for all my

305
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,100
apartment decorating stuff and when

306
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,170
Caine was over she did give me her

307
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,549
little mr. Kay a beauty mark stickers

308
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:47,199
and I didn't test these out earlier on

309
00:09:45,549 --> 00:09:49,269
but I'm gonna be putting these like

310
00:09:47,199 --> 00:09:51,040
little gold stars up in here on my Halle

311
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:52,029
area because why not

312
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,799
I'm just gonna take my little pair of

313
00:09:52,029 --> 00:09:57,339
eyelash tweezers and I'm going to cut

314
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:59,110
out my stars I just remove the plastic

315
00:09:57,339 --> 00:10:01,059
throw from the top as well and then I'm

316
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:02,170
just going to place it on my skin where

317
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:05,860
I want it and I think we're gonna put

318
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:07,240
this right over here on my highlight

319
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:09,939
region and then I'm just gonna hold it

320
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:12,220
in place and I have a damp towel here

321
00:10:09,939 --> 00:10:15,639
and I'm just going to press this right

322
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:17,259
into the skin I tested this out earlier

323
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:18,519
as well before I actually did this whole

324
00:10:17,259 --> 00:10:20,439
look to make sure that this one mess up

325
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:23,410
my entire face the foundation and it did

326
00:10:20,439 --> 00:10:25,029
not it looked super super great so I am

327
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:26,230
not worried I am just being really

328
00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:27,699
really careful because obviously we

329
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:29,379
don't want our entire face to get wet

330
00:10:27,699 --> 00:10:30,879
just the part that has the little

331
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:32,379
sticker on it as we learned in my video

332
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:34,269
from a few weeks ago most makeup is

333
00:10:32,379 --> 00:10:35,949
definitely waterproof this is literally

334
00:10:34,269 --> 00:10:37,540
exactly like all the temporary tattoos

335
00:10:35,949 --> 00:10:38,999
that we all did we were like 8 years old

336
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:40,990
but just a whole lot prettier

337
00:10:38,999 --> 00:10:42,100
alright and once it's been on for 30

338
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:48,730
seconds I'm just going to give it a good

339
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:50,400
little pat and then oh yes I love all

340
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:52,080
these gold records without they're loose

341
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,850

00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,590

from now on all products that I use in

347
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:03,510
all my tutorials will be listed in the

348
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:04,860
description so if you see something that

very very bold so for the lips today I

353
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,750
definitely wanna keep a light nude so

354
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:14,310
I'm first gonna start off by lighting my

355
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:19,620
lips using the Mac lip pencil in the

356
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:20,940
shade whirl alright and last but finally

357

not least I'm gonna set my face in place

358
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:25,490
using my morphe crepin set setting spray

359
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:32,070
all right scissors and that is this a

360
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:33,090
bronzy gold festival style makeup look I

361
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:35,010
don't know what the hell to call this

362
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:36,150
