already have my full base on of course

68
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,520
this is gonna be a mostly eye shadow

69
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,229

70
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,930
everybody else who entered but let's get

71
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:08,540
started

72
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:10,460
I went ahead and do two guys in a little

73
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:12,020
bit welcome to my base all I know I get

74
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:13,700
a lot of complaints a lot when I do do

75
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:16,030
makeup and videos that you guys can't

76
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:18,260
actually see what I'm doing

77
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:20,240
sorry about that as usual I'm gonna

78
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,560
focus on one eye intensely on camera

79
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,240
here just because we kind of have a lot

80
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,890
going on and I don't want to sit here

81
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,540
for eight hours and neither do you so

82
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:28,820
that's the tea on that I think we're

83
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:31,010
gonna start off with just a little brush

84
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:33,950
this is the my 14 years coating for 10%

85
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:35,510
off and dip all four more feet you guys

86
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:45,650
already knew that and dip into kind of a

87
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:46,580
yellow shade and pop that yeah just

88
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:48,110
gonna pop that right here on the inner

89
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,220
corner I'm not really sure the order in

90
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,330
which I'm gonna kind of do this look

91
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,890
today I think we're just gonna really

92
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:53,390
throw on some colors and hope and pray

93
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,950
that it looks good that's kinda what I

94
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:57,950
do in all my makeup tutorials and it

95
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:59,780
usually or so kind of so that's what

96
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:00,020
we're doing great it's henna cool

97
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,790
because

98
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:03,590
Enrico's drawing here all the colors are

99
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:04,940
placed really really close together but

100
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:07,130
are still very wounded out which is

101
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:09,200
extremely hard to do so props to him I'm

102
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:12,380
gonna take a kind of bright peachy ready

103
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:16,760
orange shade with an M 506 and place

104
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:18,080
that right in the crease return that

105
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,670
color shift between the yellow and red

106
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,160
and then the purple and blue kind of

107
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:23,890
happens like here-ish so I think I'm

108
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,600
just gonna pack a little bit more on

109
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:28,400
[Music]

110
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,590
maybe that looks not good oh my god it's

111
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,540
so hard to blend yellow oh please go on

112
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:37,700
there that might be a facetune moment

113
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:39,950
now I'm gonna take an am up to 13 and a

114
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:41,840
dark red shade and use this to really

115
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:46,299
cut out where I'm gonna place that

116
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:52,760
crease which is gonna be right here

117
00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:53,570
hopefully that looks so busted a hole oh

118
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,500
my god

119
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:56,570
it's just gonna work it's gonna work

120
00:03:54,500 --> 00:04:00,110
right now okay great next I'm gonna take

121
00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:02,180
a curve ball shade on an M 514 once

122
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:04,400
again and I'm gonna place that next door

123
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,880
to that like burgundy area kind of right

124
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,530
up in here

125
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:12,090
oh that's pretty T and then before I

126
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:14,070
actually go and blend that further I'm

127
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:16,440
going to grab that dark red shade once

128
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:20,390
again and use that to kind of easily

129
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,390
transition the purple into oh

130
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:25,710
James Charles forgetting how to do

131
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:27,690
makeup for five minutes Trey I'm scared

132
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:30,240
mostly the purple it goes down and

133
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:33,570
really cuts out the crease moment and

134
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,740
then we have some blue that is there too

135
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:36,690
I'm gonna grab that same purple on a

136
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:38,670
kind of liner I think this is a lip

137
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:40,410
brush I have no idea and put that in the

138
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:42,150
crease once again just like we did with

139
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:44,490
this front part kind of lining where I

140
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:48,810
want the colors to go or at least like

141
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:50,190
where I think they're gonna go there's

142
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:54,120
lots of purple and up here so I'm just

143
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:55,380
gonna put that there yeah we're gonna

144
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,640
regret that later I'm gonna blend these

145
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,950
two together so it doesn't look like

146
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,330
gross and it's watching I'm gonna kind

147
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:02,790
of fun okay cool

148
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:04,410
now I'm gonna grab a medium tone of blue

149
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:06,030
shade and this I want to use kind of

150
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:08,040
like a Hawking brush since I really want

151
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:13,440
this blue shade to be kind of a quite

152
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:16,760
pigmented so I'm going to grab that and

153
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,760
place that right there

154
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:21,900
oh well that blue is so pretty

155
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:29,330
T

156
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:33,300
[Music]

157
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:36,599
that looks bad

158
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:39,089
who's GERD okay then I'm just gonna go

159
00:05:36,599 --> 00:05:41,639
out like a lighter blue and place that

160
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:43,559
right over that to blend that ow and I'm

161
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:47,550
gonna be putting a blue highlight in the

162
00:05:43,559 --> 00:05:51,809
brow oh my god this looks disgusting on

163
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:53,519
camera what's happening then it's going

164
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:55,619
to go the anasazi up moonchild palette

165
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,300
this literally it used to be my favorite

166
00:05:55,619 --> 00:06:00,239
highlighting palette of all time this is

167
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:01,559
like one of the og makeup lover moments

168
00:06:00,239 --> 00:06:03,749
like when this released though nation

169
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:05,849
was shaking including me and as you can

170
00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:07,829
tell this is bana clearly quite used so

171
00:06:05,849 --> 00:06:10,529
under got the shade star and I'm gonna

172
00:06:07,829 --> 00:06:12,389
place this right on lieth brow bone to

173
00:06:10,529 --> 00:06:13,800
hopefully pick some of this horrible

174
00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:19,739
blending that I have going on I don't

175
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:21,929
know what I'm doing what is that that is

176
00:06:19,739 --> 00:06:24,329
it doesn't even look oh okay I guess

177
00:06:21,929 --> 00:06:29,879
that's okay it's really pretty if you

178
00:06:24,329 --> 00:06:32,479
look at it like from this angle I'm like

179
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:32,479
only that angle

180
00:06:34,969 --> 00:06:40,799
okay this looks absolutely the absolute

181
00:06:39,239 --> 00:06:42,629
worst but you know what maybe when we

182
00:06:40,799 --> 00:06:43,860
cut it in a look a little bit better I'm

183
00:06:42,629 --> 00:06:45,779
gonna grab a shape tape in the shade

184
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,099
fair I was like to cut my crease no

185
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:48,599
matter what look it's using a really

186
00:06:47,099 --> 00:06:50,039
light concealer just to kind of act as

187
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:51,209
like an eyeshadow base and my favorite

188
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:52,379
brush to cut the crease is going to be

189
00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:55,400
the Mac 242

190
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:59,980
no discount code but it's still good oh

191
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,980
[Music]

192
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:09,589
my god wait this looks actually pretty

193
00:07:02,159 --> 00:07:11,909
now that it's getting kind o T cool if

194
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:13,469
you guys went sister subscribers for a

195
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:14,849
long time you would know that this is

196
00:07:13,469 --> 00:07:17,219
actually not the way that I used to do

197
00:07:14,849 --> 00:07:19,439
cut creases I used to draw out the

198
00:07:17,219 --> 00:07:20,759
bottom line first and then blend the

199
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,529
shadows upwards which was definitely a

200
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:24,059
more complicated process but for some

201
00:07:22,529 --> 00:07:25,259
reason I had never best up when it came

202
00:07:24,059 --> 00:07:27,149
to actually drawing the shape now that I

203
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:29,129
switch over to the dark side and do this

204
00:07:27,149 --> 00:07:30,599
technique of drawing creases can never

205
00:07:29,129 --> 00:07:32,339
get them even should it is stuck to I

206
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:33,809
got it you all lied now that the creases

207
00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:35,639
all caught I'm just gonna take a flat

208
00:07:33,809 --> 00:07:36,659
top little brush and just pack on some

209
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:38,369
of my face powder

210
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:40,019
really carefully obviously not to mess

211
00:07:38,369 --> 00:07:42,089
the shape up but I want to set this in

212
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:45,569
place once again it before I put on any

213
00:07:42,089 --> 00:07:48,119
eyeshadow and also just because that's

214
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:49,919
what you do oh this is looking good now

215
00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:51,689
okay now I'm kind of happy I excited a

216
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,919
little bit low key okay let me stay

217
00:07:51,689 --> 00:07:55,409
humble for a second before this gets

218
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:59,489
ugly again okay so it looks like there

219
00:07:55,409 --> 00:08:06,179
is her weight yeah I don't think there's

220
00:07:59,489 --> 00:08:08,039
purple on the lid I think I wonder what

221
00:08:06,179 --> 00:08:09,329
they want me to do while I decide what's

222
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:13,309
gonna go on the lid I'm gonna go ahead

223
00:08:09,329 --> 00:08:13,309
and line this with white

224
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:21,250
now that we have the crease all cut we

225
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:22,810
have the lid to do and I'm honestly

226
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:25,480
having a little bit of trouble telling

227
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:27,760
what's on the lid it looks like there's

228
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:30,640
kind of like a purple moment with a like

229
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:32,979
sparkly moment in the middle which I'm

230
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:35,680
definitely down for so I think I'm just

231
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:37,150
gonna kind of line this with purple and

232
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,530
two hour goes I'm just gonna use an

233
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,849
angle brush to do this just because I do

234
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:41,349
want to be a little bit precise I'm

235
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:43,510
gonna be really careful and just tuck

236
00:08:41,349 --> 00:08:45,040
that purple right up against that white

237
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:46,870
line I do have a feeling that I'm gonna

238
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,640
have to go back in once I finish the

239
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:50,890
purple portion and realign it which is

240
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,090
fine but obviously no ideal because

241
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:53,890
that's like a lot of work that I don't

242
00:08:52,090 --> 00:09:00,610
really want to do this winged portion is

243
00:08:53,890 --> 00:09:02,080
gonna go like here since I haven't had

244
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:03,700
as much time to really sit down and do a

245
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,950
lot of this creative looks anymore which

246
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:07,510
hurts my soul every single day I think

247
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:09,040
every time I do actually try to do that

248
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:10,510
I think I'm literally changing my plan

249
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,100
in freaking out every single look

250
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:13,210
because halfway through all hate it and

251
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,460
then five minutes later I'll be in love

252
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:17,430
with it and then every step just keeps

253
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:20,290
changing like that does not look good

254
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:21,610
we're fresh gonna put some purple right

255
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:23,200
here and then I guess I'm gonna put

256
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:26,470
glitter on the lid I don't know what

257
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,240
color I want to do yet but we're gonna

258
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,320
make that decision together probably

259
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,590
take a light blue I should probably just

260
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:35,250
I'm right literally right back into blue

261
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:35,250
like this blue

262
00:09:36,529 --> 00:09:41,429
and I'm gonna pull it all the way into

263
00:09:38,699 --> 00:09:43,840
the inner corner because there will be a

264
00:09:41,429 --> 00:09:50,540
pop of white there eventually

265
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:53,069
[Music]

266
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:54,810
that's like good enough whatever I'm

267
00:09:53,069 --> 00:09:56,579
gonna play some reflect steal from Mac

268
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:58,410
right on the center of that lid to

269
00:09:56,579 --> 00:10:00,209
really make that blue pop us a little

270
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:05,990
bit and create the effect of the halo I

271
00:10:00,209 --> 00:10:05,990
oh yeah that's pretty

272
00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:16,819
I was probably about idea what am i

273
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,819
doing

274
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:26,459
finally that looks like okay now that we

275
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:28,170
have all the liner done kind of I'm

276
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:32,699
gonna start sketching out death because

277
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:34,319
this is getting really hard then it's

278
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:36,060
gonna pack on some purple right over

279
00:10:34,319 --> 00:10:39,200
here and blend that out for a real one

280
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:39,200
[Music]

281
00:10:40,269 --> 00:10:45,009
kind of happy with that okay I'm gonna

282
00:10:42,999 --> 00:10:46,899
take that bright burnt red shade from

283
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:48,910
before and place that right next order

284
00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:51,100
this Powerball below the liner and kind

285
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:54,630
of blend those two together and pull the

286
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:57,029
shade right off into the lower lash line

287
00:10:54,630 --> 00:11:00,699
[Music]

288
00:10:57,029 --> 00:11:02,470
great looks actually good for once just

289
00:11:00,699 --> 00:11:04,269
gonna use a few different m-43 threes

290
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:05,319
with some different oranges and reds on

291
00:11:04,269 --> 00:11:07,629
them to really make sure everything is

292
00:11:05,319 --> 00:11:08,889
kind of blended together I'm gonna take

293
00:11:07,629 --> 00:11:10,660
the atom up five to one it's kind of

294
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:13,119
like a bigger pocket - and I'm gonna

295
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:14,740
place this like orange shade kind of

296
00:11:13,119 --> 00:11:16,749
like right here and actually tuck this

297
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:19,420
orange right into the highlight and into

298
00:11:16,749 --> 00:11:21,249
the blushed region as well because on

299
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:24,279
this photo this blush is like gorgeous

300
00:11:21,249 --> 00:11:25,600
pink orange moment I kind of want to

301
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:27,309
just pull the eyeshadow right and

302
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,709
everything and have it all blend it

303
00:11:27,309 --> 00:11:31,420
together which looks so what's done to

304
00:11:29,709 --> 00:11:32,589
you see this is where I get and the look

305
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:34,509
is starts to come together and then I

306
00:11:32,589 --> 00:11:37,779
stop complaining every three seconds

307
00:11:34,509 --> 00:11:42,040
don't take that red shade once again and

308
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:43,269
blend this purple region together I'm

309
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:47,649
gonna bring back a little bit about

310
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:51,850
purple shade and then I want to take a

311
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:53,589
peachy metallic blush shade that is

312
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:55,299
literally my favorite thing the entire

313
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:57,579
world right now and I'm gonna use this

314
00:11:55,299 --> 00:12:01,959
and put it right over the blush region

315
00:11:57,579 --> 00:12:03,309
oh my god and finally last but not least

316
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:04,720
to complete that cheap region I'm just

317
00:12:03,309 --> 00:12:06,100
gonna grab up my favorite blush Mac

318
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,290
peaches which is like this little orange

319
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,910
e moment I'm just a kind of really

320
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:12,429
intense rocker brush and I'm going to

321
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:15,009
for once really pack on that peach blush

322
00:12:12,429 --> 00:12:17,949
right below that pink highlight moment

323
00:12:15,009 --> 00:12:21,399
to really tie it all together oh you're

324
00:12:17,949 --> 00:12:22,720
kidding me I'm so talented just gonna

325
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:24,339
put a little the excess right on my nose

326
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:30,249
because it's a little bit peachy in the

327
00:12:24,339 --> 00:12:31,779
photo looks so cute oh he gonna go back

328
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:35,069
into that white shade because this is

329
00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:35,069
looking a little bit crusted

330
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:45,160
now I'm gonna grab some yellow and put

331
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:47,380
docked right in at the center of the

332
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:49,390
lower lash line and then finally since

333
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:50,800
it is by far my least favorite color in

334
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:52,840
the entire rainbow I'm just gonna place

335
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,910
a little bit of the green shade right

336
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,740
here on in a corner and I'm gonna make a

337
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:58,960
little bit of room for it to be a kind

338
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:05,350
of the inner corner second Cui's moment

339
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:07,930
as well green is literally the ugliest

340
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:09,190
colors right well sorry no offense it's

341
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:11,920
just the truth tea

342
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:14,500
like literally who made green that is

343
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:21,700
gonna mount a great um I need a white

344
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:24,070
gel liner oh I did it ready oh my god

345
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:26,380
great I love when that happens

346
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:28,570
okay this I literally just took me two

347
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:31,090
hours to do um that was neither good nor

348
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:32,620
fresh but that being said I'm gonna go

349
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:34,240
to the other eye off-camera hopefully it

350
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:36,040
does not take me two hours or you may

351
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,360
not see me even back here but assuming

352
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,590
that I'm able to get it done I'll be

353
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,930
right back in a few seconds to finish

354
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:42,310
off the rest of the vlog I'll raise this

355
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:44,050
is we are back up old lights are now

356
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:45,550
done it literally it did take me two

357
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:47,470
hours to do the other eye so that's good

358
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:48,280
I am exhausted and very hungry but you

359
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:51,100
know we're gonna get through this

360
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:52,750
together just like we always do so I

361
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,520
finished you there I um I also popped on

362
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:56,320
the lash Lily lashes in the South Miami

363
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:59,730
using proteins for 15% off and now I'm

364
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,730
going to highlight my face

365
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,030

366
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:07,660

367
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:10,090
like this look it's kind of like rainbow

368
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:12,700
dragon balls find a bigger lash line

369
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:14,050
hello maybe not looking at the face

370
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:17,050

371
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:18,820
rainbow coloured freckles all over which

372
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:21,190
is kind of really cool and fun and fresh

373
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:22,390
so I'm gonna grab a white liner and I

374
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:25,630
guess I'm just gonna dot this like all

375
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:28,080

376
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:30,160

[Music]

382
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,899
there's definitely some definition

383
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:56,279
within the actual little colored dots

384
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:57,990
that we have on the space chart so I

385
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:59,519
just grabbed the NYX vivid bright liquid

386
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:01,320
liners and also a karlie liquid lipstick

387
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,000
in a bright pink shade I think this is

388
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,920
say no more and I'm going to use all

389
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,450
these different colors as well to add in

390
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,960
some more dots just to provide some

391
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:13,530
variation

409
00:16:02,259 --> 00:16:05,259

00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:08,800
of glitter in it let me give myself a

411
00:16:05,259 --> 00:16:13,440

alright you guys oh my god and literally

414
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:23,589
six hours later here is the finished

415
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:26,709
face chart inspired by McLean true ache

416
00:16:23,589 --> 00:16:28,810
a sister Miko all complete oh my god you

417
00:16:26,709 --> 00:16:30,490
guys I love how this turned out let's be

418
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:32,139
real and process was definitely a little

419
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,399
bit of an emotional roller coaster when

420
00:16:32,139 --> 00:16:34,690
I first started out I was having a lot

421
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:36,220
of trouble getting the clothes pigmented

422
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:37,810
blending them together cutting it on the

423
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:39,339
crease getting everything even it was

424
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:41,110
truly a little bit of a sister struggle

425
00:16:39,339 --> 00:16:42,670
to say the least but we got there in the

426
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:43,899
end and I think like I was saying in the

427
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:45,430
video it is definitely one of those

428
00:16:43,899 --> 00:16:47,649
looks that had a quite a few ugly

429
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:49,180
moments in between but in the end it

430
00:16:47,649 --> 00:16:50,589
always turns out looking pretty and this

431
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:53,019
is the finished result and I literally

432
00:16:50,589 --> 00:16:54,459

444
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,329
even believe that that many people took

445
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:14,980
time out of their day to create are

446
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:16,360
obviously my time every single day is to

447
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:17,380
share my art with you guys and the fact

448
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,299
that you guys want to do that with me

449
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:20,380
literally it's so cool it was really

450
00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:21,819
really hard to choose the final winner

451
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:23,799
but I'm definitely happy with the one I

452
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:25,480
selected and that being said though

453
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:26,799
because of all your guys's love and

454
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,850
support on the contest and because of

455
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,620
the fact that this video is uploaded a

456
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:32,049
little bit late due to some legalities

457
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:33,940
try not to get sister soon I decided

458
00:17:32,049 --> 00:17:36,040
it'd be so cool to say thank you to not

459
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:38,230
