00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:53,820
blow it out to a place that has never

26
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:55,170
been done before as a kid growing up a

27
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,699
reality competition show so far

28
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,469
literally it's the only thing that I

29
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:00,149
watch on TV and I find being honest you

30
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:01,800
guys there still to this day at my

31
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:03,420
guilty pleasure and when I first started

32
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,739
getting into makeup and social media one

33
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,390
of my biggest goals that I set for

34
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,760
myself was to have my very own a

35
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,290
competition show one day three years ago

36
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,549
when I first moved to LA I remember

37
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,560
spending one morning sitting in my

38
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:15,420
downtown apartment and creating a full

39
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,060
Notes app document on my phone and

40
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,740
planning out a full concept for a makeup

41
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,299
competition ciao I came up with the name

42
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,380
of the description literally every

43
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:24,150
single challenge that I wanted these

44
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,159
contestants to go through literally

45
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,530
guest judges as well like I was a fully

46
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,939
ready to go at this point but I had

47
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,439
never produced anything like that before

48
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:33,360
I barely even knew how to use my camera

49
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,890
and my lights at the time and an ID like

50
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,200
that honestly just felt a little bit

51
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:40,140
impossible so it just sat in my phone

52
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,460
for literally three years but I had a

53
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,170
really long talk to my team about what I

54
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,850
wanted to do to keep myself inspired and

55
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,439
I brought up the idea of doing it the

56
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,119
reality show and still felt like it was

57
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:49,170
going to be impossible but a few months

58
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:50,250
later after a lot of different

59
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,060
brainstorming sessions a lot of

60
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,320
different meetings with a lot of

61
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,210
different people with a lot of different

62
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,560
companies after a lot of different phone

63
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:58,020
calls and a lot of different sleepless

64
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,090
nights it's becoming a reality and the

65
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,770
impossible it's about to become possible

66
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:07,929
let's talk about it

67
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:09,920
[Music]

68
00:02:07,929 --> 00:02:11,510
when we started talking about actually

69
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,210
making the show a reality the most

70
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:15,590
important part to me by far was that it

71
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:17,780
was authentic and that it was by

72
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:19,040
creators for creators and it showed an

73
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,570
accurate depiction of the beauty

74
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,980
community and what it actually takes to

75
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:23,090
be an influencer and it was very

76
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,620
important to me that I was able to have

77
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:26,780
a say every single step of the way and

78
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,370
also get my hands dirty too I really

79
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,900
wanted to be involved in the last thing

80
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:31,550
that I wanted was to have some like

81
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,810
trillion-dollar sad that I just showed

82
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:34,130
up to every single day with fall and

83
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:36,410
hair and makeup and glam already done

84
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:37,970
and to shoot and call it a day that is

85
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:40,489
not me that has never been me and that

86
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:42,200
will not be the show either and getting

87
00:02:40,489 --> 00:02:45,020
into that level I was honestly a little

88
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:46,640
bit scared because that like feels like

89
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:48,590
a lot to ask for but I am I'm so

90
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,450
grateful that I found the dream team

91
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:52,880
to make that a reality and to have it

92
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:54,470
hosted right here on YouTube

93
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,690
we'll be partnering with a Brian Graydon

94
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:57,890
media for the actual production and I

95
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:59,750
guess we've got around about the show

96
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:01,130
because I am so excited to announce that

97
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,959
it is officially been picked up by

98
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:05,180
YouTube originals as well the show is

99
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,770
set to launch in spring of 2020 so it is

100
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,840
literally only a few months away which

101
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:10,790
is so crazy to even think about it is a

102
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,130
limited series and it is the first ever

103
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:15,980
beauty and social media influence our

104
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:17,480
competition show of its kind ever it is

105
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:19,670
going to be massive and it is going to

106
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:22,250
be posted or right here on youtube.com

107
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:23,780
Asajj James Charles and the reason why

108
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:26,060
this is so cool too is because there is

109
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:29,090
so much going for this it is literally

110
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:32,209
insane but despite all of that it'll be

135
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,709
end only one that can be the grand prize
