00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
hi sisters James Charles here and

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:04,859
welcome back to my youtube channel first

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,569
of all if my voice sounds even more

4
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:08,490
annoying that it normally does please do

5
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:10,050
not comment about it I'm well aware I'm

6
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,059
currently getting over food poisoning

7
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,160
from a very suspicious ravioli that I

8
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:15,960
ate a few years ago I've been a very bit

9
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,789
under the weather but we will never let

10
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,140
that stop my YouTube video production

11
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:20,490
first today today I am very very excited

12
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,320
because we're doing a challenge is

13
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,550
probably a good friend Jackie

14
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,260
if he doesn't follow me for a long time

15
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:26,640
you probably caught on to the fact that

16
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,710
I definitely have my ride-or-die

17
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,080
products and I don't really such a my

18
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,759
makeup routine that often oh really

19
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,290
honestly at all it's been things that

20
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,570
I've gotten caught out for quite a lot

21
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,950
but I'm not a review channel I'm not

22
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,239
really a tutorial channel either and

23
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,410
what I find thing that I love I

24
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:43,230
definitely like to stick to it because

25
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:44,760
it works every once in a while though I

26
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,260
do find that brand new at

27
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,809
diamond-in-the-rough product that I like

28
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:53,250
to just slip right that was quite a

29
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:57,539
sound effect but I like to just come in

30
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:59,760
late to just doesn't like to just slide

31
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:02,160
that was a good wide that was the fun

32
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,960
side of that then I like to just slide

33
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,850
right into the makeup routine and it

34
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,729
quickly becomes one of my all-time holy

35
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,619
ground favorites to be used and hundreds

36
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:12,780
of videos have to the fact and for today

37
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:15,210
I thought it'll be so much fun to put my

38
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,280
makeup knowledge to the test and ask how

39
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:19,380
well do I really know my own a beauty

40
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,360
routine for the show today I sent my

41
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,920
team on a very difficult mission they

42
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,479
set out with all my favorite products

43
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,460
right every day at beauty routine and

44
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,680
they found it too very similar if not

45
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:31,079
little exact dupe products they

46
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,329
unpackaged all three and then repackaged

47
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:34,829
all three into the exact same packaging

48
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:36,600
so it looks like it's the same product

49
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:38,970
but it's not and I'm going to have to

50
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,340
use my touch the application the smell

51
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:43,380
and my eyesight obviously to try and

52
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,450
figure out if I actually know which out

53
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,479
of the three products is my actual

54
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:50,159
favorite that I use all the time I'm not

55
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:51,329
going into this I am pretty confident

56
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,399
considering I literally use these

57
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:55,170
products almost every single day I'm not

58
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:57,810
even sure I made it this far this a

59
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,640
beauty guru but who knows I could get

60
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:01,079
literally all of them wrong and I also

61
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,430
may find some really amazing products

62
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,770
that I would like to add to my routine

63
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:06,090
so that further ado oh not without

64
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,430
further ado but one last thing to tell

65
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,870

86
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:49,510
lot of you guys been asking for mint I

87
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,800
was convinced that this was mint and I

88
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:54,550
have since been informed that this is in

89
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,140
fact not mint its spearmint I guess if

90
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,400
you want to call it we can definitely do

91
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:59,320
a mint one in the future but regardless

92
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,270
I think this color is still so beyond

93
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,830
cute if you guys want to check out any

94
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:04,510

lavender and teal and matching your

105
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,880
honey colors I thought it'd be so much

106
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,410
fun to start releasing a phone cases

107
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,910
every time we have a new colored hoodies

00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:29,620

00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,970

110
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,170

always they're available in a bunch of

112
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,420
different iPhone models they'll also be

113
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,920
launching at the same times everything

114
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:38,260
else okay that is all I have without

115
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,330
further ado now let's see how I know I

116
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:45,700
make up routine

117
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:48,170
[Music]

118
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,970
so you're all primed and ready to go

119
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:53,050
yes the first step of your makeup

120
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:57,620
routine is foundation so here we have

121
00:03:53,050 --> 00:04:06,320
NARS two-phase and is that the order

122
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:07,460
that they're in okay okay okay I'm

123
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,220
already noticing that this one's a

124
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:12,800
little bit more chunky

125
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:14,510
like not like chunky for like a little

126
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,740
it's like a little bit thicker whereas

127
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:17,900
opposed like this one is definitely like

128
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:19,130
a little bit more watery but I also

129
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,080
don't know when you put these in this

130
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:22,880
bowl so I'm noticing that these two

131
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:24,830
colors on the right hand are definitely

132
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,650
a little bit more like neutral toned

133
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:31,280
which is good for me and this was a

134
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:33,470
little bit more peachy orange color so I

135
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:40,100
think I actually know exactly what the

136
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:44,030
order of these is okay and I do know it

137
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:46,370
okay that smells like paint that is

138
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:48,440
literal that is paint is this acrylic

139
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:51,320
paint that's not a funny joke if you did

140
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:53,030
that to me is really okay I mean it's

141
00:04:51,320 --> 00:05:05,990
all like good paint like I would sniff

142
00:04:53,030 --> 00:05:08,270
that paint again okay okay this one's

143
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:10,310
much like stickier and I feels cold

144
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:13,430
while going on that's not a familiar

145
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:14,510
feeling I do know what the three of

146
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:19,580
these are I'm a genius

147
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:22,070
oh okay I know per thought that this one

148
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:22,250
is the Too Faced one I'm confident in

149
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,440
that

150
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:26,270
this is born this way for sure okay so I

151
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,620
know the goal this challenge is just to

152
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:30,620
pick out my favorite of the three and

153
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:32,210
then apply it but just for my ego sake I

154
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:34,729
said I want to try to label all three

155
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:35,990
just refine it so a final answer we have

156
00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:39,260
to boots but on this way

157
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:41,570
NARS and then derive elimination

158
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:42,680
am i right well the sisters know but we

159
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:44,050
don't want to build your ego so we're

160
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,880
going

161
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:48,530
see if I can drop me to the end I'm

162
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,210
gonna go ahead and wipe my three fingers

163
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:51,920
off that and I'm going to dip into my

164
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:53,480
amazing a to face for the safe

165
00:05:51,920 --> 00:06:00,410
foundation that I know and love and use

166
00:05:53,480 --> 00:06:02,750
every single day is this am I wrong oh I

167
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:05,150
think I'm right this is definitely born

168
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:07,400
this way yeah cutter percent it's the

169
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:13,450
smell it smells very clean I know

170
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:17,000
[Music]

171
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:18,320
so now that your foundation is on yes to

172
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,100
the next step yes

173
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:24,110
so concealer here we lovely in front of

174
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:31,700
you we have tarp shake

175
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:33,500
okay Matt oh pro longwear yes oh okay

176
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:36,440
this I am NOT covenant because I use the

177
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:38,270
tarp tape tape all the time I don't

178
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,680
think I've ever actually once used the

179
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:41,870
bond Pro Longwear concealer except for

180
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,390
as an eye base and I just started using

181
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:46,790
this away at coverage concealer recently

182
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:50,120
but I don't think I'd like use it enough

183
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:51,770
to know it's smell and texture yeah well

184
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,780
I already see this one is a little bit

185
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:56,420
darker for sure and a little bit more

186
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:58,520
like peaches honed this one is super

187
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:59,900
super light and this one is like a very

188
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:05,300
like middle-of-the-road a type of

189
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:07,040
concealer that is quite the strong scent

190
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:11,210
I don't know why but I think that's not

191
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:12,890
prolong wear this there's a shame shame

192
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:14,840

00:08:35,939 --> 00:08:39,360
powder in the middle has it some chunks

219
00:08:37,379 --> 00:08:40,829
than that this is no shade I know that

220
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,750
the first batch of matcha powder that I

221
00:08:40,829 --> 00:08:44,129
thought was a bad one but I know it's

222
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:46,050

223
00:08:44,129 --> 00:08:49,829
is it the powder powder is phenomenal by

little bit more orange a tone so this is

256
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:40,770
definitely a bronzer this middle one is

257
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:42,840
a little bit more cool tone which leads

258
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:45,240
me to believe that it maybe the Anasazi

259
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:48,840
won just because I know that this one is

260
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:50,430
from a contour kit and this last one is

261
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:53,010
definitely a little bit more of a deeper

262
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:56,600
bronzy color that is benefit hoola

263
00:10:53,010 --> 00:11:01,440

and for us and snaps using actually my

295
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:15,660
Anasazi eyebrow products as always and I

296
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:27,660
moving on to our next step which is I

297
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:30,140
think going to be if I don't get this

298
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:34,320
right I'm literally gonna be cancelled

299
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:38,780
Oh which one has colors colors from each

300
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:48,950
so we can match up the color okay I

301
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:51,990
[Music]

302
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:54,540
honestly think that I know already but

303
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:55,770
if I am wrong this is literally to be

304
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,720
the most embarrassing thing that's ever

305
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:59,550
happened to me in a challenge before but

306
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,090
okay so here's here's where my brain is

307
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:02,880
going okay

308
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:04,410
the left hand a pink shade has a little

309
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:08,070
bit of shimmer reflect in it which my

310
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:09,930
pink skip 100% does not have so I think

311
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:11,820
this is from the new Anasazi Riviera

312
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:14,490
palette I think the middle row is mine

313
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:16,470
because out of these three like magenta

314
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:18,930
shades in the middle the one in the

315
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:21,300
middle is the most like burgundy whereas

316
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:23,190
these two or more pink and I think that

317
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:25,650
this left-hand column is Jeffrey's

318
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:28,320
because this tone of pink is a little

319
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:30,780
bit more peachy which i think would be a

320
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,000
very Jeffrey type of pink and this fella

321
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:34,800
needs a little bit more purple the black

322
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,290
I have nothing so I'm just noting you

323
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,460
put them in the right order

324
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:42,350
Jeffrey saw her husband James

325
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:42,350
Charlesworth a palette in the middle and

326
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:50,350
okay I'm gonna put my two very dear

327
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:51,370
friends off to the side I will not be

328
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,960
using them today about I love people

329
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:54,400
this is definitely skipped like I know

330
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,410
for a fact this pink is just like too

331
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,940
bright to be somebody else's that's

332
00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:12,910
definitely my baby oh my god I didn't do

333
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:15,280
a swatch test before well that's better

334
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:17,140
I think I'm gonna do a halo I look

335
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:19,360
inspired by the one that I did in my

336
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:20,650
campaign the bubble gum moment cuz I

337
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,630
literally could not think of another

338
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:24,670
look that I would want to use pink

339
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:28,510
burgundy and black for gonna dip with

340
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:28,900
Miami four five six brush into skip it

341
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,640
skip

342
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:32,140
I know it's skip and it's literally you

343
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:36,640
cannot tell me otherwise you see that

344
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:41,200
staining mama oh you know that is

345
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:42,880
definitely staining that's skip then

346
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,520
with an amplifier most excited if into

347
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,680
what I believe is boutique from my

348
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:50,260
palette I hope is boutique for my palate

349
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,340
I know is boutique for my palate and

350
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:53,260
then finally with that same brush to

351
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:55,270
stepping into a little bit of a spooky

352
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:57,180
the black color and using this to deepen

353
00:14:55,270 --> 00:15:07,069
out just the internal corners

354
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:09,569

00:15:24,149 --> 00:15:27,899
either of that yeah you got bored if

366
00:15:26,189 --> 00:15:30,569
either suit god of course you guys can

367
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:31,769
use coatings for 50% off your chest but

368
00:15:30,569 --> 00:15:33,600
the look is pretty much all complete we

369
00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:40,739
only have a few it stops left the next

370
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:42,540
one being a highlighter I believe there

371
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:47,100
is a lot on the line as well

372
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:49,259
because we got face from your oh no we

373
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:55,009
have they all look exactly the same

374
00:15:49,259 --> 00:15:55,009
oh yeah from the balm

375
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:01,649
okay so literally when I created face I

376
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,939
went into the morphe studio with like

377
00:16:01,649 --> 00:16:04,709
all of my favorite highlighters those

378
00:16:02,939 --> 00:16:06,509
like I want to mix up all these and so

379
00:16:04,709 --> 00:16:07,769
Hollywood was like my biggest source of

380
00:16:06,509 --> 00:16:09,449
inspiration for face

381
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:10,739
considering I always wore it they're

382
00:16:09,449 --> 00:16:12,209
very similar colors I will let you know

383
00:16:10,739 --> 00:16:14,959
right now that's all hey what doesn't

384
00:16:12,209 --> 00:16:17,789
exist anymore but it does today mama

385
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:26,809
okay let me do a little swatch I'm gonna

386
00:16:17,789 --> 00:16:26,809
do a swatch test beautiful

387
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:36,250
awesome beautiful I am almost positive

388
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:38,290
that the this one on the left here is

389
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:40,540
mary-lou manizer from the balm because

390
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:44,079
out of the three swatches it is the

391
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:46,389
lightest and also the like least not

392
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:48,579
reflective but it's a very like flat

393
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:50,529
shape whereas both these two definitely

394
00:16:48,579 --> 00:16:52,360
have like later pearls and darker pearls

395
00:16:50,529 --> 00:16:54,009
in it mary lou manizer is very flat and

396
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,839
i remember that from always using it

397
00:16:54,009 --> 00:16:58,449
beforehand so I'm pretty confident that

398
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:00,310
this one is Miss Mary Lu we can

399
00:16:58,449 --> 00:17:03,310
eliminate her okay so now between these

400
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:06,189
two I think I do now this top one is

401
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:08,650
slightly more gold tone than the one

402
00:17:06,189 --> 00:17:11,110
below it this one is a little bit more

403
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:13,809
peachy which leads me to believe that

404
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:16,689
the top one is honest Asya so Hollywood

405
00:17:13,809 --> 00:17:18,039
and the middle one is faced from the

406
00:17:16,689 --> 00:17:20,439
James Charles exploring palette and the

407
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:24,189
bottom one would be mary lou manizer

408
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:24,819
from the balm Mary Lu James Charles X

409
00:17:24,189 --> 00:17:29,770
Murphy

410
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:32,520
Anasazi so Hollywood oh that is

411
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:32,520
definitely my highlighter

412
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:38,869
[Music]

413
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:49,539
so games yes Louis

414
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:49,539
god bless my quiz is over okay lipstick

415
00:17:51,610 --> 00:18:01,399
Sao Paulo my family yes okay what are

416
00:17:59,659 --> 00:18:03,950
your first thoughts the middle one is

417
00:18:01,399 --> 00:18:07,700
dark I'm Augustus Melhem is what I'm

418
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:09,860
actually going to do this is over a

419
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:12,289
hundred percent over lipsticks smell

420
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:15,440
like cupcakes 100 percent old from Sao

421
00:18:12,289 --> 00:18:16,909
Paulo and positive this is Kylie I know

422
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:26,320
this is Kylie because I've used her lips

423
00:18:16,909 --> 00:18:37,369
like so many times definitely Kylie okay

424
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:40,429
uh-huh house passive-aggressive she's

425
00:18:37,369 --> 00:18:43,249
gonna dip into my lovely sau Paula look

426
00:18:40,429 --> 00:18:45,970
a lipstick that I do love which you can

427
00:18:43,249 --> 00:18:53,779
use ko James for 30% off off by the way

428
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:58,850
mmm tastes like cupcakes okay how did I

429
00:18:53,779 --> 00:19:01,399
do I don't know okay my face looks very

430
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:03,019
normal like this looks like I created a

431
00:19:01,399 --> 00:19:05,240
normal look using a normal product so

432
00:19:03,019 --> 00:19:08,330
I'm gonna hope that I got pretty close

433
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:10,610
to a hundred percent right so you

434
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:13,279
definitely get a point if you guess the

435
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:14,480
one you usually use yeah but it's bonus

436
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:17,539
if you guess the others

437
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,470
okay so for foundation we had NARS yes

438
00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:21,440
two things

439
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:22,759

was on Saskia yeah upon that I used as

452
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:06,389
