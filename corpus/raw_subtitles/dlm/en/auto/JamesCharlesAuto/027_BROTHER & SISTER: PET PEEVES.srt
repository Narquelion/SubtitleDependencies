biggest pet peeve is immaturity I hate

when people don't act age if they should

30
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:51,720
like James that is literally it so far

31
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,729
every single kid set as my age literally

32
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,009
is in college failing all other classes

33
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:59,090
and partying every night getting crunk

34
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:59,090
and I'm here running an empire

35
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:02,890
you hang out a little bit the most

36
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:07,240
immature people ever Hey

37
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:10,780
stop throwing shade and they're all

38
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:12,010
immature you're yo that is such a lie

39
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:14,170
your friend group is literally the

40
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:15,820
definition of immature you literally

41
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:17,440
went to a sauna a few weeks ago and were

42
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:19,690
stopped enemy at 2:00 in the morning

43
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,570
farting in the sauna with your friends

44
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:24,460
it was funny it's not funny that is

45
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:26,200
pretty funny some older lady wanted to

46
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:27,490
just enjoy her time in the sauna and you

47
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,800
guys weren't sitting there farting and

48
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:32,950
snapchat she probably wanted to dog she

49
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:36,540
probably did die assumes that's also one

50
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:36,540
of my pet peeves you like to talk a lot

51
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:41,080
you don't talk enough so I would rather

52
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,760
not talk and then have you talked the

53
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,020
whole time tell him to shut up

54
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,460

well maybe you should open person oh

59
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,800
she's changed her transformation in

60
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:58,330
school people that don't feel like

61
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,250
paying attention as I could talk and

62
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:02,290
like mess with the teacher not annoy me

63
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:04,720
I think that is you in school though I

64
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:06,610
don't talk in school man every single

65
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,420
class has had my headphones in and like

66
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:09,670
slept the whole time

67
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:11,260
oh we're one of those kids I cannot send

69
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:15,700
obnoxious and loud in public immature is

70
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:17,410
a weird topic to like talk about but I

71
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,270
think like everyone is annoyed that

72
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:20,910
can't really bring ideas to it you know

73
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:23,620
what I mean

74
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:25,690
maturity is an epidemic this is not a

75
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:29,110
PSA thank you for coming to our TED talk

76
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:32,470

77
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:34,239
tell you I like when things go my whack

78
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:36,580
and not in like the business we're all

79
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,680
not like video uploads not in like karma

80
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:40,450
I like when things happen how they're

81
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,709
supposed to happen sometimes when those

82
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:43,750
things don't happen how they're supposed

83
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:45,420
to happen a rush of anger goes through

84
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,709
my body like no other

85
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:50,120
listen like when you're coming home

86
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:52,430
after very long time

87
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:55,670
right and you take off your shoes using

88
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:58,129
one but to kick it off and then you have

89
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:59,840
one shoe left on one foot and you try to

90
00:03:58,129 --> 00:04:01,910
take it off and the shoe doesn't come

91
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,400
off by the way literally makes me want

92
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:06,080
to scream I don't know why oh when

93
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,519
you're putting on shoes like you step on

94
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,720
the back and they get stuck and you

95
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:13,310
can't pull it off when it hurts your

96
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:15,349
finger annoying oh this it goes along

97
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:17,810
with this - I have a hair dryer in my

98
00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:20,660
bathroom it was a $400 hair dryer which

99
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:28,100
blows my mind literally why it does do a

100
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:31,669
good job I will say a prayer to God this

101
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:35,120
hair dryers cord is literally like the

102
00:04:31,669 --> 00:04:37,160
strongest being I've ever encountered in

103
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,290
my entire life how can a poor be strong

104
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,690
across literally let me tell you this

105
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:44,270
cord is plugged into my wall okay and I

106
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:47,810
have a pretty small bathroom sink and

107
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:51,669
for some reason whenever I move the

108
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:54,110
hairdryer to start using it first yes

109
00:04:51,669 --> 00:04:55,880
that is exactly the issue and I don't

110
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:58,669
know why it is one of those things were

111
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:00,560
for some reason this cord was made so

112
00:04:58,669 --> 00:05:03,169
strong that whenever I pick it up to use

113
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,370
it the second it even moves everything

114
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:06,500
comes off the counter with it why it

115
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:07,970
wasn't made that way who made a cord not

116
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,919
these sound like the dumbest issues ever

117
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:11,660
but they really just get me so angry all

118
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,620
I want to do is do my hair I don't wanna

119
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,090
sit there and have to pick up every

120
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:16,910
single thing off my bathroom floor

121
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:18,020
we'll use and what about you well yeah I

122
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:18,950
just leave it there because it gets me

123
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,570
so angry

124
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:23,229
every time I do I heard my heavy I

125
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:25,180
usually always scream in some way

126
00:05:23,229 --> 00:05:26,379
just move your hairdryer to a different

127
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:28,360
place I don't think there's any other

128
00:05:26,379 --> 00:05:30,069
plugs in that bathroom put it in the

129
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:33,310
living room with a big mirror and you

130
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:35,139
got a bunch room for activities what I

131
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:36,370
don't have to walk out of my bathroom to

132
00:05:35,139 --> 00:05:38,259
go to the living room to do my hair

133
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:39,939
that's like inconvenient practical

134
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:41,860
instead of knocking everything over I

135
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:43,479
guess that is true he's known as

136
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:45,039
personal problems that you can fix very

137
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:46,659
easily this is just like a subcategory

138
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,090
of pet peeves it's just a bunch of

139
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:51,819
umbrella things that all just make you

140
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:53,949
so mad how do you not even understand

141
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:55,240
this cuz they're personal problems yes

142
00:05:53,949 --> 00:05:57,099
what fixes don't you have these little

143
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,810
things that like that they don't exactly

144
00:05:57,099 --> 00:06:01,210
work right away it just makes you so oh

145
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:04,360
oh my phone doesn't charge like when the

146
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:06,400
chargers in there yes yes I'm a computer

147
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,020
desk I have these like charging ports

148
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,449
that I use and you kind of stick your

149
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:11,830
phone on there my iPhone is so old and

150
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:14,199
crosses the charger never works like I

151
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:15,849
literally have to sit there and shove it

152
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:17,050
on there like eight times until it

153
00:06:15,849 --> 00:06:18,219
actually registers that it's charging

154
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:22,719
that is another one of those things that

155
00:06:18,219 --> 00:06:31,389
I get so when you kick butt you can't

156
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:32,589
find a TV remote in your bed covers yeah

157
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:33,969
and then you shuffle your bed sheets

158
00:06:32,589 --> 00:06:36,430
then you're claustrophobic get right

159
00:06:33,969 --> 00:06:37,930
back to the get a lovino it with James's

160
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:39,399
arrived difinitely notice how many you

161
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,839
scissors actually recognized us in

162
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,279
public and I think I got really good at

163
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:44,500
talking you guys you meet you guys but

164
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:45,099
there's a few things that tend to get on

165
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:57,759
my nerves

166
00:06:45,099 --> 00:07:00,129
Oh fan pet peeves Oh risky topic people

167
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,289
in public probably my favorite aspect of

168
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:03,520
this entire job is to get to thank the

169
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:05,710
people face-to-face citizens including

170
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,629
me at sensei Juan truly such a cool

171
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:10,029
experience that is like just rolling her

172
00:07:07,629 --> 00:07:14,919
every time there are however some

173
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:17,529
situations where it is so not cool one

174
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:20,660
of them being when I'm eating dinner oh

175
00:07:17,529 --> 00:07:24,060
my god

176
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:28,580
just wait like ten minutes

177
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:28,580
so rude and everytime happens I'm like

178
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:33,810
nice to meet you too and it's usually

179
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:35,400
not the kids either it's the parents who

180
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:37,760
will come up to the table with their

181
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,600
kids and drilling behind them and say

182
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,820

221
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:37,990
facebook so I can check it out later I

222
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:39,730

00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:41,530
photo with you but if you are too

224
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:44,470
nervous and if you send your parrot over

225
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:46,510
please give them a brief synopsis of who

226
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:47,680
you'll be taking a photo with so one I

227
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:49,540
don't feel really uncomfortable having

228
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,220
to explain to them what I'm doing

229
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:52,810
because that's weird that makes me feel

230
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:56,350
very very egotistical and that it's not

231
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:57,949
font so let's stop doing that please and

232
00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:01,860
thank you

233
00:09:57,949 --> 00:10:03,510
Oh usually meanie fans in person is a

234
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:08,820
great expense but there is one thing

235
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:10,649
online that really okay what is that so

236
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:12,510
you know those like voting things where

237
00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:16,110
they get like six of us so it'd be like

238
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:18,449
me you the Dolan yeah like vote who you

239
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:20,010
would want out first what they're so I

240
00:10:18,449 --> 00:10:21,930
don't like them either what is the point

241
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:24,089
of that first of all second of all get

242
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:27,690
really angry when I get voted out it

243
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:30,000
I've never won one me I mean I will

244
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:31,139
admit at dusk it's annoying

245
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,579
it does feel pretty guy when you're

246
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:34,500
looking at one and you like see yourself

247
00:10:32,579 --> 00:10:35,940
make it to the next round kind of I'm

248
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,589
not gonna lie yeah but it's at the same

249
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:40,230
point but then when you get voted out it

250
00:10:37,589 --> 00:10:42,630
really one of my biggest pet peeves

251
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:46,769
probably the top pet peeve to me is when

252
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:48,209
people think money buys fashion like

253
00:10:46,769 --> 00:10:50,250
when people spend thousands of dollars

254
00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:55,829
on clothes by having no idea how to wear

255
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:58,829
it you know what I mean like don't get

256
00:10:55,829 --> 00:11:00,660
like don't get like $2,000 Gucci pants I

257
00:10:58,829 --> 00:11:02,370
like red and blue and they get like a

258
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,899
supreme shirt that's yellow and black

259
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:07,949
but this coat a hundred dollars I think

260
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:09,779
it works well and it doesn't ever no

261
00:11:07,949 --> 00:11:11,010
you're right just because they sent a

262
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:12,870
thousand dollars at a luxury store does

263
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:15,029
not mean it's gonna look good in fact

264
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:16,680
it's usually gonna look bad there's

265
00:11:15,029 --> 00:11:18,480
things that really had a mass cuz

266
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:20,600
there's just one certain youtuber not

267
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,600
gonna name any names

268
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:27,240
um just because you wear a lot of

269
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,279
expensive items they're not gonna go

270
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,889
well together for not the same color or

271
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:34,600
not the same like style at all so fix

272
00:11:31,889 --> 00:11:36,830
that if you were watching

273
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,470
I just don't like that was the worst

274
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:40,790
call-out ever that's going from you

275
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:44,180
someone who literally cannot match an

276
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:46,160
alpha to save their life this is only

277
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:48,790
the most first real problem issue I will

278
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:51,680
ever talk about on social media but

279
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:56,900
seriously that really gets me good gal

280
00:11:51,680 --> 00:12:01,450
my job is very immobilize iMac but I

281
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:06,350
also have a laptop an iPad and an iPhone

282
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:08,420
they're all connected okay they're all

283
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:10,160
connected through my iCloud and the

284
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:16,280
whole point of iCloud is to sync all of

285
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:18,140
your devices together why is it but it's

286
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:20,750
not how it works no you you would think

287
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:22,670
but of course you nothing ever goes how

288
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,960
you wanted to go if you walked in this

289
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:25,670
ear welcome for this you can descend me

290
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:28,460
a check later how much that work is that

291
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:31,700
if I am working on my iMac for several

292
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:34,370
hours then I click Save which you do

293
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:37,130
every single time and you put your iMac

294
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:39,140
to sleep if I open my laptop and they're

295
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:44,120
all connected it should be the same

296
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:45,620
exact act like why is it not that way

297
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,900
how about you desired that mr.

298
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:50,000
smartypants probably well obviously

299
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:51,230
probably won't know probably well

300
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,850
somebody else needs to do that okay

301
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:56,390
that's just how it should work

302
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:59,660

00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:09,080
like what do you want for dinner

00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:16,910
you but I answer it five minutes late

313
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,620
