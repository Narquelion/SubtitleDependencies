7
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:14,490
pouring rain which honestly I love I

8
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:16,320
love a good rainy day and it's just so

9
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,580
calm and comfortable since it is pouring

10
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,380
rain today we were not able to take him

11
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,640
on his at normal morning walk and we

12
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,769
honestly didn't even want him to be

13
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,970
brilliant outside much today because he

14
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:25,710
got soaking wet we had a little airy

15
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,240
give him a shower but in order to do

16
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,560
something fun that with Finnegan today I

17
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,119
thought we would do a video that has not

18
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,340
even requested and since we got him a

19
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:34,110
few months ago and that is a puppy it

20
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,070
picks my makeup well honestly he's not

21
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,440
even really a puppy at this point I

22
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,460

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,700
like put this on here I was really

186
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:21,810
scared that by applying this with a

187
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,040
brush it was going to really get very

188
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:25,770
very like shining shimmering splendid

189
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,720
effect on the skin but it definitely

190
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:29,250
it's not it is still setting everything

191
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,490
in plates but it does have a really nice

192
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:33,780
like shy you're kidding

193
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:35,310
I definitely looking forward to playing

194
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:37,170
this a little bit more and seeing what

195
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:39,840
it's capable of but so far

196
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:41,700
holy waiting yeah cool we are looking a

197
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,560
very flat and I desperately want to add

198
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,330
some contour back to the face so I'm

199
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,190
going to grab the Anasazi Beverly Hills

200
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:48,720
at contour palette that Finn so kindly

201
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:51,810
selected and that Bryce just going to

202
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,670
grab my actually mac-11 3us brush and

203
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:55,440
I'm just going to grab the kind of light

204
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:56,430
shade in the light banana shade and use

205
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,350
a little bit of this to highlight the

206
00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:00,420
center of my face then I was gonna grab

207
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:02,790
my morphe am at 405 brush use code after

208
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:03,960
10% and dip into the middle cool telenet

209
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:05,730
shade of this palette I think the shade

210
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,200
is actually called fawn if I remember

211
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:08,850
correctly it's gonna use a little bit of

212
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,810
this dish as well my cheekbones my

213
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:11,790
forehead look a little bit smaller

214
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:14,310
especially with my hair in the growing

215
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:15,420
back recovery up process that's honestly

216
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:16,680
been the most frustrating thing of like

217
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,550
this whole hair journey I feel like I've

218
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,410
talked about this a million times

219
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:20,970
already but you guys know that I used to

220
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:22,170
have like my little curly hair where I

221
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:23,580
would like kind of swoop over the

222
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:24,300
forehead and give the illusion of like a

223
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:26,220
tiny here

224
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:31,650
hairline yeah can't do that anymore so

225
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:33,150
that's been really on my mind to get it

226
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:34,920
then lastly cover um five to seven I'm

227
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,750
just gonna dip into the warmer tone

228
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,400
shade away in this left-hand corner and

229
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,870
I'm going to use this to kind of warm up

230
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,340
my face a little bit timewe nose contour

231
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:43,980
brussels gonna use a mix of these two

232
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:45,780
colors and chisel out the nose as well

233
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:48,060
or even a sofa blush to fit picked my

234
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:49,560
go-to favorite Mac peaches he only had

235
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:51,270
two options it was either pink or peach

236
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:54,150
instead of divid with my evil brush and

237
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:56,400
not a little bit of a color back into my

238
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:57,870
cheek region just for a nice little wash

239
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,820
already base and I would have time for

240
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:01,200
brows and fana did pick the Anasazi

241
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:03,090
Beverly Hills brow is in the shade and

242
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,380
medium brown that being said you guys to

243
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,520
me do this a million times I'm going to

244
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,750
do this off camera quickly and I'll be

245
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,950
right back to do it the eyeshadow

246
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:10,680
portion because that's what it's gonna

247
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:12,150
start getting a little questionable ah

248
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,560
so the brows are all on and now that

249
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:16,470
means it is time for the eyeshadow

250
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:18,870
portion now the colors that Finnegan

251
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:21,420
chose for this look today

252
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:25,500
I would say it wouldn't be my first

253
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:27,480
choice of eyeshadow colors to use we

254
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:31,800
have socialblade daddy Cola and acapella

255
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:33,090
and then tune okay I'm gonna survive I'm

256
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,490
gonna have what four five six brush and

257
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:38,580
dip into a daddy and I'm going to place

258
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:40,320
this into the crease and now I'm going

259
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:42,090
to grab and then four three three brush

260
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,040
dip into a social blade which is our

261
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:46,350
bright green shade and I'm going to use

262
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:48,930
this and like just barely blend out the

263
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:51,870
edge of that daddy can I have an m4 for

264
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:54,090
one and dip into tune and use this to

265
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:55,380
just buff out that green pitch have

266
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:58,800
another girl what kind of look that I

267
00:12:55,380 --> 00:13:00,000
wanted to do for this and I really have

268
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,130
to come to the collusion that the red

269
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,660
lip is going to mess it up later on so

270
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:04,410
we're just gonna cut the crease and hope

271
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,120
for the best

272
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:08,190
I will change out the lip for the

273
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:11,910
Instagram photo now on this cut crease

274
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:13,860
I'm going to grab a sigma e27 brush and

275
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:15,930
just dip into it Cola and I'm gonna

276
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,970
place this right in this outer corner

277
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:20,400
over top with this concealer and this is

278
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:22,680
going to blend nicely into Daddy and

279
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:25,890
then with a flat brush I'm going to grab

280
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:27,870
acapella and I'm gonna place that in the

281
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:29,280
middle of the lid this looks so pretty

282
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:32,370
and it's gonna get completely ruined by

283
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:33,510
a red lip I cannot get that oh it's

284
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:34,860
never for the lower lashline it's gonna

285
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:36,450
be super easy I'm just gonna first grab

286
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:38,640
Miami four five six once again and dip

287
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:41,040
into a little bit of dotty and I'm just

288
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,420
gonna run this right up along my lash

289
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,550
line and connecting it to the outer

290
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:47,160
corner and then finally a little bit of

291
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:48,090
a tune to tie it all together just to

292
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,680
make this look a little bit more sultry

293
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:52,470

294
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:54,390

00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:55,770
bit of a wing Finn did not pick this but

296
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,460
I'm making the executive decision that

297
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,930
it needs it

298
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,400

more like natural glam a type of makeup

310
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,920
and a lot of sovereignty makeup artists

311
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,180
actually use these on their clients

312
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,370
really don't want a crazy

313
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:26,990
look so I'm not gonna rush them they're

314
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:28,160

315
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:30,800

00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:35,110
like a natural glam and see how they

319
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:37,670
look but for this particular look I

320
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:39,529

then we'll come back and do the rest of

325
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:45,860
the look which might not look so

with the copper eye and nude lip

341
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:11,480
literally if you guys been around since

342
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,810
day one when I first started on social

343
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,190
media

344
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,450
in the beginning I got a Twitter fight

345
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:17,089
with Manny because I called him out for

346
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:18,560
only to cuff her eyes and nude lips it

347
00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:19,790
was so stupid it was a huge mistake and

348
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,290
it came from a really really big place

349
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:22,640
of entitlement when I was really really

350
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:23,750
uh and I'm very grateful that men and

351
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,370
they were able to work it out and now

352
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,690
I'm so lucky to call her my closest

353
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:28,190
friends in the community just wanted to

354
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:29,660

00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:30,949

356
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,660
much and I am very very happy for him

365
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:51,440
last step of a sec which is of course

366
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:53,300
going to be at the lipstick fan

367
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,949
picked the Fenty beauteous Sun and let

368
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:57,230
paint in the color uncensored which is a

369
00:15:54,949 --> 00:15:59,149
beautiful red color I love this lipstick

370
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:02,120
but I did not like this lipstick for

371
00:15:59,149 --> 00:16:04,220
this look like this is just not a red

372
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:09,949
lip look we're just gonna go ahead and

373
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:12,620
apply it so Dinah this looks so bad oh

374
00:16:09,949 --> 00:16:16,699
my god this is the ugliest combination

375
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:21,339
are you kidding all right the look is

376
00:16:16,699 --> 00:16:21,339
done what do you think do you like it

377
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:27,380
hello he said I regret the red/black do

378
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:28,490
you want to keep hanging on oh yeah okay

379
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,660

380
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:31,760

381
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:34,070
that is this makeup picked by my puppy a

382
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,120
Finnegan Hall complete I am really

383
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:36,290
really happy with how this makeup look

384
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,720
turned out today aside from of course

385
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:40,700
red lip I think this foundation in

386
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,840
powder combo looks stunning on the skin

387
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,190
and I think that the color actually

388
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,600
ended up being really really good in the

389
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:46,220
end so I'm really pumped to keep using

390
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,600
