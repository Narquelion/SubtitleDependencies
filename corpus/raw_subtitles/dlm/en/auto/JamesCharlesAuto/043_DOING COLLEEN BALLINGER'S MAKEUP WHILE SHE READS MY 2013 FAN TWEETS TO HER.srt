they know where it has to be there

122
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:34,770
somewhere now I think about I remember

123
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,010
me and my best friend at the time

124
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:40,380
complaining that Rachel took the photo

125
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:46,380
mm anything gonna be blurry and maybe

126
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:49,139
not posted for the way I'm gonna grab

127
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:50,250
the Stila liquid metal thingies these

128
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:51,450
things are sort of everybody what

129
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:54,990
they're actually called but this is the

130
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:55,730
shade of Kenton karma your have used

131
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,800
these before

132
00:05:55,730 --> 00:06:01,250
okay so you need to look down okay and

133
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:06,080
not look up and then Josh goes mad yeah

134
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:07,310
okay I'll be great what these go on like

135
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,570
a liquid but then they dry down and

136
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:10,250
click on that better so they don't move

137
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:15,850
either in the prettiest pepper and

138
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:15,850
they're gonna hurt it is there so I says

139
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:21,399
[Music]

140
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:28,580
I will say this like I get my makeup

141
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,260
done

142
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,700
everyone's to offer like events and

143
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:33,830
stuff makeup artists always complain

144
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,850
about like beauty gurus online and how

145
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:36,140
they're all fake and they don't know

146
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:38,360
what they're doing and like they're

147
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:41,030
taking their jobs and blah blah blah bit

148
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,980
they're so they're so bad about it but

149
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:45,200
let me just tell you I have never liked

150
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:46,760
how any of them have done me know like I

151
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,710
always prefer like when I do collabs

152
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,940
with YouTube friends and like they do my

153
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:51,290
makeup and like it always looks so much

154
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:53,060
better because you know I think I think

155
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:54,710
that like when you learn how like be a

156
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:56,930
makeup artist basically how to care for

157
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:57,950
a client as a makeup artist has a lot

158
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:59,270
different than like actually doing

159
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,920
makeup but I think the thought knowledge

160
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:02,960
is something that a lot of the YouTube

161
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,280
people including myself don't have like

162
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,840
I will never sit there like Jen I'm a

163
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,730
professional makeup artist because I'm

164
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,950
not you can't sit there to explain and

165
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:11,690
properly sanitize all my brushes really

166
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:13,100
prevent diseases and something I've seen

167
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:16,100
all the same all my friends and

168
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:17,600
good but what I don't like is I feel

169
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,670
like a lot of those people feel like

170
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,990
because they've been working at a lot

171
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:22,610
longer because they work it like I

172
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:24,230
support are back that they're for some

173
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:26,060
reason better or more talented which is

174
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:27,770
so far from the case because the amount

175
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:30,080
of times I've seen an awful awful awful

176
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:31,670
work come out of those different stores

177
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,740
is ridiculous and great look to you

178
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:35,900
never go to guess where sir absolutely

179
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,010
absolutely but I think amount of time or

180
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,410
experience you've been doing something

181
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:41,090
does not equate to tell it whatsoever

182
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:42,830
yeah but it's never easy that so many

183
