00:00:15,369 --> 00:00:18,830
hi sisters James Charles here and

3
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,810
welcome back to my youtube channel

4
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:23,270
lately I've been travelling so much

5
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:24,650
doing so many fun and crazy things but

6
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:26,689
because of that I have not have time to

7
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:29,000
sit down and do a crazy makeup look in a

8
00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:30,140
long time I've gotten really great at

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,390
this point doing my everyday makeup

10
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:34,309
routine and this is a look right here

11
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:36,230
that I always go for it's very very

12
00:00:34,309 --> 00:00:37,910
similar to my normal glam just less of

13
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:40,489
each product and it's a lot more

14
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:42,980
simplistic I went with dewy skin fluffy

15
00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:45,500
brows light on the eyes simple liner and

16
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:46,820
lashes and of course a nude lip I also

17
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,320

00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,730

I was in Punta Cana with Rachel you guys

29
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:10,070
saw the vlog that I was in California

30
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:12,799
for a few weeks then I went to Maui or

31
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,970
Tottie's wedding it was so much fun now

32
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,350
I'm back home for just one week to

33
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:17,390
finish up high school then I'm finally

34
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:19,250
done thank God and I get to move and

35
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:22,040
let's start my career up in LA I am so

36
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:24,290
freaking excited but my skin is not

37
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,670
enjoying being back in the New York

38
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:27,440
weather I think I'm just like really

39
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:29,240
stressed out but I'm getting a pretty

40
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,810
bad break out and I'm really not too

41
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:33,080
happy about it

42
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:36,110
we're gonna conceal don't feel don't let

43
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:37,940
them know not today at least so glad to

44
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:39,920
be home as always I'm gonna probably

45
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:41,930
nose using my morphe r32 brush and my

46
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,490
mac studio finish concealer you guys

47
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:44,900
should know why I do this by now my nose

48
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:46,700
contour tends to do is slip and slide

49
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:48,409
around because my nose is super oily so

50
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,670
putting the extra layer on there

51
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:51,590
even on my everyday makeup routine

52
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:53,360
really helps everything to stay in place

53
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:54,979
the foundation I'm gonna grab my Make Up

54
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,750
For Ever Ultra HD stick in the shade at

55
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:58,760
Y at 315 and I'm just gonna start trying

56
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:00,890
that on my face I've been getting a lot

57
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,150
of comments lately saying like James you

58
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:03,979
use all the same products so you just

59
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:05,710
switch up and at first I was like [ __ ]

60
00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:07,729
this is my channel and then I was like

61
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:08,810
you're kind of right though and I

62
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:11,180
thought about it some more and I was

63
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:13,459
like you know what I am NOT someone who

64
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:15,680
does reviews I'm not someone who test

65
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:17,930
out new products very often I kind of do

66
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,660
a lot of crazy makeup books as you guys

67
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,300
know and I

68
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:23,070
hazily do simple glam like this I've

69
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,390
been traveling so much lately which is

70
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:26,910
why you guys have been seeing so much

71
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:27,960
simple super easy kind of boring on my

72
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:29,220
uncertain future because they haven't

73
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:32,190
had time release it then I do crazy

74
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:33,360
looks but I really like the products

75
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:35,250
that I work with and I tend to not

76
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,840
switch them up just because that's what

77
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,280
really works for me occasionally new

78
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,990
things always do make it into my routine

79
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,190
like brushes I shut up health and stuff

80
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:43,170
like that but for the most part my

81
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:44,430
babies remains the same because this is

82
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:45,840
what really works for my skin type I

83
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,820
have a pretty complicated skin I know

84
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,830
it'll look good every single time so I

85
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:51,240
tend to not switch it up very much sorry

86
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,560
there are plenty of other YouTube

87
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,750
channels out there in the world if you

88
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,010
want to look at some new products but I

89
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:59,240
get to find shape type concealer from

90
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:59,240
Tarte I'm going to highlight my face

91
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:10,950
anyways moving on I'm just blending this

92
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:12,030
in with my damp Beauty Blender then I'm

93
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,860
going to drive just a tiny bit of the

94
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:16,170
Kat Von D while concealer and just make

95
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,910
a few dots under my eyes and in the side

96
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:19,650
of my forehead same place I put the

97
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,790
concealers obviously not using as much

98
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:23,850
as this because we don't want to look

99
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:25,110
too pale but I'm pretty pasty already so

100
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:27,000
I like to add as much contrast to my

101
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:28,590
face as possible if you are new

102
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,930

00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,640
they keep story okay it's going to

120
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:01,530

00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:48,479
cannot wait this brush is actually so

146
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,009
good for contouring and bronzy I'm kind

147
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,840
of shook right now it's much more dense

148
00:04:50,009 --> 00:04:53,729
than I'm used to but it puts in the

149
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,070
color like really really nicely what is

150
00:04:53,729 --> 00:04:57,270
the name of this oh it doesn't have a

151
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:58,830
name okay maybe you actually have to buy

152
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:00,419
the entire set together either I

153
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:02,699
remember you can always use code James

00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:04,440
for 10% of all products at morphe y'all

155
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:06,360

157
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,990
maybe 180 brush to contour my nose I'm

158
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,180
still gonna sum it down using the middle

159
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:13,380
shade off the pallet like always but I'm

160
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:15,690
not gonna go as heavy as normal just

161
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:19,800
because this is everyday makeup and not

162
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:21,780

start off by kind of sketching in the

184
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:06,360
tail because my brow kind of stops

185
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:10,159
abruptly here and I want to make sure

186
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,159
there's at least some divine

187
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:18,860
and that's kind of the only thing I

188
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:19,790
really like to find so after that I'm

189
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,320
just going to go through and I'm going

190
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:23,479
to create a little hair like strokes

191
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,250
just to kind of build up that shape a

192
00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:33,590
little bit in any areas that are more

193
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:35,270
sparse then if there's ever area where I

194
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:36,530
like to heavier made a mistake I'll just

195
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,790
go on with the spoolie on the other end

196
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:39,440
and I'll kind of just brush through that

197
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:42,199
to kind of erase and blend it in a

198
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,910
little bit as you guys can see this is

199
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:45,740
much later than my normal pretty heavy

200
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:47,360
brows and it also is a lot quicker so

201
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,100
this is just a routine you like to do

202
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,350
I'm next enter grab just a little bit of

203
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:53,000
my ape tape concealer on my morphe 49m

204
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:55,520
begin to its sketch out underneath that

205
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,930
brow I left a little bit of a sparse

206
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,940
area right up in here so I'm just gonna

207
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:02,570
add a few more little alliance with that

208
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:03,470
benefit pencil and then to finish off

209
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:05,000
the brows I'm gonna go to the Maya

210
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:06,440
benefit gimme brow gel in the shade

211
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,570
number five and just brush those hairs

212
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:10,789
upwards to kind of create that bushy but

213
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:12,050
still natural brow effect now you guys

214
00:07:10,789 --> 00:07:13,729
could totally stop here if you wanted to

215
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:15,380
pop on your favorite mascara highlighter

216
00:07:13,729 --> 00:07:17,389
and some chapstick and just walk out the

217
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:19,340
door but you guys know me even for my

218
00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:21,590
everyday glam I still got to be a little

219
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:23,630
bit extra so for my eyes today I'm using

220
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:24,830
the brand new limited edition of morphia

221
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:26,510
bronze mocha Paola

222
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:28,550
I'm her - of this did already sell out

223
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:29,599
unfortunately but a lot of you guys have

224
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:31,160
been messaging me asked me to do a

225
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,740
tutorial on this so I'm going to use it

226
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:35,300
today if you don't have this the 35k

227
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,639
also from morphe is a wonderful

228
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,169
alternative with similar shades first

229
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:41,090
I'm gonna have this neutral toned orange

230
00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:47,150
shade on my m4 for one and use that in

231
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:49,099
my crease as a transition shade and then

232
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:51,530
on an m4 33 I'm going to grab this cool

233
00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:53,449
toned brown shade to it below the orange

234
00:07:51,530 --> 00:08:00,650
we use before and I'm going to deepen up

235
00:07:53,449 --> 00:08:02,419
the outer V and then if I am 514 I'm

236
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:04,220
going to go out this dark brown shade or

237
00:08:02,419 --> 00:08:06,710
right in the bottom row and I'm going to

238
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:11,460
deepen out a little bit more

239
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:11,460
[Music]

240
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:15,570
and I'm not gonna grab my m4 for one

241
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:17,070
that I started off with and just go over

242
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:22,500
these shades make sure they are nice and

243
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:24,630
blended out I'm gonna add a quick way

244
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:34,530
using my la girl line our matte liquid

245
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:36,630
liner oh my god I have a huge pimple

246
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:38,220
over the top of my wings usually end so

247
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:41,250
this is making things very very

248
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:44,520
challenging today and this la girl liner

249
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:47,300
is sucking for me I don't even know how

250
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,300
I'm going to address this situation

251
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:55,110
anyway essentially not that deep I need

252
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:56,490
to go to bed soon because I have school

253
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:59,070
tomorrow so I'm just gonna move on with

254
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:00,570
lower lashline I wonder got my m4 33 and

255
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:03,900
the same orange shade from before insert

256
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:06,000
that lower transition shade and grab me

257
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:07,320
the medium brown once again on my m5 14

258
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:14,730
I'm gonna blend and darken the outer

259
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:16,110
corner and then with my two 13 and they

260
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:17,820
dark brown shade that I use from before

261
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:25,410
I'm going to really lightly hug the

262
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:26,910
lower lash line and the last I'm gonna

263
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:28,470
use my OCC pencil in the shade of

264
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:30,330
feather to open up my eyes to make them

265
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:31,380
look super bright you know those days

266
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:32,460
are you like doing your makeup and

267
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,800
literally everything is going wrong

268
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:36,750
that's what's happening to me right now

269
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,490
my liner got messed up then I try to

270
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,780
line my upper waterline and my contact

271
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:41,340
got black on it and then I had to take

272
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:43,560
it out then I was crying then I had to

273
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:45,180
wait my foundation off it has been a

274
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:47,310
night to say the least

275
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:50,160
but I pulled everything back together

276
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:51,300
wiped my tears put on some translucent

277
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,620
powder and we're gonna keep moving on

278
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,780
because I don't have the energy to

279
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:58,220
refill this video or mascara today I'm

280
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:58,220
gonna be using my benefit roller lash

281
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:06,839
last today I'm gonna pop on my new phase

282
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:09,029
the house of lashes ikonics

283
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:10,649
if you would stop earlier on and didn't

284
00:10:09,029 --> 00:10:12,000
do eyeshadow or liner but still want a

285
00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:13,949
little bit of drama with your lashes I

286
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,600
would totally recommend the Lily lashes

287
00:10:13,949 --> 00:10:17,730
in the style of Miami there another one

288
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,560
of my absolute fave shocking would have

289
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:22,079
an issue an inner corner wants to fly up

290
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,250
can one thing go right today one thing

291
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:33,480

one thing god oh my god oh my god oh my

293
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,750

that I am this excited about an eyelash

295
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,870
go out on the first try I should just

296
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:42,269
put you into your perspective how crappy

297
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:43,680
this makeup day has been so far so line

298
00:10:42,269 --> 00:10:45,060
the upper waterline again since I

299
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,800
already cried it all off I'm going to

300
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:54,269

00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:19,680
skin since this is everyday glam I feel

310
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,660
like we need to make up what we were

311
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,180
lacking in eyeshadow lips all the fancy

312
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:25,560

313
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:28,170

makeup that I know will look good every

351
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,959
single time you know for the amount of

352
00:12:54,029 --> 00:12:56,459
