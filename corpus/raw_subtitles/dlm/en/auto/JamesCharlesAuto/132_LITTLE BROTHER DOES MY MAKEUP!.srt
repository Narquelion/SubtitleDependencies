probably Gosling for every single drawer

66
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:39,349
this is why ya know what foundation is

67
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:44,549
that born this way to face a good choice

68
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:54,630
no yeah sure

69
00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:56,849
anti-age Christy yes there's an urban

70
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:58,080
decay chill I think it says she's a good

71
00:02:56,849 --> 00:03:05,690
one again you're actually doing a pretty

72
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:07,549
good job so heart-shaped ape blur stick

73
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:09,510
sounds cool

74
00:03:07,549 --> 00:03:16,280
what kind of look are you going for us

75
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:16,280
today well I mean I wanted to look good

76
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:22,500
what is this wrong I don't know

77
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:27,810
oh highlighting powder what I thought

78
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:33,720
that was Jeffrey star is he's popular I

79
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:38,840
think James's favorite oh excuse me

80
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:42,690
you know Glee caller wait Ian open it up

81
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:45,180
I have ready you know what that is

82
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:46,590
yes sister Kane just picked out all of

83
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,269
his makeup products and I swear to god I

84
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:49,950
actually gave him no help at all

85
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:51,269
and he actually managed to pick out a

86
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:53,700
lot of parts that he used on an everyday

87
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:56,160
basis so I'm thinking he actually may be

88
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:58,190
a sister of himself a James Charles

89
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:00,090
video watcher and I think he's lying but

90
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:01,440
let's go ahead and get started do you

91
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:07,250

00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:17,020
the direction there's something oh that

95
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:19,260
doesn't have any directions I guess

96
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:23,500
doesn't work

97
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:28,270

101
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:35,440
tweeted you guys asking for some

102
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:37,270
questions but me and Ian can answer

103
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,340
throughout the process of this video so

104
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:40,630

your best memory of each other let's go

158
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:30,880
with the ugly green if you're admitting

159
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,860
that it's ugly why are you putting it on

160
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,780
as you look ugly with it

161
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:38,680
Caroline said what's the last thing that

162
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:40,450
you fought about filming this video Jake

163
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,130
asked who was the worst troublemaker as

164
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:43,910
you guys know I'm very much like a rule

165
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:46,050

the rules and try hard to like stay in

168
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:53,400
line Eaton was very much the opposite so

169
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:57,900
you definitely got in trouble more often

170
00:07:53,400 --> 00:08:00,240

oh I guess sure it's kind of fun but

176
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:14,460
kind of annoying at the same time why

177
00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:15,169
about 15 I haven't done anything with my

178
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:24,210
