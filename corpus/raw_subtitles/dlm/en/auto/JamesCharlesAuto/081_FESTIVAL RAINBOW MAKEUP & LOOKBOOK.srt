00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,149

00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:06,690

4
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,490
white ball background makeup studio

5
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:09,960
because today I am here in Coachella

6
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,429
Valley in California because it is

7
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,080

friends got sisters VIP passes it's

10
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,930
hashtag lit anyway I wish I did not just

11
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,880
say that but for today's video I wanted

12
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:23,070
to do a fun festival inspired makeup

13
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,449
tutorial I want to do a rainbow look

14
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,800
it's been a hot minute since I've

15
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:27,300
actually played with color and a few

16
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,560
weeks ago I posted a rainbow eye picture

17
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,420
on my Instagram and it's out of my

18
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,040
all-time at most like photos so thank

19
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,430
you and sisters for always killing of

20
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,989
the game and then also I did maybe go

21
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,489
and buff and beyond with my Coachella

22
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:40,680
Alpha it's like your guys's wigs are

23
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:41,640
about to be snatched at this point when

24
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,110
seeing this video you guys have already

25
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,550
probably seen them over on my Instagram

26
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,079
but at the end of the video as well I

27
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:47,370
want to do a little fun at Coachella

28
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:54,000
lookbook so I hope you guys are excited

29
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:55,739
and let's get on the video I'm first

30
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,420
gonna talk with using a good sunscreen

31
00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:01,109
this is the touch-up pore perfecting

32
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,100
silk'n sunscreen hello SPF 35 we are

33
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:04,409
obviously in the middle of the desert

34
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,299
and it is really ridiculously hot here

35
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:07,530
and the Sun is intense so it's really

36
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:08,820
important that you protect your skin

37
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,380
even when you're putting a full face of

38
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,330
makeup on it can definitely penetrate

39
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,770
all the way through and I rather be safe

40
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,630
than sorry I'm also gonna use my

41
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:18,150
all-time babe the touch out water cream

42
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:20,009
moisturizer I love this thing it's

43
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,869
literally so good like Hello it just

44
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:23,970
makes my skin it's so soft and smooth

45
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:25,229
and the air out here is ridiculously dry

46
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,189
like I said we're in the middle of a

47
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:28,080
desert so I really want to make sure

48
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:29,970
that my skin is hydrated and doesn't get

49
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,079
the air sucked out of it and last but

50
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:33,090
not least first skin prep I'm gonna go

51
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:35,400
to the touch-ups cell canvas you guys

52
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,780
know I'm really not a big fan of primers

53
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,119
but this one for some reason it's just

54
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,460
really really bomb it fills in the pores

55
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,869
and honestly makes my skin so so so

56
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,520
smooth and with the amount of dust

57
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:46,110
that's gonna be flying around in the air

58
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,390
at this festival I really want to make

59
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,890
sure for once my pores are filled so

60
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:50,790
they can't get clogged and other stuff

61
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,890
if that makes sense

62
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,090
skincare 101 with sister James /

63
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,649
foundation said I'm gonna go to the Too

64
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,149
Faced Born This Way Foundation you guys

65
00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:00,119
know this is my all-time a favor and a

66
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:01,710
fun fact actually last year at Coachella

67
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:03,540
was the first time I ever tried this

68
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:05,850
foundation and I literally have fall in

69
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,439
love with it and used it ever since

70
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,789
and thank you doing friend hay-zu's for

71
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,200
showing it to me it's actually so cool

72
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:12,540
because a lot of my friends have changed

73
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,830
a lot this past year but my best friends

74
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,510
have all remained exactly this

75
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,980
and last year Coachella it was me and

76
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,300
Laura and Victor and Marcos and his

77
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,070
girlfriend Brittany and then hay-zu's

78
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,900
and we just got crunk and partied the

79
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:23,610
entire time sober of course but now

80
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,470
we're all back here together and it's

81
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,000
just such an amazing amazing group of

82
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,300
friends that I am so blessed to have in

83
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,220
my life

84
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,840
I'm literally pray that this foundation

85
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,700
color is going to match me when I take

86
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,260
photos later on today I did just get

87
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,970
spray tans literally the darkest I've

88
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,440
ever been and I was hoping that it was

89
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:39,270
gonna wash off a lot in my shower this

90
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,380
morning and it did it but you know what

91
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:42,330
we're just going for that bronzy

92
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,860
Coachella type of look I'm really really

93
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,090
hoping that this foundation matches it's

94
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,380
kind of hard to tell because we are an

95
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:48,060
outside lighting which I'm definitely

96
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,470
not used to but we're gonna make it work

97
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,880
it's actually so crazy to think about

98
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,110
because I'm pretty sure when I went to

99
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,820
Coachella last year with Laura and all

100
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:56,190
the sisters that my Instagram was just

101
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,780
over 1 million followers like you're

102
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:59,850
literally kidding me and we just hit 4

103
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,890
million a few days ago like that is so

104
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:03,240
beyond insane to me I was looking

105
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,620
through all the photos from last year

106
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,030
and just reminiscing and I'm just so

107
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,860
excited to be here again I really really

108
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:09,780
do love music festivals and obviously

109
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,700
you guys know music plays a huge part in

110
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,900
my life and I'm just so excited to just

111
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,670
listen to some really really dope music

112
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,500
have some really amazing outfits and

113
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:18,090
just see a ton of friends and a bunch of

114
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,870
you guys as well I think there's gonna

115
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:20,730
be a full-on

116
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:22,739
sister be angry I like taking over

117
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,100
Coachella but I am so beyond ready for

118
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:24,450
it

119
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:27,090
the air here is literally so dry

120
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:28,890
concealers already drying down oh my god

121
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:30,269
I'm scared but you took one this so fast

122
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:32,280
oh there's B there's a B there's B oh

123
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:33,390
it's a fly I don't know I've never

124
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,340
actually talked about this on camera

125
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:36,870
before but I am like literally deathly

126
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,489
afraid of bees for some reason I've

127
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:40,080
never been stung don't even know if I'm

128
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:41,250
allergic I just hate that with all my

129
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,600
heart I'm gonna blend out this concealer

130
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,340
underneath my eyes and then literally

131
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,769
hover my setting powder like right at

132
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,810
the ready I'm so scared at how dry this

133
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:50,790
weather is and how fast everything is

134
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,989
drying down which means if we don't set

135
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:53,880
this fast enough we're gonna get sister

136
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:55,230
creases and all the wrong places all day

137
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,030
long for the remainder my face I'm gonna

138
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:58,980
grab a really dense powder puff and

139
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:01,320
really pack it into the powder and Pat

140
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:03,120
this on it has been a hot minute since

141
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,739
I've like really a baked and powdered my

142
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,209

143
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:08,190
hot and sweaty today the Sun is like

a sister Louie Vuitton bandana and that

152
00:04:19,229 --> 00:04:22,860
was way too expensive to have a

153
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:24,360
foundation encrusted and dusted all over

154
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:26,010

probably looking the worst oh that's a

184
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:21,990
little harsh oh I'm actually really

185
00:05:20,669 --> 00:05:23,759
happy with how the base is looking right

186
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:25,169

187
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,490

00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,520
knowing about her once

212
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:10,439
yeah rollerskating she was literally so

213
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,029
sweet she was with her two nieces and

214
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:13,649
they were sisters so hey it says his

215
00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:14,669
nieces if you guys are watching and she

216
00:06:13,649 --> 00:06:16,529
was just so nice literally the entire

217
00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:17,939
time she was like interacting with

218
00:06:16,529 --> 00:06:18,120
different people at the roller skating

219
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:19,620
rink

220
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,089
this acting like a normal person which

221
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,050
was just like really really dope to see

222
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,339
because she's one of the biggest people

223
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:27,839
in the world right now she's so talented

224
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:29,759
like hello I'm a sister says a stand to

225
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,050
see her perform today I'm gonna bake

226
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,279
myself in the oven for a few minutes I

227
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:33,659
guess just by standing out on the Sun

228
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:34,830
because literally thought is like the

229
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:36,599
heat temperature we're dealing with

230
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:37,860
right now at home do my brows off-camera

231
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:38,710
quickly I'll be right back to start off

232
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,640
the eye makeup

233
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:41,170
let's go ahead and jump right into this

234
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,300
rainbow I look and of course that i'll

235
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:44,830
be using the morphe at 35 be Pella this

236
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,300
is my all-time favorite I already went

237
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:47,560
ahead and started up writing my eyelids

238
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,700
and instead of using a translucent

239
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,080
powder I actually use the white

240
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,820
eyeshadow here so hopefully that'll make

241
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,960
all the colors a little bit brighter I'm

242
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,730
gonna grab a fluffy brush and dip into

243
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,920
the yellow shade first and pop that

244
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:58,120
right in the inner corners normally you

245
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,710
guys know I'd like to start off kind of

246
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,240
light and then blend in it but for these

247
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,680
type of looks I'm really gonna pack the

248
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,210
colors in there and then blend them in

249
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,680
after because I really want the colors

250
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:07,000
to be as pegmatite as possible next

251
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,590
gonna grab a fluffy blending brush into

252
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,260
the orange shade impact that right in

253
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:13,090
the center on the crease well take kind

254
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:14,380
of placing that color on there and then

255
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:15,730
blending it out I think you should have

256
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,110
really focuses pigment right in the

257
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:18,820
crease because I am going to cut it

258
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:20,320
today and then just use the excess

259
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:22,840
shadow left on the brush to blend it

260
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:24,760
upwards into this region and also

261
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,990
slightly into the color next to it after

262
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,640
I finished each color I'm gonna go back

263
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:28,960
into the previous color with the same

264
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,760
exact brush and make sure that they're

265
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,860
evenly blended together right in that

266
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:34,240
transitional region next under grab one

267
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,440
last faulty blending brush in the bright

268
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,060
red shade in the palette and I'm going

269
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,860
to finish off that I look and I'm

270
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:40,330
actually gonna pull the shadow white out

271
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:43,690
into the classic v-shape that you guys

272
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:45,280
know I live before wasn't owl hooting

273
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:47,020
right now it's like 2:00 p.m. all right

274
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,300
I was nocturnal they're awake and let

275
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:50,920
ready to go I'm also gonna pop the same

276
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,990
exact colors in the same order on my

277
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:54,310
lower lashline as well what I did this

278
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:56,590
look originally I went with a very very

279
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:58,060
bright look but for today's look that I

280
00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:00,370
have planned I'm doing a very very like

281
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,720
ninja inspired type of dark and smoky

282
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:03,130
looks like I'm gonna using a whole lot

283
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,720
of black to really smoke this out and

284
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:06,490
make the colors really really intense

285
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,470
I'm gonna go ahead and line my lower and

286
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:11,080
upper water lines that I using the

287
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:12,880
Maybelline lasting drama waterproof

288
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,350
pencil I just picked this one up super

289
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,970
quickly at a store I forgot mine at home

290
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:17,530
love that of course sister James is

291
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:19,300
forgetting everything are we surprised

292
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:21,220
we really shouldn't be you guys know I

293
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,900
absolutely hate doing this but I feel

294
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:24,100
like it is very very vital for the type

295
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,090
of look that we're going forward today

296
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,560
oh well that's dark and it's gonna

297
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:28,480
really highlight my eyes if you guys

298
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,730
notice as well it has been a hot minute

299
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:32,200
since I've worn my grey contacts in a

300
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:33,400
video but I feel like they're

301
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,990
appropriate for today's look I'm gonna

302
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:38,800
grab a small flat pocket brush this is

303
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:40,450
the Sigma e 20s and very very carefully

304
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,370
at up off the excess and then blend this

305
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:43,810
right into the lower lash line

306
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:44,980
okay need way more than that or the

307
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:46,660
outer V region to actually want the

308
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:48,340
block to be really really defined this

309
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,630
is a really really good and thick

310
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:51,340
cardboard so I'm gonna do is actually

311
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:52,510
rip this and this is a technique that a

312
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:54,220
lot of different drag queen

313
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:56,620
and I'm actually going to hold this

314
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:58,060
cardboard onto my eye I don't know how

315
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,560
to do this here Bob could you friend who

316
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:01,180
hold your handheld mirror for you that's

317
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:03,550
a legit sister right there okay I'm

318
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:05,140
gonna place this card right on the

319
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:07,090
corner of my eye I'm placing the shade

320
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:08,500
on here in the shape of kind of like a

321
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:10,360
winged liner and then I'm of course

322
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,950
going to blend it out by having this

323
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,230
cardboard there and really pressing it

324
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:15,970
onto the face you're gonna get a really

325
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:17,440
really clean line when I take this off

326
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:19,060
we're just gonna make it so much easier

327
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,770
because you guys know if with a little

328
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:22,570
bit too much black your look can go from

329
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:24,520
really really beautiful to really really

330
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:27,040
muddy and spooky real real fast if

331
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:32,110
you're not careful oh wow I really

332
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:33,460
thought I had it there I'm scared I'm

333
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:34,930
gonna have another smaller fluffy brush

334
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:37,000
and some more black shadow and attempt

335
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:38,560
to blend out this outer corner it's

336
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
looking a little bit spooky totally I

337
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,410
don't know how to take my own advice and

338
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,480
the situation and I'm gonna pull this

339
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:44,890
really lightly into the crease right

340
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,690
before we get ready to cut it this is

341
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:49,000
looking spooky I was really confident

342
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:51,040
this time I'm not as confident that on

343
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,990
this side of the yard there's little old

344
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,910
me filming a rainbow makeup tutorial and

345
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:56,230
on that side of the yard Laura's husband

346
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:57,640
and her brother are having a drinking

347
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:58,600
competition to see who can drink a can

348
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,040
of beer faster

349
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,390
I love Coachella okay I think I'm

350
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,670
actually kind of happy with how this is

351
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:05,230
turning out maybe it's lightly I'm just

352
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,640
basically going in a back-and-forth with

353
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:08,080
both black and the different colors that

354
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,480
I'm using to really create the eye shape

355
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:12,550
that I'm trying to go for today it's

356
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,200
really hard to blend black seamlessly

357
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:15,730
into other colors especially ones that

358
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,530
are bright like orange and yellow and

359
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:19,900
create a seamless transition but I feel

360
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:21,010
like we did a pretty decent job now that

361
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,060
I have the basic eye all complete I'm

362
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:24,190
gonna take a really really light

363
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:25,960
concealer this is the k'kaw beauty one

364
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:28,540
put it on the back of my hand and I'm

365
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:30,430
going to cut my crease using a mac 242

366
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,570
brush and before that can see that even

367
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,830
dries down I'm gonna go ahead and grab

368
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:34,810
the in your dreams

369
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:36,040
iridescent angel cosmetic glitter impact

370
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:38,110
that right over top of the lid for a

371
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:41,590
nice pop oh my god that is so pretty

372
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:42,910
oh you're kidding hello okay now I'm

373
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:44,170
actually loving how this is looking so

374
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,820
this took a nice turn for the better

375
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:46,870
for once now that we have the glitter

376
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,250
all place on though I'm gonna grab that

377
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:50,140
fluffy brush that had a black on it and

378
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:51,430
kind of blend out this outer V if so

379
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:53,350
there's an even transition between the

380
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:55,060
glitter and the black and I'm gonna kind

381
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:57,430
of pull this into the lash line as well

382
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:58,900
so it creates like a more rounded cut

383
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:00,430
crease type of shape I forgot glitter

384
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,840
glue on this shape which is classic me

385
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:03,400
so I'm gonna grab a little bit of lash

386
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,900
glue and dab it on the back of my hand

387
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,840
and try to like I don't even know how

388
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:09,160
I'm gonna

389
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:11,080
that's rude I'm gonna get the Tom Ford

390
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:13,150
liner as well into a fan up black line

391
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,770
along by a flashlight just for some more

392
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:16,000
dimension I'm gonna grab that flat

393
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:17,650
smudging brush that we used on the lower

394
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,090
lash in as well dive into a little bit

395
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:20,710
of block and then go right over that

396
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:23,260
liner that we just put on there so it's

397
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:24,670
kind of a more smudge liner type of love

398
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:26,140
all right guys and that is one eye off

399
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:28,630
complete obviously we still have lashes

400
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:30,400
to do but that took me a hot minute so

401
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:31,870
I'm gonna call the cameras quickly relax

402
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,130
in the shader for a little bit so I'm

403
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:35,050
not burning and do the other eye

404
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:36,310
off-camera of course at the green blue

405
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:37,690
and then purple and I'll be right back

406
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:39,250
to finish off the rest of the love all

407
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:40,600
right case about one hour later now

408
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,770
literally Coachella's gonna be over by

409
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,630
the time I'm done with my makeup today

410
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:45,310
but I just finished both eyes I deftly

411
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:46,570
was not loving them at first but I think

412
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:48,010
they definitely turned out pretty decent

413
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:49,540
and of course we have sister face soon

414
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:51,160
to save the day so I'm gonna play a

415
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:53,950
light coat of the Mac extended play

416
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:55,240
mascara to prep for lashes I'm gonna

417
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:56,950
make sure to get those really really

418
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,570
evenly coated as well because you guys

419
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:00,220
know I don't really do what black smokey

420
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:01,330
looks very often but when I do to them

421
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,100
it's really important that you get a

422
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:04,630
good coat of mascara so that there's no

423
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:06,250
light spots and everything blends really

424
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:07,390
really well together and then for lashes

425
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,890
today I'm gonna pop on a pair of Lillie

426
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:11,290
lashes Miami's you guys know these are

427
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:13,210
my all-time faves and wispy I did not

428
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:15,070
spend an hour on each eye look today to

429
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:16,540
get them covered up by a big lashes so

430
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:18,850
these be the perfect solution I'm gonna

431
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:20,530
pop this right on the exact center of

432
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:23,230
the eyelid and really make sure to pull

433
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:24,970
that ending upwards because we did do a

434
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:26,200
v-shape with this eye shadow look today

435
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:28,450
and I want to make sure that the eyelash

436
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,620
follows suit and doesn't look droopy

437
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:31,390
because you really want the eyes to look

438
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:33,310
kind of a port and snatched oh yeah

439
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:35,410

440
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:36,820

441
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:38,650
