00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,570
hi sisters James Charles here and

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:05,130
welcome back to my youtube channel for

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:07,379
today's that I have a super super fun

4
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,940
makeup challenge plan for a lovely video

5
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:11,010
I got ready in the complete pitch-black

6
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,410
darkness which was so intense

7
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,519
the results were spooky Diddley's if you

8
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,109
guys have not checked out last week's

9
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:17,820
video be sure to click right up here and

10
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:19,109
go check it out but I had so much fun

11
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,760
doing and I really don't do makeup

12
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:22,890
challenges that often so I wanted to do

13
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,210
another one today mostly because I'm

14
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,160
running out of video ideas but I thought

15
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,090
it'd be very very fun and this is one

16
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,849
challenge you guys have been requesting

17
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:31,830
for so long it is always one of the top

18
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:34,710
comments on my videos this challenge

19
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:37,800
breaks all laws of makeup and that is

20
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:39,480
doing my makeup backwards all makeup

21
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,610
lovers both professional artists and

22
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,440
average makeup wears how about we like

23
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,730
to call a makeup routine I personally

24
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,489
like to start off with my face then

25
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:49,079
eyebrows and eyes then lashes that lips

26
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:50,730
then finishing touches that I don't like

27
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:52,020
to do a different routine some people

28
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,550
start with their eyebrows some people

29
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,469
start with their eyes don't even ask me

30
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,210
how they do that but obviously the end

31
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:59,219
goal no matter where you start is to

32
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,539
look beautiful and confident for today's

33
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:02,399
video I'm gonna only make up knowledge

34
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:04,320
upside down and do a makeup routine

35
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,360
backwards starting with settings for it

36
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,100
and then finishing off with foundation

37
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,270
which is normally my first thing I think

38
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,159
you guys get the point at this point

39
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,540
this should be intense I don't know who

40
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,610
the originator heir so I don't know who

41
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,960
to give credit to but I know both Dante

42
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,040
and Michael think I've done an please go

43
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,600
check out the videos they're absolutely

44
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,430
amazing content creators I love them

45
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,360
both but everyone who has done this has

46
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,220
been using it through normal makeup

47
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,450
products in the opposite order for me

48
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,790
I'm gonna do everything in the opposite

49
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,140
order but I did switch out a few

50
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,299
products that I knew would really really

51
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,400
mess everything up because I do want to

52
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:34,290
try to make this the best-looking result

53
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,759
possible even while still doing it

54
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,650
backwards you guys know what I mean

55
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,540
long story short I am so excited for

56
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,280
this so without further ado if you'd

57
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,030
like to see my makeup routine completely

58
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,980
backwards

59
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:47,129
let's get started

60
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,129
[Music]

61
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:51,229
alright sister so I'm starting all this

62
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:53,420
up today by going in with my morphia

63
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:56,270
prep and set settings right and I'm just

64
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:58,400
going to mist my entire face as a base

65
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:00,170
to this makeup obviously this would

66
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:04,040
normally be my last step but since is

67
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:05,840
the prep and sat hopefully this will

68
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,220
still work if you know what I'm saying

69
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,420
second to last didn't wake up or two you

70
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:10,670
guys know I usually finished off my

71
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:12,320
looks with a liquid lipstick for today's

72
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:14,209
video I'm gonna use the Anastacio liquid

73
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,380
lipstick in the shade Archon I really

74
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:16,640
really love the shade and I think it'll

75
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,930
match really really well with the look

76
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,250
that I have planned fingers crossed that

77
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,930
the eyes go out certainly we have no

78
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:22,160
idea what it's gonna look like I am a

79
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:23,810
little bit worried about this though

80
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,550
because while I love the anasazi look of

81
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,650
lipsticks and all of their colors they

82
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:29,180
are a little bit drying so hopefully

83
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:30,410
throughout this entire video and throw

84
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:33,140
out the talking they don't get like

85
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:37,670
crusted Sahara desert status at the end

86
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:38,989
we'll see this looks so strange hello

87
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:41,480
before lifts I'm usually finishing off

88
00:02:38,989 --> 00:02:42,980
my eyes with lashes and mascara normally

89
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,360
likes to do a lashes and then blend them

90
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,380
together with the mascara because I

91
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,200
personally have a really really hard

92
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:49,610
time at putting on lashes but for

93
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,400
today's video we have to do mascara

94
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:53,959
first about Masha so lord help me in

95
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,110

96
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:58,040
gia Gunn wonky law situation but for

97
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,680
today's video i'm gonna be using the

98
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:02,480

so next obviously comes lashes and for

113
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,459
today's video of course I'm going to use

114
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:30,079
my Lily lashes and Miami's these are my

115
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:31,430
all-time favorite lashes and I also just

00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:33,019
recently found out you can use KO James

117
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:34,040
for 10% off of these I know some of you

118
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:35,750

00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,530
even know that existed so hey if you

120
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,510

121
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:41,420
favorite lashes coat James gets the

00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:42,430
money off you're welcome okay second

123
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:44,660
time's the charm

124
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,410
she's on there I think the one thing

125
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,930
that's really good about this challenge

126
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:49,340
is that my eyeliner is got to come after

127
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:51,950
my lashes so I get to hide all the

128
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:53,180
mistakes that I just made woo before

129
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:53,930
doing my lashes I normally line my

130
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,010
waterline

131
00:03:53,930 --> 00:04:01,819
I'm gonna do that using the pretty

132
00:03:55,010 --> 00:04:03,170
vulgar new two liner and then comes

133
00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:04,400
lowered lashline shadow and for today's

134
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:06,260
look I'm gonna be using the chocolate

135
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,760
hell are some Apollo I guess we have to

136
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:09,709
go from darkest to lightest which is not

137
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,760
what I normally like to do but we're

138
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:12,439
gonna have to make it work I'm first

139
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,870
gonna grab an Emma 5:08 this is just a

140
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:17,509
tiny little blending brush and grab this

141
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:19,190
dark brown shade right in here and buff

142
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:20,780
this right up against the lash line I am

143
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:22,880
of course planning a wing too so I'm

144
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:24,650
just gonna pull this out slightly in the

145
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,060
outer corner to make sure that that's

146
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:27,860
blended together and there's no like

147
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,900
really awkward divide I'm next in to

148
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:32,360
grab my makeup shock t61 brush and dip

149
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:34,070
into this ready shade right here and use

150
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,240
that to buff out the brown I'm placing

151
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:37,280
that right below I'm making sure that

152
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,720
there's no harsh edges really using that

153
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,680
to diffuse out the brown because we did

154
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,150
not want it to look like we just got

155
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,919
punched in the eye

156
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:44,419
but of course leaving room because we

157
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:46,220
don't wanna pull it too far down finally

158
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:48,530
I'm gonna go over Smith 247 brush and

159
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,759
dip into this bright orange and this

160
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:51,470
kind of mac and cheese shade right here

161
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:55,669
mixed together and then just buff that

162
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:57,289
out so far actually not that bad moving

163
00:04:55,669 --> 00:04:59,150
on to my upper lid at my last of my eye

164
00:04:57,289 --> 00:05:01,130
looks is always eyeliner if I'm wearing

165
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:02,449
it and for today's look yes it does

166
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:04,490
include eyeliner so I'm gonna turn up

167
00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:06,169
the Tom Ford Island our pen and attempt

168
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:13,419
to sketch out a way over top of my

169
00:05:06,169 --> 00:05:13,419
lashes oh God

170
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:24,979
Hey did I just do it Oh when it comes to

171
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,970
this challenges you guys might like to

172
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:27,800
go big or go home

173
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:30,860
and normally next to be eyeshadow but

174
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,699
for this look I want to do I'm probably

175
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:35,539
gonna regret this

176
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:36,860
hey glitter cut crease so I got the BH

177
00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:39,979
Cosmetics glitters in the shades

178
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:42,169
sapphire and mermaid blue and also the

179
00:05:39,979 --> 00:05:44,060
violet boss glitter adhesive normally

180
00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:45,289
yes I would do this first then this but

181
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,780
let's be real these are never gonna

182
00:05:45,289 --> 00:05:49,039
stick so get over it it's not that deep

183
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,180
I'm just gonna ply these with the darker

184
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,860
blue in the outer corner I'm bringing

185
00:05:50,180 --> 00:06:02,120
into the teal and hopefully we'll be

186
00:05:51,860 --> 00:06:03,710
able to make this look really cute do

187
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,240
you see this hello look at how good that

188
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:06,710
crease sighs I feel like we might be

189
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,000
able to make this work to start off the

190
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,229
actual cut crease I'm gonna go back to

191
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,419
the light chocolate eyeshadow palette

192
00:06:09,229 --> 00:06:13,430
and my e39 brush and start off with this

193
00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:15,320
dark brown shade once again so much of

194
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:17,740
the lower lashline and go right above

195
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,740
that crease

196
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:24,900
okay interesting I'm not gonna get that

197
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,460
same I'm 508 brush from before and dip

198
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:29,400
into that same a bright red shade and

199
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:31,410
blend out that line if any of you guys

200
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,640
watching they're like oh gee sisters you

201
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:34,170
know that this is the technique I used

202
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,030
to use all the time for doing up cut

203
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:37,290
creases I have more recently actually

204
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:38,310
switching to the normal technique of

205
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:39,600
doing it when starting off with the

206
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:41,550
lightest shadow and then working way in

207
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,080
and then just cutting it but I used to

208
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,490
do all my cut creases by sketching out

209
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,650
the line first and then I'm blending

210
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:48,660
upwards so I think I may have the upper

211
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:51,000
hand in this but clearly it's not

212
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,320
looking too great so far so I don't know

213
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,670
I'm gonna really carefully blend that

214
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,410
out clearly she needs a little bit of

215
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:58,040
work using the bright orange paint from

216
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:58,040
before

217
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,660
I think I'm gonna grab that mac and

218
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,250
cheese hit from before and just go right

219
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,420
over those edges what's actually working

220
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,740
my favorite here is that since they

221
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:09,600
don't have an eyeshadow base on if

222
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,800
anything gets too intense I can just go

223
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,450
over with my blending brush and just

224
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,250
scrub really really hard and it'll

225
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:15,330
actually take off some of that product

226
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,980
since it doesn't have anything to really

227
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:18,060
stick to okay so that is what I all

228
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,800
complete obviously may still have some

229
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,090
work to do but I'm gonna go ahead and do

230
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,340
the other one off-camera in the same

231
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:25,320
exact order I promise and I'll be right

232
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,520
back all right now back about 30 minutes

233
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,230
later and that is the second eye all

234
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,730
complete and this should be proof that I

235
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:31,380
never cheat during challenges even off

236
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:32,940
camera because this eye is not looking

237
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,650
the best

238
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:37,200
so before eyes my makeup routine always

239
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:38,640
comes my eyebrows but I always fill them

240
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,460
in and then use my brow gel and then

241
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:43,530
clean them up since this is reverse I'm

242
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,790
gonna go out at some concealer and go

243
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:46,530
right under this and be super super

244
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:49,590
careful and not to overlap the eyeshadow

245
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:53,070
and then fill the man wish me luck

246
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:57,260
I have to try to imagine where I'm going

247
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:57,260
to actually fill in the eyebrow

248
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,709
[Music]

249
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:07,120
that looks about right maybe I'm gonna

250
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:10,810
grab a synthetic bullet brush this is

251
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,850
the e36 and buff that out being really

252
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:17,140
really careful to not mess up the

253
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:18,940
eyeshadow that I worked so hard on okay

254
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:21,430
honestly that doesn't even look that bad

255
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:24,070
but now I have no idea how we're gonna

256
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:27,540
fill these in without messing up I

257
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:29,530
really rely on that concealer afterwards

258
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:31,180
to fill my brows today I'm going to use

259
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:33,340
the iconic brow cushion in the shade

260
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:34,750
medium sister nikkietutorials introduced

261
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:36,070
me to this in our collab and I feel like

262
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,720
I'll be able to be really precise with

263
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:41,179
this at an angle brush since it is a

264
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:45,130
liquid of formula hopefully

265
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:47,960
[Music]

266
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:51,110
okay you know what a little bit dark but

267
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:52,760
I feel like we can work with bass okay

268
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:57,130
that is the other bra I'll complete once

269
00:08:52,760 --> 00:09:01,880
again not lying about this good brow a

270
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:03,470
brow let's move on so now that the lips

271
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,540
eyes and brows are all complete it is

272
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:06,680
time for the base makeup now it is so

273
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:09,050
weird too because a lot of people

274
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:11,450
actually start their base makeup with

275
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:13,070
eyes and brows already done but for me

276
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:15,620
that is something that is very very new

277
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:16,880
to me I don't do that like ever so this

278
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:18,800
is definitely gonna be a major major

279
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,030
challenge normally when it comes to my

280
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,220
base makeup you guys know that likes to

281
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:24,170
use my powder products but for today's

282
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,790
video like I said I do want to switch

283
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:26,900
out my products just a little bit to

284
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:30,260
really try my best to make this a

285
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:31,940
successful look so out of my basic of my

286
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:33,080
last step is always a highlighter so for

287
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:36,470
today I'm gonna use the brand new

288
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:38,270
married do manizer from the balm which

289
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:40,190
is a liquid highlight I'm gonna put this

290
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:43,550
right in the same places as my normal oh

291
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:45,110
wow that's really pretty

292
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:49,510
okay I'm gonna put this into normal

293
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:49,510
pieces as all my highlights usually go

294
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,830
in the inner corners then I'm just gonna

295
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:59,780
take my damp Beauty Blender and I'm

296
00:09:54,830 --> 00:10:02,500
going to blend it right out oh you're

297
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:05,960
kidding wow that's blinding though huh

298
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:07,490
love best whoa I definitely need to try

299
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,920
to sell again in a video where I'm not

300
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:11,120
like completely messing up my makeup so

301
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,010
before a highly obviously comes a

302
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,020
contour and normally I use my Kat Von D

303
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:16,280
shade Alam palette but like I said I'm

304
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,510
not gonna use powders because we

305
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,890
obviously have to do a foundation and

306
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:21,440
concealer later on and that just gets

307
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:23,990
really really messy so I'm Lee needs my

308
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,600
benefit hoola cream contouring stick

309
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:29,780
instead just gonna go right in all the

310
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:31,610
hollows of my face a little bit on the

311
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:34,220
forehead tell you know reduce that

312
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:37,250
hairline because lord knows sister needs

313
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:41,240
it on the jaw line to really snatch her

314
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:43,190
up and then also right down the bridge

315
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,960
of the nose you guys for this video I

316
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:46,860
definitely do not think we're gonna have

317
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:49,140
a snatched nose and I am

318
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:50,190
very sad about it then once again just

319
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:59,220
gonna take my damp Beauty Blender and

320
00:10:50,190 --> 00:11:03,570
buff that right in oh that is a little

321
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:04,620
orange well you're literally kidding me

322
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:06,630
I look like I was doing my makeup

323
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:08,220
outside on a really sunny day and only

324
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:10,230
did my eyes and my brows and then fell

325
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:12,810
asleep and woke up like seven hours

326
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:15,209
later with a sunburn what is going on no

327
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:16,860
this was so good okay say this what I

328
00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:18,420
hadn't grabbed my iconic London a cream

329
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:20,760
contour kit and I'm gonna go in it with

330
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:22,890
this shade right down here to both

331
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,660
darken up the contours but also cool

332
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:27,680
them down just a little bit because

333
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:29,820
clearly this is not what we want okay

334
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,970
yeah much better

335
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:33,630
a little intense but we can fix this we

336
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:37,040
got this in the bag

337
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:38,899
pretend that little meltdown ever happen

338
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,190
this is scary

339
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:43,200
so before contouring highlighting and

340
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:45,660
blush obviously comes concealer and at

341
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,480
the foundation but in between those is

342
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:49,980
the powder and if you guys are a makeup

343
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,899
lover you know that the number one rule

344
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:54,630
and makeup is that it's really really

345
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:57,209
just illegal like the police will come

346
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:59,760
after you if you put a cream product

347
00:11:57,209 --> 00:12:01,500
over powder it's just the formulas and

348
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,209
the texture and the chemistry behind it

349
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:06,510
just makes them not really work together

350
00:12:03,209 --> 00:12:08,520
but that's today's challenge we have to

351
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:10,290
do it now I'm just gonna use a light

352
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:12,480
amount of my Laura Mercier translucent

353
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:14,490
setting powder mix together my Too Faced

354
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,410
sweet peach powder on this one oh god my

355
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:21,360
damp Beauty Blender and dip right in and

356
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:24,360
just apply a really really really light

357
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,370
layer to the entire face to set it in

358
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:28,380
place and hopefully not to disrupt the

359
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:30,780
foundation

360
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:32,880
told you there are the police Mitchell

361
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:35,670
now so another face is all set in place

362
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,290
before that step comes concealer and of

363
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:39,480
course I'm using my guitar shape deep in

364
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:41,130
the shade light neutral and I'm actually

365
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,920
kind of happy that this step is coming

366
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:44,940
before foundation because I think I can

367
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,370
kind of use this to my advantage to

368
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:49,650
really carve out my mistakes being the

369
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:52,470
eyebrows of course the nose contour the

370
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:54,300
lips and the contour so everything is

371
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:56,010
like ready and more clean for the

372
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:58,290
foundation we could pull this together

373
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:59,490
let's see I'm of course gonna put this

374
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:04,770
right in the center of my forehead for

375
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:07,260
highlighting okay just cut that bra off

376
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:09,770
a little bit but you know what maybe

377
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,770
it's for the better

378
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:18,430
[Music]

379
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:18,820
well this is an interesting look to say

380
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,620
the least

381
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:23,290
yes thank God for beauty blenders

382
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:25,720
because they really do fix anything

383
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:27,700
my contour literally looks like Trixie

384
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:31,090
Mattel from RuPaul's Drag Race I'm

385
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:34,180
coming for you girl my god this kids is

386
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:37,930
why you did not put creams or liquid

387
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:41,800
over powder because once that is set in

388
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:50,020
place whenever you put over top will not

389
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:52,360
blend oh no oh this needs to blend out

390
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,900
oh my lord I cannot have this contour of

391
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,060
my own right now

392
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:58,120
so my base has gone from nothing and

393
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:59,470
very very pimply inbred - way to orange

394
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,720
- way too dark

395
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:03,970
- now way too light and still very

396
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:06,370
uneven so obviously the next step and

397
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:07,960
last step is going to be foundation

398
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:08,980
normally you guys know I use the Too

399
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,420
Faced for other things just like my

400
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:13,240
all-time favorite hold it girl

401
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:15,490
foundation it is so so so good but I

402
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:17,230
will say for my skin type it is a

403
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:19,420
hydrating foundation that does not dry

404
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:21,400
down and since this is the last step and

405
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:23,830
I do not have powder to modify and save

406
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:25,839
the day I'm gonna go with the LA girl

407
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:28,570
Pro matte new foundation in the shade

408
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,950
stand these just launched and I watch a

409
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:31,810
review on them and apparently these do

410
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:33,040
dried down never try these before so

411
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:34,990
this could be an absolute disaster but

412
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,030
fingers crossed that this hopefully

413
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:38,650
finishes us up very very nicely because

414
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:41,170
I feel like where we're at right now

415
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:42,430
this look is not that bad

416
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:44,380
I'm just gonna go into my same Beauty

417
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:48,240
Blender and really lightly it go right

418
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:48,240
over the entire face

419
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:54,440
you guys wait a second this actually

420
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,899
kinda looks good before foundation

421
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,339
usually comes a primer but you guys know

422
00:14:56,899 --> 00:14:59,540
I stopped using it a long long time ago

423
00:14:58,339 --> 00:15:01,190
because I've always messed up my nose

424
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:03,800
contour so I guess this works my

425
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:06,019
advantage because I think I'm done okay

426
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:10,760
you guys looking in the mirror right now

427
00:15:06,019 --> 00:15:12,500
I am shucks out of my mind not even

428
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,480
gonna lie I picked this look today

429
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:16,820
because I wanted to challenge myself but

430
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,740
mostly because I thought this is gonna

431
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:21,740
be a major fail and would make for some

432
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:23,540
really comedic content listen you gotta

433
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:26,779
do what you gotta do YouTube just is not

434
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:29,420
the same anymore but I feel like this

435
00:15:26,779 --> 00:15:30,649
challenge we're such a success all right

00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:32,690
