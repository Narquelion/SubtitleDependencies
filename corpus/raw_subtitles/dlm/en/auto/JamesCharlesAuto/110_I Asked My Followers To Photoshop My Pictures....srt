00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,840
hi sisters james charles here and

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:05,520
welcome back to my youtube channel you

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,040
guys i am literally so beyond excited to

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,440
sit down and film today's video it is

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,280
not

6
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,639
even funny because you guys are gonna

7
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,920
get to be a part of it if you've been

8
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:13,679
following me on social media for a while

9
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,240
now on my instagram twitter or youtube

10
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,080
and i've seen

11
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,760
my photos you definitely know that i am

12
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,000
no stranger to photoshop and

13
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,800
facetune i really love editing my photos

14
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,240
and i've always been

15
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,760
super honest and transparent about that

16
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,439
with you guys which i think is very very

17
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,279
important but whether it be retouching a

18
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,960
makeup look or sometimes even taking a

19
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,720
simple boring photo and giving it a

20
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,880
full-on transformation into something

21
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,000
crazy i view editing as an art form my

22
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,920
social media accounts are like my

23
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,160
artistic portfolio and i think it is

24
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,520
so much fun adding things to photos that

25
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,440
couldn't actually be achieved with a

26
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,040
camera a few years ago i did a super fun

27
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,120
youtube video where i had you guys send

28
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,120
in your photos and i edited them on

29
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,960
camera but for today's youtube video i

30
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,760
want to send you guys my photos that i

31
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,680
want you

32
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,280
to edit me i'm honestly not sure if i

33
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:58,990
should be excited or nervous but

34
00:00:53,280 --> 00:01:02,029
let's go ahead and get started

35
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:02,029

00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,080
okay you guys i am so beyond excited and

37
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,119
also nervous to see what the heck people

38
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,720
are gonna come up with

39
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,159
today when i did this concept a few

40
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,000
years ago i had you guys send in your

41
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,760
selfies and i just edited on the makeup

42
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,360
which is of course super fun but for

43
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,080
this i literally want there to be

44
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,560

45
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,560

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,000
four photos and i cannot wait to see

47
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,840

48
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,280

51
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,320
but i also wanted to do a lot of

52
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,000

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,759

58
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,680
four of these photos to my twitter and

59
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,520

61
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,680

00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,200
these photos and then i'll be right back

63
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,799

00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,079
hello you guys i am back here in the

66
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,520
sister studio it has only been a few

67
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,200
seconds since you saw me last but it's

68
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,840
actually been about 48 hours since i

69
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,799
have last

70
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,439
filmed and you guys have gone absolutely

71
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,960
crazy

72
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,040
i think at this point the tweet has over

73
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,520
7 000 replies which is so

74
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,440
beyond crazy and i am so excited but

75
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,120
before we jump in i do have one super

76
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,480
quick announcement you may have noticed

77
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,599
the very very cute hoodie that i'm

78
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,520
wearing and also the

79
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,720
less cute makeup look i was trying

80
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,239
really hard to like match them together

81
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,920
but i just don't think that this color

82
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,840
situation was the right decision

83
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,920
anyway i am wearing the brand new

84
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,879

has been in the works for months now it

89
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,959
honestly felt like it was never gonna

90
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,319
actually happen because we have worked

91
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,879
so hard on making these completely

92
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,400

00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,919
don't know if i'll be able to use this

274
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:34,000

282
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:55,839

at least we know we have a hard working

290
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,560
good editor true this video

291
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,920
i think i should tell the backstory to

292
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,440
it because nobody knows the only reason

293
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,399
that my editor ryan even has this in the

294
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,640
first place is because

295
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,480
somebody posted a video of me singing

296
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,240
this song on tik tok and it went very

297
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,920
very viral now there's been a lot of

298
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,519
questions who is sylvie why is she

299
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,959
bringing me water why is james sitting

300
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,560
in the middle of a crowd of people on

301
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,959
the floor this is a choir song

302
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,000
and i was singing this song to a crowd

303
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,240
of fans

304
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,600
at my first ever meet and greet this was

305
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,200
when i had like a hundred thousand

306
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,560
followers there was like 50 people there

307
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,399
which was like the coolest

308
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,320
thing to happen to me ever at that point

309
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,920
in my life we hung out took pictures

310
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,880
together and just like chatting and then

311
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,680
they were like oh my god we should all

312
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,440
sing together

313
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,720
so i was like oh my god i want to teach

314
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,399
you guys this song

315
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,920
so i sat on the floor and then taught

316
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,880
them all three parts to bring your

317
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,720
little water selfie

318
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,080
unfortunately for me that was the only

319
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,920
part that was caught on camera

320
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,200
none of the performance altogether

321
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,680
actually was although that probably

322
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,600
wasn't

323
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,200
great either so i hope that at this

324
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,640
point sylvie brought the water because

325
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,800
i'm sick of hearing about it bring me a

326
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,210

327
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:14,609

million years could have imagined

416
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,399
idea to you of shooting this video and

417
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,079
you're really excited because you watch

418
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,399
a bunch of photoshop youtubers all the

419
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,120
time

420
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,000
all the time every day yes and i know

421
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,120
one of your favorites

422
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,440
is betty productions yes and so

423
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,680
we reached out to him and he said he

424
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,320
would make an edit for you

425
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,320
i'm so scared

426
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:29,120
yes oh my god

427
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,920
oh my god oh wow i'm literally

428
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,519
speechless this to me is a prime example

429
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,959
of why i consider photo editing like a

430
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,480
full-on art form obviously like

431
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,600
retouching it like this or two very

432
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,120
different feels but like they're still

433
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,199
to me equally as important to making a

434
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,480
full image like this is so sick not only

435
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,079
did he completely move my feet around he

436
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,680
put me underwater he added the light

437
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,959
reflection from the jellyfish i look

438
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,160
like i'm literally glowing

439
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,880
the oh my god this is why i love this

440
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,639
stuff so much

441
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,920

442
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,880

443
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,199
