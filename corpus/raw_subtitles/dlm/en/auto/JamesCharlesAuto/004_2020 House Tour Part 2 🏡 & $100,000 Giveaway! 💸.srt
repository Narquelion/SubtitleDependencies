house that i have not yet

13
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,400
shown you guys ever since i started

14
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,119
doing youtube about four or five years

15
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,640
ago now

16
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,480
i have been dreaming of what it would be

17
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,239
like to have the perfect

18
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,000
sister's headquarters we've been

19
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,840
renovating for months

20
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,280
and i'm so excited to tell you guys that

21
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,879
those dreams have finally

22
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,160
come true when i was looking to buy my

23
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,440
first ever house it was really important

24
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,360
to me that i was able to have a good

25
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,039
work life balance but for me since my

26
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,800
work takes up so much of my life it was

27
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,320
really hard to actually find that so we

28
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,360
found this house that had a basement it

29
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,280
was like literally

30
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,719
a message from heaven above and i knew

31
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,840
that this was going to be the one

32
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,559
because we were able to turn this

33
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,879
basement

34
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,000
into the dream sisters headquarters and

35
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,120
i'm so excited to show

36
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,160
you guys there's a lot that i want to

37
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,879
show you so let's go ahead and get

38
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:13,040
started with the first room which is

39
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:16,380
the sister cinema

40
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:19,940
[Music]

41
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,940
[Applause]

43
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,960
andrew

44
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,479
we're here in the movie theater which is

45
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,759
like i can't believe that that sentence

46
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,280
just left my mouth like the fact that i

47
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,520
have a movie theater in my house

48
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,880
is so cool it's not even funny this was

49
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,720
actually not on like my

50
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,240
requirements list when shopping for

51
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,960
homes but i certainly am not complaining

52
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,560
this is like

53
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,680
the best thing to ever happen to us as

54
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,119
you can see we have a bunch of different

55
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,680
reclining chairs that do actually

56
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,040
recline

57
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,960
would you like to demonstrate trevor of

58
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,479
course oh yeah sure

59
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,240
oh this goes right back favorite

60
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,799
projector with a big screen obviously

61
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,200
there

62
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,040
we have some gorgeous candies instead of

63
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,040
gorgeous i love gorgeous skin

64
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,960
some delicious candies really lined up

65
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,479
so you can pick your favorite a popcorn

66
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,159
machine over here as well so literally

67
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,880
any snack that you could possibly

68
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,360
want to indulge in a gorgeous snack if

69
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,959
you will

70
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,800
we have right here in the cinema well

71
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,920
i'll let you two boys watch

72
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,920
this for some reason

73
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,640
coming out of the theater right over

74
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,239
here we have the conference room which i

75
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,120
actually was not really expecting to use

76
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,560
that often

77
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,000
in the last house we honestly had a lot

78
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,879
of our meetings in like the kitchen and

79
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,400
the living room

80
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,840
but this has been really really helpful

81
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,879
to just kind of separate once again

82
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,319
living and working

83
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,239
and my team and i have meetings in here

84
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,360
literally all the time we have this

85
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,959
massive table a bunch of different

86
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,000
dining chairs we also have a tv on the

87
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,480
wall which normally is

88
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,319
not playing my videos it's for airplay

89
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,959
any like presentations or projects or

90
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,959
anything

91
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,319
and also for virtual zoom calls we have

92
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,760
an acrylic board over there for any

93
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,959
calendaring and planning then finally

94
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,319
two different art prints from different

95
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,599
exciting moments in my career

96
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,920
okay so coming out of the conference

97
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,319
room we have don't fit into this just

98
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,480
yet

99
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,800
and over here in this hallway is the

100
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,560
sister salaam now this is once again

101
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,840
a room that i didn't expect to have in

102
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,800
this house but i'm definitely not

103
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,959
complaining

104
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,360
it is so cool in here obviously being a

105
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,280
beauty guru beauty related tasks are a

106
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,879
huge part of my calendar and daily life

107
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,560
so this room is like the perfect place

108
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,920
for all that to happen we have these

109
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,840
massive beautiful vanities for

110
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,760
impressions with barber chairs as well

111
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,120
so i use this area to get ready and also

112
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,360
get my hair cut which is

113
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,200
so nice in the last house i was getting

114
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,560
ready and filming in the same studio

115
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,840
which was you know not the end of the

116
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,519
world but it would literally look like a

117
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,280
tornado had gone through it every single

118
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,120
day which was an absolute

119
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,400
nightmare so now i get to separate

120
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,239
getting glam for fun

121
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,760
and actually filming videos we also have

122
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,239
a table over here where i get my nails

123
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,319
done with

124
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,920
chad you guys saw that in the long nails

125
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,640
for a day video which was absolutely

126
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,799
crazy

127
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,400
we have our 1 million and our 10 million

128
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,720
plaques and then finally we have this

129
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,239
beautiful wall of fully sound wings

130
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,599
ready to go if i ever need to do a

131
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,959
transformation now you guys have seen

132
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,120
the movie theater the conference room

133
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,239
and the salon and there's one more room

134
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,080
that i need to show you guys in the

135
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,040
basement and it is my favorite room of

136
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,640
the entire

137
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,319
house having a master production space

138
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,680
has been a dream of mine for so

139
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,120
long now when i first started doing

140
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,400
youtube videos almost four years ago i

141
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,760
was filming in a little corner my

142
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,760
parents paste it with just two soft

143
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,280
boxes finally in this house i can

144
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,080
finally say that i have my dream

145
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:15,530
production

146
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:18,610
space come on in to sister studios

147
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,610
[Music]

148
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,560
okay so obviously this space is

149
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,479
absolutely massive this is definitely

150
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,240
where most of the renovations took place

151
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,840
and you're probably wondering james how

152
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,080
did you end up with a production studio

153
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,680
in

154
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,520
your basement and that is a great

155
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,080
question when we first moved in

156
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,600
fun fact this entire area was actually

157
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,000
an indoor pool which is

158
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,919
yes a subtle flex but was just so

159
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,400
unnecessary to me so we decided to fill

160
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,240
it in

161
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,759
put it in hardwood floors and now this

162
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,160
is the absolute dream

163
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,600
studio space as you guys can see right

164
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,360
over here i have my full-on

165
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,520
camera setup which is such an upgrade

166
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,960
from the last studio i am such a massive

167
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,680
nerd for production at heart so it has

168
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,360
honestly been

169
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,960
so much fun for me to challenge myself

170
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,320
and to try to keep upgrading our studios

171
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,840
and our setup to ultimately make the

172
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,440
best content for you guys

173
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,280
we have our camera and our tripod we

174
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,199
have our monitors the microphone

175
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,960
the diffuser the big lights everything

176
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,240
from the backdrop and it is all hanging

177
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,639
from the ceiling as well which makes it

178
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,199
so

179
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,720
much cleaner if i sit down to film a

180
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,000
video this is what you guys see

181
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,360
i have a monitor in front of me to see

182
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,440
what i'm doing there's a monitor behind

183
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,160
the camera for lewis and there's also

184
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,960
a tv right over there so any guests can

185
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,479
see it as well

186
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,360
which is super awesome i always like to

187
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,880
have a lot of people in the room when

188
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,240
they film my videos and our last studio

189
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,919
was really small and crowded which

190
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,039
became a problem quite a lot so it was

191
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,400
really important for this face that we

192
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,080
were able to have a seating area

193
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,840
we have our couch and chairs and then

194
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,320
also like i was saying this tv here as

195
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,000
well

196
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,400
which is great for anybody that comes

197
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,720
over has a team or assistance along with

198
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,240
them

199
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,000
they can sit and get work done and also

200
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,680
have easy access to see what's going on

201
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,199
behind the camera as well opposite the

202
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,720
sitting area next to the filming setup

203
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,280
we also have another paper backdrop

204
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,199
system

205
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,960
and this is for photos we have the same

206
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,880
exact camera and the same exact lens

207
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,639
some more lights as well and just a fun

208
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,080
little backdrop so you're able to shoot

209
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,600
photos for assistance apparel or any

210
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,120
other photo shoots that we have going on

211
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,160
which is honestly really really helpful

212
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,520
as well so therefore we don't have to

213
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,400
keep doing everything around taking

214
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,000
lights up and down

215
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,680
it's honestly just such a hassle so this

216
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,120
just makes everything so much easier

217
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,400
and i cannot wait to see what magic

218
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,880
we're going to create in this photo

219
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,479
studio

220
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,479
moving right along to this wall we have

221
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:14,800
two very very special rooms

222
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,000
and these are the sister studios but not

223
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,479
the video studios

224
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,479
the recording studio these used to be a

225
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,600
steam room and a sauna once again for

226
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,280
the indoor pool

227
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,639
but we really wanted to make it much

228
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,680
more personal and you guys know how much

229
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,520
of a big part of my life

230
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,120
music is so we figured it'd be only

231
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,319
appropriate to build out the ultimate

232
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,080
recording studio

233
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,280
to mix the music one day it is not done

234
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,560
quite yet we're still waiting on some

235
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,800
equipment and furniture but

236
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,600
we are so close and it's looking so good

237
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,199
so far

238
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,120
the walls are fully padded and

239
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,560
soundproof we have a custom desk built

240
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,319
we also have these really cool clouds in

241
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,600
the ceiling from the brand room cloud

242
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,280
they gifted them to us and it just

243
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,400
creates such a fun vibe in here and i

244
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,919
cannot wait to see what we're going to

245
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,360
create in here as well

246
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,960
one day very very soon and then right

247
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,240
next door to the mixing room we also

248
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,780
have the recording room

249
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,840
which is

250
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:59,520
[Music]

251
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,960
obviously very secure door very

252
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,720
soundproof in here so you can record

253
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,319
vocals and nobody's going to hear it

254
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,000
some more of ib clouds and then you have

255
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,199
a window so i can see lewis yelling at

256
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,479
me telling me that my pitch is wrong

257
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,599
from the other room all right you guys

258
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,360
and the last place that i want to show

259
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:14,160
you in the sister studio

260
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,280
is the sister store so many fun s words

261
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,800
this like i was saying

262
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,319
used to be the indoor pool so this is

263
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,360
actually the indoor gym

264
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,120
but now this is the stuff

265
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,240
this is the storage room so it was

266
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,000
really important to me that we were able

267
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,599
to create an area oh look at trevor just

268
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,880
being such a good employer working at

269
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,919
the store

270
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,680
it was really important for me that we

271
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,039
were able to create an area not only for

272
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,120
storage of sisters apparel

273
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,960
but also for all of our makeup stuff as

274
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,560
well as you guys can see this entire

275
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,840
wall is all different makeup items that

276
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,280
i have in my collection

277
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,759
once again similar to the pantry

278
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,759
organized by the queen herself

279
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,919
have all of our categories foundations

280
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,000
powders brow stuff we have

281
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,680
palettes tools we have all these eye

282
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,400
glitters and eye tools we have

283
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,919
lashes lipsticks literally everything in

284
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,520
my collection is beautifully displayed

285
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,800
so i know exactly where it is and i can

286
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,479
pull it really easily if i need to go

287
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,759
film a video out in the studio and then

288
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,520
on the other side of the room we have an

289
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,800
entire wall dedicated to sister's

290
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,160
apparel we have all of our different

291
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,599
colored hoodies that we've released

292
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,280
and we also always have our current

293
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,960
collections as well it was super

294
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,319
important to us to have a full on stock

295
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,879
because friends and family come over

296
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,639
literally

297
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,000
all the time and are complaining to us

298
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,479
that the last collection sold out way

299
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,759
too fast

300
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,039
that they need their hoodie so whenever

301
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,639
we have friends or guests over we could

302
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,000
always put together cute goodie bags or

303
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,120
we also have the full collection

304
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,479

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,519
a 20 million subscriber special

324
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,360
i think at this point that is the

325
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,800
basement all complete which means

326
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,959
the house is all complete but there's

327
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:08,440
still one last place to take you guys

328
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:13,920
and that is upstairs to the backyard

329
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:15,760
[Music]

330
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,200
okay you guys just like the basement the

331
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,720
backyard literally looked

332
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,120
nothing like this when we first moved in

333
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,080
because it underwent a lot of different

334
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,440
renovations

335
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,040
and this is probably the space that i'm

336
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,399
most excited about i know i keep saying

337
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,120
that but literally like i just love all

338
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,399
the spaces

339
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,240
and i'm so excited to share with you

340
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,519
guys the last house in the last yard was

341
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,600
really not it for a lot of different

342
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,560
reasons the first one being it was just

343
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,320
too small not for us but for fit again

344
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,399
the last yard was so tiny but now we

345
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,200
have this entire space dedicated to this

346
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,640
little one

347
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,560
running around having the time of his

348
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,440
life with all of his toys and he has

349
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,320
never been

350
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,839
happier also as you can see there is a

351
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,600
massive pool which has been

352
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,880
incredible in the last house we were

353
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,720
really never in the pool because of the

354
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,480
way that it was positioned in the yard

355
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,560
anytime after like noon when the sun

356
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,240
starts to go down it was completely in

357
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,360
the shade so the pool was always cold we

358
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,920
were never in it but

359
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,440
this pool is not the case at all it is

360
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,160
huge and it is smack dab in the middle

361
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,760
of the yard

362
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,279
it gets done all day long and we have

363
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,720
been spending so many days

364
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,720
chilling by the pool or just swimming

365
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,160
and it has been literally like a dream

366
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,680
come true now i want to take you guys

367
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,040
over to this side of the yard because

368
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,360
this is where most of the changes took

369
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,160
place

370
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,600
and i am literally in love this is like

371
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,360
the outdoor kitchen and

372
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,720
seating area now when we first moved

373
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,079
into the house there was actually two

374
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,680
different pool houses

375
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,040
one right here and one over there where

376
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,640
the fireplace is now which you'll see in

377
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,399
a second a lot of times builders in la

378
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,279
will add guest houses or pool houses to

379
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,959
their properties

380
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,480
just because they can add square footage

381
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,320
to the listing which literally equates

382
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,600
to hundreds of thousands of dollars

383
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,279
sometimes which is

384
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,880
like mind-blowing to me it's truly a

385
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,640
sister scam and obviously i had

386
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,480
no reason for either one of them so we

387
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,839
converted the first pool house into an

388
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,800
outdoor kitchen which turned out

389
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,079
absolutely

390
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,839
sunny we have these beautiful black

391
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,440
countertops and bar stools so my friends

392
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,480
and i can sit out here and eat if the

393
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,959
boys are over

394
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,079
and grilling some nice delicious meats

395
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,920
um we have

396
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,760
an outdoor fridge and we also have a tv

397
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,440
as well which does rotate so we can

398
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,320
watch music videos or the boys can watch

399
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,160
sport games

400
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,279
during our outdoor barbecues we have

401
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,480
these four trees that surround the

402
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,760
outdoor eating area

403
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,440
along with string lights as well which i

404
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,079
feel like creates just like a magical

405
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,360
vibe

406
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,560
and i really like how it feels a little

407
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,680
bit more separated from the rest of the

408
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,760
yard as well

409
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,279
we went with a massive concrete dining

410
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,399
table in the middle with a ton of

411
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,360
different seats around it so we can all

412
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,640
have family dinners

413
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,240
when the backyard was finally finished

414
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,440
my friends and i decided to cook for

415
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,880
once in our lives

416
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,399
and set up a cute little dining table

417
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,079
out here i think i posted on my

418
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,640
instagram stories actually and we ate

419
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,000
dinner

420
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,600
and then brought out some card games and

421
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,440
stuff and we ended up being out here

422
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,399
losing chocolate time until like three

423
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,839
in the morning

424
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,279
it was so much fun it was such a good

425
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,560
vibe and that's how you know you've

426
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,760
created a magical space

427
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,600
now if you guys follow me right along

428
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,360
this way next to the outdoor kitchen we

429
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,519
have a cute little ping pong table

430
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,519
for nice games we have three little

431
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,680
trees as well which are babies right now

432
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,920
but will eventually be limes lemons and

433
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,760
oranges for our citrus in the morning

434
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,120
and then this is a really fun part of

435
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,519
the backyard as well

436
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,959
this is our outdoor fireplace so right

437
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,240
here used to be the other

438
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:05,440
pool house as well which we ended up

439
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:08,160
removing but now it is this beautiful

440
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,839
sit-in full stucco white fireplace and i

441
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,680
am

442
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:13,279
absolutely obsessed we've already had so

443
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,720
many fun nights roasting marshmallows by

444
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,480
the fire and just sitting in here and

445
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,000
talking and relaxing and a much better

446
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,560
use of the space than what was here

447
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,920
before

448
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,040
also i mentioned in the last video that

449
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,839
i really wanted to give shout outs to

450
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,680
the people that made this home

451
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,480
renovation project rewarding instead of

452
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,480
stressful

453
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,600
and one person that i definitely owe a

454
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,360
ton of thanks to

455
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,959
is jonathan juan with racing green

456
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,440
construction he literally

457
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,880
took this backyard from drab to fab and

458
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,399
i do mean that literally just like

459
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,920
leclaire decor as soon as jonathan and

460
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,760
racing green came onto the project it

461
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,560
was like magic waiting to happen and i

462
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,480
was just so

463
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,920
so grateful every single step of the way

464
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,160

as well this is obviously my first home

467
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,959
purchase which was

468
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,800
really exciting but really really scary

469
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,480
as well there are so many things

470
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,240
that you would never like expect to deal

471
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,519
with being a homeowner i know that i

472
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,880
didn't expect to deal with obviously

473
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,680
jonathan and his team were amazing at

474
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,880
construction

475
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,560
but i also just want to say a major

476
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,079
thank you to him because he truly kind

477
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,200
of like took on a fatherly role with me

478
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,880
with this whole process

479
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,560
which just made it so much easier and

480
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,760
way more fun as well so to jonathan i

481
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,200

486
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,600
down to this here

487
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,959
and on to the basketball court if you

488
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,720
know me you know that i'm not really a

489
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,440
sporty person so you're probably

490
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,200
wondering

491
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,880
why the heck i have this in the house

492
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,720
although i will not be using this very

493
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,600
often i do have quite a lot of boys in

494
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,440
my life

495
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,800
louis loves basketball a lot of my

496
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,000
friends husbands do as well

497
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,440
who knows maybe one day with a little

498
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,920
bit of practice i could be lebron james

499
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,920
charles

500
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,639
i'm gonna stick with makeup now i

501
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,279
clearly am not a basketball star and

502
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,480
that's fine

503
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,000
okay i know what i'm good at and i'm

504
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,880
gonna leave that part of the yard to

505
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,199
everybody else

506
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,800
but this part of the yard is mine we

507
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,199
have this massive oak tree right here

508
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,639
which is

509
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:54,240
so beautiful we have this fun little

510
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,839
hanging chair as well which is

511
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,440
such a vibe honestly i have been just

512
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,279
sitting out here reading and looking at

513
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,240
my phone going over business emails so

514
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,600
often and then finally the best part of

515
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,199
the entire house

516
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,720
the in-ground trampoline now when i

517
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,399
first moved in this entire area used to

518
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,760
be a putting green and no offense to any

519
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,560
golfers or anything it's just the only

520
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,560
thing that i would want

521
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,800
my house but i have wanted an ingrown

522
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,600
trampoline in my home for so long now

523
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,040
and it is finally a reality and oh my

524
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,680
god we have literally been out here

525
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,440
non-stop jumping doing tricks being

526
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,720
flips double bouncing each other

527
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,320
and also just sitting out here talking

528
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,000
and trying to touch the leaves as well

529
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,600
this is literally an olympic

530
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,639
braid trampoline and it is so

531
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,880

00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,000

533
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,760
i'm out of breath

534
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,519

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,560
of filming this house tour video
