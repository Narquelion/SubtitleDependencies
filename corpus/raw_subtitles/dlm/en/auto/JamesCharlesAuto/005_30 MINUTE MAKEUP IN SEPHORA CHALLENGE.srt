1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,330
my sisters James Charles Sturt and

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,380
welcome back to our YouTube channel as

3
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,910
you guys didn't see we're not in the

4
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,099
normal makeup studio and for today's

5
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:09,000
video we were doing a super super fine

6
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:10,800
makeup challenge

7
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,540
I am literally so pumped for this but

8
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,429
also a little bit nervous I'm not gonna

9
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,619
lie if he makes ago I saw my good-ass

10
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:18,779
sister nikita dragon do video where she

11
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:20,039
got ready and Sephora using all tests or

12
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:22,529
makeup and for today's I'm gonna

13
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,840
recreate that video by nikita but we're

14
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:25,949
gonna try to do it under 30 minutes

15
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,090
I feel like 30 is a pretty good number

16
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:28,740
for this video being that the average

17
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,210
person probably sends around 20 minutes

18
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,289
on their everyday makeup routine and for

19
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,480
a special event they may take a little

20
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:35,969
bit more time also for me my average

21
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:38,430
makeup routine takes me around two hours

22
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:39,600
so 30 bits is definitely a huge major

23
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,160
challenge we also have to take into

24
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,210
consideration that every Sephora is

25
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,440
different and the layouts are all

26
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,489
different so a lot of that time is

27
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,110
probably gonna be spent finding my

28
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:47,700
shades and finding the products in

29
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,200
general I'm gonna be getting ready today

30
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,760
using all the makeup in Sephora

31
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,250
including their spooky lighting and

32
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,660
mirrors but I did pick out a few things

33
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,579
that I wanted to bring here from home

34
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,780
starting off with a damp Beauty sponge

35
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:59,129
to blend in my foundation

36
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,020
I've brushes that I felt like I could

37
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:02,340
not do a makeup routine without being a

38
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,739
contour brush that I'm also gonna use

39
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,810
for brush lush hello in powder a nose

40
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,490
contouring brush a a flat tub concealer

41
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,290
brush a highlighting brush and then a

42
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,640
pencil brush and finally I also grabbed

43
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,350
a pair of lashes these are the new

44
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,180
bouncing Bella's obviously being a

45
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:16,200
makeup source Sephora does sell all the

46
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,150
items that I'm gonna be bringing with me

47
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,650
today but first of all that's kind of

48
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,240
really unsanitary I'm definitely not

49
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:23,939
trying to get any size or disease or

50
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,140

stealing and for me personally I'm

56
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,170
trying to get a house and a boyfriend

57
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:38,939

58
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,710

right now I have my damp Beauty Blender

118
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,190
still you guys know that is I talked

119
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,570
about my tips and tricks to getting a

120
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:29,370
perfect SCANA when you're doing your

121
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:30,299
base makeup and the one trick that I

122
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,590
talked about was when you're shopping

123
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:33,150
for a foundation you should always go

124
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:34,620
outside and look at your shade range

125
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,060
with a mirror before you actually put it

126
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,160
on and buy in a store because the

127
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,000
lighting in Sephora is all obviously

128
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,019
fluorescent lights and outside lighting

129
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,340
is obviously where you want to make sure

130
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,959
your foundation really really matches

131
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,040

132
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,799

routine actually you know what maybe I

268
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,010
should use the goof proof brow pencil

269
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,150
instead okay

270
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:55,950
Kratz op we're using the benefit

271
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:56,970
precisely or hollow benefit group we

00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:01,290
benefit group ooh prep pencil number 5

to snatch my brows up really quickly I

275
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:04,320
normally hate these shape of brow

276
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,760
pencils but it's much bigger and we

277
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,940
really don't have a lot of time left so

278
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,200
I need to cover the most

279
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:10,630
Brow's space in the short amount of time

280
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:12,520
possible disabilities and like normal

281
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:14,230
starting at the bottom of the brow using

282
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:17,080
light strokes and then going right in an

283
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:18,430
affiliate oh no you're kidding hello

284
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,440

285
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:22,030

286
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,050
the eyebrow okay you know what we do

288
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:26,050
clean it up in a second we'll see if we

289
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:27,760
can do this one a little better my brows

290
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:29,170

291
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,310
least favorite parts I make appreciate

292
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:31,750
it because it's to do the same thing

293
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:33,099
every single time like you never get to

294
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,539

295
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:36,130
can finish my eyebrows and have them

296
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:38,560
looking decent with a few minutes

297
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:40,419

313
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:15,670

a decent sense of round let's be real

317
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:22,450
could be a little better but it

318
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:25,300
definitely could be a whole lot worse

319
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:26,890
let's pull in that concealer down to my

320
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:29,080

time for eyeshadow look today but I

323
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,779

can use my fingers to blow us houses I

325
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:36,029

326
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,139

really really bomb mascara using mascara

334
00:09:48,179 --> 00:09:51,600
from Sephora testers is probably one of

335
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:53,970
the worst ideas ever in the entire row

336
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,079

363
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,980
harder than I expected

364
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,779
like I was saying going into all the

365
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:02,279
products that I usually need are all

366
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:03,660
over the place in every different

367
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:05,309
Sephora whereas in my neural maker

368
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,449
pretend I have everything right down in

369
00:11:05,309 --> 00:11:07,679
front of me I think majority of this

370
00:11:06,449 --> 00:11:09,689
challenge is actually spent with me

371
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:11,129
running around Sephora not being able to

372
00:11:09,689 --> 00:11:12,839
make decisions on what products they

373
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:14,339
wanted to use or where I wanted to use

374
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,230
them and not really took away from a lot

375
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:17,279
of the time doing my actual makeup I

376
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:18,809
feel like the primary foundation

377
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,429
application were really fine but we've

378
00:11:18,809 --> 00:11:21,779
definitely lost it at concealer you guys

379
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:23,189
know that my go-to is always the charge

380
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:24,779
tape tape which I don't actually carry

381
00:11:23,189 --> 00:11:25,949
out Sephora and I have not used the

382
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:27,689
different concealer than that and

383
00:11:25,949 --> 00:11:28,860
literally it's been a good like year I

384
00:11:27,689 --> 00:11:30,029
think now I think it was definitely

385
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:32,040
little bit shook when I had to use a

386
00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:34,049
lesser coverage concealer and I think

387
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,999
from that moment on we were just screwed

388
00:11:34,049 --> 00:11:37,769
miss laura mercier she was a smarter

389
00:11:35,999 --> 00:11:40,399
sister because she didn't stock up a

390
00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:40,399
single Oh

391
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:50,030
hooray stock Dustin you played me real

392
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:51,560
good with a cow well now there's powder

393
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:53,750
here but beforehand

394
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:55,700
there was no miss Laura Mercier so I did

395
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:58,610
not get to set my face today Wow I love

396
00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:00,320
when that happened hurts and then we

397
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:01,400
moved on to of course contouring of

398
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,240
course we had the Kat Von D and light

399
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,370
palette you guys know that is my

400
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,600
all-time favorite and then baking once

401
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:06,740
again we had no chances of sending

402
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,570
powders and we had to end up going with

403
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:09,620
rubber FX powder which I've never

404
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,190
actually used it for let's see how she

405
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:12,230
looks

406
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:13,610
oh not that bad okay it went on very

407
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:14,930
very white and was definitely sticking

408
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:16,640
on my face white as well so I was a

409
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:17,960
little bit spooked not gonna lie that it

410
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,940
wasn't gonna work out but I think my

411
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,740
face actually looks really really good

412
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:23,660
the lashes are there but I wouldn't

413
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:25,160
necessarily call them on I don't believe

414
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,540
in a good pair of tweezers for la chop

415
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,710
location so definitely not the best and

416
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:29,180
then of course we did we had a few

417
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:30,710
seconds up to put on our lipstick I went

418
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,760
with just a tart liquid lipstick I hate

419
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:33,290
that's color but it'll be the first

420
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,940
thing that I grabbed with me looks fine

421
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:36,650
at this challenge I think was a success

422
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:39,200
I finished everything in time my face

423
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:40,580
doesn't look the best but from far away

424
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,690
and a little bit of Phase two I feel

425
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:43,810
like we could definitely power for a

426
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:45,980
full on event ready glam

427
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:47,780
maybe alright you guys we just got home

428
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:49,550
from Sephora and not complete says get

429
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:51,140
ready with me in Sephora using all

430
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:52,910
tested makeup at under 30 minute

431
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:55,160
challenge we need a better name for that

432
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:57,050
ASAP I had so much fun filming this

433
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,220
challenge today you guys an overall even

434
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:59,960
though my face doesn't look as perfect

435
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:01,370
as I usually like it too I'm definitely

436
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,480
really happy with the results and I

437
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:03,290
think that that answers the burning

438
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,480
question that we've all been wondering

439
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:08,240
is it possible to get fully ready in

440
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:10,010
Sephora yes I think it really is of

441
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,510
course I did bring a few tools but you

442
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:13,760
know we're just being a sanitarium

443
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:15,500
sisters just a quick little sister just

444
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,120
claim her as well at the end of all my

445
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,410
challenge videos I always say baby I

446
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,670
showed this one at home make sure to

447
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:21,680
shoot me a picture and let me know how

448
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:23,510
Wetmore for this one please do not try

449
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,400
to duplicate this one we did talk to the

450
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:26,720
manager staff a Sephora beforehand and

451
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,070
made sure not only was it okay to fill

452
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,600
in there but also do this challenge in

453
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:31,280
general they were kind enough to let us

454
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,930
do this but that's only because they

455
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,340
knew who I was I shop there all the time

456
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:36,470
and I know that I was a beauty guru

457
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:37,940
filming this for a YouTube video lets me

458
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:39,110
straight up and real we have all brought

459
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:41,120
products before especially from

460
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:43,290
drugstore where you can't actually try

461
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,089
it out and we've put it on and

462
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:46,500
literally loved the worst so I think

463
00:13:45,089 --> 00:13:48,300
that the fact they were able to try out

464
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,740
products in Sephora before actually

465
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,509
buying them is such an incredibly

466
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:53,279
helpful system that makes makeup

467
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:54,750
shopping so much easier and although

468
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,730
this challenge is very very fun to film

469
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,899
for you guys please do not do this

470
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:59,790
because at the end of the day it's very

471
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:01,110
much taking advantage of Sephora and I

472
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:02,910
don't want to do that to them if there's

473
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:04,259
an emergency situation definitely go in

474
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:06,000
for a good impression sister glam

475
00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:06,990
touch-up the staff is all amazing and

476
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,790
will definitely help you look at the

477
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:10,620
beautiful and fabulous but anything more

478
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:12,120
you're doing that at your own risk

479
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,290
you do not hear this from me Oh Papa

480
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,339
