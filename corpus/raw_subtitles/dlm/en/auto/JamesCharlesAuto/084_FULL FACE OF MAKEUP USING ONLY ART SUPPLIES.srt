00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,959
hi sisters James Turrell turn welcome

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,069
back to my youtube channel you guys for

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:06,899
today's video I am a little bit doing

4
00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:08,460
something that I've wanted to do for so

5
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:10,469
long now this has been on my video ID

6
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,849
list for like a million years I don't

7
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:13,590
know why I've never gotten to it I think

8
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:15,809
I've been too scared of the idea but you

9
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,760
know what I love a good sister challenge

10
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:19,770
and for today's video I went to Hobby

11
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,330
Lobby of Michaels every craft store I

12
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:24,539
could possibly find and I'm gonna be

13
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:27,119
getting a fully ready hopefully using

14
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:28,289
all art supplies at this point I think I

15
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,179
am a little bit a broken record was

16
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:32,399
saying like oh my god I started doing

17
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:34,860
makeup for the are we gonna James you

18
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,230
think you're talented who art has always

19
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,820
been a huge huge huge passion of mine

20
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,170
and it's what got me into makeup but

21
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,969
even before doing makeup I was always

22
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:43,170
drawing always painting always coloring

23
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:45,000
to a lot of the materials they have here

24
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:48,750
in front of me such as chalk pastels

25
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,760
paint brushes watercolors face paint and

26
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,710
sponges I am definitely not a stranger

27
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,270
to but they usually do not go on the

28
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,710
face I think this we are really fun and

29
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,449
potentially dangerous challenge

30
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,219
hopefully I don't get a break out from

31
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:01,170
using this stuff on my face but you know

32
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:03,840
what that's why it's called a challenge

33
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:10,200
I got without further ado let's jump

34
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:12,540
right into the video for foundation

35
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,460
today I got this tempera paint by upon

36
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,030
reading the label that says warning not

37
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:20,549
safe for consumption can cause cancer

38
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:21,900
great so this is not happening today I'm

39
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:24,270
just gonna use my normal foundation and

40
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:27,060
powder but I did find these natural fine

41
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:28,380
sponges at the craft store so Beauty

42
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,290
Blender never heard of her

43
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:33,030
we're gonna use a natural fine sponge

44
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:34,680

45
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,970

today when I think of artists why I was

51
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:44,610
like the first thing to come to mind a

52
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:47,460
little French man with a beret and a

53
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:49,470
little mustache painting it a little

54
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:51,360

hello what's going on - my fellow beauty

62
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:11,009
gurus out there who may be watching this

63
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,160
video I don't ever want to hear a single

64
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:14,380
one of y'all ever say

65
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,230
I'm just gonna paint this on until using

66
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:19,900
an actual paintbrush surprisingly this

67
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:25,960
is like not that Bob can't forget to

68
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:27,550
blend down the neck that I'm just gonna

69
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,020
take one of my own natural blending

70
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:31,390
sponges and dip it into the access

71
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:34,870
product on at the pallet and use that to

72
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:36,160
kind of stipple it end oh my god this is

73
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,780
kind of working Picasso is gonna be

74
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,100
trembling in his grave can I say that is

75
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:40,360
that offensive for a concealer of course

76
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:42,250
they're gonna grab my tart shave tape

77
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,110
and this is in the shade light neutral

78
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:45,730
and I'm gonna put it o want my little

79
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:47,530
pal ain't I need to stop doing about

80
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:50,260
right now and then to apply I'm gonna

81
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:52,320
use this filbert 8 brush this literally

82
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:54,070
looks like a more PM 2 to 4

83
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,080
conspiracy-theory morphe brushes are

84
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:58,210
just artist brushes repackage whoa

85
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,570
low-key why is this brush like really

86
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:03,010
good this is doc really staying in my

87
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,500
collection for hot dog creases you've

88
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:06,970
got to be kidding me okay once again

89
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,110
beauty sponge to blend it all out now

90
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,060
that my face is all set in place I'm

91
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:11,740
going to set it using another natural

92
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:13,360
sponge and then it's the Laura Mercier

93
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:16,660
translucent setting powder this I'm

94
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,820
actually scared about okay I'll sit in

95
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,290
there Oh God so now that we have the

96
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,520
base all down in set in place we can

97
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:24,070
finally start building on top of it

98
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:26,050
using our art supplies so for contouring

99
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:29,800
I think I'm gonna go into this 48 colors

100
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:32,170
soft chalk pastels kit and hopefully

101
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:34,600
find a warm tone a contour shade in here

102
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:36,670
if I can get this open okay so we have

103
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,840
our two sets of pastels right here the

104
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:41,020
way it was packaged but it looks like

105
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,900
there were more inside and they're not

106
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:46,540
so our contour options here are very

107
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:49,330
very limited as you can tell the only

108
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:53,350
two shades that may help us out are this

109
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:58,840
a very very bright burnt orange and this

110
00:03:53,350 --> 00:04:00,280
very very dark brown this could be where

111
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,320
it goes back to cause my face today I'm

112
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,709
going to use this masters touch oil and

113
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:06,790
acrylic

114
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:08,590
number four thirty round mop brush once

115
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:10,750
again morphe is there something you're

116
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:15,190
not telling us okay maybe if I like

117
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:16,750
scrape off oh my god some of the pigment

118
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:19,060
oh there we go okay there's my word

119
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,410
bingo we've cracked the code ladies I'm

120
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,030
just gonna scrape off a little bit of

121
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,830
the

122
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:25,740
burnt orange shade as wells we have like

123
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:28,650
a blush situation gonna grab my around

124
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:32,270
mop brush and dip into those two

125
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:36,900
pigments tap off the excess and

126
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:38,700
hopefully wow a benefit hoola bronzer

127
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:41,370
whoo Kat Von D shade and light palette

128
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:42,780
whoo Anasazi Beverly Hills contour kit

129
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:46,400
never heard of her

130
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:51,540
okay clearly we're going for a beachy

131
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:52,920
sunkissed look today that's what we're

132
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,660
going for yes correct

133
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,070
I obviously love that I'm complaining

134
00:04:54,660 --> 00:05:00,180
about my face being orange when I just

135
00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:01,770
used this to contour oh god I'm gonna

136
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:03,330
attempt to contour and snatch my nose

137
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:07,860
instead of using me once again oil

138
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:09,960
acrylic 425 Obul mop brush once again

139
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,060
this is literally a fluffy crease brush

140
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:14,510
what is going on say a silent prayer for

141
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,510
me on this one

142
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:25,479
oh okay not the worst but definitely not

143
00:05:23,019 --> 00:05:27,129
the best I'm gonna grab some more chose

144
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:29,589
as a setting powder and another natural

145
00:05:27,129 --> 00:05:31,449
sponge and just use this to bake my face

146
00:05:29,589 --> 00:05:33,159
to not only lock everything in place but

147
00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:35,349
also hopefully bring back a little bit

148
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:48,189
of my natural skin tone because this is

149
00:05:35,349 --> 00:05:49,089
a little spooky mokuba all right so

150
00:05:48,189 --> 00:05:50,259
while we're baking in the oven we're

151
00:05:49,089 --> 00:05:51,999
gonna move on to the next step which of

152
00:05:50,259 --> 00:05:53,949
course is going to be my eyebrows and

153
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:55,629
you guys know I usually live for a good

154
00:05:53,949 --> 00:05:58,149
eyebrow pencil but what I don't like

155
00:05:55,629 --> 00:05:59,319
using is brow powder so I'm gonna take a

156
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:01,329
break from the acrylics for a short

157
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:03,939
circuit and today I think I'm gonna use

158
00:06:01,329 --> 00:06:05,169
these watercolors just gonna grab the

159
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:07,419
little paintbrush that came in the set

160
00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:10,649
and dip into my little cup of water dip

161
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:12,129
into the brown shade which is very very

162
00:06:10,649 --> 00:06:14,110
warm

163
00:06:12,129 --> 00:06:17,769
oh god this could be bad I'm also gonna

164
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:19,209
grab some block two because that sounds

165
00:06:17,769 --> 00:06:20,319
scary okay here we go

166
00:06:19,209 --> 00:06:21,549
this could be good then I'm just gonna

167
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,649
apply it using an angled brush that I

168
00:06:21,549 --> 00:06:27,069

192
00:07:12,789 --> 00:07:17,229
second alternative so I'm just gonna go

193
00:07:15,249 --> 00:07:18,579
in and so I was like am and see what we

194
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:19,959
can come up with I guess I'm gonna go

195
00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:21,549
ahead and scrape all my colors in the

196
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:22,659
beginning to get the pigments ready for

197
00:07:21,549 --> 00:07:24,650
you so I'm first gonna show off with

198
00:07:22,659 --> 00:07:26,690
this yellow shade that I'm gonna use

199
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:28,610
I think decrease I'm gonna grab this

200
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:30,650
hole and shade then this red shade then

201
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:31,940
this cranberry shade that is purple

202
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,110
shade and then finally just a little bit

203
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:34,610
of the black all right this is what we

204
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:39,680
got going on let's see what we can come

205
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:41,210
up with oh there it is despite the fact

206
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,010
that these are literally raw segments

207
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:45,860
going onto my eyeball I'm actually

208
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:47,120
surprised at how not pigmented they are

209
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,800
and how much I actually have to layer

210
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,570
them up but I feel like we can

211
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,460
definitely make a some form of really

212
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:54,620
cute I look work with this I'm just

213
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:57,919
gonna layer in some red into the crease

214
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:59,030
oh that's penguin Ted okay we're getting

215
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,800
somewhere we're getting somewhere

216
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:02,720
I really want to do a sunset halo eye

217
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,310
with these colors it's literally one of

218
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,660
the hardest color combinations to do and

219
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:08,600
it also uses a lot of different colors

220
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:11,270
so it's a challenge next I'm gonna grab

221
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:14,180
this number six round blender watercolor

222
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:17,030
brush literally pencil brush use Coe

223
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:18,229
James 10% off morphe something you want

224
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:20,000
to tell us here I've definitely noticed

225
00:08:18,229 --> 00:08:22,039
that the best way to get color payoff is

226
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,680
to definitely pack the color in first

227
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:26,539
and then kind of blend it out later if

228
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,160
you go in and try to like layer up like

229
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:30,080
I would normally do eyeshadow it doesn't

230
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,550
really show up that much and obviously

231
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,930
when it comes to a sunset halo eye we

232
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:35,719
kind of need that pigmentation there so

233
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:36,740
definitely pack and then blend if you'd

234
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:38,630
ever be doing this I don't know why

235
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,740
you'd ever need this technique ever in

236
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:42,080
your entire life unless you're gonna get

237
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:44,120
ready using our supplies but I'm just

238
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,440
being the gurus that I am I want to go

239
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,510
ahead and cut out the center of this

240
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,620
crease and plop summit glitter and more

241
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:51,200
shadows on there so I'm just gonna grab

242
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:52,970
that rounded concealer brush once again

243
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,589
oh my god I literally love this brush

244
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:57,100

245
00:08:54,589 --> 00:09:11,939
to my regular collection

246
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:13,999
[Music]

247
00:09:11,939 --> 00:09:13,999
you

248
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:20,599
okay the one major downside to using

249
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:22,729
chalk pastels for your eyeshadow the

250
00:09:20,599 --> 00:09:24,409

00:09:24,409 --> 00:09:28,009
short now of course you guys know

253
00:09:25,579 --> 00:09:29,569
glitter unless it is cosmetic grade it

254
00:09:28,009 --> 00:09:31,039
should not be used on the eyes but you

255
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,359
know what most of these products

256
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:34,069
probably should not be use of on the eye

257
00:09:32,359 --> 00:09:36,829
so don't call this advice but I'm gonna

258
00:09:34,069 --> 00:09:37,879

331
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,790
a little bit disappointed by the

332
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:09,050
highlighter of course it looks really

333
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:11,600
really pretty literally is hitting it

334
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:12,920
like Hello love that but when the light

335
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,610
isn't hitting it it's definitely a way

336
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,600
to tart

337
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:15,740
this is the only shape they had

338
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,660

situation oh you're all doing just fine

347
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,380
Laos is certainly not least the one

348
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,850
thing we're missing as the Liberty Doo

349
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,960
Dah so for this look I feel like I would

350
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:37,520
do a red lip

351
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,050
I think it's so much very very lazy to

352
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,520
all the clothes we helped coming on so

353
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:43,660

crap I'm sure you guys let me know in

361
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:07,620
the comments but for me personally I

362
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:10,020
think I absolutely killed this and never

363
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:12,150
again do I ever want to hear anybody say

364
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:13,770
