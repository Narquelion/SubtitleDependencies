brows and some type of morphe I shadow

palette some type of highlighter and

38
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,060
then a nude lip like you guys feel me at

39
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,110
this point although I do love Tori

40
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,610
getting some creative looks it's been a

41
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,619
hot minute since I've tried some brand

42
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:33,210
new products all that being said I've

43
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:34,590
been saving up some PR packages from the

44
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,119
last few weeks some of my favorite

45
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,740
companies and I have a ton of products

46
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:39,240
that I cannot wait to show you guys so

47
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,409
let's get started

48
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,759
as always I'm just probably my face

49
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:43,229
using my benefit Porefessional primer

50
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,640
you guys know this is like my

51
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:46,320
ride-or-die primer and I probably will

52
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,299
honestly never switched up unless I find

53
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,170
something better skin is always been

54
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:50,729
something that it's been like a major

55
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:52,710
problem area for me in my life I used to

56
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:54,630
have really bad acne but Lily my skin

57
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:56,520
has been treating me so what's so well

58
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:59,189
and I am so frickin happy about it so

59
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,659
yeah purple it is I actually just got a

60
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:01,890
facial a few days ago for the first time

61
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:03,210
when they did like the extractions where

62
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,799
they said they're like pop everything

63
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:06,270
out of your nose I was laughing so hard

64
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,900
because the only thought right through

65
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,340
her head was

66
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,320
you could probably pop all the

67
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,780
blackheads on my nose and literally

68
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,760
repackage all the gunk into a benefit

69
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,100
Porefessional primer because that's all

70
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,330
I ever felt my frickin nose purple and a

71
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,820
sheet on these might make up for ever

72
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:22,470
ultra HD sick and the shade of Y at 325

73
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:24,150
once again this is one of those products

74
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:26,370
that is my Holy Grail and will not

75
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:27,630
change and there was no what foundations

76
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:30,210
than any of the packages that I receive

77
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:31,260
so can't switch anything up I'm so

78
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,340
freaking excited because you know all

79
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,200
the sisters are going with makeup

80
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,300
forever tight to a kailani concert here

81
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,220
in Los Angeles and I absolutely love her

82
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:40,860
and her music I think she's so talented

83
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,210
and just so like cool in general we

84
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,290
actually just got a tux earlier thinking

85
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,370
we're gonna get to hang out with her

86
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:46,500
before the show something which is

87
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:48,630
literally is so dope so I am getting

88
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,800
ready for that right now I'm praying

89
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:51,270
that all these products that I'm trying

90
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,320
on today we're gonna favor because this

91
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,790
is gonna be the look that I'm wearing

92
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,010
tonight y'all know that that self he's

93
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:57,540
gonna be iconic so hopefully we can pull

94
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:59,070
this off all right so I just went ahead

95
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,330
and applied my shape tape concealer in

96
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:01,920
the shade light and then blended it out

97
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:03,900
as usual is my damn Beauty Blender and

98
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,720
now the next step is ways to set my face

99
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:09,000
so for today I am using a new setting

100
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,320
powder and this is the RCM a no color

101
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,760
powder you may have seen this before

102
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,620
because I know a lot of people talk

103
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,360
about and abused it if you've used it I

104
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,860
apologize this is not your first

105
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,150
impressions as my first impressions and

106
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,860
I have never tried this before so I'm

107
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,970
gonna use it today you guys know that

108
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,290
setting powder is a little bit of a

109
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:24,420
touchy subject for me so I'm actually

110
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:25,650
super nervous to try a new one but I've

111
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,420
heard a lot of good reviews so let's go

112
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:29,010
ahead and give it a try so first light

113
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,480
is going on really really nicely it

114
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,890
definitely is like pretty finely milled

115
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,290
so that's good because we don't get

116
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:35,370
those like ugly like splotches that

117
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:37,770
sometimes it catches on to the

118
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:40,110
foundation but I'm gonna keep putting it

119
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:41,220
on and see when I think up deep and it's

120
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:42,540
definitely a really good job of like

121
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,100
mattifying and setting everything in

122
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:46,200
place as you can see my nose definitely

123
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:48,420
looks locked right and then which is

124
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,880
great because lord knows that my nose

125
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,930
loves to slip and slide around I'm also

126
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,430
gonna place a little bit of this right

127
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,570
in the center of my forehead just to set

128
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:56,790
that area in place and make sure I don't

129
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:59,700
get any creases because I do tend to

130
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:01,739
crease up there a lot and then lightly

131
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,750
just a but some excess powder on that

132
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:05,220
way face lately I actually have not been

133
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,050
setting my entire face I've been going

134
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,819
for more of the like a dewy skin a

135
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,680
foundation

136
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:11,180
I've honestly been loving it here loss

137
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,030
and doesn't this literally it's so

138
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:15,530
freakin hot I've had my AC blasting all

139
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,820
morning and all night last night and

140
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,470
it's still it's like a million degrees

141
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:21,049
in here which is very very rude and

142
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:22,639
homophobic because I'm about to melt but

143
00:04:21,049 --> 00:04:24,919
we're gonna make it work I'm gonna suck

144
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,090
it up but yeah so I haven't been setting

145
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:28,580
my entire face and I've been living for

146
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:29,840
the dewy look but that depends on your

147
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,190
skin type and how it you like wearing

148
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,000
your makeup if you want to set your

149
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:34,250
makeup and if you're someone who

150
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,050
definitely gets oily definitely a pack

151
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:37,820
on the powder girl you do you so now

152
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:39,259

00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,590
for $75 that the makeup shock which is

185
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:33,349
definitely a little pricey for a brush

186
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:35,030
that but y'all know me of course every

187
00:05:33,349 --> 00:05:36,620
staudte that I did get a coupon code so

188
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:37,909
you guys can now use code chance or

189
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,560
twenty percent or purchase at the makeup

190
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:42,139
shock that brings the price of this down

191
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,610
to Rome $60 and divided by nine that's

192
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:45,289
just over six dollars per brush so

193
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:47,180
definitely not too bad of a deal

194
00:05:45,289 --> 00:05:48,409
so shut off leather we grab the T 27

195
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,729
brush from the brush set and then dip

196
00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:51,469
into my Kat Von D shade and light

197
00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:53,090
palette into this middle shade and I'm

198
00:05:51,469 --> 00:05:54,710
going to contour and chisel out my face

199
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:55,659
oh my god the bristles on these are so

200
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:58,400
soft

201
00:05:55,659 --> 00:06:00,050
Wow legend went off we got a contour out

202
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,180
that jaw light as well and snatch her

203
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:04,070
right up and we definitely are not gonna

204
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,389
miss out on this for yet contour Lord

205
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:06,770
and nose and now that I don't have a

206
00:06:05,389 --> 00:06:08,270
baseball hat to cover half of this

207
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:09,949
region we're gonna need to use that

208
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,870
contour to turn this five head back into

209
00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:12,970
around a

210
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:14,260
three head I'm then gonna grab the t-84

211
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:15,100
brush in that same shade from the shade

212
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:17,050
and light palette and I'm going to

213
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:19,870
contour out my nose oh my god that

214
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:23,139
actually lay down the color so nicely my

215
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:25,300
luck see 182 brush is shaking I'm gonna

216
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:27,639
actually really like this brush yes T 94

217
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:29,350
you better work before we move onto

218
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:30,760
baking I'm gonna quickly grab my tea 17

219
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:32,889
also from the brush set and dip into a

220
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:34,870
Mac peaches blush and just put a light

221
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:36,430
wash of color on at the cheekbones okay

222
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:39,729
maybe that wasn't exactly the best brush

223
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:41,199
for a light to wash the color but it'll

224
00:06:39,729 --> 00:06:43,150
do alright so I'm gonna grab my Beauty

225
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,280
Blender and dip right back into that RCA

226
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:47,620
and no color powder and I'm going to be

227
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,479
my face so I'm gonna my nose contour as

228
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:50,710
always even though the powder is trims

229
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:52,570
looser I'm really hoping that because

230
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:54,010
it's white it's still a bright enough

231
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:56,560
everything a little bit and if it does

232
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:57,940
were about to look so snatch in a few

233
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,490
minutes and I was super excited to see

234
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:01,870
how this rubs off alright so while I was

235
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:03,430
in the oven baking ideas quickly went

236
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:05,919
ahead into my brows off-camera save some

237
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:07,690
time same exact process as always no new

238
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,610
products or first impressions so now

239
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:11,139
that it's been a long really time we're

240
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:12,610
gonna go ahead and we're going to wipe

241
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:14,590
this bake off and see how this powder

242
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:16,330
did okay so I was definitely right the

243
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:17,740
thought that it is white definitely did

244
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:19,990
leave a little bit of a highlighted look

245
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:21,729
but I really really like that that's

246
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:23,650
exactly what I look for in a setting

247
00:07:21,729 --> 00:07:24,880
powder I really like when I bake my face

248
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:26,260
and it like really brings back those

249
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,970
highlights so I need help there very

250
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:32,820
ready to find contour highlight like

251
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:36,070
very very full focus 360 full glam

252
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:37,750
snatch that was stupid I apologize so

253
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:39,099
you know what I mean looking up close my

254
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,750
skin definitely does a little bit more

255
00:07:39,099 --> 00:07:42,940
porous than usual especially in like the

256
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:44,380
t-zone area right up in here that's

257
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,610
where ports are usually the worst but it

258
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,200
definitely doesn't look as good as it

259
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:49,180
normally does today I'm not sure if

260
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,099
that's the powder or my skin in general

261
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:52,240
not having a good skin day but I

262
00:07:51,099 --> 00:07:53,710
definitely want to keep using this

263
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,090
powder because they like how it looks so

264
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:56,680
far and I will keep you guys posted at

265
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:58,360
for sure alright so I already went ahead

266
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,039
and prime my eyelids using my shape tape

267
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,229
concealer and then some more RC made no

268
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:03,729
color powder as usual and now we're

269
00:08:02,229 --> 00:08:06,190
going to move on to the eyes and this is

270
00:08:03,729 --> 00:08:07,750
what I was so so so excited for and that

271
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:09,669
is the Jacqueline Bo collaboration with

272
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,690
morphe nothing this was actually

273
00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:12,669
released I can actually smell a little

274
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:14,530
bit of a secret for you bodies but a

275
00:08:12,669 --> 00:08:16,090
long long long time ago Jacqueline

276
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:17,169
actually showed me the mock-up for this

277
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:18,849
palette on FaceTime

278
00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:19,580
she showed me like one of the first

279
00:08:18,849 --> 00:08:21,949
trial region

280
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:24,699
honestly it has changed so much since

281
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:27,169
then but it is just so beyond beautiful

282
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:28,250
Joplin if you are watching us I freaking

283
00:08:27,169 --> 00:08:29,270
love you so much

284
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,469
I don't know if any of you guys know

285
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:32,659
this because the only tour of the story

286
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:34,070
like once or twice but Jonathan Hills

287
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:35,839
actually like the reason I started doing

288
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:37,219
makeup in the first place she's holding

289
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,320
my inspiration I would stay up all night

290
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:40,729
watching her YouTube videos I just think

291
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,010
she's just like the most boss ass [ __ ]

292
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:45,019
ever I love her and I respect her so

293
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:47,029
much and obviously you guys know I love

294
00:08:45,019 --> 00:08:48,140
morphe as well so this club was just

295
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:49,190
made in heaven and if you know

296
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:51,589
Jacqueline you know that this is

297
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:54,350
literally her in a frickin a palette

298
00:08:51,589 --> 00:08:56,149
version so this palette comes 235 custom

299
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:57,649
formulated shades they are not the

300
00:08:56,149 --> 00:08:59,089
everyday morphe formula and I have not

301
00:08:57,649 --> 00:09:00,860
washed them yet but I've seen other

302
00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:02,060
people I know that these are gonna be

303
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:03,529
good but I'm gonna save my opinions

304
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,940
until I actually put them on my face

305
00:09:03,529 --> 00:09:06,980
that being said this palette retails for

306
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:09,110
$35 so it is a little bit steeper than

307
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:12,230
morphine as usual $22 a palette but it's

308
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:14,360
living 35 amazing shades for $35 you

309
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:15,769
really really it cannot be that this

310
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,670
palette won't just in a few days so you

311
00:09:15,769 --> 00:09:18,410

318
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:28,519
that has Jacqueline's code I'll put it

319
00:09:27,019 --> 00:09:29,959
right down here on the screen go show

320
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:31,550
her some love this palette is literally

321
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:33,170
everything and I'm so pumped to put it

322
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:34,459
on my face right now I'm first gonna

323
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:36,529
start by grabbing the shade creamsicle

324
00:09:34,459 --> 00:09:38,300
on my makeup shot t70 brush and I'm just

325
00:09:36,529 --> 00:09:43,160
going to buff this right into the crease

326
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:44,449
oh my god that's been dead okay Jonathan

327
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,769
I see use the sir

328
00:09:44,449 --> 00:09:47,600
I'm next thing to grab the shade hunt on

329
00:09:45,769 --> 00:09:49,160
my makeup shock at44 brush and I'm going

330
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,750
to buff this right into the crease

331
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:54,079
because I'm going to be transitioning

332
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:55,279
from like yellow to orange to a red oh

333
00:09:54,079 --> 00:09:58,100
my god these colors are literally

334
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,449
blending it so beautifully I'm kind of

335
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,610
stuck to the coil right now I'm Mexican

336
00:09:59,449 --> 00:10:02,990
MIT 63 brush and dip into the shade at

337
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:04,940
Jack's and I'm going to put this right

338
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:06,829
in that crease for a little pop of red

339
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:08,300
oh yeah then we can knock it over how

340
00:10:06,829 --> 00:10:09,870
pigmented these shadows are that was

341
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:13,410
living with one dip into the pan

342
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:15,120
we got ya like hi okay I'm gonna dip

343
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:16,950
back into Hunt's with that t-44a brush

344
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,780
and just buff over those edges I was not

345
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:20,580
anticipating that much pigmentation so

346
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:22,350
now we need to blend her out or else

347
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:24,030
this is gonna get real messy real fast

348
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:24,930
once all those three colors are on there

349
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:26,370
as well I'm gonna dip back into

350
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:28,290
creamsicle and just go over those edges

351
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:30,090
make sure they are super blended out and

352
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:31,560
their transitions are all smooth I

353
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:33,600
really want to do a pop of blue on the

354
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,220
eye so with that same exact e63 brush

355
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,350
I'm actually gonna dip into the shade of

356
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:38,970
royalty which is a metallic purple shade

357
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:40,320
in this palette but I'm gonna use this

358
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,700
as kind of a transition shade between

359
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,650
the metallic blue that's gonna go on the

360
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,210
lid and the cranberry color that I just

361
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:46,320
might in the crease and once it's all on

362
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:47,910
there I'm gonna go back into the same

363
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,170

364
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:51,480
red shade and just bring back the

365
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:53,040
cranberry color I'm gonna grab my t79

366
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,440
brush and didn't do the shade at work

367
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,030
which is this metallic blue shade I am

368
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,100
so excited for this and I'm gonna pop

369
00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:01,020
her right onto the lid oh my god my

370
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:03,360
brush Libya is not even wet either miss

371
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:04,770
Hill suddenly my wig just got ripped off

372
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,350
and flew all the way from Los Angels to

373
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:08,970
wherever you are in Florida these are so

374
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:10,380
good I know everybody's gonna say I'm

375
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:12,180
sucking up tomorrow because I always do

376
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:13,800
but honestly these shadows are like so

377
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:15,000
good I genuinely would not expect

378
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,070
anything less than perfect for

379
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,450
Jacqueline and so far that is exactly

380
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:19,140
what I'm seeing I'm gonna go back in

381
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,610
with Torque you know what I'm gonna

382
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:22,620
surprise my brushes in the all-nighter

383
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:24,750
and I'm just gonna lay this on top again

384
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:27,570
and see how like actual metallic we can

385
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:29,010
get it oh my god these are literally

386
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:30,090
beautiful okay I think I want to show

387
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:31,410
this into a little bit of a halo eye

388
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:33,450
situation so I'm gonna grab the same

389
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:34,590
exact brush and dip into the slightest

390
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:36,600
bit of a pool party

391
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:37,710
once again gonna spritz that brush that

392
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,360
I'm just gonna layer that right on the

393
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:40,590
center of the lid and see how that looks

394
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,850
- I'm a little bit love of how this

395
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:44,070
looks so far so I guess we're going to

396
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:45,660
move on to the lower lash line now so

397
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:48,720
I'm gonna start off using the exact same

398
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:53,520
shade of torque on the same t79 brush

399
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:55,080
and I'm going to above this in two and

400
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,320
then going to grab a double pool party

401
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,450
and Papa in the center

402
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,880
once again I never got that t44 brush

403
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:02,200
one last time and dip into Jax and I'm

404
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,760
just going to blend all those editors

405
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,170
and connect it back up to the upper lash

406
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,850
line to highlight the inner corners I'm

407
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:08,290
gonna go to my Sigma e30 brush and dip

408
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:10,240
into the shade beam which is this

409
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:12,490
beautiful bright house highlighting

410
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,530
shade and I'm going to pop that right in

411
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:16,450
there oh wow before I move on to the

412
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:18,490
lashes I describe my Mac reflex teal

413
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:20,320
because I want the center of the lid to

414
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:22,810
really really really pop so I'm just

415
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,440
gonna grab my tee at 79 brush one last

416
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:25,660
time

417
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,820
dip into just the slightest little bit

418
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:30,570
of it and I'm going to stretch my brush

419
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:32,710
then I'm just going to hop her on there

420
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:34,120
everything that is there gosh that'll

421
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,620
all complete for laughs today I'm gonna

422
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,390
pop on the makeup shock lashes in the

423
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:39,370
style Dubai I'm having a really good

424
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:41,080
makeup day today and I'm honestly it

425
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:42,340
really and then of course I'm gonna use

426
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,410
my roller lash mascara just to blend

427
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:45,850
together the fake lashes with the real

428
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:48,490
ones all right sisters that is when I

429
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:50,740
all complete I'm honestly hoping this

430
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:52,540
look so much so far it is definitely a

431
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:54,070
good makeup day so it's sister James is

432
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,240
happy I'm gonna go ahead and do the

433
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:56,650
other one off-camera quickly and I'll be

434
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,280
right back to finish off the rest of the

435
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,510
face

436
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,460
alright guys I am back with both eyes

437
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:02,260
all complete I wiped off the crusty

438
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:03,940
foundation on my lips brush my teeth to

439
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:06,460
get ready to go for tonight's event and

440
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,810
now let's move on with the glow for

441
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:11,830
highlighter said I were using the Wet n

442
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:13,330
Wild mega glow highlighting powder I am

443
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:15,250
so freaking excited because I've heard

444
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:16,810
so many great things about these but

445
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,460
they're literally still don't everywhere

446
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:20,020
I've looked for them so many times that

447
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:21,400
my different drugstores you guys know

448
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,450
cried drugstore makeup girl a few weeks

449
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,970
ago I was talking about wanting to use

450
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:26,590
these but they were nowhere to be found

451
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:28,060
so I finally got this one today I

452
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:30,010
actually has a matter of fact wet and

453
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:31,480
wild just let me a huge PR package with

454
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,890
a ton of their products so definitely

455
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,240
give this video a big thumbs up down

456
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:36,040
below if you want me to do a full face

457
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,020
using only well products because I would

458
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,940
definitely be down definitely not as

459
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:41,920
blinding as I was expecting but not bad

460
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:44,650
to formula that's like rubbing my brush

461
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,150
and it feels extremely soft which is

462
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:48,070
good because that means that the texture

463
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:49,630
of your natural face won't show as much

464
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:51,280
because I know highly a lot of times

465
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:52,570
accentuate texture especially for me

466
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,220
because they have a lot of pimples in my

467
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:56,500
highlight region for some annoying ass

468
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:57,790
reason but the form of this feels really

469
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,050
really good this highlighter is

470
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:00,160
definitely a really really pretty and I

471
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:02,650
know this is drugstore price I think

472
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,480
this is like $6 so honestly for $6 it's

473
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:06,040
really really not bad I'm just being

474
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,550
dramatic here but definitely not as a

475
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,200
blonde

476
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:09,640
as I was expecting it to be I'm probably

477
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,860
gonna end up lying this with like my

478
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:13,690
makeup forever 13 pigment or my Anasazi

479
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:15,850
so Hollywood just to be like blinding

480
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:17,620
people left and right but definitely so

481
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:18,850
beautiful for the price I said this how

482
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:20,020
that is beautiful and I did not lie and

483
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:22,270
it's definitely beautiful on the

484
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:23,800
cheekbones but for the nose contour haha

485
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:25,720
for some reason even though this valley

486
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,340
is literally super super light it is

487
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,050
apparently too dark for my skin tone

488
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:30,880
because when I'm not hitting the light

489
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:32,500
like right there you can see it's not

490
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,120
reflecting light so it looks a little

491
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,740
bit darker than my nose contour which

492
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,420
completely ruins the effect which is so

493
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:39,010
frustrating so I'm just gonna layer over

494
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:40,870
top the makeup upper 13 right on that

495
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:43,120
area because lord knows that that is

496
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:44,800
that blinding and will hopefully fix

497
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,260
this oh great that literally just made

498
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,310
it 20 times worse I think that's

499
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,140
probably a message from somebody up

500
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:51,400
above saying James stop trying to make

501
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,720
your nose look 20 time sorrow that

502
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,340
actually is because sister you're not

503
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,570
fooling anybody are this is the last

504
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:57,040
step of this makeup show us obviously

534
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:51,130
back interview all the products that we

535
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,500
tried today the first time being the are

536
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:55,000
CMA no color powder this definitely did

537
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,070
a really good job of baking the face and

538
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,020
lightening it up I loved the effect that

539
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:01,030
it gave but it definitely did make my

540
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,810
pores and texture look not the best and

541
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:03,490
it's never looked

542
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:04,870
usually the alarm RCA powder doesn't

543
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:06,010
really get up absolutely everything out

544
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:07,780
so I definitely going to give this

545
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:10,030
another shot and see if it's just the

546
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:12,250
powder or if it is just my skin don't

547
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:14,320
know it looks pretty but I've seen it

548
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:15,370
look better so I'm quite sure to at

549
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,410
least all in the fence with this one

550
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:18,400
but did a decent job for today that's

551
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:20,080
what the makeup stock brushes they're

552
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,460
definitely a big hit for me you guys

553
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,720
know that I'm very very loyal to morphe

554
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:24,310
and the brushes don't absolutely love

555
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,300
them but I have to support my best

556
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:26,950
friend in the entire world

557
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:28,300
Hayes's I am so freaking proud of you

558
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:29,650
and you guys need to go check out this

559
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,779
brush set as soon as it launches and

560
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:33,400
remember Co James gets you 20% off

561
00:16:31,779 --> 00:16:34,660
actually the next item on the list you

562
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,000
already know how I feel about miss [ __ ]

563
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:39,190
over here this pillow is literally

564
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,630
everything I am just so beyond check out

565
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:42,339
the quality and how they blended and

566
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:44,920
just the pigmentation in general this

567
00:16:42,339 --> 00:16:46,720
palette is a hundred percent a win as I

568
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,520
said before I am so beyond proud of

569
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,230
sister Jacqueline she is the person who

570
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,850
single-handedly got me into the beauty

571
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:53,710
industry I've always looked up to her

572
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:55,210
and now it is literally so freakin crazy

573
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:57,130
and cool to me that I'm able to call her

574
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:58,810
one of my best friends so proud of you

575
00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:00,550
as I said before coach James gave you

576
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:02,290
10% off when it launches or if you want

577
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:03,790
a double support sister chocolate use

578
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:05,500
coat a jacket a cat your check out as

579
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:07,449
well next up on the list was the Wet n

580
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:09,400
Wild highlighting powder and I wanted to

581
00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:11,050
love this so so so so bad but I think

582
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,300
this is gonna be my one fail of this

583
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:14,709
video it looks so beautiful on the

584
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,240
cheeks I'm like the brow bone and the

585
00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:18,309
upper forehead region but on the nose

586
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,959
contour it is really not doing it

587
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:21,699
justice it definitely is a little bit

588
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:23,439
too dark for a skin which is so strange

589
00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:25,209
because this is already a super super

590
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,410
light highlighter but it's giving us

591
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:28,329
that great pass when the light isn't

592
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:30,309
hitting it so this is gonna be a fail

593
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:31,510
for me but like I said before definitely

594
00:17:30,309 --> 00:17:32,830
give this video a big thumbs up if you

595
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:34,360
want to see a full face using all wet

596
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:35,980
and wild products because I do have a

597
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,660
full collection now that I would love to

598
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:39,490
try out for you guys and last but

599
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:41,650
certainly not least was the jus a new

600
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:44,590
ultra penguin lip glosses and these are

601
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:45,790
so Bob I used to shade PCH on my look

602
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:47,410
today at once again layer over that

603
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:49,300
color pop gloss but I absolutely love

604
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:50,770
how it looks the formula is really

605
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:52,300
really nice I know a lot of glosses

606
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:54,730
oftentimes feel really really tacky or

607
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:56,020
sticky when I go like this my lip lick

608
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:58,750
sticks together but this wears

609
00:17:56,020 --> 00:18:00,340
beautifully it's lightweight it's simple

610
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:02,290
it's nice and I love the color so this

611
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:03,610
is definitely a win up for me alright

612
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,960
