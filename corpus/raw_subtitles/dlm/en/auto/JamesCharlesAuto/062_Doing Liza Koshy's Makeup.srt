00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:44,380
these amazing things and put on these

138
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,970
different hats and stuff and it was so

139
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:47,320
fun I just wanted to work with other

140
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,610
people I've been working in my living

141
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:51,190
room and just like screaming at myself

142
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:52,900
for past like two two-and-a-half three

143
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:54,070
years right and I just wanted to work

144
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,600
with others like I do everything by

145
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:57,370
myself I don't I don't know that cuz

146
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,080
don't really like open up about it but I

147
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:00,760
I do everything on my own so I write

148
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,040
everything and then I shoot everything

149
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,930
and I charge my own camera don't let

150
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:07,720
people behind the camera for me at all

151
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:09,010

152
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,420

153
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:11,890
wanted to work with other people and you

154
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:14,350
know I got so excited by that when I

155
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:16,150
started working with them like I just I

156
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:17,980
fell in love with the whole process and

157
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:21,190
I realized that it could be not lonely

158
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:22,570
and yeah I got excited by that so then I

159
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:24,520
felt bad I she didn't have enough time

160
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:26,080
to create on my youtube channel and

161
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:29,030
beyond like

162
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:31,540
yeah baby one thing I sister sold my

163
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:34,100
soul what she has I am good buy my merch

164
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:36,050
no bikes I didn't have time for at all

165
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:37,730
and then I also just I felt really alone

166
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:40,040
doing it all to your own so like wanted

167
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:41,390
to have fun again hmm and find like why

168
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,590
passion again I take care of mental

169
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:45,080
health and I feel like you could start

170
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:47,960
to tell like in my videos that I just I

171
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:49,820
lost like my passion for it hmm I just

172
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:52,370
seemed less excited and so I didn't want

173
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:54,710
to force anything anymore but I think

174
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:56,750
it's really important to yeah you got a

175
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:58,610
you've got a prioritizing method I think

176
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,770
that's been a big thing on YouTube

177
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:02,810
especially this year which chains videos

178
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:04,010
everybody's like prioritizing you know

179
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:05,180
taking care of your anxiety or

180
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:06,830
depression or whatever

181
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,940
buddy has their demons right I

182
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:09,170
definitely gotta take a few breaks over

yeah so like I know what it feels like

225
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:20,150
to get in a rut and not know what to

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,950
film literally like one of the most like

227
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:23,940
detrimental feelings ever yeah look it's

00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:27,480
that I'm not gonna creative read that's

230
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:29,280

232
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,510

just like can be a really dark place

253
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,310
sometimes and like no matter what your

254
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,990

255
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:28,020
consistently super positive I'm just

all of this what's the driving force

262
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:48,480
behind everything to look for it

like challenging myself I just like

267
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:57,210
making people happy to like I grew up

268
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:58,320
getting bullied a lot by different kids

269
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:00,270
that I've always had a very very thick

270
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,530
skin so I've always been able to kind of

271
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:03,870
deal with it but I know so many kids

272
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:04,950

273
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,270

00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:08,250
people can go just to laugh and have a

275
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:10,320
good time and there may be a little bit

I could erect I've never had my makeup

308
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:23,880
done by anybody in the beauty community

309
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:26,700
which by the way you guys are amazing

310
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:28,830
your party was so fun oh do I get I'm

311
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,630
glad I wasn't excited that you showed up

312
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:32,130
this foundations matching pretty good so

313
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:33,420
far okay so since I do my own makeup

314
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:35,040
literally all the time and I don't

315
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:36,690
really do that many collabs either I

316
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,980
have never gotten the chance to do a

317
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:40,200
woman of color on my youtube channel

318
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:42,540

320
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,750
but also really nervous too because the

321
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:47,190
undertones Furley people of color versus

322
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,990
white yeah it's very different

323
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:50,670
no it's very tough and like I've always

324
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:52,350
had like a purpley hue whenever someone

325
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:55,290
does my makeup like I'm sad sometimes no

326
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:57,450
shake no shake but I've always had like

327
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:59,070
a purple kind of like undertone but I

328
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:01,530
have a naturally red or yellow under

329
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:03,060
yeah yeah great guys today yes but yeah

330
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:05,520

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,630
skin tone so I'm not really going to use

364
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,770
a more like yellow shade when it comes

365
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:24,450
to like a setting your under eyes are

366
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:25,770
going over top of it but I don't really

367
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:27,600
have any of my collection just because I

368
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:29,250
come over I get PR packages I usually

369
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,870
give away all of my deeper skin tone

370
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,579
complexion products to my assistant or

371
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:34,020
other makeup artists that work around me

372
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:35,010
in my industry because I'm not going to

373
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,959
get any you some of them and I'd rather

374
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:38,040
have them go to people that need them I

375
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,020
guess so much makeup on an everyday

376
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,459
basis and I'll never know yes I would so

377
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,779
much rather like a donate it the woman

378
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:44,190
shelters are give us to like morning

379
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:45,779
artists who I know need it or can't

380
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,800
afford it yes I'm not ever going to do

381
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:52,620
that there's no point in sitting in my

382
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:54,390
closet you're incredibly generous by the

383
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:55,920
way why nice to give back to just like

384
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:57,950

385
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,779

387
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:03,019
uplifting of other Creators and like

like those really fun oh thank you yeah

390
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,850
I like made me want to become a makeup

391
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,139
artist so that I can get attacking

392
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:12,350
mm-hmm

393
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:15,800
do you want kids absolutely not no no

00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:17,560
really no I feel like just your like

395
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:30,620
makeup looks on your children would be

396
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:31,940
great channel baby makeup okay so one

397
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,560
thing that I talk about my channel a lot

398
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:37,010
of my subscribers like hear me talk

399
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:38,120
about at least I think so oh yeah the

400
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:39,560
one thing that I've discussed quite a

401
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,940
lot is like the difference between

402
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,130
traditional media celebrities and

403
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:44,570
YouTube additional media announcers and

404
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:45,889
huge disconnect in the space yeah

405
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:47,540
and I feel like you're one of the very

406
00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:50,360
few craters who's done a really great

407
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:52,880
job at kind of bringing their brand to

408
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,199
more traditional media so when I was

409
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,639
like how do you feel about that like it

410
00:14:54,199 --> 00:14:58,570
- you have like what are you planning

411
00:14:55,639 --> 00:15:01,670
for your own future and not like whoa

412
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:03,410
see I don't plan that's my you know I

413
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:05,329
haven't uploaded but like I think you

414
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:06,470
don't like actually like know exactly

415
00:15:05,329 --> 00:15:07,940
what I'm doing I'm kind of just like

416
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:09,470
always just kind of like gone with the

417
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,329
flow you're honest with like traditional

418
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:14,779
and digital I feel like there's been

419
00:15:11,329 --> 00:15:16,490
like a nice like blurred line now like

420
00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:19,339
Ray Smith is doing YouTube yeah that's

421
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:20,810
crazy yes that's so cool the fact that

422
00:15:19,339 --> 00:15:22,250
like a traditional celebrity is like

423
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:24,560
starting to you like dabble in like

424
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:26,510
creating and on social media and they're

425
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,600
willing to allow their life to be put

426
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:29,399
out there more and

427
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,680
and be more vulnerable by sharing their

428
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:35,490
experience it's like even just like Jada

429
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:37,560

00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:45,810

434
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:47,279

444
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,569

like meet your idols but uh thank you

513
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:44,790
for what they've done for you yes and

514
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,680
there were so many like comics and stuff

515
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:48,150
that I like I did say but obviously it's

516
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,890
an interview and they wanted like a

517
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:51,120
little side commentary you don't make

518
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:52,830
they cut out of video so you don't even

519
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,669
get to see the whole thing but like it

520
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:58,730
was such an honor

521
00:18:54,669 --> 00:19:01,929
that was my like one of my teeth

522
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:05,510
Pacific now moments yeah yeah because I

523
00:19:01,929 --> 00:19:07,820
was chewed out online for what I was

524
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:09,860
wearing and how I looked and like that

525
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:13,100
was a big like breaking point for me

526
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:16,340
because I have never like handled like a

527
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:18,169
scanner yeah before and so I was like it

528
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:20,270
was it was not it was tough I mean yeah

529
00:19:18,169 --> 00:19:22,700
definitely it can be challenging to deal

530
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:24,559
with for me but I wish like I like

531
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:26,150
watched your video the other day of your

532
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,340
flashback Mary like for the first time

533
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:29,450
I'm really a fan I watched it and I was

534
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:32,030
like wow I wish I would have done

535
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:34,730
something like this like comedic Lee

536
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:36,860
address it and like make light of it

537
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:39,890
because it is it's like it's everything

538
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:42,740
has its time and always passing and you

539
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:44,000
know things come and go and just kind of

540
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:46,039
move on but it was like a step in

541
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,140
traditional media yeah so that was like

542
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:49,400
that was scary yeah I'm really glad I

543
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:53,870
did it I try to do things that scare me

544
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:55,159
I'm taking the yellow seed bead I'm

545
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:56,990
gonna grab that same pain and I'm

546
00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:59,510
gonna use this to cut out your crease so

547
00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:00,830
I can layer on the yellow I'm basically

548
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:03,740
gonna pack the same colors that I put on

549
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:05,210
why this crease into the lid now as well

550
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:06,890
just in the same ordering staying that

551
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:08,659
way the same brush is turning off with

552
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:10,250
love that to blend into the purple I'm

553
00:20:08,659 --> 00:20:11,600
going in a little bit of you're kidding

554
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:15,590
that's okay your lower last night now

555
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:17,360
and it's gonna pop some purple so I'm

556
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:19,100
just packing socialblade right over top

557
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,200
everybody in the inner corner that

558
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:25,730
doesn't ever check central blade that is

559
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,890
a total lie no you know I've checked it

560
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:30,049
once before

561
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:31,909
uh-huh checked it once a day

562
00:20:30,049 --> 00:20:33,980
no but I used to look at it when I

563
00:20:31,909 --> 00:20:36,049
started like growing I guess but then I

564
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:37,940
just felt that it like wasn't good for

565
00:20:36,049 --> 00:20:39,320
me to like look at that kind of stuff so

566
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:40,429
I just like stopped I could definitely

567
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,650
get toxic

568
00:20:40,429 --> 00:20:44,270
