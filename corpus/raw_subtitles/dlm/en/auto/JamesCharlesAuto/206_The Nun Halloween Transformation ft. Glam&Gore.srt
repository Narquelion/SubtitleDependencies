60
00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:53,680
downstairs in the kitchen in a second

61
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:11,810
okay so what are we doing with this hot

62
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:14,329
cup of water and these disgusting so

63
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:16,910
we're pouring Kalamata lastik into hot

64
00:03:14,329 --> 00:03:18,620
water okay if you watch it us it's a lot

65
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:20,959
like your mug see what's happening

66
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:23,359
that's oh yeah Wow it's disappearing

67
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,190
what the how does that even work it

68
00:03:23,359 --> 00:03:34,099
turns clear when it's fully warmed and

69
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:37,069
then we're gonna oh my god I saw what ok

70
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:38,599
so then once it's still hot you can bend

71
00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:40,639
it like that you push it in there and

72
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:43,069
then your job and you're going to gently

73
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:45,139
push this against your teeth and then

74
00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:46,459
hold it there for about a minute and the

75
00:03:45,139 --> 00:03:47,510
plastics gonna start the hardener on

76
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:48,889
your teeth we might need to do this a

77
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:50,250
couple times because it's a little

78
00:03:48,889 --> 00:03:51,510
finicky to get the mold

79
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,740
right but once it's just right they just

80
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,970
pop right in they're gonna do the same

81
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:59,340
thing to the bottom one where you just

82
00:03:53,970 --> 00:04:00,570
mold it to the arch already fixed we

83
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,850
were back and the teeth are all molded

84
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:07,800
20s we show them or so we wear the end

85
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:10,230
yes okay oh okay great so um I get let's

86
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:12,810
are our next steps I guess okay the next

87
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:13,890
step is to get rid of these eyebrows

88
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:16,560
yeah okay great

89
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:19,140
oh my God my poor disgust Ahab I like it

90
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,090
it's dad so you can obviously cover your

91
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:23,760
brows the old-fashioned way with the

92
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:25,560
glue stick and the stuff or you can use

93
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:28,440
FX brow covers which are just little

94
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,060
pieces of foam latex glue it right on

95
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,530
top of your brow okay all these are just

96
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,270
gonna use a pros-aide then yeah I

97
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:34,800
already spilt sit on the table you done

98
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:36,210
I've always had a major infatuation with

99
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,940
special effects makeup I think it is so

100
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:41,760
cool I know the basics I'm not an expert

101
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:42,780
in any way shape or form but I can get

102
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,330
to a finished product that looks

103
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:46,980
possible passable is what we yeah yeah

104
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:48,780
for sure it's definitely all I aim for

105
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:50,580
it okay well your I would say your a

106
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:53,250
little bit better than possible if I

107
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,930
judging based on you were fooled you

108
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,340
good that's like what movie horror

109
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:58,800
movies could load up a paper topic in

110
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:00,960
the entire world to discuss and I don't

111
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,400
talk about a very often because most

112
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,140
people I feel like don't like horror

113
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,120
movies which is really sad what are your

114
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:07,380
top favorites because I have mine and I

115
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,479
have my list memorize what are your

116
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,979
favorites as far as classics go I love

117
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:13,169
The Exorcist I think that a lot of

118
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:15,660
people think that it's like silly now

119
00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:18,780
cuz it doesn't hold up to the times yeah

120
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,770
but at the time it scared people so bad

121
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,600
that they were running out of the

122
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:22,950
theaters vomiting they had priests in

123
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,970
the theaters because people were so

124
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:28,169
freaked imagine that happening today I

125
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:29,669
don't think that whatever happened no

126
00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:31,650
there's nothing like they kept on camera

127
00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:33,390
no the internet desensitized us to

128
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:34,650
everything okay I'm gonna get my list of

129
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:35,460
favorites no I don't want your feedback

130
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:38,729
okay

131
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:40,710
my top two are probably tied between

132
00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:41,669
hereditary and sinister and obviously

133
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:43,080
that are very different movies

134
00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:44,820
hereditary was one of the first movies

135
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,460
that I ever saw that actually left me

136
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:48,630
like frightened there was not a lot of

137
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,400
jump scares the movie but I actually

138
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:52,229
left the theater and went home was like

139
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,770
oh well I had a little bit spooked to go

140
00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:55,260
to sleep tonight

141
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:56,880
like left my stomach churning and that's

142
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,190
what it was it's disturbing it's a good

143
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,380
way to

144
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:01,180
that was a good movie I love love love

145
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,720
hurts Harry my next favorite as above so

146
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:06,220
below

147
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:08,260
great did you see scary stories to tell

148
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,980
in the dark but I heard that the FX was

149
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,570
really good

150
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:13,030
phenomenal there's one theme that

151
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:14,890
literally it was so uncomfortable to

152
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:16,510
watch that I like felt like I was gonna

153
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:18,880
throw up but also could not take my eyes

154
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:20,950
off the screen so I was so intrigued by

155
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,780
both the visuals and just the thought of

156
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:23,140
what went on to create what I was

157
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,760
watching

158
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:26,110
so one of the stories is like this boy

159
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,490
he lives on a farm then you have the

160
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:29,080
Scarecrow he always kicks it with this

161
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:30,940
friend and then one day the Scarecrow

162
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,410
comes to life and kills him and then

163
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:33,370
when he kills them with the boy turns

164
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:35,080
into a scarecrow

165
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:37,690
the Scarecrow stabs him starts coughing

166
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:39,400
and hay starts coming out of his mouth

167
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:40,630
he sees his arms and like hey stars are

168
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,990
coming out of his sleeves and like his

169
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:45,190
finger so he turns into the Scarecrow

170
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:46,750
bunny like it's literally like

171
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:49,180
suffocating out hey and there's like

172
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:50,170
vines and like oh my god literally just

173
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:53,890
thinking about it make me feel

174
00:06:50,170 --> 00:07:07,870
uncomfortable but they did it so it was

175
00:06:53,890 --> 00:07:09,610
insane to watch so now unless we were in

176
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:12,310
a powder oh thank you can I make a

177
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:14,650
confession I'm awful at scar wax we all

178
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:16,510
are it's just the nature of the beast

179
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:18,220
are you serious yeah it's very hard to

180
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:19,810
work with but impossible I literally

181
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:21,010
thought I was just like incompetent and

182
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:22,720
couldn't figure out the right math you

183
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:24,460
know it's hard to work with but for

184
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,290
something like what we're doing today if

185
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:28,780
we can get it to work it is our best

186
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:30,730
shot at it looking great it's a great

187
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:32,470
out of kit option guidance its

188
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:34,570
difficulties there's a couple tricks

189
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:36,580
that make it easier one of which is

190
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:37,390
putting prosy down first Oh hasn't it

191
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:40,660
has something to stick to

192
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:42,430
okay right now okay and the other thing

193
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:44,650
you can do to make it easier is you need

194
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:46,090
a Vaseline uh-huh so that it doesn't

195
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:47,710
stick to your hands

196
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,780
so you grease up your hands first and

197
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:50,730
then you

198
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:53,460
the nose and scar wax and then it's

199
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:55,020
easier to use oh my god Wow I'm changing

200
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:57,060
yeah that does actually feel like it

201
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:58,380
would be a major help every time that

202
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,730
I've ever had to use it just molds to my

203
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:01,050
fingers and you start sticking and then

204
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:03,090
you can't achieve anything

205
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:04,260
yes what is your favorite transformation

206
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:07,530

208
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:12,510

213
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:22,650
the Mona Lisa wasn't done in a day okay

214
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,760
my nose is like the one thing my face

215
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:28,050
that I used to be really really insecure

216
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:29,130
about but thank you hey hey did when I

217
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,330
first heard you make it because I could

218
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:31,860
not figure out how to contour it for the

219
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:33,750
life of me and I thought it was so ugly

220
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:35,580
plus you're young I mean honestly I feel

221
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:39,000
like people grow into their face and

222
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:40,560
their noses yeah there's probably melts

223
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:53,130
in there no it's just scar wax but it

224
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:56,240

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,490
makeup kind of period let alone

yeah Mikey what are your favorite ways

279
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:23,090
to stay inspired for actual Halloween

280
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:24,830
looks what I tend to do is I think of

281
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:27,530
something that I just really like like a

282
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:29,180
movie that I really like or show or a

283
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:30,650
character and then I try to think of

284
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:32,660
some kind of twist to put on it or

285
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:34,730
whether it's like a gender bender or

286
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:37,520
it's a glam thing and I put an FX twist

287
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:40,640
on it and like that or just if all else

288
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:42,279
fails pick a really common costumer

289
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,139
character and then some

290
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:46,999
this year for Halloween I was feeling a

291
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:49,759

okay

341
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:32,320
so I'm going to add some veins a little

342
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:34,600
bit of detailing and then I think it's

343
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,420

345
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:40,390
of things okay you just happened with

346
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:43,300
out with water and it just disappeared

347
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:45,070
that's kind of the secret to veins is if

348
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,690
you tap it out when it's water based or

349
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:48,430
alcohol based it looks like it's under

350
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:50,770
the skin a little bit more that's so

351
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:52,960
