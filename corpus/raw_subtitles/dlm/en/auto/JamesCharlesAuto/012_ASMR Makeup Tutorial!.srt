22
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,520

23
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:55,360
i didn't so now we're here in case you

24
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,239

autonomous sensory meridian response oh

26
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,480
look at me

27
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,399
a lot of different people love watching

28
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,159
asmr videos for different reasons

29
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,680
some people it helps them calm down and

30
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,080
help some people fall asleep

31
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,840
it reduces anxiety and a lot of times as

32
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,840
well there are certain

33
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,840
sounds

34
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,600
and there's certain sounds oh my god

35
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,200
there's certain sounds that give people

36
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,920
the tingles and can really help them out

37
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,759
which i think is

38
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,759
super cool i've watched a lot of asmr

39
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,280
videos i respect the art i respect the

40
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,119
youtubers for me personally

41
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,280
they don't give me those like tingly

42
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,119
sensations i wish that they did but who

43
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,560
knows i'm always open to trying things

44
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,320
and maybe in today's video i'll

45
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,640
experience it so if you want to

46
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:41,840

ahead and get started of course the

50
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,040
first step to my makeup routine is

51
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,560

55
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,560
relaxing

56
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:09,840

that's stupid

132
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,199
when i first started doing makeup i used

133
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,960
to use literally like an ounce concealer

134
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,199
every time doing the full-on like

135
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,199
stripes painting everywhere but now i've

136
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,759
really realized that less

137
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,560
is more dab dab dab dab dab it's not

138
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,720

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,919
it's okay the powder tastes good it

147
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,919
tastes like beaches

148
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,639
beautiful

149
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,639

to reinforce my contours and blushes and

152
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,840
highlights

153
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,840
quickly using a little bit of powder

154
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,249
[Music]

155
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,379
[Music]

156

158
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:27,840
i just need to drive my settings by

159
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:27,840
really quickly

i decided to do my other brow off camera

163
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,760
because honestly i was getting bored and

164
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,560
whispering is a lot more tiring than i

165
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,080
would have thought

166
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,760
i'm back and we're gonna finish up the

167
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,959

my eyelash curler from mac

169
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,279
cosmetics that's probably not very

170
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,640
satisfying

171
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,800
