00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:08,610
hi sisters James Charles here and

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:10,050
welcome back to my youtube channel so as

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,210
you can see today I am rocking this

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,580
super super simple but also get super

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:17,190
glam and effective black smoked out

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,390
winged liner I freaking love how this

7
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,430
look turned out and it is of course

8
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:21,930
inspired by the legendary Kim K herself

9
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,420
and this picture that Mario denna

10
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:26,580
banovic posted on his Instagram I know I

11
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,930
just did a k'kaw Beauty review and a

12
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,939
kendall Jenner inspired look a few weeks

13
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:31,650
ago but I cannot even begin to explain

14
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:33,960
when I saw this original picture of my

15
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,910
mouth dropped to the floor it was just

16
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,530
so beautiful and so stunning but also so

17
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,850
simple and effective at the same time I

18
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,920
just needed to recreate it and show you

19
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,879
guys how to do it before we actually get

20
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,170
into this look I have just a little

21
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:45,719
something for you guys and that is going

22
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,070
to be a giveaway so as you guys know and

23
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:48,870
if you saw my video from a few weeks ago

24
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,550
the Jacqueline Hill & morphe brushes

25
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,890
collab just launched and it's probably

26
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,030
one of the best palettes of all time

27
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,530
I do actually use this palette in the

28
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,989
video today but obviously I use like my

29
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,430
crusty dusty used version not the brand

30
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:00,870
new one when the original palette

31
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,670
launched it did end up selling out in

32
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,350
only 45 minutes and that left a ton of

33
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,430
you guys without in your hands so I

34
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:06,420
thought it would be a perfect giveaway

35
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,189
being that the palette does actually

36
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,049

the video if you want to see how I

61
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:50,070
created this smokey winged out Kim

62
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,360
Kardashian inspired makeup look make

63
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:53,040
sure you keep on watching

64
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,750
alright sir I already went ahead and

65
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,490
primed my face using my benefit total

66
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:59,640
moisture moisturizer and then my benefit

67
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:00,930
Porefessional primer as always I'm gonna

68
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,030
put on a headband here because my hair

69
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,890
is looking a real real wonky today and

70
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,420
it's not styling for the life of me so I

71
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:08,099
kind of just gave up I'm gonna throw in

72
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,000
a hat as soon as possible just bear with

73
00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:11,890
me while I do my base here and I

74
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,650
I will fix this situation in a few

75
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:15,819
minutes for my foundation today as

76
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:17,560
always I'm gonna be using my makeup

77
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:20,019
forever Ultra HD foundation stick in the

78
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,340
shade of y 335 and I'm just gonna put

79
00:02:20,019 --> 00:02:25,530
this all over my face but I'm actually

80
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:25,530
not going to use too much of it today

81
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:32,010
and then of course I'm just gonna take

82
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:32,010
my damp Beauty blender and blend this in

83
00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:37,959
for concealer today we're going to be

84
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:39,879
using of course Maya tart shaped tape

85
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:41,709
concealer of the Holy Grail and today

86
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:43,299
I'm using the shade light I have usually

87
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:45,580
been using the shade light medium honey

88
00:02:43,299 --> 00:02:47,560
recently but in the photo Kim definitely

89
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:49,269
has some very very very high contrast

90
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,010
between the rest of her face and her

91
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:52,599
like t-zone region being her under eyes

92
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,739
in the very center of her forehead so I

93
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:55,450
do want to recruit that as much as

94
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:58,690
possible and add that our Vic terno

95
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:59,829
2010 at Kim K SIA of glam I'm so

96
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:01,329
freaking excited to see the fact that

97
00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:03,280
she's definitely going back to her like

98
00:03:01,329 --> 00:03:03,819
roots with the full on full coverage

99
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,829
glam

100
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:07,780
I missed that Kim so much it was by far

101
00:03:05,829 --> 00:03:09,190
my favorite era of hers I do obviously

102
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,870
love the natural face she's in as well

103
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:13,000
as I've said a million times in the past

104
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:16,170
few videos but you always got to go back

105
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,170
to your roots at some point

106
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,270
all right so I just went ahead and

107
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,950
quickly set my face and locked it in

108
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:29,110
place using my Too Faced Born This Way

109
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:30,640
ethereal setting powder I have a very

110
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:32,380
very exciting and fun video coming out

111
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,790
in a few weeks from now about setting

112
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,230
powders and the battle between them and

113
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:37,150
flashback and everything and you can

114
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:39,160
possibly think of because lord knows I

115
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,690
am the queen of setting powders and

116
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,820
flashback photos so definitely stay

117
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:44,080
tuned for that coming soon so in the

118
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:46,240
photo that Mario posted Kim was

119
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,830
definitely super super bronzed and

120
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,610
contoured so of course I want to

121
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:50,920
recreate that as much as possible

122
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:52,390
because y'all know I love a good runs in

123
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,590
contoured look so of course I'm gonna

124
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:56,890
start off like I'm in my benefit hoola

125
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:58,690
bronzer and my morphe M 570 brush and

126
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:00,850
you can use code at James for 10% off

127
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:02,230
your purchase at morphe brushes com I'm

128
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:03,970
just gonna start chiseling out my

129
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:10,390
cheekbones and really warming up the

130
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:11,739
outside edges of my face I am definitely

131
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,720
rubbing a decent amount of this product

132
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:15,700
when I actually go and I am going pretty

133
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,959
light handed with this brush because I

134
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,459
do want a lot of product on there but I

135
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,200
want to build it up slowly over time

136
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:22,030
because if we put a lot on there at one

137
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,770
time is just gonna get super super muddy

138
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:25,720
and obviously we want it to be super

139
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:27,729
super blended out and nice and beautiful

140
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,800
and bronzy so I am just being a pretty

141
00:04:27,729 --> 00:04:31,600
careful to go nice and slow and just

142
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,840
disperse the color evenly all throughout

143
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:38,669
my face I'm also going to use this color

144
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,669
to bronze up my forehead as always

145
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:48,350
I'm also gonna grab my age 80 81 82 Luxy

146
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,700
180 perhaps oh my god and dip it into a

147
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:51,860
little bit more of hoola bronzer just to

148
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:54,080
lightly contour my nose I'm actually not

149
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,610
gonna do the very signature snatched

150
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,560
James Charles nose I just want to do a

151
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:59,300
light contour just a little something

152
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,320
but definitely not super super intense

153
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,240
because it's just gonna look very very

154
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,950
wonky with this look because we do want

155
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,950
to go for that natural more dewy skin

156
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,450
all right so you guys know I'm a very

157
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:13,100
very loyal more if you stand up but

158
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:14,540
there's one nod morphing brush that I

159
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,669
have been absolutely obsessive lately

160
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:19,130
and that is the makeup Shack t89 brush

161
00:05:16,669 --> 00:05:20,600
it's just this fluffy brush and I am

162
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:22,070
gonna grab this using my Kat Von D shade

163
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,230
and light palette and I'm gonna tip into

164
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:25,640
it the darkest shade of the contour

165
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:27,020
palette and I am going to definitely

166
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:29,660
dust off that brush because I don't want

167
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:31,700
too much but I've been loving this brush

168
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:33,320
for just going in the very very very

169
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,970
hollow of my cheek bone right in the

170
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,500
bottom of that contour I feel like it

171
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:38,150
really defines the contour so well it

172
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,350
also allows you to blend it out so you

173
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:41,390
don't get that like really really harsh

174
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:44,030
light but it definitely does look super

175
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:44,960
super cut and defined and natural and

176
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:47,840
then of course I'm just gonna go back

177
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,700
into my original M 574 morphe and just

178
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,930
blend that oh and like oh my god look at

179
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,600
how good that looks it looks like a

180
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:56,270
natural super super defined Angelina

181
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,040
Jolie cheekbone I freaking love these

182
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:59,030
two brushes together it's a match made

183
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,229
in heaven

184
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:01,550
I don't want to bake today just because

185
00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:03,650
I do want my skin to be really really

186
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:05,210
moist and hydrated but the one thing I

187
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:06,680
am gonna do is guy my Beauty Blender I

188
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:08,390
just admit to a tiny bit of that setting

189
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,280
powder and just lock in the sides of my

190
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:12,140
nose just to snatch that nose contour a

191
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,090
little bit and just to hold it in place

192
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,830
because it's already getting oily

193
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:17,060
because of these studio lights in front

194
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,680
of me and it is very very hot in

195
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:21,910
California today so I definitely don't

196
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,910
my nose to melt

197
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,819
okay finally I can take this stupid

198
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:31,449
headband off and replace it with my huh

199
00:06:27,819 --> 00:06:33,220
thank God alright so for blush today you

200
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:35,229
guys know that I usually use Mac peaches

201
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,520
this is my all-time favorite blush but

202
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:38,169
for today I'm actually gonna exchange

203
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,419
that and I'm going to be using the Mac

204
00:06:38,169 --> 00:06:42,160
blushes in the shade spring sheen

205
00:06:40,419 --> 00:06:43,660
instead this is actually a very very

206
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,550
similar color to peaches when you put

207
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:46,690
them next to each other but Spring Sheen

208
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:48,220
does have a little bit of shimmer to it

209
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:50,139
which is perfect because we definitely

210
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,550
want that radiant skin look and we are

211
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:53,470
gonna be using a lot of gold tone

212
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:54,639
highlighter as well so this will just do

213
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:59,199
a good job of mending everything

214
00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:00,460
together alright so I just went ahead

215
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,020
and quickly did my brows and my eye

216
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:03,639
primer off-camera and you guys have seen

217
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,349
me do a million times out there is no

218
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:06,699
point in including it let's go ahead and

219
00:07:05,349 --> 00:07:08,680
get started well we're all waiting for

220
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:09,729
and that is the eye shadow so for this I

221
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,710
said a look today I'm gonna use in the

222
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:13,090
morphe X chocolate Hill eyes shadow

223
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:14,560
palette now obviously this look is

224
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:16,780
mostly black land we're just a pinch of

225
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,490
brown and warm tone orange but this

226
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,810
palette is just so freakin bomb and so

227
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:21,099
pigmented as I'm sure you've heard it

228
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:23,289
literally everybody and their mothers

229
00:07:21,099 --> 00:07:24,819
say it but it is actually true so if

230
00:07:23,289 --> 00:07:26,319
you're watching this today on Monday the

231
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:28,120

launch it's sold out at only 45 minutes

236
00:07:34,449 --> 00:07:37,570
and I know not a lot of people were able

237
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,680
to get their hands on them which is why

238
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm doing the giveaway in the beginning

239
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,680

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,580
you can use code jinx for 10% off your

00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:53,199
purchase this palette is something you

247
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:55,960
need in your collection I am not kidding

248
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,370
when I say it is so beyond good before

249
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,750
we get into the actual liner I do just

250
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:00,130
want her to find my crease a little bit

251
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,930
and for this I'm gonna grab my morphe

252
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:03,669
m43 3 brush and dip into the shade

253
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:06,009
butter and just put this right into the

254
00:08:03,669 --> 00:08:07,479
crease this step is definitely not vital

255
00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:09,430
you can totally skip out and go right to

256
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:11,289
the liner portion but since I did it

257
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:13,090
prime my eyelids with some concealer and

258
00:08:11,289 --> 00:08:14,440
not like a transparent primer I do just

259
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:16,150
want to add a little bit of dimension

260
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:18,039
back into my eyelid but that's just

261
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:19,000
personal preference I'm going to take a

262
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,590
quick break from the palette for a

263
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,630
second and I'm gonna grab my Inglot gel

264
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:24,280
liner in the shade block obviously to

265
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:26,380
start off this wing and just catch this

266
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:28,949
out I'm gonna use my sigma e06 winged

267
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,949
liner brush

268
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:34,360
it has been so long stuck on a winged

269
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:36,099
liner using a gel liner my hands are

270
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,570
shaking so hardcore / some reason I

271
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:44,380
don't know why I'm like still nervous to

272
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:46,180
do this oh my god with this liner I'm

273
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:47,800
also going to make sure to tight line up

274
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:49,660
my waterline as well because there's

275
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:53,589
definitely a very very smoky look going

276
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:55,060
on alright so I just went ahead and I

277
00:08:53,589 --> 00:08:56,950
tight line off-camera using my edge away

278
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:58,330
a black pencil clearly that's the

279
00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:00,520
tration was not working out too well and

280
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:01,630
I do not want to risk anything again and

281
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,550
of course I still managed to somehow

282
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:04,450
smudge black liner onto my lid but you

283
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:06,070
know what we're just gonna do with it

284
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:07,420
we're gonna move on alright so going

285
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:08,830
back to my tiny little liner brush I'm

286
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:10,210
gonna dip into the English eyeliner one

287
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:11,890
last time I'm gonna draw this little

288
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:13,839
wing in the center corner of the eye

289
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:15,040
look this is obviously featured in Kim's

290
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,570
look and this is a very very popular

291
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,970
technique in Arabic makeup that just is

292
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:20,020
so so freakin beautiful I personally

293
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:21,279
have a very very hard time doing this

294
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:23,230
because I do have a little bit of skin

295
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,310
that actually covers my inner corner but

296
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:27,040
I'm just gonna draw over it and hope

297
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:28,570
that it it works kind of now going back

298
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,800
into Thor female I'm gonna grab my two

299
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:31,660
one two brush and I'm just gonna dip

300
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,730
into the shade abyss which is just this

301
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,959
black in the bottom corner it is so

302
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:36,370
freaking pigmented and we were going to

303
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,730
use that shade to smoke out our liner

304
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:38,730
today

305
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:48,179
this looks awful okay this literally

306
00:09:45,389 --> 00:09:57,540
looks awful so I'm going to try to take

307
00:09:48,179 --> 00:09:59,399
off the outer wing portion how you asked

308
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,959
I have no idea all right now that the

309
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:02,759
wing isn't taking up our entire eyelid

310
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,769
let's go ahead and try this again my two

311
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:06,269
one two once again at dipping into abyss

312
00:10:04,769 --> 00:10:12,360
let's go ahead and smoke out this liner

313
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:13,829
very very carefully the nerves degree of

314
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,209
my makeup Shakti to brush and I'm just

315
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:28,699
going to smoke out the edges at once

316
00:10:15,209 --> 00:10:28,699
again and then finally my morphe m56 one

317
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,010
okay honestly for an I we had a

318
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,470
completely performing surgery on and

319
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:40,090
this really did not turn out that bad

320
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:42,130
thank God I'm not going to go mighty to

321
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:43,300
brush and dab back into a best and I'm

322
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:49,060
going to smoke out the lower lash line

323
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:50,770
as well I'm just keeping this color

324
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:52,900
super super close to the lash line

325
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:54,670
because we do want that smoky effect but

326
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,540
not bringing it down too low because we

327
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:57,070
don't want to be really really

328
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:58,780
overpowering and we're essentially

329
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:00,580
making sure to really concert that color

330
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:03,670
on at the outer corner and connecting up

331
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:05,410
to the way to really like circulate and

332
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:07,180
complete the eye I'm gonna go to the my

333
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:11,100
m56 one brush and just buff over the

334
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:11,100
edge to make sure it's not going too low

335
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:15,280
as you can see this look is actually

336
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:16,630
super super simple to achieve it just

337
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,950
looks complicated and you definitely to

338
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:19,300
be careful because the black

339
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:21,010
I can definitely end up everywhere as

340
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:22,630
you just saw so just be careful when

341
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:24,520
you're blending but let's go ahead and

342
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:25,810
move on to it the lashes so for the

343
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,850
lashes today I definitely do something

344
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:29,440
very natural in the picture of Kim who's

345
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:32,950
actually only wearing mascara which

346
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,060
makes me so freakin angry like oh the

347
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:35,890
fact that anybody can have natural

348
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:38,320
lashes that good is so beyond me because

349
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:39,460
unfortunately I cannot relate so for the

350
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,710
lashes today I just want to use the

351
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:43,180
ardell demi whispies these are a very

352
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:44,620
brave natural pair I used to use these

353
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:46,270
on all the girls in my local hometown

354
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,560
when I did their prom makeup they're

355
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,430
just very very beautiful but definitely

356
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,420
are just a little bit of

357
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:53,070
something-something so I'm just gonna

358
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:53,070
glue them on of course as always

359
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:04,460
and then just to blend my regular lashes

360
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:06,080
with my fake ones together I'm gonna

361
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:09,610
grab my benefit roller lash mascara and

362
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,610
just play a very very light coat

363
00:12:10,339 --> 00:12:13,800
so both eyes are now complete and of

364
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:15,869
course the next type is going to be the

365
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,879
glow I know I use this one all the time

366
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:19,649
but for today I'm using my Anasazi so

367
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:20,879
Hollywood illuminator this is one of my

368
00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:22,199
all-time faves and for this look we

369
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:23,699
definitely do want to be super super

370
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:26,129
gold then I cannot think of a better

371
00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:28,379
gold highlighter than this one and to

372
00:12:26,129 --> 00:12:33,329
play uncle using my morphe EMB 23 brush

373
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:35,399
oh wow yeah and you guys know normally I

374
00:12:33,329 --> 00:12:37,199
would use my morphe M 501 brush this is

375
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:38,399
like my go-to highlighter but recently

376
00:12:37,199 --> 00:12:39,929
I've been actually loving using a

377
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,569
smaller brushes of four highlighters to

378
00:12:39,929 --> 00:12:44,040
get like a more precise and confined

379
00:12:42,569 --> 00:12:45,300
highlighter I don't know if you think

380
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,160
I'm getting a board of like the look of

381
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,660
highlighter like everywhere all over the

382
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:51,230
face i doesn't really love you to look

383
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:53,309
like a natural natural tiny to find

384
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:54,660
highlighter moment I don't know personal

385
00:12:53,309 --> 00:12:57,059
preference do whatever you want

386
00:12:54,660 --> 00:13:00,839
oh my god yes this literally looks so

387
00:12:57,059 --> 00:13:02,100
frickin pretty Wow okay this area of my

388
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:03,660
forehead is actually still my favorite

389
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,649
places the highly on my entire face and

390
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,240
I've been getting a lot of questions

391
00:13:04,649 --> 00:13:07,019
about it lately - everyone's like why

392
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,009
the hell are you highlighting your

393
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:09,869
forehead I thought you wanted to make it

394
00:13:08,009 --> 00:13:13,199
look smaller and well yes I definitely

395
00:13:09,869 --> 00:13:14,879
do that is for sure when you sweat

396
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:16,559
obviously this way is going to hit the

397
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,540
light and it's gonna reflect naturally

398
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:20,189
where the light or where the liquid is

399
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,449
on your face that's just how science

400
00:13:20,189 --> 00:13:23,220
works Wow

401
00:13:21,449 --> 00:13:25,259
so by adding highlighter here and making

402
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:26,699
that light hit it and catch it it just

403
00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:28,199
helps to kind of further along the look

404
00:13:26,699 --> 00:13:29,939
of that dewy and not your foundation

405
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:31,199
because not all of us unfortunately can

406
00:13:29,939 --> 00:13:34,470
be blessed with that beautiful glowing

407
00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:36,480
skin but we got to fake it till we make

408
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:38,399

409
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,670
into the dose of colors new lipstick in

410
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,670

411
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:48,540
