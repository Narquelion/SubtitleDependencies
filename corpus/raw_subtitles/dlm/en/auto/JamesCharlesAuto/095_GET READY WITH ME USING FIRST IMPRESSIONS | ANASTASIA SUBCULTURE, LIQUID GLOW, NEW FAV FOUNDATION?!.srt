00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,779
they couldn't have came two days earlier

00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,460

17
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:33,989
I would regarding to what we've got for

18
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,640

19
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:37,469

foundation a new highlighter and a new

22
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,870
eyeshadow palette so a ton of great new

23
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,129
products that I am so excited to try and

24
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:47,219
honestly all turned out really really

25
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:49,260
good spoiler alert so I did this warm

26
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:50,460
tone a pop of color crease that you guys

27
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,230
have all been asking me to film a

28
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,820
tutorial on I posted a pic on my answer

29
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,680
a few days ago and y'all went crazy and

30
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,969
I did do this look using the new Anasazi

31
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,320
a subculture eye palette and it turned

32
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:00,239
out so freakin good

33
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,829
so if you want to see how I created this

34
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,300
makeup look right here using all new

35
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:05,519
products and first impressions make sure

36
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,869
you keep on watching alright so before I

37
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,220
go into the actual foundation I'm gonna

38
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:11,159
first go into my benefit Porefessional

39
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,540
new pore minimizing makeup now in the

40
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,310
last video if you guys have not checked

41
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,710
it out yet definitely go watch it it is

42
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,000
a PR unboxing video but I got three of

43
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,920
these and I thought that this was like a

44
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,030
three-step process but my dumbass failed

45
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,530
to realize that there's actually three

46
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:25,950
different shades not three different

47
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,659
steps so I grabbed shade number two and

48
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,850
I'm going to put this on and see how it

49
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:31,890
works hopefully we'll be minimizing my

50
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,000
pores because I could use it alright so

51
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,530
I guess this product is not technically

52
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,390
a foundation it just as its pore

53
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:38,970
minimizing makeup I'm not really sure

54
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,710
what that technically makes it as but if

55
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:43,200
I look close up in the mirror my pores

56
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:44,310
honestly do look really really good they

57
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,570
don't look like completely cover

58
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,530
obviously there's gonna be nothing that

59
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,820
I can put on my face that's kind of

60
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:49,409
completely go into my pores

61
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,630
unfortunately for me and for everybody

62
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:53,970
else out there but definitely they do

63
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,350
look pretty pretty balm and looking at

64
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:57,090
the monitor as well my skin definitely

65
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:58,530
has like a blurred effect so I think I

66
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:00,210
actually really really like this product

67
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,310
but let's see how actually layer

68
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:03,960
underneath foundation okay so Furcal and

69
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,549
ations they were actually using a brand

70
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,590
new at first impressions product and

71
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:09,929
that is the Smashbox to do skin is

72
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,250
shaping foundation it is a dual ended

73
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:12,840
foundation stick with one end being

74
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,650
Foundation's and wanted being a contour

75
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,269
stick so

76
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,530
I am super super excited to try these

77
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:18,150
out I've heard really really good things

78
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:20,069
about them and I did actually get to

79
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:22,470
test use this a very very very long time

80
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:24,030
ago with matchbox and I was in love with

81
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:25,349
it then so this is not really a first

82
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:27,510
impressions for like a second

83
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:29,940
impressions but I think it'll be good

84
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:31,470
hopefully I grab the shade of 1.2 which

85
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,720
looking at it on my face is definitely a

86
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:35,400
little bit too yellow and I know people

87
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,959
love to comments like my foundation it

88
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,519
doesn't match my neck thank you I am

89
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,560
well aware of the fact that I like to

90
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:42,420
use a more tan foundation than my

91
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,620
skintone I think I get so many comments

92
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,599
about it and it is definitely something

93
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,640
that I am aware of and do on purpose so

94
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,410
thank you so much for your concern but

95
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,459
I'm gonna be using this shade today and

96
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,420
it is definitely yellow and I'm

97
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:52,980
recognizing that right now so please

98
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,090
don't comment about it aside for the

99
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,769
fact that this foundation stick is

100
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,120
nowhere near the right color for me I

101
00:02:55,769 --> 00:02:58,680
actually really really like how it looks

102
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,000
on my face it is definitely way too

103
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,010
yellow but I'm gonna even it out with

104
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,629
some concealer so far so good

105
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:05,280
before I go into any concealer I'm gonna

106
00:03:03,629 --> 00:03:07,079
quickly cream contour my face using the

107
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,340
other end of the foundation stick this

108
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:09,510
is saying that I definitely don't like

109
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,730
doing very often I definitely before

110
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:13,319
contouring with powders however for the

111
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:15,180
sake of this video obviously I want to

112
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:17,459
give the product a fair shot and a full

113
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,169
on review so I'm going to cream contour

114
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:20,430
just the slightest bit alright so this

115
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:22,109
is definitely blending out really really

116
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,700
well as you can see it does not take a

117
00:03:22,109 --> 00:03:24,720
lot of effort at all and it runs really

118
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,310
really nice the end of the skin

119
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,690
obviously no one wants to sit there

120
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,639
pouncing a Beauty Blender into their

121
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:30,930
freaking cheek for 30 minutes trying to

122
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:33,090
blend out a cream product so it looks

123
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:35,280
good and this is definitely going out in

124
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,900
a pretty little effort which is awesome

125
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,760
and I do like the color of this as well

126
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,530
it's definitely like a contour and

127
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,970
bronzing at the same time which is a

128
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:43,260
great and definitely a time saver as

129
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:45,239
well that's kind of how I like to do my

130
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,650
contour slash bronzer in the first place

131
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:48,090
I really don't do them separately

132
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,799
they're kind of like one baking process

133
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:51,690
free and that's how I really do like it

134
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:53,639
so I definitely I'm liking this

135
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:55,019
foundation stick a lot I'm gonna try to

136
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:57,150
fix up my skin tone a little bit using

137
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:59,160
the Tarte shape tape and light I do not

138
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:00,660
get any new concealers in my PR packages

139
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,730
although color pop I know just came out

140
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,930
with new concealers and I'm dying to try

141
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:05,190
those so definitely let me know if you

142
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:07,560
guys nothing to do a video review on

143
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:09,030
those once I get them in the mail with

144
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,359
my luck they'll probably come in like 20

145
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,379
minutes

146
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:11,639
as I'm felling this video after I

147
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:13,290
already had my shape tape on but

148
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:15,239
whatever it will make it work another

149
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:16,650
time the actual color of the foundation

150
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:18,060
definitely looks a lot better now that

151
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:19,380
I've lined it up my concealer and I'm of

152
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,060
course it's gonna set it really lightly

153
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:23,039
in place using my Laura Mercier

154
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,969
translucent setting powder all right so

155
00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:25,380
it's called my face today I'm gonna

156
00:04:23,969 --> 00:04:27,110
using the brand new makeup forever

157
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:29,659
artist face color

158
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:31,759
single little thing and this is in the

159
00:04:29,659 --> 00:04:32,810
shade asked one one two and as I talked

160
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,129
about in last week's video this has a

161
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:36,469
very very special place in my heart

162
00:04:34,129 --> 00:04:37,430
because sister caste want my best

163
00:04:36,469 --> 00:04:39,110
friends in the entire world

164
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:41,360
did actually work with makeup forever on

165
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:42,919
creating these shadows and bringing them

166
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,750
all together to create a little bit of a

167
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:47,240
trio so I'm gonna be using her three

168
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:49,729
shades today to sculpt and make my face

169
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,110
look beautiful this contour sheet is

170
00:04:49,729 --> 00:04:53,360
definitely very very cool tool because

171
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:55,129
sister Cassie is more on the pale side

172
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,719
and she has a more like pink undertone

173
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:58,310
but this honestly looks really really

174
00:04:56,719 --> 00:05:00,169
good on my skin it doesn't look grey or

175
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:01,460
like Ashley in any way shape or form it

176
00:05:00,169 --> 00:05:04,400
got fleas like a very very good like

177
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:05,779
cheek bone or like bone shadow type of

178
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,300
color it looks like very very natural

179
00:05:05,779 --> 00:05:09,349
and chiseled out I really like this for

180
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:11,150
blush today I'm gonna grab the maker

181
00:05:09,349 --> 00:05:13,490
Forever artists face color blush in the

182
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:16,039
shade of B 402 now as you can see this

183
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:17,870
is bright ass orange so I'm only gonna

184
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:19,819
use a very very little bit of this but

185
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:22,759
you guys do know that I love orange

186
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:24,289
blush a lot and oh my god this is very

187
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:28,330
very very pigmented which is a good

188
00:05:24,289 --> 00:05:28,330
thing but also a scary thing oh my god

189
00:05:28,419 --> 00:05:32,680
I'm just gonna really really lightly

190
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:36,919
table something that's a lot of blush

191
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:41,589
this is not what I want this is not what

192
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:47,330
I planned and I just gotta say I do not

193
00:05:41,589 --> 00:05:52,029
understand something is really something

194
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:54,169
is orange something is really wrong

195
00:05:52,029 --> 00:05:56,479
someone is literally playing music

196
00:05:54,169 --> 00:05:58,339
outside my window so loud right now for

197
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:02,509
no reason at all I'm getting so annoyed

198
00:05:58,339 --> 00:06:04,250
and now their sirens of course what else

199
00:06:02,509 --> 00:06:05,960
could go wrong I just did my brows

200
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,460
off-camera you guys to see me do it so

201
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,289
many times now no point in trying the

202
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:11,240
same exact process and now for the eye

203
00:06:09,289 --> 00:06:13,520
shadow we have the star of the show

204
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:16,039
don't do the on assad's you get

205
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,779
subculture eyeshadow palette I am so

206
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:19,460
excited for this this is actually not

207
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:20,990
featured in my last video and I did

208
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,279
feature the anasazi liquid glow

209
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:23,900
highlighters which we will be using in a

210
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:24,919
little while as well I just got this in

211
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,389
the mail a few minutes ago before I

212
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:28,219
started filming and I tweeted and so

213
00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:30,620
many of you guys wanted to see this now

214
00:06:28,219 --> 00:06:32,180
for the actual I look I was planning on

215
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:34,039
doing this cut crease the pop of color

216
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:35,750
left a few days ago on my Instagram

217
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:36,919
everybody was freaking out they loved it

218
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,430
everybody asked for a tutorial so I was

219
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:39,720
gonna film not to me but this

220
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:41,190
like I said just got here a few minutes

221
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,230
ago everyone's like oh my god you have

222
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:45,360
to use subculture so I am warning you

223
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:47,220
now I'm gonna be using the more classic

224
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,480
colors from this palette not the boring

225
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,830
ones at all because I feel like this is

226
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:52,110
gonna be so beautiful but there's

227
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:54,180
obviously like this teal tone the green

228
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:55,830
at the bronze II shade and the electric

229
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,570
chartreuse as well so I will not be

230
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:58,950
using those shades so please let me know

231
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:01,080
if you want to actually see a more

232
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:02,730
in-depth advanced tutorial using this

233
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,340
palette but for today's that I'm going

234
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:07,560
to use any more classic warm tone shades

235
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:09,960
I apologize for that but you guys asked

236
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,700
for this I first gotta grab my Anasazi

237
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,170
angled brush number seven and dip into

238
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,370
the shade of fudge and start sketching

239
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:19,170
out my crease

240
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:21,540
oh wow that is what we like to call it

241
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:22,680
ladies and gentlemen pigmented so cut

242
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:24,090
crease is releasing that I've done a lot

243
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,130
on my channel and they are by far my

244
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:29,340
favorite makeup look to do I just love

245
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:30,930
the look of a good cut snatched crease

246
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,340
and this is the technique that I used to

247
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:34,470
do them I always get questions about it

248
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:36,240
because it is only a unique technique

249
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:37,890
but I always start off by drawing at the

250
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,720
bottom of the crease line with an angle

251
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:42,030
brush just to define it in and then

252
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,800
blend upwards afterwards I'm gonna

253
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:45,120
centigram eye makeup Shakti 63 brush and

254
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,410
dipped into a little bit more fudge and

255
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,970
I'm just gonna buff out that line a

256
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:49,140
little bit now normally when it comes to

257
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,580
these eye looks beauty guru is never

258
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:52,020
even touch the brushes that actually

259
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,520
come in the palette but I am gonna grab

260
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:55,470
this one today on the fluffier and and

261
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,560
different edition new wave which is this

262
00:07:55,470 --> 00:08:00,300
like very mac and cheese orange e yellow

263
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:05,520
shade it's so beautiful and I'm just

264
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:06,960
gonna use this to blend that out oh my

265
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,440
god these shadows are so beyond

266
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,440
pigmented

267
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:14,840
oh my god it is no secret to anybody

268
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:16,520
that Anasazi always kills it with the

269
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:19,370
pigmentation in their shadows but oh my

270
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:21,230
god these are real good nice carving my

271
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:23,210
morphe r43 brush i'm gonna dip into the

272
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:27,950
shade all-star and I'm gonna use that to

273
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:29,600
to find out that crease again I'm gonna

274
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:31,580
grab my makeup Shakti 63 brush once

275
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,200
again and dip into the shade of Roxy and

276
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:35,539
I'm gonna use that to blend together the

277
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:39,159
fudge transition shade and the all-star

278
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:39,159
pinky shade if that makes sense

279
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:51,620
this is looking so messy for some reason

280
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,880
there's definite looking a little bit

281
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:10,149
more wonky than my normal crease and I

282
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,709
really don't know why exactly but you

283
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:12,940
know what we're just gonna keep going

284
00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:14,980
and hope that it looks good by the end

285
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:15,850
of this to finish off the shadow portion

286
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,770
of this crease I'm going to grab my

287
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:18,880
angled brush once again and dip it to

288
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:20,560
the tiniest little bit of the shade

289
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,190
rowdy and they're just going to carve it

290
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,190
out one last time

291
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,310
for some reason that was one of the

292
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:37,620
hardest cut creases I've ever had to do

293
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:38,910
I don't know why normally I can fly

294
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,830
through them so easily but today I'm

295
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:42,360
having an off day I guess whatever it

296
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,590
looks pretty decent now so I guess

297
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,180
they're gonna go ahead and move on and

298
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:46,710
for the pop of color liner today I'm

299
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:56,340
gonna be using the lime cryin liquid

300
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:57,540
liner in the shade sit truth you

301
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,860
definitely ought to be super super

302
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,940
careful at this step as well because

303
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,890
especially when it comes to colored

304
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:03,750
liner they're usually very very drying

305
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:06,390
so if you do mess up its gonna be a very

306
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:08,160
very very hard to fix your mistakes like

307
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:10,260
I have made several times throughout

308
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,390
doing this type of look so just be

309
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:13,710
careful please to do my Wayne Leonard

310
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:15,240
today I'm gonna use my tried-and-true

311
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:18,290
and that is the Kat Von D tattoo liner

312
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,290
in the shade it trooper

313
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:27,110
this is definitely a much bigger waiting

314
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:34,250
that I wanted to go forward today but I

315
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:35,420
guess it's just one of those days oh my

316
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:42,230
god I forgot to blend out their cream

317
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:43,880
contour underneath my lab for my lower

318
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:45,500
lash and I first gonna grab my fudge on

319
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,420
my morphe r43 brush and just buff that

320
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,890
into the lower lash line then I'm gonna

321
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,030
grab the other end of the Anasazi brush

322
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:51,890
that comes in the palette and I'm gonna

323
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:59,000
grab the show you a new wave and just

324
00:10:51,890 --> 00:11:00,470
buff out that color to line my water

325
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,170
then I'm gonna use the NYX wonder pencil

326
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:04,190
in the shade light actually helps to

327
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:05,840
open your eyes up and make your eyes

328
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:07,250
look huge in fact almost every single

329
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,590
time I wear a cut crease with a white

330
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:11,360
liner in my waterline I always get so

331
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:12,710
many comments feeling wide you facing

332
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,990
your eyes to be bigger and I'm like girl

333
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:17,570
about everything else on my entire face

334
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:20,630
is too soon except my eye shape why is

335
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:21,710
that even a concern so wonky and for the

336
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:24,110
last day I'm gonna pop on the house

337
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:25,940
luscious iconic lashes I know that in my

338
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:27,680
last video I did get a package from Lily

339
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:29,450
lashes and I use the miami's but I feel

340
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,190
like iconic lashes like the absolute

341
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:33,170
necessity last when it comes to a cut

342
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:35,600
crease they just look so beautiful and

343
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:37,070
so stunning and I did just get a new

344
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,170
package of these like 20 minutes ago

345
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:40,640
once again I was totally so annoyed for

346
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:42,020
some reason of course every single PR

347
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,970
package in the world decides to come

348
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:47,030
like three days after I film an unboxing

349
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:48,380
free PR video huh that's just my luck

350
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:49,400
while I'm gluing this lost I do want to

351
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,040
talk about something that I addressed in

352
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:53,360
the last video as well and that is the

353
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,220
illegal drugs that I received in my pure

354
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,440
package and I do want to give a major

355
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:59,360
major apology to a cloud9 syrup the

356
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,160
brand that did send me those products

357
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,290
they are not illegal and they are not

358
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:05,000
drugs either and I felt so bad because

359
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:06,560
like after reading your guys's comments

360
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,020
and doing some more research I was like

361
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,150
so shocked and I felt so ignorant dumb

362
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:13,070
so CBD and hemp oil are not illegal

363
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:15,380
contrary to what I thought in the video

364
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:16,940
and they're also in marijuana like I did

365
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:18,710
think they're actually unlike the

366
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:20,270
medical side of marijuana the part of it

367
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:21,110
that like actually helps you and doesn't

368
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:22,820
get you high

369
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:24,560
not gonna lie as soon as I recognize the

370
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:26,000
word hemp which I knew was in weed I was

371
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,920
so turned off because you guys know that

372
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,150
I'm very very anti drug and I am very

373
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,230
very ignorant to the topic it's

374
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,460
definitely not something that I've ever

375
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:33,230
wanted to learn about or wanted to

376
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,310
educate myself about just because I do

377
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:35,480
know that a lot of people in the social

378
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:37,910
media world and in the entertainment

379
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,200
industry do go into very very bad path

380
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:40,460
a lot of like drugs and addiction and

381
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,750
stuff so that's just saying that I've

382
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,700
tried it very very hard to stay away

383
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:45,110
from and I do pride myself in you can do

384
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,490
whatever you want but like I said I'm

385
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:48,050
very very ignorant to it so as soon as I

386
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:50,420
saw that I was like oh nope nope nope

387
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:51,890
nope not happening but after learning

388
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:53,570
about it more I did realize that it was

389
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:54,680
part of the medical side and I saw so

390
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:56,360
many comments from you guys being like

391
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,430
oh my god this is so disrespectful like

392
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,270
I used hemp oil and CBD every single

393
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:02,210
night because I have really bad anxiety

394
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:03,920
and I was like oh my god

395
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:05,060
obviously mental health is so important

396
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,950
that I would never want to purposely

397
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:09,110
degrade anxieties or mental health

398
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:11,030
issues at all and I really do sincerely

399
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:12,350
apologize if my comments in the last

400
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:14,150
video I offended you in any way shape or

401
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:15,890
form like I said I was ignorant to the

402
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:17,420
topic but now I've educated myself on it

403
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:19,220
and it's so amazing that products like

404
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:20,600
this do exist on the market to help

405
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,800
people out with those type of issues

406
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,660
because I know they are very very

407
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,550
serious thing like I said that is very

408
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:27,230
very much not my world and instead of

409
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:28,700
educating myself I just made a very very

410
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:30,350
ignorant comment for a clickbait title

411
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,450
which was definitely wrong so I do

412
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:33,410
apologize and it is still not for me but

413
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:35,810
if you guys want to check out their

414
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:37,280
products please do check them out they

415
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:38,600
are an awesome brand and the brand has

416
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,370
reached out to me cents and like gave me

417
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,690
a ton of information so yes

418
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:42,890
sorry to cloud9 syrup and if you guys

419
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:44,330
want to check it out I will link this up

420
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:46,340
down below alright and they're both

421
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:47,270
creases all cut and ready to go and now

422
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:49,580
it's time for what we've all been

423
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:51,620
waiting for the glow for my highlighter

424
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:53,420
today I'm using the brand new Anasazi

425
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:55,820
liquid glow and I'm gonna be using the

426
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:57,500
shade Perla today so in the last video I

427
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:58,940
swatch for you guys to shade peach phase

428
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,250
which if you actually look at the two

429
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:04,040
labels on the boxes the colors if it'll

430
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:05,810
focus look pretty relatively similar and

431
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,820
I did use peach phase but apparently

432
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:09,410
that is actually a darker shade than

433
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,970
Perla which is why I was giving that

434
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:12,650
dark reflect which I was worried about

435
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:13,850
so for today we're growing the shade

436
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:15,680
pearl and hopefully that'll be light

437
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:17,990
enough for my skin tone oh my god you're

438
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,380
kidding this is gonna be so good I can

439
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,380
already tell

440
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:26,460
so you can definitely apply a lot of it

441
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:28,020
in one area if you want to super

442
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:29,610
pigmented highlight and you also see

443
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:31,020
that you can apply a little bit of it

444
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:33,120
and really blend it out to get a more

445
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:35,400
subtle glow and it definitely like looks

446
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,930
beautiful either way guys sister

447
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,220

bit of this to highlight my nose oh my

453
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,970
god

454
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,830
literary satellites from space are

455
00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:02,990
crashing as we speak this note are you

456
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:02,990
kidding me this is so beautiful

457
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:08,790
and I'm also gonna play a little bit

458
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:10,260
this on my brow bone as always I've been

459
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:13,380
loving highlighting up here recently for

460
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:16,170
that summer natural dewy glow and oh my

461
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:19,650
god this highlighter is literally GG

462
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:21,450
gorged it is everything so the anasazi

463
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:22,680
liquid highlighters are definitely a win

464
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:25,320
from me as you can see on my face right

465
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,490
now they look so beyond sunny I am so

466
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,860
shocked and these are definitely a new

467
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:31,020
step to my regular makeup routine so

468
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:32,130
Hollywood can move over I mean this

469
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,780
sister would definitely still be here

470
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:35,340
but this is definitely a new contender

471
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:36,810
for sure and I definitely try these out

472
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:39,330
in my everyday makeup routine as well

473
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:40,380
but when I do like a more dewy no powder

474
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:42,330
looks I will definitely let you guys

475
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:43,650
know how it works on there - especially

476
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:45,240
unlike the body and the collarbones oh

477
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:47,310
my god I'm just picturing how frickin

478
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,720
stunning that would look alright so now

479
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:50,100
that this look is all complete the last

480
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,780
step is going to be the lips of course

481
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,730
and for today I'm using the ofra liquid

482
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:55,170
lipstick in the shade so Paulo this is

483
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:56,850

coach azar 30% off all oprah products

receive any new lip products in any PR

488
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:06,510
packages recently so yeah and then of

489
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:07,620
course to finish off this look we're

490
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:09,720
going to use our Urban Decay all nighter

491
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:12,830
