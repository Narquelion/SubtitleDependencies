quickly and document this just in case

7
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,440
this video does become

8
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,639
a reality if this video is being

9
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,000

for

13
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:24,410
finnegan

[Music]

15
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,439
okay you guys so we are currently in the

16
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,800
car on the way to go meet the puppy we

17
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,400
have obviously lewis in the back we have

18
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,679
eldon driving the vehicle

19
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,200
thank god we've already been in the car

20
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,160
for about 30 minutes we have another

21
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,079
basically hour

22
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,000
to go because of la traffic it's also

23
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,360
kind of far away but we are literally so

24
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,800
beyond excited louis and i have been

25
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,320
talking about wanting to get another dog

26
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,160
for quite a long time now

27
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,680
luis was the one who really brought up

28
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,480
the idea several months ago

29
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,760
and i was into the idea but i kept

30
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,039
putting it off because

31
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,160
we were obviously renovating the new

32
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,879
house and the last thing that i wanted

33
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,960
to do

34
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,079
was adopt a new puppy in a construction

35
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,879
zone because that would be a disaster

36
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,399
and very

37
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,680
unsafe period but we are officially in

38
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,039
the new house we've gotten settled we

39
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,520
filmed the house for a video so i feel

40
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,479
like it's

41
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,680
honestly a good time to bring another

42
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,760
dogger to the family yeah

43
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,760
finn's also been what's the word uh

44
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,080
clinging oh my god so i

45
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,040
think it'd be really good um no we love

46
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,720
it and he'll also

47
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,240
feel really excited being able to play

48
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,320
with someone and keep up that energy

49
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,000
that he has we also researched the dogs

50
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,479
that would the breeds that would work

51
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,920
best

52
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,280
yeah okay let's talk about that okay so

53
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,040
a lot of people in our lives have french

54
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,680
ball dogs including alvin and cassie

55
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,600
two two of them and kawa and we love

56
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,720
love love them so much and we actually

57
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,600
were really interested in getting a

58
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,520
frenchie as well

59
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,880
but alvin was actually telling us about

60
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,640
their legs and their

61
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,400
like spine because going up and down

62
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,079
stairs a lot is not good for them since

63
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,200
their bodies are so short yeah

64
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,640
and obviously we've already done three

65
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,640
years in the house three levels do we

66
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,240
actually yeah 41 why did you count that

67
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,000
because it's a lot of stairs that's

68
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,280
obviously our main priorities that

69
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,159
obviously the dog has to

70
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,520
you know fit in with finn to be real i'm

71
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,399
not really concerned with it honestly

72
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,840
finn

73
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,759
has literally gotten along with every

74
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,280
dog he's ever come in contact with

75
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,880
he's the sweetest but ultimately we

76
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,799
decided that the breed we really wanted

77
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,320
to bring into the family was a lab labs

78
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,079
are super easy to train they're very

79
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,600
friendly family dogs which is

80
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,119
very important for us just like with

81
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,599
finn we still have people over all the

82
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,440
time

83
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:12,879
anyway we have about a 45 minute drive

84
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,640
still to go so

85
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,680

[Music]

159
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,400
me oh sure finn how do you feel about

160
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,800
this so far he is so cute

161
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,000
oh my god finn just really really wants

162
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,880
to play what the problem is he doesn't

163
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,240
know how big he is

164
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,520
it's crazy because alvin's two french

165
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,560
bulldogs are the ones that usually are

166
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,400
playing with finn but they are like

167
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,840
literal tasmanian devils just like

168
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,600
zooming everywhere bumping into each

169
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,600
other like head first like crazy

170
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,759
so finn's not used to like playing

171
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,440
gently oh he's really climbing those

172
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,639
stairs

173
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:16,000
very athletic oh

174
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,759

190
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,560
that doesn't mess up his sleeping

191
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,080
schedule because

192
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,800
i remember the first night with finn was

193
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,800
a nightmare

194
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,560
fingers crossed that it'll be all good

195
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,080
i'll play a little bit more tonight

196
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,599
before we go to bed and then he will

197
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,360
knock out and be ready to go again

198
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,759

219
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:41,199
[Music]

224
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,440
day i am so excited that we actually

225
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,560
ended up getting him

226
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,440
wow the next day last night i did the

227
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,080
unthinkable

228
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,039
i had the pup sleep with me in my bed

229
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,479
because he's

230
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,840
so cute and so cuddly and he's been

231
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,680
really good about his potty training so

232
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:07,360
i wanted to see if he'd be able to

233
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,800
do it oh my gosh i wanted to see if he'd

234
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,160
be able to do it and spend the whole

235
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,879
night with me in bed and not go to the

236
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,199
bathroom and he did he's such a good boy

237
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,120
he is however a very very um like a

238
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,240
squirmish sleeper so we did wake up a

239
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,440
few different times in the middle of the

240
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,360
night just because he kept like

241
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,520
re-adjusting himself which was

242
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,280
a little annoying but other than that

243
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,410
you did a good job baby you did a good

244
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,680
job

245
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:33,520
[Applause]

246
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,520
this is not an optional assignment

247
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:45,680
he's so cute in fin

248
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:47,360
what oh do you want a bath now

249
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,680
or you just want to join the party i

250
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:55,839
think we need to make a double bath

251
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:55,839
you did this you did this

252
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:13,040
war oh no oh no

253
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,640
oh no oh oh

254
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,240
oh oh okay so obviously i talked about

255
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,600
how finn is like extremely attached to

256
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,440
lewis and i he's very very just

257
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,399
protective and loving but he's also not

258
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,720
an aggressive dog

259
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,880
literally at all like we've never even

260
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,080
heard finn growl like out of anger since

261
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,720
we got him which is

262
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,080
great but with the puppy the puppy's

263
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,600
obviously in his teething face because

264
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,120
he's only a few weeks old and he keeps

265
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,480
like biting me and lewis and i've

266
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,760
noticed whenever he starts like biting

267
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,279
me and i'll like say no

268
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,519
like just like push him away a little

269
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,279
bit finn will like come

270
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,880
walk in the middle of myself and the

271
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,040
puppy so the puppy like can't

272
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,120
get to me to bite me which is like i

273
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,000
think finn protecting me it really seems

274
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,560
like finn

275
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,279
is like honestly helping train the pup

276
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,800
which is like

277
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,839
makes my heart so happy and also like

278
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,320
the best thing that could have ever

279
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,600
happened

280
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,040
next time that that is like happening

281
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,760
i'll try to get it on camera because i

282
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,200
really would love

283
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,800
the input of you guys like anybody else

284
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,480
who has dogs out there to explain what's

285
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,120
going on i could be really overthinking

286
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,720
this but

287
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,160
i think finn is really like handling

288
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,079
this super super well

289
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,360
the next day all right you guys you've

290
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,680
been having a rough day with this little

291
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,079
one

292
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,680
so far he has not been the best angel

293
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,920
but i want to try and take him

294
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,200
swimming and see how that goes finn

295
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,480
hates the water and we're reading online

296
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,160
to see if it was safe for him we found

297
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,440
out that it's okay to start introducing

298
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,120
puppies to water around eight weeks

299
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,959
which is exactly how old he is

300
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,320
and my thought process is that hopefully

301
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,360
if we get him introduced to water

302
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,120
earlier on

303
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,560
he might like it labs and gold

304
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,120
retrievers are both really good natural

305
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,680
swimmers

306
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,839
so let's see hot tub is not on for

307
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,720
anyone wondering

308
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,720
we're not cooking him

309
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,959
oh my god he's good yeah that was really

310
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,279
good it's okay

311
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,480
oh i know you don't want to join we know

312
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,079
you can't tell if he likes it or not

313
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,760
he's like willingly swimming how do we

314
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,959
get our dogs to light the water can

315
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,240
somebody leave us a comment down below

316
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,720
and tell us how to warm our dogs up to

317
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,240
the water

318
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,480
finn's literally horrified and like this

319
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,240
one seems to be okay but i don't think

320
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,920
he's loving it oh he's not thrilled

321
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,600
maybe if you like hold his like

322
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,440
rib cage area and he can just practice

323
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,959
the motion finn's loving us he's getting

324
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,000
treats for doing nothing

325
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,279
hopefully whenever we're in the pool if

326
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,880
we just take the puppy in for a little

327
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,720
bit he'll get used to it and we'll enjoy

328
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,839
it and we'll definitely give you guys a

329
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:22,720
puff date on the swimming

the next day hello you guys so this

340
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,560
morning i had a cute little vlog clip of

341
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,399
me waking up with the pepper

342
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,920
he slept perfectly last night did not go

343
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,920
to the bathroom was an angel

344
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,760
and i have not filmed anything yet today

345
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,639
because um i've literally spent the

346
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,519
entire day

347
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:55,040
with this one trying to fix him because

348
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,000
oh boy the excitement that i had for how

349
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,839
well he was behaved

350
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,279
last night quickly diminished when he

351
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,959
decided to pee inside of the house

352
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,519
four different times today not once not

353
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:05,040
twice not thrice but

354
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,880
it's only two o'clock as well we are

355
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,000
super frustrated and also just confused

356
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,440
because for the past few days he's been

357
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,120
doing such a good job of using the

358
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,720
bathroom outside waiting for the door to

359
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,399
open but i don't know what it is

360
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,720
now he needs to go for redemption every

361
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:19,440
main character needs a redemption arc

362
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,880
lauren knows they've had mine so why is

363
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,639
he being so bad today

364
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,639
that is the name of a cartoon character

365
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,240
boy so the other dog has to match that

366
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,639
which is why i think theo is the perfect

367
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,680
name

368
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,480

369
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,360

it has been an insane past couple of

00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,600

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,680
work to do

393
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,279

definitely quite a lot easier but i'm

always down for a challenge and

396
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,399
that just means he's gonna be a very

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,079
very strong spirited individual
