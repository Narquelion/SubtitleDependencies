00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:07,890
James Charles here and welcome back to

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:14,929
our YouTube channel as you can see under

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:17,190
the day very special guest okay

5
00:00:14,929 --> 00:00:18,240
so for today's video we are doing a

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,560
wonderful idea

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,699
after you nights ago meeting and we're

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,350
sitting and talking and just having a

9
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:24,240
good and fresh time like the sisters

10
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,310
that we are and we were discussing our

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,480
first ever collabs on YouTube you're

12
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,130
talking about their first ever video

13
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,140
that we did together on my channel the

14
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,570
introduction of sister yen which was him

15
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,790
doing my makeup and why not that that he

16
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,050
was brought up in discussion Ian said I

17
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,790
could easily pick out your makeup

18
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,739
products and probably do a good job

19
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,600
because you know make a profession on

20
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:44,129
that or just like you what exactly makes

21
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,260
me think that I would love to know me

22
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:48,420
and we did that video did the woman I

23
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,100
did my own makeup I was you for a day

24
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,199
I've said a lot of experience around

25
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,570
makeup now so you know so she's cocky

26
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:56,430
you love a cocky sister really Dale

27
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,020
honestly I will admit when he entered

28
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,300
his own makeup for the life swap series

29
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,579
he did do a a pretty decent job but

30
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,470
since the first video that we film every

31
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:06,090
single time I have picked out the

32
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,770
products for Ian to use and put that

33
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:09,570
much knocked up in front of him every

34
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,159
single step taken care of and walked him

35
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,920
through the actual makeup application

36
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,570
process okay yes but I've had experience

37
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,040
so I remembered the names and like what

38
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,229
you need you think you're everything I

39
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,060
think I remember every product not like

40
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:24,150
the brands and what type think I know

41
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,979
what you need just don't know who well

42
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,680
that's great it has first today's video

43
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:30,270
I had the novel idea to have Ian go to

44
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,640
the makeup store with my credit card

45
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:34,079
puts already scary thought so yeah it's

46
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,420
gonna be picking out all of my makeup

47
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,430
and then I'm going to have to use that

48
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,570
makeup and do it this video concept

49
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,799
really doesn't seem as exciting when you

50
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,930
really lay it down it's gonna be

51
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,670
exciting right now can you quickly list

52
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,500

53
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:50,899

brow gel or pencil and lipstick just

61
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:11,700
because you have the stops down does not

62
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,510
mean that you know what products to get

63
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,920
or buy shades

64
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:15,900
oh yeah Shea's another thing let me

65
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,470
guess more like kind of the same like

66
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:21,030
shades on the face so not really I'll go

67
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:22,709
like one thing lighter than what I think

68
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:24,510
works for me okay

69
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:25,650
so I did like a color coordinated look -

70
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:27,600

00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:29,850

00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:36,220
let's get my brow pencil is there

127
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:40,730
different shades in these two oh my gosh

128
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:44,660
sure yeah I think he likes liquid

129
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:47,180
lipstick so this is nude kisses okay

130
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:50,270
yeah so we got this so far we got liquid

131
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:53,210
lipstick brow pencil foundation than a

132
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:56,510
primer we still need mascara eye shadow

133
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:58,130
powder and concealer what type of look

134
00:04:56,510 --> 00:05:02,660
is he going for he didn't give me any

135
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:05,090
ideas he just said buy me makeup sorry

136
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:07,190
so got the eye shadow I think he's gonna

137
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:10,160
want to use more like the pinkish tones

138
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:11,570
it's a matching with the lipstick I'm

139
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,130
smart right now I really should have

140
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:13,370
looked at his makeup room before I came

141
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:15,169
here

142
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:18,710
cuz I don't know any brands that he uses

143
00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:22,540
I haven't even seen concealer anywhere I

144
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:22,540
know what it was Urban Decay settings

145
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,960
Urban Decay settings retinue it that's a

146
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:28,720
thing okay

147
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:30,670
tart shake Cape where you at so I think

148
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,400
concealer has to be lighter than the

149
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:36,610
foundation to a certain extent if I'm

150
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,650
correct ban medium sand sounds about

151
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:42,160
right

152
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:45,970
soft light blend powder it's just hiding

153
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:48,280
powder I think yeah set in Africa so we

154
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,510
got some setting powder from Becca James

155
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,000
I feel like I'm not getting the right

156
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:53,350
brands and they're gonna get mad at me

157
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,160
but I'm sorry I'm trying my best here

158
00:05:53,350 --> 00:06:04,800
so mascara the lashes in a highlighter

159
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:08,200
and I think we're done oh okay okay

160
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,360
mascara maybe he uses this brand burning

161
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:12,220
it black no matter what's probably think

162
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,740
mascara matters that much especially

163
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:17,260
he's gonna put lashes on so let me grab

164
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:19,300
one of these ultra black pigments okay

165
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:21,070
we got black mascara where is it lashes

166
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:23,950
at I need some Miami's I don't know what

167
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:26,470
brand that is but I need my Eunice here

168
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:28,270
all the washes I don't see Miami's how

169
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:30,220
do you pick out good eyelashes I don't

170
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:32,080
know what friends are good I don't know

171
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:34,030
they seem pretty cheap I honestly don't

172
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,390
know then these are good what about

173
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:36,390
these

174
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,590
to go with these he's looking about the

175
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:45,800
right length and James always cuts him

176
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:47,990
anyways these look good we got brow gel

177
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,660
I think he needs this so I'm gonna throw

178
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:52,790
that in there welcome James and its new

179
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:57,680
bronzer it shouldn't be this difficult

180
00:06:52,790 --> 00:07:02,060
what is this okay this is our

181
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:04,670
highlighter matches with the nation of

182
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:08,180
the other stuff okay bronzer and I think

183
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:09,530
we're did smells like peaches maybe

184
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,770
James wants someone else ones like

185
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,770
peaches

186
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:21,890
now we're getting this two-faced

187
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:23,690
smells like peaches BAM I think that is

188
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:25,310
everything I don't know how I did I know

189
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:26,900
I got all the right products I don't

190
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:28,220
know about the brands or the colors or

191
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:36,820
how well it's gonna work together but

192
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:39,800
we'll see James good luck man okay guys

I picked all the products and now I have

194
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,550
everything he needs but I don't think

195
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:46,220
it's the right brands but I think he can

196
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:55,450
make it work James I tried my best man

197
00:07:46,220 --> 00:08:01,160

198
00:07:55,450 --> 00:08:03,100
I like knew what to get brands or what

199
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:05,390

00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:07,160

shopping buried today alright guys so

258
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,550
you just left the house to do some more

259
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:41,290
assists are shopping for tonight's

260
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:42,760
festivities I have all just products

261
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:45,220
laid out here in front of me I am

262
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,900
nervous for this because I literally

263
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:48,850
don't use a single one of these products

264
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:50,950
in my everyday makeup routine and also

265
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:52,840
disappointed because evil is very very

266
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:54,100
convinced that he knew every single

267
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,810
product that I used and it was honestly

268
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,520
getting a little bit excited and really

269
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:59,620
happy that he felt like he knew my

270
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:01,420
makeup routine but we are going to make

271
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,620
it work and I appreciate him still

272
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:04,270
shopping in the first place it's the

273
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,650
thought that counts and I'm going to now

274
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:07,120
think that I have some sort of talent

275
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:08,920
and I'm gonna make that thought count

276
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,800
and make this look count because I have

277
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:13,720
to get ready and I have to go so let's

278
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,890
do this if you've got a long time sister

279
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,530
you would know that I used to use this

280
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:19,420
primer and literally every single video

281
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:21,010
but when I would also talk about in

282
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:23,080
every single video was my foundation

283
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:25,060
that's slipping off my nose and after a

284
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,590
literal year of trying to fix the

285
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:28,210
problem I realized that it was this

286
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:29,770
primer and the ingredients in it that

287
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:31,420
were causing my foundation to dissipate

288
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:33,310
on my sister schnoz so that is why I

289
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:35,170
stopped using this a very very long time

290
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:36,850
ago but it's still a good primer so I'm

291
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:38,320
gonna put this on tonight and I am NOT

292
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:40,180
gonna put it on my nose I'm only gonna

293
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:44,910
focus this right here in the rankings

294
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:44,910
that my pores are a little bit there so

295
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:50,470
for foundation we're gonna be using the

296
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:52,480
new benefit hello flawless foundation in

00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:54,570

I I just want to use that let's do a few

306
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:14,830
squirts and see how this looks okay

307
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:16,630

decent shade match Thank You Ian at

309
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:19,300
least for the you guys know I really

310
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:21,340
don't switch out my products that often

311
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,090
but the one thing that I really don't

312
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,710
ever change

313
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:25,330
is it foundation I've talked about this

314
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:26,529
before but I use had really bad skin

315
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:27,850
young credit I'm still a little bit

316
00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:29,470
self-conscious about it and always want

317
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:31,089
my skin to look very very porcelain a

318
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:32,470
doll like using a new foundation is

319
00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:33,459
always a little bit of a risky moment

320
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,990
because you never know the type of

321
00:12:33,459 --> 00:12:36,430
coverage or how it's gonna wear or how

322
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:37,630
it's gonna look throughout the day or

323
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:38,890
how it's gonna photograph ideally

324
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:40,480
foundation is just really one of those

325
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:42,220
things that can totally make or break

326
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,510
your entire makeup look so I would just

327
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:45,100
rather not risk it

328
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:49,600
but looks like Ted risking yes that's

329
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:51,579
good where it's at right now I would not

330
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,899
choose to wear this again but keeping an

331
00:12:51,579 --> 00:12:54,670
open mind I want to finish this look

332
00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:56,680
before I make any comments next step

333
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:58,329
Taric creaseless concealer I have not

334
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,920
tried this one yet because shape is my

335
00:12:58,329 --> 00:13:01,899
hour late or die I know this one

336
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:07,959
just launched so let's try this out and

337
00:13:01,899 --> 00:13:09,399
see oh oh my god this is so thick like

338
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:11,910
me oh my god this concealer is also

339
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:11,910
yellow

340
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,210
this concealer is pretty much the same

341
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:23,370
exact shade as my skintone it's just a

342
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:25,020
little bit more yellow that's a little

343
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:27,060
bit scary to me as someone who really

344
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:28,470
likes to have a lot of contrast in their

345
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:31,110
makeup I guess I'm just got a contour my

346
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:39,060
face a lot wait

347
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:45,720

00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,880
and somebody will say on Twitter and it

354
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:03,750
go viral and create another beam

355
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:04,950

00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:15,529

you're literally kidding me next up is

371
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:55,180

372
00:14:54,220 --> 00:15:00,970
don't have

373
00:14:55,180 --> 00:15:06,129

374
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:09,040
shade I'm gonna work out this this is

375
00:15:06,129 --> 00:15:11,350

to grab a highlighting brush now this is

388
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:44,290
the M of 501 and I'm going to open up

390
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:48,310
into the highlighting shade right here

391
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:49,720

392
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:52,389
highlighter we have three highlighters

393
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:54,639
oh the Becca one the free sample okay

394
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:58,809
let's do what the peach one mixed

395
00:15:54,639 --> 00:16:01,029
together with Becca opal gonna go the

396
00:15:58,809 --> 00:16:03,129
benefit goof proof brow pencil you got

397
00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:09,459
the shade number 4 thank God that is a

398
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:12,399
shade that I actually do use oh my god

399
00:16:09,459 --> 00:16:15,540
they look so uneven I never been makeup

400
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,540
again this is fun a PSI

401
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:20,230
Wow now my brows are all filled in and

402
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:22,449
looking probably the worst they've ever

403
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:24,370
looked thank God for benefit gimme brow

404
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:27,420
so we can set them in place and how they

405
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:27,420
last all night long

406
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:34,810
okay it's eyeshadow time we have these

407
00:16:31,209 --> 00:16:38,709
shades we have two mats and one two and

408
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:40,389
six shimmers why I'm first gonna grab

409
00:16:38,709 --> 00:16:45,040
this mauve shade that I used to

410
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:46,959
literally contour my face okay

411
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,980
next in to grab an AB 507 brush and this

412
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,139
is where things are gonna get really

413
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:51,759
tricky because the only other option for

414
00:16:50,139 --> 00:16:56,980
a matte shade in this palette is this

415
00:16:51,759 --> 00:17:00,819
dark brown why I do not know Oh what my

416
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:05,470
god I am now going to not panic and I'm

417
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:08,110
going to blend this out okay that looks

418
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:10,120
okay gonna grab the Becca highlighter as

419
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:11,740
well on the same approach that I just

420
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:13,750
used to cut that I'm gonna wet it for a

421
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:16,299
real one and I'm gonna try it to attempt

422
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:19,720
to fix this because I am now freaking

423
00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:21,579
out and this is not funny anymore okay

424
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,470
that helped great taking the rosy shade

425
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:27,610
from the middle of the palette I'm gonna

426
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:32,260
place that next door next to get this

427
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:35,049
liner from buxom this is a metallic grey

428
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,409
brown liner it keeps getting worse and

429
00:17:35,049 --> 00:17:37,630
worse

430
00:17:35,409 --> 00:17:41,320
what does this even look like it's

431
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:43,240
broken great that is what it looks like

432
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,919
I am not using that liner because one

433
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,750
it's broken and I'm Julia sharpen it and

434
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:48,909
two it already looks bad enough and I

435
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:51,100
don't want to make it even worse so I'm

436
00:17:48,909 --> 00:17:53,080
gonna fly to Lancome mom's your big

437
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,340
mascara I think this one it's actually

438
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,960
okay I still have not try this but

439
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:58,900
fingers crossed we'll have one good

440
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:05,020
moment out of this entire look

441
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:07,030
I am going to put on an eyelash these

442
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:09,520
are the islur at vegas night eyelashes

443
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:12,190
and I will say that a good lash can

444
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:14,140
really save a lot usually when filming

445
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:16,330
my videos it is a little bit of a bumpy

446
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:18,100
road to get to the final product am i

447
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:20,260
exaggerating my complaining a little bit

448
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:21,670
yes but is the end result

449
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:24,790
always redeemable and telling that I'm

450
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:26,680
proud of yes this is not that I don't

451
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:27,880
want to say this looks the worse and I

452
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,590
don't know how to fix it because I don't

453
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,270
have any product options to fix eyes

454
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:32,830
because of this challenge I am gonna go

455
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:34,450
do the other eye off-camera now because

456
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:35,620
I'm running very late and I have to walk

457
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:37,120
out the door in a few short minutes and

458
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:39,550
my face currently looks probably the

459
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,990
worst it's ever looked so I will be back

460
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:45,040
in a few short madness to finish off the

461
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:46,710
rest of the luck thanks BRB ok so we are

462
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:49,690
back and the other eye is looking

463
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:51,190
equally as bad so I'm going to take the

464
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:52,630
Becca highlighter that yeah literally

465
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,900
did not even buy it happen to get for

466
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:55,360
free

467
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:57,190
I don't going to reapply this for some

468
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,540
glow - hopefully distract and then we're

469
00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:01,600
going to complete our look and that is

470
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:04,270
the laura geller nude kisses lip hugging

471
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,420
lip gloss at least the lip matches the

472
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:06,940
eye

473
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:09,630
thank you Lord Jesus and heaven above oh

474
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:09,630

475
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:14,279
and we're going to finish off this

476

Decay all nighter D slick setting sprays

479
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:22,369
[Music]

480
00:19:25,009 --> 00:19:33,779
holy a little bit you think

481
00:19:30,929 --> 00:19:36,570
eyelashes really big and wonky doesn't

482
00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:38,519
work yeah face a little creased a little

483
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:41,249
crusty you can see through your pores

484
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:44,100
yeah do cat's eye brows a little big

485
00:19:41,249 --> 00:19:45,509
lips a little crusty overall a pretty

486
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,100
awful job on my part

487
00:19:45,509 --> 00:19:48,840
the sad thing is too is that this

488
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,490
doesn't even look that bad on camera so

489
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:52,019
all the comments are gonna be oh my god

490
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:57,899
damn stop complaining like do you look

491
00:19:52,019 --> 00:19:59,580
fine it is currently 622 and there is a

492
00:19:57,899 --> 00:20:02,519
car coming to get us for the event and

493
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:03,269
approximately eight minutes what I don't

494
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:05,369
know that

495
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:07,320
yeah you need to get ready tail and I

496
00:20:05,369 --> 00:20:09,450
look like this so that is neither good

497
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:11,220
nor flash nor fine and I am really

498
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:12,629
scared we'll see first problem you did

499
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:14,190
you should have started filming earlier

500
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:15,779
so it didn't work out well he could have

501
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:17,789
done an actual look it made me so happy

502
00:20:15,779 --> 00:20:21,269
and so Kaunas an older brother that you

503
00:20:17,789 --> 00:20:23,220
were so confident in your I was calm

504
00:20:21,269 --> 00:20:28,169
well I had trusted you to take out

505
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:30,570
things that I would wear I know I'm very

506
00:20:28,169 --> 00:20:32,220
thankful that you did this and I'm also

507
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:34,499
very impressed that you at least knew

508
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:36,480
all the different steps and it kind of a

509
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:38,639
guy like three hours you did and you

510
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,110
also missed contouring but most things

511
00:20:38,639 --> 00:20:41,970
are there and the fact that you even

512
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:42,869
know about makeup in the first place is

513
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:47,100
enough

00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:45,380
we originally launched our show and

548
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,940
brother and sister here on YouTube it

549
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:48,710
was kind of like our trial run with you

550
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:50,660
guys and literally the support on it was

551
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:52,250
so insane we had so much fun doing the

552
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:54,110
series and that was kind of like in the

553
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:55,400
beginning stages of Vienna coming to LA

554
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:57,620
spending a lot more time with me and

555
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:59,360
it's us being together and we had so

556
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:00,650
much fun doing the episodes too it was

557
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,880
truly like such an amazing bonding

558
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:03,170
experience for us a lot went on behind

559
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,760
the scenes and Ian was also in school

560
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:06,650
which made producing the episodes a

561
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:08,780
little bit of a struggle for Shore but

562
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:10,070
it's a summertime Ian's back in LA and

563
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:11,420
we're kind of figuring out what he wants

564
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:12,650
to do with this career and it's looking

565
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:14,450
like online school is gonna be a really

566
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:16,130
amazing option to Meramec which means

567
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:18,770
brother and sister is officially making

568
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:20,420
a comeback and we are so pumped they

569
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:21,530
decided to upload episodes once every

570
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:23,420

571
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:24,830
