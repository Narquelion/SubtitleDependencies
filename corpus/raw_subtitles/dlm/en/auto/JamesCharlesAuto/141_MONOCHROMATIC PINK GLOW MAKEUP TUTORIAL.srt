00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,509
hi guys James Charles here and welcome

4
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:27,070
back to my youtube channel this past

5
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:29,140
weekend I went to generation Beauty and

6
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:30,460
Los Angeles and I got to see everybody

7
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:32,680
and I got to meet so many of you guys

8
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:34,540
which was so much fun for today's look I

9
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:37,629
decided to do this monochromatic pink

10
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:39,010
glowing glam I love this look this is

11
00:00:37,629 --> 00:00:40,809
what I were to generation Beauty at this

12
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:42,129
past weekend and so many of you guys are

13
00:00:40,809 --> 00:00:44,140
asking questions about so I figured I

14
00:00:42,129 --> 00:00:45,460
would sit down and do tutorial like I

15
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,989
said in my last video I have not done

16
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:48,670
any creative look in a long time and

17
00:00:46,989 --> 00:00:49,839
let's be real one colors and the most

18
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:52,420
creative thing in the world but at least

19
00:00:49,839 --> 00:00:53,710
it's not everyday wearable glam trust me

20
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,239
we'll be getting into more conceptual

21
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:57,280
crazy look soon especially with

22
00:00:55,239 --> 00:00:58,360
Coachella coming up but for now if you

23
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,549
guys want to see how I created this look

24
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:02,170
make sure you would keep on watching I'm

25
00:01:00,549 --> 00:01:03,670
first gonna start off by priming my face

26
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:06,790
as always with my benefit Porefessional

27
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:10,000
primer nothing new just sloppiness on

28
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:11,140
over to get a nice and smooth base her

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,600
foundation today I'm actually gonna be

30
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:15,310
trying a new combination I am very very

31
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,070
excited for this one of my friends

32
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:20,350
recommended this combo to me and he

33
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:22,900
always looks so freaking bomb with the

34
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:24,189
most beautiful flawless skin so I just

35
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,840
went to support earlier on tonight and

36
00:01:24,189 --> 00:01:28,180
everything up and we're gonna do a

37
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,430
little bit of mixing I'm gonna use my

38
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:32,950
Giorgio Armani a luminous sub foundation

39
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:34,210
in the shade 3.5 this is way too dark

40
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:36,360
for me so I'm gonna be mixing it with

41
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:38,650
the Urban Decay Naked skin in the shade

42
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:41,260
2.5 and then the bare minerals

43
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:42,580
complexion rescue in opal which is the

44
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:46,659
lightest shade so hopefully that'll like

45
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:49,150
even everything out I guess well this is

46
00:01:46,659 --> 00:01:51,700
very liquidy yeah oh wow oh this looks

47
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:57,310
gross until apply this today I will be

48
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:58,390
using my morphe 48 brush ok I'm

49
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:02,040
switching to a Beauty Blender I just

50
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:02,040
could not do the whole brush situation

51
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,850
alright I'm not too sure how I feel

52
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,170
about this just yet this is the first

53
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:10,239
time I've ever mixed foundations

54
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:12,549
I like the coverage is giving me it's

55
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,440
like a nice natural coverage not sure if

56
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,940
I'd like the texture but then again my

57
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,860
face is already really textured to begin

58
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:20,379
so I'm not really sure if it's just me

59
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:22,390
like imagining worst texture or like if

60
00:02:20,379 --> 00:02:23,890
there's I don't know well I'm just gonna

61
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:25,150
keep going and see what it feels like

62
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,379
later on we're gonna see though I'm

63
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:28,540
gonna use of course my fav the

64
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:30,340
heart-shaped tape I use a lot less

65
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:32,500
concealer than normal today I want my

66
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:33,760
skin to look like really natural and

67
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,620
like really do

68
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,470
and Chloe with this look not as like

69
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:39,940
cakey like my normal everyday makeup

70
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:41,830
alright so overall actually really

71
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:47,080
liking how this is looking I didn't pre

72
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:48,340
oh sometimes take it back and then I'm

73
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,870
gonna stand under my eyes by Laura

74
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:52,000
Mercier secret under-eye brightening

75
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:53,620
powder well that's a mouthful

76
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,030
the foundation is separating a little

77
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,650
bit in the nose region but I mean are we

78
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:58,870
really surprised that gets Jim Charles

79
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:01,180
knows I have to pre prime like 15 layers

80
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:02,920
anyway to begin with so this is no

81
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:07,629
shocker I'm gonna really lightly dust

82
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:10,750
away the Laura Mercier powder oh that I

83
00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:11,440
don't like oh you just took a turn for

84
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,269
the worst

85
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,890
am I seeing things I feel like I'm just

86
00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:16,120
so used to my makeup forever stick at

87
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:18,370
this point that anything else is just

88
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,900
gonna look so strange to me I'm probably

89
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,519
just over exaggerating like I said I'm

90
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,299
just gonna keep going we'll figure it

91
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,890
out later

92
00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:25,660
Gibran's today I'm using the middle

93
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:28,810
shade of the Kat Von D shade lamp out of

94
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:30,819
my morphe M 435 I did just buy a new

95
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:32,200
palette at Sephora earlier on today but

96
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:34,239
I'm gonna get all the way out of this

97
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,069
one that I possibly can I feel like this

98
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,319
secret under-eye brightening powder may

99
00:03:36,069 --> 00:03:41,590
have secretly brightened up my under-eye

100
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:44,410
a little bit too much Laura Mercier girl

101
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:45,790
I trust that you and since the

102
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:47,560
foundation on my nose is separating a

103
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:50,440
little bit I'm going to lightly and I

104
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,510
mean super super lightly try to contour

105
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,519
my nose using my own 4-3-3 this is just

106
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:55,810
a normal blending brush a lot of you

107
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:57,220
guys asked to and what I do my nose

108
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:59,049
contour I always like to bring that

109
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:00,760
shadow just the tiniest bit into my brow

110
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:01,569
bone region it always looks kind of

111
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,609
strange if you have like a really

112
00:04:01,569 --> 00:04:04,690
pinched nose contour going like all the

113
00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:06,220
way up the bridge and then also just

114
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:07,630
like stops here so I always like to

115
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,669
blend it just a little bit open to like

116
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:11,349
the socket brow region just to kind of

117
00:04:09,669 --> 00:04:14,889
make everything continuous and flow and

118
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:15,760
look as natural as we can get to start

119
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:17,410
off my brows I'm gonna be using my

120
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,840
benefit precisely my brow pencil in the

121
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:22,030
shade number 5 for this particular look

122
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,889
I'm keeping my brows super fluffy and

123
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:26,200
almost like natural I want them to be

124
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:28,300
very very like editorial but she push

125
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,770
top so I'm doing them the same way I did

126
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:32,169
in my last video the everyday makeup

127
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:34,810
routine just sketching in hairs and then

128
00:04:32,169 --> 00:04:36,520
brushing upwards to blend them out I'm

129
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:38,560
gonna super lightly conceal and clean up

130
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,240
that browsing my e43 and its shape tape

131
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,680
concealer and then just the tiniest bit

132
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,669
of benefit gimme brow to brush the hairs

133
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,669
upwards and keep them in place

134
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:50,500
okay Wow for once I'm actually loving

135
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:51,760
how this bra is turning out maybe today

136
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,550
will be a good makeup day unlike the

137
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,900
last video I said very very similar to

138
00:04:54,550 --> 00:05:00,070
my everyday makeup routine bras just

139
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:01,300
light fluffy and natural sort of to

140
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:02,500
prime my lids for shadow I'm just gonna

141
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,600
use a little bit more of that shape tape

142
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,580
concealer and then just setting those

143
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,650
lives in place using my at a 45 for more

144
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:10,150
P and my yet Cody ayersman powder come

145
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:12,460
on guys you know me how to fit it in

146
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:14,410
there somewhere for eyeshadow today I'm

147
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:16,270
gonna start off with my m4 for one from

148
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:18,280
morphe and the makeup geek single shadow

149
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:19,930
in the shade Ben I'm really lightly

150
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,850
placing this in the crease and on the

151
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:24,940
lid just making a kind of really blown

152
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:27,280
out pinky a cool toned red smokey eye

153
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:30,010
only go to use me I think like probably

154
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,660
one or two shadows for this entire color

155
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:33,400
and you could totally switch this up to

156
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:35,620
be any color that your heart desires I

157
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,690
just chose to do pink today grabbing

158
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,160
that same exact shadow on an m4 33 I'm

159
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:41,290
going to deepen up the lid and just

160
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,730
blend that into the crease and I'm also

161
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:46,510
using that brush in the same shape to

162
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:48,550
begin of shading my lower lash line for

163
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:49,810
the later I'm gonna spreads my ab 705

164
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:51,220
with a little bit of Urban Decay all

165
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:53,669
nighter setting spray and then I'm going

166
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:56,740
to use the untamed pressed pigment oh

167
00:05:53,669 --> 00:05:58,630
wow that is so pretty and then going

168
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:03,430
back into my m4 33 to blend out the

169
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:05,050
edges okay I just did the other eye off

170
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,970
camera so we can save some time and not

171
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:08,680
be sitting here for a million years now

172
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:10,210
normally next I would do lashes but I'm

173
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,560
gonna kind of skip around and change up

174
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:14,050
the order a little bit for this

175
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,700
particular look taking Miami 5 on I'm

176
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:17,800
gonna dip into a little bit more of that

177
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:19,600
bit in a shadow I'm actually gonna be

178
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,370
using this eyeshadow for blush and it's

179
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,110
just a powder so it'll totally work and

180
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:24,400
I would normally use a blush but I don't

181
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:26,110
really have anything that'll match is

182
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,790
the exact color and I want this entire

183
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:29,680
thing to be monochromatic and really

184
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:31,600
really cohesive I'm gonna super lightly

185
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,220
dust this color over my cheekbones where

186
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,990
I would normally put my blush and my

187
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,669
highlighter as well so the two will mix

188
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:38,020
together next I'm gonna go to this

189
00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:38,590
highlighter from a star crush minerals

190
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,930
in the shade

191
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:42,070
rosy future these products are so Bob

192
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:43,720
and I don't think I've talked about them

193
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:45,520
on my channel before I used to have a

194
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,770
code and expired but now it's back so I

195
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,750
wanted to feature this today if you use

196
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:51,970
code James on the ropes that you get 50%

197
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:53,500
off all products this video is not

198
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:55,060
sponsored I promise I just love

199
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,289
featuring brands that I love and support

200
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,090
especially the ones that are cheap

201
00:06:56,289 --> 00:06:59,010
because I know

202
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:00,960
expensive makeup can be these guys are

203
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:02,220
four frickin dollars with the code and

204
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,080
I'm pretty sure they're single shadows

205
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:05,070
or like a dollar and fifty cents it's a

206
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,150
really good deal for really great

207
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,500
products and if you haven't checked them

208
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:09,090
out you totally should

209
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,889
oh that's what I'm freaking talking

210
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:12,150
about I obviously packed at Emma glow on

211
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:13,500
the cheek and I'm also gonna put it

212
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:15,690
underneath the brow bone and in the

213
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,680
inner corner and just as a side note I

214
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:18,090
would definitely recommend applying

215
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,729
these highlighters with a wet brush

216
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:21,750
using a tiny I'm 515 detail brush so I'm

217
00:07:20,729 --> 00:07:23,430
going in with a little bit more of a

218
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,570
highlighter with a wet brush and I'm

219
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:30,450
just gonna intensify at the inner

220
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:35,160
corners I'm also going to use this brush

221
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:37,110
to highlight my nose next I'm gonna go

222
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,400
back into my blush brush in my in shade

223
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:39,570
and just go right over the blush and

224
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,530
highlighter again to make sure they are

225
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:44,610
nice and blended together to line my

226
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:46,229
waterlines today I'm going to use the

227
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:48,000
makeup rubber lip pencil in the shade of

228
00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:52,070
20 this is just a pink liner that is

229
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,070
hopefully safe for the waterline I

230
00:07:54,979 --> 00:07:58,470
honestly wish it didn't unrest gear up

231
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:00,389
but now that I did there's no going back

232
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:02,190
so I'm gonna pop on the Lily lashes in

233
00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:08,460
the style Lux just so it doesn't look

234
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:10,410
funky so since I did everything out of

235
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,610
like a weird order I guess everything is

236
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:13,650
kind of done except for the lips which

237
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:14,580
is strange this feels really awkward I

238
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:16,680
feel like I've been million more things

239
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,940
to do but I guess we're done to be

240
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,680
perfectly honest this foundation

241
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:21,900
combination is not my favorite I do feel

242
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,490
pretty cakey but at least I tried

243
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,479
something new for all you guys that were

244
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:26,910
complaining I'll be using the same

245
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,110
products you're freaking welcome back to

246
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:30,389
the makeup forever stick for the next

247
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:31,530
video I don't really know what I want to

248
00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:33,390
do with the lips for this look but my

249
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:36,029
first instinct is I need to block them

250
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:36,990
out and then do highlighter so I'm going

251
00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:39,209
to try that first

252
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:42,560
mmm okay I hate this let me find a lip

253
00:08:39,209 --> 00:08:42,560
color and I'll be right back

254
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:52,080
oh okay yes much better I just applied

255
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,019
my over liquid lipstick in the shade the

256
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,760
Bronx is my morphe 1 6 0 - 1/8 fresh

257
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:58,260
it's just a liner brush I always usually

258
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,670
do my black lips like with a liner brush

259
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,920
just because it's so much easier and

260
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:04,769
once you mess up you can never go back

261
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,329
so better to be safe rather than sorry

262
00:09:04,769 --> 00:09:07,470
once my lipstick has dried down I'm

263
00:09:06,329 --> 00:09:08,490
gonna go in once again with that soy

264
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:10,649
crushed minerals highlighter and my

265
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:11,880
morphe 705 brush to pack that oughta

266
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:13,860
make a metallic lip

267
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,170
alright guys and this is the completed a

268
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,339
monochromatic pink glam for today I'm

270
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:20,339
monochromatic one color glow thing it

271
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:22,320
was really fun to just sit down and

272
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:23,970
experiment like I said in my last video

273
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,790
I have not had time to do any creative

274
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:27,510
looks in a long long time so this is so

275
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:29,339
fun to do

276
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:31,560

277
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:33,269

281
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:39,839
