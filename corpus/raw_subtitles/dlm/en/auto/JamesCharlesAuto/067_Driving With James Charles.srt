00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,140
hi sisters James Charles here and

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:05,910
welcome back 22 Channel okay you guys I

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,710
am so beyond excited for today's brand

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:09,510
new video as you can see we are not in

5
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,309
the normal YouTube studio setting I am

6
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:13,230
outside in front of my garage because

7
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:16,289
for today's video in case you did not

8
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,880
know I recently bought a car for my

9
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:19,050
first time ever here in Los Angeles I

10
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,910
have been driving for the past few weeks

11
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,020
and is pretty fun and good and fresh so

12
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:25,439
far I have not died yet

13
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,220
which is surprising to me and I'm really

14
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,420
happy about that

15
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,010
aside from the car there's been a lot of

16
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,660
other amazing things going on and if you

17
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,669
guys did not know we recently just had

18
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,020
10 million sisters here on this YouTube

19
00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:35,579
channel there are so many new sisters

20
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,200
here in the family and I apparently have

21
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:38,940
not done a Q&A video in literally over a

22
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,410
year now I don't know how that happened

23
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,730
but for today I thought I'd be so much

24
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,440
fun to show you guys my brand new car

25
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,300
hop in the Tesla and go for a little bit

26
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,020
of a ride while talking about all things

27
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,629
in my life

28
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:51,120
boys drama makeup my palette and a whole

29
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:53,750
lot more so without further ado let's go

30
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:59,050
dry with me I don't we not die

31
00:00:53,750 --> 00:01:08,950

this is the brand-new 2018 a Tesla Model

34
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,120
X set seven people for myself and all my

35
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:37,430
family whenever we are whipping it

36
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,140
around here in California together the

37
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,880
car can block would actually just got it

38
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,380
painted my sticker City here in

39
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,000
California there and literally the bus

40
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,710
and the entire will be finished this so

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,740
quickly and it looks literally

42
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:49,670
incredible just got new black rims thank

43
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,770
God because they were very very

44
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:53,270
prescient and gross before and I

45
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:54,890
literally and love with this car you

46
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:56,720
guys I don't want to get the windows

47
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:58,730
tinted for a little bit more privacy but

48
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,260
I thought we should be better driving

49
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:02,240
before I do that and then I died so

50
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:03,830
without further ado the Sun is going

51
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,300
down which is so incredibly rude at

52
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:06,620
daylight savings time it just happens we

53
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,810
only have a little bit of suddenly left

54
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:10,760
first and I sound let's help any go for

55
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:12,080
a ride all right so three seconds and we

56
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,490
weren't recording but we just missed a

57
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,550
stop sign so it's off to a really good

58
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:20,240
start by the way my best friend drew was

59
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:22,940
behind the camera the questions that I

60
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:25,790
just so you know you can ask yourself

61
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:27,290
the question so that is very true oh I

62
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:28,610
thought it'd be fun tuned for a cute I

63
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,930
actually did not pick out these

64
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:31,430
questions for today's video I asked you

65
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:32,480
guys to tweet me on Twitter by the way

66
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,860
if you don't follow me on Twitter

67
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,060
probably should actually ask drew to go

68
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,739
out there and pick out the most like

69
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,850
liked questions that you guys all want

70
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:40,330
on house little kind of like a sister

71
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:40,330
surprise

72
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:45,540
the class excuse me ma'am I'm gonna need

73
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,010
you to wait your turn

74
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,780
thank you very much as you'll notice we

75
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:51,960
have GoPros on the windshield and Druce

76
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,280
only I refuse to text and drive use my

77
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,680
phone while driving to do anything while

78
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,190
driving I think it is so stupid so don't

79
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,840
do that please

80
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:01,050
literally Everett and the first question

81
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,670
is from Emily are you ever going to be

82
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,840
getting a dog if so what would you name

83
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:05,970
it love you sister

84
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,350
definitely okay so now that I have a

85
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:08,490
house which is literally the best thing

86
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:10,170
in the entire movement they were unable

87
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:11,370
to come over all the time in my manager

88
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:12,840
and assistant work out of the house

89
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:14,400
every single day and obviously sister

90
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,709
Ian listen me now too which is a pizza

91
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,000
bass so it's always a full house I've

92
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:19,980
always wanted a dog since I moved to

93
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,030
California but I never wanted to get a

94
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:23,400
dollar when I was living downtown

95
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:25,920
because I was not home not often and it

96
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,380
was only me so as such as I loved a dog

97
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,670
literally like animal cruelty to leave a

98
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,709
dog in that girl's apartment all day

99
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:35,130
long and not be able to walk in in

100
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:36,390
downtown so now absolutely I'm doing a

101
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,980
lot of traveling in the next few months

102
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:39,390
but as soon as everything settles down I

103
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:42,420
will definitely be a top date and I am

104
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:44,670
so got excited as for the name I'm going

105
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:46,680
to see the dog first away yeah leave

106
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:47,190
comments below with me mate yes oh yeah

107
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,780
definitely

108
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:50,190
I really want to get something with a

109
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,080
husky Matt it's like really really badly

110
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:54,030
consenting Huskies are the cutest butt

111
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,680
both Grayson and my dad and a lot of

112
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:57,600
other my close friends are really really

113
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,850
allergic to dogs so I think I need to

114
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:02,519
get a hypoallergenic one so if you have

115
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:04,080
any really great breed suggestions let

116
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:05,280
Kitty go now here we're gonna use our

117
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,410
phone on one side since the camera

118
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,580
literally already died one seconds of

119
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:11,670
the videos you love how good at

120
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:13,459
youtubing I am honestly like never use a

121
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:16,229
vlog camera though no because all my

122
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:18,540
videos are in a professional studio yeah

123
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:21,060
good time okay next question is from

124
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:23,070
Audrey how what is your favorite beauty

125
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,690
guru palette other than your own there

126
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,950
are a lot of really really good ones one

127
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:27,210
of my favorite you can't makeup artist a

128
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:29,070
see Marie I'm you I actually just

129
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:31,230
collaborated with I think be perfect

130
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:33,150
created a beautiful rainbow palette so

131
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:36,290
other than mine I would have to say hers

132
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:39,660
basically because it's a very similar

133
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:41,640
Drive hello where are you going we are

134
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:44,640
going to die a hundred percent hopefully

135
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:47,700
just be perfect to implement a question

136
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:50,220
Vegas driving pet peeve by Becca let me

137
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:53,100
tell you okay people in California suck

138
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:57,000
at driving including me but everyone is

139
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:59,340
so okay so first of all biggest thing

140
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,690
nobody uses their turn signals you're

141
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,340
not a single person so you have

142
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:04,170
literally no idea what anybody's going

143
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:07,140
to move relocate themselves speed up

144
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:09,030
slow down or get off an accent so I've

145
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,470
already witnessed like eighty six car

146
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:12,690
crashes almost happened and like the

147
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:14,220
front of my eyes like several as much

148
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:15,960
I've always been apart from people not

149
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,700
putting on their signal it's like is it

150
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,860
really that hard to answer your question

151
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:24,620
no it's not watch ready watch that's

152
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:26,460
ready right click it okay look at

153
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:28,350
everybody who's behind me which is

154
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,250
nobody but if they were behind me

155
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:31,050
they're gonna know that I'm currently

156
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,370
making a right-hand turn so that's a

157
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:35,160
major issue that I have really been

158
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:37,650
finding difficult also like I'm a pretty

159
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,060
fast driver I'm very impatient I have

160
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:43,680
places to go things to see money to make

161
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:46,230
people to talk and if the speed limit is

162
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,970
35 I'm going at least 40 okay I did not

163
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:50,370
want to be going down a road that is 35

164
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:53,730
and I think at 32 miles per hour

165
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:57,180
why the speed limit is a suggestion not

166
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:59,730
11 and okay the next question is from

167
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:01,050
two obsessed with Conan and it says what

168
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:03,210
was the most difficult makeup look for

169
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:05,370
you to make or recreate I'm not really

170
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:09,210
sure off the top of my head probably

171
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:11,670
honestly the hardest talk about of so

172
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:13,320
much of the velocity videos but putting

173
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:14,970
like the white in the right areas and

174
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,950
trying to make it actually look like the

175
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:18,630
foundation was painted on top of the

176
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:20,340
white canvas for some reason was very

177
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:23,050
very challenging on the day of the shoot

178
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:26,580
but I love how Edna turning out

179
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:29,949
you know I think we need to do both yeah

180
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:31,840
yeah we already want to go to the

181
00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:33,909
McDonald's yep I think it's pretty close

182
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:38,319
to you so I'll just whip it over there

183
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:43,090
forever like someone's gonna crash into

204
00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:05,120

mean that's proving any tips for being

211
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:20,419
more comfortable as yourself tea

212
00:08:18,169 --> 00:08:22,130
honestly I like really really bad when

213
00:08:20,419 --> 00:08:24,139
it comes to advice on those type of

214
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:27,080
questions because of the fact that like

215
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:28,099
oh good hurry oh let's video is not

216
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:32,000
sponsored but I should be so the

217
00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:34,339
tunnel's please to be completely honest

218
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,479
I am really really bad at adviced

219
00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:37,849
questions when it comes to me being

220
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:40,450
myself and being more confident because

221
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:43,070
the fact that I have become Who I am

222
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:44,420
through dealing with bullying and

223
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:46,250
dealing with a lot of things working

224
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,720
against me my entire life I've always

225
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:49,940
just had a very very thick skin and have

226
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,829
been very very unapologetic and I think

227
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,930
for me you guys really know this but I'm

228
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:55,760
definitely a like self-proclaimed

229
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:57,350
workaholic doing the job that I do every

230
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,360
single day and working as much as I do

231
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:00,770
it does happen on the occasion but I

232
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,810
actually like taking time to get

233
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:05,120
offended over stop until I let that

234
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:06,589
stuff get to me for me personally I find

235
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,570
very very challenging because it's not

236
00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:10,040
giving literally just so busy I guess my

237
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:11,870
biggest piece of advice is like you are

238
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,680
you and you were born that way and

239
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:14,959
you're in literally the best in the

240
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,579
entire world and we all have our talents

241
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,020
and everybody has their flaws - its

242
00:09:16,579 --> 00:09:19,250
abroad to really focus on like what

243
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,750
makes you happy what makes you feel

244
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:22,550
confident so that you're not like

245
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,990
hopefully focusing on the negative

246
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,620
because it can turn into a really really

247
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:26,570
bad

248
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:27,950
and once you get stuck in that it's

249
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:29,750
really hard to come out of it that was

250
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:31,190
like a really crappy entire month and

251
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,640
surround yourself with good people and

252
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:32,840
so on

253
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,340
oh yeah that's a really good thing to

254
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,170
like sir I understand with really good

255
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:38,210
people who have similar work ethics and

256
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:39,860
morals like when I first moved to LA and

257
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:42,770
I became like a social-media influencer

258
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:44,180
I tried really hard to fit in with like

259
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:45,500
everybody and I was hanging out with

260
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:47,450
everybody and I was pointing to parties

261
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,980
it was a really really toxic mindset for

262
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:50,090
me to always want a fan and always go to

263
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,650
those house parties and be at those

264
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,270
events and stuff once I really stopped

265
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:55,100
trying and mostly because I was working

266
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:56,450
all the time and couldn't even have time

267
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,860
to try to begin with but I really

268
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:59,210
realized there was a small cork of a

269
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:01,310
friend's if I'm going to be there for me

270
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:02,870
no matter what and now I think of them

271
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:04,490
literally all the time and I've

272
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:06,260
literally had the same about spine group

273
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:07,640
since I first started to make it a three

274
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:09,440
years ago like they were the first ones

275
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,270
I ever had and we've stayed close ever

276
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,590
since so very very blessed to have them

277
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:19,040
in my life and you guys will be meeting

278
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:38,840
them very soon if you are be important

279
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:40,520
there okay so Leah asked who / how many

280
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:42,200
people are usually behind the camera

281
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,820
while you're filming your videos that's

282
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,170
a good question for those you guys who

283
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:47,180
do not know when I first started YouTube

284
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:48,380
it was only just me doing everything and

285
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,820
now through three years of working on

286
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:51,230
production I do have a full team that

287
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:53,270
works around me every single day which

288
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:54,800
is so incredibly amazing and I'm so

289
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:55,940
grateful for all that I never really

290
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,440
talked about that one before my channel

291
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:59,990
because I feel like there's a very very

292
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,670
weird mindset when it comes to youtubers

293
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:03,900
that like if you aren't doing everything

294
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:06,300
yourself that you're not like

295
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,770
anymore which is so weird I guess my

296
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,510
contact like speaks for itself hopefully

297
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:11,250
what I have something I usually have my

298
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:13,170
manager Jake in the room just because he

299
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:14,400
works at my house every single day so he

300
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:15,990
usually will just do his work upstairs

301
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,279
I'm filming my assistant Quinn it

302
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:18,810
usually that's where the camera as well

303
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,370
just make sure all my camera angles are

304
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:21,960
good and just have got me any products

305
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:24,029
they have it's already on the table and

306
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,350
I also have a writer named arrows who

307
00:11:24,029 --> 00:11:26,700
will also sit behind the camera with me

308
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:28,170
on the occasional video if it's really

309
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,790
cabinet to take your face video or every

310
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:30,690
review I always credit my team in all my

311
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,430
videos and I definitely had a few

312
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:34,140
questions about him and becoming like a

313
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:36,360
writer I know I call him my writer but I

314
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:38,250
guess he's more like a coordinator my

315
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,779
videos are definitely not scripted but

316
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:41,220
you guys know that I definitely have a

317
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:42,960
major issue when it comes to stuttering

318
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,070
and having to redo takes so haven't I

319
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,720
always said together before every single

320
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:47,580
video and kind of concept playing it all

321
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,480
out so I have notes and bullet points of

322
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,980
things that I want to say in the video

323
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,720
topics that I want to touch on or

324
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:54,330
sometimes even jokes that I want to make

325
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,560
if I it really depends on the video or

326
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:56,820
the day but there's usually around two

327
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,529
people in the room with me while I'm

328
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,930
filming okay next question comes from

329
00:11:58,529 --> 00:12:03,120
Mari and she asks would you ever come

330
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:04,320
out with sister swimwear I am really

331
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,000
really excited for a lot of the stuff

332
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,050
that is coming up soon on sisses apparel

333
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,279
so if you guys are kind of keeping up

334
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:09,690
with it for those you who do not know I

335
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:10,920
have a clothing line called sisters

336
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:13,200
apparel it is very fun very fresh very

337
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,700
cute what am i doing what what are we

338
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,230
doing I'm gonna turn around because this

339
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,700
Sun is going down but it's very very

340
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:21,450
bright so I want to have you on my left

341
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:22,980
hand side to get my gold oh okay sisters

342
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:24,660
apparel for me started off as a merch

343
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,920
line which was really fun of course I

344
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:28,080
did like my repeating sisters hoodies

345
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,339
and the sister sayings but my goal for

346
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,110
sisters abuela is not for it to be

347
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:32,940
merged but rather like an actual

348
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:35,160
clothing line so I really want to work

349
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,720
on it I have so many amazing plans for

350
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,700
really really dope pieces that are a lot

351
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,200
more than just like screen printing on a

352
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,400
regular merch ID like I have a lot of

353
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,750
custom stuff that's already in the works

354
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,270
the downtown clash that was done last

355
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,650
month

356
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:46,930
all custom pieces which I absolutely

357
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:48,490
love I'm gonna have a lot more custom

358
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:50,860
stuff coming very very soon including

359
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:52,660
some Eric up coming this summer so I'm

360
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:54,430
just really really excited I have a lot

361
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:56,170
of big fans for and I really genuinely

362
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:57,700
hope that it keeps going well the

363
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:59,590
support and sales recently have been

364
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,990
like through the roof like I'd never

365

so I can be blessed and meet you please

411
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:38,620
so I'm not really sure what I can and

412
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:39,910
can't say so I'm gonna be vade to avoid

413
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:41,500
getting in trouble because I don't like

414
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:44,830
getting in trouble but I will not say

415
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:47,440
that there are definitely lots of travel

416
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:49,960
plans coming out very very soon for me

417
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,580
which is really good and fun and I'm so

418
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:53,320
excited because I'm gonna be bringing a

419
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:54,850
lot of my friends with me as well I do

420
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,290
not like travelling because being away

421
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:58,150
from home and not being able to work

422
00:14:56,290 --> 00:15:01,090
every single day gives me a lot of

423
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:02,860
anxiety especially time zone changes but

424
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:05,260
having my close friends around me it

425
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:07,900
makes it so much better having you guys

426
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:09,670
around the wake wing as well make

427
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,900
everything a lot better so make sure you

428
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,800
have a post notifications on because

429
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,880
there definitely lots of announcements

430
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,880
coming very very soon

431
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:18,690
breezy cakes asks what do you want in a

432
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,690
boyfriend and why

433
00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:31,110
with Apollo sucks number one I want a

434
00:15:28,449 --> 00:15:34,089
boy who is strange

435
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:35,910
lot that for you that's easy it's you

436
00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:37,899
it's easier than you infect true

437
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:39,610
somebody who has not involved whatsoever

438
00:15:37,899 --> 00:15:42,550
with the makeup world and any way shape

439
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:44,439
or form because I need diversity and

440
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:45,970
variation in my life I would like

441
00:15:44,439 --> 00:15:47,589
someone who is taller than me it's like

442
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:48,759
a little spoon if you haven't met me

443
00:15:47,589 --> 00:15:51,129
person you know that I'm kind of tall

444
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:52,240
I'm 510 which is so annoying I wish I

445
00:15:51,129 --> 00:15:53,379
was a little bit shorter like five eight

446
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,629
you would be so cute for me I feel like

447
00:15:53,379 --> 00:15:57,490
so it's hard to find guys that are like

448
00:15:55,629 --> 00:15:59,379
really tall and then somebody was funny

449
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:02,350
definitely I need a boy who was really

450
00:15:59,379 --> 00:16:03,730
really funny because my life can be so

451
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:05,800
frustrating sometimes I definitely have

452
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:07,029
trust I'm super super easily so I need

453
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:16,180
someone who can make me laugh and make

454
00:16:07,029 --> 00:16:18,459
me smile even only for some days you're

455
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:20,970
tall just email me and I'll filter them

456
00:16:18,459 --> 00:16:22,779
to Texas yeah I'll filter them for him

457
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:24,279
okay on to the next question

458
00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:26,850
amber asks what you've ever considered

459
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:35,290
doing pop-up shops for sisters apparel

460
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:36,970
let me the most says she says Aaron asks

461
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:38,470
do you ever find it overwhelming trying

462
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:39,040
to create content that accommodates to

463
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:41,379
everybody

464
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:44,589
oh yeah that is probably literally like

465
00:16:41,379 --> 00:16:46,209
the only downside to my job is trying to

466
00:16:44,589 --> 00:16:47,980
produce content that everybody is going

467
00:16:46,209 --> 00:16:49,809
to enjoy like I talked about before I

468
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:51,129
definitely have a very very thick skin I

469
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:53,110
don't really get offended by many things

470
00:16:51,129 --> 00:16:54,819
but something that I do definitely get

471
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:57,850
hurt by a lot and I can admit this

472
00:16:54,819 --> 00:16:59,100
openly is when people don't like things

473
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,960
that I don't want to work into

474
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,250
really the big production videos or my

475
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,570
palate for examples like no I'm

476
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:05,370
obviously very very sensitive about

477
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:06,660
because I said this long to the poor but

478
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:08,610
like my pal was obviously my biggest

479
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:10,530
project in my entire career had

480
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:12,990
obviously my videos are all of equal

481
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:14,430
scale but I think of each individual

482
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:16,800
video as kind of like a mini production

483
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:18,150
and a mini project as well so a lot of

484
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,890
the work goes into a lot of the videos

485
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:21,300
whether it be in a production level or a

486
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:23,130
company that I'm working with or the

487
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,540
things that I'm actually doing for my

488
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:25,560
editing team is working really hard to

489
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,850
actually like make it really really

490
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,830
funny if I was having an off day so

491
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:30,540
everything one of the videos I like to

492
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:32,160
think of us like a mini project so it

493
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:33,600
definitely is really really hard to come

494
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,430
up with concepts that you know everybody

495
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,600
is going to enjoy it the reality that

496
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:38,340
I've had it got a bigger over time

497
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,580
everybody isn't going like every single

498
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,290
video

499
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:41,730
there's always gonna be people who don't

500
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:43,080
like it or who won't laugh as are things

501
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:44,700
for who aren't gonna understand turn

502
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,710
makeup techniques or products the lexer

503
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,240
and Lux and it's definitely been saying

504
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:50,280
that spark for me to kind of come to

505
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,810
terms with but I definitely chose I'm

506
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,490
getting better and better at it as I

507
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:55,890
keep going as a content creator and as I

508
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:58,170
get older as well so I definitely does

509
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:59,370
talk but at this point I'm just making

510
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:01,260
content that I'm really really proud of

511
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:02,700
and for the most part most of you guys

512
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,240
enjoy as well so I'm just gonna keep

513
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,490
doing that

514
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,290
whoever once said watch can watch it

515
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:09,870
hopefully stay with us for a while

516
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:11,880
okay so Masha asks what's something that

517
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:13,680
makes you want a sister snap every time

518
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,970
someone says it why don't you answer

519
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,680
that question what are something you see

520
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:19,230
happen a lot in my life that makes you a

521
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:20,970
no-entry so eating at a restaurant and

522
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:23,010
like James done a table and whatever

523
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:28,350
like when we went to Chili's great

524
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:30,180
kidding waitress okay so the waitress in

525
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:32,610
Arizona knew James or it was like

526
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:34,940
someone can go through you give me to

527
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:36,770
rent alone we're in Arizona for

528
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:38,570
fourth-of-july trip that might like

529
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:40,700
parents took us on and then we went to

530
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:41,780
Chili's one night and like that someone

531
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,430
in the restaurant basically knew who

532
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:45,260
James was so it was in the middle of

533
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:47,210
nowhere nowhere it was like we don't

534
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:48,790
even know where it was still and we were

535
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:51,440
in those chilies and then the girl

536
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:52,610
texted all her friends who texted their

537
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,750
friends detectives their friends who

538
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,860
texted their friends who talked to their

539
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,540
parents and their grandmas and their

540
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:59,240
grandpas in their sisters and those

541
00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:02,360

on at 10:00 p.m. at night so there was

545
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:10,730
we literally to start seeing people come

546
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:13,580
up to the windows and they're like hi at

547
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:14,630
the windows of Chili's and basically it

548
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:16,190
ended up with like a hundred people

549
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:18,170
showing up at this Chili's all asking

550
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:19,940
James for pictures well he literally

551
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:22,010
walked outside of Chili's and there were

552
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:23,720
a hundred people outside I was like

553
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:24,800
where did you all even come from like I

554
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,290
don't even know this many people lived

555
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,670
in they have dinner area the thing that

556
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:29,840
annoyed me kind of not the house had

557
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:31,010
people like they waited for you whatever

558
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,900
like okay that's nice

559
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:34,700
um but the people they were people just

560
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:36,020
come inside and ask for photos while you

561
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,130
were eating like just like come in and

562
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,990
be like hey do you think that'd be like

563
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:42,640
grab a photo really quick as I have my

564
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:42,640
20 dollar dinner for two chicken pasta

565
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:50,750
in it so that's probably what it is okay

566
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:54,740
Tori Walker asks are you thinking of

567
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:56,630
going on tour any time soon yes how's it

568
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:57,950
looking this is another quickie Bianca

569
00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:03,230
asks would you rather vacation on the

570
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:05,990
beach or in mountains also have a really

571
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:11,720
cool interruption

572
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:13,279
Oh magic if we got pulled over that will

573
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:16,130
be good for the video really would be we

574
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:17,750
should try to break the law uh-huh wait

575
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:19,549
would rather go vacation the beach or

576
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:21,380
the mountains cover the mountains I'm

577
00:20:19,549 --> 00:20:23,779
not really a beach person I hate the

578
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:25,940
sand I hate the water mm-hmm yeah like a

579
00:20:23,779 --> 00:20:27,860
good beach photo I like being in the

580
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:30,110
warm so it was like if it was like the

581
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:33,490
Hawaiian now and it's down but I really

582
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:37,279
don't like the beach I hate sand if

583
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:39,110
Sandra really gives me a gal and I don't

584
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:40,730
like being in cold water so okay so live

585
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:42,770
us what's your absolute favorite shade

586
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:44,149
from the palette and why that is such a

587
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:45,799
hard question because I literally love

588
00:20:44,149 --> 00:20:48,919
someone who close in there I would

589
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:51,559
probably have to say you're kidding just

590
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:53,210
because I've wanted a true Matt writer

591
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:54,320
for so long in my collection that I have

592
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:58,220
never been able to find one that I

593
00:20:54,320 --> 00:21:00,200
really really like and I also really

594
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:01,490
like the defense my mom's shade so has a

595
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,779
very special place in my heart and the

596
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:05,210
yellow sheet is really really bombed too

597
00:21:02,779 --> 00:21:08,179

00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:10,279
DN and plenty for the twins you forgot

599
00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:13,460

603
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:23,779

oh definitely stay on the lookout for

607
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:31,159
the house obviously I want to be fully

608
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:32,390
decorated frame post the video and it's

609
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:33,770
going actually pretty well somewhere I

610
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:36,289
will say I'm definitely making far

611
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:37,820
better progress timing wise on this

612
00:21:36,289 --> 00:21:39,620
house decoration and then like my

613
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:41,179
apartment but it's still not even close

614
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,690
to being done I have a few of videos

615
00:21:41,179 --> 00:21:43,850
coming soon

616
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:45,800

617
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:48,340
wink wink but I really do want to get

618
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:50,630
the house work on it as soon as possible

619
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:52,280
oh and should we give it a good

620
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:54,380
demonstration yeah but probably going to

621
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:55,760
like the middle I think right do you

622
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:58,370
think like over one more so you know

623
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:01,160
there are 8,000 cars right here on

624
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:07,340
course all he doesn't this is not good

625
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:16,340
or fresh for us let's try it okay that's

626
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:18,680
going how was it doing that my car is

627
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:35,120
literally moving and staying in the way

628
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:36,740
my favorite is when it lands did you see

629
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:40,760
that I saw it it's gonna stop for this

630
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:42,800
ready this is the craziest car in the

631
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,910
world this is so good for me to like

632
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,380
literally when you're a bad driver you

633
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:46,910
need this car like ten out of ten would

634
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:47,960
recommend okay I guess we can ask you

635
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:49,520
some questions while you're on autopilot

636
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,370
yeah you can maybe use some hand

637
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:56,240
gestures if needed

638
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:58,160
yeah Miriam asked is there anyone in

639
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,870
specific who has changed the way they

640
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,310
are towards you because of the fame and

641
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:01,610
money like I said earlier on in the

642
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:03,590
video

643
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:06,080
my Cora Cora friends have done the exact

644
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:07,970
same sets literally starting making up

645
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,340
for the first time so I feel like my

646
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:13,250
close friends know and I'm so come to

647
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:15,140
cable for it but so many people from my

648
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:16,130
hometown have tried to come back and be

649
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,299
like oh my god

650
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:18,890
I've said you're home and I'm like

651
00:23:17,299 --> 00:23:21,620
absolutely not you can sit on my face

652
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:22,910
every single time that I ever so many

653
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:24,289
other straight boys to that used to

654
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:26,960
bully me every single day in high school

655
00:23:24,289 --> 00:23:29,390
now sound chat me all the time usually

656
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,220
flirting with me so I guess it's not the

657
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:33,350
worst thing sending some Piketty wickety

658
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:35,390
booze oh this is a good one to finish

659
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:36,980
off the Q&A since I'm here I picked this

660
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:38,780
one because um it really talked to me

661
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:41,419
son Aria ask if you can honestly live

662
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:45,460
with one person for the rest room

663
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:48,200
I thought you'd answer that I decided to

664
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:52,640
literally will not move into the edit so

665
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:54,470
partially because really and we're

666
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,630
already together every single day I mean

667
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:58,850
really come to my house every single day

668
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:59,120
okay but okay so I'm like I have a

669
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:00,919
friend

670
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,150
I come over every single day because I

671
00:24:00,919 --> 00:24:04,820
like working out James says too because

672
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:06,500
I work from home as well but no but we

673
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:07,850
need her a little bit of separation too

674
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,860
because sometimes when people move and

675
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:11,270
together it gets bad can people please

676
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:13,159
agree with me on that like why don't we

677
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:14,870
ever we've never gone in a fight yeah

678
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:17,030
but there's potential to get in a fight

679
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:20,150
I mean if we live together and something

680
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:21,830
bothered us I am at James's house six

681
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:24,169
out of seven days a week from morning to

682
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:28,640
night time so like just let me sleep at

683
00:24:24,169 --> 00:24:31,159
my house no I'm looking for new houses

684
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,520
right now Andrew will be worried yeah we

685
00:24:31,159 --> 00:24:36,330
thought that we

686
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:40,890
at least triad yeah I will if I already

687
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:42,870

688
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:44,790
