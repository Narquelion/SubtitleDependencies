00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,399
welcome back to my youtube channel

7
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,480
before we jump into today's video i want

8
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:46,000
to play a really fun game of spot

9
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,000
the difference ready go

10
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,840
do you see it yet yeah yesterday i broke

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,680
a nail and if you were a fellow acrylic

12
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,199
nail wear like i am you would know that

13
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,800
this is already one of the worst

14
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,399
things to ever happen but what's even

15
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,760
worse about breaking a nail

16
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,199
is when you break a nail and you don't

17
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,480
know when it happened and you don't know

18
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,920
how it happened and you don't even have

19
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,560
the rest of it to glue it back

20
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,920
together i called my nail tech and this

21
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,600

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,119
i wanted to do something kind of fun and

24
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,960
also a little bit

25
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,560
uh scary i figured it was time to spice

26
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,920
it up try something new and especially

27
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,720
since i broke the nail yesterday and had

28
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,400
to have my nail tech

29
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,560
come back i'm going to be trying out

30
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,759
living with extremely long nails

31
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,200
for 24 hours so i've been seeing so many

32
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,759
really amazing talented artists like

33
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,280
cardi b

34
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,040
i know sweetie has really long nails in

35
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,720
our top end music video and

36
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,400
nail art and like growth is kind of like

37
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,119
a trend and like a community in itself

38
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,040
so i figured

39
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,079
i would dive in for one day and one day

40
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,880
only because i have a feeling this is

41
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,400
going to be very

42
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,159
very challenging and i'm going to see if

43
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,520
i can survive for 24 hours with

44
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,970

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,840
those before oh no

193
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:54,160

194
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,039
open the door but luckily the tesla

195
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,160

okay so when your nails like grow or

200
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,160
obviously in this situation just get

201
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,240
three inches longer your depth

202
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,199
perception gets really messed up because

203
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,879
you're used to

204
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,560
rubbing things reaching for things or

205
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,280
touching things at a specific distance

206
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,360
away from them

207
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,199

two hours on a normal day i could get

351
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,760
this done in probably 30 to 45 minutes

352
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,519

think that filming this video is gonna

377
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,240
be a piece of cake because you have

378
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,199
nails on it literally all the time

379
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,800
but then you try to start doing your

380
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,920
daily tasks such as tying your shoes and

381
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,120
writing back to business emails and you

382
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,079
literally can't do anything at all

383
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,120
you realize that your stomach is like

384
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,920
kind of grumbling and feels a little bit

385
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,880
weird and you realize that you really

386
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,320
have to go to the bathroom

387
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,440
so you go poop and then you realize that

388
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,639
you actually have to wipe your butt and

389
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,839
you have a full on panic attack because

390
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,959
you realize you can't do it

391
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,920
and you start crying because you're not

392
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:45,120
technically gonna be there for another

393
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:48,959
four hours to take them off

394
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:50,480
james what are you doing

395
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,880
why are you taking your makeup off i'm

396
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,839
over the stage i literally i'm free i'm

397
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,120
like actually starting to

398
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,160
get really anxious with just oh lots of

399
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,519
anger is happening

400
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,720
i have not been able to respond back to

401
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,240
any texts today i have not been able to

402
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,440
send any emails or taking my laptop

403
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,720
which is very much stressing me out

404
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,920
these are gorgeous they're fun to look

405
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,600
at and they were fun to

406
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,680
really tap out or do some nice asmr at

407
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,639
first but now i am very much over there

408
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,760

409
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,279

411
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,399

412
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:27,839

423
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,920
see

424
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,519
just left and we are back to our normal

425
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,040
length of nails on

426
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,519
just want to share some quick thoughts

427
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,720
my overall sentiments my feelings first

428
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,600
of all i just want to say a major shout

429
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,759
out to john for

430
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,519
being here for literally like six hours

431
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,079
in total today working on these nails i

432
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,160
don't know

433
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,360
what was really going on i honestly feel

434
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,040
like the best way to describe the

435
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,079
feeling that i was experiencing was like

436
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,920
claustrophobia

437
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,600
in a way if that makes literally any

438
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,639
sense i have so much respect for the

439
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,000
nail attacks that do

440
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,199
nails like that all the time the girls

441
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,639
that wear nose like that all the time

442
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,240
they are so beautiful they are such an

443
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,839
art form and if you are able to actually

444
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,320
function in your daily life with those

445
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,480
nails

446
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,560
more power to you because i obviously

447
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,000
could not but all that being said this

448
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,720
is quite the experience and i did have a

449
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,079
whole lot of fun

450
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,360
