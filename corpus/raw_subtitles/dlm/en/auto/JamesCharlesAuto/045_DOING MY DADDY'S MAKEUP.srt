1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,089
first his voiceover took the internet by

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:08,460
storm then he did my blame you've seen

3
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:12,929

00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,670
[Music]

8
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,140
notice very very very long time since

9
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,519
I've had tiny Victor on my youtube

10
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,320
channel as you heard him the very very

11
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:30,269
cheesy intro that we decided to get to

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,980
he did my voiceover and he did my glam

13
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:34,710
but I've been learning to claim a victor

14
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,840
for so long he's been declining forever

15
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:39,540
but we finally came to a good deal which

16
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,649
cannot be discussed on camera before we

17
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,969
really get into this video I want to say

18
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:43,469
a major thank you to one of my best

19
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:44,399
friends in the entire world Victor for

20
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:46,079
those of you guys who don't know if

21
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,160
Victor is not actually my father he is

22
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,780
my best friend in the entire world

23
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,489
husband but I call him daddy because

24
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,399
he's extremely hot and I fell in love

25
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:54,809
with him but we were just best friends

26
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:55,860
to clarify because we still get

27
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:57,090
questions all the time even though we've

28
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,710
disclosed in every single video so

29
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,469
Victor is not my father

30
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,579

31
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:04,140

141
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,840
dark so I'm gonna try to even everything

143
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,169
gonna bake underneath of Victor's beard

144
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:33,250
to get a more a defined line like I said

145
00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:35,080

to this chair oh my hands are tied

152
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:57,520

San Francisco's yeah that's like one of

163
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:22,000
like the first trips we get together

164
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:23,830
that was pretty cool

165
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,780
second temptress is no trip I didn't get

166
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:29,590

who did not use his plus-one wisely my

168
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:32,470
hurt memory of me and Victor together is

169
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:34,120
probably honestly like right now I know

170
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:35,080
that sounds so stupid but I've been

171
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,280
trying to get Victor to this video with

172
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,150
me for so long

173
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,740
I just think it's really cool that

174
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:40,330
Victor is like a straight married man

175
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:42,070
and is like letting me put makeup on his

176
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:43,900
face because he's like my best friend in

177
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:45,160
the entire world so that's cool and it

178
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,360
means a lot to me and I know this video

00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,070

amazing the morphe 35o eyeshadow palette

200
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,710
I'm gonna do a halo eye on Victor

201
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:40,090
because know like we should do something

202
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:41,620
fun why do you think of halo eye is

203
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:44,500
gonna consist of I don't know what is it

204
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:46,030
you know well a halo eye mr. Victor

205
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,710
basically we're gonna have the darker

206
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:48,400
shade on the outside yeah and then

207
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:50,680
there's gonna be like a pop of

208
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,180
brightness in the metal is it okay I'm

209
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,220
just gonna start off using my Sigma e35

210
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:56,940
a tape or blending brush and put this

211
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:59,110
dark e orange shade into the crease line

212
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:00,430
under season this shade is my transition

213
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:02,680
color I'm really not going to try to do

214
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:04,360
like too dark or too intense my halo ID

215
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,100
I want this to be like really light and

216
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,690
soft especially because if we stay here

217
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:12,280
for seven hours doing a lock on Victor

218
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:14,020
I'll probably end up stabbing me so X

219
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,880
under grab my morphe r39 brush and dip

220
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:17,510
into a medium of brown orange e shade

221
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:19,760
twos as like the trend

222
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:23,690
to start off deepening the halo effect

223
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:25,310
use Coe James wow that's rude daddy

224
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:26,630
right there I'm really focusing that

225
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:28,550
color on the outer and inner corners of

226
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:29,990
the eye and then budding up into the

227
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,370
creases the slightest bat but making

228
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:33,740
sure to leave the middle of the lid

229
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:34,820
nice and light in kind of empty next is

230
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,050
that same exact brush I'm going to dip

231
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:38,060
into a little bit darker of a brown

232
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:43,520
shade and then place that on the very

233
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:46,160
inner and outer corners all right

234
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:48,410
did you really and I'm gonna get Murphy

235
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,300
advant 1 4 9 I grab my darkest Brown and

236
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:54,910
really deep it up the internal corner as

237
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:57,680
that like last final darkening shade

238
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:58,910
they say right here yeah once you use

239
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,920
them a lot of times I have liver eyes

240
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:03,170
just how you memorize like locations in

241
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:09,320
the warehouse where the clothes go and

242
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:10,610
you're speaking my language when you get

243
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,020
like a fine dinner or annoyed you hear

244
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:14,090
really really mad and then you're really

245
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:16,100
 annoying about it like you can

246
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:17,750
take a tack look and I'm like you don't

247
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,820
listen to anything anybody else says you

248
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:23,930
being annoying that it that makes me

249
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:25,400
feel like that well great answer but it

250
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:28,040
is when you think you're always right

251
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:32,090
that's living you though no you both

252
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:36,080
that way no yes no thank you yeah the

253
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:38,090
difference the difference is you always

254
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,330
think you're right so do you well know

255
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:43,640
yes I keep quiet when I think I'm right

256
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:47,180
but there's some things that you miss

257
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:48,980
[ __ ] I don't think so squirrel I keep

258
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:51,140
quite a lot of times the things you say

259
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:53,240
that I couldn't have a pinion no but I

260
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:54,890
don't say it because it's not worth it

261
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:59,680
but when I feel like you're truly wrong

262
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:59,680
is when I I step in and I say something

263
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,880
sweet way

264
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:07,490
how does it feel know that I'm 18 and

265
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:11,210
I'm no longer your legal responsibility

266
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:12,800
as a father it's great freemen I get rid

267
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:14,300

268
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,770

then going back into my r39 person

274
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:30,860

275
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,790
are really really it diffused out for

276
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:33,230

286
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,700
