taking us right now being completely

50
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,649
unbiased and putting your egos aside

51
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:48,600

really yes we love a beauty guru I

145
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:41,430
really wanted to exaggerate the

146
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:45,090
natural-born facial features that you

147
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:46,440
had huh so I took your cheekbone and I

148
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:49,919
put some highlighter on it

149
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:51,960
so you let me get a little shave tape

150
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,729
concealer on your highlighter today what

151
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:58,040
is this concealer usually goes under

152
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:59,960
your eyes uh but when I was standing

153
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,310
okay so yeah makeup is definitely very

154
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,770
expensive so you're going for the budget

155
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:05,690
options maybe I was yeah one tonic for

156
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:07,970

157
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:09,350
