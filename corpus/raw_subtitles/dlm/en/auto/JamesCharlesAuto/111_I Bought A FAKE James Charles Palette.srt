58
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,079
without further ado let's dive into

59
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:44,520
today is a brand new video

60
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:46,079
so when I was talking about the PR box

61
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,180
is a few seconds ago you guys just heard

62
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,829
me say that it was a real James chance

63
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,409
for people at now why would that matter

64
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:54,090
you're wondering well because some very

65
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:55,979
shady people and companies out there

66
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,689
have decided that since the James

67
00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:00,420
Charles acts Murphy palette and sisters

68
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:02,009
sold out worldwide and is by far the

69
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,960
most sought after makeup line on this

70
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:06,810
holiday season and Ulta and morphic

71
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,489
can't keep it in stock that they would

72
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:10,099
try to keep it in stock and make their

73
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:13,219
own to try to cash in

74
00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:14,689
the sales absolutely not sense of how I

75
00:02:13,219 --> 00:02:16,249
first sold out a few weeks ago I've been

76
00:02:14,689 --> 00:02:18,349
getting tweets and screenshots literally

77
00:02:16,249 --> 00:02:19,700
every single day from you guys I've

78
00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:21,230
either fake website saying they're

79
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,969
selling the palette and running ads all

80
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:24,950
over Facebook on all of our social media

81
00:02:22,969 --> 00:02:26,420
of people listing their palette on eBay

82
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:28,639
for hundreds and hundreds of dollars

83
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:30,469
which is so ridiculous also people that

84
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:31,849
are literally emailing you sisters on

85
00:02:30,469 --> 00:02:33,290
YouTube comments saying that they have

86
00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:35,299
Amazon gift cards and different palettes

87
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:36,829
for you guys to win it is so ridiculous

88
00:02:35,299 --> 00:02:37,849
editors may be so incredibly furious

89
00:02:36,829 --> 00:02:38,959
that there are actually people out there

90
00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:41,209
that are trying to take advantage to you

91
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,950
guys please please please do not fall

92
00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:44,510
for anything the only places where you

93
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:46,250
guys can buy the palette or a more calm

94
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:47,959
and Ulta calm and I will always tell you

95
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,310
guys when there's a restock coming the

96
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:50,659
more of you legal team and my legal team

97
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,949
have been working together very very

98
00:02:50,659 --> 00:02:53,359
closely recently to make sure that this

99
00:02:51,949 --> 00:02:54,980
is taken care of and they've been

100
00:02:53,359 --> 00:02:56,719
sending a cease and desist after cease

101
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:57,709
and desist of all these online listings

102
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:59,480
makes your production has stopped

103
00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:01,639
immediately and all the listings are

104
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,230
taken down it is so disrespectful that

105
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:05,090
these people want to stop my name and

106
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:06,980
face and hard work on a god knows

107
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:08,510
whatever product this is to try to sell

108
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:10,310
it for a few extra dollars so for

109
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:12,109
today's video I thought if these guys

110
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:14,120
are trying to a sister scam you and get

111
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:16,280
you to order their pallets that is

112
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,479
exactly what I would do now I've done a

113
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,579
video like this on my channel a few

114
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:21,859
years ago when I tested out fake makeup

115
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:23,959
and to do this I had it over to Santee

116
00:03:21,859 --> 00:03:25,400
alley Santee alley is a very famous and

117
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:27,530
iconic Street located right here in

118
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,729
downtown Los Angeles who triggered where

119
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:30,829
they basically sell everything you

120
00:03:28,729 --> 00:03:33,349
possibly imagine well there be a trendy

121
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:36,169
off-white belt the newest Lima time by a

122
00:03:33,349 --> 00:03:38,329
pair of $10,000 YSL diamond heels by and

123
00:03:36,169 --> 00:03:39,979
by the way I think or whatever beauty

124
00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:41,209
collaboration had just launched you

125
00:03:39,979 --> 00:03:43,459
could definitely find it in the streets

126
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:45,620
of Santee alley well at least something

127
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:46,909
close to it I had no idea that was gonna

128
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,949
actually exist yet because obviously

129
00:03:46,909 --> 00:03:51,079
pellet just launched a few weeks ago so

130
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:53,599
I had it over to Santee alley to see if

131
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:55,639
anybody had a fake Jacob Charles X

132
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,109
Murphy palette I tried my hardest to

133
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:59,030
film on the DL because they're very very

134
00:03:57,109 --> 00:04:00,229
strict about their after searching every

135
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,790
Street and talking to every single

136
00:04:00,229 --> 00:04:04,759
makeup vendor in Santee alley for over

137
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:05,120
two hours literally on my way out there

138
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:07,099
was

139
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,290
last and that I happened to mess and I

140
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:11,360
was losing it all but I wanted to at

141
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:14,510
least give it a shot so I said hello and

142
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,699
he said hola and I said tiene la pelea

143
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:18,979
de chambre James Charles X Murphy and he

144
00:04:16,699 --> 00:04:22,669
said see you'll think of so low dose and

145
00:04:18,979 --> 00:04:25,430
I said cuánto cuesta and he said Fanta

146
00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:27,229
tolerates that I said Tommy Lowe and

147
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:29,540
finally after a very very long day and

148
00:04:27,229 --> 00:04:32,180
also an equally as long video intro we

149
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:35,900
are back home with this the James

150
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:37,220
Charles acts morphe palette for today's

151
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,320
video we're going to be testing out and

152
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:40,639
comparing these babies right here the

153
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,990
real version and the fake person I

154
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,000
literally have not even opened this up

155
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,680
yet I wanted to save my first impression

156
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,910
on camera but we're gonna be swatching

157
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,530
them looking at the colors of the

158
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:50,150
rotation and the shade names the actual

159
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:52,550
sizes of palette which already are

160
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:54,320
literally it not the same and I'm gonna

161
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:55,490
try to put them on my eyes as well

162
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,680
hopefully I don't get an eye infection

163
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:59,210
or get hurt we have no idea where these

164
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,889
palettes are being produced and their

165
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:02,479
venom Soleil reports and stories of the

166
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:05,990
most repulsive ingredients going into

167
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:07,699
fake makeup such as literal rot feces in

168
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:10,070

police say they have confiscated

173
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:22,760
counterfeit makeup that tested positive

bad purchases but also to see if a

182
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:40,820
knockoff can compare to literally the

183
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,860
best makeup palette on the marketplace

00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:51,500
video

187
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:53,520
[Music]

188
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:55,080
alright guys let's just jump right into

189
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,910
this I have been dying to open this up

190
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,520
all wording blog and see what the heck

191
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:01,680
is inside oh my god so first of all the

192
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,390
packaging it clearly not the same of my

193
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,740
head is like 800 percent bigger on this

194
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:09,090
and also this skin tone situation we

195
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,990
really don't love a sister's candle so

196
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:12,030
I'm gonna need them to fix that

197
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:13,020
immediately it's a darker packaging and

198
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:14,910
also as well

199
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:16,560
it's literally like an inch smaller and

200
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:18,600
to me I have a feeling that we might

201
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,580
open this up and it'll be a 35 color

202
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,050
palette as opposed to a 39 color palette

203
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,850
so I don't know what's gonna begin here

204
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:25,820
looking at the back of the boxes the

205
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:28,770
note and signatures are exactly the same

206
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:30,780
except there's a few typos in the fake

207
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:32,940
version for some reason the H and

208
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:34,440
Charles is capital and morphe brushes is

209
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:36,180
spelled wrong let's look at the

210
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,950
ingredients on the back of my palette

211
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,420
there's a huge detailed paragraph of all

212
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:40,890
the different shades the different

213
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:42,240
formulas at the different ingredients in

214
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:44,070
the pressed pigment or the regular

215
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:48,090
shadows on the back of this palette

216
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:52,230
there are not but the shade names on

217
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:55,800
this are safe word charm dominatrix

218
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:57,450
military fetish androgyny poison and

219
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,490
swallow now I don't know about you guys

220
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:00,990
but those names definitely are not in

221
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:02,550
the James Charles ex Murphy palette but

222
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:04,410
I'll tell you what palette they are in

223
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:06,300
the jeffree star cosmetics androgyny

224
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:07,920
palette I'm really not sure how people

225
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,450
still be headed to mix Jeffrey and I on

226
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,800
we look nothing alike and are both

227
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:12,510
incredibly hard-working and have our own

228
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,130
things going on but at this point I

229
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:15,840
think I need to open this up you guys

230
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:21,300
I've been waiting for way too long and I

231
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:24,420
just need to see what's inside oh I

232
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,890
think it still looks like my palette

233
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:30,390
here's the real one here is the fake one

234
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:36,420
I just need to open this up I don't know

235
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:37,860
why I'm so scared oh my god okay oh wow

236
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:40,680
well first all this plastic has

237
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:42,030
literally nothing on it so that's

238
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,310
looking at these two problems back to

239
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:45,150
each other a lot of these shapes are

240
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:46,650
completely wrong like literally if

241
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:48,720
there's fabulous chains left and right

242
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:52,530
those colors that are wrong but from

243
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:54,810
afar definitely my palate unleash your

244
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:56,490
inner honest more like unleash my inner

245
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:57,600
lawsuit before I jump in and start

246
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:01,740
playing I think I want to do a few

00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:30,410
social blade and social blade literally

253
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:38,370
not even the same formula okay we have a

254
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:41,130
playground and playground you and last I

255
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:42,979

257
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:48,560
look just looking at these two on the

258
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:57,420
finger you can already tell we have

259
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:58,650
escaped and escaped oh so sad okay I'm

260
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,960
gonna go ahead and take this off my arm

261
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:02,850
and so far so good my skin is not

262
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,800
reacting in any sort of way thank God

263
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:07,290
I'm gonna put on an eye primer so you

264
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,370
put these shadows to the true test all

265
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:09,750
right so I just went ahead at night zoom

266
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,890
do you guys add it to do these I look so

267
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,990
you guys can really see it the full

268
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:14,250
details of what's going on I have no

269
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:18,090
idea what is about to happen on my

270
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:19,560
eyelids but hopefully nothing that bad I

271
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,850
do have a holiday parties to go to after

272
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,230
filming this video so I think I

273
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:24,630
definitely wanna do like a kind of red a

274
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:26,370
smoky cranberry moment on the eyes but I

275
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,360
was gonna go ahead and play and see what

276
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:28,800
we can come up with I'm first

277
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,600
underground they're real you're kidding

278
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,400
on em four five six and put this shade

279
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,860
right into the crease using a tapping

280
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,480
motions for maximum pigmentation and

281
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,830
then with a clean em four five six gonna

282
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,750
dip into the same shade on the other

283
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:40,769
side do the same exact thing Pat this

284
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:44,790
right on

285
00:09:40,769 --> 00:09:46,470
corner and top it into the crease Wow

286
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:47,790
alright so I have no idea what's going

287
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:49,350
on in this outer corner there are

288
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:51,600
certain areas where the shadow just is

289
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:53,999
not grabbing - and there's also this

290
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,470
really really strange like line right

291
00:09:53,999 --> 00:09:57,749
here I'm gonna try to tap on some more

292
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:59,610
pigment see if that all fix it the

293
00:09:57,749 --> 00:10:01,139
pigmentation is also just not really

294
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:03,389
there I've had a layer that's up many

295
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:04,860
times it's not look good okay with an

296
00:10:03,389 --> 00:10:06,959
emperor 3/3 brush I'm gonna dip into the

297
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:08,639
shader code James and I'm gonna place

298
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,720
this right above thought you're kidding

299
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:11,189
and you set to buff out the edge a

300
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,389
little bit to be honest with you I don't

301
00:10:11,189 --> 00:10:14,069
think I've actually used these two

302
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:16,170
colors together yet but that's literally

303
00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:18,179
the perfect transition shade oh my gosh

304
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:20,429
grab me a cleanup 433 I'm gonna dip into

305
00:10:18,179 --> 00:10:22,230
the same shade in the knockoff palette

306
00:10:20,429 --> 00:10:24,029
and use this to blend out this other

307
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:25,199
edge oh my god I'm really having to

308
00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:26,970
blend this so hard to even get the

309
00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:30,299
shadows to show up what is this line

310
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:31,529
like dude okay maybe if I try to put

311
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:33,360
back the you're kidding overtop at

312
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:34,799
Alltech so just gonna pop this in there

313
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,119
okay that definitely fixed it a little

314
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:37,410
bit I definitely want to deep it up this

315
00:10:36,119 --> 00:10:39,420
crease so I'm gonna grab an avid four

316
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:42,119
five six and dip into a boutique the

317
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:43,589
dark matte cranberry red and layered

318
00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:45,600
this over top and put it in the outer

319
00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:46,619
area all this color is so pretty

320
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,910
and then blending it out with that same

321
00:10:46,619 --> 00:10:49,499
brush that we had at you're kidding on

322
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:51,149
so on this side I'm gonna go another M

323
00:10:49,499 --> 00:10:54,089
four or five six and dip into the same

324
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:55,889
shade in this side boutique but before I

325
00:10:54,089 --> 00:10:58,920
even put this on this is my boutique and

326
00:10:55,889 --> 00:11:00,420
this is this boutique so I am gonna have

327
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,619
two different eye looks it's very clear

328
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:03,389
we're playing a little bit of a game of

329
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:04,949
one of these things is not like the

330
00:11:03,389 --> 00:11:07,470
other doing the same thing packing the

331
00:11:04,949 --> 00:11:09,600
shade right into the crease just even

332
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:11,100
doing anything hello whatever I'm four

333
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,480
three three back into the fake you're

334
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,009
kidding I'm gonna see if that blends

335
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,389
anything out a little bit there's two

336
00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:17,189
different looks here I really know what

337
00:11:15,389 --> 00:11:18,509
to do I can't go to a party looking like

338
00:11:17,189 --> 00:11:19,949
this are you literally kidding me the

339
00:11:18,509 --> 00:11:22,170
pigmentation isn't bad and the fake

340
00:11:19,949 --> 00:11:23,639
palate but it's just not the same colors

341
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:25,529
I think is like the real issue here this

342
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:27,299
is clearly a lot more dark and smoky and

343
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:28,619
cranberry whereas we just layer it on

344
00:11:27,299 --> 00:11:30,509
three colors and it all looks like the

345
00:11:28,619 --> 00:11:32,100
same exact shade of bright orange

346
00:11:30,509 --> 00:11:34,019
next under grabbin em 506 and dip into

347
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,100
the shade and Benny and Maya palette

348
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:37,319
which is kind of like the dark

349
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:40,550
eggplant e color and pop this right in

350
00:11:37,319 --> 00:11:42,649
this outer V and really darken this up

351
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:44,360
literally love the shade gonna bring the

352
00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:47,330
X that's right into the crease as well

353
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:49,100
oh yes that it's so pretty oh well oh my

354
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:51,260
god another NY bow sex is dipping into

355
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:54,410
the shade Benny I can already tell that

356
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:56,540
this one is not nearly as dog here's my

357
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:58,820
opinion here is the fake one basing this

358
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:01,370
right in this outer V once again topping

359
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:04,790
the shade on there that's ad oh my gosh

360
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:06,019
okay let's add on a lot more what's so

361
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:07,970
weird is that the shadow is actually

362
00:12:06,019 --> 00:12:10,370
going on and blending nicely and some

363
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:11,180
spots but it's clinging and won't blend

364
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:13,010
it all in

365
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,720
others like I've never seen this happen

366
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:16,850
before what's going on shadow will not

367
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,350
stick right there at all my neck step is

368
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:19,790
gonna be to cut the crease so we're

369
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:21,500
gonna do that I'm gonna cut the crease

370
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:23,510
using a tab 2 to 4 brush and a little

371
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,740
bit of concealer alright so now that the

372
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:26,209
creases are all caught I want to go in

373
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,829
and I want to layer on some metallic

374
00:12:26,209 --> 00:12:29,690
shades on there for a nice pop of

375
00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:30,800
festive color I'm gonna have it one two

376
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:32,930
four brush and dip it to the shade

377
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,579
shucks which is the cranberry metallic

378
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:37,339
red and I'm gonna pack this shade right

379
00:12:34,579 --> 00:12:39,140
on the middle of the lid oh my god I'm

380
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:40,970
so pretty I don't know why I actually

381
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:42,649
haven't done a like cranberry red eye

382
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:45,260
look yet with the palette I literally

383
00:12:42,649 --> 00:12:47,180
have just not had time but this looks so

384
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:49,220
gorgeous gonna use it and blend it into

385
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:51,290
the dark cranberry shade over here as

386
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:53,870
well for a smooth transition clean brush

387
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:55,610
up in a grab Chuck once again from the

388
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:57,950
fake palette I don't gonna place this in

389
00:12:55,610 --> 00:13:00,050
the same exact spot on the fake side wow

390
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:01,430
that's underwhelming okay then I really

391
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:03,440
take my brush into here talking this

392
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:04,820
right onto the lid

393
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,770
okay I'm gonna use this to blend out

394
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,820
that outer edge as well and then finally

395
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:08,959
just to brighten everything up a little

396
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,880
bit in the inner corner I'm gonna grab

397
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,829
another M at 1/2 for this one is clean

398
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,779
and dip it to a mix of the shades

399
00:13:12,829 --> 00:13:16,790
literally and also a little bit of a

400
00:13:14,779 --> 00:13:19,760
sister gonna talk that little concoction

401
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:22,370
right in the inner corner and blending

402
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,320
it into shucks oh that is so pretty oh

403
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:27,649
my gosh so for the other eye at once

404
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,400
again doc I mean that 1 to 4 brush I'm

405
00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:30,500
gonna do litter

406
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:33,470
sister what got you here literally is a

407
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:34,730
matte shade in this palette so not

408
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:36,170
really sure how this is gonna work out

409
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,820
well you know we're gonna do it okay

410
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:39,320
since I do a party to go to after this

411
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:40,760
and I don't want to look disgusting I'm

412
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,620
just gonna grab a sister because at

413
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:44,180
least it's a metallic shade and I'm

414
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:45,980
gonna pop that in here here's what we

415
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:47,660
have for the real palette is so far

416
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:50,470
really beautiful and here's what we have

417
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:53,540
for the think palette is so far not

418
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:55,730
horrible but definitely not comparable

419
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:57,020
in any way shape or form to the original

420
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:58,310
start over the lower lash line just

421
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:00,080
grabbing you're kidding on an am a four

422
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:01,670
five six brush and tucking this right

423
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,730
under here and blending it into the

424
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:06,590
outer edge same thing on the other side

425
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:07,850
please one oh my god back to the other

426
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:09,350
eye dropping a little bit of boutique on

427
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:11,870
a tiny pencil brush and using this to

428
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:12,950
deepen up the lash line packing the

429
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:15,200
shade right on there

430
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:16,790
and same thing on the other eye once

431
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,540
again where is this color like it blends

432
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:19,400
on to nothing

433
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:21,020
so that's the eye look all complete I

434
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:23,270
guess I'm gonna add mascara and lashes

435
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:24,260
off-camera in just a second but I want

436
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:25,490
to go ahead and finish out the face

437
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:27,410
using a few other shades from the

438
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:29,060
palette like I normally do before I give

439
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:29,960
my final thoughts although you guys can

440
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,730
probably already guess what they are

441
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:33,230
like always gonna give my face a light

442
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:35,330
spritz of the more V prep and set

443
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:37,160
settings right to prep for highlighter

444
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:39,740
again we're gonna add a 501 brush and

445
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:41,570
dipping into a face in my palette a

446
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:43,430
little bit above the brow bone as always

447
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:46,460
gonna tuck a little bit of that right

448
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:48,230
below the brow as well clean em 501 and

449
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:50,420
dipping into the shade and face I'm

450
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:52,130
already a little bit scared because the

451
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:54,470
shame is a lot darker than the one in my

452
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:59,780
palette but let see how this works

453
00:14:54,470 --> 00:15:01,730
no no absol giving not only isn't nearly

454
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:04,820
as close as blinding to the other side

455
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:05,990
but it's also way too dark just like I

456
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,180
thought as you can see when I look

457
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:10,220
forward you can literally see dark

458
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:14,990
orange right there where as on the side

459
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:16,100
nothingjust kintama BAM at last so

460
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:17,480
finally not least you guys know my

461
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,550
all-time favorite trick with the palette

462
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,170
robbing a blush brush this is the e4 and

463
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:23,330
to begin to the shade and literally the

464
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:25,310
metallic bright pink that we have right

465
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:26,220
on that lid and using this to mix

466
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:28,290
together the

467
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:30,810
I am loved stones for a beautiful pop of

468
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:33,150
pink so pretty and then finally another

469
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:35,100
84 brush and to begin to you literally

470
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:43,560
must be laughing oh my little I don't

471
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:47,760
even want to do this so now you want to

472
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:49,110
be pigmented no no absolutely not

473
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,820
of all the times this palette had an

474
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:52,200
opportunity to be pigmented it chooses

475
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,670
right now look are you literally kidding

476
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,650
all right sisters I'm gonna go pop on

477
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:58,110
some lashes and the lip to finish off

478
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:59,190
this look and I'll be right back alright

479
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:00,960
you guys I just popped on some lashes

480
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:03,030
these are the Lily lashes in the style

481
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,500
so extra Miami has talked a little bit

482
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:06,390
of glitter liner in the crease just to

483
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,520
distract from the bad shopping going on

484
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:10,230
on this side and also pops out and Kylie

485
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:12,450
liquid lipstick in the shade or not pout

486
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:13,980
to finish up this cranberry smoky clam

487
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:16,950
all right you guys and I think this is

488
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:18,450
the final oh the think now nobody has

489
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:20,010
the same message on ever and in white

490
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:21,870
the real car literally does not even

491
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:23,730
have that I am just realizing this right

492
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:24,720
now as I was saying I think that is this

493
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:27,560
real person

494
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:30,300
fake makeup challenge all complete using

495
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:31,620
my pallets look at the two different

496
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,720
sides of my face there is definitely a

497
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:35,220
major difference in how the look turned

498
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,210
out I said in the beginning of the video

499
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:38,280
that I really wanted to eat deep

500
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:39,930
cranberry smoky glam but perfect for a

501
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,220
holiday party and I was definitely able

502
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:43,470
to achieve that the less that my face

503
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:45,180
using the real palette you're kidding

504
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:46,980
coach Apes and boutique blended so

505
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:48,360
beautifully in the crease and shook

506
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:50,100
literally and sister with a pop of

507
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,780
glitter liner overtop blended so

508
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,610
beautifully on the lid for a really

509
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:55,230
amazing transition now on the other side

510
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:57,810
of my face I will say that the shadows

511
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:59,190
were horrible they definitely had a some

512
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:00,900
sort of pigmentation to them but as you

513
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:02,670
can tell I definitely did not get a

514
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:04,530
cranberry smokey eye and this is way

515
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:05,970
more orange tone and the deep shades

516
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:07,260
just really did not get as deep as I

517
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:09,030
wanted them to be and they were

518
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,860
extremely hard to blend there is still a

519
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:12,060
major patchy area in this outside edge

520
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:13,800
and whenever I tried up on a metallic

521
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:15,510
sheen over in this outer corner the

522
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,770
shadow literally disappeared regard to

523
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:18,180
the actual swatches that you guys saw it

524
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:19,980
live in the beginning and these colors

525
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:21,180
definitely do swatch but nowhere near as

526
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:23,100
beautifully as the colors and the

527
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:25,240
original pilot do so many of these are

528
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:26,799
just super super talking at how

529
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:36,070
like no pigmentation to him it's

530
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:37,240
honestly just like mmm can't relate I

531
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:38,380
mean I feel like at this point the

532
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,450
winner of this competition goes without

533
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:42,039
saying it's pretty obvious I may have a

534
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:43,419
little bit of a personal bias here but I

535
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:45,340
am definitely going to declare my

536
00:17:43,419 --> 00:17:48,220
original palette the victor Santee alley

537
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:50,440
sweetie I am so so so sorry but it just

538
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:52,690
does not compare in any way shape or

539
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:54,490
form and normally I would say it's the

540
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:56,200
thought that counts but myself and the

541
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:59,350
morphe team put in over a year of work

542
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:02,169
time love and thought into this palette

543
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:03,760
and the thought is counting in sales

544
00:18:02,169 --> 00:18:05,590
like I said in the beginning of this

545
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,909
video you guys I am so incredibly

546
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:08,770
