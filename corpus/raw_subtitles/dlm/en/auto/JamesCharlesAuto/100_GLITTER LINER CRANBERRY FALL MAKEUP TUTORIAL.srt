it down just a little bit and doing more

00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,750
classic but still gorgeous glam look

which is perfect for the upcoming

25
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:07,040
holiday season I created this dark

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,350
cranberry smokey eye with double glitter

27
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,540
liner glow of course in this dark purple

28
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:13,400
lip I absolutely love how it turned out

29
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,270
as always all products and discount

30
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,070
codes will be listed in the description

31
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:17,900
below and if you want to see how I

32
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:20,360
created this look make sure you keep on

33
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:22,430
watching to start off this tutorial

34
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,810
today I'm gonna begin with my morphe 35o

35
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:26,690
palette and just wanted the light orange

36
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:28,250
shades on my morphe m4 4-1 brush this

37
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:30,080
brush is great for blending out creases

38
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:31,370
and that is exactly what I'm doing so

39
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,659
I'm just putting the shade right into

40
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:34,400
the crease using windshield wiper

41
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:36,170
motions and circular motions to really

42
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,970
blow this color out if you want

43
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:39,979
everything to be it nice and blended I'm

44
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:42,110
then going with the darker orange shade

45
00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:44,120
on my m4 3 3 brush and it defining the

46
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:45,409
creates just a little bit more same type

47
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,270
of motions there's gonna be a lot of

48
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:48,799
different colors going on to this I want

49
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:50,420
to make sure everything is seamlessly

50
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,100
blended together and then with that

51
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:54,049
excess color I'm just going back in and

52
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:57,290
I'm going to shade in the eyelid same

53
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:58,369
brush same exact color once we have

54
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:00,409
those colors placed on there I'm going

55
00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:02,000
back in to the m4 for 1 and the light

56
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:03,440
orange transition shade I'm gonna buff

57
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,430
all of those edges to really make sure

58
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:08,959
everything is nice and blended out to

59
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:11,150
begin my lower lash in I'm going into my

60
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,980
m4 33 and the dark orange shade from the

61
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:14,900
35o palette and I'm gonna begin to buff

62
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,860
it into the lash line I'm not gonna go

63
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,420
all the way into the inner corner

64
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:19,220
however because we are gonna be putting

65
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,510
a pop of highlighter there and I really

66
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,610
want to make sure my eyes look nice and

67
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:24,319
open

68
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:25,670
same thing from before I'm using my m4

69
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,959
for one in the light orange shade just

70
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:28,790
to buff over the edges to make sure

71
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,990
everything is super blended out we

72
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:31,580
really don't want any harsh edges with

73
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:33,200
this and it's really gonna come in handy

74
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:35,870
when we add the Purple's which is going

75
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,640
to be right now I'm going into the dark

76
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:39,500
purple shade from the 35b palette

77
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,360
friendly reminder you can use code James

00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,730
for 10% off all Murphy products

79
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,500
I'm just using my m4 33 and brushing the

80
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:48,830
shade all over the lid just to create a

81
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:50,510
nice cranberry color repeating that same

82
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:52,760
step again I'm going back into that dark

83
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:54,200
purple shade on the M of 433 and just

84
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,209
dusting that shade lightly onto the

85
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,680
lower lash line I'm once again not

86
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:59,510
focusing that on the inner corner but

87
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,800
rather the outer and kind of creating

88
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:04,390
that v-shape that we know and love

89
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,650
unlike all of my J Charles eye tutorials

90
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:08,540
to finish off the eye shadow portion of

91
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:10,220
this look I'm going in with my m56 to

92
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,900
brush and the red shade from the 35 P

93
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,790
palette and dusting this in the crease

94
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,260
this is really gonna help the purple and

95
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:18,110
the orange blend together and kind of

96
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:21,110
create this like blended sunset smokey

97
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:22,190
eye type of situation you get what I'm

98
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,930
saying you know we're just kind of move

99
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:26,660
right out of the liner I'm using the

100
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:29,480
morphe gel liner in Slate and Maya m25

101
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:31,610
0-0 brought to create this sharp and on

102
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,410
fleek weight I am drawing the swing

103
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:34,760
pretty thin because I am gonna be doing

104
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:36,380
a double liner and I'm gonna be using

105
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,989
glitter so I'm just kind of try to keep

106
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:41,570
this pretty like subtle so it's not like

107
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:43,400
over attacking my eye this voiceover is

108
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:44,810
seriously a mess I apologize it is very

109
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,329
very late at night I just returned for

110
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:48,769
my trip so give me a chance and I also

111
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:50,209
ordered a microphone as well so these

112
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:52,310
voiceovers are soon gonna be a lot

113
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:53,870
better quality yeah I heard you guys

114
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:55,850
talking about it and I promise I'm

115
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:56,269
working on it anyways I'm now taking my

116
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:57,980
M

117
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:59,180
213 brush and taking that dark purple

118
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,160
shade that I was using before and

119
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:03,170
buffing out that black liner that I put

120
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:05,030
in the waterline just to create a nice

121
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:08,900
even transition and make that bottom

122
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:09,859
waterline SuperDuper smoky and dark then

123
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,450
to make sure that it's nice and blended

124
00:04:09,859 --> 00:04:13,519
out and that I don't have a block I I'm

125
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:15,350
just going in once again with the m56 2

126
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,090
and the red shade from the 35b and just

127
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:20,030
buffing over that line SuperDuper

128
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:21,620
lightly for the double glitter liner

129
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:23,810
portion of this look I'm going with my

130
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:25,640
Mac mixing medium on my morphe gel liner

131
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:27,320
brush obviously not the same one that

132
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,180
had the black liner on it from before

133
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,550
and I'm just dipping it to my copper

134
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,360
alla glitter from violet Voss I figured

135
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:34,340
this glitter would match absolutely

136
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,350
perfectly with the cranberry and the red

137
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:38,840
and it did I really really love how this

138
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:40,880
looked I'm just super carefully laying

139
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,800
glitter right over top of the black

140
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,930
liner being pretty careful to avoid

141
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,240
fallout but to fix it up I'm going with

142
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:49,760
my NYC liquid liner obviously in black

143
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,740
this liner is super duper opaque so it

144
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:55,370
really helps to cover over any follow on

145
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:56,540
that black liner from the glitter after

146
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:58,639
putting on mascara I'm just quickly

147
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:00,110
popping on a pair of false lashes I

148
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,729
honestly do not remember where these are

149
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:03,530
from but if I can find the name I will

150
00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:04,610
leave it in the description below I've

151
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:06,440
been wearing these for a few weeks now

152
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:07,880
and I do not remember I lost the box but

153
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,479
they are pretty similar to how slashes

154
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,040
ikonics

155
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,810

156
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,280
