00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
hi sisters James Charles here and

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:05,370

00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,080
god you guys for today's video I have

4
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,730
actually really really excited and I

5
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,889
just wanted to write in because today's

6
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,000
video is literally one of the most

7
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:14,280
requested comments from you guys

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,049
probably ever in the history of this

9
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,670
channel and I think I know why -

10
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:19,050
obviously you guys know I'd love to play

11
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,760
with makeup and it's my hobby and now

12
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,189
thanks to all you scissors it is my job

13
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,050
and I get to do it every single day but

14
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:27,150
I probably never would have fell into my

15
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,609
love for makeup had it not stem from my

16
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,449
love for art a few years ago when I was

17
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:32,219
younger I would come home from school

18
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:34,050
every single day and spend hours and

19
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:36,210
hours of my time trying portrait with

20
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,320
charcoal or pencils sketching in my

21
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,670
school notebooks or on my homework

22
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,829
drawing different painting and

23
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,270
scrapbooking literally you name it and I

24
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:44,309
was definitely trying to be a creative

25
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,270
in some way shape or form the toilet of

26
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:46,530
my palette that it's not really so

27
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,730
obviously is unleash your inner artist

28
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,500
which I feel like has definitely

29
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,820
it and my makeup stylist as well at this

30
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,020
point you name it I pretty much painted

31
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,059
every single day on my face at this

32
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,250
point everything from skeletons and 3d

33
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:58,320
special effects for Halloween time Tori

34
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,539
what is't dripping down my skin - even

35
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,129
at the aurora borealis literally stocked

36
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:03,899
up right here on my forehead and that

37
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:05,460
brings me into today's brand new video

38
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,080
my love for art has definitely made a

39
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:08,970
very large impact on my life and

40
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:12,180
somebody also has an intense love for

41
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:14,580
art is Bob Ross if you know who Bob Ross

42
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:17,250
says he's an icon and a legend or EP

43
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,450
gone way too soon but he truly changed

44
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,009
the art industry because of the fact

45
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:21,810
that he would go on TV for like 30

46
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:23,100
minutes segments and create a beautiful

47
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:24,570
landscape painting but what was

48
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,640
different about it as they who's

49
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:29,009
actually taking the audience through the

50
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,020
painting step by step almost like a

51
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:32,610
regular tutorial if you really kind of

52
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,950
think about it Bob Ross was kind of like

53
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:37,259
the first-ever guru before being a guru

54
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,240
even really existed and he had an

55
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:41,280
immense love and talent for painting but

56
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,500
to most everyday people painting is very

57
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,240
very challenging and he brought his

58
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,310
knowledge and his skills on a public

59
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,170
platform which at the time was TV and

60
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,340
share that with the world and help

61
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:52,290
people at home learn how to be better

62
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,090
painters just like I kind of do with

63
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,950
makeup every single day so for today's

64
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,479

65
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,189

all the colors across the screen that

122
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,550
you need titanium white while they're

123
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:09,830
doing that let me show you what I get

124
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:12,410
done up here hello blue today I'm using

125
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:15,170
an 18 by 20 process with this it's pre

126
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:16,790
strict and double primed and then I've

127
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:19,459
just covered the entire canvas with a

128
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:22,070
very thin coat of liquid white okay so

129
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:24,830
possibly painting on a canvas I'm gonna

130
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:26,630
be painting on my forehead and equally

131
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:28,280
as large surface a few months ago off my

132
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:29,570
Instagram I did an aurora borealis like

133
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,310
where I basically painted like the

134
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:33,380
entire aurora borealis and like a winter

135
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,730
scene on my forehead and then I didn't I

136
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:36,830
look inspired by it and I really really

137
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:38,120
loved how it turned out so I think first

138
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:39,560
two days did it I want to do it the same

139
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,300
thing to kind of keep the painting up

140
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,550
here and maybe even do an eye look using

141
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:45,350
the pallet after the sock just like a

142
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,520
little bonus tutorial moment I have my

143
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:48,710
colors picked out right here on Biddy's

144
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:51,380
makeup rubber flash palette and my

145
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:53,480
canvas is already primed with foundation

146
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:54,680
and lots of powder and concealer tell

147
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,450
you what let's turn up day with a little

148
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,460
two-inch brush okay you think I need a

149
00:04:56,450 --> 00:05:01,930
two-inch brush should I be using like

150
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:01,930
paint brushes for this I didn't prepare

151
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:13,610
okay suppose it looks like it's like a

152
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,919
light blue so I'm gonna take that's not

153
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:17,090
gonna mix together some blues this could

154
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,490
use my hand as a palette because I don't

155
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:20,930
have a fancy bob ross actual pala that's

156
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:24,760
like a good phthalo blue right there

157
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:28,960
criss-cross strokes that easy and easy

158
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:28,960
all the way across the canvas

159
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,599
and work down by the way the paint is

160
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:36,020
continually mixing as a liquid white

161
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:38,909
that's already on the canvas and

162
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:41,219
automatically your sky will get lighter

163
00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:47,909
and lighter as you work down toward the

164
00:05:41,219 --> 00:05:49,830
horizon oh are you kidding me there let

165
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:55,589
the canvas work for you how the colors

166
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:57,539
in the paint he this is an entire sky in

167
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:59,339
literally one minute is this a prank I'm

168
00:05:57,539 --> 00:06:01,020
using my crisscross techniques and

169
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:02,969
really just Criss crossing that for a

170
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,499
real one I wish I had a two inch brush I

171
00:06:02,969 --> 00:06:05,789
feel like that really helped me out here

172
00:06:04,499 --> 00:06:08,219
gonna really get this into the hairline

173
00:06:05,789 --> 00:06:09,990
because we got to go all the height to

174
00:06:08,219 --> 00:06:12,029
the top of the canvas he said as you go

175
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:14,759
down they'll be less and less product I

176
00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:17,610
don't like how do I just crisscross

177
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:19,559
crisscross crisscross lots of wintertime

178
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:36,389
sky if I ever did to myself we're just

179
00:06:19,559 --> 00:06:38,069
gonna move on but I suggest more than

180
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:40,469
the outside unison if everything works

181
00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:42,449
just right it looked like a shrimpy of

182
00:06:40,469 --> 00:06:46,800
lights just freakin right across your

183
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:49,740

185
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:53,759
guess I'm gonna have some more of my

186
00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:55,409
blue color I'm gonna pull it in from the

187
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,669
side like he said to keep your brush

188
00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:58,379
straight but I'm working on a not

189
00:06:56,669 --> 00:07:00,209
exactly flat canvas here so this is a

190
00:06:58,379 --> 00:07:02,669
little boobs I just did what he said not

191
00:07:00,209 --> 00:07:05,189
to do okay I'm already not following the

192
00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:07,409
story I'll pull inwards sorry Bob

193
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:10,139
there's my eyebrow I think my water is

194
00:07:07,409 --> 00:07:11,430
up too high right now I want a dark in

195
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:13,409
the corners on this I'm gonna take a

196
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:15,870
little pressure depression glue is much

197
00:07:13,409 --> 00:07:17,129
much stronger than phthalo blue god it's

198
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:19,469
a beautiful blue

199
00:07:17,129 --> 00:07:21,959
in the corners I'm just gonna have a

200
00:07:19,469 --> 00:07:23,339
small amount of depression oh I love

201
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:25,199
okay great we finally get to add some

202
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:26,789
forehead contour this I have definitely

203
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,259
downpour I'm gonna grab a little bit of

204
00:07:26,789 --> 00:07:30,719
blue and maybe a little bit of black

205
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:32,279
even two to really deepen that up and

206
00:07:30,719 --> 00:07:33,839
make it look like my forehead is that

207
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:36,059
eight hundred miles long when the

208
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:38,129
painting is completely done these dark

209
00:07:36,059 --> 00:07:39,869
corners will help lead the eye toward

210
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:41,159
the center of the painting come up a

211
00:07:39,869 --> 00:07:44,099
little in the water - we don't want it

212
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:46,919
left out okay just blend that cover till

213
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:48,779
it's nice and smooth

214
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:51,149
I don't understand how he's doing it so

215
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:52,740
fast and so he's done like three paint

216
00:07:51,149 --> 00:07:59,369
ROK's and there's a there's the entire

217
00:07:52,740 --> 00:08:02,399
ocean like a what hello no it's not no

218
00:07:59,369 --> 00:08:04,110
it's not yeah is it yes is it really

219
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:05,550
people be like James but back heck you

220
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:09,389
just did an entire snowflake in one

221
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:11,189
second on your face this is true I think

222
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:12,929
if I'd had a campus like this one be as

223
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:14,219
difficult I feel like it I really set

224
00:08:12,929 --> 00:08:16,050
myself up for failure here doing this on

225
00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:18,179
my own forehead adding some dimension to

226
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:19,919
the ocean like Bobby said oh my god my

227
00:08:18,179 --> 00:08:22,349
hair why did I let you guys talk me into

228
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:24,709
that it's like are you serious oh my god

229
00:08:22,349 --> 00:08:27,659
I'm gonna rip all my hair out this looks

230
00:08:24,709 --> 00:08:29,729
he has it literally um like I can see

231
00:08:27,659 --> 00:08:32,099
that the sky in the ocean on his already

232
00:08:29,729 --> 00:08:33,659
and the mine like what is this I think

233
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:35,519
we should just keep going let's you know

234
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:37,439
let me be positive everything why

235
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,389
Stern's all gonna be on so this is where

236
00:08:37,439 --> 00:08:46,380
I really had a good time it's cleaning

237
00:08:39,389 --> 00:08:48,449
this little brush shake it off really is

238
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,769
the fun part this whole technique I'm

239
00:08:48,449 --> 00:08:53,220
just gonna clean my brush you think I'm

240
00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:55,920
makeup wipe but I do love beating the

241
00:08:53,220 --> 00:09:02,509
devil out of certain things today let's

242
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:04,589
take crimson a little bit of black I

243
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:06,899
want to make up a little mountain in

244
00:09:04,589 --> 00:09:08,490
here I want to make a a dark we'll have

245
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:10,829
endure like in color that's most

246
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:12,959
important how you load the knife take

247
00:09:10,829 --> 00:09:14,610
cut across the paint and get a little

248
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,279
rule that lives right over the edge of

249
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:20,010
the knife okay let's go up in here right

250
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:21,330
here just decide where you think

251
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:24,930
little mountain who lives in your world

252
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:27,810
and drop dead painting is a very

253
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:30,000
individual effect we all see nature

254
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:31,350
through different eyes and that's the

255
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,090
way you should paint it all we're

256
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:34,500
looking for is the nice top edge we

257
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:36,570
could care less what's happening down

258
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,280
below our brush is good and dry a couple

259
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:40,710
liquid whites on the canvas you can

260
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:43,650
literally move color if you were working

261
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:45,630
on a drag canvas right now you'd be an

262
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:47,880
agony city that's a mountain you just be

263
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:49,740
the mountain and literally 30 seconds I

264
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,150
can't put like a knife on my face so I

265
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:53,580
guess I'm just gonna use like a flat

266
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:55,500
square brush which is like I mean sort

267
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:57,210
of as close I'm gonna get it right like

268
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,700
I don't know what else I would use well

269
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:01,290
no I think my water my oceans too tall I

270
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,760
don't have room to move out in anywhere

271
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:04,530
well now I have a blue forehead so what

272
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:07,350
am I gonna do now okay he literally just

273
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:09,000
like took the brush and like like what

274
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:10,800
honey he just like a little scrape down

275
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,690
there are you kidding me go back to the

276
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,970
solid dark color and come right up in

277
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:16,260
here that's Oh No hold on sweetie I'm

278
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:17,490
gonna need your paws oh my god here we

279
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:20,430
go another mountain okay so this one he

280
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:23,100
said he wanted to be more crimson than

281
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:25,880
blue so I'm gonna take some red and mix

282
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,880
it together here

283
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:02,950
always remember if you can see the

284
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:04,930
entire Mountain it's always more

285
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:05,590
distinct on the top but it is on the

286
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:08,920
bottom

287
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:12,180
okay Gus had missed and now we have

288
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:15,550
wonderful solution lays around a lot

289
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:16,750
across getting political okay so we okay

290
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:18,040
so when it comes like the bottom of

291
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:21,280
these rods he living stinking living

292
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:27,340
blends it away okay I need to pause it's

293
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:29,380
not good for this video he takes a dry

294
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:32,290
brush after that and just like goes in

295
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:34,690
and just like but lends it away how I

296
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:36,940
don't really know but we're gonna we

297
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:38,890
include me to figure it out yeah okay

298
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:41,140
this is not that bad like it's no Bob

299
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:45,100
Roth is for sure but it's not bad it's

300
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:45,790
fun to take and reflect a mountain right

301
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,500
into the water

302
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:51,580
Oh God now we're just looking for a

303
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:53,440
basic little recollection here exact we

304
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:55,990
first start is easier to take the canvas

305
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,450
off your easel and turn it upside down I

306
00:11:55,990 --> 00:12:04,210
just basically repaint them just like we

307
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:05,380
did Howard's also draw the same mountain

308
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:05,920
again look I don't even know what I did

309
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,840
the first time

310
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,250
are you kidding me I'm so focused right

311
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,570
now it's not even funny I want to make

312
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:12,430
this like actually good like I don't I

313
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:16,360
don't I can't flop okay that's not that

314
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:17,590
bad oh my god you're kidding yeah now

315
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,240
we're gonna blend it out just like Bob

316
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:22,290
sad blend it upward so it's like a

317
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,290
little reflection in the water

318
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:33,620
[Music]

319
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:45,850
as possible

320
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:48,190
we'll have thick and firm response the

321
00:12:45,850 --> 00:13:18,820
walls to go take a little white flag

322
00:12:48,190 --> 00:13:21,840
little you know oh my god you had this

323
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,840
has got to be Jose

324
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:33,940
oh my god Hey look first her is applying

325
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,560
too much pressure like he literally just

326
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,790
like ran the paintbrush over the area

327
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,200
with like with a little bit of white and

328
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:39,430
they're all sons of mountain range I

329
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,510
think this is so sick though because you

330
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:41,680
guys know that I always loved art but

331
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:43,570
what I was really really good at was

332
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,370
drawing portraits with like pencil and

333
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:46,810
charcoal I still liked painting but I

334
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:48,580
really wasn't that great at it

335
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:50,230
so like learning these techniques is and

336
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:51,880
same because I never in a million years

337
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:53,350
would have tried this stuff but it's

338
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,390
like not as hard as I would have thought

339
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:56,800
making some gray on the back of my hand

340
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:59,620
I don't really know how to do this

341
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,420
exactly I mean not horrible honestly it

342
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:03,460
could be a lot better but like could be

343
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:04,360
a lot worse gonna touch up some areas

344
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,980
where I'm like having a little bit of

345
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,120
trouble here so when I do my aurora

346
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:09,310
borealis like a few months ago I

347
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,050
actually did do winter mountains in the

348
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:12,160
photo and they were white as opposed to

349
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,570
like a shadow and that one like we're

350
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,800
doing right now if you zoom it on the

351
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:16,900
photo there's like a lot of dimension in

352
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,310
detail in the mountains and I will say

353
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,600
I'm pretty proud of how they ended up

354
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:21,040
looking if like it did look pretty real

355
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,110
that's because I spent literally an hour

356
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,710
going in and drawing tiny little black

357
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:27,420
lines and dots to symbolize like

358
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:28,740
and shadows and the mountains what all I

359
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:30,480
had to do was scrape it on there with a

360
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:32,670
knife we'll just take it's a mountain

361
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,280
killer same amount covering sort of a

362
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:37,020
lavender would tap a little bit right

363
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:39,390
into that two-inch brush don't be afraid

364
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:40,910
of this brush because it's large it'll

365
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:45,420
do wonderful things

366
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:47,010
let's to say I don't don't be afraid to

367
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:49,650
this brush because it's large it'll do

368
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:52,050
wonderful things that it's my model in

369
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:55,140
life just not for brushes let's have

370
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:58,440
some fun some blue and some black put

371
00:14:55,140 --> 00:15:01,290
some brown in it add some green what

372
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:03,990
yeah basically all your dark colors

373
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:05,970
there's one number six fan brush little

374
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:07,200
fan brushes are you kidding just put a

375
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:08,460
little bit of color right on the brush

376
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,340
it's all there is to it

377
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:12,420
gross fan versus living - nothing

378
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:22,100
there's literally no plant fan brushes

379
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:24,780
they're the dumbest brush little trees

380
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:29,640
little closer to this but living very

381
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:31,530
far away suddenly I need a fan brush to

382
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:33,090
make this little grass he had like a

383
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:36,300
Gotha we pull this up he had like a

384
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:37,800
green and like some dark mess okay we're

385
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,150
gonna put that like over here

386
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:54,200
I'm gonna use like a little liner brush

387
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:54,200
maybe I got some more dimension oh

388
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:01,740
that's the shoreline this is crazy like

389
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:03,510
oh my god are you serious so a little

390
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:05,190
bit of white and I notice how he when he

391
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:07,980
was like playing around with the colors

392
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:09,600
he like kind of like let them be messy

393
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:11,460
so almost when he puts them on they're

394
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,900
like it kept some of that dimension

395
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,980
maybe that's the technique that I'm

396
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,210
messing up a little bit is that like I'm

397
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:17,460
trying too hard to make it look perfect

398
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:18,330
that doesn't exactly work I think it's

399
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:22,230
totally a lot more than just that

400
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:23,940
technique that I'm messing up just

401
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:25,260
cut in a little water line if you put a

402
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,760
little too much liquid white on there

403
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:29,670
and you think it's a little too strong

404
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:32,970
just rub it it will just be absorbed

405
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:34,800
into the color it'll go away he's such a

406
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:36,300
good teacher that's what I will say too

407
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,310
is like everything that he's doing he

408
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:40,680
makes it look so easy

409
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:42,000
but you actually get to watch him and do

410
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,440
the entire thing I suppose that I'm just

411
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,360
like cutting to the finished product

412
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,130
he's a little bit away to sketch in a

413
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,150
water line I mean honestly like not

414
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:50,910
horrible

415
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:52,110
like not great but still not horrible we

416
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:54,920
need to figure out hope we're gonna put

417
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:58,140
in here so let's take some pression blue

418
00:16:54,920 --> 00:17:00,900
set green crimson brown here's old

419
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:02,790
two-inch brush we'll take him let's just

420
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:06,329
block in some areas we're gonna have a

421
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:07,680
big tree that lives right here this is

422
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:09,329
sort of your bravery test after you

423
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,890
worked so hard to put in all those

424
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:13,770
gorgeous things when you come up here

425
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:16,380
some crazy fuzzy haired guy says we did

426
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:18,060
a big tree right over the top of air and

427
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:20,760
I already listed a tree once again he

428
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:22,589
just painted it an entire tree in 30

429
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:24,630
seconds so I have my little two-inch

430
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:28,440
brush I'm gonna put that over here cuz

431
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:30,660
this is where the tree should go oh so

432
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:32,730
now we've had a wall because um that's

433
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:34,380
not a tree and anyways like not even

434
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:36,540
close to like everything else is like

435
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:38,430
okay this is like Bob like that's a blob

436
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:52,890
of paint I don't know how he did that I

437
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:57,180
doesn't take advantage of what happens

438
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:57,930
we call those accidents and they can be

439
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:02,910
your best friend

440
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:06,960
oh my literal God he isn't because right

441
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:09,110
going down there those are trees and

442
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:13,530
those are trees in the reflection

443
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:15,330
you're kidding huh oh my god this is too

444
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:16,560
challenging for me I also set myself up

445
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:18,690
for failure I doing this on my own face

446
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:20,430
but let's put some freakin trees in here

447
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:22,470
what are you kidding

448
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:24,030
how does he do that I mean it could be

449
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:25,530
worse maybe if I use like a little bit

450
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:27,120
like more of like a fluffy brush as

451
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:28,130
opposed like a pencil brush like this

452
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,130
will work cause it

453
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:32,810
like all that texture no that did not do

454
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:34,370
anything maybe something like this it's

455
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:36,920
like a literally like a rough that

456
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:38,990
actually literally hurts yes this is a

457
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:49,640
horse right underneath that we need a

458
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:51,290
reflection is the treatments right here

459
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:53,600
we'll put some highlight I'm so sure

460
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:59,150
this one lives a little closer to us so

461
00:18:53,600 --> 00:19:05,390
we can make out a little more oh my god

462
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:09,770
that's an entire poetry oh my god no

463
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:12,440
okay so no oh he put a tree like right

464
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:13,760
here-ish I'm just like stifling this on

465
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,330
for a real one I'm hoping that it looks

466
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,190
good

467
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:17,930
that looks so dumb are you kidding me

468
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:19,070
how did he do that no I'm annoyed

469
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:20,960
because they actually wanted this to

470
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:23,060
look good and it's not looking a good or

471
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:27,380
Frosch there's your freaking pine trees

472
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:31,000
in the forefront Bob what the oh I don't

473
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:31,000
understand how he does this so quickly

474
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:43,160
that'll snatch it right up are you

475
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:45,410
kidding Bob Ross is not a superstar

476
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,940
beauty guru Wow Bob Lois is really

477
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:49,160
coming from prayin today mixing together

478
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:55,610
green and yellow on the back of the hand

479
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:57,890
the little palette here I really thought

480
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:59,390
I was gonna be okay at this I am not

481
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:02,690
realizing that these trees are forming a

482
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:04,820
separate island to overlap the water and

483
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:06,980
I did not get that memo before oh no

484
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:08,360
like Bob said you know we get to choose

485
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:10,430
where we want to put our things in our

486
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:12,050
world so these trees are going in front

487
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:13,700
they're loving their grass area right

488
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:14,600
here taking this into my own hands for a

489
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,250
second you know we're just putting the

490
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,720
grass right here we're dragging that

491
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:20,030
brush upwards to create the appearance

492
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:25,640
of grass just like Bob said Bob sweetie

493
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:27,800
I am so sorry it just looks like he's

494
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:29,510
like painting maybe Bob Ross has Mother

495
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,900
Nature conspiracy theory he just paints

496
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:31,900
it in there

497
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:39,720
well now I feel stupid I messed us all

498
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:49,530
treat lives okay back to the victory

499
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:52,200
craze that's the beauty of pain yes you

500
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:55,380
really don't have to know exactly where

501
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:57,450
everything's at we Thomas works trust me

502
00:20:55,380 --> 00:21:00,090
I know okay so I'm gonna go back to this

503
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:02,130
and I'm gonna hide away my mistakes by

504
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:05,130
using lots of dark colors and making

505
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:07,440
this tree a little bit more tree like so

506
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:09,360
let's make this a tree and it goes all

507
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,980
the way down just like Bob said that is

508
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,980
the worst of all time are you kidding me

509
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:18,720
[Music]

510
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:26,479
[Music]

511
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:38,550
you can put this right on here oh my god

512
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:39,660
are you love me just okay so I think

513
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:41,070
before we move on to the next step I

514
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:42,780
want to pause for a second actually move

515
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:45,090
away from the tutorial and fix a mistake

516
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:47,070
that I made early on which was putting

517
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:49,170
the lighter mountain-like on the edge as

518
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:50,820
opposed to in the middle so we have this

519
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:53,580
like kind of entire area on my forehead

520
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:55,830
a completely blank so I think I want to

521
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:59,010
try to do another big tree over here

522
00:21:55,830 --> 00:22:00,420
since I butchered this one so badly just

523
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:02,370
to one fix it a little bit and make it a

524
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:03,930
more composed to painting but also to it

525
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:05,730
to get a little more practice then so if

526
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:07,440
I put it like over here just like

527
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:09,630
sketching in I was like little thing

528
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,460
with my number two brush that looks

529
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:13,350
literally already a million times better

530
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:15,210
than the first one okay love that love

531
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:16,860
me making progress next we added a

532
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:19,110
little bit of green landscape so I'm

533
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:21,030
gonna do that as well over here just

534
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:22,830
sketching it in not really caring

535
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:24,540
because it's our world and we get to

536
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:25,710
place the greenery wherever we want it

537
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:27,810
to be so I'm just gonna put it right

538
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:29,460
here kind of right underneath my eyebrow

539
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:31,530
sucks gonna take a little bit of that

540
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:33,300
landscape and we're just gonna blend it

541
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:36,120
downwards oh there's some on this side

542
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:37,830
too so taking some more yellow and green

543
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:40,830
for some dimension gonna stipple it

544
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:41,920
right on here ah slightly too yellow no

545
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:43,240
worries though

546
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,460
it's gonna take our 2 inch brush and

547
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:47,440
just dump right over top of that just

548
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:49,810
blend it away we have the liquid white

549
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,970
underneath so no worries I forgot to add

550
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:53,770
in my tree trunk with a little bit of

551
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:56,320
brown and a little bit of titanium white

552
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:56,920
before adding in the details let's do

553
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:01,780
that now

554
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:03,730
can't blame us let my mind know maybe a

555
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:06,130
little bit of white perhaps it's a birch

556
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:07,840
tree we get to choose it's our world

557
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:09,730
never gonna go back in and add some more

558
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,350
dimension discovering our little bit of

559
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:13,540
green and a little bit of yellow mixing

560
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:14,410
it together on the palate just stifling

561
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:16,510
it right on there

562
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:18,310
oh my god that's a tree I feel ready to

563
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:19,930
add some more like dimension into my

564
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:21,970
grass I feel like my grass is looking

565
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:23,830
slightly flat so I'm gonna grab some

566
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:25,180
yellow and some green just like the

567
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:26,830
trees and just go in and just like

568
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:28,540
slightly sniffle just like he said and

569
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:30,730
then lift it right up words just right

570
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:32,140
now that creates the illusion of grass

571
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:34,390
and that in the foreground of the

572
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:36,130
painting I'm acting like I know exactly

573
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:38,650
what I know but really they have no idea

574
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:40,510
great part of the tutorial I want to

575
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:43,870
show you an easy way of making a

576
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:45,820
fantastic effect one side only I'll put

577
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:48,370
in the light color so you get dark light

578
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:51,790
now watch it watch a little stone biz

579
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:54,790
right there and wherever you want these

580
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:58,920
are you just drop them in several little

581
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:58,920
stones put some little grass seed things

582
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:08,440
it brings it all together he makes it

583
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:10,000
look so easy oh my gosh it would put

584
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:12,160
just the indication of a little water

585
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,340
line here they're sort of bring it all

586
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,340
together

587
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:18,009
[Music]

588
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:23,809
I really hope you've enjoyed this I hope

589
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:25,850

from all of us here I'd like to wish you

591
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:34,880
happy painting

592
00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:35,299
god bless my friend oh I guess we're

593
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,650
done

594
00:24:35,299 --> 00:24:37,669
it was literally almost as if he was

595
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:39,380
like throwing the paint on the canvas

596
00:24:37,669 --> 00:24:40,789
and it was just like working what's the

597
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:42,590
same that I've talked about my videos a

598
00:24:40,789 --> 00:24:43,730
lot of times that like you shouldn't do

599
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:45,710
as an artist because it doesn't work

600
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:48,980
that way but like Bob Ross like is

601
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:52,460
magical and it is working totally for me

602
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:54,080
it isn't so much just happened I mean we

603
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:55,880
literally painted an entire mountain end

604
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,679
of like forest landscape on my freaking

605
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,880
forehead my hands palette as you can

606
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:01,130
tell it's covered with every color you

607
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,720
could possibly imagine and I really hope

608
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:04,039
you help us look turned out just as fun

609
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,020
I thought I'd clean up this palette

610
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:08,630
super quickly and take out my palette

611
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:10,760
and do a super quick and easy Bob Ross

612
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:12,890
inspired I look just to kind of pull the

613
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:14,929
whole face together let's get started

614
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:16,490
again I'm gonna prime my eyelids as

615
00:25:14,929 --> 00:25:17,510
always using my morphe tab but one seven

616
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:18,049
three brush on my Mac painterly

617
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,490
paint-pot

618
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:21,470
grabby gonna add about four five six I'm

619
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:23,870
gonna dip into the shade of the dark

620
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:25,669
matte green and pack this in an outer V

621
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:27,230
shape and then with any excess I'm just

622
00:25:25,669 --> 00:25:29,299
bringing that shade right into the

623
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:31,070
crease and then having a 10.33 are gonna

624
00:25:29,299 --> 00:25:32,870
dip into a social blade in the bottom

625
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:34,580
left hand corner and use that to buff

626
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:35,570
out the edges first pocket light color

627
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:37,100
on there and then just using light

628
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:39,020
circular motions to diffuse not that

629
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:41,360
edge I pack a little bit of Daddy into

630
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:43,220
that outer corner mixing together a tiny

631
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,860
little bit of dotty and a little bit of

632
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:47,030
tea on a tan 506 as well I'm just gonna

633
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:49,039
use this to deepen off the outer V

634
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:51,260
grabbing a little bit of concealer and

635
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:53,809
an m12 four brush I'm going to quickly

636
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:54,980
cut the crease now on another I want to

637
00:25:53,809 --> 00:25:56,990
for brush I'm gonna dip into the shader

638
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:58,400
wah I'm gonna give it a quick spritz of

639
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:59,720
some setting spray and I'm gonna pop

640
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,100
this shade right in the middle of the

641
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,480
crease and then just like always with

642
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,799
that either access shadow that's left on

643
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,049
the brush I'm just going to blend in

644
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:07,760
that edge so there's no harsh line on

645
00:26:06,049 --> 00:26:09,350
that concrete with that same brush I'm

646
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,120
gonna grab a little bit of ring light

647
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:12,590
and give that a sprint up some setting

648
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,600
spray as well and we're gonna pop that

649
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:17,330
in the inner corner and overlap it right

650
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:19,880
over top that guac to make kind of like

651
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:21,940
an ombre metallic shade dipping into a

652
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:23,470
tiny bit of it be and I'm gonna pal

653
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:24,909
in the inner corner gotta highlight my

654
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:26,950
inner corners with the yellow just like

655
00:26:24,909 --> 00:26:28,269
Bob Ross dead with his trees for the

656
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:30,009
lower lofts I'm gonna grab a little bit

657
00:26:28,269 --> 00:26:31,450
of a cola and pack this right up against

658
00:26:30,009 --> 00:26:32,710
the lash line oh good it's happen to

659
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:34,600
both the playground and a little bit of

660
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:36,909
brother to kind of make a more phthalo

661
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,200
blue type of mixture if you will and use

662
00:26:36,909 --> 00:26:39,519
that to buff out a little bit of cola

663
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,809
and finally to finish off the side like

664
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:42,519
I'm just gonna grab the next vivid

665
00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:44,470
bright light yellow liner and use this

666
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:45,820
to cut the crease gonna quickly curl my

667
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:47,710
lashes and pop on a little bit of Mac

668
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:49,480
extended play mascara and then finally

669
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:51,639
popping on it Lily lost in the style so

670
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:53,409
extra Miami I almost forgot lots of

671
00:26:51,639 --> 00:26:55,179
family at least in a girl banana 4 3 1

672
00:26:53,409 --> 00:26:56,799
and dip into a face a highlighter shade

673
00:26:55,179 --> 00:26:57,519
in the palette and use this to highlight

674
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,960
the brow bone

675
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:00,940
all right scissors and that is how you

676
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,620
guys can create this super simple Bob

677
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:04,059
Ross and start I add makeup look I

678
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:05,440
wonder if you guys at home watching out

679
00:27:04,059 --> 00:27:06,879
we're like oh my god how did he even do

680
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,889
that does the guy was at watching Bob's

681
00:27:06,879 --> 00:27:10,090
Israel earlier on I'm gonna go and

682
00:27:08,889 --> 00:27:11,320
finish it all right off camera quickly

683
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:14,710
and I'll be right back with the final

684
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:16,059
look and my thoughts oh I thought I

685
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:17,769
threw the other eye off camera quickly

686
00:27:16,059 --> 00:27:19,960
somehow that I using the chain of face

687
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:21,610
for my palette of course and a brown

688
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,620
tone of liquid lipstick just took math

689
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:25,480
with like the whole tree vibe and you

690
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:28,059
guys I think that is this a Bob Ross

691
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:30,490
makeup tutorial all complete you guys I

692
00:27:28,059 --> 00:27:33,250
had so much fun from with this video

693
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:34,870
today oh my god I almost bought myself

694
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:36,009
that I waited this long to do it but

695
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:37,750
like I said at the beginning of this

696
00:27:36,009 --> 00:27:39,309
video I've always loved art and had such

697
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:40,210
a passion for it but painting was never

698
00:27:39,309 --> 00:27:40,690
something that I was really thought

699
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:42,429
Creina

700
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:43,779
and for my videos and I am definitely a

701
00:27:42,429 --> 00:27:45,759
perfectionist so I was super nervous

702
00:27:43,779 --> 00:27:47,649
right into this today but following the

703
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:49,509
Bob Ross tutorial made it so much easier

704
00:27:47,649 --> 00:27:51,070
than I would have expected he was so

705
00:27:49,509 --> 00:27:52,690
calm and so sweet and slow which is

706
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:54,340
really great for beginners like me and

707
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:55,690
also I was really only shook at first

708
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:57,100
because he was doing so many different

709
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:59,620
little tips and techniques that made the

710
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:01,000
painting come together so fast I was

711
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:02,590
like literally watching magic infront of

712
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,970
your very eyes but actually watching him

713
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:05,590
doing it and explained how the different

714
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:07,389
techniques work made it easy for me to

715
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:09,009
try to recreate it as well it is very

716
00:28:07,389 --> 00:28:10,960
obvious to me why so many people loved

717
00:28:09,009 --> 00:28:12,700
and watch bob ross not only were his

718
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,679
paintings literally iconic he is so

719
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:16,509
credibly talented but also as well he is

720
00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:17,919
generally just such a great teacher he

721
00:28:16,509 --> 00:28:19,330
explained everything so so well and you

722
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:21,159
can just tell he has a true love for

723
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:22,509
