7 22 in the morning I went to bed at 3

16
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,630
from editing yesterday's video so it

17
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,489
looks like I'm gonna be running on four

18
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,829
hours of sleep today but that's a

19
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:39,329
personal problem not your guys's today's

20
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:41,309
schedule is absolutely jam-packed we

21
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:43,050
have so many fun things to do and also a

22
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:44,760
lot of business to take care of but

23
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,230
unfortunately most of those things that

24
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,600
I have to do today require me to wear a

25
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:50,430
full face of glam makeup even though my

26
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,379
job is a beauty guru my heart lies in

27
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:54,420
doing creative makeup and fun videos and

28
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:56,100
not wearing makeup around for long

29
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,300
periods of time that is in fact one of

30
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,980
my least favorite things in the world

31
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,239
since I'm just gonna be doing my normal

32
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,829
everyday makeup routine that I've

33
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,210
literally showed you guys 64 times

34
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:04,559
already I thought I would try to make

35
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,229
this video a little bit more interesting

36
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,400
by making it into a vlog so I'm gonna

37
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:10,020
take you guys around with me all day

38
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,610
today and to make it even more

39
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,140
interesting we're gonna be testing out a

40
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:16,140
setting spray that claims it can last

41
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,909
for up to 16 hours I honestly have no

42
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,680
idea what time I'm gonna get back home

00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:22,590
tonight and be able to do glam I am

44
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,900

116
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:19,700
[Music]

117
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:21,200
I literally wear the same pair of

118
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,180
eyelashes almost every time doing makeup

119
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,880
now like it's getting a little sad at

120
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:34,640
this point I mean should I stop probably

121
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:36,290
am I gonna stop absolutely not I just

122
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,460
went ahead and I quickly wet my bake off

123
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:39,380
and you guys know that the next up is

124
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:41,150
always Highlander we got to get the glow

125
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,320
on of course but before I do that I'm

126
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,820
gonna go in and spread a face really

127
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,100
really lightly using just the skin a

128
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:48,170
navy eye makeup finishing spray this is

129
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,250
not my Lexus final spurt obviously I'm

130
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,990
just gonna put a little bit of this on

131
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,370
to really like set all those powders in

132
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,810
place and make them melt together and

133
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:55,760
then actually I love doing this before

134
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,990
highlighter as well because it gets the

135
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,190
scanner ready and I feel like it makes

136
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:11,000
the highlighter stick a lot better and

137
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:11,810
just gives a more a blinding luck you

138
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,600
see what I'm talking about

139
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:19,310
whoa I'm gonna be out and about quite a

140
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,630
lot place so I do want to add some blush

141
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:22,490
just to add a little bit of color to my

142
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:24,110
face because I'm looking a little bit

143
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,420
pale and then of course a new lip to

144
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:32,280
finish off this look

145
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:34,569
[Music]

146
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,800
okay wow that s today's look already

147
00:05:34,569 --> 00:05:38,500
complete we literally just did that in

148
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,699
30 minutes I have no idea how I just

149
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,860
pulled that together but I am so

150
00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:43,150
impressing myself right now let's go and

151
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:45,160
finish this look off once and for all

152
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:46,870
using the skin tone a via the makeup and

153
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,490
finishing spray once again this is the

154
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:59,169
oil control version because the sister

155
00:05:48,490 --> 00:06:01,509
gets a little bit of personal grab my

156
00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:03,340
fan do the little warp and then Fanta an

157
00:06:01,509 --> 00:06:04,599
if you guys can once you finish your

158
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:06,190
makeup and use the setting spray I would

159
00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:08,620
always grab a fan or even like a big

160
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:09,880
pallet and use that to dry your face off

161
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:11,380
this is really gonna make the settings

162
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,940
right like melt into the skin and blend

163
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,960
all the powders together and just set

164
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,580
really really smoothly

165
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,500
instead of like setting all crusty and

166
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:19,389
dusty and vanilla cake looking like on

167
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,340
top alright guys and that is this light

168
00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:22,360
glam look off complete the skin to

169
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:25,630
Maivia setting spray you supposed to

170
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:28,330
last for 16 hours on end that is a very

171
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:30,250
very hefty claim and a long time it is

172
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:31,690
currently 921 in the morning and I am

173
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,009
running very very late for everything

174
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:35,710
that I have to do today and there is a

175
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:37,599
lot on the agenda so without further ado

176
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:39,099

00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:40,180

00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:27,280
see any oil or anything oh so good the

245
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:28,630

00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:14,569
where you might wake up for almost 12

292
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:18,740
hours now I think that is ten hours we

293
00:11:14,569 --> 00:11:20,629
love a mouth but yeah it still looks so

294
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:21,199
good like I would have not done any

295
00:11:20,629 --> 00:11:27,800
touch-ups

296
00:11:21,199 --> 00:11:30,319
are you kidding oh so good this needed

297
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:33,410
hello sisters I just got back home and

298
00:11:30,319 --> 00:11:35,630
it's currently 11:47 p.m. meeting I've

299
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:40,339
had this makeup on now for more than 14

300
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:41,750
hours oh my god I am being 150 % honest

301
00:11:40,339 --> 00:11:44,300
by saying I have not touched up my face

302
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:47,000
once today and looking in the mirror it

303
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:48,439
looks still so good if we're being picky

304
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,240
here my lips are obviously a little bit

305
00:11:48,439 --> 00:11:51,649
crusty because I was just eating I do

306
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,790
have a smile crease but literally I

307
00:11:51,649 --> 00:11:54,949
always get that that's because I smile

308
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:56,930
all day every day and my under eyes are

309
00:11:54,949 --> 00:11:58,550
creasing as well but literally like look

310
00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:00,949
at my freaking skin it still looks

311
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:02,540
flawless if anything is looking a little

312
00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:04,519
bit early I would say it's my nose but

313
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:06,529
like I'm not even mad at it that happens

314
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:08,149
all the time no matter what and usually

315
00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:10,370
it happens within like one hour of me

316
00:12:08,149 --> 00:12:11,750
doing my makeup it's been 14 I'm

317
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:13,220
honestly beyond impressed it out with

318
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,750
those skin and navy eye makeup finishing

319
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:16,550
spray this claims that it's supposed to

320
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:18,410
last for 16 hours and obviously I only

321
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:19,819
wore it for 14 but let's be real who's

322
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:21,829
gonna wear makeup for 16 hours straight

323
00:12:19,819 --> 00:12:23,720
first of all not me I'll tell you that

324
00:12:21,829 --> 00:12:24,980
right now I think it's very safe to say

325
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,500
at this point that this setting spray is

326
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:29,000
a huge huge win in my book as well as

327
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,189
the primer spray as well both the oil

328
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,720
control versions like I said my face

329
00:12:31,189 --> 00:12:35,389
looks so beat still

330
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,980
14 hours I'm ready to take this off yes

331
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:40,850
but if I need it to keep going out with

332
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:41,930
this what I yeah probably if you guys

333
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:43,189
