my ground and like you know being a part

166
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,800
of the hype house just by being in that

167
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,990
first photo

168
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,760
it was establish a moment exactly still

169
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:53,320
like it just happened like it didn't

170
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,580
even mean it wasn't even like on

171
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,620
intentionally or anything I was just

172
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:59,110
like I was in the photos and then that's

173
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:00,520
when the hype house began it's like you

174
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:03,280
know what when you what was the word you

175
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:05,470
used or is I presume that any resides

176
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,630
and I'm resigned and decided to pursue

177
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:09,280
other dreams you know that's so cool

178
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:11,770
mm-hmm I think I really appreciate that

179
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,000
details okay so one thing that you

180
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:14,380
mentioned about your mom being

181
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,400
supportive I think is really cool what

182
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,870
is it like having your parents like

183
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,690
involved with the whole tik-tok

184
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:21,160
situation like active on it yeah cuz

185
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:23,620
your parents are both tech talk stars as

186
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,510
well yeah so my mom she started it

187
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:27,070
because I was making videos with her so

188
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,940
like my first videos to actually blow up

189
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:29,680
were with my mom

190
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:31,090
ya know the really big blow up ones so

191
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,070
she ended up making a tick-tock account

192
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:35,169
because everyone was like oh my gosh

193
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:36,669
your mom should have her own so she made

194
00:06:35,169 --> 00:06:38,139
her own and like now she has I think

195
00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:39,580
like three million over three million

196
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:41,680
fires I think she has 3.5 million

197
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:43,240
dollars so she like kind of established

198
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,639

you guys did a big like Entertainment

216
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,000
Tonight

217
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:13,140
interview and like it was like the first

218
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,100
time like the height most ever did like

219
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,420
something as a group which was super

220
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,040
interesting to watch but there was a lot

221
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:18,300
of criticism in the comments and adjust

222
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,670
ages from people in general but like

223
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:22,380
think tick tock errs do nothing so like

224
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:24,060
what does the day-to-day schedule of

225
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:25,290
Addison rate look like and just like

226
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,970
walk us to it because even from like

227
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:29,190
hanging out you guys it's definitely not

228
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:30,480
nothing like that's for sure yeah so

229
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:32,490
like being on tick tock I feel like

230
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,870
people do have like the idea that it is

231
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:35,160
a bunch of nothing and like we're just

232
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:37,080
saying our rims and like making videos

233
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,270
and it's super easy but I feel like on

234
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,740
YouTube you have to make good content or

235
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:42,510
like people aren't gonna watch it it's

236
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:44,160
like the same thing so like yeah it may

237
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:46,080
be a 15-second video but it's like you

238
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,000
want to make it the best 15 seconds that

239
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,650
anyone's ever watched you know so like

240
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,150
it goes with like a lot of time and

241
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:53,130
learning the dances coming up with the

242
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:55,020
dances coming up with skin and yeah tick

243
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:56,130
tock maybe a 15-second video but it's

244
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,630
like when we're working on other

245
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:59,220
platforms as well like I've been doing

246
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:00,720
YouTube videos and then like doing

247
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:02,040
instagrams and like really active on

248
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,980
like Twitter and snapchat it's like it's

249
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:06,180
all a big job even from me try to learn

250
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,830
like dances and stuff it takes you like

251
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:09,000
at least 30 minutes to an hour every

252
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:13,020
time but I want to do well because I can

253
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,580
never figure them out useful yeah okay

254
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:17,340

lot about how like obviously it's really

261
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:30,840
important for both of us to be a good

262
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,310
role model in front of our audiences

263
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,390
good morning sisters but like one of my

264
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:34,470
biggest things for this year has been

265
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:36,390
like being a little bit more

unapologetically myself yeah the last

267
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,450
four years I've treated my job super

268
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:40,860
professionally which obviously it should

269
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:42,150
be but this year I've been carrying a

270
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,230
little bit less and trying to have more

00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:44,850
fun and being more out there like

272
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:46,440
censoring myself a little bit less and

don't obviously understand like what

293
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:27,910
goes on behind the scenes and I think

294
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:29,380

295
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:31,360

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,350
that's true it's true how would you say

327
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:37,000
that you say positive even when you're

328
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:38,290
dealing with like personal stuff or like

329
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,110
stressful stuff like we were talking

330
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:42,820
about how bubbly person we have I've

331
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:44,860
always been like very bubbly very

332
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:46,060
outgoing and I guess um like you said

333
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,530
you're you know a very social person

334
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:49,300
I've always been that way as well they

335
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:50,860
always love to be around people and like

336
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:52,060
have relationships like personal

337
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:54,610
relationships with everyone you know

338
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:56,350
right I feel like that in itself just

339
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:58,300
translated to my personality on the

340
00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:00,070
internet and like being very welcoming

341
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,960
and being very positive and like keeping

342
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:03,430
that side of me alive for me it's just

343
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,140
staying surrounded by the people that

344
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:06,910
make me feel like a better person and

345
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:08,710
then that kind of just makes everything

346
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:10,870
fall into place that's why I love being

347
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:12,610
around you oh because you're always

348
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:15,490
positive I'm sure we're gonna round you

349
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:17,080

that's like stuck with you well I feel

353
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:25,150
like a golden goddess we're gonna cut

354
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,100
carrots for a little bit into the other

355
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:29,440

envisioning

361
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:39,430

00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:47,350
on top these aren't the lily lofts in

and you can use Coe James for a 15% off

370
00:11:51,010 --> 00:12:00,010

373
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:05,800
fun question for you yeah so I don't

374
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,590

00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:10,540
going to LSU and setting to be a sports

376
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:12,580
broadcaster just super super cool

377
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:14,110
obviously tick tock has you know taken

378
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:16,240
over a little bit of that career path

379
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:17,800
first of all without every sentiments I

380
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,880
want to do in the future or like what to

381
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,340
you you know like what do you want to

382
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:24,220
use your platform to do in the future I

383
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:26,530
honestly think that I'm gonna take this

384
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,880
and bring it to like hosting yeah no I

385
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:29,440
would love to do that I would love to do

386
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,120
hosting things I really want to get more

387
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,440
active on YouTube and like really just

388
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,760
trying to establish myself on YouTube

389
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,290
with you guys I've been up trying to

390
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,980
force her to do YouTube videos okay I

391
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:40,210
did one last week for sure alright you

392
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:42,040
guys so the look is almost complete all

393
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:43,750
we have left is going to be the labs for

394
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,400
this look we were deciding between a rad

395
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:48,160
and a nude and I think I might be

396
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,540
looking so it's so stunning but for some

397
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,580
reason I think this is like pulling us

398
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:54,130
up like a glossy nude and high fashion

399
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:55,480
direction so gonna do a lip by if you

400
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:56,560
guys want to see it with a red lip let

401
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,940
us know because we could always do

402
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,290
another video in the future

403
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,490
so we're just gonna go and I'm gonna use

404
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:02,860
the matte lip liner in the shade of

405
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:03,820
spice to line her lips first and then on

406
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:06,040
top of that look later I'm gonna grab

407
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:07,900
the k'kaw Beauty at number two nude

408
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:10,090
lipstick and then I'm just gonna finish

409
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:11,890
it off with a little pop of gloss in the

410
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:13,300
middle already guys in the last step

411
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:16,510
we're just going to lock it in place so

412
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:17,890
it lasts all day long Bernie go off

413
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:19,030
camera quickly get out of some chains do

414
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:21,490
