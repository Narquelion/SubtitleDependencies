luckily I'm full of freaking coverage

00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:24,470
love I think there are so many people

57
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:27,420
especially nowadays that are like I

58
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:29,370
can't believe never serious on that one

59
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,410
well especially like in like

60
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:33,120
Pennsylvania if you're wearing a lot of

61
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:34,830
makeup that immediately makes you like

62
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,690
like if you went to school like that and

63
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:40,040
everything yeah you'd get called so many

64
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:42,120
names because that's just not normal in

65
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:44,670
C when I was actually in high school I

66
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:48,330
think I only wore makeup to school twice

67
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:51,600
I I mean either I never cared that yeah

68
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:57,270
oh I was I literally didn't wear because

69
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:58,680
I was too lazy to yeah like when you

70
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:04,170
don't have any hair it's not like I can

71
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:05,940
do my hair up all night oh my god

72
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:08,220
speaking of it looks like on the

73
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:12,300
original video because obviously so

74
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:13,830
inspire them um I wrote I suffer from a

75
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,630
location just lost all my hair to the

76
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:17,250
condition I cried for hours because I

77
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:19,110
felt like my long hair to find my beauty

78
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:21,239
I felt embarrassed to leave the house

79
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:22,530
without a wig makeup helps me walk out

80
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:24,690
the door every day and still feel like a

81
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:26,730
queen without my hair it is a huge

82
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:28,020
stress relief doing my makeup in the

83
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:29,790
morning and feeling confident enough to

84
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:31,560
go out with my friends and be myself I

85
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:33,209
honestly would be hiding in my house if

86
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,030
it weren't for makeup and amazing people

87
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:38,880
like you to make me feel beautiful I

88
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:41,040
love you James oh yeah I love that

89
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,690
confidence because like most people like

90
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,800
obviously that gets a very very heart

91
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:46,230
disease for a lot of people to do and

92
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,820
like truly does show like certain like

93
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:49,500
body parts or accessories like aren't

94
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,940
needed or that's what we're to put it

95
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,470
but certain things are needed for video

96
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:54,930
yeah that's like staring septic you

97
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:56,670
don't need long flowy curly locks to be

98
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:58,350
beautiful like you don't need like a

99
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:01,230
beef AC beautiful either like I love it

100
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:02,970
you're oh that's just in terms me so

101
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:04,709
much I'm so so freakin happy that you're

102
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:05,610
here when if you don't be asking when

103
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:08,280
were you diagnosed

104
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:09,870
alopecia is like yeah tell me about it

105
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,150
cuz I love it I'm just to be honest I

106
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:14,670
really I'm not familiar with it I never

107
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:16,579
really went to get diagnosed per se

108
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:17,810
because I was kind of like

109
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:21,379
Barriss at the time especially when I

110
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:23,300
first got it but I mean especially I

111
00:04:21,379 --> 00:04:24,439
mean I've been told by my just family

112
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,210
doctor there's nothing else that it

113
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:29,330
could be right so I mean obviously

114
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:31,699
that's what it is but um alopecia areata

115
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:34,129
is the type that I have which is just

116
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:35,810
the way that it falls out is the second

117
00:04:34,129 --> 00:04:38,719
part areata means it falls out in

118
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:42,439
circles or out your head okay about five

119
00:04:38,719 --> 00:04:43,939
months ago now that is I was was when

120
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:49,009
the first patch fell out so this was

121
00:04:43,939 --> 00:04:51,409
recent though yeah okay and about three

122
00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:52,940
months after that I decided to

123
00:04:51,409 --> 00:04:53,419
completely shave my head for the first

124
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:57,409
time

125
00:04:53,419 --> 00:05:00,259
lava yeah because I most of my hair had

126
00:04:57,409 --> 00:05:02,180
already fallen out and I believe that

127
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:05,180
there was just no point in keeping it

128
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:07,159
for the rest of it because I mean I

129
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:09,819
thought I looked more like a goofball

130
00:05:07,159 --> 00:05:12,590
with like just three patches of hair and

131
00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:14,659
no hair at all no I rather just had no

132
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:15,830
hair at all yeah I was looking your

133
00:05:14,659 --> 00:05:18,560

136
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,180
talking about drag earlier how like me I

137
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,860

fair skin I don't want to use regular

148
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:42,740
glue because if I make you look really

00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,279
definitely like I started doing makeup

156
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:57,080
right when all this started coming out

157
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:59,659
that like you can set your face with

158
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:02,839

162
00:06:06,229 --> 00:06:10,370
time yeah well like I even remember it

163
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:12,199

00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,460
when eyes are doing makeup Oh

165
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:15,110

313
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:01,180

314
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,740
the worst thing in the world
