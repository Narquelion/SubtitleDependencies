00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,540
hi sisters James Charles here and

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:05,009
welcome back to my youtube channel so as

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,330
you guys know I did recently switch over

4
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:09,150
to doing three videos a week which is

5
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:10,230
such a fun challenge for me it is truly

6
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,210
so much more work than I was

7
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,469
anticipating but I'm absolutely loving

8
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,639
making all these videos for you guys and

9
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:16,830
I really hope you are enjoying them as

10
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,180
well speaking of making a lot of videos

11
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,619
for the past week videos they've all

12
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,210
been a super super makeup and glam

13
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:22,289
oriented I mean I even jumped in a

14
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,490
freaking pool with the full face of

15
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:25,350
makeup on to show you guys that

16
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,460
waterproof makeup is possible definitely

17
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,380
check that video out if you have not

18
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,210
already but for today's video I wanted

19
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,650
to just sit down throw on some likely

20
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,600
I'm adjusting a little bit more personal

21
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,399
with you guys a few videos ago I did a

22
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,450
more personal Q&A where I insert a lot

23
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:38,160
of questions that you guys wanted to

24
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,420
know about being an influencer or being

25
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,590
a beauty guru and just kind of questions

26
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,600
in general that nobody really really

27
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,370
likes to answer or give the honest truth

28
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,710
to I don't actually think I answer any

29
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,980
other questions in the actual video

30
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:48,510
oopsies

31
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,760
but I know I did get a ton of questions

32
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,500
about PR packages getting free makeup

33
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,660
for brands what that entails is that

34
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,039
sponsored yada yada yada so for today's

35
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,270
video I thought I would unbox a bunch of

36
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,890
PR package that I've been saving for the

37
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,059
last few weeks it's been like three

38
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,859
weeks since I've actually unboxed any

39
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:03,359
new products I've been dying to get my

40
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:05,189
hands on these and do some swatches so

41
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,420
without further ado let's show you guys

42
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:08,020
some of the free makeup that I get on a

43
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,190
daily basis

44
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:11,190
[Music]

45
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,630
the first Tiger to open is for my babes

46
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,950
over at Benefit Cosmetics and I'm so

47
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,750
frickin excited to open this because I

48
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,580
just love benefits so much and they're

49
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,200
PR packages are literally always so

50
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,790
adorable if you guys follow me on SAP

51
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,560
I've done a few unboxings over there and

52
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,420
they're always so well thought out and

53
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,890
put together they have by far one of the

54
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,840
strongest PR teams of any brand I know

55
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:33,060
so definitely a major left to benefit

56
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,530
and you didn't hear this from me but you

57
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,780
may want to keep your eyes peeled for

58
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:38,220
something with James and benefit coming

59
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,869
through so in the box comes a little

60
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,090
curl that says sister James enjoy the

61
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:45,299
new goodies xoxo a sister Stephanie and

62
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:47,299
any year we have a [ __ ] official makeup

63
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:49,500
so I guess this might be their new

64
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:51,390
Porefessional line I think there are

65
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,920
three of them and they come in one two

66
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:54,869
and three if you can see that on the top

67
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,250
I guess one three two in this case but

68
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:58,820
these are the pore fessional pore

69
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:01,680
minimizing makeup and I guess this is a

70
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:03,570
3-step system so the back it says makeup

71
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,979
to minimize the appearance of pores you

72
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:07,049
all know sister James could definitely

73
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:08,520
use some help in that area and it says

74
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:10,200
covers imperfections without calling in

75
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,210
pores and that is step one step two

76
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,190
smooth and reduces the look of pore

77
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:16,910
and step three instantly modifies and

78
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:21,240
controls access service for eight hours

79
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:24,150
okay that's a big claim I'm so confused

80
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,560
Oh press Oh okay so number three is

81
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:27,120
obviously a liquid I have no idea what

82
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,620
numbers 1 & 2 are but I definitely want

83
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,940
to find out because like I said it's

84
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,220
sister James definite need some help in

85
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,240
the pour department that is for sure so

86
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,740
if you guys want to see me try these out

87
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,120

88
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:38,400

00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:36,000

ever PR package from Tasha you guys know

124
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,570
I'd like to be very very unbiased when

125
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,610
it comes to this stuff but I will say I

126
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:49,020
am very very very excited to open this

127
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:50,520
I've heard that their skin care stuff is

128
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,930
so good and you guys know that I don't

129
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,760

130
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:56,220
wanting to start it so this is a perfect

131
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,780

radiance mask and by the name of us

this looks so good I'm gonna open up

144
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,990

145
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,040
violet oh it is oh wow that is so pretty

146
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,300

better hit me up soon sister all right

150
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,900
so this next package is once again a

151
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:36,180
pretty pretty big one and it's also very

152
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,800
very heavy too I don't recognize the

153
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,270
name on this box so I have no idea what

154
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,470
this is or how they got my address in

155
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:46,740
the first place let's go ahead and open

156
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:48,240
this up what is this the first thing I

157
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:50,130
see is this pamphlet that has a

158
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:54,990
marijuana leaf on it and now I'm

159
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:57,090
horrified is this literally a PR package

160
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:58,620
of drugs telling this doesn't look like

161
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:59,940
the most illegal medicine that has ever

162
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:04,650
been sent in the mail are you kidding

163
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:06,540
this has CBD syrup all natural hemp wait

164
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:09,030
a second you guys know sister James does

165
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:10,350
not do drugs or drink I'm a good boy but

166
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:12,360
if I'm remembering correctly from last

167
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:19,350
year's science class I'm pretty sure

168
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:22,110
that hemp is like in weed is this

169
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:23,580
literally a package of marijuana okay at

170
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:25,680
this point I am convinced and also

171
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:28,050
horrified that I may have just received

172
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,340
a package of illegal substances to my

173
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:31,590
apartment so I'm going to read this

174
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:34,530
pamphlet now all the way through and see

175
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:34,980
what the tea is because this is not what

176
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:37,470
I want

177
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:39,540
this cloud9 syrup is the number one

178
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:42,600
selling hemp ocf infused with pure hemp

179
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:45,060
CBD and nine all-natural herbs

180
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,980
it's legal and okay that's what I needed

181
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,750
to hear it's legal and safe to use with

182
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:50,730
positive health benefits that support

183
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:52,170
increase in happiness temporary relief

184
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:53,820
as well as many ailments extreme

185
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:55,020
relaxation as well as amazing flavors

186
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:58,140
that you mix with your favorite drinks

187
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:59,670
that you'll love our kid of an idol that

188
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,960
sounds like cannabis we're back to the

189
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:03,180
weed thing okay so what I'm gathering

190
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,190
here is that these substances are legal

191
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:06,990
which is wonderful that means I won't be

192
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:08,460
doing my makeup from the jail cell thank

193
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:10,110
God I'm still not exactly hundred

194
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,160
percent sure what these actually are I'm

195
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:13,290
just gonna go ahead and put this box

196
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,150
away you guys think whatever services

00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:17,070
you want in your body but Swisher James

198
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:18,930
gonna stay clean all right so this next

199
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:20,790
package is from our sisters over Anasazi

200
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:22,440
at Beverly Hills and I think I know what

201
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:27,810
this is and I'm so excited to open this

202
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:29,220
up all right so this is the box that

203
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:31,200
comes inside of the box and their

204
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:32,790
packaging is always so beautiful so

205
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:36,120
sleek and just super super modern and

206
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:37,260
simplistic and I love that yes oh my god

207
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,159
it is what I thought and is they're

208
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:41,189
brand new

209
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:42,809
Anasazi liquid glow illuminators I am so

210
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:44,699
excited for these so it looks like these

211
00:06:42,809 --> 00:06:46,529
liquid glow illuminators come in four

212
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:49,199
different shades being called Perla

213
00:06:46,529 --> 00:06:50,699
oyster bronze and peach phase and I have

214
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,439
been waiting for these for so long

215
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:54,389
following the Anasazi snaps an Instagram

216
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:56,009
page they looked a little reso Bob on

217
00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:57,449
all the promo pictures and you guys know

218
00:06:56,009 --> 00:06:58,830
that their illuminator in so Hollywood

219
00:06:57,449 --> 00:07:01,439
is by far my favorite highlighter ever

220
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:02,550
I'm wearing it today as always so honest

221
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:04,289
all day it definitely does not play

222
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,249
right when it comes to that glow let's

223
00:07:04,289 --> 00:07:06,779
go ahead and test one of these out

224
00:07:05,249 --> 00:07:08,039
looking at the little color things on

225
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:09,749
the top it's looking like peach face

226
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:12,029
would probably be the best match for a

227
00:07:09,749 --> 00:07:14,279
James Charles skin tone highlight so

228
00:07:12,029 --> 00:07:16,169
let's pop her out of the box oh my god

229
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:18,539
this is actually huge too for a liquid

230
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:20,009
highlighter it's 0.628 fluid ounces

231
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:22,169
which is literally almost the same size

232
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:23,219
as most foundations that's really crazy

233
00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:31,589
I'm gonna squeeze a little bit of peach

234
00:07:23,219 --> 00:07:33,029
fuzz onto like my hand oh wow oh wow you

235
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:34,019
can literally see just me moving my hand

236
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:36,869
I'm looking at the monitor right now

237
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:37,709
against the light these are so metallic

238
00:07:36,869 --> 00:07:41,009
and beautiful I am

239
00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:42,990
shook to the core this is like blinding

240
00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:44,309
next-level highway right now the formula

241
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:46,019
feels really really nice it's definitely

242
00:07:44,309 --> 00:07:47,639
like a very very creamy consistency and

243
00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:48,779
not too liquidy as well which is

244
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:50,669
wonderful that means it's not going to

245
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:51,929
move around on the face I mean I love a

246
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:53,219
good highlighter but we're not trying to

247
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:54,749
do the full face of Highlander challenge

248
00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:55,889
every day so I definitely am a little

249
00:07:54,749 --> 00:07:57,119
bit concerned though being that this is

250
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:58,349
one of the lighter shades of the

251
00:07:57,119 --> 00:07:59,669
collection and as you can see when the

252
00:07:58,349 --> 00:08:01,379
light isn't hitting it it definitely

253
00:07:59,669 --> 00:08:02,999
leaves a pretty pretty dark reflection

254
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:04,319
so I'm very curious to see how that'll

255
00:08:02,999 --> 00:08:06,029
actually look on my skin I will

256
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,199
definitely try those out very very soon

257
00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:08,909
so let me know if you guys want to see a

258
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,259
video with those alright so last but

259
00:08:08,909 --> 00:08:11,849
certainly not least we have this package

260
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:13,469
from our sisters over at makeup forever

261
00:08:11,849 --> 00:08:14,309
and just like with benefit makeup

262
00:08:13,469 --> 00:08:16,319
forever it is one of those companies

263
00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:17,879
that truly does have such an amazing PR

264
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,229
team they really do care about their

265
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:21,149
customers and their influencers which is

266
00:08:19,229 --> 00:08:23,399
so amazing and is like the best quality

267
00:08:21,149 --> 00:08:26,819
a brand can have but all personal bias

268
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:28,110
aside let's get to the makeup oh my god

269
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:30,149
if this is what I think it is this is

270
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:31,379
something very very very special so

271
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:34,110
there's a little card inside that says

272
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:35,909
we asked six of our friends to make the

273
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:37,259
perfect artist face color palette so

274
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:39,240
here's how they made their show us how

275
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:41,699
you make yours probably makeup forever

276
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,319
oh my god so not only do we have sister

277
00:08:41,699 --> 00:08:45,810
Kim who created her little trio but we

278
00:08:43,319 --> 00:08:46,980
also have sister Cassie so if I'm

279
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:49,199
reading this correctly all six

280
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,210
influences created a trio of a bronzer a

281
00:08:49,199 --> 00:08:52,130
blush and a high

282
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:53,570
and Cassie says I love about the

283
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:54,770
versatility of my artists face color

284
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:56,540
trio palette can be applied with a

285
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:57,620
subtle touch for a super soft flame or

286
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:59,750
kicked up a notch for a little more

287
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,370
intensity love that all three shades

288
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:03,470
conveniently fit in a small compact

289
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:04,700
pallet perfect for a vanity fave or

290
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:07,279
chucked in a small makeup bag for

291
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:09,740
on-the-go I'm obsessed with H 102 highly

292
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,209

much as I do

295
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:15,350

00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:17,000
by him soul beyond pronto sister Cassie

297
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:18,380

298
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,940
makeup artists that I know if you guys

products being three highlighters three

306
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,740
contours and three blushes and these are

307
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:35,240
the three that sister Cassie paired

308
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,260
together but I'm not actually gonna open
