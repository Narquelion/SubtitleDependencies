46
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,009

47
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:39,829
I'm out of town for two weeks so we saw

48
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:41,850
each other luckily picked out one dog

49
00:01:39,829 --> 00:01:43,570
well all my looks are the same so I

50
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,840
didn't think it'd be too difficult

51
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:47,909
[Music]

52
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:50,700
literally is like a red smokey eye leave

53
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:52,829
no lipstick Nick did that one it's

54
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,869
literally it's a red blown-out smokey

55
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:56,159
eye okay yes a good and fresh copper

56
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:57,780
shimmer like a little bit of a cut

57
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,280
crease but more than anything just like

58
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,890
really intense like

59
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,420

so this look that I picked out for you

63
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,200

00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:13,730

86

talk to you about today what got you

87
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:28,790
started into my god and to make up or

88
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:31,190
into YouTube makeup I guess my mom is

89
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:32,720
being such a beauty girl my mom has

90
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:34,340
always been obsessed with makeup and

91
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,139
fashion and hair and like she just hid

92
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,010
her vanity every single night before she

93
00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:39,380
washed her face and played with her

94
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:40,400
makeup and I'm so burned watch her she

95
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,989
just vehicle I'm just teaching myself

96
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,819
new techniques and she played makeup

97
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:45,859
like an hour every single night and then

98
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:47,540
she wash her face and go to bed and so I

99
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:49,940
just watched her do it and I was like I

100
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:52,069
love this he's got interested in it

101
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:53,510
but it's so cool and why did you start

102
00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:54,829
YouTube I started doing YouTube because

103
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:56,420
everyone on instagram has asked me for

104
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:57,829
after my Instagram page started gaining

105
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:00,410
followers but I started doing makeup and

106
00:03:57,829 --> 00:04:02,420
predominantly because of this right here

107
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:03,590
sitting next to me every single time you

108
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:05,810
say that I still don't believe you and I

109
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:07,220
think it's so cool yeah sort of all the

110
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:09,889
growth that you've had and being so

111
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:12,739
young and having this incredible success

112
00:04:09,889 --> 00:04:14,599
so quickly but you are still able to

113
00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:15,230
like sit here and give credit to

114
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:17,389
somebody

115
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:18,799
I think the humble of you and so cool of

116
00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:21,620
you because most people when they get to

117
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,550
like your stature they would not even

118
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,789
remember that and they would be like oh

119
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:25,509
well I did this on my

120
00:04:23,789 --> 00:04:27,130
you know what I'm saying and I think

121
00:04:25,509 --> 00:04:28,509
it's really cool like you still sit here

122
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:30,789
to say that about me and that really

123
00:04:28,509 --> 00:04:32,319
like it's very humbling for me and it

124
00:04:30,789 --> 00:04:35,080
inspires me I remember literally being

125
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:36,430
like 11 12 13 not doing makeup yacht but

126
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,449
watching all the beauty tutorials and

127
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,620
like Jacqueline was like the main one

128
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:39,819
that I would always watch like when you

129
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,560
were sitting on your floor still working

130
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:43,300
it back and the way I just number like

131
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,440
everything you'd put on your eyelids

132
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,919
because you have like the best eye shape

133
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,180
ever

134
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:47,500
I literally really I need that product

135
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,789
right now I was like I don't even wear

136
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,650
makeup what am i doing when I did

137
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:52,750
surgery makeup eventually you were like

138
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:54,220
the first beauty guru ever noticed me I

139
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,990
remember it vividly I remember actually

140
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,099
where I was sitting I was at my mom's

141
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:58,569
house and I was having dinner with my

142
00:04:57,099 --> 00:05:01,930
family and it was a Sunday night like I

143
00:04:58,569 --> 00:05:03,699

144
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:06,699

149
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:14,349

150
00:05:12,699 --> 00:05:16,120

00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:17,830
gosh okay so as far as trend I would say

184
00:06:15,849 --> 00:06:19,659
when Kim Kardashian and Mario posted

185
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:21,430
that picture of all that yellow and her

186
00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:22,900
in her t-zone yeah I remember like that

187
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:24,490
was so iconic and there were articles

188
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,409
everywhere and everyone was like oh my

189
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:27,789
gosh what is this trend

190
00:06:26,409 --> 00:06:29,770
dad was like my favorite moment and make

191
00:06:27,789 --> 00:06:31,419
a pissed Sri as I've been around for as

192
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:33,370
an adult like witness like firsthand

193
00:06:31,419 --> 00:06:34,719
because that changed my makeup routine

194
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:36,740
and it's something that we all utilize

195
00:06:34,719 --> 00:06:38,240
now like we all put like light

196
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,770
and light powder in the center of our

197
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,569
face to really bring like everything

198
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:43,699
forward and create that heart shape yep

199
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:45,590
like that ideal face shape if you will

200
00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:46,880
and that's all because of Kim and Mario

201
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:48,410
which is why no matter how much people

202
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,810
talk bad about Kim I'm always like she's

203
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:53,360
Shawn is really she's a legend when it

204
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:55,220

205
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,810

I don't know well I like some egg

316
00:10:54,069 --> 00:10:58,240
I like the ground that I stand on her

317
00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:00,069
not to be in the air and I would prefer

318
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,290
also not to be burned but I love a good

319
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:03,519
campfire so I need to know now hey

320
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:04,420
that's great my face idea isn't working

321
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:11,639
right now that's when you know that you

322
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:11,639
look alright

323
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:21,939
Oh kinda I'm finally moving on to eyes

324
00:11:20,439 --> 00:11:23,499
now I think the Lord in heaven above

325
00:11:21,939 --> 00:11:25,209
eighty seven years later enough my

326
00:11:23,499 --> 00:11:26,860
eyebrows are finally even John we were

327
00:11:25,209 --> 00:11:29,800
talking earlier how like you took a much

328
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:32,170
needed mental break for a while yes

329
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,639
yes as a close friend of you you didn't

330
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:34,990
need that very much so and now you're

331
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:36,519
kind of like slowly easing your weight

332
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:38,679
back into YouTube when you obviously got

333
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:40,689
on the platform for a very long time now

334
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:41,889
where do you think the industry and the

335
00:11:40,689 --> 00:11:44,079
makeup communities kind of had it

336
00:11:41,889 --> 00:11:46,869
because I feel like right now it's in a

337
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:48,339
little bit of like a rough moment it is

338
00:11:46,869 --> 00:11:51,670
it's hard for creators right now yeah

339
00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:53,230
it's way harder than it used to be and

340
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:55,329
like with all like the algorithm changes

341
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:57,459
like it's so different and it's so like

342
00:11:55,329 --> 00:11:59,829
saturated now with so much content and

343
00:11:57,459 --> 00:12:02,410
so much incredible content and so many

344
00:11:59,829 --> 00:12:04,360
incredible artists and like it's a lot

345
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:06,309
to like be successful in this industry

346
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,410
now it was so much easier and so much

347
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:10,420
more simple back in the day people used

348
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:11,679
to just want makeup tutorials like

349
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:14,679
that's all they wanted and they feel

350
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:16,179
like now so many people are like okay we

351
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:17,499
know how to do makeup now like we want

352
00:12:16,179 --> 00:12:19,689
more and they want like really

353
00:12:17,499 --> 00:12:20,649
entertaining videos that have to do with

354
00:12:19,689 --> 00:12:21,850
beauty and I think that's why your

355
00:12:20,649 --> 00:12:23,110
channel is so incredibly successful

356
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:25,360
because you put so much effort into

357
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:26,740
doing that and it's very difficult to do

358
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,309
the kind of videos did you do but you

359
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:29,709
make it happen

360
00:12:27,309 --> 00:12:31,749
where is I feel like my followers if I

361
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:33,910
don't do like makeup tutorials they get

362
00:12:31,749 --> 00:12:34,749
upset yeah we want the makeup because

363
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:36,579
that's what I'm known for

364
00:12:34,749 --> 00:12:37,990
yeah you know but I feel like that's

365
00:12:36,579 --> 00:12:39,549
very rare like do you think you'll

366
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:41,079
forever do tutorials like do you want to

367
00:12:39,549 --> 00:12:42,249
keep doing that well in that sense so

368
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:43,569
like you haven't here for a long time

369
00:12:42,249 --> 00:12:45,129
your followers do love tutorials but do

370
00:12:43,569 --> 00:12:46,839
you think you wanna branch out more and

371
00:12:45,129 --> 00:12:47,889
they kind of join in with that like oh

372
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:49,119
absolutely

373
00:12:47,889 --> 00:12:50,140

00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:59,650
have someone to actually warn me and not

379
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,780
just a tripod the things can be totally

380
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:03,130
different and I have a lot of ideas yeah

381
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,780
I'm really excited to actually branch

382
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:06,190

383
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:12,910

502
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:42,700
question for you would be what piece of

503
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:44,230
advice would you give to any young girls

504
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,700

505
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:48,040
with makeup or who may want to be like a

506
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:51,460
beauty influencer one day I would say as

507
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:52,570
far as advice to you know someone

508
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:54,790
wanting to get started in this industry

509
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:56,860
or just loving makeup girl or boy is to

510
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:58,560
honestly not be intimidated by all the

511
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:00,850
incredible artists out there because

512
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:02,500
especially now with how many amazing

513
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:04,090
artists aren't Instagram like when I was

514
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,380
younger I didn't have social media to

515
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:07,240
run to like it was like the beauty

516
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:08,200
magazines and what you saw on TV and now

517
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,640
it's like you just like turn on your

518
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,440
phone and it's everywhere and it's such

519
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,940
an incredible makeup and then on top of

520
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,830
like the photo shop in the face tuning

521
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:16,360
and some of it is so over the top and

522
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:18,130
they're completely doing their their

523
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,270
makeup literally with Photoshop and bass

524
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,710
tuned and it doesn't look like that at

525
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:22,030
all in person so and to not be

526
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:23,860
intimidated by someone who has been

527
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:27,070
doing makeup for years you know like us

528
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:30,220
when we started we all had moments of

529
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:32,020
absolute suckage I think even you like

530
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:33,340
starting off you were so incredible just

531
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:35,350
right out the gate and that's extremely

532
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:37,330
rare but still when I see you do looks

533
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:40,750
now compared to when you started on my

534
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:42,520
whoa oh my gosh luck marry we've all had

535
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,870
makeup I didn't realize how much better

536
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,430
you could get like you're blending has

537
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:46,930
gotten better your contour has gotten

538
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:48,460
better your everything is gone better

539
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:49,750
you know you know you were so incredible

540
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,640
just starting off I personally did not

541
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,990
start off great like I've always had a

542
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,760
knack for I've always loved it you know

543
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:56,170
I was self-taught but like I used to be

544
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,310
very harsh literally a lot of harsh

545
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:59,140
lines I would just say to not be

546
00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:01,000
intimidated by everybody else who has

547
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:02,710
been practicing for a long time and

548
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,300
working really hard at their artistry so

549
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:05,440
definitely not to be intimidated there

550
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,850
are so many talented artists out there

551
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,230
and I'm always exerting for a new talent

552
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:09,940
and for a new and upcoming artists that

553
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:11,200
you can help out or support or like Paul

554
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,610
or just like to check out and get

555
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,140
inspiration in general and one thing I

556
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:16,120
see all the time are people who are so

557
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:17,500
incredibly talented but I often times

558
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,330
see a lot of people that like have the

559
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,530
best talent but just complaining on

560
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,850
Twitter all day long about them not

561
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:23,230
getting recognized or they're not making

562
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:24,460
it are them not getting brand deals and

563
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,630
stuff you have to be focused on the

564
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:27,220
talent but what's really gonna get you

565
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:28,450
to the top is your personality there was

566
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,890
a moment on YouTube where like everyone

567
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:31,120
was copying everyone like whoever was

568
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:32,560
getting views everybody was trying to

569
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,660
act like that person just being yourself

570
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,340
don't think that you have to like overdo

571
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:37,780
it because someone who is getting tons

572
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:39,190
of views is acting that way

573
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,750
you know just honest to god being

574
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:41,740
yourself no matter what that looks like

575
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,360
don't know if you think that you're

576
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:45,130
weird or you're different we've all felt

577
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,780
that way and most people on YouTube

578
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:47,980
actually ran to this as an outlet

579
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:49,270
because they weren't accepted and

580
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:50,860
because they felt weird and because they

581
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:52,210
felt different and then on camera me

582
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:53,500
personally I'm speaking for myself I

583
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:55,270
couldn't believe that so many people

584
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,590
loved me like I could not believe it so

585
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:58,330
many people that wanted to hang out with

586
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:59,530

587
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,670
