00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,419
hi sisters James Charles here and

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,190
welcome back to my youtube channel

3
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:07,379
normally in the beginning of each video

4
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:10,200
I say that I'm very excited but no cap

5
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:11,580
for this video I am too nervous not

6
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,990
excited in this latest pin that is

7
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,460
because we were doing something that is

8
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,870
a little bit triggering to me the past

9
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,730
like few weeks on YouTube I've been

10
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,960
watching a lot of nostalgic content for

11
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,460
some reason I don't know what it is but

12
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,660
like the whole recommendation system has

13
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,160
they given me a lot of things from my

14
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,170
childhood I've been watching poptropica

15
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,510
tutorials for some reason Mario Kart

16
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:29,039
videos tumblr theme coding videos like

17
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,599
everything that I used to do when I was

18
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,890
like 10 years old it's all coming back

19
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:33,660
to me and what are my really good

20
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,579
friends Larry a few days ago uploaded a

21
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,719
video where he went on omegle no hits

22
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:38,550
you don't know I've never been on a

23
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,320
before omegle it's basically a website

24
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:43,260
where you can log on and you can video

25
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,309
chat or text strangers for free and if

26
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,050
you're thinking to yourself well that

27
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:47,309
sounds kind of dangerous you're

28
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,780
absolutely right and I would definitely

29
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:50,579
not recommend doing this um if you see

30
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,469
my coming out video you would know why

31
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:54,480
this is very triggering to me and if you

32
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:56,340
haven't seen that video don't worry

33
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,930
about it nothing said for today's

34
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,820
YouTube video I thought I would log on

35
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:02,160
back to amigo for the first time in like

36
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,049
10 years and I would ask strangers to

37
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,159
pick my makeup routine I truly have no

38
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:06,659
idea who we're about to meet on this

39
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:08,250
website today from what I remember a few

40
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:10,439
years ago it was either our musicians

41
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,880
playing their songs or other tumblr kids

42
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:13,020
that all have the same muffle emo

43
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,210
haircut as I did

44
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,759
or like Autobots or a lot of really

45
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:20,100
nasty old naked men so for the sake of

46
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,840
both my eyes and yours I am sincerely

47
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,250
praying that we will meet a whole lot of

48
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,140
sisters that are able to help me pick my

49
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:28,920
makeup routine but without further ado

50
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:32,090

70
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:47,790

really appreciate it

189
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:42,890
joy you're naive yeah oh you guys so

190
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,900
according to Madeline and Sophia we're

191
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:47,030
gonna grab the morphe 8l palette as well

192
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:48,980
if the morphe emma 405 brush and we're

193
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:50,660
gonna dip into the shade of donut and

194
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:52,040
use this to add some dimension at back

195
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:53,030
my face I don't even know why I didn't

196
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,230
think about this but literally in the

197
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:55,640
beginning of this video I mentioned how

198
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:57,260
so many people on this website either

199
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:00,140
have fake cameras to either like

200
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:02,660
advertise nasty websites or like literal

201
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:03,740
catfish video so I didn't think of the

202
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,510
fact that people would probably think

203
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:07,250
that I was fake while being on here that

204
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:08,900
is so funny that not only literally

205
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:10,790
thought I was recording but obviously I

206
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,600
am real I'm not being said it assigned

207
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,650

guys someone's Hannah and Sarah had a

233
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:11,630
really cute idea of having me do a

234
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:13,700
makeup look inspired by somebody that I

235
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:15,410
look up to now to people that I love the

236
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,070
absolute most and they have afraid me to

237
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:18,440
be Who I am today

238
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:19,970
or my mama and my father sister Christy

239
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:25,420
and skip because I met them many times

240
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:27,200
in YouTube videos and on drunk stars I

241
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:29,330
thought it'd be really cute to me we'd

242
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,460
do a look inspired by them with a be my

243
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:33,350
mom shade and skip might oops

244
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:35,120
and skip my dad shade which now has a

245
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:36,830
large gouge in it this will be a cute

246
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,000
little lemonade look so let's see what

247
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:38,690
we can come up with a few months ago on

248
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,740
my end

249
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:41,330
right after I finished watching at

250
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:42,590
euphoria and amazing show by the way

251
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,790
can't wait for season two I did a look

252
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:45,170
inspired by luck said to me and

253
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:47,570
like this beautiful pink and yellow

254
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:50,420
sunset look and I think that I probably

255
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:52,730
should recreate something similar so I'm

256
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:55,220
going to grab the first a pencil brush

257
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:56,840
and just dipping into a little bit of B

258
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,670
and I'm gonna pop this right in my inner

259
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,320
corner and now for the outer corner I'm

260
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:01,910
gonna grab a Tama four five six brush

261
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,400
and dip into it a little bit of love

262
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:05,780
that which is the darker pink shade and

263
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,550
I'm gonna start shaping up my outer V

264
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:09,740
and then with the M 4-3-3 I'm just gonna

265
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:11,300
dip into skip and use this to buff out

266
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:13,160
the edges okay it's gonna start talking

267
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:14,270
that underneath the eye as well maybe

268
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,130
should I grab a little bit of literally

269
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:20,860

something a little bit more fun and then

365
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,570
a classic nude and this will be perfect

366
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,100
with this look

367
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:33,240

368
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,580

369
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:37,500
setting spray from morphe and that is

370
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:39,990
this look selected completely by

371
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:42,150
strangers on omegle a hug completes

372
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:43,500

00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:45,480
was going to turn out today it could

374
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:47,010
have ended a very very poorly but I feel

375
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,660
like the people of omegle came together

376
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:50,940
and honestly created a masterpiece

377
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:52,110
because this look is so cute I do want

378
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,430
to say Ranger thank you to every single
