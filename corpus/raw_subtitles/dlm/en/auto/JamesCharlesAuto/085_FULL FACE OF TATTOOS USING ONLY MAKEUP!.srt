pumpkin I've seen a lot of people on

30
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,899
YouTube but recreate their Punk edits in

31
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,820
real life by like dyeing their hair

32
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:05,220
getting fake piercings and of course

33
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,850
press on like water tattoos but for

34
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,860
today's video

35
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:09,210
my job is obviously a makeup artist so

36
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:16,290
I'm gonna be recreating my punk edits

37
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:17,939
with makeup one feature I see all the

38
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:20,040
time in Punk edits is the cat scratch

39
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:21,689
eyebrow I've worked way too hard on

40
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,250
these have tweeze them to death to get

41
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:25,049
the perfect shape so I'm definitely not

42
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,549
shaving to scratches in my eyebrows

43
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:28,470
today so I'm gonna start off with my

44
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:31,500
Elmer's washable glue stick and glue

45
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:33,000
down just the second half of my brow you

46
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,259
guys see me do this a million times now

47
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,220
in different drag video so if you really

48
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:36,689
want to know how to glue down your

49
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,579
eyebrows definitely check one of those

50
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:40,170
videos I'll link them somewhere up here

51
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:42,990
on the screen so you can get a more

52
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,220
in-depth tutorial once that brow is all

53
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:45,479
glued down and dried I'm just gonna take

54
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:49,290
a powder puff and some translucent

55
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:51,600
powder and pack it there to really lock

56
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:52,259
those hairs in place so we can cover

57
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,540
over them

58
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:58,259
I'm gonna use my Kryolan TV paint stick

59
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:01,180
in the shade and be to cover over those

60
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:04,090
hairs oh my

61
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:05,290
no house a good route cover whoa and

62
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,160
then just applying a really light layer

63
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,690
of the Too Faced Born This Way

64
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,850
Foundation all over the rest of my face

65
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:11,680
not really for like a glam look just for

66
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:13,210
like kind of more even a skin tone all

67
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,530
throughout when it comes to the neck I

68
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:16,540
am actually gonna grab a lot more

69
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:17,950
foundation than the face and really make

70
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:19,870
sure to blend that in and pocket kind of

71
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:22,510
all over because we're gonna be putting

72
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:25,060
a lot of tattoos here and this we do

73
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:26,830
really want a full covered even skin

74
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:29,230
tone so we have a good base for all the

75
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:30,580
drawings I'm gonna go ahead and do the

76
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:32,200
rest my base off camera today just to

77
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:34,000
save some time like I said we are not

78
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,380
going full glam just adding a little bit

79
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,270
of dimension back to my face just make

80
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:40,360
everything kind of more even edit ready

81
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:41,440
for a tattoo for my eyebrows today we're

82
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,850
gonna start off by filling in the base

83
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:48,820
and mica brow gel from Benefit and

84
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:50,230
number four so how basically my brow

85
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,580
shape all sketched out and like I said I

86
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:53,050
was gonna make them really really close

87
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:55,690
to my normal brows I just didn't want to

88
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:57,400
obviously shape a scratch in them so I'm

89
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:58,870
gonna take my shape tape concealer on

90
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,180
just the back of my hand and a tiny

91
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:08,470
liner brush and I'm gonna sketch out my

92
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:10,300
cats Raj this is definitely like an

93
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:12,820
interesting look not really sure how I

94
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:16,239
feel about it so far Wow

95
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:17,950
Grayson Dolan is shaking so one thing I

96
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,870
see all the time in Punk edits and like

97
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:22,660
face tattoos is a lot of people get

98
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:24,070
tears right here and I think that means

99
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,660
the amount of people that you've killed

100
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:27,220
I mean for me personally I don't know

101
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:30,010
about any of you guys but killing people

102
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:31,630
is exactly on my 2018 agenda so instead

103
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:34,460
of putting a tear right here I'm gonna

104
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:37,350
put the adidas logo please sponsor me

105
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:39,580
[Music]

106
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:42,989
this is already turning out to be so

107
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,989
much harder than I expected oh my god

108
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,860
okay so another trend I see all the time

109
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:49,930
in face tattoos is a big word and

110
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:51,160
cursive right above this eyebrow

111
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,840
obviously reading from left to right so

112
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,550
this might be like mirrored on the

113
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,480
camera you're just had to trust me here

114
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:57,400
I don't really know how this is gonna

115
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,290
work or turn out we're just going with

116
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,180
the flow but since this is like right

117
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:02,769
near my brain I'm gonna put the word

118
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:10,150
sisters because you guys are always on

119
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:14,200
my mind that was so cheesy oh it is

120
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:18,250
gonna be backwards you're kidding

121
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:21,480
I can always flip the footage I don't

122
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:21,480
know why so myself up to do this

123
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,910
so obviously this side of my face is a

124
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:30,200
little bit intense right now we

125
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:32,270
definitely need to balance that out on

126
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,730
this side so since we've been using my

127
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:36,110
Kat Von D tattoo liner I figured I would

128
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:39,050
add some stars to this sided honor of

129
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:43,360
Kat Von D but using an X liquid liner I

130
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:43,360
[Music]

131
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:49,220
know that milk makeup literally makes a

132
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:51,800
like star eyeliner stamp that I could

133
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:53,690
just be putting right all over my face

134
00:04:51,800 --> 00:05:02,900
right now but of course I did not have

135
00:04:53,690 --> 00:05:04,370
that or do i nope I don't one person

136
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,830
that was iconic for their face tattoos

137
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:08,840
is lil peep rest in peace he's gone away

138
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:11,360
too soon not only was he an amazing

139
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,040
musician but he was also an openly LGBTQ

140
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,470
person in the rock community which was

141
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:17,390
so amazing so in honor of him I'm gonna

142
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:18,440
recreate some of his face tattoos he had

143
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,970
a horseshoe right in between his

144
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,380
eyebrows for a good luck and since his

145
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:26,000
new year is starting and we had quite a

146
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:27,320
rough last one we're gonna need it he

147
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,210
also had a broken heart tattoo right

148
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:31,130
here on his cheek and I'm gonna recreate

149
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:32,840
that today because lord knows I'd had my

150
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:40,280
heart broken by a far too many stray

151
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:41,810
bullets and a lot of punk edits people

152
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,280
usually edit their ears to be Pierce or

153
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:45,290
like a gauge in their ear with a really

154
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,880
really big earring obviously my ears are

155
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:55,210
not even pierced so I'm gonna draw one

156
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:57,170
huntin eye using some more eyeliner oh I

157
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:58,550
feel like at this point my face is that

158
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:01,520
pretty much done and honestly I'm not

159
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:03,320
even gonna lie I kind of like how this

160
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,240
looks I really thought I was gonna be so

161
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,620
spooked by myself but I really don't

162
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,050
even mind this like a punk

163
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:10,910
sister and chains inversion anyway I'm

164
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:12,350
gonna go to move on to my neck one

165
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,760
tattoo that I see all the time on bill

166
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:15,350
people that are covered in tattoos or

167
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:17,810
they may even just have one or two are

168
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:19,340
Roman and numerals most people tend to

169
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,930
get a really significant date tattooed

170
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:22,910
on them such as like the death of a

171
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:24,710
really close relative or the birth of a

172
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:26,540
child or an anniversary date but for me

173
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:29,969
I have none of those things so I'm gonna

174
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:31,250
do my birthday I love myself

175
00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:34,810
you

176
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:37,550
[Music]

177
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:39,139
there we go May 23rd don't forget to

178
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:40,699
wish me a happy birthday

179
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:42,860
another tattoo that I see all the time

180
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:44,479
on different people is a rose this is

181
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,590
gonna be really really challenging and

182
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,680
I'm kind of already regretting this but

183
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:50,730
I'm gonna try to place a rose right up

184
00:06:48,680 --> 00:07:00,059
in here wish me luck

185
00:06:50,730 --> 00:07:00,059
[Music]

186
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,610
this was literally the one of the worst

187
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:09,270
cities I think I've ever had once I have

188
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:11,230
the rough and I do mean very very rough

189
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:13,450
outline of the roads I'm gonna grab my

190
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:15,640
morphe e39 brushes just this very very

191
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:17,020
very tiny little brush and dip it to

192
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:28,210
some black eyeshadow and try to shade

193
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:29,620
the Rose a little bit honestly not bad

194
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:31,630
another thing that I saw a lot of these

195
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,800
edits were a butterflies butterflies are

196
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:34,420
super intricate and usually their

197
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,920
patterns are very very symmetrical and

198
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,330
beautiful so I'm gonna put this one a

199
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,890
smack dab right in the middle of my

200
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:40,630
throat so I can actually see it in the

201
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:53,800
freaking mirror and we can hope they

202
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:55,360
make it really really good okay honestly

203
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,730
not even gonna lie that butterfly turned

204
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,890
out a lot better than I was expecting

205
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:01,630
kind of living for this I think the last

206
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:03,190
like big major tattoo I'm gonna do is

207
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:07,290
gonna be right over here I'm gonna put a

208
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:10,750
crown there because I'm the queen of

209
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:12,919
[Music]

210
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:14,750
drawing on besides my neck is literally

211
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:16,699
so hard I can't even begin to explain to

212
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,479
you guys how much pain my eyes are in

213
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:19,759
right now I feel like they're about to

214
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:20,840
pop out of their freaking sockets they

215
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,230
should not be looking all the way over

216
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:32,559
here but we're gonna make this work

217
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:32,559
[Music]

218
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:37,120
alright guys those are all the big

219
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:38,500
tattoos finished my eyes currently feel

220
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,490
like they're going to burst out of my

221
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,169
head so I'm gonna take a quick little

222
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:42,729
break then I'm gonna come back and do

223
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:44,529
some tinier ones just in between to kind

224
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:46,630
of fill the space off-camera and I'll be

225
00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:49,390
right back with the finished Punk at it

226
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:51,160
in real life with makeup look all right

227
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:52,540
sisters I am back it has been about two

228
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:55,390
hours now meeting I've been working on

229
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:56,980
this for literally four hours but I

230
00:08:55,390 --> 00:09:09,220
think we are finally done with the

231
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:10,600
finish line before we actually did

232
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:12,339
makeup I used to draw all the time when

233
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,050
I was honestly really really good at it

234
00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:15,370
I used to practice every single day and

235
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:16,870
I would draw portraits and all sorts of

236
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:18,790
intricate really beautifully shaded

237
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:20,110
drawings so going into this I really

238
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,370
didn't think this is gonna be that much

239
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:24,700
of a challenge for me in particular

240
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:26,290
point was I wrong though hence now this

241
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,060
is probably the hardest makeup challenge

242
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:29,230
I have done today I've talked about this

243
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:31,029
in a few videos before but I don't

244
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:32,649
exactly have the most steady hands I

245
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:33,850
usually will start shaking if I get

246
00:09:32,649 --> 00:09:35,290
really really nervous or if I'm trying

247
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:37,720
to work on something very very detailed

248
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:39,790
and intricate so this was a major major

249
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,810
challenge for me I think by far the

250
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:42,579
hardest part of this entire challenge

251
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:44,110
was this rose tattoo even if I was

252
00:09:42,579 --> 00:09:45,490
drawing a rose on normal paper I think I

253
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:46,870
would definitely have some trouble just

254
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:48,520
because the shape and overall form of

255
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:51,430
Rose is very very hard to capture on a

256
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:52,990
2d flat surface but it was even more

257
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:55,089
difficult because it's on the side of my

258
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:57,310
neck where I have to literally like turn

259
00:09:55,089 --> 00:09:59,410
my eye all the way over here to even get

260
00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:01,480
a decent glimpse at this area and I

261
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:03,760
still can barely even see what I'm doing

262
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:06,040
my eyes literally were in so much pain

263
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:09,579
by the end of it but I think it turned

264
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:11,410
out descent I already loved and

265
00:10:09,579 --> 00:10:13,149
respected tattoo artists before I used

266
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:14,230
to watch tattoo videos all the time on

267
00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:15,760
YouTube and would always want to go with

268
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:17,380
my friends when they got them done just

269
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,480
to see the artist in progress but I

270
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:21,970
respect them even more now after trying

271
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,829
it myself because this is so hard

272
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:25,180
alright sisters and that is all I have

273
00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:27,760
