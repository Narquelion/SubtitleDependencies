00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,780
hi sisters James Charles here and

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:05,339
welcome back to my youtube channel for

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,379
today's video I have something not gonna

4
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:09,210
lie a little bit less like implant I had

5
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:11,820
a concept for today's video all ready to

6
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:13,950
go ready to film I sat down and after a

7
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,230
further thought quickly realized it was

8
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,279
not the best idea since I'm an awful

9
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,340
youtuber and could not think of any

10
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,960
better ideas I'm gonna be reading this

11
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,789
makeup book that I did almost two years

12
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,900
ago now to date it is still when my

13
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:26,699
all-time favorite makeup books that I've

14
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,560
ever done but I feel like my skill level

15
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:29,640
has grown so much and I think I could

16
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,650
really improve this and make this a

17
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,690
really really awesome look not only mine

18
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,520
awful youtuber but I'm also unoriginal

19
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,930
and since last week's video was

20
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,059
recreating your guys's makeup looks and

21
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:40,649
today's videos recreate mine I can't use

22
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:42,899
recreating and my title twice in a row

23
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:45,210
that'll be really really stupid so I'm

24
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:47,039
gonna make this video also a Q&A so I

25
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,620
can make the tomato something different

26
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,670
love that I've always been K I've been

27
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,010
wanting to recreate this look for a

28
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,270
super super long time now but creative

29
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,520
looks don't really do that well on my

30
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,930
channel so this is the perfect excuse

31
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,739
for me to do a creative makeup look and

32
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:02,789
you guys have to watch got you good

33
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:04,350
without further ado I already have my

34
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:05,970
base already on let's go ahead and get

35
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:12,869
started with some questions and some

36
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:14,520
cool lightning bolt makeups I'm gonna

37
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:16,320
start this book off by popping off my

38
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,630
eyelashes clearly I'm going to be doing

39
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,670
a lot of work on my face and eyes today

40
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:22,680
so cannot have any of Miami's

41
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:25,590
distracting me from that process oh my

42
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,210
god I just lost that no we're gonna be

43
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,590
founder so shut off this lips today I'm

44
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,240
gonna lay down just a light base coat

45
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,799
using my morphe at 35 P palette and

46
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,840
using the blue shade or right in this

47
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,900
corner the first question today comes

48
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,450
from sister Alessandra and she says

49
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:40,979
pineapple on pizza yes or no absolutely

50
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:42,829
not I literally think pineapple pizza is

51
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:45,899
one of the grossest

52
00:01:42,829 --> 00:01:48,000
combinations ever like who wants their

53
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:50,070
pizza to be sweet I know I certainly

54
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,409
know I personally am a pepperoni type

55
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:55,409
sister I love me some good pepperoni

56
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:56,670
pineapple absolutely not I'm your ask do

57
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:58,560
you want to stay in LA or do you plan to

58
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,610
move somewhere else in the future that's

59
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,799
actually a really good question that I

60
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:03,390
personally ask myself all the time

61
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,280
thinking in terms of right now I

62
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,860
definitely do plan on staying in LA for

63
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,330
quite a long time I really really like

64
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,039
it here I definitely like love the Sun

65
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,150
the warm weather all my really close

66
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,920
friends are here aside from my

67
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,569
family of course so I really like being

68
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,560
here and my job is here as well I feel

69
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:19,920
like I'm always getting a lot of work

70
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,450
done as for downtown LA definitely not

71
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,829
I plan on renewing my lease here for one

72
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,209
more year but after this year I'm gonna

73
00:02:22,829 --> 00:02:25,680
save all my money and hopefully be able

74
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:27,480
to build my own house which is gonna be

75
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,280
such an amazing accomplishment at only

76
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,239
19 years old so fingers crossed that

77
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,530
that works out because that is something

78
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,450
that I'm really really looking forward

79
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:35,069
to but I guess I really never know what

80
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:36,659
the future holds like I said for right

81
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:38,430
now I'm happy but I definitely want to

82
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:40,439
explore a whole lot more and kind of see

83
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:43,260
my options and who knows where I'll be

84
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:45,720
five ten years from now so right now I'm

85
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,129
happy as a Nellie sister but maybe I'm

86
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,620
being and I don't recall one day

87
00:02:47,129 --> 00:02:51,510

88
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,489

91
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:03,239
question sister right I don't know well

92
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:05,310
I can't believe my nose contour looked

93
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:06,689
so good today and Here I am packing dark

94
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:11,430
blue eyeshadow right over top of it and

95
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:12,290
ruining all the hard work I don't know

96
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:14,340
what I was gonna say that

97
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:15,720
katelyn ass if you gotta marry the last

98
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:25,169
person that you kissed how would you

99
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:27,680
feel who died Oh awful oh no actually I

100
00:03:25,169 --> 00:03:30,120
think I feel pretty good about that one

101
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,799
yeah I think I'd be okay with that

102
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,810
actually on second thought wrong person

103
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:38,730
sister Julia oz explain your love life

104
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:40,470
in one word intense my ass if you could

105
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,180
tell your younger self one thing what

106
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:44,129
would it be

107
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:45,599
shut up I really love this natural

108
00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:45,900
everyday glam look that we have going on

109
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,199
right now

110
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:51,989
ah Briana asked who was telling that you

111
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:53,579
look up to I think that my answer would

112
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:55,829
actually be to people and that would be

113
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:57,209
Jacqueline Hale and nikkietutorials I

114
00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:59,069
remember watching joseline Halen wanting

115
00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:00,329
to literally buy every single product

116
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:01,859
she ever put on her face because she

117
00:04:00,329 --> 00:04:03,120
looked at that perfect and I were

118
00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:05,729
watching Nicki and it's just really

119
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,260
bringing my true artist out in me I feel

120
00:04:05,729 --> 00:04:08,699
like her looks were always so original

121
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,049
and so creative and I just really love

122
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:11,190
that about YouTube because do you guys

123
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:12,690
know that's really what got my start in

124
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:13,919
the makeup industry to begin with so I

125
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:15,150
really had to say Jacqueline her nathie

126
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:16,799
because they've been around for so long

127
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:18,299
and I think have generally worked so

128
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,159
hard for the platforms that they have

129
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:22,169
and truly do deserve it and use their

130
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:23,380
platforms for the best they possibly can

131
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:24,640
which makes me it really really hot

132
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:27,520
and makes me happy to call them role

133
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,630
models and also really close friends I'm

134
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,920
just gonna take the darker blue shade

135
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,940
and the darker blush lead to kind of

136
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,070
create some clouds and some more

137
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:35,530
dimension in the sky

138
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:36,940
I guess hello Sam asks if you could

139
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:39,190
change one thing about yourself what

140
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:41,950
would it be and why and I'd probably

141
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:43,330
have to say my hairline that's always

142
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:45,220
the first thing that I change on

143
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:47,650
facetune I wish it was just like a

144
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:50,980
little bit lower because sister always

145
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:52,270
has a lot on his mind he asked if you

146
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:54,250
could know one thing about your future

147
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:57,490
right now what would it be and why

148
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:58,960
good question probably what social media

149
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:01,170
point that I leave Thursday comments on

150
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,700
is finally gonna give in and marry me

151
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:05,020
yeah Kaitlyn asked if you were stranded

152
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,490
on a deserted island and you could

153
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:09,420
choose one youtuber to be sharing it

154
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:11,770
with you who would you pick and why I

155
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:14,200
think calling back to a few questions

156
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:16,060
ago I have to say it's sister Nikki once

157
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,620
again I feel like we'd be able to put

158
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:19,180
our creative minds together and figure

159
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:21,850
out some way of like living and

160
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:23,080
surviving also she's like super tall so

161
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:27,220
she could probably just reach for all

162
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:30,550
the coconuts in the tree that looks

163
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:32,350
pretty what is going on here hello

164
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:33,910
let me forgot how much I hate it working

165
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:38,040
a blue eyeshadow and look what I'm doing

166
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:38,040
cover my entire face with blue eyeshadow

167
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:43,630
makes me a face tune John asked what do

168
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:46,870
you think about any drama in the beauty

169
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:49,540
community I try not to think about the

170
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:50,740
beauty community Tommy asked what is one

171
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,180
thing you really want to accomplish by

172
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,800
the end of 2018

173
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,450
now in search of this might be a little

174
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,980
bit cliche and it's kind of like a more

175
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:59,170
vague type of situation rather than like

176
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:00,670
once is the next thing but I want

177
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:02,500
everybody at the end of just at 18 to be

178
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:06,070
able to look back on my year including

179
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:07,930
myself and just think oh my god how did

180
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:09,040
he do all of that that is what I want

181
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:10,720
for my year and I know that sounds

182
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,950
really really cliche but I just want to

183
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,600
get so much time to be working all year

new videos like literally everything you

188
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:22,510
can possibly imagine

189
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:24,730
I just want to do it I'm gonna do it all

190
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:26,080
sisters are gonna take over the world

191
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:27,790
Kayla asked if there was gonna be a

192
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,070
movie made about your life who would you

193
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:32,360
want to play you oh this is actually a

194
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:34,069
really really good question

195
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,900
oh you know why I would pick I would

196
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:37,400
pick sister Jake snatched by Jake on

197
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,259
Instagram who runs on my fan page just

198
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,940
he is literally so cute and I feel like

199
00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:42,409
he's literally like that meaning me we

200
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:44,180
look alike and he does makeup so he

201
00:06:42,409 --> 00:06:46,310
would definitely be a good sister James

202
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:47,720
I think I would trust him to play me

203
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:48,289
even though these are pretty big shoes

204
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,819
to fill

205
00:06:48,289 --> 00:06:56,300
Bibby asked what is your biggest fear

206
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:57,979
hmm probably a red socialblade just

207
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:59,599
kidding I am deathly afraid of heights

208
00:06:57,979 --> 00:07:04,879
and snakes

209
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:07,009
oh and bees and dying yeah all those

210
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:15,129
things Adrian said quick first all that

211
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:22,120
comes to mind sing it Oh baby don't say

212
00:07:15,129 --> 00:07:22,120
the Turk with you between my arms

213
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:31,509
barefoot on the grass listening to our

214
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:34,789
favorite song when you said you love

215
00:07:31,509 --> 00:07:37,550
dumbest and cheering sweetie I am so

216
00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:38,569
sorry Stephanie asked what's one piece

217
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,669
of advice you have for someone looking

218
00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:42,740
to start a career in the makeup industry

219
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:44,690
this is a question NTM that I get from

220
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:46,130
you guys literally all the time and I

221
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:48,409
think that the best answer I have for

222
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:50,539
you it would be to do something that

223
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:53,000
nobody else is doing don't do brown

224
00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:54,469
smokey eyes don't do warm half-cut

225
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,550
creases and if you're gonna do those

226
00:07:54,469 --> 00:07:57,710
favorite looks and that's what you love

227
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:59,330
that's fine but just find some way to

228
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:01,250
make your own put your own spin on it

229
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:02,449
make videos with your personalities

230
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,529
shining through it just do something

231
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:05,240
that's gonna set yourself apart because

232
00:08:03,529 --> 00:08:07,190
there's a million one people trying to

233
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,300
do the same exact thing and nobody's

234
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:10,879
gonna make it with the same definitely

235
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:19,300
all seen a million times trust me on

236
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:19,300
that it looks like I can barely breathe

237
00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:24,650
Christina asked if you could design your

238
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,840
own escape room what would the theme be

239
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:28,099
and how intense would you make it if you

240
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,319
guys are part of the sister a snapchat

241
00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:32,360
fan which if you are not go add me right

242
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,190
up here and as a lent time there all

243
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,529
sorts of rants fun activities singing

244
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:37,760
and of course sister escape rooms you

245
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:39,380
guys know I do them all the time it is

246
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,180
literally my favorite pastime in the

247
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:44,900
entire world like if I find an escape

248
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:47,240
room one day that kills me I'll be dying

249
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,710
very happy as crazy as that sounds but I

250
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,230
do think about this quite often as

251
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:52,580
bursting as that may seem one thing that

252
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:54,620
I would love to see in an escape from

253
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:56,660
would be like a log cabin type of

254
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,920
situation like in the snowy hills or

255
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,600
something and you only have an hour to

256
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,790
escape or else like the abominable

257
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,960
snowman or something comes to get you we

258
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:06,050
can work on that part of the concept

259
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,890
have really thoughtfully through but you

260
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:08,540
guys know I definitely have a really

261
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:09,620
really intense once I think it'd be so

262
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:11,600
cool to have all different sorts of

263
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:13,640
rooms but I think the one really cool

264
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,680
aspect of it sense would be in the snow

265
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:18,110
would be really cool if the room got

266
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,640
colder as the hour progressed and by the

267
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:21,530
time like the last few minutes are going

268
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,940
and be like freezing cold I don't think

269
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:24,440
that'd be such a cool out of concept to

270
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:26,360
add it to the already challenging escape

271
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,950
room let me know what you guys think if

272
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,310
you were to design an escape room what

273
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:32,960
would it be

274
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:36,980
leave a comment down below am i bleeding

275
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:38,300
oh that's a mole I'm gonna try to bring

276
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,740
up some of the darkness and his I up to

277
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,120
the contouring areas and kind of connect

278
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:44,300
and blend them together to distract from

279
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:48,410
the poor blending going on in this

280
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:51,400
region oh that's so pretty

281
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:54,410
Alex asked Coke or Pepsi Pepsi

282
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:55,970
hands-down Pepsi is so much better even

283
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:58,970
though they've had quite the problematic

284
00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:00,440
past so by let me tell you nothing makes

285
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:01,940
me happier in the entire world than when

286
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,920
I am at a restaurant and someone says

287
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:04,880
nobody wants a drink and I'm like oh I

288
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,440
want a coke

289
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,060
I let me say coke is still really good -

290
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,380
at at this point it served at most

291
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,820
locations so I just gotten used to

292
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:12,860
saying coke but nothing makes me happier

293
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:15,589
than when someone says always Pepsi ok

294
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:17,870
yes girl yes

295
00:10:15,589 --> 00:10:21,440
Pepsi is more than okay god bless you

296
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:23,060
thank you so much for that if you like

297
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,280
coke that is okay if you like Pepsi

298
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:27,050
that's okay as long as you acknowledge

299
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,339
that there is a difference between them

300
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:31,250
because if you think that they are the

301
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:33,890
same thing we have a problem Anna said

302
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:37,070
who was one non beauty youtuber that you

303
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:38,390
would really love to collab with this

304
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,860
question I think is really really easy I

305
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:42,350
think my answer hands down would either

306
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:44,270
be Shane Dawson or jenna Marbles their

307
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:46,100
content is so funny and they both been

308
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:47,930
around for so long but continue to make

309
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,370
me laugh every single time they upload a

310
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:51,110
video I just like they are so creative

311
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:53,120
and just really like killing the game

312
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:54,920
I've looked up to them forever I've met

313
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,660
both of them so

314
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,879
yeah definitely love to do a video with

315
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:00,589
all of them Kay asked when we get more

316
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:02,660
of the sisters merge I really want to

317
00:11:00,589 --> 00:11:04,129
get the sisters Barbour talking uh yeah

318
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,989
yeah thank you k for always supporting

319
00:11:04,129 --> 00:11:07,189
that means of the world to me I've

320
00:11:05,989 --> 00:11:08,359
actually been getting a lot of questions

321
00:11:07,189 --> 00:11:09,379
about system paralleled in the past a

322
00:11:08,359 --> 00:11:11,869
few days and for those of you guys who

323
00:11:09,379 --> 00:11:14,299
haven't noticed don't really know why

324
00:11:11,869 --> 00:11:15,949
you would this is to prepare website

325
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:17,389
husband down for the past few weeks this

326
00:11:15,949 --> 00:11:19,519
is apparel was a first-ever polling line

327
00:11:17,389 --> 00:11:21,319
that I've done obviously I have no

328
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,730
experience in that field whatsoever and

329
00:11:21,319 --> 00:11:24,549
I will be open and honest and saying

330
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:26,329
that it was definitely not the smoothest

331
00:11:24,549 --> 00:11:27,980
processes there were definitely a lot of

332
00:11:26,329 --> 00:11:29,359
problems when I came to like production

333
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:31,549
and shipping and obviously that's not

334
00:11:29,359 --> 00:11:32,929
something I want to put my name on to so

335
00:11:31,549 --> 00:11:34,040
we just ended the process of switching

336
00:11:32,929 --> 00:11:35,389
companies and just making sure our

337
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:37,639
production techniques are the best they

338
00:11:35,389 --> 00:11:39,679
can possibly be in order to get you guys

339
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:41,809
looking at the cutest you possibly can

340
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:43,249
way way smoother Jen said if for some

341
00:11:41,809 --> 00:11:45,169
reason you couldn't do makeup anymore

342
00:11:43,249 --> 00:11:46,519
what career would you choose oh and

343
00:11:45,169 --> 00:11:48,290
since I know you'd probably say singer

344
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:51,529
you can't choose that either I mean like

345
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:53,629
normal nine to five job damn she got me

346
00:11:51,529 --> 00:11:56,209
there I feel like if I wasn't able to do

347
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:58,069
makeup or sing I probably doing

348
00:11:56,209 --> 00:12:00,230
something involving like numbers and

349
00:11:58,069 --> 00:12:01,939
technology in high school my favorite

350
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:03,679
subject was actually math which I feel

351
00:12:01,939 --> 00:12:05,299
like it's like breaking the internet kid

352
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:06,949
law because I feel like every social

353
00:12:05,299 --> 00:12:08,600
media influencers like I hate math I was

354
00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:10,220
so bad at it but I really could probably

355
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,410
be in accounting because that mixes

356
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:16,429
together like numbers and technology and

357
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:17,839
math and money which I love or also

358
00:12:16,429 --> 00:12:19,759
stocks because that combines all those

359
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,569
things at plus strategy which you guys

360
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:22,189
know that I love

361
00:12:20,569 --> 00:12:23,569
probably socks I feel like that'd be fun

362
00:12:22,189 --> 00:12:28,160
Phoenix are us will this be the last

363
00:12:23,569 --> 00:12:29,629
question of the video yes we're done our

364
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,720
sisters and that is this lightning a

365
00:12:29,629 --> 00:12:33,799
recreation look a complete I am so happy

366
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,899
to have this turned on I just feel like

367
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:37,879
it looks so electric and bright and

368
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:40,789
beautiful comparing this one to the

369
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:42,860
original look this one is way way way

370
00:12:40,789 --> 00:12:44,839
better like I said the original photo

371
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:46,789
was posted in 2016 it's one of the first

372
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:47,989
looks that I ever did it was right at

373
00:12:46,789 --> 00:12:49,549
the beginning of my makeup career and

374
00:12:47,989 --> 00:12:51,169
you could definitely see how much my

375
00:12:49,549 --> 00:12:52,759
skills have improved since then

376
00:12:51,169 --> 00:12:54,919
obviously they are very very similar

377
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:57,859
concepts but the contours are definitely

378
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:59,779
intensified a lot more oh thank god

379
00:12:57,859 --> 00:13:01,579
there's a lot more dimension a lot more

380
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:03,110
glow a lot more highlights and I'd like

381
00:13:01,579 --> 00:13:04,489
my line work is just a lot cleaner we

382
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:06,439
added an eye shadow look we have some

383
00:13:04,489 --> 00:13:07,070

384
00:13:06,439 --> 00:13:08,330
