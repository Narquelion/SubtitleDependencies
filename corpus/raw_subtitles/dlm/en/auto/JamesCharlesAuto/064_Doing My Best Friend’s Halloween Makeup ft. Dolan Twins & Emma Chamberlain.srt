fourteen hours a day in the Halloween

23
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,950

25
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,490
sister secret if you pay close attention

27
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,610
in this yeah this how much one's the

28
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:34,740
trick and which ones that show you

29
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:36,810
that's a tree turn me into a pumpkin so

30
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,670
you wanna your pumpkin - bet yeah I do

31
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,170
never really been a pumpkin before so we

32
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,320
figured it'll be fine and good and funky

33
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,189
and fresh - all do like half face

34
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,390
tutorials mostly guys are gonna be here

35
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:47,340
for 12 hours and I don't want to do a

36
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:57,270
whole place I'm a commander Freddy but

37
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:58,469
he's almost cooler doing so Facebook as

38
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:00,030
well we're picking one way to like

39
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:02,189
incorporate the real face into the half

40
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:04,170
a story then we figured it'd be fun to

41
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:06,390
do my sister's stapler first this

42
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:08,250
awesome sister staples is scarce it's

43
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,410
just tables so not fit me so special

44
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,300
attacks that I don't know how to do but

45
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:14,819
we're gonna figure it out together

46
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,410
you just staple gun my face true so I

47
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:17,730
continue to use this stuff this is nose

48
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:22,430
and scar wax so it's basically like

49
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:22,430
moldable skin a second along the line

50
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:43,200
good I think I'm just gonna like make a

51
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,000
big worm yeah and then you put the

52
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,980
staples in it Japanese spooky ghost

53
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,959
stories do I actually really do do you

54
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,620
yeah apparently like I saw a ghost when

55
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,720
I was a baby

56
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,879
what so my dad told me and he doesn't

57
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,530
believe in ghosts at all like my dad has

58
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:56,670

60
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:00,870

00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:19,440
plastic cap and I'm going to use this to

122
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:21,810
go over top of the scar wax to lock it

123
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,770
in place and to like blend the edges and

124
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:24,090

00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:28,680
edges with the liquid latex and I'm

129
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,210

black shadow time for mouth time yeah I

196
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:40,700

really happy with how this turned out I

201
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:51,110
was really nervous at first low-key not

202
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,940
even why but it came together so we do

203
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:54,529
have a few of my steps for the finishing

204
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,790
touches and one of those is going to be

205
00:08:54,529 --> 00:08:57,529
obviously Ethan had them it's hard gosh

206
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:59,330
through his face we need to add some

207
00:08:57,529 --> 00:09:01,430
special effects and some spooky a sister

208
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:16,070

468
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:11,970
endearing to see James actually like

469
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:14,250
exhausted by something because like I've

470

like I don't know

570
00:24:53,789 --> 00:25:03,269
I just want to give a warning to you

571
00:25:01,649 --> 00:25:06,090
what you're doing your Halloween makeup

572
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:09,509
this year do not attempt more than three

573
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:11,549
looks because I say don't do more than

574
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:22,950
one we had to make a disclaimer come on

575
00:25:11,549 --> 00:25:24,359
G so I've hurt my back and forth between

576
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:25,649
many different ideas that is had what

577
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:28,559
look I wanted to do I ultimately decided

578
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:29,759
that I have no ideas so I'm going to be

579
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:32,399
recreating the look that I did on the

580
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:34,619
twins last year what was a werewolf

581
00:25:32,399 --> 00:25:36,029
makeup and I did this in literally 30

582
00:25:34,619 --> 00:25:38,279
minutes east so it was very very rushed

583
00:25:36,029 --> 00:25:39,899
and very fast but ended up looking at a

584
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:41,309
really really dope actually and so many

585
00:25:39,899 --> 00:25:43,049
of you guys requested a tutorial that

586
00:25:41,309 --> 00:25:43,919
was my first time actually ever meeting

587
00:25:43,049 --> 00:25:44,999
the twins

588
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,009
I am very annoying to them right now

589
00:25:44,999 --> 00:25:49,229
because this day has been a nightmare

590
00:25:47,009 --> 00:25:51,330
but I am so blessed to have them in my

591
00:25:49,229 --> 00:25:53,220
life seriously it's been an amazing year

592
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:54,330
and I cannot wait for many more together

593
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,619
I feel like it's just gonna be like a

594
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:56,989
combination of lots of different like

595
00:25:55,619 --> 00:26:00,989
strokes

596
00:25:56,989 --> 00:26:04,200
grab some black really put that in there

597
00:26:00,989 --> 00:26:07,259
start some fur what IV hot with a beard

598
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:14,039
T basically I think I put block like all

599
00:26:07,259 --> 00:26:16,080
the way around the face okay and the

600
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:18,570
brow makeup nice and bushy good

601
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:21,749
reminiscence of James Charles at 2016

602
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:23,820
blaack eyebrows we love her gonna throw

603
00:26:21,749 --> 00:26:25,649
some Brown in the mix let's see what she

604
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:27,779
has to bring to the table I'm gonna buy

605
00:26:25,649 --> 00:26:29,849
some white mix with Greg and like right

606
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:34,499
here a little bit on the cheekbone for a

607
00:26:29,849 --> 00:26:36,960
little werewolf glow okay I think I need

608
00:26:34,499 --> 00:26:38,789
to make the eyeball like blah that's

609
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,159
what I did last year that I just took

610
00:26:38,789 --> 00:26:43,830
this no gonna feather this black liner

611
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:46,890
out as if it's like a little furs things

612
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:50,250
gonna take some little white furs step

613
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:52,559
- perhaps some brow that's looking okay

614
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:54,390
I'm going to pop some white in this

615
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:57,000
little inner corner that I just created

616
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:58,980
to open up the werewolf eye I'm gonna

617
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,470
draw the nose now exercise I have not

618
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:03,150
talked in the Buddy 20 minutes sorry

619
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:05,190
about that so that's pretty much the

620
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:07,260
face makeup all complete am I happy with

621
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:08,880
this debatable and I'm gonna keep moving

622
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,240
absolutely because it is 3:00 in the

623
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,820
morning

624
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:13,710
so what I'm going to do now is add the

625
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:14,880
gash on my neck that I gave the twins

626
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:16,170
last year which I actually think and

627
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,150
really pull the entire look together so

628
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:20,250
who knows maybe this will be a whole lot

629
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:24,840
better what I'm gonna do is more liquid

630
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:26,520
latex or to end this entire area and

631
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,870
then it got me uneven shards of toilet

632
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:31,110
paper we're just going to stick it on

633
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:32,490
there or liquid latex more paper and now

634
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:33,600
I'm gonna let this dry okay I'm just

635
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:35,220
gonna layer over top of this with

636
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:42,720
somewhat foundation to blend it into my

637
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:47,340
natural skin tone the worst thing I've

638
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:50,100
ever done it's gonna cut three good and

639
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:51,179
fresh gashes using the block from the

640
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:53,429
makeup firmer but I'm just going to fill

641
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:55,799
in those three gashes just looks like

642
00:27:53,429 --> 00:27:58,380
they were deep cuts with my thick blood

643
00:27:55,799 --> 00:28:03,380
I'm going to grab a little palette and

644
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:03,380
I'm going to shove this in there hey Don

645
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:16,360
I'm still alive but I'm barely breathing

646
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,360
literally

647
00:28:16,970 --> 00:29:03,599
[Music]

648
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:13,140
it's 4:00 in the morning yeah I'm the

649
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:15,210
itchy as I've ever been all year

650
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:17,520
probably my looks so good

651
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:20,310
I think the liquid uh looking at latex

652
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,900
really like held up I was the last one

653
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:25,050
to get my makeup done before James and

654
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:28,650
mine is still the most ruined Oh what

655
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:31,650
did you do what did you do I don't know

656
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:34,050
I'm crazy with those contacts I'm sorry

657
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:37,620
but I I don't know what I did I just

658
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:39,150
like I look around and I doing a little

659
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:42,420
circle of like foundation I'm like

660
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:43,800
someone's shirt like oh my god that's

661
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:45,060
where it came from with my hoodie we're

662
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,740

these lips came out and even though mine

is very very last second and it's a

671
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:13,800
favorite it was a nice reminiscent of

672
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:15,720
last year's makeup look for one holy

673
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:17,970

way longer it yeah it feels like it's a

675
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:22,100
