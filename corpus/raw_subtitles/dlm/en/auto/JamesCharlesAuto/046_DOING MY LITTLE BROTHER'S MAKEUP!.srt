00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:08,910

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:10,110
welcome back to my youtube channel so as

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,790
you can see once again I have a very

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,170
very special guest joining me here today

5
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:15,690

00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,820

7
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,680
freaking lights on our my little brother

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,660
does eye makeup video it was definitely

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,010
an interesting look to say the least

10
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,109
how did you feel about doing makeup for

11
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,460
the first time it's very difficult in

12
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:28,050
the last video I did make you guys a

13
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,330
promise and I said if we got 50,000

14
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,500
likes I would sit little Ian down once

15
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,450
again and we would do another video

16
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,280
where I did his makeup I think it is

17
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,930
time Ian to get a full glam makeover

18
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,890
because lord knows my look was not too

19
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:42,300
full glam or a quality makeover so we're

20
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,100
gonna give it on Ian today how do you

21
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,110
feel about this I'm not very excited

22
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:51,289
have you ever worn makeup before on my

23
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:53,969
hickeys yeah okay alright so we have our

24
00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:56,789
pink kitty drink ADIZ and we are ready

25
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:58,289
to get glam let's do this so I'm first

26
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:59,760
gonna start by priming it sister Ian

27
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:03,239
Stacy's in the benefit Porefessional

28
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,739
primer so units obviously a teenager he

29
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:06,060
is 15 years old which is one question

30
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,189
that we didn't answer in the last video

31
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,560
so Ian definitely has a teenager skin

32
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:11,880
right now and he does get breakouts

33
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,500
relatively often but that's okay

34
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,850
everybody does so pore freshner is

35
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,650
definitely gonna help to like fill in

36
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,170
his pores and make his skin nice and

37
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,460
smooth so for foundation sonography use

38
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,530
in the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD

39
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,630
foundation stick in the shader why three

40
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,600
six five now you guys know I'm usually

41
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:29,549
between Y 315 and Y 335 eNOS definitely

42
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,740
blessed a little bit more of a tan than

43
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:33,540
I am I had to have a fake one but he is

44
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,009
all natural so we're gonna be using this

45
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,770
one today which is hopefully gonna be a

46
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:39,360
good match and oh boy yeah it looks like

47
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:43,369

53
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:59,940

00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:23,940
not to do any eyeshadow and since I did

113
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:25,080
force him to sit down and do this video

114
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,390
with me and the first place I figured

115
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,770
fine sister I'll honor his wishes so

116
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,280
we're gonna go right on to lashes and

117
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,930

his but he also has super hooded eyelids

121
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:39,150

123
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:44,820
