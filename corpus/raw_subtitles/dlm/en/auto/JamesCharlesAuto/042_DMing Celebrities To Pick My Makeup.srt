00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,540
hi sisters James Charles here and

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:04,920
welcome back to my youtube channel for

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,210
today's video I'm very excited because

4
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,919
we're doing a trend that has been going

5
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:10,110
around honestly quite a lot on YouTube

6
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,490
recently and not is the damming a bunch

7
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,750
of celebrities challenge basically

8
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,250
creators are reaching out to different

9
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,630
celebrities and sending the messages

10
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,150
seeing if the respond or asking

11
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,260
questions or in my case for today asking

12
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,789
them to be a part of my makeup routine

13
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,500
now I just want to give a quick shout

14
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:24,060
out to soft as nails and Sylvia Ghani

15
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,439
because they already did this before me

16
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,060
but I thought it'd be really fun to try

17
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,439
to do it myself and a bunch of different

18
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,939
people who've actually reached out to me

19
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,470
for this challenge which is very very

20
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:33,600
strange but also very very cool at the

21
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:35,610
same time I used to make jokes my

22
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,120
friends about being famous clearly they

23
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:40,950
did not go over too well but for today's

24
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,540
video we're gonna be damming some real

25
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,950
celebrities and seeing if they want to

26
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:50,180
be a part of my makeup routine

27
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:52,260
[Music]

28
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:54,120
alright you guys let's just jump right

29
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,469
into everything I have my Instagram DMS

30
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,329
and open and were just gonna start

31
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:59,250
setting some messages and see what

32
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:00,210
happened so the first step of my makeup

33
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,309
routine is obviously going to be a

34
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,270
primer so I feel like I wanted a I'm at

35
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:05,430
some different celebrities that have a

36
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,840
really really beautiful skin and the

37
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:09,689
first person that comes to mind is Miss

38
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,909
Bella Hadid so I'm going to send her a

39
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:13,409
and Sorrenti M little but I lost and her

40
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:14,790
on July 1st and said did you just hand

41
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:16,290
the plane to we're actually on a flight

42
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,970
Taylor from New York to LA and we were

43
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:20,130
both running late for meetings and we

44
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,689
both did our makeup on the plane

45
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,040
it was low-key kind of iconic I mean

46
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:24,299
obviously how to each other but she did

47
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,380
not see my DM so let's see if she sees

48
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:26,790
this one

49
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,080
so after primer cross foundation and you

50
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:29,820
guys know I definitely love a full

51
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,960
covered and makeup look so I definitely

52
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,810
want to reach out to somebody who like

53
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,250
also is always painted every time so the

54
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:38,340
first one that comes to mind is a sister

55
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:40,650
cardi B her makeup artist Erica is so

56
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,360
freaking talented so I think she'll have

57
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,500
a good one one day she'll send okay the

58
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,329
last person that I want to jam for

59
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,759
foundation is probably like the longest

60
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:50,220
shot from happening in this entire video

61
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,439
but there's a slight chance and that is

62
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:54,299
Queen living legend herself

63
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:55,829
Rihanna because she does not fancy

64
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:59,840
beauty she has her own foundation it's a

65
00:01:55,829 --> 00:02:03,689
really really bomb so lost hi Queen

66
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:07,079
little Queen hope you're doing well I'm

67
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:11,069
so excited for all of the new pieces

68
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:13,560
from the affinity collection do you want

69
00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:16,980
to participate and recommend a

70
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,170
foundation or me it's who use winky face

71
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,580
because she's a businesswoman and I know

72
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:22,050
she'll see this marketing opportunity

73
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,790
other foundation comes concealer so I

74
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,620
shake the perfect person to reach out to

75
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:27,900
for this as Isis terrorists are a Larson

76
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,640
she is so beautiful and yes we did have

77
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,440
a beef beforehand but we've deemed we've

78
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,480
popped it out and now we are good

79
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,590
sisters and I feel like she will come

80
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,209
through it with a good and fresh

81
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:38,129
suggestion let's see if sisters are not

82
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:39,510
replies now after concealer from Mia

83
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:41,640
come setting powder and obviously the

84
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:43,019
whole point of powder is to lock your

85
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,519
face in place so it lasts all day long

86
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:46,200
and when I think a setting powder I

87
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:48,000
definitely think I want to DM at Camp a

88
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,019
trust because she's literally one my

89
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
favorite artist of all time right now

90
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:53,760
and I have seen her alive and she goes

91
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,930
crazy she is so insanely talented and

92
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,580
that means her makeup artist has to

93
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:57,450
really lock her face in please so I feel

94
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,170
like she might have a really good

95
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,790
suggestion

96
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,930
I literally obsessed with her and we've

97
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:02,819
dammed back and forth a few different

98
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,989
times so hopefully she replies next

99
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:05,670
comes a bronzer and contouring that

100
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:08,340
obviously means somebody who is chiseled

101
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:10,140
who was beautiful and in the Sun so I

102
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,560
think we should go ahead and DM Camilla

103
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,260
Kibeho

104
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,760
she's a lime queen it's so crazy because

105
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,260
the first time I ever him back to me

106
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,180
like a pea was outside of an ariana

107
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:20,099
grande concert weirdly enough I was

108
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,390
going in and she was coming out and I

109
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:22,830
was like running and she literally was

110
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:27,690
like oh my god it's not James and I

111
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:29,519
turned around and I was like and it was

112
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:30,750
like the crazies interacted my entire

113
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,250
life because I literally was obsessed

114
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:34,319
with her and her music and her voice and

115
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,879
whole I still remember it like it was

116
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,709
literally yesterday we took a selfie

117
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:39,989
together and I've loved her ever since

118
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:41,879
it is so cool to see her blow up so

119
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:43,590
hopefully she replies and to suggest I

120
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:45,450
bronzer okay you guys so the next intro

121
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,599
routine is going to be blush and I feel

122
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:49,860
like blush is a very like innocent cute

123
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,810
youthful timid makeup product so when I

124
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,580
think of that I think of million Bobby

125
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:55,019
at brown and obviously on stranger

126
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:57,000
things eleven does not work too much

127
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:58,650
makeup but when she walks the red carpet

128
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,239
Millie always looks so beautiful so she

129
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:01,739
might have a great suggestion once I

130
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,060
blush this on I always go ahead and bake

131
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:04,620
but we already have our sister setting

132
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,239
powder so the next that was going to be

133
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,549
our brows and when I think of like

134
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,569
really beautiful structure at brows one

135
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:11,430
of the first people that comes to mind

136
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:12,010
is sister at Madison birra because she

137
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,640
always

138
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:15,440
literally perfect I don't even

139
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,060
understand how one human being can look

140
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,340
like that but she might have a good

141
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:21,049
suggestion sent to Madison beer after

142
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:22,730
eyebrows are slated in place the next

143
00:04:21,049 --> 00:04:24,710
epic waymaker protein is always a shadow

144
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:25,610
and when I think of iconic red carpet I

145
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:27,680
said it looks that I've literally

146
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:29,060
changed industry let's be real the first

147
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,370
person to come to mind is Miss Kim

148
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,540
kardashian-west her makeup artist Mario

149
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:34,130
and her have created so many iconic

150
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,630
looks together and cameras always buy at

151
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:37,700
such an amazing friend and role model to

152
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:39,650
me so let's see what she has to suggest

153
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:43,600
hi mom hope you're doing well and the

154
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:45,800
reaction to the new collection has been

155
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:49,790
amazing you might want smoking like

156
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:53,930
chronic look so up maybe I can create an

157
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:57,919
iconic one with your suggestion well

158
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:58,940
Matt's the beard Santa T okay so the

159
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:03,190
positive thought to give me more details

160
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:03,190
what you mean oops I said grow products

161
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:11,810
[Music]

162
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:16,960
myself brow products let's do a dessert

163
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:21,169
than that let's let's let's see what

164
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:26,419

165
00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:32,390
what let's see what she let's see what

166
00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:34,160
she suggests another person that always

167
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:36,050
has iconic eyeshadow looks has got to be

168
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,070
Queen and Lady Gaga I don't think she'll

169
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:38,930
answer I've never gotten to meet her

170
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,440
before but I want to literally so so

171
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:41,450
badly

172
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,950
Lady Gaga inspired me so much as a kid

173
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:44,479
and truly was somebody who like made me

174
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:45,770
feel like it was a paid to be myself I

175
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,120
love her hopefully one day I will be

176
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:48,890
able to give her a hug and to say thank

177
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,270
you for everything she has done also she

178
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,860
just announced her new makeup line a

179
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:53,930
house laboratories I already pre-ordered

180
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:55,460
the entire thing so if you guys want to

181
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:57,470
review when that comes out definitely

182
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:59,060
let me know but let's see she has an

183
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:00,470
eyeshadow recommendation after I said it

184
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,780
always comes mascara and the person that

185
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:04,610
I absolutely 100% want to damn for this

186
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:06,080
is Queen Paris Hilton

187
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:08,630
because I feel like she always has a

188
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,680
beautiful stunning lash on so I think

189
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:11,960

on the next step of my makeup routine is

202
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,650
always high later when I think of a

203
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:50,780
highlighter the absolute first person

204
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:52,580
that comes to mind is JLo she literally

205
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:54,410
revolutionized highlighter and just

206
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:56,720
going from within I've met her a person

207
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:57,919
before she is literally the most perfect

208
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,660
looking human being you could ever

209
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,070
imagine in your entire life she and

210
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:02,900

217
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:13,460
show right now I want to do one other

218
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:15,169
person for highlighter and I think we

219
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,789
need a boy and this here's somewhere

220
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:18,560

221
00:07:16,789 --> 00:07:20,419
damned a single boy yet oh my god let's

222
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,490
do Troye Sivan he's literally killing it

223
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:24,380
in the musical right now and he started

224
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:26,330
on YouTube so hopefully he will

225
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:28,729
appreciate the effort going into this

226
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:30,260
video and will definitely reply let me

227
00:07:28,729 --> 00:07:31,970
write to him after her that her next

228
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:34,010
voice comes my lips and of course we

229
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:36,380
have the perfect person to Diana for a

230
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:38,449
lip suggested that as Queen Kylie Jenner

231
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,860
herself and venture of the Kylie lip kit

232
00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:41,509
she thought it has every shade you could

233
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,610
possibly imagine so I know still have a

234
00:07:41,509 --> 00:07:45,020
good suggestion and last but finally not

235
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:47,150
least we have Settings ready to walk my

236
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:48,650
face in place all day long and for this

237
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:50,150
step I wanted am probably the most

238
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:53,630
famous person on the entire planet right

239
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:54,860
now and that is a lil nos ex who better

240
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:56,810
to suggest the settings pray and then

241
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:58,639
him it because if he's taking his horses

242
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:00,830
to the old town road I feel like horse

243
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,419
riding is like a very or rigorous sports

244
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:04,490
so he's got her know how to keep the

245
00:08:02,419 --> 00:08:06,050
makeup on all day long I feel like I

246
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:07,220
want to do one last person for Settings

247
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:09,860
bright and I think I need to do someone

248
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:11,660
that like knows Beauty at least a little

249
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:15,340
bit Oh

00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:19,820

253
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:24,140
the most beautiful child probably ever

254
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,930
in the entire world

255
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:28,190
y'all better watch out she's coming oh

256
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:29,450
my god I could not even believe that I

257
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:32,060
would forget this but we need to do our

258
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:33,349
king Shawn Mendes hello Shawn and I have

259
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:34,970
Dan back and forth on Twitter and we

260
00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:36,470
also Matt the mikela for the first time

261
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:39,020
and he was literally the nicest ever I

262
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:40,849
was so nervous to be there like you guys

263
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:42,470
have no idea but he gave me such an

264
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:44,360
amazing pep talk it was just really a

265
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:46,250
really dope and down to earth we took a

266
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,500
selfie together but we've never talked

267
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:50,000
to her Instagram DM so I'm hoping that

268
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,290
he sees this and will reply it later on

269
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,490
all right you guys that I think that is

270
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:54,200
pretty much every single step of a

271
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,610
makeup routine obviously we have to wait

272
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,410
for people to reply a few people have

273
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:59,030
already started answering which is so so

274
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:00,170
cool but I'm gonna go ahead and head to

275
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:01,610

everybody's suggestions all right you

280
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:09,620
guys hello a good morning we were back

281
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,960
in the sister studio I just got back

282
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:13,640
super super late last night from a long

283
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,080
weekend with the family over the long

284
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,840
weekend long this party up in Lake

285
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:19,010
Havasu we got quite a lot of responses

286
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,870
first today's video probably through my

287
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:22,820
fear of celebrities and I'm so excited

288
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:23,930
so let's just dive right in all right

289
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,340
you guys so obviously you know what the

290
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,930
first seven every makeup routine is

291
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:28,400
always going to be a primer and we

292
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:30,500
reached out to quite a few different

293
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:33,140
people that have hash tag skin goals for

294
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:35,300
primer and after five days unfortunately

295
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:37,430
none of them replied so this video is

296
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:39,020
off to a really really good start but I

297
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:40,820
will say obviously they're all very very

298
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:42,410
busy and out of all the makeup steps

299
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:44,180
this is the only one that didn't get a

300
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:45,680
response and I didn't even used to use

301
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:47,300
primer beforehand so I feel like we can

302
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,190
definitely go ahead and skip it and move

303
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,870
right on to foundation and this step was

304
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:52,550
actually not looking too promising in

305
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:54,500
the whole response

306
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:56,240
department either and Tolle I was in the

307
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,400
shower singing and performing my concert

308
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,290
as usual line anyway business you don't

309
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,450
get his sister squeaky clean and ready

310
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:05,360
for this video today until they heard my

311
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:07,760
phone ding and it was it Ben Sarah

312
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,430
notification and I opened the shower

313
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:15,880
door dripping wet and I glanced over at

314
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:20,180
my phone and you know who's came almost

315
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:22,420
Rihanna bad girl RiRi CEO affinity

316
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:25,029
beauty and the most paid

317
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:26,920
entertainer in the world sent me a

318
00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:28,839
message and I literally had never found

319
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:30,190
gold harder and my entire life I'm sure

320
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:32,230
you guys can already guess what she

321
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:34,240
recommended but to steer employed and

322
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:35,769
she said I'm so honored and grateful but

323
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,420
you already know you got to use the pro

324
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:40,290
filter foundation that started all off

325
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:40,290
right thank you

326
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,279
you guys heard it right here for the

327
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:49,810
Queen herself and if you guys know if

328
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:51,519
you've had a long time sister subscriber

329
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:53,139
when I first tried the Fendi foundation

330
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,149
I really really did not like it but

331
00:10:53,139 --> 00:10:56,620
after trying a few more times I fell in

332
00:10:55,149 --> 00:10:58,149
love with the formula I have a few

333
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:00,100
different shades that matched me very

334
00:10:58,149 --> 00:11:01,630
very well but since I got tan at the

335
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:04,420
lake I did go ahead and pick up a few at

336
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:07,120
different shape to try out 190 185 and

337
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:10,269
210 it's let's go ahead and get our base

338
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:13,870
on and find this is that oh my god this

339
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:16,449
is too late for me I never thought this

340
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:20,769
day would come where I actually got tan

341
00:11:16,449 --> 00:11:22,630
and my foundation is too light this is a

342
00:11:20,769 --> 00:11:24,370
plot twist y'all didn't expect we're

343
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:27,100
just gonna blend our pro filter all over

344
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:29,170
and get some good full coverage as usual

345
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:31,180
a but quite a lot of like a sunburn and

346
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:32,769
a sunspots that I need to cover up so

347
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:35,320
this be the perfect foundation and base

348
00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:37,000
to do so okay you guys so for concealer

349
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:39,399

00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:12,550
this is very very thick then it's gonna

367
00:12:10,569 --> 00:12:15,399
put it in using my morphe sponge as

368
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:16,449
usual oh my god Zara was not kidding

369
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:19,750
when she said this concealer was full

370
00:12:16,449 --> 00:12:24,519
coverage literally holy crap okay

371
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:26,500
low-key high key middle key is a

372
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:27,430
concealer combo looks so good right now

373
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,870
it is not even finding

374
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:29,980
I'm like obsessed with all the slugs

375
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:32,080
this is the most full coverage I think

376
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:34,060
I've ever been but I'm really not mad

377
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,560
about it before I go in and get Creasy

378
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:37,300
let's move on to our next step which is

379
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,980
going to be setting powder and the one

380
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,730
person that replied right away was my

381
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:42,310
queen

00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:44,230
Kemp HS oh my god I literally love her

383
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:47,290

love you whoaaah and pass it on I

388
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:57,399
literally had to apply and say oh my god

389
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:59,200
I love you so much because of that is

390
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:01,420
such a classic akin what type of

391
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,589
response and we have this right here a

392
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,970
lot of that Fendi beauties already

393
00:13:02,589 --> 00:13:05,980
getting two plugs in those videos today

394
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:11,200
let's go ahead and do as she says and

395
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:12,970
pack it on okay if this is not packed on

396
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,880
I don't even know what packed on who

397
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:17,260
could possibly be my face feels so set

398
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,540
and locked in place they all gotta go

399
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:21,550
ahead and brush the access away and then

400
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:22,839
we'll be ready for the next step

401
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,459
so this age does the game our makeup is

402
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:26,620
nice and said please but we're looking

403
00:13:24,459 --> 00:13:28,630
at very very flat so we're going to go

404
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:30,220
into our next step which is a bronzer I

405
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:32,920
originally D ended my friend and good

406
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:34,510
says Iggy Azalea about a primer she did

407
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,800
reply and she said that she does the new

408
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:37,959
primary she doesn't care because her

409
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,700
makeup routine is trash direct quote

410
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:40,720
from her would I totally disagree good

411
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,880
because the rank-up always looks

412
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,510
literally perfect but regardless it

413
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,370
doesn't matter

414
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:46,690
she recommended a bronzer and said it so

415
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:48,370
for today we're gonna be using her

416
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:50,200
suggestion which is too late on de

417
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:52,270
Chanel I've seen literally every single

418
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:54,490
Beauty your ever in history uses bronzer

419
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:56,350
but I never actually have so I was aided

420
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:57,910
to try it out like step one into the

421
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:59,740
skin oh yeah that looks pretty okay

422
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:01,209
oh I now see why everyone's obsessed

423
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,380
with this this looks so pretty

424
00:14:01,209 --> 00:14:04,450
next thing when I add just a little bit

425
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:05,950
more color using a little bit of a blush

426
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:08,020
and for this I reached out to one person

427
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:10,300
and one person only and that is because

428
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:12,910
this person literally wrote back within

429
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:15,610
minutes the first time which is so so

430
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:17,500
cool and that is Billy Bobby Brown also

431
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:19,630
known as 11 and changer things literally

432
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,850
is such an incredible child actress I

433
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:24,640
obviously love her and really recommend

434
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:26,200
it at the Charlotte Tilbury blush and I

435
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,520
asked her any specific seed and she said

436
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:30,220
no any one you want

437
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:32,020
you look beautiful which is so so sweet

438
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,950
I went to the Sun picked up the

439
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,810
Charlotte Tilbury

440
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:36,010
cheek to cheek now if you've been around

441
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:38,290
for a while you guys would know that

442
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:40,600
blush is kind of a newer step to a

443
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:42,490
makeup routine now I will say I was a

444
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,829
little nervous at the charlotte tilbury

445
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:46,089
counter because their blush range is a

446
00:14:44,829 --> 00:14:47,560
little questionable

447
00:14:46,089 --> 00:14:49,900
I'm not gonna lie the color that I

448
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:51,520
picked up tag is this this combination

449
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:54,130
was the only one that I thought I could

450
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:55,720
maybe make work so I'm just gonna go in

451
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:56,800
and apply it very very lightly you know

452
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,750
I feel like when you're somebody like

453
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:01,300
Billy Bobby Brown who's like actually

454
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:03,940
perfect already at age 15 it's really

455
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:05,890
hard to make her look bad right but me

456
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:07,930
on the other hand it's not hard so I'm

457
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:09,490
gonna apply a very tiny little bit of

458
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:11,680
this and hope to god that it doesn't

459
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:13,600
ruin my entire makeup look okay that's

460
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,620
not bad at all I was a little scared

461
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,209
there first I kind of not gonna lie but

462
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:17,230
I like how this looks before I move on

463
00:15:16,209 --> 00:15:18,279
to the next time I'm just gonna really

464
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:20,410
quickly got a little bit more of that

465
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:22,540
Pentium Beauty loose powder and butter

466
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:24,100
and it like my girl Kim Pedro said I'm

467
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:26,170
really pack it on and just do a little

468
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,490
bit of baking all right you guys well my

469
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:28,570
face is basically in place I'm gonna

470
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:30,339
move on to the next step which is going

471
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:31,600
to be eyebrows and I want to reach out

472
00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:33,520
to somebody who I know always has

473
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,800
perfect eyebrows and that is Madison

00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:38,020

haha what do you mean grow products and

478
00:15:41,529 --> 00:15:46,150
in this moment I realized I spelled a

479
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:48,670
brow as growl instead so what a correct

480
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:50,020
way so she said anastacio always a brow

481
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:52,540
pencil and medium brown which is

482
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:54,400
actually the literal exact color that i

483
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:56,170

495
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,029

496
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:17,500
crazy look on the red carpet obviously

498
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:21,699
outside-of-the-box makeup look we don't

exactly do a neutral glam very often on

500
00:16:21,699 --> 00:16:25,150
this YouTube channel and the first

501
00:16:23,709 --> 00:16:28,029
person to reply it was none other than

502
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:29,500
the living legend my own mother Kim

503
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:31,150
kardashian-west

504
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,370
literally within at 4 minutes actually

505
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:34,720
be sending her to Yama icon and she said

506
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:36,130
for sure so fun

507
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,560
did you see the tutorial opening I

508
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:39,269
posted on Instagram

509
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,579
was annoying me trying to take over so I

510
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:44,670
started tutorial and said hi sister hey

511
00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:45,810
sister I said I know I tweeted saying

512
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,249
that you're coming from my brand I love

513
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:48,959
you guys so much let me know what

514
00:16:47,249 --> 00:16:50,610
palette to use and she said one of your

515
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:53,100
palettes and I said no literally any pal

516
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:55,019
and she said oh then duh one of mine it

517
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:57,059
expect nothing less the Kardashians are

518
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:58,980
obviously at marketing Queens and she

519
00:16:57,059 --> 00:17:00,629
says let's do this so my era palette

520
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:02,490
which I was so stated for because I just

521
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:04,470
got the PR package in the mail literally

522
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:06,720
yesterday and I think this packaging is

523
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:09,240
so cool i actually texted him about a

524
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,459
few days prior because if we open up

525
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,659
this PR package we have the so fired

526
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:14,100
palette which we're going to use in the

527
00:17:12,659 --> 00:17:16,799
studio in a second beautiful glosses

528
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:19,370
some liner but we also have these big

529
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:23,039
matches which are actually included I

530
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:24,929
just got a splinter hi I'd like to file

531
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,520
a lawsuit against Kim Kardashian well

532
00:17:24,929 --> 00:17:30,419
which are actually included because the

533
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:32,250
side of the Pierre box can light a match

534
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:34,429
is that not literally the craziest

535
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:36,780
packaging you've ever seen this is so

536
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:39,990
friggin cool hopefully the sisters to do

537
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:41,940
does not burn down but kudos to camp

538
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:43,409
because that is innovation alright you

539
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,000
guys this is pretty much the Sapphire

540
00:17:43,409 --> 00:17:47,130
palette color scheme up right here it

541
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,510
isn't so pretty kind of simple I'm gonna

542
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:49,770
zoom you guys and I already have a look

543
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:51,570
at mine that I want to do so I'm just

544
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:52,679
going to it throw that to kind of go a

545
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,630
little bit fast because we still have a

546
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:56,220
lot of other steps to do I'm first just

547
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:57,570
taking this dark maroonish brown color

548
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:59,190
and stamping it into my outer-v

549
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:00,539
using a marquee I'm about four five six

550
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:02,070
so with it I'm four three three of

551
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:04,169
grabbing the Terracotta shade from the

552
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:06,299
palette and buffing right over top of

553
00:18:04,169 --> 00:18:07,919
that edge driving at em 5:13 and dipping

554
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:09,179
into that light brown kind of

555
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,309
transitional color I'm just going to

556
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:12,840
very lightly buff out that top edge I'm

557
00:18:11,309 --> 00:18:14,460
gonna do a soft cut crease using the

558
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,899
gold shade in the bottom corner I'm

559
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,880
gonna add a little bit of Y by using an

560
00:18:15,899 --> 00:18:18,960
angled brush and the dark moon shade it

561
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,220
from the palette once again

562
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,780
alright you guys that it's already one

563
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:24,059
eye using the Soulfire palette all

564
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:25,470
complete I think it looks so setting in

565
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:26,549
definitely reminds me of the campfire

566
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:27,960
I'm gonna go and do the other one off

567
00:18:26,549 --> 00:18:29,610
camera quickly and I'll be right back to

568
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,049
do it the next step alright you guys

569
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:32,520
know that eyes are all done it is time

570
00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:34,649
for our next step which is going to be

571
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:36,090
it lashes now in the beginning of this

572
00:18:34,649 --> 00:18:37,200
video when I was jamming people I said

573
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:39,419
that I really wanted someone who was

574
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,909
always super super painted the house

575
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:43,470
down so I could actually get like a good

576
00:18:41,909 --> 00:18:46,020
last recommendation because there's a

577
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:47,120
good lash and there's like God lashes a

578
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,220
lot could really really

579
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,290
break a look so I went ahead and DM the

580
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:53,930
first ever influencer the iconic woman

581
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:56,650
who started it all and that has Paris

582
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:59,000
Hilton and let me tell you she did not

583
00:18:56,650 --> 00:19:00,890
dissipate at all

584
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:14,660
Paris robot can set me at this video

585
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:16,309
first magic must be able to be like I'll

586
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:19,280
give my favorite Laster by me

587
00:19:16,309 --> 00:19:21,200
I heard mascaras also by me literal

588
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,880
goals hello I need that to be me you one

589
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,340

00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:28,640
I said it she did not disappoint

592
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:30,230
I don't home yesterday and expected a

593
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,170
small little package on my front porch

594
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:34,190
of lashes and mascara but no it's pure

595
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:37,610
self that who's literally the queen of

596
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:39,620
extra and this is what I got literally

597
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:41,330
every single product you could ever

598
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:42,500
imagine I'm not even gonna lie I didn't

599
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:45,230
even know Paris Houston how to makeup

600
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:47,179
line but I'm not mad about it and cannot

601
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:48,500
wait to literally try all of this I'm

602
00:19:47,179 --> 00:19:50,600
gonna go ahead and grab the lashes and

603
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:52,250
mascara and pop them on and try all this

604
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,290
for later so this actually comes with

605
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:56,650
three different mascaras to choose from

606
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:59,420
we have lengthening volumizing and

607
00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:01,130
curling mascara for this I think I'm

608
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:02,540
gonna grab the lengthening mascara since

609
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:04,910

00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:07,280

we are almost the end of this look you

640
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,700
guys we've sought to tie the entire look

641
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,590
together by adding one last thing and

642
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:16,150
that is the D lipid e doodahs and who

643
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:17,980
better to ask for her lips suggest and

644
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:19,360
then the queen of lips herself literally

645
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:21,730
revolutionized lips in the makeup

646
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,680
industry and that is a kylie jenner

647
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:25,510
kylie replied and said ah yes are you

648
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:27,190
feeling a crazy color or totally up to

649
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:29,470
me and i said it literally pick whatever

650
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:31,360
color you want and she simply said i'm

651
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:33,100
sending you stuff now no I literally got

652
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,080
that damn from Kylie as I was leaving my

653
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:37,090
house on the way to vacation so I spent

654
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:39,310
the entire weekend having absolutely no

655
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:41,110
idea what I was gonna end up with on my

656
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:43,120
lips but when I got home uh surely

657
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:45,040
enough there was a bag on my front porch

658
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,510
labeled James Charles with some Kylie

659
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:48,340
products in it and hopefully this look

660
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:51,400
combo will match this look perfectly we

661
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:53,290
have a snow way bae kylie jenner matte

662
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:55,360
liquid lipstick and lip liner we also

663
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:58,450
have a Kylie lip liner in the shade

664
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,980
coconut and a lipstick in the shade it

665
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:01,840
snatched let's see what we got oh I

666
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:04,150

667
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:06,700
color with this yes okay

668
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:08,140
let's hope snatch is a good lip to go on

669
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,190
top well it's literally like she knew

670
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:11,050
what the look was gonna be before it

671
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:12,760
even happened and last but finally not

672
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:14,410
least the ultimate step of the makeup

673
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,820
routine is going to be our a setting

674
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:17,830
spray for the step I did reach out to

675
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:19,600
kind of a lot of different people idea

676
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:21,190
Shawn Mendes i DM little moss acts that

677
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,330
I also damnit a Shay Mitchell because I

678
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:24,400
wasn't really sure who was going to

679
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:26,170
reply and this depth was actually the

680
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,750
only step of the routine that we had two

681
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:30,340
different people reply for little lost

682
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:31,960
acts did not respond he must have been

683
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:34,090
busy writing has a 57th

684
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:35,530
Ulta the rotary works and getting ready

685
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:37,450
to release it by the way its treatment

686
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:39,610
now even though he didn't reply or soul

687
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:43,000
sister supporting but Shawn Mendes

688
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:44,590
actually responded I was honestly 100%

689
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,810
not even expecting Shawn to see the

690
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:48,730
message let alone respond so when his

691
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:50,620
name popped up in my phone I was shocked

692
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:51,940
and also very very excited

693
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:53,170

694
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:54,250
wanted to think about it and thank you
