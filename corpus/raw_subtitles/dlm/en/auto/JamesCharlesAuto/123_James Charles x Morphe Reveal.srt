that you guys just saw at the end of the

24
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,240
campaign commercial I created this over

25
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:43,100
six months ago now and you have no idea

26
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,350
I have never wanted to post an Instagram

27
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,610
picture more and I can tire life but

28
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:48,259
I've had to hold it back and keep it a

29
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:50,149
secret I am so proud of how this look

30
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:52,789
turned out it was inspired by my look

31
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:54,530
from 2017 a blank canvas and we had this

32
00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:56,420
beautiful like Bay packaging and we have

33
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:58,399
more Fiats James Charles and my iconic

34
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:00,350
sister signature and just a white glossy

35
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,210
font the packaging is super super

36
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:04,310
minimalist but I absolutely love it and

37
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:05,780
think it is just so chic and we turn the

38
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:07,700
pala to the back we have this cute

39
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:09,890
little note from me sister David it says

40
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:12,170

00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:14,000

42
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:16,310
but I also have a huge passion for crazy

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,930
colorful outside of the box makeup and I

44
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:19,700
created this palette with that in mind I

45
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:21,500
included every beautifully formally to

46
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:23,600
change necessary to create literally any

47
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,340

58
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:47,750

on the fries in a shiny box has more

70
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:16,280
Phoenix James Charles just like the

71
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,500
packaging on the outside and the white

72
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,960
it is just very very sleek minimalistic

73
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:32,920
very much my overall style oh my god I

74
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:36,290
have it open this on camera 439

75
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,490
beautiful amazing colors now the top of

76
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:39,050
the packaging we have this little saying

77
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:41,380
right up here that you heard at the end

78
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:44,420
of the campaign commercial in my little

79
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:46,850
isn't that it unleash your inner artist

80
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:49,820
now I've had this quote in the Notes app

81
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:51,709
on my phone for literally two years now

82
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:53,750
and I knew that I wanted to use it for a

83
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:55,459
big project and hello what better to use

84
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,750
it for that this eyeshadow palette my

85
00:03:55,459 --> 00:03:58,550
admission as an artist inside of the

86
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:00,260
community has always been making it fun

87
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:02,330
creating a new content doing things that

88
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,620
nobody would ever dare to do taking a

89
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:05,000
step away from tutorials and making

90
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,500
Beauty videos actually entertaining

91
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,090
playing with color playing with

92
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,980
avant-garde looks that most people would

93
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:11,150
necessarily deem where will a brutal

94
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:12,380
content and they're doing that I've been

95
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:14,420
able to express myself and put myself

96
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:15,980
out there and find all of your sisters

97
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,330
and find such an amazing audience that

98
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:19,640
also has such a love and appreciation

99
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:21,230
for art so that is why we are unleashing

100
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,610
our inner artist with this collection

101
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:24,020
now obviously you'll notice that there

102
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:25,550
is a plastic knife that comes over all

103
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:27,950
the shades is obviously protects that

104
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:29,810
wall traveling but all the stadiums are

105
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:32,840
also listed on every single one of the

106
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:33,830
colors there are 39 iconic Shay names

107
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,450
that you guys are definitely going to

108
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,890
recognize from all my sister sayings and

109
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:38,600
also some things that definitely have a

110
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:39,860
personal wing to me as well we're going

111
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,030
to get into those in a quick second but

112
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,710
for now I'm just going to take this off

113
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:45,020
and show you guys

114
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:46,039
a pallet in all its glory obviously you

115
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:48,229
guys know the morphe palettes usually

116
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:49,610
come with 35 but this one comes with 39

117
00:04:48,229 --> 00:04:51,830
with the middle row all hopping Baker

118
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:53,300
pans this is obviously remodeled after

119
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:55,310
the 39a which is the palette that

120
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,990
launched last holiday season that I was

121
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:58,669
actually the model for I'm gonna dive

122
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:00,320
into each individual shade in a second

123
00:04:58,669 --> 00:05:02,150
but before I do that I want to put the

124
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,590
palette into three sections and kind of

125
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:05,150
explain how I organized it and why it

126
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:06,800
looks like what it does and it's gonna

127
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:09,410
make a lot more sense right now

128
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,910
so unleash your inner artist the whole

129
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:12,710
point of creating my sister collection

130
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:14,150
with morphe was that I felt like there

131
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:16,430
was something missing on the market and

132
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:19,669
that was one I shadow palette that could

133
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:21,229
truly create any single look no I know

134
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:23,030
this palette is obviously very very big

135
00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:24,259
but the whole point in making this was

136
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,520
that you could travel with it take it

137
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:27,139
anywhere take it on set if you're

138
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,669
working makeup artist have it in your

139
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:30,530
kit if you're at home beauty guru like

140
00:05:28,669 --> 00:05:33,199
myself and literally be able to create

141
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:34,610
any single look imaginable so the top

142
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,830
two rows of the palette are for my more

143
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:38,389
everyday wearable glam Shana type of

144
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:39,889
people now the middle role you'll notice

145
00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:41,539
are all the bigger shades now more we

146
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:43,400
did this for the first time in the 39a

147
00:05:41,539 --> 00:05:44,360
palette and they did all the transition

148
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,440
shades because I thought what's so cool

149
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,240
- how much time does to say for each

150
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,889
different skin tone but you definitely

151
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,789
don't need someone transition change so

152
00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:52,370
what did I do

153
00:05:49,789 --> 00:05:53,599
I made these seven middle shades all the

154
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:55,280
most-used

155
00:05:53,599 --> 00:05:57,349
shades no matter what look you're

156
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,940
creating so we have a matte white and a

157
00:05:57,349 --> 00:06:00,710
matte block perfect for setting your

158
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:02,870
base or deepening anything up whether it

159
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:05,330
be a typical everyday glam look or an

160
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:06,979
artistry or even a try look we have a

161
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:08,389
highlighting shade this is literally one

162
00:06:06,979 --> 00:06:10,280
of the most beautiful highlighters ever

163
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:12,740
I will show you in a second and then

164
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:15,949
these four colors are all four colors

165
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:17,990
needed to create literally any warm tone

166
00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:19,400
of smoky eyes so you have your

167
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:20,599
transition shade you have your deepening

168
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,530
shade you have your further deepening

169
00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:23,000
speed and then you have your further

170
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,630
deepening shape now what you've all been

171
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,940
waiting for

172
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:27,320
last but certainly not least the bottom

173
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:30,620
two rows of the palette are all of our

174
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:32,240
rainbow shades now as an artist and

175
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:34,370
starting off I have always wanted my

176
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,409
perfect rainbow eyeshadow kit but I have

177
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:38,120
never been able to find it obviously the

178
00:06:36,409 --> 00:06:39,979
morphe 35c as muslin that I've used for

179
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,380
a very very long time but it is gone now

180
00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:44,389
r.i.p it gone and now to be forgotten to

181
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:45,440
replace by this baby right here there

182
00:06:44,389 --> 00:06:46,789
were definitely a lot of shades in there

183
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,740
that I felt like needed a major major

184
00:06:46,789 --> 00:06:49,270
improvement so when I had this palette I

185
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,860
di

186
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:52,990
morpheme very very closely to firmly

187
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:55,450
every single one of these J's to create

188
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:57,070
literally the most bomb rainbow

189
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:58,480
eyeshadow colors you will ever see in

190
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:59,920
your entire life so before we actually

191
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,180
get into the individual swatches I do

192
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,710
want to kind of go over each of the

193
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:04,840
individual foremost we have going on in

194
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:06,040
here because there quite a few I did

195
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,360
tell you guys that this is a very very

196
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:10,330
versatile palette and I was definitely

197
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,920
not lying so we of course have our

198
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:13,240
beautiful metallic shades all throughout

199
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,220
the palette they're going to be applied

200
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,440
best with your finger or a damp brush

201
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:19,270
using a Assessor settings bright we do

202
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,860
have one glitter kind of metallic

203
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:22,900
pigment as well you guys are going to be

204
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:24,280
shook when you see this and this is kind

205
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,800
of like a layering shade that is best

206
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:28,690
Pat on lightly we have one a beautiful

207
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,670
blinding highlight shade as well and

208
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:32,590
then of course majority of this palette

209
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:34,870
is a beautiful vibrant pigmented or

210
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:36,010
rainbow matte shades now I do want to

211
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:38,050
touch on the map shape and some of these

212
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:39,430
formulas behind them because most of the

213
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:41,710
math in this palette are considered

214
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:43,870
pressed pigments and not typical

215
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:45,460
eyeshadows now what does that mean I

216
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:47,680
didn't know until very recently when I

217
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:48,790
was formulating this with Murphy but now

218
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,380
I do is I want to share with you guys

219
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:51,520
the ingredients and pressed pigments are

220
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,930
just slightly different than iron

221
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,940
shadows and they are actually exactly

222
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:57,400
what their name says it is literally

223
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:59,410
just the actual color pigment pressed

224
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,180
right into a pan ready for you to use

225
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:02,560
whereas the iPhone has a lot of other

226
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:04,720
stuff mixed in it as well to make it

227
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,400
perform it really beautifully now that

228
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,810
being said by doing press Penguins it

229
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,850
allows you to make the most vibrant true

230
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:11,710
to color product ever and I am so

231
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:14,020
incredibly proud of these as an artist I

232
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:15,370
will say straight up to you guys some of

233
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:17,140
these pressed pigments are a little bit

234
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,920
harder to work with it just because you

235
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:20,230
have to use slightly different

236
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:22,780
techniques but once you figure them out

237
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:23,830
they are so incredibly beautiful and I

238
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:26,620
know that you guys are going to fall in

239
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:28,180
love of them so my advice to you I have

240
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:30,520
personally found that packing on the

241
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:32,050
pressed pigments with a flat brush works

242
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,220
the absolute best to get maximum color

243
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:37,060
payoff and to make sure all the shadows

244
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:39,100
stay in place and as well I always use

245
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:41,950
shave tape or my concealer as an eyelid

246
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:43,780
primer before doing any eyeshadow for

247
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:45,910
the press pigments I would actually not

248
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:47,680
recommend this now this may come as a

249
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:49,030
little bit of a shock to you guys but

250
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,610
have you been describing me for a very

251
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:51,990
very long time

252
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:53,820
that I'm definitely a firm believer and

253
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:57,779
the makeup conspiracy that primer is a

254
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:59,940
scam now I'll okay still to this day but

255
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:01,649
when it comes to these press penguins I

256
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,149
swear to god you guys

257
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:05,010
myself and the morphe team have found

258
00:09:03,149 --> 00:09:06,870
out over the past several months that

259
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:08,220
using these press payments on an actual

260
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:09,959
product that is formulated for the

261
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:12,300
eyelids is going to make the shades

262
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:14,910
perform so beautifully and it's going to

263
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,529
give you the best result possible now I

264
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:18,120
really like using the Mac Paint Pot for

265
00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:19,470
this and I also like the morphe eyelid

266
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,120
primer as well and it's only a few

267
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:22,620
dollars with code James for 10% off your

268
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,149
purchase I've never believed in this

269
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,380
I've never cared enough but through

270
00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:27,810
trying these press 10 minutes I will

271
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:29,070
100% say confidently that you're going

272
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:30,990
to want to use a product specifically

273
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:32,579
formulated for the eyelids for maximum

274
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:34,320
blunt ability for maximum payoff and for

275
00:09:32,579 --> 00:09:36,240
maximum pigmentation it all about being

276
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,680
said let's jump into the sponges so the

277
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,839
version in the top left corner is called

278
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,550
canvas it is inspired by my iconic blank

279
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,380
canvas look from last year and it's just

280
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:45,019
a super light and bone color shade and

281
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:47,220
it's perfect for setting the lid okay

282
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:48,120
starting off with a blank canvas can

283
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,510
barely see that because it's like my

284
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,380
skin tone color but it's there

285
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:53,880
next time we have the shade of ring

286
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,440
light which is obviously inspired by my

287
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,000
iconic ear by story that started it all

288
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,860
and this one is just like a metallic

289
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,990
kind of bright gold it's literally

290
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:05,790
almost metallic white and so pretty

291
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:08,160
Hello next ring like we have this gold

292
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:10,320
shade called so good I love this color

293
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,480
so much when creating a gold I really

294
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,610
wanted it to be a light true gold eyes

295
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,110
like so many gold either route to bronzy

296
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:18,930
or to yellow and this one it's like

297
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:22,079
right in the middle so good well I'm not

298
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:23,519

which is called a five one eight

301
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:28,470
inspired by my hometown area code where

302
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,300
school colors for orange and black so

303
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:32,130
this is like a little ode to my past

304
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:34,949
length basically and this one is a

305
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:37,079
bright vivid orange now this formula

306
00:10:34,949 --> 00:10:39,060
looks matte but it is one of the shades

307
00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:44,640
in the palette that is a pressed pigment

308
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:47,160

little bit more of a vivid orange color

311
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:53,040
this one is called rusted because I

312
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:54,180
always say crusted busted dusted

313
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:59,370

00:10:54,180 --> 00:11:00,959

orange color and it is called Halloween

317
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:06,300
inspired by my favorite time of the

318
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:07,769
entire year and when I officially

319
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:15,630

flashlight Mary this is named after my

359
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:36,860
best friend drew now Mary used to

360
00:12:33,569 --> 00:12:39,839
actually be a terminus used derogatorily

361
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:41,790
is that a word directed it was it was a

362
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,860
derogatory term towards gay people a

363
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:45,600
very very long time ago but the gays

364
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:47,100
have reclaimed it as we always do and

365
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,110
now I mean all my gay friends but I say

366
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:52,130

I love this color so next to Mary we

369
00:12:55,770 --> 00:13:00,060
have this shade right here called

370
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:01,890
literally now this is literally one of

371
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:04,590
my favorite colors in the entire palette

372
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:07,260
because it is like this bright pinky

373
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:09,450
peach color and it is slightly metallic

374
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:11,130
and when you swatch it it actually gonna

375
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:13,440
be honest is not even that impressive

376
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:15,839
but I'm originally why I love it so much

377
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,580
it looks like this when you swatch it

378
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,950
I guess that is so really really pretty

379
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:21,390
but you could either layer on a lot of

380
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:24,000
it and get a color just like this which

381
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:25,500
obviously is very very stunning or you

382
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,630
can use that in little doses which is

383
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,880
how I personally love it so if you take

384
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:31,230
a brush like this which is like the 501

385
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,060
this isn't my brush that we talked about

386
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:34,080
this in a little bit you can apply to us

387
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:36,779
right on the cheekbone and it will give

388
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:38,520
you a beautiful light pink glow or you

389
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:39,810
can use it on an e for brush which is my

390
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,490
all-time favorite blush brush also

391
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:43,080
available in my brush set and you can

392
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:44,339
pack just a little bit more on and

393
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,020
because it's like a peach color right in

394
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:47,250
between pink and orange you can blend it

395
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,480
right in between your highlighter and

396
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:52,260
the bronzer and it will blend it

397
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:54,779
together so so so beautifully I'm

398
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:56,760
obsessed with literally this shade right

399
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:58,560
here is the color that I am the most

400
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:01,080
proud about releasing in this palette

401
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,640
now this shade right here is called Kerr

402
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,780
kidding and you're gonna see why it's

403
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:06,420
called that when I swatch it in about

404
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:08,670
three seconds from now but I have wanted

405
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:10,170
a true red color in an eyeshadow palette

406
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:11,760
since I started to do makeup and it does

407
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:13,020
not exist

408
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,630
literally every single round is either

409
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:18,450
not pigmented o or it tends to run to

410
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:20,810
magenta or to orange this is rad are you

411
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,810
ready for this

412
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:38,070
you're kidding oh my god why have you

413
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:39,570
ever seen a bag that good we went back

414
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:42,600
and forth on formulations for the shade

415
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:43,740
so many times but you guys I cannot wait

416
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,760
for you to have this in your hands and

417
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,620
start playing to them because this is

418
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,839
literally the best red eyeshadow on the

419
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:51,000
entire market and I can say that so

420
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:52,470
confidently that's you're kidding next

421
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,110
to it you're kidding we have the shade

422
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:56,880
shucks and this is a metallic cranberry

423
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:58,350
red now this is not actually similar to

424
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,880
Halloween and I'll swatch them X to each

425
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:01,440
other I really wanted to create a

426
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,580
metallic cranberry rabbit because I feel

427
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,120
like a lot of the metallic orange and

428
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:06,070
metallic red shades tend to look

429
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,450
very similar and they wanted that true

430
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:08,680
metallic red shade that you can put

431
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:10,089
right over and you're kidding and have

432
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,560
it look so beautiful look at how good

433
00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:13,930
that looks next to shucks we have this

434
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:15,730
deep matte red maroon color right here

435
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:17,529
called a boutique that this is obviously

436
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:19,120
named after my best friend Laura and her

437
00:15:17,529 --> 00:15:20,710
entire family who owns a Laura's

438
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,940

California Laura is my best friend in

441
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:26,770
the entire world and our family has sent

442
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,750
us so much for me I actually lived a

443
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:32,339
Laura and her family for six months

444
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:34,960
before ever moving to help so good for

445
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:36,550
what if we're actually ever moving to LA

446
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,870
and I cannot think oh I don't want to

447
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,950
start crying and I could not think her

448
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,930
and her family enough for everything

449
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:41,230
that they've done for me moving on right

450
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:43,300
away

451
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:44,980
Oh knees move on right now and the last

452
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,660
date in the second row is this deep kind

453
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:48,640
of eggplant to color right here and this

454
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:50,589
one is called it Benny this is named

455
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:52,750
after my family puppy from back home I

456
00:15:50,589 --> 00:15:53,710
literally messed him up so so so much I

457
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,210
don't know if you guys have ever

458
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:57,130
actually met him before but he is it

459
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:58,150
pretty much a discolor and this is just

460
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:00,190
going to be a perfect shade for

461
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:01,870
deepening up any look that was a

462
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:05,260
disgusting swatch I'm scared try that

463
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:06,550
again this is the shade Benny and that

464
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:08,290
is the second row of shadows all

465
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:10,000
complete so moving on to the third row

466
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:11,200
all the ones with the bigger pans once

467
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,250
again these are probably gonna be the

468
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,230
ones that you guys are gonna get the

469
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:15,550
most use out of starting off from at the

470
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:18,880
far left we have the white shade which

471
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:19,959
of course is named flush now creating a

472
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,910
matte white shade of something that I've

473
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:23,320
wanted to do for so long now because I

474
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:25,420
feel like so many of them are literally

475
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:28,690
so bad you put them on and it just

476
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:30,310
disappears this is not that watch this

477
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:35,620

478
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:37,900

there's a second layer and there is your

483
00:16:46,329 --> 00:16:50,499
third layer of white I wanted to create

484
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:53,230
a white eyeshadow that you can actually

485
00:16:50,499 --> 00:16:54,759
layer and build up to a pure white

486
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:57,100
because I feel like getting this bright

487
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:58,600
it's like literally not possible with so

488
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,069
many other brands the shade is

489
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,239
especially going to be perfect for all

490
00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:02,920
my drag queen friends I'd like to

491
00:17:01,239 --> 00:17:04,270
highlight their brow bones or use their

492
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,500
creases with a bright white shade

493
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:06,939

571
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,970
on a playground in fourth grade I was

572
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:59,620

573
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:01,390
best friend he did not wanna be mine and

574
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:02,830
that's where he's a long one this shade

575
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:04,120
is called a playground and it just means

576
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:05,860
so much to me to be able to be a machine

577
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,940
after Anthony and the palette he was

578
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:08,620
also part of creating the music for the

579
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:10,870
commercial as well which is just so cool

580
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:12,340
love you Anthony the absolute most next

581
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:15,490

582
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:18,040
here and this one is called rose ooh hey

583
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:19,630
popper mister yeah my favorite shade

584
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:22,900
favorite in the entire palate is just

585
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:25,030
like a true like blue I don't even know

586
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:26,350
like it it's just like blue there's no

587
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:29,140
green in it there's no purple and it's

588
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:30,820
just like literally true blue and I'm

589
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,330
obsessed that I think it is literally so

590
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:34,090
pretty

591
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:36,130
I will say you picked a really a really

592
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:37,660
hard color to do this is by far one of

593
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:39,640
the hardest ones to firmly and the

594
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:41,320
entire palette you gave me use so many

595
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:43,000
issues but it did turn out really really

596
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,770
beautiful in the end this one I just

597
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,670
like I 1/8 is one of the press payments

598
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:47,440
you have to work at this and a little

599
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:48,790
bit of a different way this one's gonna

600
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,170
perform best when you use packing

601
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:51,520
motions right on the lid to really make

602
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:54,990
sure that color is locked in place as

603
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:57,570
opposed to like big blending moments

604
00:20:54,990 --> 00:21:03,070
[Music]

605
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:07,690
that's brother so pigmented so brother

606
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:08,920
II next sort of brother we have this

607
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:11,470
shade right here and this one is called

608
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:15,100
artistry in honor of the palettes name

609
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:16,720
and I don't exactly know how to describe

610
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:19,930
this formula because it's not metallic

611
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,880
it's like glitter the shadow almost has

612
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:24,700
a little bit like a wet formula it has a

613
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:26,170
slight blue you can see it on camera you

614
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:29,500
could never see payments like that on

615
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:31,510
camera that's exciting that's good no

616
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:33,820
obviously it does swatch very very

617
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:36,040
beautifully but we actually created the

618
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:38,050
shade in mind for layering so whether it

619
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:39,850
be over a black or a dark purple or even

620
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:41,320
make it be white shade we created this

621
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:43,360
color to really just make it pop and

622
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:45,160
sparkle with blues and purples over top

623
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,330
of a base for maximum payoff next

624
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:48,040
artists should we have this matte

625
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:54,580
magenta shade right here and this one is

626
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:55,840
called love that love that and lost in

627
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,370
this rogue we have the light pink shade

628
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,260
right here and this one is named after

629
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:01,510
my favorite drink and the entire world

630
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:03,580
thinkety thinkety now the shade of Lee

631
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:06,870
does not swatch the most pigmented but

632
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:09,010
it's actually Wow you can there it is

633
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:10,630
well I was getting worried there first

634
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:11,830
like a it does not swatch the most later

635
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:13,900
content but and it's supposed to be a

636
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:15,370
light wash of color either on the lid or

637
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:17,350
as a transition sheet when it comes to

638
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:18,520
blending in any pink colors later on and

639
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:20,140

00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,230
sleepless nights went into the creation

734
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:18,970
and planning of this palette I've had

735
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:20,590
this idea in my head for so long now and

736
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:22,149
I cannot thank the morphe team enough

737
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:23,649
for working with me and believing in me

738
00:25:22,149 --> 00:25:25,389
and making a vision come to life you

739
00:25:23,649 --> 00:25:27,009
guys I am so incredibly proud of this

740
00:25:25,389 --> 00:25:28,720
palette I have been using it for several

741
00:25:27,009 --> 00:25:30,789
months now on the DL I'm sure you picked

742
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,080
up at this point but I could not wait

743
00:25:30,789 --> 00:25:33,190
for you guys to have this in your hands

744
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,139
so that is all the details with the

745
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:35,950
palette out of the way but I did say we

746
00:25:35,139 --> 00:25:38,529
were coming out with the sister

747
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:40,870
collection and that means we also have a

748
00:25:38,529 --> 00:25:42,309
brush set so you might be a little bit

749
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:43,570
surprised that I've created a brush set

750
00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:44,950
and that is because if you didn't call

751
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:47,080
me for a very very long time

752
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:49,360
I've actually publicly said before that

753
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,440
I don't really like brush up and you can

754
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,120
call me I'm not because for the most

755
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:54,220
part I still stand behind that to this

756
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:55,750
day but the reason behind that is

757
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:57,639
because I feel like in so many brush

758
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:59,049
sets are either too many brushes to the

759
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:00,250
point where you won't use half done

760
00:25:59,049 --> 00:26:02,019
because there's a stupid brushes that

761
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:03,820
serve no purpose or the actual set is

762
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:05,500
too small to where you have to order 20

763
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:08,830
extra brushes in order to make it a full

764
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:10,840
useable set this brush set is not that

765
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:12,879
so I got the opportunity to make a brush

766
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:14,769
set at first I was like no but then I

767
00:26:12,879 --> 00:26:15,700
was like oh actually yeah I probably

768
00:26:14,769 --> 00:26:17,289
should just make literally the best

769
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:20,169
brush set at the entire world and that

770
00:26:17,289 --> 00:26:23,740
is this brush set right here this baby

771
00:26:20,169 --> 00:26:25,450
contains 34 brushes and just like the

772
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:26,950
palette I created it with all artist in

773
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:29,500
mind that you can literally create any

774
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:31,000
single look with it so when you open up

775
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:34,389
the box of the brush set it comes just

776
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,340
like this all 34 brushes and a contour

777
00:26:34,389 --> 00:26:38,590
blending sponge right inside of a custom

778
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:40,659
James Charles X more feet Taavi case

779
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:42,429
this isn't so cute I love these for

780
00:26:40,659 --> 00:26:43,600
storing on my makeup table I have so

781
00:26:42,429 --> 00:26:45,340
many of them over here that I keep all

782
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,259
my brushes in and they are perfect for

783
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:48,429
traveling as well it comes with oh yeah

784
00:26:47,259 --> 00:26:49,929
obviously it comes with the top as well

785
00:26:48,429 --> 00:26:50,270
oh I probably should say that I just

786
00:26:49,929 --> 00:26:52,070
took

787
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:53,809
so it looks kind of cute for like a good

788
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:55,190
little displaying moment you feel me but

789
00:26:53,809 --> 00:26:56,240
this is what it looks like I'm gonna go

790
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:57,559
through the collection kind of quickly

791
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,330
just to show you guys exactly what's in

792
00:26:57,559 --> 00:27:00,650
here if you're a true Ivan morphe fan

793
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:01,910
you probably might have a lot of these

794
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:03,470
in your collection already aside from

795
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:04,850
the new brushes that I created I'll get

796
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:06,530
into those in a quick short second but

797
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:08,030
buying this brush kit is definitely not

798
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:09,140
a necessity and anything I would tell me

799
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:10,760
back on the palette out of the two of

800
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:12,110
them but I did want to create this for

801
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,520
all my artists out there as the perfect

802
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:14,780
brush set because I did it truly feel

803
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,980
like it was missing from the market I'm

804
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:17,450
gonna go in the same order that I do my

805
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:20,090
routine in and starting off we have a

806
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:21,320
foundation brush just the M 439 and my

807
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:22,970
opinion this is by far the best

808
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:24,290
foundation brush in the entire world but

809
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:27,350
if you're like me and you don't actually

810
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:28,760
like using foundation brushes so they

811
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:30,140
actually let me include the morphe

812
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,790
contour and highlight blending sponge

813
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:32,780
which I absolutely love

814
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:34,820
when you soak them in water they

815
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:36,679
actually get so large which I love for a

816
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:38,360
quick foundation application I prefer

817
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:39,770
this much over a foundation brush but

818
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:41,150
like I said this that was created for

819
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:42,320
everyone so they're both here and you

820
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:43,760
can pick whichever one you want

821
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,470
next resetting my face in place we have

822
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,790
the e 48 brush this is just a taper

823
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:47,929
powder brush that I like to use right

824
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:49,370
underneath the eyes to pack on the

825
00:27:47,929 --> 00:27:50,780
powder super cute

826
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:52,429
next for contour we have the Amma for

827
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:54,320
all five this is just a fluffy angled

828
00:27:52,429 --> 00:27:54,860
brush I love this for chiseling out the

829
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,600
cheekbones

830
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:57,770
now we're in the process of contouring I

831
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,330
did tell you guys that I've created a

832
00:27:57,770 --> 00:28:00,950
few different custom brushes for this

833
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:03,140
brush collection so I want to tell you

834
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:06,380
about the first one and that is a bit to

835
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:09,309
eat 62 now this is a tiny angled of

836
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:11,570
synthetic fluffy brush and this is for

837
00:28:09,309 --> 00:28:14,570
snatching the nose you guys know that I

838
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:16,520
live for a good sister snatched schnoz

839
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:18,020
if you go back to my older like photos

840
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:20,090
my nose contours looking at obviously

841
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:21,620
horrifying but once I learn how to

842
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:23,660
contour properly and a little bit of

843
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:25,730
face to it as well my Instagram gave a

844
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:27,350
truly shot up and I'm so proud of my

845
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:28,760
nose contour now it's on my all-time

846
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:29,990
favorite steps eye makeup routine so

847
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,640
that is why I created this one right

848
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:33,140
here it is perfect for just laying down

849
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,730
that contour and bronzer shade right up

850
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:36,370
in there and then tilting it just to

851
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:38,660
blend it oh and you're gonna snatched

852
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:41,210
for bronzer we have the big and beefy

853
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:42,650
and five to seven brush I love this for

854
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:44,360
going right in to blend together my

855
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:46,040
contour and my natural skin tone just a

856
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:47,280
light bronzer shade and its really big

857
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,480
so I can get a lot of area

858
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,370
if you're like me and you have a huge

859
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,990
forehead as well next four plus we have

860
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:54,390
the e for brush this is just a synthetic

861
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:55,740
fluffy angled brush I really really love

862
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:57,210
this for gloss application because you

863
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:59,010
can either go light and laid out a light

864
00:28:57,210 --> 00:29:01,320
wash a collar or really pack it on there

865
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:02,340
for a bright kind of drug type look this

866
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:15,330
brush the thought of my collection since

867
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:16,830
day one next for brows we have the a

868
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:18,360
matte one five eight now for me

869
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:20,070
personally I definitely do prefer a brow

870
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:21,720
pencil so I will not be getting much use

871
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:23,910
out of this brush just being straight-up

872
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:25,620
honest but I know so many sisters out

873
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:28,680
there do love a good brow pomade I mean

874
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:29,940
I definitely did it in 2016 the Sabre

875
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,620
brush that I brought Hamid is literally

876
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:33,270
what led me to James Carlos herbie block

877
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:34,830
brows but when you know how to use this

878
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:36,630
correctly and this brush can truly be a

879
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:38,250
force to be reckoned with and it is just

880
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:39,990
a tiny little ankle brush on one end and

881
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:41,550
he's fully on the other end just brush

882
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:43,410
the hairs all in place and I do love a

883
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:45,450
good angled brush once the brows are all

884
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:46,500
filled in I included the Emma 410 brush

885
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:48,090
just to clean up your brows with

886
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:50,190
concealer underneath and it's just a

887
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:52,020
flat concealer brush and then I love

888
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:53,430
using the abbot 173 with just a little

889
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:55,530
bit of translucent powder to blend in

890
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:57,180
and set the concealer in place to prep

891
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:58,500
for I shall now moving on to what you

892
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:00,630
guys know is I very part of my entire

893
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,830
makeup routine at the eyeshadow these

894
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:03,690
brushes are gonna be what you apply the

895
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:05,850
James Charles X morphe palette where the

896
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:07,230
[ __ ] there is a little bit of a twist

897
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:08,280
now we of course have all the iconic

898
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:09,750
Parsons that you guys have seen me

899
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:12,150

tutorials we have the m4 for one I love

901
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:14,850
this brush it is a big fluffy brush

902
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:15,570
perfect for layering down a transition

903
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:18,150
shade into the crease

904
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:19,650
we have the m4 33 which is my all-time

905
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:21,480
favorite crease brush I literally have

906

27 of these in my collection all in the

907
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,690
different color eyeshadow stained in it

908
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:26,190
I love these for just laying down colors

909
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:28,320
and packing things into the outer corner

910
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:29,790
all you the I'm 433 we have the second

911
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,950

morphe for this collection and that is

913
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:36,360
the m45

914
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:38,100
six now this is literally the most

915
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:41,110
iconic blending burst of all time

916
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:43,240
because it is the m4 33s little

917
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:44,830
now we all know and love this brush like

918
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,370
I was thinking I have 27 of them in my

919
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:47,020
collection

920
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:48,460
this brush performs the exact same way

921
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,930
as its older sister being that it lays

922
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:52,630
down color and also blends it out at the

923
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:54,010
same time but it is so perfect people

924
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:55,450
that have smaller eyelids or if you want

925
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:56,620
to do little detail blending work and

926
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:58,420
don't want to get that color absolutely

927
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:59,650
everywhere you literally need this in

928
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:01,180
your collection and give me like two

929
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:04,210
weeks and I'll probably have 27 of these

930
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:05,560
as well we have the m22 for brush this

931
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:07,390
is just a small concealer brush that I

932
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:09,070
love for cutting the crease then we have

933
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:10,420
the a matte one six six I love this

934
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:12,160
brush for packing on a color after I

935
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:13,690
actually cut the crease we also had the

936
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:16,090
eyelet 1 to 4 which is kind of like the

937
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:17,080
baby sister to the m-16 6 I love this

938
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:18,790
brush for packing on either a

939
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,170
highlighter on the brow bone or what I'm

940
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:21,610
doing like sunset smokey eyes and I have

941
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:23,410
a lot of colors to pack all on the lid

942
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:24,910
and blend it together I love this for

943
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:26,230
topping on the shades this brush is

944
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:27,490
gonna be like your holy grail tool for

945
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:28,960
packing on those pressed pigments and

946
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:30,850
the actual palette to really get maximum

947
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,680
payoff we also have the m500 stick which

948
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:35,320
is like this tiny fluffy pointed a

949
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:36,730
tapered blending brush I love this are

950
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,290
going in the outer V and deepening up

951
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:40,780
with the crease region we also have the

952
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:42,760
tiny little ab 1 v 2 brush this is just

953
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:44,290
a tiny little fluffy packing brush it

954
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:46,120
may be very very small but it definitely

955
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:47,620
has some really important use I love

956
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:49,270
using this brush to blend in shadows on

957
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:51,430
the lower lash line we have the Abbott

958
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:52,780
251 brush this is the smallest liner

959
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:54,760
brush that morphe makes you can really

960
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:56,020
get an on fleek winged liner if you love

961
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:57,490
a good a gel liner

962
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:59,710
I lost probably not least we have the am

963
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:01,150
at 4:31 I love this tiny little pencil

964
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:03,370
brush for highlighting either at the tip

965
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:04,540
of my nose or my inner corners so those

966
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:06,100
are all the brushes all complete but

967
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:07,540
you're probably thinking what the heck

968
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:10,210
James you said this is the 34 piece

969
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:11,920
burst collection and it is what makes

970
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:13,510
this collection so iconic and perfect

971
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:16,120
for all my artists out there this has

972
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:17,380
never been done before but every single

973
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:20,230
one of the eye brushes that I hand

974
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:22,210
picked out for this collection comes the

975
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:24,850
duplicate just make it even better - at

976
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:27,220
the m-44 one at the M 4-3-3 and my new

977
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:28,570
baby brush the M 4.6 come with three

978
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:30,070
because why not

979
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:31,600
once I had the idea to actually create

980
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:33,310
this brush set for all artists and to

981
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,450
create duplicates as well and morphing

982
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:36,310
was on board I was so incredibly

983
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:37,930
grateful and excited to get started I

984
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:39,760
know so many guys out there are two

985
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:41,200
artists and work with color all the time

986
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,960
this is literally what my blending brush

987
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,130
table looks like so many colors so many

988
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,660
the same exact faulty brushes that I

989
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,830
know and love and that is why I wanted

990
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,940
to throw duplicates and there's to all

991
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:50,140
my artists out there can seamlessly

992
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:51,460
create the books that they want to

993
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:53,380
without having to stop and clean their

994
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:54,820
branches in between or they're having to

995
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:56,740
order a million different brushes all at

996
00:32:54,820 --> 00:33:00,400
