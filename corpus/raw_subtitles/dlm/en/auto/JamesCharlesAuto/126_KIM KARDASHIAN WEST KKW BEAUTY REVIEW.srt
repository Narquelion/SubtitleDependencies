13
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,230

00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,340
little video into a billion dollar

00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:36,930
empire her and her family they are by

world and I respect their business

19
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:42,660

00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,410

00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:51,629
is going to be a review and it is gonna

25
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:54,360
be completely and brutally honest no one

26
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:55,829
is safe not even sister Kim alright I'm

27
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,180
not rambling without further ado let's

28
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:59,280
go ahead and get on with the video

29
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,660
alright so before we actually hop in and

30
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,609
test out the contour six I do want to

31
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,809
apply a little bit of a base I was just

32
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:06,630
watching the Beauty tutorials on at

33
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:07,710
k'kaw calm with Kim and Mario and Kim

34
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,780
was definitely wearing a little bit of a

35
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,979
base when Mario did her makeup just for

36
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,659
a quick light based I'm gonna go ahead

37
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:15,299
and play the Giorgio Armani luminous sub

38
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:16,650
foundation in the shade 3.5 you guys

39
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:18,330
know if you follow me on Santa this is

40
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,070
actually not my favorite foundation I've

41
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,720
not had the best experience of this but

42
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,250
I do know Kim loves this and I want to

43
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,580
do my best to recreate her look as much

44
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,580
as possible

45
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,320
and I'm also just going to quickly

46
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:37,000
define my brows using my Anasazi

47
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,290
eyebrows in the shade medium brown just

48
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,560
to give a little bit more shape to my

49
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:40,560
face

50
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:50,390
all right so now that the base is all on

51
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,950
and I'm looking a little bit less pimply

52
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:54,020
and red let's go ahead and move on and

53
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:56,000
test out these contour sticks looking at

54
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:57,740
the k'kaw beauty website right now there

55
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,060
are four different sets that launched

56
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:00,950
and they are the cream contour

57
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:02,990
highlighting kits they're all sold out

58
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:05,420
so major congrats in camp but when they

59
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:07,700
were sold they did launch for $45 each

60
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:09,860
so for $45 you're actually getting two

61
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:11,360
different shades of contour stick two

62
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:13,340
different highlighters one being matte

63
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,350
and one being summery and a dual ended

64
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:16,760
brush one being a kabuki brush and one

65
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:18,710
being like a little sponge on the end so

66
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,240
honestly from $45 you're getting six

67
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:21,350
things now I obviously have not with

68
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,580
these on my face yet so I cannot really

69
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:24,560
tell you if it's worth it

70
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:26,300
but for the number of things are kidding

71
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,280
and the price definitely a pretty good

72
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:30,800
deal now the kids do come in four

73
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,690
different shades being light medium dark

74
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,910
and deep dark now four shades may not

75
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:36,230
seem like a lot but being at the actual

76
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:38,209
event yesterday and seeing them all in

77
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:40,280
person it goes from a really really

78
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:42,380
light to deep dark and trusted the deep

79
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,850
dark was actually pretty dark so that is

80
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:45,080
so awesome that Kim is not forgetting

81
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:47,810
about all the dark girls out there

82
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:49,370
because honestly they exist I have been

83
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:50,570
deciding between a light and medium but

84
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,760
for today's video I think I'm gonna be

85
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,840
actually using the medium kit y'all know

86
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,160
that I do like being a little bit more

87
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,870
bronzed and we're not trying to have

88
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,640
another flashback Mary moment so I'm

89
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:00,290
gonna be using the medium camp for today

90
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm gonna open up medium in just a

91
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:04,040
second but that does leave me with light

92
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,450
dark and deep dark to use and less

93
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,400
virile I am definitely not gonna be

94
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:08,630
using these two so I don't think want to

95
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,400
give them away to you guys because they

96
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:12,019
did sell out super fast so if anybody

97
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,250
one of these it wasn't able to get their

98
00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:14,630
hands on them make sure you get this

99
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,100
video a big thumbs up down below and

100
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:17,330
then leave me a comment and I will

101
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,250
definitely be picking a winner on

102
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:20,870
Monday's video to give these kits away

103
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:23,150
for you guys alright so let's go ahead

104
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:24,950
and open up the medium set and honestly

105
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:27,019
living through this packaging the new to

106
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:29,780
plastic bag is really really cute to be

107
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:31,370
honest I really really like it oh oh my

108
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,959
god okay so the products actually come

109
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:34,640
in an airtight sealed package as well

110
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,959
which is super awesome means they're

111
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,459
going to be fresh and definitely not

112
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:41,360
like damaged by the mail or anything so

113
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:42,769
that is amazing love her and don't love

114
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,760
the fact that I forgot to bring a pair

115
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:46,430
of scissors in okay

116
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:49,280
so okay so as promised this that comes

117
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:50,750
with two highlighting in contour six and

118
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,700
then a a brush as well so let's go ahead

119
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:54,470
and put these into at the test first and

120
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:56,540
things again the packaging is super cute

121
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:58,730
this is super cute this is also a lot

122
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:59,810
smaller than I expected - looking at the

123
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:01,400
Instagram post I thought this is gonna

124
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:03,049
be a whole lot bigger like I was

125
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,970
thinking like m-43 nine morphe saw a

126
00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:06,110
kabuki brush but I was definitely wrong

127
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:07,549
so I'm definitely curious to see how

128
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:09,230
this is actually gonna work on the face

129
00:04:07,549 --> 00:04:10,879
but I'm not gonna judge until we try

130
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:12,290
obviously so like I said I already have

131
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,340
a light base to foundation on so the

132
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:15,230
first thing I want to do is go into the

133
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:17,419
highlighting stick and I'm gonna open up

134
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:18,979
this end cracked with the matte

135
00:04:17,419 --> 00:04:20,449
highlighting shade and I'm gonna use

136
00:04:18,979 --> 00:04:22,400
this under the eyes just to brighten up

137
00:04:20,449 --> 00:04:23,690
the high points of my face so I guess

138
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,030
I'm just gonna go right and use like a

139
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:27,440
normal concealer oh okay this is much

140
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:30,710
softer than I was expecting

141
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,120
oh my god it was really really good this

142
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:33,410
form is honestly going on really really

143
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,729
nicely I'm just putting in all the high

144
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:36,500
points my face when I only put my

145
00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:37,910
concealer and then I'm just gonna try to

146
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,139
blend it in with the actual sponge to

147
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,850
see how it actually it blends together

148
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:43,039
rather the product is all and I'm just

149
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:44,180
gonna use the sponge to blend it and but

150
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:45,350
similar to a Beauty Blender I definitely

151
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,669
want to wet it so I'm just gonna spritz

152
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:48,949
it using my Tarte

153
00:04:46,669 --> 00:04:51,729
Ready Set radiant skin mist just to get

154
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:51,729
it a little wet

155
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:56,660
we're then just gonna go ahead and blend

156
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:58,490
her in okay woah so let me get this

157
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:01,010
close up this sponge definitely takes

158
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:02,210
off a lot of the products like I don't

159
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,800
know if you can see actually on camera

160
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:05,870
but my skin is definitely showing

161
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,550
thinners I don't know about this but I

162
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,960
think I wanted to have my face using the

163
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:10,460
sponge on the end of the brush and then

164
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,500
the other half using of my Beauty

165
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,550
Blender oh good idea James so then we

166
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,870
can see how they actually compare

167
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:20,210
because I want to give the product a

168
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:21,800
fair chance I just went ahead and I

169
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:22,880
apply it more matte highlighter to the

170
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,830
other side of my face that I use the

171
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,810
sponge on this is definitely a major

172
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:28,159
fail for me it's picking up a lot of the

173
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:29,990
product and it's just not letting out

174
00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:31,159
very very nicely but I haven't used the

175
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:32,870
Kabuki brush store and I get to this

176
00:05:31,159 --> 00:05:34,699
when we get to the contour but this bomb

177
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,960
is definitely not my favorite I am gonna

178
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:37,310
go ahead and use my Beauty Blender just

179
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,570
to blend everything else out though

180
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,889
because I want to get the product a fair

181
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:41,090
chance you haven't even gotten to see

182
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:44,510
what it looks like yet so let's go ahead

183
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:46,010
and wonder out all right there we go was

184
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,130
so much better oh my god

185
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:50,120
when in doubt beauty blend it out

186
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:51,199
alright so once that is all blended up

187
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,120
it is definitely looking really really

188
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,590
beautiful on the skin I'm thinking that

189
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,169
this was probably like a medium type

190
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:56,699
cover

191
00:05:55,169 --> 00:05:57,930
it definitely like even everything out

192
00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:00,030
and actually did a pretty good job of

193
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:01,379
covering my under-eye bags as well but

194
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:02,610
it definitely is like not full coverage

195
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:04,889
because I can still see my skin

196
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:06,810
underneath it but I do like that so this

197
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:08,370
is definitely a pretty good product so

198
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:09,569
far definitely does not like being the

199
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:11,219
sponge but I'm glad we went in with the

200
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:13,050
Beauty Blender because this is pretty

201
00:06:11,219 --> 00:06:14,099
bomb well get back to the shimmer end of

202
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:15,449
the highlighting SEC towards the end of

203
00:06:14,099 --> 00:06:17,460
the video but let's move on with the

204
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:19,590
contour so opening up the stick we have

205
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:21,090
a light contour end and a darker contour

206
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:23,009
and this is the medium stick keep in

207
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:24,479
mind and in the video that Kim posted

208
00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:26,009
she said she likes to use the lighter

209
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,270
end of the stick to do like her nose

210
00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:29,280
contour and sometimes even like

211
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:30,810
eyeshadow under and lower but she likes

212
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,129
to use the darker stick to contour the

213
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:33,780
rest of her face so we're gonna do the

214
00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:35,069
exact same thing today I'm first gonna

215
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:42,090
use the lighter end of the stick to it

216
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:43,379
snatch my nose I would like to contour

217
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:45,030
the bottom window so it kind of like

218
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:47,789
lifts it up and just gives it a little

219
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:48,840
bit of like a cute doll like a fact and

220
00:06:47,789 --> 00:06:50,129
you guys know that I definitely love a

221
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,169
good at pinch nose I'm putting these

222
00:06:50,129 --> 00:06:53,639
lines pretty close together

223
00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:55,199
okay I'm not just realizing that I

224
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:56,490
happen to use the darker under the

225
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,870
second way nose contour and not the

226
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:02,159
lighter atoms imagine if I like actually

227
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:05,789
paid attention took my time on something

228
00:07:02,159 --> 00:07:07,080
for three seconds okay okay so moving on

229
00:07:05,789 --> 00:07:08,669
looks fun with the contour and I'm first

230
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,099
gonna use the lighter end of the stick

231
00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:12,779
it's almost like a bronzer so just gonna

232
00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:14,909
put this in the hollows that only two

233
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:16,770
brings pretty far up as well on both

234
00:07:14,909 --> 00:07:18,300
sides and I'm just placing this right

235
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:20,400
underneath my cheekbone to really lift

236
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,659
it up and chisel it out and I'm also

237
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,490
gonna grab this lighter shaded I'm gonna

238
00:07:21,659 --> 00:07:27,930
put it right on the forehead because

239
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:30,419
y'all know that I hate my look as short

240
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:31,650
and small as possible next going back

241
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:34,199
into the darker and I'm going to use

242
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:36,270
this to really contour out the deepest

243
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:38,490
point that liam8 the very outside edge

244
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:42,509
of the forehead and then the very very

245
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:45,770
bottom of the cheekbones as well as the

246
00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:45,770
going to really

247
00:07:46,349 --> 00:07:50,289
all right so like I said this sponge was

248
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:52,330
definitely not my favorite but the

249
00:07:50,289 --> 00:07:53,710
Kabuki end is still here so they only

250
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:56,550
want to give this a shot and test it out

251
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:56,550
with the contour

252
00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:07,699
I'm not really sure who in their right

253
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:09,740
mind would ever contour their nose using

254
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:11,900
computers but that really did not do

255
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:18,770
that out of a job of blending it oh I am

256
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:20,689
gonna completely go back in with that I

257
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:22,009
definitely dip it a lot of contour as

258
00:08:20,689 --> 00:08:23,060
well so I am gonna go back into once

259
00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:25,009
again with the highlighting stick

260
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:28,279
underneath just to redefine it a little

261
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:29,449
bit oh my god yeah when you use the

262
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:32,570
Beauty Blender this literally blends out

263
00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:34,579
so nice and evenly like this looks so

264
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:36,079
freakin good okay so once this is all

265
00:08:34,579 --> 00:08:38,570
blended out this honestly does look

266
00:08:36,079 --> 00:08:40,010
really really really pretty similar to

267
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:42,649
the highlighting stick the contour stick

268
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:44,000
formula is bomb it blends out so

269
00:08:42,649 --> 00:08:45,380
beautifully and looks really really

270
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,149
natural on the skin which I love

271
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:48,260
definitely not full coverage but enough

272
00:08:47,149 --> 00:08:49,760
coverage to the point where like you get

273
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:52,040
the color there and it makes a beautiful

274
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,470
impact Ashley's like a Buki brush it's

275
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,850
not bad I am someone who never ever uses

276
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:57,440
brushes to blend out creams or

277
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:58,760
foundations I'm just not the type of

278
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,290
artist I really have never understand

279
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,760
when people do just because I feel like

280
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:03,050
kabuki brushes do always rub a

281
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,750
foundation it kind of makes things look

282
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:08,029
uneven that being said this did one out

283
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:09,500
really really nicely it honestly was not

284
00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:10,970
really rubbing off the foundation it

285
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,709
just went on really really beautifully

286
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:14,630
it applied nicely but I did have to

287
00:09:12,709 --> 00:09:16,160
really work at it so I kind of like do a

288
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:17,510
mixture of windshield wiper motions and

289
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,519
topping to make sure I wasn't lifting

290
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:20,990
anything up but once it was applied it

291
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,699
was definitely applied and looked nice

292
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:25,070
I'm just really not a brush type of

293
00:09:22,699 --> 00:09:27,769
person but you might be so definitely

294
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:31,370
check this out it's not bad this on the

295
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:32,360
other hand it's not great all right so

296
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,740
now that all the countries it's all

297
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,110
complete let's go ahead and get deep

298
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,370
glow on so for this we're gonna use

299
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,870
these shimmery pearl the highlighting

300
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:41,520
stick obviously let's go ahead and do a

301
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:45,330
little swatch on the hand

302
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:46,950
oh it actually looks really really

303
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:48,810
pretty that was like a very very subtle

304
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:50,010
not the lion dink low but that's

305
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:51,210
definitely what Kim was going for when

306
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:52,950
she was talking about this yesterday

307
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:54,540
definitely just like a glow from with

308
00:09:52,950 --> 00:10:02,040
Anna but let's see how she applies on

309
00:09:54,540 --> 00:10:07,709
the face I need to let pop her on in the

310
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:08,610
inner corners on the courts I have been

311
00:10:07,709 --> 00:10:10,080
loving putting a little bit of how

312
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:13,589
they're up here recently - for that like

313
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:18,810
to e4 hand block and then also on the

314
00:10:13,589 --> 00:10:20,100
cheekbone and then I'll just with you my

315
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:28,920
beauty butter and lately a blend this

316
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:31,260
out okay not bad as you can see it's

317
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,029
definitely pretty it's not blinding by

318
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:34,920
any means but I actually really really

319
00:10:33,029 --> 00:10:36,720
like this now don't get me wrong you

320
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,940
guys know I love I've got a blinding

321
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,260
highlight all the time but I think this

322
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,970
product is really really good for just

323
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:43,649
like the everyday person who just wants

324
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:46,110
to like look really moisturized radiant

325
00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:47,370
like glowing from within but doesn't

326
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:49,320
wanna look like they have 54 different

327
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:52,500
pounds of like metallic highlighting

328
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,790
glow pigment all over their face like I

329
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,589
said I haven't fallen camp for a very

330
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:58,200
very long time and we all know she used

331
00:10:55,589 --> 00:11:00,450
to pack on the makeup like full be full

332
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,250
contour full eye shadow glam highlight

333
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:04,350
to the gods but more recently she's been

334
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,970
rocking like the very very dewy natural

335
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:08,640
just moisturize skin look and I think

336
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:10,470
she looks so beyond beautiful so this

337
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,080
set is definitely like her new makeup

338
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:14,640
style packed into one set and I really

339
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,020
like that alright so now that all the

340
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,540
products are locked in and we're looking

341
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:20,130
nice and snatched in the video with kim

342
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,600
mario definitely recommended using a

343
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:23,550
light coat of setting powder just to set

344
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,660
everything in place and actually so

345
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,890
beyond stuff right now because i

346
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,270
completely forgot about the fact that

347
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:29,430
there is not an ounce of powder on my

348
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,690
face yet this is literally all liquid

349
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:32,100
foundation and then cream products

350
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,630
overtop but you guys know that I

351
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,850
definitely love packing on the powder a

352
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:37,980
lot but there's literally no powder on

353
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:39,950
my face in this books it's so beautiful

354
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:43,380
like there's no creasing it just looks

355
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:45,300
natural I'm honestly living for it oh my

356
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,160
god I'm just gonna do the lightest

357
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,750
dusting

358
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,820
just so if I touch my face it doesn't

359
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:51,170
like come right off or anything all

360
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,940
right so that is the base all complete

361
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:54,860
I'm honestly really really liking how

362
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:56,450
this looks so far and last but finally

363
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:58,100
not least in the videos Kim said she

364
00:11:56,450 --> 00:12:00,140
does use these for her eye shadow as

365
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,430
well so why not just try something out

366
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:03,200
let's just take a little bit from there

367
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,950
I don't have anywhere to go might as

368
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,170
well give it a shot

369
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:07,820
dropping the lighter under the condo SEC

370
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:12,050
I'm just gonna place this right on the

371
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:16,970
eyelid now nervous gonna use my fingers

372
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:18,110
to literally lightly blend this down and

373
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:19,520
then grabbing the darker and I'm gonna

374
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:21,650
go in the inner and outer corners to

375
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:24,320
kind of create a defined halo eye type

376
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:25,820
of of that and then once again just

377
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,000
having my fingers to it lightly blend it

378
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:30,320
out and then for a pop I'm gonna grab

379
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:37,580
the shimmery highlighter and I'm gonna

380
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:39,200
place it on the center of okay wow we

381
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:41,450
literally just created a bronzy halo eye

382
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,580
and the matter of like two minutes and

383
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:44,510
honestly it does not look half bad I'm

384
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:46,010
gonna go ahead and I'm gonna lock my

385
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:50,990
face in place using the Urban Decay all

386
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:51,380
nighter setting spray - the finished

387
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:52,280
look

388
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:54,260
all right so let's go ahead and talk

389
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:56,540
about these products all right so once

390
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:58,910
again the k'kaw beauty hiding contouring

391
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:01,310
cream set comes with two dual ended

392
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:04,910
contour six and another dual ended brush

393
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:06,230
and sponge contraption thingy as for the

394
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:07,730
holiday and contouring sticks they

395
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:09,350
definitely have like a medium level of

396
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:10,760
coverage they do a good job of like

397
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:12,830
evening everything out and just giving a

398
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,150
nice little defining moment but they are

399
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:16,310
overpowering to the point where you're

400
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:17,990
like full coverage hiding Impuls acne

401
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:19,430
and stuff like that you can still see

402
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:21,260
your natural skin underneath which I

403
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:22,520
personally like if you are a full

404
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:24,440
coverage type of person you can

405
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:26,780
definitely layer and build it up but

406
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,950
regardless they're bomb as for this

407
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:29,930
sister right here this was definitely

408
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:31,850
more of a Miss for me I'd really didn't

409
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:33,020
like the sponge it's definitely pretty

410
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:34,310
dense and I just was like it didn't do

411
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,810
that great of a job of really blending

412
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:37,070
off the product I felt as though it was

413
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:38,270
really removing the product rather than

414
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:40,340
actually blending it and that's

415
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:41,930
obviously never what we want is was a

416
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:44,030
kabuki brush and it actually went on a

417
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:45,350
very braid nicely I definitely was being

418
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:47,240
really really careful and had to work on

419
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:48,089
it a little bit more but when I was

420
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,410
doing it this down

421
00:13:48,089 --> 00:13:50,879
did a really great job of just flooding

422
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:51,990
up the product evenly and smoothly

423
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:53,610
without ripping off any of the

424
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:54,870
foundation which is really really great

425
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:56,730
because I definitely have a personal

426
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:58,110
vendetta against using brushes for

427
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:59,939
foundations but this obviously did a

428
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:01,110
really really great job I definitely

429
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:02,279
loved using the Beauty Blender to blend

430
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:03,720
these out it just did so much of a

431
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:05,730
better job but this definitely is not

432
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,959
bad by any means I just really did like

433
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:09,059
the sponge and I'm not really a brush

434
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,740
person but it's really not bad and that

435
00:14:09,059 --> 00:14:12,389
even being said obviously it's her first

436
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:14,579
launch her first collection these

437
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:15,600
products are brand spanking new so it's

438
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:17,879
not like everything's gonna be perfect

439
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,709
on the first try let's be real look at

440
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:21,029
sister Kylie for example so many things

441
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:22,350
went wrong on the first launch but now

442
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:24,059
after many many launches and new

443
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:25,949
products she arguably has some of the

444
00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:27,149
best on the market so I definitely it's

445
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:28,589
gonna take a lot of launches and stuff

446
00:14:27,149 --> 00:14:30,839
to Kim to get everything perfect but

447
00:14:28,589 --> 00:14:31,740
definitely a really really great star do

448
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:34,740
I think this collection is worth

449
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:36,029
checking out for $45 absolutely even if

450
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,589
you exclude the blending tool you're

451
00:14:36,029 --> 00:14:39,089
still getting four different shades of

452
00:14:37,589 --> 00:14:41,579
highlighting and contouring sticks for

453
00:14:39,089 --> 00:14:42,839
only $45 I think that is so Bob

454
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:44,249
especially being associated with a

455
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,449
celebrity name like Kim Kardashian

456
00:14:44,249 --> 00:14:47,069
