00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,600
hi sisters james charles here and

00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,799
welcome back to my youtube channel as

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,080
you guys can see right now i have no

4
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,600
makeup on and that is because

5
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,800
today's video is actually going to be

6
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,320
quite a little bit different but i'm

7
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,759
honestly excited to try something new

8
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,280
out with you guys and i really hope that

9
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,960
you enjoy it i don't know if any of you

10
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,920
have seen it but gq does a really cool

11
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,600
series on their youtube channel with

12
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,359
different celebrities called 10 things

13
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,480
that blank cannot live without and so

14
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,400
many my favorite people have done it

15
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,080
such as magnum stallion and nick jonas

16
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,279
phineas shawn mendes has done it pretty

17
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,039
much like literally everybody and

18
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,960
basically the series name could honestly

19
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,560
not be any more self-explanatory

20
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,840
guests just go on and literally showcase

21
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,120
10 different items that they cannot live

22
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,719
without but a lot of people that have

23
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,239
done the show's list have contained like

24
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,760
kind of more obvious things like their

25
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,200
phone family members their dog or their

26
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,559
favorite snacks and obviously those are

27
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,840
all items that i could not live without

28
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,600
either i wanted to make it a little bit

29
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,120
more fun and i wanted to show you guys

30
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,640
10 different things that i have found

31
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,520
while online shopping that i didn't know

32
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,680
that i needed

33
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,719
that now i cannot live without hope so

34
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:58,640
without further ado

35
00:00:50,719 --> 00:01:00,239
let's get started

36
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,600
okay you guys so i have so many products

37
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,199
i found me today that i'm so excited to

38
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,040
show you some of them are really weird

39
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,320
some of them are really really cool and

40
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,159
because i'm a beauty guru i really

41
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,840
wanted to focus on non-makeup related

42
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,400
items for today's video to keep it

43
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,680
interesting

44
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,520
but i did want to start off this list

45
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,479
with only one thing that i really

46
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,720
recommend you guys

47
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,320
try and that is the mario badescu

48
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,840
drawing lotion now this isn't a makeup

49
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,280
product it's more of a skincare type of

50
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,240
situation if any of you guys suffer with

51
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,600
acne out there

52
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,200
this has literally become like my

53
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,799
favorite product in the entire world

54
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,240
obviously i'm not a skincare expert i am

55
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,920
not haram you definitely should check

56
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,280
him out if you guys need any skincare

57
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,720
advice and just because this works for

58
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,159
me does not mean that it'll work for you

59
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,600
but i just wanted to show it anyway for

60
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,439
anybody out there who may suffer with

61
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,840
acne just like i do as you guys can see

62
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,280
i have

63
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,119
quite a large breakout going on right

64
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,560
now on my chin and on my forehead as

65
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:44,399
well this stuff works really really well

66
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,720
to dry out and minimize the appearance

67
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,880
of

68
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,960
pimples overnight so basically all i do

69
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,479
is just grab a little q-tip like this

70
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,320
dip it into the bottle and then i'll

71
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,960
just put a dollop of the product

72
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,560
right over top of any breakouts usually

73
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,280
i put on however many dots i need let

74
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,560
them dry down

75
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,680
then go to sleep and wipe them off in

76
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,119
the morning when i wake up and it

77
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,799
definitely does help reduce the redness

78
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,000
and the size of the pimples it usually

79
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,600
does not get rid of them from me i

80
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,960
should clarify that as well

81
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,239
but this really really does help and i

82
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,759
would definitely recommend any of you

83
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,120
guys out there oh this is also probably

84
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,640
a good time to mention too none of the

85
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,920
items in this video today are sponsored

86
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,959
i'm not being paid to promote any of

87
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,959
this stuff in any way

88
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,400
shape or form and i truly do love them

89
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,239
and just wanted to share this for a fun

90
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,440
little video today however there are

91
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,480
links in the description box down below

92
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,200
if you guys want to get any of these

93
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,720
things and they

94
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,080
are affiliate links so i just wanted to

95
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,280
be transparent with you guys the next

96
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,680
item that i want to show you guys

97
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,800
also relates to a drawing and it is this

98
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,720
right here which is a

99
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,920
portable battery operated fan you

100
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,080
literally just click the button

101
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,599
and then it has three different speeds

102
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,599
and like uh

103
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:43,120
speeds and strengths would you call it

104
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,800
intensity sure it has three different

105
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,519
speeds and intensities if you will and

106
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,879
this third speed

107
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,480
let me tell you is actually producing

108
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,160
quite a lot of air this is actually one

109
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,000
of my newer additions to my things that

110
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,200
i cannot live without list but oh my god

111
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,319
i cannot believe that i didn't actually

112
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,840
buy this sooner this is

113
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,360
literally everything i always have it

114
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,720
next to me on my filming desk one

115
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,599
because it gets very hot in here but

116
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,200
also it helps

117
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,879
so much when it comes to drying setting

118
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,480
spray or if you have lashes then you

119
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,159
need to dry your lash glue just pop your

120
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,640
fan on literally this has come in

121
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,239
so so so handy also you can travel with

122
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,840
it too so when it's a million degrees

123
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,519
here in california because it has been a

124
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,760
heat wave recently you know that this is

125
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,440
in

126
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,879
my purse okay so speaking of things that

127
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,000
i'm carrying inside of my purse the next

128
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,920
item that i want to show you guys

129
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,080
is arguably the thing that i use most on

130
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,599
this entire list and that is this baby

131
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,400
right here which literally looks like a

132
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,760
brick

133
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,519
but it is my anchor power or

134
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,799
anchor portable charger it comes in a

135
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,159
box just like this and i think that this

136
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,599
one is the 26

137
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:37,200
800 milli amps megawatts some sort of

138
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,480
electricity power measurement i have

139
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,159
literally no idea what it is i will

140
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,159
clarify for you guys these are

141
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,519
very very expensive but you don't

142
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,879
necessarily have to get one this strong

143
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,640
they do have several other versions as

144
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,000
well that are much more affordable this

145
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,360
has literally been like one of the best

146
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,080
investments that i have ever made i

147
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,319
carry this with me

148
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,560
literally every single place that i go

149
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:57,200
because this keeps my phone alive

150
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,959
like literally forever this holds like

151
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,200
70 million charges in this and is

152
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,519
actually insane

153
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,799
70 million charges yeah sure basically

154
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,400
you just leave this plugged in overnight

155
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,120
so it can get fully charged up and then

156
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,799
there are three

157
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,400
usb slots right here that you can plug

158
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,360
your phone charger into so you can

159
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,280
charge your own phone

160
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,400
and two other devices at the same time

161
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,959
which is so lit

162
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,320
these have saved my life so so many

163
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,120
times now to go along with your portable

164
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,400
charger the next

165
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,440
that i want to show you guys is one that

166
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:26,000
most of us probably already have but

167
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,520
not this version and that is a 10 foot

168
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,120
power cable now you probably already

169
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,400
know this and a lot smarter than me but

170
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,240
there was a point in time where i

171
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,840
unfortunately was convinced that the

172
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,479
only place you could actually get iphone

173
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,880
chargers

174
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,479
was from apple which is so stupid i know

175
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,320
but just in case you didn't know that it

176
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,080
is in fact incorrect and you can get

177
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,759
really really cheap chargers that are so

178
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,680
good on like amazon for like

179
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,919
six dollars and not only is this one

180
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,199
cheap it's also 10 feet long which is

181
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,639
literally the most convenient thing in

182
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,840
the entire world so you can have your

183
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,680
phone plugged in literally

184
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,040
anywhere and be able to walk around with

185
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,280
it plug it into an outlet that might be

186
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,960
in an

187
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,800
inconvenient location and still be able

188
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,639
to charge your phone or you can plug it

189
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,000
into your portable charger in your purse

190
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,520
and walk around with it you can put it

191
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
in your backpack at school and be able

192
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,360
to

193
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,880
loop it around and hold in your hands i

194
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,080
don't even know literally nobody in this

195
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,840
house anymore is wasting

196
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,880
thirty dollars on three foot apple

197
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,639
cables that are definitely going to

198
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,919
break or get lost i do not regret this

199
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,520
in any way shape or

200
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,800
form okay so the next thing that i want

201
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,560
to show you guys is another one of those

202
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,199
items that is in my purse literally at

203
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,720
all times

204
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,000
some people actually might already know

205
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,520
about this but i've also met a lot of my

206
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,960
friends who had no idea so i definitely

207
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,639
want to show all of you today and that

208
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,440
is this right here which is called a

209
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,479
tile now if you open a box basically it

210
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,960
is like these little

211
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,320
plastic cubes and this right here is a

212
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,600
tracking device you can buy them

213
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,199
individually but you can also buy them

214
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,479
in sets of i think two four

215
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,919
six and eight obviously right here i

216
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,280
have my set of four and two of them are

217
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,800
missing but i have like ten more of

218
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,560
these boxes upstairs because i have

219
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,919
so many of these tiles because they have

220
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,360
literally saved my

221
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,280
life they look just like this they're

222
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,960
very small square and thin and i think

223
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,080
they also come in black or white they

224
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,600
have a little hole in it so you can put

225
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,720
it on a keychain but they're also thin

226
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,319
enough to where you can literally put it

227
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,360
anywhere so i have one in my wallet i

228
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,039
also have one in my

229
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,880
backpack in my suitcase and also

230
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,400
literally every single purse that i own

231
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,400
and then you sync them up to your phone

232
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,520
on an app just like this basically all

233
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,800
you have to do is

234
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,639
register your different items so right

235
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,080
here like i have my louis vuitton wallet

236
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,000
oh speaking of this charger i need to

237
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,039
use it because my phone is dying period

238
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,560
and then it'll tell you the tiles

239
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,840
location so obviously right now it says

240
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,919
nearby because my wallet is

241
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:21,360
right here in my very hand and if you

242
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:23,199
click find on the app

243
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,639
the tile will start ringing which is so

244
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,000
beyond helpful if you lose your wallet

245
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,280
within your own house or if it falls

246
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,960
between your couch cushions or under

247
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,319
your car seat all you do is click find

248
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,919
and it'll ring right away

249
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,600
but if your item with your tie liner is

250
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,280
not nearby if you happen to

251
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,039
lose it it will tell you the exact

252
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,199
location was last seen which is

253
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,400
so incredibly helpful i have lost this

254
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,160
way more times that i would like to

255
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,919
admit in fact i literally lost my wallet

256
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,039
two days ago my tesla was in the shop so

257
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,880
i had to get a rental

258
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,319
car and i accidentally left this in

259
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,840
there when we gave it back which was

260
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,720
a really really stupid mistake and i

261
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,919
couldn't find it i was looking

262
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,360
everywhere throughout the house then i

263
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,280
was thinking oh my god let me check my

264
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,479
tile and low behold it was at the tesla

265
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,240
service center and they drove it back to

266
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,680
me right away which was super super nice

267
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,280
but literally without this i would have

268
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,479
never probably seen this again like i

269
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,199
said i have this in literally every

270
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,039
single bag

271
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,280
purse suitcase that i own and it has

272
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,680
made things so much easier to keep track

273
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,960
of

274
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,400
although i've lost my wallet a bunch of

275
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,160
times like an absolute idiot the one

276
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,639
item that i never lose or misplace has

277
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,880
got to be

278
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,319
my iphone actually fun fact for you

279
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,960
though if i did happen to lose it you

280
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,280
can also

281
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,720
tap on your tile and it'll start ringing

282
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,199
oh hello

283
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,840
there you go oh my god it'll start

284
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,599
ringing your phone

285
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,960
just like this which has also come in

286
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:30,560
very very handy

287
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:34,160
shut up stop again stop

288
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:36,720
i know it's right here stop ringing

289
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,479
i know i have you in my hand but as i

290
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,840
was saying okay i never lose my iphone

291
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,360
and that has got to be because it is

292
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,960
literally locked my hand at all times

293
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,319
using a pop socket now i feel like

294
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,759
everyone in the entire world knows about

295
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,039
a popsocket and also has this on their

296
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,560
phone so i'm not going to be including

297
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,000
that in today's video but the one item

298
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,840
that i do want to include

299
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,319
that goes along with these pop sockets

300
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,000
is this right here it is a pop

301
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,319
socket holder now this probably looks

302
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,319
really stupid to you guys but these are

303
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,840
so incredibly useful it is not even

304
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,199
funny and i have so many of these lying

305
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,479
around my house and i wanted to take one

306
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,440
out and show you guys just how they work

307
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,440
today because

308
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,960
i accidentally happened to break mine a

309
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,360
few days ago so i ordered a bunch of new

310
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,479
ones

311
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,160
this is nothing revolutionary or

312
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,520
groundbreaking in any way shape or form

313
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,560
it is literally just like a round piece

314
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,599
of plastic with a little bit of sticky

315
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,840
tape on the back but

316
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,360
these come in so handy because all you

317
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,639
do is just place this somewhere where

318
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,560
you want to have your phone so you can

319
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,639
get work done hands-free so

320
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,479
the one that broke i always have stuff

321
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,319
to my mirror where i do my makeup so i

322
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,840
literally put it on here

323
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,759
just like this and it'll literally stick

324
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,279
anywhere oh

325
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,880
so while i'm sitting here at the studio

326
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,800
i can put my phone right here on my

327
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,399
makeup mirror so i can keep focusing on

328
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,000
getting glam but at the same time i can

329
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,760
make a facetime call if i need to this

330
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,760
is literally so helpful i also have one

331
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,240
of these on the dashboard of my car i 1

332
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,080
000

333
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,440
would never ever ever condone texting

334
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,320
while driving but it's super helpful to

335
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,080
have your phone right there if you need

336
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,399
to make any phone calls hands-free

337
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,440
or for gps directions as well okay so

338
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,560
while we're on the subject of things

339
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,760
that can hold your phone

340
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,279
the next item that i want to show you

341
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,640
guys is honestly something that i use

342
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,560
every single day and has

343
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,399
changed my life for the better and that

344
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,560
has got to be this little iphone

345
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,080
tripod ring light thing right here that

346
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,040
i got from amazon now i think this one

347
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,640
was like 60

348
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,080
which is definitely on the pricier side

349
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,600
but there are so many of them

350
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,519
online that i would definitely recommend

351
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,279
checking out and these are so

352
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,800
so helpful it is not even funny

353
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,720
basically they come just like this it is

354
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,240
a ring light a thing that can expand to

355
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,279
hold your phone no matter what size it

356
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,640
is and then a

357
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,640
expandable and collapsible

358
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,560
tripod this is like literally the

359
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,440
perfect all-in-one item for any form of

360
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,720
content creation

361
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,480
personally i like to use these whenever

362
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,600
i'm filming my tick tock videos but

363
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,880
this could be good if you want to film

364
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,160
different youtube videos if you want to

365
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,920
rotate it horizontally

366
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,959
for instagram videos for taking selfies

367
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,000
of yourself because it comes with a

368
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,440
remote as well

369
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,560
i think at this point i have like two or

370
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,839
three of these sitting around the house

371
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,279
for different tick tocks or videos and

372
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,880
stuff but at the hype house they

373
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,640
literally have like 97

374
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,080
okay not 97 books like they literally

375
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,000
have one of these in every single room

376
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,880
because they are so so helpful and i

377
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,080
would definitely recommend checking

378
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,600
these out if you were any sort of

379
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,399
content creator the next item that i

380
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,880
want to show you guys

381
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,680
is not a phone holder in any way shape

382
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,480
or form but

383
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,760
it is what we use it for just bear with

384
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,200
me for a quick second okay you guys

385
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,800
obviously saw the house for a video and

386
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,240
you saw the massive pool in the back

387
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,680
it has been very very hot this entire

388
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,399
summer of california and we have been in

389
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,480
it literally

390
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,839
non-stop swimming and just chilling in

391
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,360
the water which has been absolutely

392
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,760
incredible and one thing that we have

393
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,279
gotten

394
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,959
from amazon that has changed our lives

395
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:22,320
for the better is this

396
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:26,640
right here which is a float a floaty

397
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:28,560
a floaty yeah a floaty

398
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,600
tray we're gonna change the lighting for

399
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,800
one quick second so you guys can

400
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,680
actually see this but it is literally

401
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,160
just a white

402
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,600
floating trap but it has raised a border

403
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,720
so it's really really hard to sink or

404
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,839
get water inside

405
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,880
it comes in a pack of three and

406
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,160
technically these are supposed to be

407
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,000
used for serving food

408
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,920
but we use these smaller ones to put our

409
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,440
phones in so therefore we can enjoy our

410
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,079
time in the water but if we get a ding a

411
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,680
notification

412
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,040
or a phone call and we have to answer it

413
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,399
we can easily grab it without having to

414
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,920
worry about getting our phones wet

415
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,519
or reaching over the sides i know this

416
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,360
is like very very like first world

417
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,560
type of problem but these are coming

418
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,360
very very handy and anybody out there

419
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,800
who has a pool

420
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,399
might love this as well so i just wanted

421
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,600
to share in this video

422
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,440
this next item that i want to show you

423
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,040
guys is 150

424
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,560
of purchase that i made because of tick

425
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,399
tock but it has been so

426
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,079
so much fun to have and i do not regret

427
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,360
buying it and that is this baby right

428
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:14,160
here which is a

429
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,880
uh like star it is like a star light

430
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,320
projector

431
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,519
basically you plug it in you put it in

432
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,279
the center of your room and you turn

433
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,920
your lights off and it creates the most

434
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,920
beautiful

435
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,519
gorgeous like blue galaxy lighting all

436
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,920
over your ceiling in your room and it is

437
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,120
such a cool vibe whether it be late at

438
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,800
night and you're chilling in your room

439
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,959
or for even a party as well

440
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,839
obviously not during the pandemic this

441
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,680
would be so

442
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,279
so helpful and also this is what i used

443
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,800
to film my euphoria transformation tik

444
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,519
tok a few weeks ago as well and if you

445
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,200
guys saw that

446
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,000
it really looked super super cool so i

447
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,279
would definitely recommend checking

448
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,399
these out they are such a vibe

449
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,839
there's quite a lot of brands that are

450
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,519
like capitalizing on this right now and

451
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,600
selling these for like 120

452
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,880
which is absolutely ridiculous you can

453
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,639
get this on amazon for like

454
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,680
20 bucks so if you want to get it get it

455
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,040
for cheap there's literally no

456
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,680
difference in the quality at all and

457
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,279
this works

458
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,720
really great okay you guys so the next

459
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,600
and final two items on the list are

460
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,839
definitely two

461
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,800
that are like 18 not 18 up but

462
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,639
definitely two that you need to be

463
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,600
careful with i'll say that for sure and

464
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,279
the first one that i want to show you

465
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,839
guys is this right here which is an

466
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,959
electric

467
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,320
lighter this might seem like it's

468
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,680
something that is so ridiculous to you

469
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,760
but i really like these

470
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,800
one because plastic lighters are just

471
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,079
like a waste of

472
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,959
materials that are gross and you have to

473
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,160
throw them out because they don't get

474
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,000
many uses whereas this

475
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,000
can recharge so you can keep using it

476
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,399
literally forever and it's honestly just

477
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,120
like

478
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:26,160
kind of fun to play with it's a little

479
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,760
electric oh my god that's crazy looking

480
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,600
oh it literally creates an electrical

481
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,120
current so let's raise that back up

482
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,880
that's scary-looking so if i open up my

483
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,160
crisp morning air candle just like this

484
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,560
power it on and then if i hit my little

485
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,399
button

486
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,839
i can light it super super easily just

487
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,360
like that so once it runs out you just

488
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,440
plug it in and then it'll be ready to go

489
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,639
lighting things up again please be

490
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,320
careful and smart whatever you're

491
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,839
deciding to light on fire it'll never

492
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,920
run out of lighter fluids and it's also

493
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,680
not a waste of plastic and materials so

494
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,519
definitely recommend checking these out

495
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,480
if you want to okay you guys i've showed

496
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,920
you a ton of my favorite things

497
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,720
throughout this video so far

498
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,040
but the number 10 last item on my list

499
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,959
is

500
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,040
not only thing that i use every day but

501
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,440
something that i use probably 50 times a

502
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,680
day

503
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,639
and that is this baby right here which

504
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,560
is an electric

505
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,839
fly swatter now when i tell you that

506
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,200
this thing has changed my life and the

507
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,519
lives of everybody around me

508
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,120
oh my god i have made so many people

509
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,720
order this and not a single person

510
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,399
including myself has regretted this

511
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,079
because these are so

512
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,760
much fun it's not even funny basically

513
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,519
it looks like a tennis racket just like

514
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,040
this but it has a button on the side

515
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,800
and if you press on it it looks like

516
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,639
nothing's happening but oh

517
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,399
let me tell you something is happening

518
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,320
in here and i will tell you what it is

519
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,079

why don't we just continue the video and

532
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,839

in literally everybody's houses and this

535
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,800
is a really fun way to just zap them and

536
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,480
get rid of them and also scare off their

537
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,199

alright you guys and i think that

553
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,199
officially completes my list of the 10

554
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,839
different random gadgets and gizmos and

555
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,760
objects and

556
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,199
fun things that i could not live without

557
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,399
