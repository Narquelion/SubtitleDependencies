00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840

back IG Channel oh my god it feels

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,350
literally so good to be sitting here and

4
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,639
filming it in front of this camera right

5
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,679
now I know you guys have obviously been

6
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,240
seeing videos for me all the time but

7
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:13,380
they were actually all pre filmed

8
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,480
because I've been to traveling and just

9
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,220
working on a lot of super awesome and

10
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,010
secret things the past few days which

11
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,330
has been so so so exciting you guys are

12
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,500
literally not ready for the things that

13
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,350
are about to come with The Sisterhood

14
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,900
but regardless in case you cannot hear I

15
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,250
am very sister sick right now I just

16
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,570
traveled to a Vegas in Salt Lake City

17
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,730
this past weekend of a good friend at

18
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,370
lips like Nick for her makeup tour but I

19
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:37,050
got very very sick which is so

20
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,390
inconvenient and so rude and so

21
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,739
homophobic but I've been downing mucinex

22
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,930
and don't stop and awesome and blowing

23
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:45,000
my nose every 15 seconds Thank You

24
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,559
Kleenex hashtag not sponsored but

25
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,320
hopefully we'll be gone soon

26
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,000
and if you already hated my voice get

27
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,559
ready for this video because this is

28
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,789
about to be intense since I literally

29
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,050
have not had makeup on in over a week

30
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:56,730
now and knowing that blowing my nose

31
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:59,010
would take off my nose contour in about

32
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,270
three seconds flat I really just want to

33
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,010
sit down today I play with a little bit

34
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,780
of makeup I have a really pretty look in

35
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,070
mind inspired by a bum of a Mitchell I

36
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,020
saw The Times Instagram page and I was

37
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,970
like wow any this on my face right now

38
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,560
so we're just gonna chill I want to do a

39
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,549
little bit of a sister Q&A as well

40
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,229
because I haven't done one in a while

41
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:15,060
and for videos that I'm doing these more

42
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:16,470
colorful creative looks doing a juicy

43
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,939
Q&A during that was literally the only

44
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,350
way that I can guarantee it'll still get

45
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:21,869
views and you guys will still watch so

46
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:28,200
love being a bargaining Queen let's jump

47
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:29,850
into the video all right guys just

48
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,290
something right and this question is

49
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,460
actually a really good one to start off

50
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,229
with that I'm really gonna think about

51
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,840
here but this is from a sister owed Ron

52
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:40,170
and he said if you couldn't be convicted

53
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,299
of any one type of crime what criminal

54
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:45,000
charge would you want to be immune to

55
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:48,540
that is such a good question if I could

56
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,780
be immune to any criminal

57
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:53,939

sister Nika ass what's one thing wrongly

78
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:38,220
did in your makeup routine before you're

79
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,780
a professional makeup artist that you

80
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,150
would say to your younger self right now

81
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,550
when you have all this knowledge oh my

82
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:46,500
god 100 percent will be stop using so

83
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:48,570
much powder while baking your face

84
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,820
clearly you guys know flash like Mary

85
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:52,920
happened for a reason and it's because I

86
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:54,480
used to use literally so much baking

87
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,580
powder it's absolutely insane like I

88
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,290
used to pack it on with a powder puff

89
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:00,570
not even a beauty blender and it looked

90
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:02,160
so bad and not only did I look very very

91
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:03,660
textured but it also created one of my

92
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,920
biggest scandals of all time which thank

93
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:07,380
God I was able to turn it into a meme

94
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,730
and make it productive for me but oh my

95
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,900
god it was really really embarrassing in

96
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,130
the moment I feel like a lot of people

97
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,840
who watch beauty gurus for makeup

98
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:14,010
education including myself this is

99
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,910
totally how I learned how to do makeup

100
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:17,010
in the first place

101
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:18,930
tend to follow exactly what a lot of us

102
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:20,880
do and implement those steps into like

103
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:22,260
their everyday makeup routines literally

104
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,640
once again that's how you learn to do

105
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,600
makeup in the first place obviously you

106
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,830
should support and watch whatever you

107
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,050
want and whoever you find entertaining

108
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:29,280
duh but when it comes to actually

109
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:30,720
listening to the tips and advice and

110
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,850
implement take different products and

111
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,930
techniques into your routine I would say

112
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:36,480
that it's really really important to

113
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:38,910
find a guru or one or two who have very

114
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,800
very similar features and skin types to

115
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:42,300
because people like Patrick Starr for

116
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,550
example who use a million pounds of

117
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,840
pressed powder may sit there and say yes

118
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:47,370
baked your face bake your face bake your

119
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,200
face but for those people who want a

120
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:51,000
really really dry skin if you do that

121
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,739
you will look like the Sahara frickin

122
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,209
desert and then on the flip side there's

123
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:56,040
a lot of gurus out there such as icarly

124
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:57,540
by Bell or Jocelyn Hill who have more

125
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,340
normal to dry skin and they don't really

126
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,989
set their face much at all except for

127
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,270
underneath their eyes and for people who

128
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:04,590
have oily skin if you did that your face

129
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:06,150
would be melting off at about thirty

130
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:08,160
seconds flat after walking outside with

131
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:09,690
no pressed powder on so it's really a

132
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,980
matter of finding different people that

133
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:12,840
you not only like and find entertaining

134
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:14,400
to watch but also are able to give you

135
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,470
accurate techniques that are going to

136
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,910
work for you I definitely say for me I

137
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:19,260
wish I took my skin type into

138
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:21,030
consideration more when learning how to

139
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,560
kind of set my face in place we would

140
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:24,540
have avoided klaustreich mariya but

141
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,000
at least we got a really iconic meme out

142
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:28,350
of it Mariah asks how did you grow so

143
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,420
fast in the beauty industry

144
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:33,180
what's your secret / method you use to

145
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:34,320
get noticed / stay notice this is

146
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,790
actually a really good question that I

147
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,810
get asked all the time I've kind of

148
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:38,400
briefly touched on this in a few

149
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:40,230
different videos but you guys know I

150
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,950
love giving business advice and it's

151
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,990
like my favorite thing in the entire

152
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:44,730
world so I thought I would answer this

153
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:46,260
one today I think the reason that I did

154
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:47,490
grow so fast in the beauty industry it's

155
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:49,050
because of the looks that I started off

156
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:50,190
doing and I don't want to talk about me

157
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,480
being creative because I literally feel

158
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,010
like I talk about that in every video at

159
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,510
this point I think that originality is

160
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:56,550
really what grooming to begin with and

161
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:57,840
is what's kept me relevant up until this

162
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:59,250
day I'm definitely someone who can take

163
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,930
pride in the fact that I do create a lot

164
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:02,130
of really really original concepts for

165
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,180
my channel that I've been started a lot

166
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:05,160
of other people and a lot of other

167
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,480
creators as well and I just worked

168
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,830
really hard to come up with new concepts

169
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,330
the whole time I'd like the makeup

170
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,590
industry its kind of hit a wall in the

171
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:12,210
sense that we've literally all seen

172
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:13,860
everything done like a million times are

173
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:15,030
like every single eyeshadow palette that

174
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,919
comes out I feel like is looking exactly

175
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:18,150
the same like every single week there's

176
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:19,229
a new challenge coming out that feels

177
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,760
like one of the other challenges that

178
00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:21,960
we've all seen I think what set me apart

179
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,520
from a lot of different influences that

180
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,960
I was doing something different and

181
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,430
that's always the advice that I give to

182
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,169
up-and-coming artists or people who want

183
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:29,370
to build a social media page is that you

184
00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:30,330
have to do something different you have

185
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,940
to do thing that's gonna set yourself

186
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:34,110
apart from everybody else with a little

187
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,669
bit of glam and a little bit of face

188
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,830
tune who's doing the same exact thing

189
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:39,270
because as blunt as it sounds

190
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:40,890
nobody's ever gonna make it with some

191
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:42,630
brown smokey eyes and some nude lips

192
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:44,070
like it sounds harsh to say that but at

193
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:46,020
the end of the day there's a million

194
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:47,250
other people doing it so the only people

195
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,990
who are really succeeding and who are

196
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,220
gaining quickly are the ones who are

197
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:51,419
really setting themselves apart and

198
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,940
establishing themselves as both an

199
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:54,360
entertainer and an artist if that makes

200
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,250
sense

201
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,770
I also callate - if you go into the

202
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:00,510
industry trying to grow and trying to

203
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:02,010
gain followers and that's your reasoning

204
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:03,780
behind doing the makeup in the first

205
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:05,220
place you're never gonna make it because

206
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,570
it's gonna be really really obvious and

207
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,550
apparent to the people that are gonna be

208
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:10,050
following you whereas if you go into it

209
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:12,030
really focusing on your art and like I

210
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:13,200
said putting out a new original content

211
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:14,910
that nobody's seen before

212
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,900
the followers gonna come no matter what

213
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:17,039
because it's gonna be something

214
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,539
interesting that they're gonna want to

215
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,590
keep watching so I feel like you really

216
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:21,090
have to go into it with the different

217
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:22,650
lenses that everybody else and kind of

218
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:24,450
think like what can I bring to this

219
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:25,830
industry that doesn't already exist here

220
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:27,240
and it's gonna be those people who

221
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:29,010
really think outside of the box and

222
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,750
think strategically that are gonna make

223
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:32,280
it to the top a strass where have you

224
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:34,540
always wanted to go but never been able

225
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,340

the kind best celebrity you ever met Wow

271
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:03,610
can't wait to answer this one because I

272
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,500
know it won't get me in twist

273
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:07,600
accountable but I probably actually have

274
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,340
to say Kim Kardashian hands down she's

275
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,690
been absolutely incredible every single

276
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:12,790
time that I met her she definitely has a

277
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:14,380
little bit of a controversial public

278
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:15,970
figure but she doesn't let that get to

279
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:18,190
her and she's just really really funny

280
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:19,750
she's unapologetically herself and she's

281
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:21,370
a really really smart businesswoman and

282
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,510
she's just really really nice all on top

283
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:24,370
of that and has always been nothing but

284
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:26,050
absolutely amazing I would really love

285
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:29,230
to work with her one day so I definitely

286
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:29,890
love it sister Kim handsome easy answer

287
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:31,150
for that one

288
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:32,530
all right guys I'm currently baking in

289
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,490
the oven I'm gonna go into my brows

290
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:35,260
off-camera

291
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:37,810
sorry I literally cannot talk while

292
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:38,979
doing them I need to focus so hard core

293
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:41,020
to make sure the eyebrows end up being

294
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:42,500
sensors and not like distant cousins

295
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,300
twice root because

296
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,440
it happens let's be real so I'll be

297
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,300
right back in a few minutes to start off

298
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,530
the eyes so starting on behinds today

299
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,000
like I said I'm doing a look inspired by

300
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:52,490
a mobile of Mitchell one of my all-time

301
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,930
favorite artists and he's a UK artist

302
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,850
and UK artist use a lot of very

303
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:57,890
different techniques than ask American

304
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:59,780
and us artists and their eye shadow

305
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:00,920
always looks away a bomber than ours so

306
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,810
I definitely want to try a lot of the

307
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:05,150
different techniques today so I'm gonna

308
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:07,700
start off with the P Louise eyeshadow

309
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:09,380
base this is a kind of similar textures

310
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:11,480
like the mac prolongwear concealer and

311
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:13,850
I'm just going to Pat this on using a a

312
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:16,040
flat concealer brush and then for my eye

313
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:18,170
shadow today I'm gonna be using the P

314
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,160
Louise I shut up palette apparently

315
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:20,720
instead of really blending this in

316
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:23,360
you're supposed to kind of a tap it in

317
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,710
to place and what really is scaring and

318
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,010
worrying me about this is that none of

319
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:30,110
the UK artists ever set their base they

320
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:32,090
go right in with the shadows of right on

321
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:34,190
top and kind of blend it even though

322
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:35,810
it's still wet so I want to try to do

323
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:37,910
that today I'm not sure how to nor turn

324
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:39,110
out but clearly they're doing something

325
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,280
right they're putting something in the

326
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:41,660
water over there that's always making

327
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:44,270
the shadow look bomb so you know what

328
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:45,620
we're gonna take risk so unless I throw

329
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:48,080
my brush on the ground like I just did

330
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:49,190
I'm gonna grab my morphe Emma 511 brush

331
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,140
I love this brush that is a really

332
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:53,690
really big fluffy brush and dip into the

333
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:54,800
shade P Louise right here in the palette

334
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:56,900
and I'm going to use this yellow shade

335
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,760
as a transition shade and the outer

336
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:00,050
portion of the crease this I said look

337
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,040
it's gonna be pretty complicated so I

338
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:02,300
don't really want to explain what I'm

339
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,100
doing so I'm gonna go back to answering

340
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:06,140
your guys's questions during the process

341
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:08,480
and sister Bobbie asked have you ever

342
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:10,970
unfollowed one of your fan accounts and

343
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,790
why and the answer to that is actually

344
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:15,350
yes I have one very specific incident in

345
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:17,630
mind and this was a very very hard

346
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:20,060
choice for me to make but I did have a

347
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:22,460
obvious reason for doing so and that

348
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:24,050
being that this person was being very

349
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:26,450
very mean to a lot of my other fan

350
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:27,950
accounts and we actually had an incident

351
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:29,720
in the sister and a few days ago

352
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:32,090
regarding a very similar thing actually

353
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,520
but after all the crap that I've been

354
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:36,350
hit with from BS of stand Twitter and

355
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:38,630
people online just hating me for no

356
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:40,670
reason and just being so nasty the

357
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:44,090
absolute last thing that I want you

358
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:45,440
sisters to be is mean to anybody even if

359
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:46,670
somebody's being the worst person in the

360
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,480
world are being rude to you they're

361
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:49,880
being mean though

362
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:52,070
to somebody else please I asked you guys

363
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:54,080
don't address it don't say anything just

364
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:56,000
be the bigger person and either be nice

365
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,500
about it or just don't say anything at

366
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,790
all if anything you guys know I'm

367
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,110
definitely a firm believer and allowing

368
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:02,120
people to grow and change from their

369
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:03,650
mistakes and although the love from you

370
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,430
guys is always a really really intense

371
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:06,080
and amazing

372
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,520
they hate from the haters is also very

373
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,530
very intense and you guys know that for

374
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:11,690
sure so if the haters coming into the

375
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:12,890
sisterhood already having a bad feeling

376
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:14,570
about us and feeling that we may be

377
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:16,610
really really dramatic or really really

378
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:18,020
scandalous or all have god-like kind of

379
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:20,270
mindset then we all think the same way

380
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:22,250
prove them wrong let's just all be is so

381
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:24,740
amazing and so nice to one another that

382
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:26,180
all the haters come in or like oh oops

383
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,950
these people are actually a really

384
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,970
really dope and James is awesome and all

385
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:30,830
his fans are really really awesome as

386
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:32,450
well so like I was saying I haven't

387
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:34,460
followed a fan account before I'm not

388
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:36,260
happy about it I it paid me a lot to do

389
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,730
so but at the end of the day this person

390
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:39,110
was being very very nasty to a lot of my

391
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:41,320
other friends who I also love and care

392
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:44,270
deeply about and that is never okay so

393
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:45,410
be nice share the love no matter what

394
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:47,270
even if somebody's not sharing the love

395
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:49,760
back because I guarantee it'll come back

396
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:52,700
around to both you and the positively

397
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,260
and them in the negative life Karma's a

398
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,850
[ __ ] sister Zoe asked if you could

399
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:57,050
bring one thing from your house in New

400
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:59,720
York and bring it to your apartment in

401
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:02,300
LA what would it be and why literally

402
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:05,030
the answer this is so easy my dog Benny

403
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:07,160
oh my god I miss him so much

404
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:08,420
it is literally insane and for some

405
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,360
reason too I think there has been a very

406
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:12,800
very strange influx of dogs in my

407
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,470
apartment building recently it's really

408
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,770
just making me so sad and miss him so

409
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,540
much

410
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:18,890
and you guys know like I've been trying

411
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,810
to buy a house really badly and it's not

412
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:22,130
exactly working out but the first thing

413
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:23,480
that I do when I get a house before I

414
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:25,700
even like my furniture is literally

415
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,710
getting a dog I cannot wait to adopt one

416
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:30,080
oh my god I am so beyond excited I need

417
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:31,880
a dog right now in my life I really want

418
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,500
to get like a husky pitbull mix like

419
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:35,540
that just sounds the best and the entire

420
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:37,160
world it's been on my agenda trust me

421
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:38,750
sisters tannaz if you had a launch your

422
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,400
own makeup line what would be the first

423
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,720
product that you would come out with oh

424
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,850
that is totally so easy

425
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:46,100
definitely a 100% in eyeshadow palette

426
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:47,630
you guys know eyeshadow is by far my

427
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,310
favorite part of my makeup routine and

428
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:50,810
so I really feel like I can be super

429
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,670
super creative and always switch things

430
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:55,800
up and always push the boundaries I just

431
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:57,779
live for a good colorful moment

432
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,940
I definitely have if you are really

433
00:12:57,779 --> 00:13:01,350
really or really bomb ideas for palates

434
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:03,180
they've never been done before either so

435
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:05,430
you guys will have to stay tuned and see

436
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:07,290
what happens I'm gonna take this

437
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:08,190
metallic light blue shade if I'm a 35 B

438
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:09,660
you guys know this is my all-time

439
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:11,790
favorite palette from morphe with all

440
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:13,320
the Rainbows she's use go James for 10%

441
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:15,480
off this palette and all other amazing

442
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:19,350
morphe goodies and I'm gonna try to pop

443
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:21,360
this on the lid maybe and this might

444
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:23,010
give us the similar look I'm scared

445
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,529
sister Katie asks what is your current

446
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:26,730
favorite clothing brand oh that's

447
00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:28,470
actually a really really good question

448
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:30,269
and if you had asked me this literally

449
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:32,130
like six months ago my answer would have

450
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:33,779
been literally like per for 21 and top

451
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:36,600
man which is the most boring generic

452
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:38,310
white boy answers ever but my answers

453
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,269
have now drastically changed and I'm

454
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:40,890
actually really happy about it because

455
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:41,850
you guys know I definitely said I'm

456
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:43,560
getting this year that I want to take

457
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:45,180
fashion a way more seriously and really

458
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,040
get into it and just be really proud of

459
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:48,690
the outfits that I wear because a lot of

460
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,190
times my face is looking a real beat but

461
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:52,170
I'd wear the same hoodie and every

462
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:53,220
single picture ever which I'm sure it

463
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:55,440
got really really boring for you guys

464
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,610
were really really fast so right now I'm

465
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,079
really loving a lot of the different

466
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:59,730
trends that are going on involving like

467
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,620
modern street wear

468
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:03,660
that's like my all-time favorite style

469
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:05,760
of fashion I just feel like it's so it's

470
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,870
so so cute for me too I really love that

471
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,610
style because it's really fun to

472
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:11,250
experiment with it and it's like a very

473
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:13,410
very kind of more masculine street wear

474
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:16,260
type of outfit and then just a B ass

475
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:17,910
face right on top I said F gender

476
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:19,350
stereotypes it's very very heterogeneous

477
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:20,940
and it's just really really cool to like

478
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:22,950
play on that and I just have really

479
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:24,750
really been loving it so recently I

480
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:26,310
really been loving the brand jeah the

481
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:28,350
label they are I think in Australia

482
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:29,399
Brent and their products are so done

483
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,930
with actually wearing a shirt for them

484
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:33,720
right now this is like a really really

485
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:35,339
cute jacket I love Laura's boutique use

486
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,660
coach a store 10% off that is actually

487
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:37,890
my best friend's brand but they do have

488
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,600
a lot of really really cute stuff that

489
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:40,470
I've been wearing a lot recently there's

490
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,140
another brand that I've been wearing a

491
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:45,270
lot recently called Medi cow they are a

492
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:47,610
German brand and I actually just found

493
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:49,890
out that there's literally one girl who

494
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:51,270
runs the entire thing and the clothes

495
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,769
are so cute she means everything from

496
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:54,029
scratch if you guys want to go check it

497
00:14:52,769 --> 00:14:55,140
out I will leave her stuff down below

498
00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:56,699
she is so talented

499
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:58,019
actually maybe don't check her out

500
00:14:56,699 --> 00:14:59,699
because then she won't have time to make

501
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:01,050
all my clothes but she was really good

502
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:02,040
she definitely deserves the support I've

503
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:03,149
also been working with a lot of

504
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,050
different designers out here and I like

505
00:15:03,149 --> 00:15:07,860
to get costume

506
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:09,570
has made such as oh wow Brian horns the

507
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:12,240
guy who made all my Coachella looks and

508
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:13,350
literally slayed them is working on so

509
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,830
many cool things for you right now and I

510
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:18,660
am just so so so excited my bank account

511
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:20,490
is not because getting custom fashion is

512
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,930
ridiculous expensive but I'm definitely

513
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:24,060
a firm believer in paying people for

514
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:26,190
their work especially when it's custom

515
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:27,300
and really cool stuff like that and it's

516
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,620
just been really fun for me I really

517
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,940
like the world of fashion it's something

518
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,860
that I've been very very interested in

519
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:33,750
but I've never been very good at so I'm

520
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:35,880
definitely really excited to be working

521
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:37,079
on it a lot more and just be having

522
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,700
really cool outfits that I'm really

523
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:40,440
confident in and feel really proud of

524
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,910
because honestly not gonna lie it's

525
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,829
something that I struggle with a lot so

526
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:45,600
it's been a fun challenge for me and I'm

527
00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:47,579
definitely looking forward to it a lot

528
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,529
sister Rhea asked does it annoy you

529
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:52,050
there's so many people on YouTube use

530
00:15:49,529 --> 00:15:53,160
sister all the time now the same that I

531
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:54,390
get asked all the time and I don't think

532
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,579
I've ever actually addressed it on

533
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:58,709
camera but no matter what way you really

534
00:15:56,579 --> 00:16:00,510
look at it no I don't mind it at all in

535
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:01,740
fact I actually really really love it

536
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:03,240
obviously it started off as like a

537
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:05,100
personal joke between me and my close

538
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,570
friends but when it came time to pick a

539
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,130
name for my fandom because I literally

540
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:10,200
hate the word fan more than anything in

541
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:11,399
the entire world sisters made sense

542
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,110
because it was already what I call my

543
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:15,000
best friends and I like to think of you

544
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:16,890
guys as a far more than fans and kind of

545
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,380
like a close family that we all have

546
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:21,209
together so it made sense and if people

547
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:22,709
want to call it their fans sisters too

548
00:16:21,209 --> 00:16:24,870
that's super cute it just means we're

549
00:16:22,709 --> 00:16:26,910
all one big happy you to a family I

550
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:28,110
think it's super super fun and then also

551
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,560
if you look at it from the other side as

552
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:30,570
well

553
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,850
it's literally a free promotion which

554
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:35,100
I'm definitely never gonna stray from at

555
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:37,110
this point we've kind of reinvented the

556
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,670
word sisters I'm gonna say it we read

557
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:40,440
about - the word sisters and it's how to

558
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:42,690
become like a meme at this point which I

559
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,740
am so down for now a lot of my being on

560
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:45,690
social media has literally been like

561
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:47,550
turning myself into a meme and then

562
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:48,870
profiting off at the hate so that's

563
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:50,490
definitely I'd like to do and sisters

564
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:52,110
has kind of become one of those memes at

565
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:54,630
this point and now I'm known for being

566
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:56,610
hi sisters and I live for us so

567
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:57,000
everybody should say sisters all they

568
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:58,680
want

569
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,240
I do wanna add a little bit more of a

570
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:02,250
pop just like how Mitchell did on his

571
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,050
vision to look with some sister glitters

572
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:05,250
so I'm gonna mix together a few at

573
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:07,260
different once it's just a white

574
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:09,750
translucent one this one is like a blue

575
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,589
a green reflex steel type of one then

576
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:12,300
I'm gonna add in a few of these little

577
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:13,329
holographic star glitters as well

578
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:20,089
right on top of the land

579
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:22,020
[Music]

580
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:23,880
for a lot of thing I'm gonna use the new

581
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:25,709
bounds I'm a dragon Lee Lash's

582
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,209
these are definitely much bolder and

583
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:29,340
bigger than what I usually would wear

584
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:30,390
for a lily lash Miami but I feel like

585
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,740
these will definitely match the look of

586
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:33,210
really really well today and they

587
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:35,280
survived me of the style that all the UK

588
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:36,660
artists use I have not been more proud

589
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,970
and more excited for an eyeshadow look

590
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,870
in a very very long time so I'm gonna go

591
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:41,040
ahead and do the other one on camera

592
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:42,480
quickly and I'll be right back to finish

593
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:45,270
off the rest of the look and answer a

594
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,250
few more juicy scissor questions whoo

595
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:49,350
all right sisters we are back that took

596
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:50,550
me a hot minute to mirror this I

597
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:53,190
overtook this one but I think we got

598
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:54,660
them pretty close I am literally in love

599
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,860
with this look and I'm so excited to

600
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:58,080
finish it I want to take selfies right

601
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:59,730
now so let's go ahead and move on and

602
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,380
finish up next up is obviously gonna be

603
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:02,880
the glow but before we do that I think I

604
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,950
want to answer one last question from

605
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,720
you guys so let's go ahead and see this

606
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:10,220

607
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,220

were before starting the story to my

611
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:20,850
younger audience out there especially

612
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:22,890

00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:35,700
best to kind of you out certain words

and tell the story in the best way

621
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,150
possible it does however have a very

622
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,860
very important message behind it so

623
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:42,720
choosing your own well I'm telling you

624
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:44,340
right now this may be inappropriate but

625
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,480
you already saw most of the makeup look

626
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,830
if you want to click off because you

627
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,680
don't want to hear this I don't blame

628
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:50,820
you but let's jump into the story if

629
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,380
you've been a longtime subscriber in

630
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:54,330
mind any watch a lot of my videos I've

631
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:55,860
alluded to the fact a few times here and

632
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:59,190
there that I may or may not have been

633
00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:00,750
caught when I was younger doing my

634
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:02,130
business and if you've also been a

635
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,780
longtime subscriber you would know that

636
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:05,550
I've never actually told my coming-out

637
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:06,960
story because I've said that there was

638
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:08,070
legal problems with it I didn't know if

639
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,100
I could really tell them without getting

640
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:14,700
in trouble and what people don't know is

641
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:15,570
that those two stories are actually the

642
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,280
same story

643
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:19,470
when I was younger I think and around

644
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:22,590
sixth grade I was 12 years old at the

645
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:24,760
time I was

646
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:26,910
hormonal I had just gone through puberty

647
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:29,140
and just like every other boy I was

648
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:30,580
going through that stage of life clearly

649
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:32,530
at this point in my own head I had

650
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:34,390
figured out that okay I was not exactly

651
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:38,140
interested in the sisters and was

652
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:39,490
definitely done for the brothers so here

653
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,930
we go you guys know that I've definitely

654
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:43,600
always been very very active on social

655
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:45,910
media and at this time period I was

656
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,260
active on tumblr at the time there was a

657
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:49,510
lot of really really famous bloggers

658
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:51,070
that I loved and looked up to and one

659
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:52,720
website that all these famous bloggers

660
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:55,000
would always go on to meet their fans

661
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,560
was called omegle which is an online

662
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,210
chatroom

663
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:00,070
I remember gonna make literally all the

664
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:01,420
time and sitting there for hours

665
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:02,470
clicking through different strangers

666
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,910
trying to find at different famous

667
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:05,230
bloggers that I really really loved and

668
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:06,700
wanted to meet and just wanted to talk

669
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:08,080
to you for a few short seconds and

670
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,660
ironically enough I don't think I ever

671
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,280
once met anybody who I was looking for

672
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:13,450
because there was always a thousands of

673
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:15,760
thousands and thousands people online

674
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:18,400
but when they're scrolling through

675
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:21,520
strangers video cameras on an anonymous

676
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,950
live video cam website I'm sure you can

677
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:28,150
imagine what I started to come across as

678
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:29,860
a hormonal twelve-year-old thinking

679
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:31,090
about this is making me want to die I

680
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:32,800
quickly realized that although a lot of

681
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:34,540
people on tumblr we're using the site to

682
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:36,670
meet their fans and meet new friends

683
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:38,740
that a lot of people were using omegle

684
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:41,140
for different purposes and through

685
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:44,710
realizing this I also started using home

686
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:47,650
Agel for different purposes if you get

687
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:48,070
what I'm putting on the table here oh my

688
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:49,960
god

689
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:51,670
so me and sister-in are three years

690
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,200
apart and the way the school system was

691
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:55,060
divided is we had elementary school

692
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,320
middle school and high school so during

693
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:58,270
middle school when I was in sixth grade

694
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,890
and this is all going on he was still in

695
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:02,170
elementary school meeting every single

696
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:04,330
day I would have an extra guarantee one

697
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:05,800
hour from when I got off the bus at home

698
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,970
to when he would get off the bus at home

699
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,710
since he was coming from a different

700
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:09,970
school once I kind of figured out the

701
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:12,070
schedule and how to really finesse the

702
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:13,870
whole situation the visits to omegle

703
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:16,240
became more and more frequent until they

704
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:18,010
were literally a daily occurrence which

705
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,930
thinking about it now is literally so

706
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:21,610
repulsive but at the time I'm not even

707
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:23,740
gonna lie I was definitely like addicted

708
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:25,750
to it it was a fun challenge for me

709
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:27,610
which is so like psychotic to think

710
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:29,020
about but I was 12 I was very very

711
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:30,220
hormonal I was going through puberty and

712
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,510
that's why I'm telling this story now

713
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:33,220
because obviously it's a very very

714
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:35,170
serious and scary thing that I don't

715
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:37,210
want any of you guys to go through so

716
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:38,770
snob also as well very very important

717
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:41,200
thing to know I was a minor at the time

718
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:44,620
I was obviously at 12 years old but I

719
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:46,030
never once ever ever ever ever ever got

720
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:47,770
naked on camera and to this day I have

721
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:50,230
still never sent a Dickey D Piketty

722
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:51,610
that's for personal reasons but every

723
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:54,040
single time it would always be a guy who

724
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:55,120
was above age doing his business and

725
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:57,400
then when he would ask me to take my

726
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,810
clothes I thought oh he's be like oh my

727
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,520
camera's broken I don't know what's

728
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:01,660
going on I won't turn on what the heck

729
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:04,420
this is so where this has never happened

730
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:05,530
before so I could avoid obviously taking

731
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:07,120
my clothes off which I did not want to

732
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:09,160
do and do not want to blind anybody with

733
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,140
and also of course breaking the law so

734
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:12,640
although this is a horrible idea I did

735
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:15,520
not break any laws which is great

736
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,620
obviously but once again still please do

737
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,850
not do this literally ever anyways like

738
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:20,350
I was saying this became a very very

739
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:22,180
routine I was doing this all the time

740
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:26,890
and I was getting very very good at it

741
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:28,660
until one night that will go down in

742
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:31,000
history forever setting the scene it was

743
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:32,590
probably about 9:10 p.m. on a school

744
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,850
night one night Ian was already asleep

745
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:35,230
because he was much younger than I was

746
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:36,850
and my mom was already asleep as well

747
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:38,260
because she always was a bad very very

748
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:40,390
early for some reason so the only people

749
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:42,190
wake in the house for myself and my dad

750
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:43,510
and my dad always would chill in his

751
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:45,160
living room watching football or

752
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:46,840
watching the news super super late at

753
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:50,500
night every single night and his living

754
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:52,930
room was right below my bedroom in our

755
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:54,280
house I remember very very vividly I was

756
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:56,950
writing an essay for a history class

757
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:59,410
that I absolutely hate it and in the

758
00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:01,330
middle of it I took a break to do my

759
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:03,160
business so I went on to omegle calm

760
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:05,560
started searching through people

761
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:07,570
eventually found someone and there we go

762
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:10,270
things got started and all of a sudden

763
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:13,210
in the middle of my business

764
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:15,970
tickling the pickle my door slams open

765
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:18,070
and there's my father in the doorway

766
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:19,780
looking at very concerned and there is

767
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:21,910
me standing right in front of my

768
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:23,200
computer which is in the same line of

769
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:26,170
view as my door

770
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:28,270
butt-naked with the screen lit up right

771
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:29,410
in front of me and all he said was you

772
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:30,490
need to turn that off and go to bed

773
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:33,310
right now

774
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:35,920
so I said got it sir good night love you

775
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:39,280
the most and I read my little naked butt

776
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:41,500
into my bed and shut my eyes and cry

777
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,850
myself to sleep the next morning I woke

778
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,779
up one downstairs for breakfast took a

779
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:45,429
shower and

780
00:23:43,779 --> 00:23:46,899
nothing happened nothing was different

781
00:23:45,429 --> 00:23:48,340
my dad did not look at me different my

782
00:23:46,899 --> 00:23:50,559
mom did not know what was going on I

783
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:52,359
said yeah and I was so confused and also

784
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,950
obviously like literally having a panic

785
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:55,719
attack the entire day of freaking out

786
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:58,029
wondering what was gonna go on did he

787
00:23:55,719 --> 00:23:59,739
see anything clearly he saw something of

788
00:23:58,029 --> 00:24:02,080
mine but did he see anything on the

789
00:23:59,739 --> 00:24:04,899
computer screen so I was freaking out

790
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:07,149
all day long said nothing go to school

791
00:24:04,899 --> 00:24:09,549
all day long awesome and periods nothing

792
00:24:07,149 --> 00:24:10,599
no texts nada obviously I know that

793
00:24:09,549 --> 00:24:11,499
something is going to go down and

794
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:12,789
they're going to say something but I

795
00:24:11,499 --> 00:24:15,249
didn't know when I didn't know what they

796
00:24:12,789 --> 00:24:16,989
were going to do and I I just didn't

797
00:24:15,249 --> 00:24:18,279
know another time I was so freaked out

798
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:19,929
and I was so nervous than when I got

799
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:21,609
home from school that day I didn't even

800
00:24:19,929 --> 00:24:23,049
go upstairs I literally Santos's that I

801
00:24:21,609 --> 00:24:23,379
think I was like drawing a picture or

802
00:24:23,049 --> 00:24:24,789
something

803
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:26,289
you guys don't used to draw all the time

804
00:24:24,789 --> 00:24:27,279
was all my favorite hobbies that was one

805
00:24:26,289 --> 00:24:28,929
of the only things that I could do

806
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:30,700
before I really had makeup to kind of

807
00:24:28,929 --> 00:24:33,339
escape and to just really focus on my

808
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:34,599
creativity and love the outside world go

809
00:24:33,339 --> 00:24:36,519
away because at that moment I just

810
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:37,659
wanted to disappear into a hole and

811
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:40,659
never come out

812
00:24:37,659 --> 00:24:44,440
well behold when both my parents get

813
00:24:40,659 --> 00:24:46,479
home they say sister James well I was

814
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:47,830
just changed at the time but James we

815
00:24:46,479 --> 00:24:50,529
need to talk please come with us

816
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:52,119
upstairs and instantly as soon as I

817
00:24:50,529 --> 00:24:55,509
walked upstairs to them and said that my

818
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:57,639
bed and started talking I realized oh my

819
00:24:55,509 --> 00:24:59,440
god this entire time I've been so

820
00:24:57,639 --> 00:25:01,719
nervous that I have not touched my

821
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,210
computer since last night when I jumped

822
00:25:01,719 --> 00:25:06,249
from my computer chair 70 feet across my

823
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:09,879
bedroom straight into my bed butt-naked

824
00:25:06,249 --> 00:25:12,039
meaning I did not clear my internet

825
00:25:09,879 --> 00:25:13,570
history so sitting there talking to them

826
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:14,799
the entire time I was already freaking

827
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:17,109
out but now I'm really freaking out

828
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:19,419
because I'm realizing oh my god if my

829
00:25:17,109 --> 00:25:21,429
dad did not see anything now he's really

830
00:25:19,419 --> 00:25:23,139
gonna see something so of course the

831
00:25:21,429 --> 00:25:24,789
first thing that comes out of their

832
00:25:23,139 --> 00:25:26,859
mouth is we would love to check your

833
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:28,659
internet history my heart literally sunk

834
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:30,460
faster than the Titanic and that walk

835
00:25:28,659 --> 00:25:32,200
from my bed over to the computer

836
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:33,489
turning on typing in my password going

837
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:36,519
to Google Chrome opening the internet

838
00:25:33,489 --> 00:25:39,969
history and it being right there right

839
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:41,950
at the top was probably the hardest 10

840
00:25:39,969 --> 00:25:43,929
seconds of my entire life I can

841
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:46,089
literally see the disappointment in my

842
00:25:43,929 --> 00:25:48,609
parents face and they clicked on omegle

843
00:25:46,089 --> 00:25:50,649
and there was the blog website and what

844
00:25:48,609 --> 00:25:52,779
made it even worse that I literally

845
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:54,130
forgot about once again on the front

846
00:25:52,779 --> 00:25:55,210
pages you can put an intro

847
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:57,250
of the different topics that you'd want

848
00:25:55,210 --> 00:26:00,250
to talk about so for example soccer

849
00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:02,380
football webkinz Club Penguin at the

850
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:03,940
time or the names of 12 and 13 year old

851
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:06,789
bloggers that I was trying to find but

852
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:08,380
now instead right there on the front

853
00:26:06,789 --> 00:26:14,350
page was about a ten word list

854
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:17,950
consisting of gay by men boys and woo

855
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:23,049
there was the closet door was flung open

856
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:24,640
and outran me unintentionally I remember

857
00:26:23,049 --> 00:26:25,809
Hensley started balling as any child

858
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,309
would because I was obviously

859
00:26:25,809 --> 00:26:29,200
embarrassed that they caught me doing

860
00:26:27,309 --> 00:26:30,970
this but also now because I was out of

861
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,580
the closet and in this current moment I

862
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:35,770
was not exactly ready to fly myself out

863
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:37,270
like that but thinking about it now I'm

864
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:39,039
actually kind of thankful that this did

865
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:41,080
happen as crazy as that sounds because

866
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:42,370
the conversation after is probably one

867
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:44,470
of the coolest conversation I've ever

868
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:45,669
had at my parents in my entire life I

869
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:46,929
love them the most we've always been

870
00:26:45,669 --> 00:26:48,460
very very close with this conversation

871
00:26:46,929 --> 00:26:49,720
meant a lot to me because instead of

872
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:51,220
freaking out about me being gay and my

873
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,210
dad is very very Catholic as well so

874
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:54,159
that was something that I was super

875
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:56,470
super scared about the conversation was

876
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:58,150
very obviously more tailored towards

877
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:59,260
please don't do this this is so

878
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:00,850
dangerous there were predators out there

879
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:02,380
like you are putting yourself at such a

880
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:04,510
major risk and we don't want to see you

881
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:06,940
either get in trouble or get hurt and

882
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:09,250
I'm so thankful for that because from

883
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:10,929
that day on I never once did it again

884
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:12,280
and I've always been so careful about

885
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:14,320
that I've always been a very very huge

886
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:16,390
advocate for myself and my friends about

887
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:19,929
online pornography and chat rooms like

888
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:21,159
that but whoo that moment of my life is

889
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:23,200
probably one of these scariest things

890
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:25,690
that I've ever had a deal with it was so

891
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,940
horrifying it was embarrassing it was

892
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:30,490
sad it was just a lot of emotions going

893
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:32,080
on at one time and I'm so thankful to my

894
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:35,200
parents hilda and the way that they did

895
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:36,789
but yeah that's how I got caught doing

896
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,559
my business on a chatroom with the

897
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:40,900
camera off thank God and that is also

898
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:42,490
how I came out of the closet to my

899
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,809
parents I literally cannot believe I

900
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:45,400
just said this all in a video I had

901
00:27:43,809 --> 00:27:47,679
never told this story publicly ever once

902
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,700
in my entire life but I think that this

903
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,320
does have a very important message

904
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:52,570
behind it obviously it was very very

905
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,980
embarrassing at the time and thank God

906
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:56,350
we my family can laugh about it now

907
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:56,799
several several years later dad I love

908
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:58,690

911
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:04,120
important message behind of Internet

00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:05,409

a picture even though their phone so

925
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:26,170

00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:30,640
years later as blackmail and it's just

00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:42,120
mistakes it's dangerous and it's very

935
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:45,790
very embarrassing if you get caught so

936
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:47,020

937
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:49,420

938
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:51,010
and last but finally not least after

939
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:52,570
filming this for four hours and it's

940
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:54,190
been a long time since I've been this

941
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:56,050
obsessed with the makeup look on my face

942
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:57,370
so I definitely need to set it and lock

943
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:59,020
it in place for the rest of the night so

944
00:28:57,370 --> 00:29:00,730
I'm gonna grab the screen to Navy eye

945
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:03,910
makeup finishing spray and get wake up a

946
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:06,550

locked in and ready just go you guys all

949
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,420
right and you can use code James for

950
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:12,910
money off your purchase I think it's

951
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:14,350
like 25% which is pretty low so go check

952
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:16,270
it out I'll raise this is that is

953
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:17,980
definitely enough questions for today

954
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:20,950

955
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:22,840
well oh my god I absolutely love how

blue and the kind of burnt orange ready

959
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:29,500
