6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,759
as brother and sister that's your

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,920
brother

8
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,920
okay whatever

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,920
for today's episode we thought it would

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,640
be really good

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,240
and fun so in case you have not been on

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,400
youtube for the past

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,480
year you may have missed probably the

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,960
biggest trend

15
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,520
of all time first of all you're doing it

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,640
wrong

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,680
when you talk you have to go like that

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:46,000
that happens later no

19
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:48,960
it goes on for today's episode

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,680
we're gonna be doing asmr if you can

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,600
already tell

22
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,120
because we're whispering so it's

23
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,800
probably obvious

24
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,360
ninety percent of the heat comments i

25
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,079
get on my videos on a daily basis

26
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,320
are that people hate my voice and to

27
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:06,159
those comments i say

28
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:08,320
i agree so this should be really fun

29
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,600
um and hopefully you really like my

30
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,880
voice if i'm not

31
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,000
really talking so that's good that's

32
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,840
kind of all the way around

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,280
shhh it's kind of the other way around

34
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,560
for me what do you mean

35
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,560
like people like my voice like oh my god

36
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,479
your voice is so deep it's not true

37
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,960
right sorry guys you're not gonna be

38
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,960
hearing much

39
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,799
so i've really only watched a few asmr

40
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,840
videos and i'm going to be honest going

41
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,240
into this

42
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,600
i have not really gotten the tingles

43
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,960
from them

44
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,040
i know that they do actually help a lot

45
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,439
of people with anxiety and with stress

46
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,560
for me they help me in a different way

47
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,960
which is

48
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,399
laughing at comedy yes for today's video

49
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,640
we thought it'd be really fun

50
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,560
to go into this with an open mind and

51
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,079
really try to

52
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,079
make it tingle for a real one

53
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,520
we are going to just be talking and

54
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,520
interacting

55
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,960
and we're a sister starting so probably

56
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:09,119
gonna order some food

57
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,119
and do a mukbang together wait wait

58
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,200
so hopefully we catch a good and you

59
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,640
just

60
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,640

61
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:31,840

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,160
response i don't know what two of those

65
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,160
words mean

66
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,440
it's an experience characterized like a

67
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,480
static

68
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:49,120
like or tingling sensation on the skin

69
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,280
that typically begins on the scalp and

70
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,959
posed at the back of the neck and upper

watching asmr videos because

122
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,759
while i'm filming this i feel like i

123
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,879
feel very creepy

124
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:01,360
and weird i'm uncomfortable and yeah but

125
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,960
it's kind of fun and fresh it kind of is

126
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,560
i'm gonna take a bite of this crunchy

127
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,479
chicken slab of

128
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,759
meat it's kind of not that crunchy

129
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:13,840
though because it's kind of this one

130
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:13,840
this one's crunchy

133
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:27,840
recorded in my life
