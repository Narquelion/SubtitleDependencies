with this look I love this and

41
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:33,299
ironically enough as well we honestly

42
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,460
shot the packaging photos for the

43
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:37,979
palette over six months ago now and

44
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,869
somehow this look happened to become a

45
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:41,790
trend in the big community a few months

46
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:43,590
ago which I thought was so so so funny

47
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:44,700
so major sound us to all the artists out

48
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,220

promo before my product was even out Co

50
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,640
but in reality great minds do think

51
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:51,840

52
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,369

campaign look today so that further ado

56
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:02,610
let's jump into this first ever tutorial

57
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:04,500
using my palette my brushes my

58
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:06,440
collection with morphe and let's unleash

59
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,560
our inner artists

60
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,560
[Music]

61
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:13,099
so my face is already completely on

62
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,480
because we just thought the music slips

63
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:19,099
for the commercial this morning about

64
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,989
I'm just going to uh oh ouch pop off my

65
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:22,849
lashes and add my look on top of this

66
00:02:20,989 --> 00:02:24,650
I'm first gonna go up in 4 3 3 brush and

67
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:27,620
dip into the shade escape and I'm going

68
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:30,410
to pop this right on the outer corner

69
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:34,310
and start Tilly and like imagine it's

70
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:35,629
gonna be like a Hello the outer V I

71
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:37,730
normally don't apply shadows like this

72
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:39,080
either but my goal for creating this

73
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:40,970
palette was to create really really

74
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,200
pigmented and fully matte eyeshadows

75
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,819
because it's saying that I've wanted in

76
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,410
my kit as an artist literally since

77
00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:46,459
starting in the makeup game and of

78
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:48,140
course it's been a lot of really really

79
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:49,640
bomb talent but one of the problems with

80
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:51,260
propellants I feel like is that they all

81
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,420
look so beautiful inside the actual

82
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:55,010
palette but a lot of the shadows don't

83
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,420
actually apply that pigmented onto the

84
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:57,890
skin but I really wanted to create a

85
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,420
really pigmented really bomb and really

86
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:01,160
really bright rainbow colors and through

87
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:02,269
doing that some of the matte shades are

88
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,310
either matte or some of them are

89
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:05,299
actually pressed pigments which means

90
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,379
you just have to work with them in a

91
00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:08,540
little bit of a different way and that

92
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:10,099
means packing on that shadow first next

93
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,750
thing we have another M 4-3-3 brush and

94
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:13,790
dip into the shade single which is that

95
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:16,069
lighter purple shade and I'm gonna use

96
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:17,959
this too lightly diffuse out the edges

97
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:19,609
I'm just gonna tuck that right into the

98
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:20,900
crease as well moving on we're gonna

99
00:03:19,609 --> 00:03:22,010
come back to that in a little bath now

100
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,510
that the Purple's all place on the outer

101
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,889
corner and it's all set in place I'm

102
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:27,200
just going to grab an Emma four-for-one

103
00:03:24,889 --> 00:03:29,540
brush and dip into B which is the bright

104
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,730
yellow shade this is by far the best

105
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:41,299
bright yellow shadow I have ever tried

106
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:43,220
look at this ready hello oh my god like

107
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:44,510
literally you're kidding me

108
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:46,430
and I was gonna pop this right on my

109
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:47,599
inner corner kind of letting into the

110
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:49,340
nose contour as well I just pull

111
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,410
something right into that crease region

112
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:53,030
next I'm going to grab another and 4-3-3

113
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:54,919
brush this is why I love this brush

114
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:56,209
that's so so so much because they're

115
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:57,919
multiples of many of the different eye

116
00:03:56,209 --> 00:03:58,970
brushes which make it so perfect for

117
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:00,230
doing rainbow looks like this you don't

118
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,549
have to wash your brushes in the middle

119
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:03,380
of them and you also don't have to buy a

120
00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:05,299
million-two them from the website you

121
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:07,340
get them all at once in the brush kit so

122
00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:09,169
good it's so fresh so helpful I went to

123
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,639
this shade right into the bright red

124
00:04:09,169 --> 00:04:12,440
which is called you're kidding

125
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:14,590
why is it called that you're gonna find

126
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:17,120
out when I put this on you're kidding

127
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:19,820
look at the pigmentation oh my god that

128
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,049
is like a true true true rad rad as all

129
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,160
of the shades that I was most excited

130
00:04:21,049 --> 00:04:23,810
about but also most nervous about

131
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,389
because firm leading a bright red shadow

132
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:27,169
is really really hard and I also feel

133
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:29,090
like it's something that is always

134
00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:30,560
missing from every single palette I feel

135
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:32,990
like every read either reads a burnt

136
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:36,199
orange or magenta and I was like now I

137
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:39,710
want red like is it that hard and it was

138
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:41,690
apparently I was wrong but we did it and

139
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:43,370
it looks bomb know that same exact brush

140
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:45,380
I'm gonna dip into the shade of five on

141
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,830
eight which is the bright light orange

142
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,080
color

143
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:51,259
I'm obsessed with this orange it is so

144
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,750
neon so cool and I'm going to just blend

145
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:55,880
the yellow and red shades together so

146
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:59,449
now I'm going to take my favorite brush

147
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:02,870
of this entire collection this ladies

148
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:05,210
and gentlemen is the M 4 5 6 so you're

149
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:08,060
probably thinking that's just another

150
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:10,250
fuzzy batch no it's not you guys know

151
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:13,310
the Emperor 33 is my ride-or-die okay I

152
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:14,900
literally have 36 of these in my makeup

153
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:16,310
collection and they all are covered and

154
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,990
dirty and a million different eye shadow

155
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:19,789
colors I love this brush I could

156
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:23,270
literally do an entire shadow look with

157
00:05:19,789 --> 00:05:24,560
this brush but now we have the M 4 5 6

158
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:26,389
which is literally a brush that I have

159
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,729
wanted to create since I started working

160
00:05:26,389 --> 00:05:31,460
with morphe so many years ago it is

161
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:33,770
literally the m-43 threes babies sister

162
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:35,630
it is the same exact brush just half the

163
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:36,860
size now this brush is going to be so

164
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:38,419
perfect for those of you out there who

165
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:40,280
have a smaller eyes and still want to

166
00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:41,960
create that beautiful blended look or if

167
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,550
you people like me who have big eyes but

168
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,560
like to do kind of detailed rainbow

169
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:46,490
intricate blending looks this brush is

170
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,690
perfect because it still blows

171
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:49,639
everything out but you can really get

172
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:50,780
right in those crease regions to just

173
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:53,509
blend in to fuse that color without

174
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:55,250
getting it everywhere so I'm gonna dip

175
00:05:53,509 --> 00:05:57,530
this brush into the shade skip which is

176
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:59,539
the bright neon pink and I'm gonna use

177
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:01,789
this to connect the red and diffuse out

178
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:03,139
the edge of the purple if you ever need

179
00:06:01,789 --> 00:06:05,090
to fix any blending describe your atom

180
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:09,280
at 4 or 5 6 the perfect tiny blending

181
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:11,660
brush and just go right back in there

182
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,860
NextEra grab by other at four five six

183
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:15,230
that comes into the collection and dip

184
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:16,850
into the shade escape this is the darker

185
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:18,440
purple shade I'm gonna pop this right in

186
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:19,760
the outer V to start creating some

187
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,900
dimension I'm just gonna put a little

188
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,820
bit more of that single shade into the

189
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:24,680
crease for some more dimension to for my

190
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:26,840
auto color I'm gonna grab my IVA 506

191
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,669
brush from the brush tat I love this

192
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:31,130
tiny brush for blending out the outer V

193
00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:33,050
and dip into a little bit of the shade

194
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:34,520
of spooky deep blonde shade in the

195
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:36,440
palette I'm gonna be very very careful

196
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,550
cuz I don't want to add too much just

197
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,530
kind of patting that on there and

198
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:40,940
lightly blending it out and then going

199
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:42,680
back into the M four five six

200
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,850
and there's escape so this is looking

201
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,280
messy right now we're obviously going to

202
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:47,570
clean it up do not worry so now we're at

203
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,010
the stage where I want to cut the crease

204
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:51,139
and lay down the rest of the shadows so

205
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:52,400
I'm going to grab an damnit two to four

206
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:55,040
brush this is my favorite concealer and

207
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,330
just a thick white concealer and I'm

208
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,639
just gonna go right in on the inner

209
00:06:56,330 --> 00:07:01,370
corner cutting my crease a little bit

210
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,260
bigger than normal and then governing to

211
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:05,060
n43 one this is the little pencil brush

212
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:06,770
from the kit I'm gonna grab a tiny bit

213
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,660
more of that concealer on the paint

214
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:10,430
brush I just got a little bit off and

215
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:12,590
I'm gonna go in and actually diffuse out

216
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:16,039
those edges because I don't want this to

217
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:18,530
be a crease I want it to be like a paper

218
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:20,090
cut crease now we're gonna have a one 6x

219
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:22,520
brush and dip into the white shade in

220
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:24,380
the palette which is a flashback based

221
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,870
on the most iconic internet meme of all

222
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:28,280
time I really wanted to make a super

223
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:30,169
pigmented white eye shadow because I

224
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:32,720
feel like these are really really really

225
00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:34,130
hard to find and I also decided to place

226
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,440
it in the middle row as well because a

227
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:39,050
lot of you guys love using white when it

228
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,970
comes to either track or theater or just

229
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:43,370
avant-garde looks in general I will say

230
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:46,010
confidently non bias as well this is by

231
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:48,229
far the best most pigmented white

232
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:50,360
eyeshadow I have ever tried or seen I

233
00:07:48,229 --> 00:07:52,190
swear to God you could either put it on

234
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:54,169
once purchased a light little wash of

235
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:56,180
white or the shadow does layer up and

236
00:07:54,169 --> 00:08:02,570
you can literally make it like bright

237
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:03,770
white that's what I wait so good once

238
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:05,150
that why I said it I'm just gonna take

239
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:07,130
my original fluffy brushes and just go

240
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:08,690
lightly over those edges to even diffuse

241
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,889
it a little bit more now to fix this

242
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:11,750
whole moment in here because this is

243
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:12,569
obviously not the tea I'm gonna add some

244
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,610
blue

245
00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:16,860

246
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:18,719

together and then going back in and

259
00:08:37,709 --> 00:08:40,409

add some more dimension to the lid I'm

264
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:49,500
gonna use the peaches and cream at

265
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,300

274
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:05,940
glitter reflex but I don't want my

275
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:07,019
eyelid to literally feel crusty because

276
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:09,660
that's the worst feeling in the entire

277
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:11,389
world and then just finally some super

278
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:13,980

00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:03,440
instead of white to paint my face right

365
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,480
I'm going to use the Kryolan aqua color

366
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,190
what is this pan thing I'm gonna give it

367
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,290
a good spread so using the morphe prep

368
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:12,150
and set this is water activated but fun

369
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:14,110
fact this does actually work too so it

370
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:18,960
used hojae's for 10% off

371
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:18,960
[Music]

372
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:24,700
that looks beautiful

373
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:26,770
no one does an everyday makeup look I

374
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:31,720
think so is it the grocery store maybe

375
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:33,160
mm-hmm I always love a putting makeup on

376
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,990
my ears too I feel like every time I do

377
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,100
like more creative looks like this I

378
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:37,840
always try to incorporate it and I

379
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,980
always get weird comments be like oh my

380
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,630
god why don't you put on this ear but

381
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,800
like it just pulls the entire piece

382
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:43,600
together like your ears are part of your

383
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:46,450
face and it also low-key tickles and

384
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,430
kind of feels got to him I'm just gonna

385
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:50,770
grab a tiny bit of foundation on the

386
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:51,970
back of my hand and with that savings

387
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,710
like fan brush I'm just gonna go like

388
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:55,390
over just like I did with the white some

389
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:56,620
of those edges just to kind of bring

390
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:59,370
back for the foundation and make it

391
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:01,570
truly look like it is being painted on

392
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:07,170

393
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:10,370
