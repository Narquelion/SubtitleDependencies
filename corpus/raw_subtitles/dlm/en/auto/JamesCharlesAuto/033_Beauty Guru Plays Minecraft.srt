have never seen before and that's

5
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:12,690
because today we are playing a crunch

6
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:14,549
tag game with James obviously if I saw

7
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,590

8
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:18,270
to be a religious Mario Kart Wii Hummer

9
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,550
recently there has done like a kind of

10
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:22,650
resurgent rebirth if you will of

11
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,869
Minecraft in the YouTube community and I

12
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,710
am so here for it literally like it used

13
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:27,390
to be my favorite thing in the entire

14
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:30,000
world I would go home from school every

15
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:31,590
single day and be some kitty girls up in

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,700
the Minecraft Hunger Games and that is

17
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,040
exactly what we're gonna be doing in

18
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,540
today's brand new video there's a

19
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,160
tournament called minecraft Mondays

20
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,230
where basically you compete to the death

21
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,270
a bunch of other youtubers last week I

22
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:44,010
was teamed with the legend PewDiePie and

23
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,020
it was probably some of the most fun

24
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:49,649
three hours of my entire life we didn't

25
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:51,690
exactly when we didn't even get close

26
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:53,969
let's be really kind of lucky sot james

27
00:00:51,690 --> 00:01:10,049
team playing yeah that's happening okay

28
00:00:53,969 --> 00:01:10,770
where are you did you die i'll be

29
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:12,780
revitalised

30
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:16,880
be my eyes on the sky mama huh that's

31
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,880
right you don't call me mama please

32
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:32,759
James which is reading all the comments

33
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:35,159
and the memes and people posting little

34
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,110
clips of our playback was so much fun

35
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:38,610
and watching it has made me really angry

36
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:41,400
because I used to be good at this game

37
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:43,170
but now I saw so for today's video I

38
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,509
thought it'd be kind of fun to introduce

39
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,280
house china games with James to all my

40
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:48,840

41
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,579

00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,950
I go ahead and practice and get ready
