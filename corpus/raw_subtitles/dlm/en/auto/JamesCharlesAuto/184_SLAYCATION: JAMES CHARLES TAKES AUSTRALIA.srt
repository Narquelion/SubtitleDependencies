167
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,860
we kept rewriting over over again

168
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,880
because there's the camera at the top

169
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,590
just like every rise that takes your

170
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,850
photo and by the second time around we

171
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:53,290
figured out where the camera was so we

172
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,910
wanted to create an Instagram meme out

173
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:57,250
of it because y'all know it that's what

174
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:59,590
I'm known for starting a meme anyway

175
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:01,270
guys for clothes none of us are looking

176
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:23,680

177
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:27,210
