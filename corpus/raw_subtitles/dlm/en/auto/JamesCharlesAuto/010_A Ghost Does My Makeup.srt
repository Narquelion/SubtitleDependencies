00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
hi sisters James Charles here and

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,339
welcome back to my youtube channel so

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,560
halloween is coming up literally in a

4
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:09,540
few days now and I am so beyond excited

5
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,179
Halloween by far is my favorite time of

6
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,290
the entire year but I've been working on

7
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,730
a lot of different projects behind the

8
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,220
scenes this past month and I have not

9
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,770
had any time to do a single Halloween

10
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,359
look or tutorial and I am very sad about

11
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,920
it I do have a few things up my sleeve

12
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,680
for the next few days of Halloween time

13
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,560
but for today's video I thought I would

14
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,779
do something truly iconic perfect for

15
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,340
sister spooky season something that I

16
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:33,780
have wanted to do literally since I was

17
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,300
a little kid and for some reason it

18
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:39,780
never got around to doing playing with a

19
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:41,160
Ouija board oh my gosh wow it's almost

20
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,750
like the spirits are ready for me to

21
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,640
play so as you can see I have a brand

22
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,280
new Ouija board right here and I am so

23
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,410
beyond ready to contact the sister

24
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,700
spirits my mind is open I'm gonna set

25
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,199
some candles and really get in the mood

26
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,309
and for today's video you know on this

27
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:55,379
channel we always like to set the bar

28
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:57,629
higher so I figured why not try to have

29
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:58,620
a Ouija board pick my makeup since I've

30
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:00,149
never played at the Wii deeper before

31
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,859
and the last thing that I want to do is

32
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:05,040
anger the sister spirits because that

33
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:06,930
sounds not fun I'm kind of fun not gonna

34
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,909
lie but probably not good for me I

35
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,250
thought I would read the directions so I

36
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:13,979
don't die Ouija board the quest begins

37
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,630
dim the lights oh we're already feeling

38
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:17,009
step 1 this is a makeup tutorial so

39
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,900
hopefully the spirits love some good

40
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:20,490
Beauty lighting as it glides across the

41
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,710
board the Ouija planchette will reveal

42
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,810
headed messages Ouija are you there

43
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:26,369
place two fingers lightly on the

44
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,869
planchette oh god here we go okay I just

45
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:29,549
got my nails done hopefully the spirits

46
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:32,520
like them speak your sÃ©ance to contact

47
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:33,600
the spirits okay let the bravest among

48
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,100
you ask the first question

49
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,780
give Ouija enough time to respond or

50
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,340
ember and spirits can't be rushed

51
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,110
it's so true that makes two of us

52
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,610
concentrate deeply if the planchette

53
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:45,290
doesn't move ask another question and

54
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:47,189
focus always speak slowly and clearly oh

55
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:49,710
it's gonna be a problem

56
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:51,960
always speak slowly and clearly just as

57
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,460
friendly spirits prefer oh my god if I

58
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,990
speak my normal speed am I gonna contact

59
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,180
a demon and don't forget to say goodbye

60
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,680
when you're done my mind is open I think

61
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,840
I know what to do I'm ready to contact

62
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,369
