5
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:10,320

on the planet the ones that gave birth

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,690
to me sister mother Charles and sister

8
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:19,439
father Charles welcome to our channel

9
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:21,449
brother oh my god so my entire family

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,590
because they right now LA and on my

11
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:24,090
channel I do a really awesome series

12
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,980
called Beauty battles where I have two

13
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,449
different people both take one half of

14
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,680
my face with all the same makeup

15
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:31,019
products and they are challenged to see

16
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,360
who is the better ME way and being that

17
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:35,940
these two people came together to give

18
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,010
birth to me I makeup guru I figured what

19
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,899
better way to test out who I really got

20
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,610
the makeup knowledge from my dad or my

21
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:43,469
mom then have them do an episode of

22
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,030
Beauty battles so that is exactly what

23
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:49,010
we're gonna do today how do we feel

24
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:49,010
about this are we excited excited I am

25
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:57,449
excited I'm a little nervous because

26
00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:59,489
although I wear makeup every day your

27
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:01,079
father is a much better artist than I am

28
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:02,670
yeah so I was gonna say that too I think

29
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,500
that the playing field is definitely

30
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,820
actually even in this situation at my

31
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,500
mom wears makeup every day and as the

32
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,790
true sister she watches all my YouTube

33
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,560
videos she's always the first person

34
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,030
text me every single time I upload be

35
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,140
like great for you you can't drink on

36
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:18,270
camera I didn't I definitely think she

37
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:21,119
has that makeup knowledge but my dad is

38
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:23,009
far more creative far more artsy I think

39
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,820
like we said this could be anybody's

40
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:25,259
game at this point

41
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,909
without further ado if you'd like to see

42
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:28,890
my parents a battle to see who was the

43
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:31,500
better anyway and learned about me and

44
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:38,159
my childhood and our crazy family keep

45
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:39,900
on watching okay so for today's video I

46
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,619
picked this look out for you guys to try

47
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:46,079
to recreate today it's really simple

48
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:49,100
sure I'm gonna take the Tarte shape tape

49
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,100
you're doing this first

50
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,730
[Applause]

51
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,320
so tutored Assessors and I asked you

52
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:00,210
guys to send in questions for my parents

53
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,640
answer about me and my childhood and

54
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:04,290
growing up with me and sister Ian so are

55
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,270
you guys ready for a quick little Q &

56
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:09,780
slay sure why are you pushing it you're

57
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:14,220
pushing his face I'm just holding my

58
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:16,410
thing gently and you're like I'm trying

59
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,640
to would you keep moving it around the

60
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,650
first question is from Jenna and she

61
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,300
said huh see you guys

62
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:23,940
how did y'all react when James wanted to

63
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:26,850
start doing makeup I just was confused

64
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:31,500
at first because I've never seen boys

65
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:35,160
wear makeup so whatever my first thought

66
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:37,680
was that perhaps he was transgender

67
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:40,680
which would have been totally fine but

68
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,920
that was a whole new unfamiliar area for

69
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:46,590
me and I was nervous for him and I was

70
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,600
nervous for myself because I knew things

71
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:50,790
would change but once we realized that

72
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,590
James was comfortable with himself we

73
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:54,570
were comfortable with him and we were

74
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:57,240
very supportive and still are with what

75
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:59,220
he's doing yeah for sure it was nothing

76
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,989
like a rough patch in our family and

77
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,580
everybody was kind of confused but I

78
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:04,200
kind of like try to explain to them as

79
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,610
best as I possibly could that I was

80
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,930
comfortable my gender identity I just

81
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:09,570
wanted to do this to kind of express

82
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:11,070
myself and of course like once I started

83
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:12,330
like gaining followers and getting

84
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:14,040
paychecks and stuff it became more of a

85
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:15,930
reality that like I wanted to do I was

86
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,090
like something serious other than just a

87
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:19,650
little hobby after school going back

88
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:21,950
even further though we asked what was

89
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:26,640
your guys's reaction to James being gay

90
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:29,570
you're gay I don't know do you have the

91
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:35,549
better side or do I I'm not sure I got

92
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:36,930
no better Oh Nicole asks how was the

93
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,340
family decision of James not going to

94
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,930
college and if he did go what would you

95
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,360
have liked him to study architecture

96
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:44,549
interior design fashion design I think

97
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,920
that would have been his forte actually

98
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:50,970
the whole College thing happened rather

99
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:56,790
quickly in my mind he was

100
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:59,100
I believe yes that he would have studied

101
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:01,440
something in the creative arts field and

102
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:03,200
I was still determined that he was gonna

103
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:06,060
go to college up until the very last

104
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,400
second okay so I actually have a

105
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,570
follow-up question for you two I was in

106
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,460
high school working really hard in doing

107
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:13,440
well on my grades but kind of last

108
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,970
second I kind of hit you guys with hey

109
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,530
I'm graduating early and moving to

110
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:18,750
California not going to college do you

111
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:19,920
have any advice as parents to any other

112
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,200
parents out there who may be watching

113
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,220
with their kids about college and for

114
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,570
those kids who might not feel like

115
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,900
college is the right path for them

116
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:32,220
obviously each individual each

117
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:36,510
circumstances obviously each person each

118
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:38,130
individual we're gonna be here okay I'm

119
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:41,210
glad I promise go ahead

120
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:50,250
so obviously each individual is unique

121
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:52,640
each situation is unique we you answer a

122
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,640
smartypants

123
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:01,970
if your son or daughter's got good

124
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,200
grades and they've been working hard and

125
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:04,220
if they want to go to school let him go

126
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,100
to school if they don't want to go to

127
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:09,320
school you're in the dream for about 80

128
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:11,840
grand a year so what kind of from that

129
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,460
standard life on a budget by budgetary

130
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,860
I'm asked what's the most embarrassing

131
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:18,500
thing sister James said as a child

132
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:21,580
t-ball sitting at the second base line

133
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:23,390
braiding the second baseman's hair

134
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:25,220
that's embarrassing

135
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:26,810
she looks great Gabriella looked amazing

136
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:29,120
she did look great but we ran a t-ball

137
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:31,130
game priorities I didn't think the

138
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,780
baseball field or the infield was

139
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:34,640
exactly the place to be braiding

140
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:36,200
Gabriella's hair that's what did it for

141
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,910
me that's what I knew something was a

142
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:45,080
little different well what do you think

143
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:47,120
I do remember that situation I also it's

144
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,950
so cute how you're like actually trying

145
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,990
so hard for every question I think it's

146
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:52,580
cute that's why it's funny just be

147
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:56,060
natural you're doing fine

148
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:56,990
your egg looks good it's nowhere near as

149
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,700
dirty as mine

150
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:01,280
I draw how is James are coming a big

151
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:03,470
influencer at /pha mass changed her

152
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,660
guys's lives I think the major change is

153
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:08,480
him just not being with us all the time

154
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:11,660
because he's living in California but it

155
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:13,580
is very surreal for me when we are here

156
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:15,290
visiting him or when we were in New York

157
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:17,720
City a couple months ago people

158
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:21,530
recognized him stopped him and want an

159
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:24,200
autograph or a picture and to me to us

160
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:27,500
I'm sure he's just James and to the

161
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:30,980
world he's James Charles and it's kind

162
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:33,020
of cool to see that everybody just loves

163
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:35,660
him but yes it definitely is a little

164
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:36,620
scary a little scary as well so you guys

165
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,970
mention the last question helps

166
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:39,950
sometimes a little bit scarier for the

167
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:41,270
world to kind of like know me so this

168
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:43,100
question comes from Nicole and she asks

169
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:44,330
mama and father Charles how do you guys

170
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,980
feel about the hate James gets for

171
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:47,330
anything as a fan it always makes me so

172
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:50,480
mad but I'd like to know how you feel

173
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:53,060
it's it's terrible and because he's a

174
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:56,540
new quote-unquote celebrity we are not

175
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:58,850
used to this and I do I admit that I do

176
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:00,830
read the comments and it just breaks my

177
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:02,000
heart that there's so many people that

178
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:05,440
are so honest

179
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,670
people that are unique if you don't like

180
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,100
what somebody does or what somebody

181
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:12,830
believes in then that's okay but don't

182
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:16,250
don't be mean don't be cruel and it just

183
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:18,470
breaks my heart people are for the most

184
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:20,420
part that's why I don't participate in

185
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:23,870
any of that online stuff because as a

186
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:27,050
father you only have a couple of

187
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:28,700
responsibilities in your life one main

188
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:31,010
one is to make sure that your kids are

189
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:33,320
safe his safety has always been a

190
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:35,680
priority to me that's what scares the

191
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:40,490
hell out of me because just a lot of

192
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:42,590
time and that's always scared me school

193
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:46,190
bus I'm grateful for all his fans that

194
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:48,350
follow and protect him and support him

195
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:49,700
because it gives me strength to know

196
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:53,150
that there's plenty of people out there

197
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:58,130
that don't feel the way those selected

198
00:07:53,150 --> 00:08:00,110
few do so I'll be so down this one is

199
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:01,100
for you and in a lot of cases when it

200
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:02,810
comes to boys and beauty we

201
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:04,400
unfortunately see a lot of like horror

202
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:07,400
stories online about their fathers not

203
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,600
being supportive from sister Kalina Papa

204
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,940
Charles what was it like building

205
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,680
James's glam room and the basement I put

206
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:14,540
a mirror up and some makeup lights and

207
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,430
tried to do the best I could to give him

208
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:20,090
what he wanted his glam room used to be

209
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:22,340
my office it was so I had to move out of

210
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:25,070
my office pretty much which was no big

211
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:27,770
deal but that's what I do I build stuff

212
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:29,060
so it was no problem I had fun that was

213
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:30,470
I think a really cool experience to be

214
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:32,270
able to bond with my dad because we've

215
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:34,190
always been really close we boys built

216
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:35,300
stuff together but obviously like we

217
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:38,000
were talking about before makeup was

218
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:39,380
definitely a really rough patch for our

219
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,089
family when we kind of started off so

220
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:42,320
that was a really awesome just

221
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:43,490
experience that we had together because

222
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,350
it really showed that like they were

223
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:47,480
beginning to be way more supportive and

224
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:49,070
helped me in my career it was clearly

225
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,050
obvious that he was dedicating a lot of

226
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,430
time with a lot of energy to it and it

227
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:55,190
was gonna be something that he was going

228
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:56,570
to pursue so it just made sense to take

229
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:58,610
it to the next level and give him a

230
00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:00,440
better area to work and a different

231
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:03,050
setup so that's what we tried to do next

232
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:07,040
I'm going to use the morphe 35o palette

233
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:08,110
for some color on the eyes use code

234
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,590
James for tempers

235
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:14,170
that's right it daddy's awfully

236
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:15,810
concerned about his shadow worry about

237
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:17,680
daddy shadow

238
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:19,330
Karolina asked what was one thing you

239
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,050
didn't allow James to do it but he did

240
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:22,450
it anyway

241
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:26,620
wear makeup to school I would have to

242
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:28,840

your eye that goes on the bottom of the

top all right so I've never worn false

291
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:59,410
eyelashes before so I'm not sure if you

293
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:04,030

294
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:06,790
the mascara on to blend them together I

295
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:07,270
have no idea how to do this hey I think

296
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:09,070
I did it

297
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:10,780
I'm going to put this on and try not to

298
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:17,050
glue James's eyes shut

299
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:18,370
wouldn't be the first time Kim asked

300
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:20,740
what is your guys's favorite makeup look

301
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:25,060
that I've ever done my favorite is the

302
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:28,090
solar eclipse it was my idea but it also

303
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:30,960
was a very creative very cool look that

304
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:33,850
did well I believe to reveal its it okay

305
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:35,710
love marketing well Burnett there's been

306
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:37,860
a number of them I like the one with the

307
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:40,120
hand that was when he first started this

308
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,660
colleton yeah the skull that's like two

309
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,950
years ago

310
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,600
I know I just got that once one of my

311
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:44,920
favorite ones I thought was really cool

312
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,600
and I also liked the one with the matrix

313
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,940
that you the color matrix on your little

314
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,950
I thought that was extremely intense I

315
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:52,510
thought looks like my old yeah those

316
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:53,800
were some of my favorites when I was

317
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:55,000
younger and still had time to do a lot

318
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,590
of those creative looks I would go to

319
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,540
school all day for eight hours and then

320
00:12:56,590 --> 00:13:00,400
go home and do my homework and then go

321
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,960
to work at my frozen yogurt shop and

322
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,240
then sometimes go home and finish my

323
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,920
homework or if it was a really late

324
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,930
night sometimes do a makeup look and my

325
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,910
mom always goes to sleep at like 6 p.m.

326
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:12,400
so I'd I don't always be the one awake

327
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:13,990
so he was at 11:30 midnight is he come

328
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,100
upstairs to say what do you think so he

329
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:16,660
would always be the one to do the lux

330
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,220
before they would go live okay this

331
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:19,510
question is from sister Sebastian and he

332
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:22,320
asks what were the options for James

333
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:22,320
when he found out you were pregnant

334
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:28,360
