you mind your business you learned from

206
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:58,510
Mario actually favorite track Kim

207
00:07:54,820 --> 00:08:00,490
obviously now you have kkw which is it

208
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:02,169
so amazing and the products are so long

209
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:05,199
how I was like starting your own makeup

210
00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:08,139
line changed your career and your love

211
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:11,080
for makeup it definitely made me see

212
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:14,229
makeup in a really practical way I think

213
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:16,060
that a lot of people were really like

214
00:08:14,229 --> 00:08:18,010
the consumer was really scared of

215
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:19,990
contour but I know all my friends were

216
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:23,470
really scared of contour you're like

217
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:25,810
concealer in you know three steps and to

218
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:28,180
figure it all out so I tried to make it

219
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:30,700
as simple as possible and to try to

220
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:32,200
really explain that and bring like the

221
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:34,120
tricks that I learned

222
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,219
yeah with Mario about the years with

223
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,890
Mario to the consumer in a really easy

224
00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:40,630
way I love about super dope the whole

225
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:41,979
thing with our line is how to take like

226
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:43,719
the industry techniques and things like

227
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:45,339
that but simplify for the girls at home

228
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:47,230
so they can do it super easily right

229
00:08:45,339 --> 00:08:49,360
because like Kim there's a lot of girls

230
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:50,500
at home that you know are not like super

231
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,940
artistic when it comes to doing their

232
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,980
makeup and you know they just need

233
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:56,110
something easier so I figured I could do

234
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:58,360
it you can do it even though I've sat in

235
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:59,200
the makeup chair for you know 12 years

236
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,959
straight

237
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,700
I really didn't know a lot about I know

238
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:06,100
what I like to look at I know what I

239
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:07,760
like to feel I can tell what really good

240
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:10,490
formulas are and I think you know

241
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,980
with my k'kaw beauty brand we just have

242
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:14,120
really like perfected the formulas and I

243
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,830
just wanted something that was really

244
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,840
simple kanga Debbie's obvious like a

245
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:19,700
very social media-based brand to with

246
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:21,140
you and Barbie on switch media so much

247
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:23,660
how would you think social media has

248
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:24,980
affected the business I'm like what you

249
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:27,230
do on their day to day life if they feel

250
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:29,150
like obviously plays a huge role it's

251
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:32,150
really insane I mean it's fun to

252
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:33,980
obviously be in a store and to have

253
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:36,290
people come out and feel and touch and

254
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:38,150
use the product really you just honestly

255
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:39,830
you can it's so amazing to me that you

256
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:42,410
can start a whole business and a brand

257
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:44,660
fund just social media just creating

258
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:47,570
your own world and that's been so much

259
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:49,430
fun is having full control over ID

260
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:51,230
campaign images and who you work with

261
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:53,210
and what you do and what products you

262
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:55,820
pick and rotor packaging looks like and

263
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:57,380
it can be anything you want it to be and

264
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:59,570
if something doesn't work you can change

265
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:01,130
it is because you want like I don't know

266
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:03,740
if I'm mixing up like owning my own

267
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:06,260
business and social media but like the

268
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:08,990
both of them together has been so much

269
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:10,820
fun to have the creative control a

270
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:12,830
hundred percent but I honestly couldn't

271
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:15,260
have done it without Mario you know I

272
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:17,060
love his advice and his opinion has it

273
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:18,680
been interesting watching like different

274
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:21,080
makeup people like beauty gurus like try

275
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:23,300
the products in seven review it has just

276
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:25,640
like seeing that like my formulas we

277
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:29,180
take a lot of time and put into them so

278
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:30,500
seeing the response online or someone

279
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,820
that I really love and respect and

280
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,530
they're trying the shadows and they see

281
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:35,210
how pigmented they are they try the

282
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:37,250
lipstick and they say like my new

283
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:39,920
lipsticks or the liners or stuff they

284
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:40,850
use all the time like that makes me so

285
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,850
happy

286
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:44,930

look who's nobody were like a year and a

311
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,870
half ago almost two years ago now

probably yeah

313
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:40,990
so I wasn't super super nervous because

314
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:42,970
I was like kind of at the beginning of

315
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:45,220
like my makeup career like I think I was

316
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:46,930
only at like two million at the time of

317
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:48,100
three million maybe so I was like I had

318
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:48,430
never linked that like a celebrity

319
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,959
before

320
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:51,639
I always like looked up to you and like

321
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:55,499
watched Keeping Up and sucked so I was

322
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:55,499
so excited they put together I think

323
00:11:57,779 --> 00:12:02,589
yeah okay so are like your favorite

324
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:04,480
things to do with the kids my kids like

325
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:07,899
very different things so it's really

326
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,759
hard to do things all together oh my god

327
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:11,470
no this is the key to making up her song

328
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:13,720
I need we need to talk about ear and sat

329
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:15,519
down sorry from a few weeks ago that was

330
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,620
the funniest thing I've ever seen in my

331
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:22,179
entire life

334
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:30,519
cause this much of a big deal my makeup

335
00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:33,370
artists usually don't act this way yeah

336
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:36,050
he was very confusing because she said

337
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:38,629
she wanted to film a YouTube video

338
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:40,519
then okay I'll film it on my phone so I

339
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:42,439
started coming in and then she would see

340
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:45,379
the camera and then she fall out crying

341
00:12:42,439 --> 00:12:50,529

didn't like what she saw says she

345
00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:03,230

364
00:13:43,819 --> 00:13:48,110
good job like on herself but she's

365
00:13:45,949 --> 00:13:51,740
really into making her brows really dark

366
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:53,360
oh because I mean I have lots of

367
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:55,249
experience I feel a bronze to director

368
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,999
but she just takes a pen you know I'm

369
00:13:55,249 --> 00:14:00,559
just yeah that's pretty much what is you

370
00:13:58,999 --> 00:14:02,329
bought your stuff over there I've heard

371
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:04,850
a lot that I like not so cool so like

372
00:14:02,329 --> 00:14:06,889
you can give her tips how I would love

373
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:09,829
to wait all this right now she is she's

374
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:11,089
afraid okay so as she hadn't a jet where

375
00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:12,949
like she actually like wants her makeup

376
00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:15,170
her she just playing with that I mean a

377
00:14:12,949 --> 00:14:17,689
little bit of both like she's not fully

378
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:20,269
there yet where she's like I can't leave

379
00:14:17,689 --> 00:14:22,129
the house without you know rush on or

380
00:14:20,269 --> 00:14:24,529
whatever but she loves like a bright

381
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:27,199
colors lipstick and then if I go in on

382
00:14:24,529 --> 00:14:29,119
her like it's if it's like a special

383
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:32,989
occasion like her favorite color is

384
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:34,010
purple and Kylie had this color junebug

385
00:14:32,989 --> 00:14:36,020
and she

386
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:38,060
he would wear it all the time then Kylie

387
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:44,090
like made her our custom own purple

388
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:46,220
packaging so she'll wear like a lipstick

389
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:49,100
color out and then like she'll ask me

390
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:50,810
like 10 times is my lipstick still there

391
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:53,870
it's all there

392
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:56,090
can you see my lipstick is really cute

393
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:59,240
is there a evening cute like letter I

394
00:14:56,090 --> 00:15:02,000
start experimenting at maybe like 12 mm

395
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,440
maybe 14 I give this question a lot too

396
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,640
because I get a lot of parents that like

397
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,600
support my YouTube channel and say that

398
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,190
they watch the videos with their

399
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,050
daughter or sons which I always think is

400
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:11,060
so cool like it means a lot to me and a

401
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:12,410
lot of parents ask me like being like oh

402
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:14,060
well like what parent but what age did

403
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:16,160
you start wearing it I started at 16

404
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:17,360
doing my own makeup but I always say

405
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,710
like one of my biggest things that I

406
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,450
preach on my channel it's like I do not

407
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:21,500
wear makeup like to feel pretty I do not

408
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:23,330
wear makeup because I feel like I need

409
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:25,850
to wear a tie breaker because it's fun

410
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:28,190
yeah feeling beautiful and I love like

411
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:29,360
expressing my art and like playing with

412
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:31,370
it and seeing like what I can create

413
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,710
yeah and I think like because I get that

414
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:35,330
question so for me I owe a sailing if I

415
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:36,920
were to have kids which I never well I

416
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:43,880
would let them play with it whatever as

417
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:46,520
long as I knew like yeah and I think you

418
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:48,350
know the kids see me with with him

419
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:51,020
without makeup on all the time so they

420
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:52,580
know it's not like you know if anything

421
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:54,470
there was a point when I would get my

422
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:56,750
hair and makeup done and North which is

423
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:57,920
like start to cry and be like don't get

424
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,480
your makeup done

425
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,130
and cuz she knew that that's when mom

426
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:03,530
had to work right and mom was gonna

427
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:05,750
leave soon after that yeah so she hated

428
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:07,850
that but I really do agree with that

429
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:10,970
it's like just about being fun it's not

430
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:13,640
really I mean for me when I makeup on it

431
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:16,520
does transform my mood it transforms my

432
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:18,890
whole you know personality what does it

433
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:21,110
do exactly when you have a really

434
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:22,370
amazing makeup on as opposed to when you

435
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:25,250
don't have makeup on like what does it

436
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:26,499
do to you as a woman celebrity I think

437
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:29,229
that it from

438
00:16:26,499 --> 00:16:30,969
it makes me feel more confident when I

439
00:16:29,229 --> 00:16:34,119
have makeup on but I think it's the both

440
00:16:30,969 --> 00:16:35,949
I think it's like hair and makeup but if

441
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:37,719
you were to say you can only do one I

442
00:16:35,949 --> 00:16:41,109
would pick getting my hair done yeah

443
00:16:37,719 --> 00:16:43,029
because I do like natural beauty as well

444
00:16:41,109 --> 00:16:46,689
well me years ago I would have been

445
00:16:43,029 --> 00:16:49,119
makeup hair I think just like when my

446
00:16:46,689 --> 00:16:51,699
hair is done I feel like I can have a

447
00:16:49,119 --> 00:16:54,039
not more natural face I don't know I

448
00:16:51,699 --> 00:16:55,689
just think that when my makeup is done

449
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:57,729
like really good you just like feel

450
00:16:55,689 --> 00:17:00,699
yourself you know I mean you really do

451
00:16:57,729 --> 00:17:03,219
really get in to it you just aren't such

452
00:17:00,699 --> 00:17:04,959
a good mood it just enhances what you

453
00:17:03,219 --> 00:17:07,509
have what was the point I'll make out

454
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:14,019
yeah hey she said that only she doesn't

455
00:17:07,509 --> 00:17:15,039
want shimmer that's good yeah that's

456
00:17:14,019 --> 00:17:20,589
okay to do your own thing sometimes

457
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:22,000
isn't they wind up living in anyway well

458
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:27,850
if you pick the shiny end and the good

459
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,899
news is that he gets to redo this I can

460
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:31,000
when you are just getting ready and

461
00:17:28,899 --> 00:17:32,559
Mario isn't here and it's just you

462
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,330
how long does your LBD routine take you

463
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:39,759
you're really gonna die at this one

464
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:41,019
about seven minutes I can do a full face

465
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:43,570
in like five minutes

466
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:45,519
so she's um she's one of the most

467
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:46,779
incredibly patient people in Hindi good

468
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:48,309
in the universe such an incredibly

469
00:17:46,779 --> 00:17:49,570
common patient but she's just like when

470
00:17:48,309 --> 00:17:51,250
it comes to doing her own makeup she's

471
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:52,539
like not patient in that sense yeah I

472
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,980
just it just went you doing or something

473
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:57,639
it just says I'm just like who has time

474
00:17:53,980 --> 00:18:00,190
to blend all day yeah I just don't I

475
00:17:57,639 --> 00:18:01,779
wish I did she's very patient like with

476
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:03,549
other people working on her lately she

477
00:18:01,779 --> 00:18:06,789
doesn't really rushed people too much

478
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:08,080
so uh right now it's a challenge north

479
00:18:06,789 --> 00:18:10,480

485
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:23,170
she always wants to win okay me I think

00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:26,170
we ignored leave that I know kind of

487
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:28,390
fresh so because we're on a time limit

488
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:29,680
I'm not gonna do any cream contour I'm

489
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:32,650
gonna go ahead straight into the powder

00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:35,230
contour thanks father

491
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:36,790
because if this is contour viable

492
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:38,260
contour I'm usually thinking that me

493
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,800
Beauty reckoning powder this is the new

494
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,210
one the best

495
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:43,090
I still use this all the time ever seen

496
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:44,260
I love this powder it's so bomb you guys

497
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:45,940
been working together for a very very

498
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:47,230
long time now that's been incredible to

499
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:49,510
watch your guys's journey and like

500
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:50,920
almost you've created together how would

501
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:52,300
you say like your makeup style has

502
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,980
changed over the past few years and like

503
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:56,320
where do you see the industry Dali my

504
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:58,840
makeup style definitely goes in waves so

505
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,880
sometimes like we were super glam really

506
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:03,130
into a really light under eye that was

507
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,900
like our thing you know really smokey

508
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:07,720
eyes are lashes that we would wear would

509
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:09,880
be like only strips then we got to a

510
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:12,310
really natural place where it was like

511
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:14,380
hardly any shadow now we've started to

512
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:16,600
like glam it up a little bit more it's

513
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:19,570
always fun like what our papa blue or a

514
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:21,430
pop of color you know smokey eyes lots

515
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:22,780
of liner we definitely have like stepped

516
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:24,370
it up again are you just like messing

517
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:26,080
the glam yeah I mean I think it's just

518
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:27,910
like everyone you know you go through

519
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,650

521
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:32,530

00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:42,700
