00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,860
hi guys it's James Charles welcome back

3
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,240
to my youtube channel I really wanted to

4
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:23,320
film a really fun look this week so I

5
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,939
asked you guys on Twitter what you

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,309
wanted to see and almost all of you guys

7
00:00:24,939 --> 00:00:29,050
said do a challenge I do and I was so

8
00:00:27,309 --> 00:00:30,730
down I've been doing a lot of tutorials

9
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:32,710
so I thought it was finally time for me

10
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:34,600
to challenge myself and do a challenge

11
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:36,700
video a lot of challenges in one

12
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,770
sentence since I just got myself a new

13
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:40,809
pair of very very very pointy stilettos

14
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:42,219
I might be a perfect day to put my

15
00:00:40,809 --> 00:00:43,600
morphe brushes into retirement for a

16
00:00:42,219 --> 00:00:45,339
little while and do the no brushes

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,230
makeup challenge I decided to be this

18
00:00:45,339 --> 00:00:48,999
pinky rose cut crease with the glitter

19
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:50,920
liner and honestly I'm very very proud

20
00:00:48,999 --> 00:00:52,629
of how it turned out it was not easy but

21
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,069
I love the finished look so if you want

22
00:00:52,629 --> 00:00:55,809
to see her created this using not a

23
00:00:54,069 --> 00:00:57,940
single makeup brush make sure to keep on

24
00:00:55,809 --> 00:00:59,350
watching I'm gonna start out as always

25
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:01,359
priming my face using my benefit

26
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,319
Porefessional primer this is totally the

27
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,089
easiest step of this tutorial

28
00:01:02,319 --> 00:01:06,430
considering I always prime it using my

29
00:01:04,089 --> 00:01:06,909
hands anyway we're just what I like to

30
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:09,130
do it

31
00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:12,190
this is about to go downhill real fast

32
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:13,240
so brace yourselves for condition today

33
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:14,740
I'm going to use my makeup forever

34
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,060
Ultra HD foundation stick but I guess

35
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,830
since putting it on this way we kind of

36
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,930
be like cheating I'm going to rub it

37
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:22,990
into my fingers and then put it on that

38
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:24,190
way oh wow and now I guess we're going

39
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:27,100
to start to by the side of my fingers

40
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:30,120
okay okay this could be a lot worse this

41
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:32,320
is not as bad as I was thinking yet

42
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,760
knock on wood because we all know that's

43
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,230
gonna change in about 15 seconds

44
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,550
for concealer today I'm going to use my

45
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:37,930
two-faced we're on the suede concealer

46
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:39,430
in the shade very fair and I'm just

47
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:41,140
going to tap this in under my eyes and

48
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:42,790
all around the face using my own finger

49
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,960
once again well is this the first

50
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:44,950
challenge opening up my channel this is

51
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,110
not the first challenge I've actually

52
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:48,130
done I haven't tried a lot of the other

53
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:50,410
challenge that I've been floating around

54
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:52,210
YouTube but just in my own time they

55
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:54,940
have been very very fun but this one is

56
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:58,240
alarmingly dangerous with the set of

57
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:59,530
nails that I just acquired today I'm

58
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,090
going to quickly say under my eyes using

59
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:02,920
my code here some powder am at the shade

60
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:04,780
of translucent and once that's packed

61
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,920
under the eye just revising over to take

62
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:10,940
more about my entire hand and

63
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:12,410
really beat my face to contour my face

64
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:15,110
today I'm going to be using my Too Faced

65
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:19,430
milk chocolate Soleil bronzer oh holy

66
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:21,230
crap I'm feeling extremely patchy right

67
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,700
now and it's getting on my last nerves

68
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:24,319
but there's something I could really do

69
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:26,750
to fix that I guess so I'm going to go

70
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:29,060
ahead and bake my face using my fingers

71
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:30,850
once again in my co2 your thumb powder

72
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:32,900
[Music]

73
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:34,370
how many go ahead and let this week for

74
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,690
a few minutes fingers crossed this

75
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:37,970
contour gets a little bit cleaner

76
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:39,560
because it right now this looks awful so

77
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:41,750
I will be right back in a second we can

78
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,100
go on the rest of the face all right I'm

79
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:45,200
gonna go ahead and do you guys in so we

80
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,100
get started on the eyes to do this

81
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,989
problem I'm going to start off by

82
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,880
dipping my nail into a Nastasia dip brow

83
00:02:47,989 --> 00:02:54,459
in the shade evany this is where having

84
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:54,459
a lot of nails really is coming in handy

85
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:02,380
and then to tidy up the bar a little bit

86
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,970
I'm gonna take some room this way once

87
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:13,000
again on the tip of my finger nail and

88
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:15,190
just go under the brow I need you to

89
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,330
stay right there don't move once I have

90
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,500
the relative loopy and I'm just going to

91
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:19,090
take the remainder of the concealer on

92
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:27,910
my finger and blend that in as well as

93
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:30,340
cover my eyelid for my outlets today I

94
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:32,200
decided to do a cut crease I know I just

95
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:33,640
did one recently on my channel but I

96
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,740
wanted to do a little bit of a simpler

97
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,600
one for you guys at home and I know

98
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:38,890
Hokies will be super super hard to do

99
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,420
with just my fingers so I wanted to

100
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:41,920
challenge myself I'm gonna start off by

101
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,959
drawing that bottom line of the crease

102
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,500
using my fingernail and a cherry cola

103
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:46,500
from makeup geek

104
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,050
and then I'm taking a tiny bit of morphe

105
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:59,769
brick shadow and on my pinky I'm gonna

106
00:03:56,050 --> 00:04:00,910
start to blend in that line okay I guess

107
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:02,319
that's this ghost we're going to get so

108
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm gonna go back in now with cherry

109
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,110
cola once again on the tip of my finger

110
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,849
nail and to find that crease line a

111
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:08,200
little bit more this is definitely a

112
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:10,690
challenge to say the least and not as

113
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,190
easy as I was expecting getting to like

114
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:14,590
product in the flicks that I wanted to

115
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:16,510
is extremely easy having nails this

116
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:18,430
pointy but actually blending out the

117
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:20,590
product is extremely hard because I

118
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:24,400
really have access to my fingertips

119
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:25,540
because um the nails in the way and then

120
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,560
to finish off the cut crease I'm just

121
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:29,979
going to define it a little bit more

122
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,120
using anasazi a beauty mark behind of my

123
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:33,130
brow bone I'm going to mix together the

124
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,540
pink and the white shade from The Oprah

125
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:36,520
Beverly Hills highlighter

126
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,960
now normally I would go in with some

127
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,460
concealer underneath this crease just to

128
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,350
really really cut it and make it super

129
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,610
sharp but today I'm gonna be doing some

130
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:44,500
glitter liner underneath the crease

131
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:45,820
knives gonna be kind of my cut so I

132
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,200
don't even need to worry about it for

133
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:49,060
the glitter liner I'm gonna dip my nail

134
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,680
into my mehron mixing medium and just

135
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,419
draw a thin line right under the

136
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,130
concrete and then dipping right into eye

137
00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:55,660
candy glitter in a double bubble I'm

138
00:04:54,130 --> 00:05:01,210
gonna press that glitter right into the

139
00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:02,650
adhesive well I guess now we're going to

140
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:03,760
try to do a wing I am immediately

141
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:05,830
regretting this and I haven't even

142
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:09,010
started yet but I'm going to dip my

143
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:13,560
fingertip into more via gel liner in the

144
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:13,560
shade in Slate and pray

145
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:21,229
holy crap I can't believe I actually

146
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:22,880
just said that okay

147
00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:25,699
not the best wing liner but definitely

148
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,110
not the worst for my lower lashline Oh

149
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:28,550
goodies makeup geek bit and and just

150
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:33,919
quitted by pinkie and smudged out into

151
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:35,060
life oh okay so apparently that didn't

152
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,410
work too well so instead I'm going to go

153
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:39,259
to the bidding on at the tip of my nail

154
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:40,460
and bout that into my lash line I heard

155
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:41,840
like the lower lash line was missing

156
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:43,729
something so I just did my finger back

157
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,080
into the mayor of mixing game and into a

158
00:05:43,729 --> 00:05:46,910
double bubble and just pop it a little

159
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,990
bit on the inner corner her mascara

160
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:49,849
today I'm gonna be using my usual

161
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:51,229
benefit roller lash but since I can't

162
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:53,630
really use the spoolie tie brush I'm

163
00:05:51,229 --> 00:05:56,300
going to put some on my finger and then

164
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:58,520
try to apply it that way and pray that I

165
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:01,580
don't get it all over my eye hey this is

166
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:03,050
actually kind of working yes to finish

167
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:07,210
off the eye look I'm gonna pop on at the

168
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:07,210
bottom eyelashes in the style I go home

169
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:11,720
I'm gonna go ahead and do the other eye

170
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:13,190
off-camera now I promise I'm so gonna do

171
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,930
the challenge though this is much more

172
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:16,070
fun than I anticipated it's currently

173
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:17,300
2:00 a.m. but I have to wake up for

174
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:19,340
school in like 4 hours

175
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,110
lovely so I really need to focus and get

176
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:22,370
this done I'll be right back and we can

177
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:23,960
go ahead and finish the face and the

178
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:25,760
rest of the look okay there we go I

179
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,409

00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,120
minutes later but you know what they

181
00:06:27,409 --> 00:06:31,520
look good I'm happy with it

182
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,900
