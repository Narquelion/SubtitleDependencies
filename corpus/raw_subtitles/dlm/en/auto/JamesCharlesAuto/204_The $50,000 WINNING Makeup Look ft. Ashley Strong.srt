brand-new journey so I know with that

59
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,910
I'm gonna totally explain the white skin

60
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:26,320
I feel like that was kind of like way

61
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:29,050
too on-trend I want this to be more

62
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:31,300
inspired by not as literal as Mario says

63
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:32,769
so we're gonna do the colors instead of

64
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:35,080
the black and white we're gonna do what

65
00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:36,970
color you would put there looks like a

66
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,470
pink area for like blood like white fry

67
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:39,790
light yeah oh my god I leave out that

68
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:41,140
idea okay cool and then we'll just leave

69
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:43,180
the skin bare so just be like snatch

70
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:45,550
dope I'm never gonna do a half face yes

71
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:47,200
her face is good yep okay so what has

72
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:48,300
been like the biggest changes so far

73
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,160
since you announced it was made

74
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:54,160
obviously my engagement yeah I feel like

75
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:57,040
I blew up overnight and is super it's

76
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:00,370
like very in say influence or ass and I

77
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,660
think just like overall where I want to

78
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:03,430
go in the industry I think it's

79
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:05,739
definitely changed this is this has been

80
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:07,390
a super huge positive impact really yeah

81
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:09,010
anything new with like comments videos

82
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,970
like what'swhat's this situation because

83
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:11,890
I know earlier you're saying like you

84
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:13,420
feel like a lot of pressure now yeah now

85
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:15,310
I feel this unbelievable pressure to be

86
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:16,720
posting like super good juicy content so

87
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,739
I'm getting like a taste of what I feel

88
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,200
like you might be going through on a

89
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:21,760
daily basis like yeah so definitely

90
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,709
making sure that I mean remaining

91
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,209
interesting and open yeah is on the

92
00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:26,799
porphyrin that pressure and like that

93
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:29,290
drive to continue posting it's going to

94
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,549
be what keeps you growing in as folks

95
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:32,110
kept all the other contestants growing

96
00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:33,880
as well like for example like Kailyn as

97
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:35,140
well healings at like almost 300,000

98
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,610
followers by the time the mercury is in

99
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:38,739
can I have a second and I think like

100
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:41,079
she's written even over a million views

101
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:43,000
such good examples of like what the show

102
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:44,590
can do beyond you winning yeah you know

103
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,450
what I mean and how real is it that like

104
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:48,220
sometimes good that don't win right are

105
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:49,660
also just as successful if not more you

106
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:51,400
know what I mean so I think next we

107
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,900
should do the contour okay go for it

108
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,549
okay I want to know from you when we

109
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,620
finish talking first because I feel like

110
00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:58,069
it's gonna like what were your

111
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,390
expectations going into the show

112
00:03:58,069 --> 00:04:01,219
because obviously I've never done a

113
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:02,629
reality competition show before burn and

114
00:04:01,219 --> 00:04:03,079
like what was the experience like for

115
00:04:02,629 --> 00:04:04,670
you

116
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:06,590
honestly like I didn't have many

117
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:08,780
expectations but what I thought it was

118
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:10,489
gonna be like was like a big like Airbnb

119
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,139
and I thought you were gonna put all the

120
00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:16,579
contestants in like a house

121
00:04:12,139 --> 00:04:17,599
kind of like whole other side yeah so

122
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:18,650
that's what I thought was gonna be I

123
00:04:17,599 --> 00:04:20,419
thought it was gonna be more like blog

124
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:21,560
style just like more laid-back I when I

125
00:04:20,419 --> 00:04:23,360
got into the set it was like a

126
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,310
full-blown production and like I was

127
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,479
like whoa I was like did not expect that

128
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:27,620
how was your cruise on the show and you

129
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,789
can do this all your working as well be

130
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,530
watching well keep my mouth shut so you

131
00:04:28,789 --> 00:04:31,759
can speak the experience in the show was

132
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:33,199
super intense

133
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,449
obviously like I've never done a

134
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,160
competition show before you gave us no

135
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:39,349
time to adjust what he was like

136
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,090
immediately like next day my competition

137
00:04:39,349 --> 00:04:43,849
so I think for me it was just really

138
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:45,560
intense but what I will say is I learned

139
00:04:43,849 --> 00:04:48,130
new things about myself and how I work

140
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:55,930
under pressure yeah okay wait are

141
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:58,520
contour oh is the night cont no you know

142
00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:00,770
okay I want to know from you what do you

143
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,090
think was the hardest challenge on the

144
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:02,659
show and what was your favorite moment

145
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:05,630
from the show

146
00:05:02,659 --> 00:05:06,830
okay hardest challenge ooh let's see the

147
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:08,840
hardest challenge I think was probably

148
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:10,220
the first one really cuz it was the

149
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,840
first one yeah that was like the hardest

150
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:13,940
one it was like really gonna set the

151
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,139
tone for what you were looking for any

152
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,159
we were going to be able to like you

153
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:18,169
know I was actually gonna hear you

154
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:19,639
critique me yeah first time so I think

155
00:05:18,169 --> 00:05:21,800
it was gonna set the tone for like how I

156
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:24,139
was gonna compete it was such a cool I

157
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,449
mean so many other artists I mean like

158
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:28,280
Abe Reles luck was incredible for that

159
00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:30,110
as well really cool but I feel like

160
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,610
yours was not only artistic but I also

161
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:32,900
connected like I told me a little bit

162
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:34,250
about you and how you do percent

163
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,280
yourself as an artisan person and that's

164
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:39,289
what it was about so blush should be

165
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:47,539
here or like on top of it like more

166
00:05:39,289 --> 00:05:49,190
further back here is over that was your

167
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:53,509
favorite moment of the show and you can

168
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:55,159
do this while you're working winning now

169
00:05:53,509 --> 00:05:56,870
my favorite moment outside of that it

170
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:58,580
was in the finale and it was when Kailen

171
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:00,229

172
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:02,250

00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:30,940
shoutouts

186
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:32,920
oh my god Elessar ready dude yes of

187
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:34,840
course but mostly he's just proud of me

188
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,370
and I think that my son doesn't he won't

189
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,750
ever admit this probably but I think

190
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:39,370
that he does get a little bit inspired

191
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:41,260
about me just having a really unorthodox

192
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:42,850
lifestyle yeah you know I'm not your

193
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:44,560
typical mom I'm the cool mom

194
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:46,660
so I really want to learn more about

195
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,160
like just your Teen Mom dirty I thought

196
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:50,440
- do they like talking about that on

197
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,360
your channel 100% okay yeah I'm ready

198
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:54,280
for that I am totally I'm down to

199
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,390
dedicate a lot of time actually to

200
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,470
talking about it cuz I think that

201
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:58,090
there's so many moms that get

202
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:59,770
discouraged from this industry because I

203
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:01,540
don't think they can or they're not you

204
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:03,250
know I don't know there's like moms get

205
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:05,290
discouraged about so much like your mom

206
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,640
had some issues or she like you know put

207
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:08,380
some things on the back burner for you

208
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,480
guys so I think moms do that as an

209
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:13,120
instinct right not me baby we can have

210
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:14,590
it all that's all so that you are

211
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:19,180
excited like the hot to tell him that I

212
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:22,450
said hello yes oh my god I know it's

213
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:24,340
like whiteout whoa God mr. peanut really

214
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:27,640
knows how to make a good product

215
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:32,170
oh okay so do me a favor and just look

216
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:34,090
down okay we look at me again sorry okay

217
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:36,130
with them okay actually I have a fun

218
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:38,050
question especially since you are not

219
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:40,660
great at showing your boobs

220
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:43,690
what was your first impression of both

221
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:46,030
the contestants and the judges oh that's

222
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:47,830
a good one okay so actually I was in the

223
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:50,320
car with Caitlin first which is so funny

224
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:54,820
Oh were you yeah so we couldn't talk to

225
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:57,850
each other on the show but Caitlin can't

226
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:59,230
help it she's very like so much of a

227
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:01,150
person she couldn't talk to me but she

228
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:03,250
was talking to the talent manager and so

229
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:04,720
my first impression of Caitlin was she

230
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,460
talks when she's nervous yeah and then

231
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,410
when I first saw the other contestants

232
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:11,740
was like on set

233
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:14,020
so my first impression of indigo was oh

234
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:15,460
my god he looks like a Babbage like he

235
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,810
is definitely going like I kind of

236
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:19,180
targeted him as like my biggest threat

237
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:21,310
immediately I was he has a presence

238
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,240
about him in the real life definitely

239
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,680
one of the artists that I was looking

240
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,150
forward most to seeing I think he's

241
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,800
gonna take everything that happened with

242
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:28,479
the show and run with that oh yes I hope

243
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,979
he does he's the perfect example of like

244
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,050
you don't need to win to have success

245
00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:33,490
for sure but he I kind of sized him up

246
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:35,260
because he just has this aura about him

247
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:36,940
very bad [ __ ] vibe so I was kind of

248
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:38,919
like okay and then Benny

249
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:41,140
I've been protective and very maternal

250
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:43,479
over Benny since the moment I saw him he

251
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:45,190
was very quiet and kind of meek and

252
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:48,250
although he has a very big boisterous

253
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:49,870
personality his energy is very still an

254
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,950
eighteen year old so I felt really

255
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:52,390
maternal over him

256
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:54,250
yeah I didn't talk much with Gabriel

257
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:55,899
until actually after indigo went home

258
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:58,810
that's when Gabriel really started to

259
00:08:55,899 --> 00:09:01,510
show his personality to us he was really

260
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:03,910
quiet I was surprised he's very shy so I

261
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:05,620
actually mean Gabriel what you don't see

262
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:07,870
is that we had really long conversations

263
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:09,520
about like zodiacs and like crystals and

264
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:10,990
like the earth and the planet cuz I'm

265
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,400
into that kind of stuff too like no one

266
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:14,140
would ever know that but so my

267
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,370
impressions of Gabriel was that he was

268
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:17,080
really quiet and then after I got to

269
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:19,000
know him he was just actually a really

270
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:21,040
deeply caring person yeah my first

271
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,839
impression of Brittany was she had the

272
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,580
cutest style so Brittany had on like a

273
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:26,470
really cute little cropped like black

274
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:28,180
windbreaker and he's like cute ripped-up

275
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,410
high-waisted jeans so I actually looked

276
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:31,029
at Brittany and I was like oh my god

277
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:32,860
she's so cute which is like she's so

278
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:34,660
pretty that was my first impression brt

279
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:36,370
mm-hmm my first impression of you was

280
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:38,410
that oh yeah please tell me my first

281
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:39,850
impression of James was like this isn't

282
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:41,620
a YouTube channel like why is he talking

283
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:43,660
in real life like it just didn't

284
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:45,670
register to me and he looked like he was

285
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:48,010
still in his channel but in real life so

286
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:50,110
like very bright shiny super sparkly

287
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:53,589
that's what I like most sparkly in

288
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:55,240
person oh my god okay so concealer I

289
00:09:53,589 --> 00:09:56,260
don't know if it's not fit James I'll

290
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:00,150
show you to bake

291
00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:03,150
yeah right right to bake in this region

292
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:03,150
perfect

293
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,779
like the tick box where are you getting

294
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:09,779
your hair kind of the members

295
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:14,980

296
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:17,320
swear I'm cutting all your hair off

297
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:19,630
how was it when you got to watch the

298
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,430
episode to see the judgment deliberation

299
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:23,740
like that you weren't there for you guys

300
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:26,080
said so much to us like to our faces I

301
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:28,930
know so and nothing like shocked me

302
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:30,520
about it I think where I was like oh is

303
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:32,080
that in those moments we just had no

304
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,460
idea of what you guys were saying yeah

305
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,720
like we just had no idea how you guys

306
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:36,220
were coming up with the decision right

307
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,810
so the dance were like our long

308
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,860
deliberation yeah let's make sure we

309
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:40,540
made the right choice I guess I didn't

310
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:43,480
realize how much you guys you know put

311
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:45,700
into the making the decision so even

312
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,860
more privilege okay glad to know it

313
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:49,330
wasn't like a crazy shady no no no it

314
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:51,040
was good it was all right so Ashley just

315
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:52,930
apply to do lips to the lips and then

316
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,040
also added the other eye on camera so

317
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:55,480
even though we're gonna take the photo

318
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,580
half way just in case

319
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,990
a lot of TVs there are no angles you

00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:00,670

00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:01,840
