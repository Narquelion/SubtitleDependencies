makeup in front of me making a tutorial

00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,430
and I can't believe I'm doing this but

11
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,880
it's about damn time today I did this

12
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:38,129
blue brown and green trio chrome look

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,420

coming soon hi guys I'm gonna be

21
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,399
starting off today using my benefit

22
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,020
Porefessional primer I have a million

23
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,309
little bumps and pores all over my face

24
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,600
so doing this would really help me

25
00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:00,329
smooth everything out and get an even

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,859
foundation application next I'm going in

27
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:03,570
with my la girl pro color corrector

28
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:06,060
concealer in orange just to color

29
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,799
correct my 5 o'clock shadow and my under

30
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,150
eye circles if you don't have this

31
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,820
problem obviously don't color cracked

32
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:13,290
because this is not pumpkin glam but if

33
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,119
you're like me and you get negative 15

34
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,310
hours of sleep this might be for you I

35
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,840
also color corrected my acne spots using

36
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,430
a green color corrector also from la

37
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,939
girl and then blended it out with my

38
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:25,950
Beauty Blender now I'm going in with my

39
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:28,140
Make Up For Ever HD ultra foundation in

40
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,340
the shade Y 255 and just putting a bunch

41
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,020
of little dots all over my face

42
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,310
obviously we're gonna blend these out

43
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,400
later on but it just helps create a

44
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,659
really even application when you're

45
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,670
blending don't forget to blend on your

46
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:40,170
neck and on your ears too we want a

47
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,880
smooth transition and the last thing we

48
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:46,829
need is Moses parting the foundation see

49
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:48,479
on your face to highlight my face I'm

50
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:50,250
using my la girl Pro concealer in the

51
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,710
shade porcelain I'm drawing little

52
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,600
triangles on my face in the middle of my

53
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:56,700
forehead into the middle of my chin on

54
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,350
my mustache area and just one line down

55
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,460
the center of my nose this will just

56
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:01,079
make all the high points of my face

57
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,600
stand out and then once again at

58
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:05,100
blending out with my Beauty Blender now

59
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,360
I'm setting my entire face using Kodi

60
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,190
Ariston powder because I am done with

61
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,750
the liquids and creams this will help to

62
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:12,140
set everything in place and to reduce

63
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,730
crease edge

64
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:15,800
to further highlight my face I'm gonna

65
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:17,480
use my morphe 48 brush and this light

66
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,310
color for my lunatic cosmetics contour

67
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,840
lab this color usually comes in the

68
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:22,190
contour palette but I actually deep

69
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,510
potted it and just put it in my Z

70
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:25,130
palette with all my other contour and

71
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,480
highlight shades once again I'm just

72
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:32,690
putting this on all the high points of

73
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:35,360
my face to contour today I'm using my

74
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:37,430
morphe m-52 3 brush and my makeup geek

75
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,470
contour pans these colors are literally

76
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:41,930
so good and they are so pigmented I'm

77
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:43,970
using the shade warm fair today just to

78
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:46,730
create a nice basic contour and I'm

79
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:48,709
going on my cheekbones my 5 head and on

80
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:52,330
my jaw line to really carve everything

81
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:52,330
out and make my face look super defined

82
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,169
[Music]

83
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:04,640
next to further define my contour I'm

84
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,470
using the same brush as before and

85
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,910
makeup heat cocoa bear it isn't

86
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:09,230
eyeshadow but I never use blush in my

87
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:11,510
look so this really helps to just warm

88
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:13,489
everything up next I'm just making my

89
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:15,350
face using my once again Cody airspun

90
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:17,269
powder and my powder puff I'm just

91
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:19,459
drawing two really harsh defined lines

92
00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:20,269
from the tops of my ears to right above

93
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:21,680
the corner of my mouth

94
00:03:20,269 --> 00:03:27,410
this will help really carve out that

95
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:28,519
contour and with whatever's left on the

96
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:30,440
powder puff I'm just gonna put

97
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:32,239
underneath my eyes and in the center of

98
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,130
my forehead because I literally use so

99
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,049
much facial expression when I talk my

100
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:38,000
face creases so badly so doing this

101
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:40,820
helps decrease the creasing if that

102
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,530
makes any sense now to start the eyes I

103
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:44,390
did my brows off-camera just because I

104
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:46,310
tried and the angles turned out so bad I

105
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,690
promise I will do a prior tutorial later

106
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:49,430
on but for now we're just gonna stick

107
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:51,440
with this so to start off I'm using

108
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:53,690
makeup geek Peach Smoothie and my Murphy

109
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,549
and four-for-one brush just to get a

110
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:58,489
nice transition shade going in my crease

111
00:03:55,549 --> 00:03:59,030
for this entire look I use my morphe 35o

112
00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:01,070
palette

113
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:03,080
since the shades don't have actual names

114
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:04,370
I'll just be like describing them really

115
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,890
all you need to know is that I used a

116
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:08,360
light and medium and a dark brown to

117
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:09,380
create the halo eye effect and then

118
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:12,519
obviously I'm going to be going into

119
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,519
blues and greens later on

120
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:19,530
to further define that halo i i'm using

121
00:04:17,009 --> 00:04:21,600
my morphe m4 for one and once again just

122
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:23,130
a medium brown tone from the 35k palette

123
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,479
i'm putting that in the inner and outer

124
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:26,009
peace of the eyes and then just taking

125
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,810
whatever excess product is left and

126
00:04:26,009 --> 00:04:31,500
going in windshield wipers just to

127
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:34,620
define that crease now I'm using my

128
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:37,289
morphe M 509 and a darker Brown from the

129
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:39,750
35 k just to further define the inner

130
00:04:37,289 --> 00:04:41,490
and outer V's and once again the crease

131
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,780
same thing just really keep darkening

132
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:52,139
that halo eye and making sure there's a

133
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:53,729
nice even transition once I have nothing

134
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:55,080
on that brush I'm just going in my lower

135
00:04:53,729 --> 00:04:57,780
and upper lash line just make sure

136
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,940
everything is super blended out now for

137
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:02,009
the pop of color I'm spritzing my flat

138
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:04,229
definer brush with mac's fix+ and then

139
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:05,820
going into the makeup geek houdini I'm

140
00:05:04,229 --> 00:05:07,470
just packing this all over the center of

141
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:09,330
my lid and making sure to blend it up to

142
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:10,500
my crease but not playing it up too far

143
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:13,289
because we don't want it to get muddy

144
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:15,120
and gross looking next I'm going into

145
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:16,229
the typhoon it's a makeup geek dual

146
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,940
chrome eyeshadow it's just green and

147
00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:19,169
blue and I'm focusing that right on the

148
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:22,650
center of the lid and that's just with

149
00:05:19,169 --> 00:05:24,539
the tiny morphe definer brush I'm just

150
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:26,099
going back in with my M 509 and a dark

151
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:27,870
brown from the 35 K just to make sure

152
00:05:26,099 --> 00:05:31,470
that all the edges are super blown out

153
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:32,820
and there's no harsh lines in the

154
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:35,610
waterline I'm just going in with the

155
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:37,229
Italian deluxe eye pencil in turquoise I

156
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:38,430
got this at the morphe store if you

157
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:39,930
don't have this eye pencil you can

158
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:41,490
easily just do black it's really up to

159
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:43,440
you but I wanted another pop of color on

160
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:45,090
the bottom I actually lost the clip but

161
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,400
I did use the NYX jumbo eye pencil in

162
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:49,289
black bean just to mimic the halo effect

163
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,880
that we have going on on the upper lid

164
00:05:49,289 --> 00:05:52,470
and then once I did that I'm just going

165
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,970
back under the lower lash line to blend

166
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:57,389
everything out and connect it back up to

167
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:58,860
the top I'm just going in now with my

168
00:05:57,389 --> 00:06:01,169
favorite mascara benefit roller lash

169
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,340
it's so good it makes my lashes look so

170
00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:03,960
long and not clumpy so I would

171
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,639
definitely recommend I applied my

172
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,889
falsies off camera today I use the black

173
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:09,419
magic lashes in siren I ended up gluing

174
00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:11,130
my eye shot what I try to do on camera

175
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:13,320
so definitely not going to do that again

176
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:14,550
anyway a lesson learned this is the

177
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,780
finished eye look sorry for the walk you

178
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:17,159
lash but I'm going to go ahead and do

179
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:20,479
the other one off-camera and then we can

180
00:06:17,159 --> 00:06:20,479
go ahead and finish the face together

181
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:30,880
two highly I'm just fetching my brush

182
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:32,500
again with mac's fix+ to make it super

183
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,800
defined and then mixing these two colors

184
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:37,060
from my Anasazi aglow cap now we packed

185
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,100
out highlight on like there's no

186
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:40,389
tomorrow remember the goal is that your

187
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:43,290
highlight can be seen from space and

188
00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:45,520
that you blind everybody walking by I

189
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:47,139
always highlight my cheekbones the tip

190
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,200
of my nose and my Cupid's bow just

191
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:52,060
because I think it looks cute for my

192
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,890
lips today I'm using Oprah Brooklyn you

193
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:55,360
guys always ask what liquid lipsticks I

194
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:57,400
like best and they're definitely Oprah

195
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,870
the formulation is so good and they

196
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:13,600
don't dry crusty and gross like so many

197
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:15,040
other brands do as an optional last step

198
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,720
I went ahead and I added Houdini all

199
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,580
over my lips just for a cool Joe chrome

200
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,080
effect and that guys is the finished

201
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:21,760
