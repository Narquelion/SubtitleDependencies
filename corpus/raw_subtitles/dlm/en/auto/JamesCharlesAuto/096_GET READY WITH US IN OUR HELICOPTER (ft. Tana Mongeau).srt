19
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:45,870

and I love the ground

33
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:07,500
I needed a friend to talk to and almost

34
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:07,500
four hours late to the conversation

35
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:25,120
me to be a little more tape and no

36
00:05:23,620 --> 00:06:30,670
that's not a traditional friendship but

37
00:05:25,120 --> 00:06:32,770
that's definitely what a lot of you may

38
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:37,050
not know Buffy is I'm kind of always had

39
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:37,050
the business mindset that I do now I

40
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:51,270
made money off when I was 11

41
00:06:51,380 --> 00:07:59,960
I was like oh marketing is just to get

42
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:04,240
people really talking I think you're

43
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:06,080
very much the same way and this people

44
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,170
we're gonna keep coming back and

45
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:11,320
watching there's a lot of marketing that

46
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,320
goes

47
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,700
I think one of the people's and berating

48
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:17,140
things for me is that what other brands

49
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:25,390
work with me or somebody's posting about

50
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:29,190
me oh my god yes I absolutely have if

51
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:29,190
you took three seconds to do research

52
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:08,650
that's James Charles and I'm so sorry -

53
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:10,150
every single sister who likes makeup I

54
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:13,230
don't deserve to be here

55
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:22,210
you need like a Geoffrey start actually

56
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:25,260
service up here can't do my brows on the

57
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:25,260
ground let alone

[Music]

59
00:16:37,930 --> 00:17:07,400
okay like relative Oh everything one of

60
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:10,040
your compilation of all the routine I

61
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:13,550
make sure when taking the photo

62
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:15,410
- likely back to where like my shoulders

63
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:18,140
are significantly at an angle behind

64
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:20,420
like my legs and ass and then flex my

65
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:24,560
stomach muscles so that the first thing

66
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:47,390
I can do in space soon is details so it

67
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:58,820
looks like it's yellow like today where

68
00:17:47,390 --> 00:18:01,580
I got details it's very crazy though I

69
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:05,690
feel like in LA especially no one does

70
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:07,070
it okay that's why I think it's so funny

71
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:10,490
when I get called out for all the time

72
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:12,290
whenever it's like oh thank god hello

73
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:17,750
like I look amazing do you think I look

74
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:24,680
like that person but everybody I've seen

75
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:28,520
all your faves before and afters because

76
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:31,100
I edit a lot of people's pictures I just

77
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:35,170
know and since your days on the base

78
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:35,170
tune a lot of different people you guys

79
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:39,890
like when I see the reporters in this

80
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:43,510
what do you what do you guys think my

81
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:43,510
energetic oh you're

82
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:17,299
it's wrong with everything someone you

83
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:20,600
almost get into my zone which is toxic

84
00:19:17,299 --> 00:19:22,640
it's not okay but it's like it becomes

85
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,780
easier to just take the latter option

86
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,150
because you don't want to deal with the

87
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:27,440
criticism it's like people criticize you

88
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:29,630
until they push you to a point where

89
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,980
they for you to expect perfection of

90
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:32,539
yourself except when you're acting like

91
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:34,610
that they're mad at you and they call

92
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:37,240
you babe that's that brings us back to

93
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:37,240
our very first

94
00:19:51,350 --> 00:20:25,409
are you putting on boxes already first

95
00:19:53,760 --> 00:20:26,760
of all I could see us like getting good

96
00:20:25,409 --> 00:20:49,559
at this it's like doing your makeup in a

97
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:51,690
car I had to do it for red carpet oh my

98
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:56,899

00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:31,150
for the fact that we did this in a

103
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:32,920
helicopter I like my makeup generally

104
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:34,990
does not look that bad and I'm honestly

105
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:36,400
kind of happy with it but for being the

106
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:38,890
