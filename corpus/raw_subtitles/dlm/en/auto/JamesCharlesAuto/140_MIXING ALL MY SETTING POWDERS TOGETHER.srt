00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,480
hi sisters James Charles here and

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,470
welcome back to my youtube channel in

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,730
case you notice everything you might

4
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,410
look a little bit different right now I

5
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,919
slightly changed my setup and my letting

6
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,510
a little bit

7
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,980
I made the lights a lot less bright and

8
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,420
added a lot more diffusion so now I'll

9
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,519
hopefully be able to open my eyes and

10
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,410
not blink and close them every 3 seconds

11
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:17,580
come on camera I've got so many comments

12
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,350
about it I know it's annoying

13
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,550
you guys have no idea how much frickin

14
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,750
light was surrounding me in my previous

15
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,939
video so hopefully you guys like this

16
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,800
whole lot better but let me know a

17
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:27,269
sister is working on it anyways for

18
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,429
today's that I have something very very

19
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:31,080
fun plan that I'm actually so excited to

20
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:32,700
try out I've been seeing so many

21
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,530
youtubers lately doing videos testing

22
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,300
out mixing their different products

23
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,739
I saw Sophia [ __ ] testing up mixing her

24
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,360
foundation first and then she tested out

25
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:41,309
mixing her liquid lipsticks to get a

26
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,899
funky color so for today's video I'm

27
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:44,640
trying something a little bit different

28
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:46,440
and I'm gonna mix together all of my

29
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,940
setting powders if you guys been a

30
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,489
longtime sister you know that setting

31
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,680
powder is a little bit of a touchy

32
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:53,940
subject for me when I first started

33
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,770
doing my makeup I use the Cote air

34
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,449
somehow too religiously and we all know

35
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,710
how that turned out so this one is

36
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:00,390
slowly made its way out of my routine

37
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,920
now I use the Laura Mercier translucent

38
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,780
setting powder in almost every single

39
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,549
video but I've tried out so many

40
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,840
different powders in between some of the

41
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:08,310
remotes have mattify some of them are

42
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,290
meant to brighten some of them prevent

43
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,640
creases but overall the whole purpose of

44
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,500
them is that they set the face in place

45
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,549
today I'm gonna be mixing together all

46
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,140
my setting powders they have in my

47
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:17,790
collection both my favorites and the

48
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,229
ones that have given me a little bit of

49
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,939
trouble in the past and this empty

50
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:22,369
setting powder container we're gonna mix

51
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:24,840
them all together and then we're gonna

52
00:01:22,369 --> 00:01:26,549
set my face in place that actually kind

53
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,320
of hurt I'm really not sure how this is

54
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:29,640
gonna turn out just on my first thoughts

55
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,430
I am assuming that it's probably gonna

56
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,320
be ridiculously dry like it's a hair

57
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,520
desert level I do have my setting spray

58
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,930
just in case everything gets a little

59
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,939
bit too serious or my face is like you

60
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,189
know cracking off because won't be that

61
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:42,869
big of a surprise but who knows I also

62
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:44,880
feel like I probably I'm gonna get

63
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:47,280
pretty bad a flashback today hopefully

64
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,420
Mary will not come back to play I do

65
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,890
have to wear this makeup to an event

66
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,750
later on tonight but I'll be taking you

67
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,070
guys with me to show the full thing I'll

68
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,100
also be taking a lot of photos so

69
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:57,570
hopefully none of them turn out too bad

70
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,829
anyways all being said if you'd like to

71
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:00,210
see all my setting powders being mixed

72
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:02,310
together put them to the test

73
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:04,320
will it work will it fail will flash

74
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,260
like Mary make an iconic appearance keep

75
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,400
on watching

76
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,400
[Music]

77
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:12,150
so before I actually go into my

78
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,650
foundation today my first step is gonna

79
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,430
be to go into the touch of water cream

80
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,560
which is my all-time favorite

81
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:17,580
moisturizer as I was just talking about

82
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,590
obviously the whole point of setting

83
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,420
powder is to dry foundation down and sat

84
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,590
waiting in place and I definitely do not

85
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,450
want to be the Sahara Desert

86
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:26,250
today my skin is just arting to clear up

87
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,020
a little bit so I'm trying to protect it

88
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:30,270
therefore I need to be really really

89
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:32,310
hydrated before I suck all the moisture

90
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:33,660
out for foundations today I'm gonna grab

91
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:35,100
my all-time favorite my makeup for ever

92
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:38,190
ultra HD stick and this is in the shade

93
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:39,870
of Y 335 I am using a stick shade that's

94
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:41,280
slightly darker than my normal shade for

95
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:43,140
them I do have a bad feeling this is

96
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,760
gonna give me a really bad a flashback

97
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,560
today so I'm trying to combat that as

98
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,820
much as possible then I'm just gonna add

99
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,290
a few drops of the Giorgio Armani

100
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:51,120
luminous of Foundation and use this to

101
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:52,709
kind of blend that foundation out this

102
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,730
is a very very dewy foundation and once

103
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:57,870
again we're trying to add the most

104
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:58,950
amount of moisture possible then just to

105
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,209
brighten quickly I'm gonna use my shape

106
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:05,310
gave concealer in the shade up light

107
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:06,690
stand as usual so now that we have my

108
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,220
foundation and concealer all in place

109
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:09,930
let's go ahead and mix all these setting

110
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,370
powders together I have an empty tub

111
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:13,709
right here that is ready for this

112
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:14,940
concoction the first part I want to add

113
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:17,040
is my all-time favorite which is my

114
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,860
Laura Mercier I have some one the top of

115
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,790
the jar right here so I'm just going to

116
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:22,980
pour that in and then I'm just gonna

117
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:25,260
like a little bit of a tap just make

118
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:26,640
sure we have enough in there next I'm

119
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:28,830
going to add the two phase two peach

120
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,070
perfect setting powder whoo that is a

121
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:33,060
mouthful this one smells literally so

122
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:35,160
good and actually smells like real

123
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,840
peaches I love this one as well the only

124
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,550
thing is this is a little bit orange but

125
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,080
that may help with combating like dark

126
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:41,730
circles especially under the eyes and in

127
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,380
the beard area so this could be a good

128
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:48,269
addition I'm just gonna tap a little bit

129
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:49,950
of that powder in there next one to add

130
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:51,690
a little bit of the beauty bakery flower

131
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:52,980
setting powder I've actually never tried

132
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,570
this one out but I've heard amazing

133
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:58,050
amazing things about it so hopefully

134
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:59,250
it'll be just as good for me next comes

135
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:01,380
in powders that I either don't like as

136
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:03,510
much don't sit well on my skin or gave

137
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:05,670
me flashback our burst can afford a

138
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:07,049
little bit of the RCM A&O color powder I

139
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:09,060
did not like this one as much it clung

140
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:11,360
to my skin a pretty bad oh my god

141
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:14,069
and also did way too much brightening so

142
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:18,229
who next will be the tarte smooth

143
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:18,229
operator Amazonian clay finishing powder

144
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:22,110
neck's is gonna be one of my all-time

145
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:23,910
least favorite setting powders which is

146
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:26,520
the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD setting

147
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:27,810
powder listen I love makeup forever they

148
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,430
are an amazing team they have a lot of

149
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:31,470
amazing products I use their foundation

150
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:34,200
in every single look but this powder is

151
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:36,300
just really not a good one at all I know

152
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,830
it does give it very very bad flashbacks

153
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,170
so I'm probably gonna have to stay away

154
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:44,220
from this app chat tonight I'm just

155
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:46,770
gonna pour a little of this one in and

156
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:56,640
last but certainly not least we all know

157
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:57,990
this one mmm yes we do that's enough

158
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,850
so that is all seven of our setting

159
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:01,620
powders mixed together today I am very

160
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:05,130
very scared for this but I'm gonna put

161
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:06,750
the cap back on and we're going to shake

162
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:10,400
it up sick sick sick

163
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:14,850
Oh shake shake shake shake your powder

164
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,930
shake your powder I need to stop so

165
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:17,010
looking at the powder in the jar it

166
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:18,300
definitely looks like a normal setting

167
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:20,040
powder although it does look a little

168
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,300
bit chunky I'm really not sure if that's

169
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,190
because I just shook it to mix it

170
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,270
together or if it's because the foreign

171
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,770
laws are the powder aren't mixing

172
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:27,450
together hopefully it's not option

173
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:29,310
number two but I guess we're gonna find

174
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:30,870
out in a short second also the color

175
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:32,040
looks pretty normal as well but I will

176
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:34,080
say it does look a little bit more

177
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,340
orange than normal the Cody are some

178
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,260
powder and that two-faced peach powder

179
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,640
are both slightly orange II peachy tone

180
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,780
and hopefully that doesn't affect my

181
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,340
color shade they can be look like an

182
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,350
oompa loompa then I'm just gonna go

183
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:46,650
right into my Beauty sponge dip right

184
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:49,350
into this powder and set my face that's

185
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:50,970
really matte whoa then of course you

186
00:05:49,350 --> 00:06:04,440
guys might like to rock it on the nose

187
00:05:50,970 --> 00:06:05,850
choice any water oh my god I was I think

188
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,080
I like to really really pocket on the

189
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:09,060
nose that's always the one thing on my

190
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,110
face that gets oily the fastest this

191
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,820
feels like a normal setting powder to

192
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:13,710
apply but I'm not kidding when I say

193
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:15,960
that I can literally like taste the

194
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:17,400
peach in my mouth I don't know if I put

195
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,800
too much of the peach powder and Orvis

196
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,090
just actually that strong but regardless

197
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,470
I do like that setting powder so

198
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:24,360
hopefully it's working in my favor

199
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:26,310
things were definitely getting a little

200
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,360
peachy up here in the sister studio so

201
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:29,910
looking close up with my skin in the

202
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,120
mirror I look very very matte there's

203
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:33,900
like

204
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,430
not a single trace of Oh oh my god okay

205
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:37,020
not only do I look mad but I also feel

206
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:38,430
mad - holy crap

207
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,290
looking clothes everybody knows wherever

208
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:41,790
there is a - spots right here with the

209
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:43,860
foundation there's a little bit worn off

210
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:45,540
there were two little specks of setting

211
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,680
powder that wouldn't go away and I'm

212
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:48,180
assuming that's from the RCM a powder

213
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,919
because I remember that happening a lot

214
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,330
when I use this powder and like stuck to

215
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,680
my foundation and when I rubbed it away

216
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:53,820
now I'm left with a little bit of

217
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,260
discoloration right here so hopefully

218
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:57,000
I'll be able to fix that when it comes

219
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:59,070
to the most contouring later on but I

220
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
knew I didn't like this powder before we

221
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:01,290
make my face I'm just gonna go in and

222
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,060
I'm going to contour and bronze my face

223
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:04,470
normally using my Kat Von D shade and

224
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,010
light palette and my benefit hoola

225
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:06,900
bronzer

226
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:08,400
as always once we're onto is it of

227
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,780
course we have to bake our face so I'm

228
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,729
gonna get my blending sponge once again

229
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,979
for morphe and dip into our custom M

230
00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:15,810
powder concoction right up in here and

231
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:18,120
we're going to turn on the oven at 350

232
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:19,800
degrees and bake it up the point of

233
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,479
baking is not only to prevent creases

234
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,760
but it's also to brighten and add a

235
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:25,080
definition to makeup so with the

236
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,400
addition of the makeup forever setting

237
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,900
powder which heavily has a lot of flash

238
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,880
like and a lot of lightness and also the

239
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,169
RCM a color powder which is white

240
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,150
hopefully this will do a really really

241
00:07:31,169 --> 00:07:33,960
great job with that and not make me look

242
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:36,000
disgusting

243
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,050
while we are baking at 350 degrees in

244
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,760
the oven I'm gonna go ahead and quickly

245
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:40,139
do my eyebrows off camera just to save

246
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,599
some time always some eyebrows were all

247
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:44,849
saved in place it has been about 20

248
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:46,470
minutes now so let's go ahead and wipe

249
00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:52,680
off the bake and see how this powder

250
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:53,729
actually held up a hole so far so good

251
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,960
everything is still really really

252
00:07:53,729 --> 00:07:56,190
Merritt and set in place and it does

253
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,990
look a little bit brighter if you see

254
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:59,460
like underneath this contour but I feel

255
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:01,919
like the true test is definitely the

256
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:03,690
nose contour so let's wipe this off as

257
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,280
well obvious I mean to me it looks like

258
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:06,750
my normal nose contour I mean I did tell

259
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,130
you guys I lost my nose contouring brush

260
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:10,500
so things in that department and general

261
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:12,120
have been a little bit wonky but over

262
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,710
life like it looks really really good

263
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,000
it didn't cling on to my skin at all

264
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:16,380
which is the thing that I was very very

265
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,539
worried about everything looks really

266
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:19,770
nice bright side play so so far I

267
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:21,300
actually have no complaints

268
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:22,680
I'm gonna give my face a light misting

269
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,389
of the Scandinavian makeup finishing

270
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,919
spray just to make all the powders kind

271
00:08:24,389 --> 00:08:27,870
of melt together because lord knows we

272
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:29,070
have a lot of it on right now I'm gonna

273
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:30,419
go ahead and do the eyes and the rest my

274
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:31,710
face off-camera and then I'll be right

275
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:32,969
back with the finished look then we'll

276
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:35,430
put the setting powder concoction to the

277
00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:37,289
true test and see our seven powders mix

278
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:38,230
together sister approved we'll have to

279
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:40,360
find out

280
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:41,860
and only a few hours later this is the

281
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,300
finished that I came up with today I

282
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,800
came up with this purpley half cut

283
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:47,020
crease and I added a winged liner as

284
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,520
well I haven't done purple or a wing in

285
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,990
such a long time and honestly I just

286
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:52,450
felt like I was missing something in my

287
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:55,000
life I needed that purple smokiness that

288
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:56,500
cut winged liner and I am in love with

289
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,670
on this look turned out just in case

290
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,980
you're wondering I catered it using the

291
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:01,120
brand new morphe 15 and palette this is

292
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:03,100
Dean bytes thinner palette from the

293
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,930
holiday collection and it is so so

294
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,640
stunning friendly Randy you can use code

295
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:08,020
James for 10% off all morphe products

296
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,670
and the Holiday Collection I would

297
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:12,010
definitely recommend this so look at my

298
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:13,450
face in the mirror I am very very matte

299
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:15,760
there was no question about that

300
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:17,260
literally dewy skin never heard of her I

301
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,460
have literally no shine anywhere on my

302
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:20,080
face except for obviously the place I

303
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:21,460
put highlighter but I feel like even my

304
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,170
highlighter today is not shining as

305
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:25,990
bright as normal because we layer it on

306
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:28,180
so much powder before hand honestly my

307
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:29,620
face feels really really secure like I

308
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:31,810
said earlier it even feels matte like

309
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:33,670
it's super super dry so honestly I feel

310
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:34,240
like this may last for a very very long

311
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:36,250
time

312
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,390
but I have literally no idea we're gonna

313
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,250
put that to the test

314
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:41,170
so I'm gonna go get change this outfit

315
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:43,060
is a little bit dusty if I do say so

316
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:44,200
myself I'm gonna put on a hat and jacket

317
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,730
because I have a birthday dinner tonight

318
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,500
over in Malibu to celebrate sister

319
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:49,390
Patrick stars birthday I love him so

320
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,910
much and we're gonna be wearing this

321
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:53,350
makeup all night will it flash oh oh my

322
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:54,940
god before I leave let me take a flash

323
00:09:53,350 --> 00:10:02,440
test right now before we actually leave

324
00:09:54,940 --> 00:10:04,330
the studio that's your test it didn't

325
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:06,100
flash back not even gonna lie I'm a

326
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:07,240
little bit shocked right now I a hundred

327
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,530
and fifty percent thought we were gonna

328
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,540
have a flash like merry situation

329
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:12,130
tonight I was really really ready to

330
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,780
take a whole lot of snapshots how's the

331
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:16,120
internet go crazy once again only to use

332
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:18,130
it for video promo for this video but

333
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,450
this is not a bad thing that being said

334
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:21,250
even though it's not flashing back now

335
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:22,930
and may flashbacks later on as the

336
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:24,400
powder wears down and we make it creases

337
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,000
so like I just think before I got

338
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,110
sidetracked

339
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,460
I'm gonna go quickly get dressed for the

340
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:28,810
event tonight and I'm gonna head out and

341
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,130
I'll make sure to keep you guys posted

342
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:32,050
all throughout the night with lots of

343
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,490
updates with my sisters and friends will

344
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:34,930
this mixture of the seven most popular

345
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:35,830
setting powders stay looking amazing

346
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:38,170
like it does right now

347
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:40,330
or will it get crazy and Crocky and

348
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:41,050
gross and cakey you'll have to find out

349
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:42,880
okay

350
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:45,190
sisters we're here at Nobu I have

351
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,050
sisters carrot and crispy and Sydney I'm

352
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:48,470
gonna ask all of you individually what

353
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:49,940
do you think about my skin right now

354
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:52,129
I think you look very good he looks very

355
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:54,079
snatched skin let's put together a

356
00:10:52,129 --> 00:11:04,069
little more matte than usual very matte

357
00:10:54,079 --> 00:11:05,870
full coverage personally I love here

358
00:11:04,069 --> 00:11:08,990
with sister Yoli glow the woman who

359
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:10,189
slays my skin all the time Yoli what do

360
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:19,850
you think about my skin right now like

361
00:11:10,189 --> 00:11:21,560
what does it look like I approve so this

362
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:24,470
is a powder that emphasizes texture you

363
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:27,439
guys in achieving an amazing job because

364
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:28,459
it's really emphasizing oh and you don't

379
00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:14,940
hello sisters and back home from the

380
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,470
birthday event that was literally so

381
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:18,510
much fun I have reading on right now

382
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:20,040
because it was literally so cold outside

383
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:22,080
I'm actually so happy that it's finally

384
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,790
getting cold in LA I thought I was gonna

385
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:26,250
be summer all year round but wintertime

386
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:27,960
is coming and it's currently 11:47 p.m.

387
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:29,910
meaning I've had this makeup on for just

388
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:34,290
over seven hours now which is crazy

389
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:36,270
because guys this looks so good I did

390
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:37,800
not touch up once tonight this is the

391
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:39,540
first time since I started wearing

392
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,950
makeup and going to events that I did

393
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,420
not bring a beauty blender with me to

394
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:45,810
even like do some touch-ups or to powder

395
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:48,029
my face and this still looks so bomb I

396
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:50,070
can't frickin believe how mad it looks -

397
00:12:48,029 --> 00:12:51,630
like there's literally no oil at all

398
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:54,900
like not even on my nose and you guys

399
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:57,150
know so chef James's nose is usually a

400
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:58,140
problem place everybody that I asked out

401
00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:00,060
my skin tonight said that it looked

402
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:01,830
really really smooth really really good

403
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:04,020
really really full-coverage and really

404
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:05,700
really mapped I mean obviously we did

405
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:07,770
mixed together 7 powders to set my face

406
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:09,570
today I hate to say it because I

407
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:11,880
honestly really thought this is gonna be

408
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:13,529
a complete joke but as you saw not a

409
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:16,050
single one had flashback my skin looks

410
00:13:13,529 --> 00:13:18,089
smooth it still looks smooth it's still

411
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:20,190
dry it's still not guys I think I just

412
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:21,330
found my new favorite makeup trick this

413
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:23,100
is obviously the first time that I've

414
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:24,480
ever mixed setting powders but after

415
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,529
trying this trick out I honestly do

416
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,510
think I'm gonna make it a custom

417
00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:29,250
concoction to use for everyday use I'll

418
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:31,560
probably end up mixing my Laura Mercier

419
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:33,180
my Too Faced peach perfect and then a

420
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,500
little bit of the Cody err some powder

421
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,660
because these are my all-time favorites

422
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,040
I don't know about the are CMA or the

423
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,360
maker for everyone because these do get

424
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,980
pretty bad flash like and this was a

425
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,720
little bit clingy and I think that I'm

426
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:44,130
gonna have to test out the Beauty bakery

427
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,390
one a little bit more as well because

428
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:47,070
obviously I've never actually used this

429
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:48,390
on its own so I definitely want to see

430
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:50,520
how it actually wears before I put it

431
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:51,750
into the baked concoction but you

432
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:53,190
see convicted setting powders I think is

433
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,360
a really really cool thing that I can't

434
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:55,740
believe it actually never thought of

435
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,390
obviously the whole point of mixing them

436
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,830
is like to get the best of all worlds of

437
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:59,850
all the different setting powders so I

438
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:01,560
really really like this check and

439
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:02,640
definitely recommend to you guys if you

440
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,200

442
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,360
