nastier and nastier and this was a while

147
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,629

full circle which is like everything

183
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:55,009
well I think that rainbow and I do

184
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,330
address obviously some like more serious

185
00:06:55,009 --> 00:06:57,710
things that I had quite frankly with

186
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:59,230
sick of hearing people be like oh you

187
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:01,920
can't say you can't say when we're

188
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:04,690
using autotune is like a very obvious

189
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:06,370
yes we weren't trying to hide any of

190
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:07,990
that so I'm rainbows I just really

191
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:10,600
wanted it to be like there's no effects

192
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:12,130
there's no kind of gimmicky stuff

193
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,320
happening it's just my voice my

194
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:17,050
songwriting and little more serious on

195
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:18,460
this album I just wanted to like you're

196
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:20,080
allowed to be happy we're all allowed to

197
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:21,520
be happy and we all should be happy and

198
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,470
doesn't matter if you go through

199
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,330
something that's terrible and you may

200
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:27,700
never get over it but you can try to

201
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:29,080
move on milik present and happy and

202
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,370
joyful in here in the fact that we're

203
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,750
alive today that's something that

204
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:32,860
personally I'm struggling with a lot

205
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,090

266
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,360
anything to your brows to be right on

267
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:12,360
those yeah I think it looks really good

268
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:19,600
okay so first of all love the clothes

269
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,040
right at the top I love that you did not

270
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,280
just release a palette of neutral colors

271
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,700
like I couldn't know right and that's my

272
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,870
heart

273
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,920
there are a lot of people that are

274
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:28,600
releasing make appliance which i think

275
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,920
is amazing because it's always fun to

276
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,270
add new things to the market but at the

277
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,230
same time I think that there's also

278
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:33,730
something would really make apply

279
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:35,650
instead it doesn't quite make sense I

280
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:40,300
think this makes perfect sense for you I

281
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:42,130
mean yeah so I really had to understand

282
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:44,860
what people would want from me right

283
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:48,310
when I think of Tessa I think of a party

284
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:49,990
crazy colorful glitter because very

285
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:52,180
grateful you put a few glitter yeah they

286
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:53,410
can go like on top of whatever a daytime

287
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:55,119
look you have going on or

288
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:56,349
intensify or whatever my feelings makes

289
00:10:55,119 --> 00:10:57,789
a lot of sense for you and your brand so

290
00:10:56,349 --> 00:10:59,649
I was very excited to see that because

291
00:10:57,789 --> 00:11:01,359
it just like feels very genuine okay

292
00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:02,499
and I wonder singly beautiful today I

293
00:11:01,359 --> 00:11:03,999
thought it'd be really fun to do a

294
00:11:02,499 --> 00:11:06,249
matching outlook tool that I have on now

295
00:11:03,999 --> 00:11:07,449
but do a pop of blue because this is

296
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:09,849
literally one of the most stunning

297
00:11:07,449 --> 00:11:11,349
shadows that I've ever seen on the lower

298
00:11:09,849 --> 00:11:13,869
person instead of the green and maybe on

299
00:11:11,349 --> 00:11:16,179
some glitter in there too beautiful and

300
00:11:13,869 --> 00:11:17,919
like fun fact any of the matte ones if

301
00:11:16,179 --> 00:11:20,109
you had water to them they become way

302
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:21,369
more pigmented really oh just don't have

303
00:11:20,109 --> 00:11:23,049
a fun track for all that and then the

304
00:11:21,369 --> 00:11:26,199
shimmer you know they're super shimmery

305
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:27,279
but play and see what we can come up

create I'm making one in the first place

337
00:12:34,749 --> 00:12:40,380
so I feel like I've had so many kinds of

338
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:42,600
makeup on my face for it's been like 10

339
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:44,399
years yeah I've always loved makeup and

340
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,800
I love color and I love playing and I

341
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:49,529
love ironically a lot of my influences

342
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:52,680
are actually men that use makeup just

343
00:12:49,529 --> 00:12:54,390
totally like incorrectly mm-hmm but I'm

344
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,250
really inspired by people that utilize

345
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:59,160
what they want how they want just so

346
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:00,690
many different ways to use makeup that

347
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:04,440
doesn't have to be about looking like

348
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:06,720
this perfect super femicide all approved

349
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:09,120
thing it's more about expressing what I

350
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,290
like and like what color I feel today I

351
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,430
just use a little bit of cannibal which

352
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:15,870
is the bright red shade which by the way

353
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:16,860
is so beautiful I love about that and

354
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:18,630
then I'm now gonna grab a little bit of

355
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:20,399
a buggy feet on a fluffy brush and I'm

356
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:21,810
squinted buff out to the edges how did

357
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,850
you choose the different shades for the

358
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:24,420
palate so I wanted to think about what I

359
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,980
wear

360
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:28,110

few months ago I was playing Minecraft I

372
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,690

Kasia and I literally screamed and I I

375
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:57,330
was live and I was like what is going on

376
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,160

00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:03,540
anybody was watching this you guys will

379
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,620
know now was the first thing that I said

380
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:06,540
was if she doesn't have a glitter I'm

381
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:08,339
not doing this they're lovely you have

382
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,690
multiple shades of glitter and jammers

383
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:11,550
and then some matte just but yeah I

384
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:13,740
wanted to give people a variety so I

385
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:16,320
wanted to have it really colorful but

386
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:19,020
also have like the basics like a black

387
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,550
you can always just slap on a smoky eye

388
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:26,070
and sleep in it and wake up and just

389
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:28,440

390
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:30,690

393
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:40,050
like on my leg Cupid's bow oh we should

394
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:47,640
try that on the cheekbone it's gonna cut

395
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:50,100
the edge okay I want to test out this

396
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:52,680
whole little water theory yeah so what

397
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,820
you do is divot just lightly okay and

398
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:56,130
then which color are you going for it

399
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:58,079
knocks over okay so get a little wet

400
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:59,970
make it kind of pasty great Nick it's a

401
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,890
little darker one more tense I'm gonna

402
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:04,920
use this to lie your upper lash line and

403
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:06,269
create almost a wing but definitely okay

404
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,160
so I'm gonna grab my little pencil brush

405
00:15:06,269 --> 00:15:09,540

little bit of pageantry and below just

415
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,750
to kind of blend it out a little bit so

416
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:35,459

417
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,959
into the lower lash abundant than just

418
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:41,550
