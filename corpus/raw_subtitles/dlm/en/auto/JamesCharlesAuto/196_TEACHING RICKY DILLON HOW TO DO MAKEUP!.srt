170
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:54,680
dip brow and my morphe e 29 and I'm

171
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,680
going to begin sketching out my brows

172
00:06:54,740 --> 00:07:01,080
what's your favorite part makeup to do

173
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:03,930
my favorite part is probably um I shadow

174
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:06,450
it's like it's really fun and it's like

175
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:08,610
something new true but I do my face it's

176
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:09,390
always the exact same video so it kind

177
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:11,669
of gets boring

178
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:14,280
um how does this look you drew this

179
00:07:11,669 --> 00:07:15,750
round really really low whereas so that

180
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,250
makes your brow looks tiny which makes

181
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:19,530
them like you're constantly throwing

182
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:23,390
see how this rod is like more arched it

183

184
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:31,200

186
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:38,640
this is this is beauty so you have to

187
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:40,020
hold your head up hold them your down so

188
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,250
you can look in the mirror okay

189

190
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:46,110
in this region your forehead is

192
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:50,400
look at yourself but keep your head up

193
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:52,290
