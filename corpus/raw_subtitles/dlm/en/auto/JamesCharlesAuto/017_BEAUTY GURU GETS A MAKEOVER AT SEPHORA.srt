00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,659
hi sisters James Charles here and

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:05,160
welcome back to my youtube channel first

3
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:06,720
today's that I have something super

4
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,950
super fun plan that I'm actually very

5
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,030
excited to do I don't know if a lot of

6
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,320
you guys know this but before I actually

7
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,389
was the beauty guru it was doing makeup

8
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,710
on myself as a full-time job I actually

9
00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:14,549
was doing makeup on a bunch of my

10
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,379
friends from school

11
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:18,600
back home in my little salon and my

12
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:20,670
basement made by my dad and I really

13
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,470
really missed doing client work so so

14
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,510
much and for me I'm planning to do my

15
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,890
own makeup all the time I really don't

16
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,449
get the feeling or pleasure of being on

17
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,130
the other end of the brush getting my

18
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:30,869
glam done and getting to enjoy the work

19
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,130
of other artists I definitely have a

20
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:34,020
very distinct style of makeup that I

21
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,430
always do it myself I plan a shadows a

22
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,469
certain way I contour my face a certain

23
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,760
way I face to the certain way as well

24
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:39,899
and I was definitely bringing something

25
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,059
about different ways that I can get

26
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:43,649
gland by other people and I came to the

27
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:44,899
conclusion that the perfect way to do it

28
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:47,010
will be to get some awesome

29
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:48,539
transformations so I booked a play with

30
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,829
that the three most popular spots that

31
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:52,530
people go to get their makeup done for

32
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:55,379
different events being Mac Sephora and

33
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,600
Ulta and I went and I got my makeup done

34
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:59,879
at all three and I'm gonna show you guys

35
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,109
default transformation I wanted to make

36
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:02,460
this into a little bit of a challenge or

37
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:03,930
a miniseries so this is gonna be the

38
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,400
first video like I said of a bunch of

39
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,570
different transformation videos for each

40
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,549
different transformation I'm gonna give

41
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:10,500
each artist the same exact photo I

42
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:12,479
picked out this one of Jacqueline Hale I

43
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,920
figured this like warm tone bronzy

44
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,080
smokey eye is the perfect look for this

45
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,520
upcoming fall if features like smoked

46
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,229
out shadow which is definitely not the

47
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,850
easiest technique in the world gold

48
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:22,890
glitter as well as a lot of highlighter

49
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:24,930
definite full coverage skin as well as a

50
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:26,280
dark vampy lip I think that this look is

51
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:27,930
a really great challenge for us because

52
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,549
it's definitely not the easiest thing in

53
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,229
the world but it's definitely not too

54
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:32,640
hard as well I'm gonna give the same

55
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:34,320
exact picture to each artist and they're

56
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,150
gonna do their best job to recreate it

57
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,439
on me using the products sold at that

58
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,880
particular store and after each

59
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,560
registration we're gonna come right back

60
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,240
here and I'm gonna show you guys the

61
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,250
finished look obviously then we're gonna

62
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,649
talk about my experience as a whole how

63
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:47,970
the actual look turned out how close the

64
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:50,280
look was to the original photo and

65
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:52,470
finally what I recommend you to go there

66
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,909
to get your makeup done like I said for

67
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:55,590
today's the first makeover I booked an

68
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:57,360
appointment at Sephora and Hollywood so

69
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,130
let's head over there right now but

70
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,750
before this video starts make sure to go

71
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,070
give it a big thumbs up down below if

72
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,840
you're excited alright guys without

73
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,430
further ado let's hop in an uber and get

74
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,579
over to Sephora

75
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,579
[Music]

76
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:12,340
so immediately walking into somewhere I

77
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:13,540
was created - sales associate which was

78
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,920
really really awesome and she asked me

79
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,960
if I needed anything I told her I was

80
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,250
there to get my glam makeover done that

81
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,350
I was scheduled under a different name

82
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,880
for three o'clock and of course she knew

83
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:23,500
who I was instantly which kind of blew

84
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,150
my cover which I was definitely a little

85
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,040
bit annoyed about I wanted to do this

86
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:28,840
definitely on the DL and incognito but

87
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,300
so many of you sisters kept coming up to

88
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,560
me asking for photos as well which I was

89
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,540
so fine then because I love meeting you

90
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,310
guys anyway you guys blew my cover but

91
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:37,600
it's okay just as the little point

92
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,220
before I get started I think that the

93
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,300
workers knowing who I am definitely may

94
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,410
have made my experience a little bit

95
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,209
better than the average customer

96
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:44,650
obviously I cannot speak for every step

97
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:45,490
for an employer every Sephora store

98
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:47,110
because everyone's gonna have a

99
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:48,459
different experience but and my

100
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:50,500
particular visit they were super super

101
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:52,150
kind and accommodating and my actual

102
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,650
artist didn't know who I was so that was

103
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:55,510
great she treated me as a normal

104
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:57,430
everyday customer which is amazing but

105
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:59,110
that being said at the average Sephora

106
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:01,300
makeover is 45 minutes and I was there

107
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:02,650
for almost two hours so like I said

108
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,940
definitely pobably got a little bit of a

109
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,530
better treatment I can't speak for

110
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:07,090
everybody but my experience overall it

111
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,290
was good to get started on my makeover

112
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:10,180
the absolute first thing I did was show

113
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:11,860
my artist a picture of the look that I

114
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:14,140
wanted being that Jacqueline Hale smokey

115
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,519
eye and she said okay great let's do it

116
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:17,320
so that was awesome she was not

117
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,519
intimidated to is not scared she didn't

118
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,660
try to talk me into something else which

119
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:21,250
was amazing because I know a lot of

120
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,989
times hardest do try to do that to do

121
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,190
something easier I was like girl we're

122
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:25,750
doing this look and she was like okay

123
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:27,010
sister I got you the first thing that

124
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,299
she did was asked me for my skin type

125
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:29,500
and I told her that it was combination

126
00:03:28,299 --> 00:03:31,000
and she pulled a bunch of different skin

127
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,620
care products to prep me for my makeup

128
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,019
and then as well she pulled out the

129
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:36,130
Sephora IQ color tester this is

130
00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:37,840
basically a little machine that takes

131
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:39,880
tiny pictures of different areas of your

132
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,200
skin which then it matches you to your

133
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,519
foundation and difference to four

134
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,130
foundations that they sell in store

135
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:47,650
which i thought was so so cool I think

136
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:49,030
my color IQ thing was like - 7 qy or

137
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:50,440
something I don't remember off the top

138
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,820
of my head but my foundation was

139
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,350
definitely a pretty close match to what

140
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,459
my normal foundation would be so after

141
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,810
my skin was all prepped with a bunch of

142
00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:58,060
different skin care products the first

143
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:59,860
is the artist Reynolds eyelid primer to

144
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,150
start off the eyeshadow base and for

145
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,709
Ashley doe today she used the Sephora

146
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:04,030
Pro palette which I think was the warm

147
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:05,560
palette and then a little bit of the

148
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:07,540
anasazi of blonde renaissance palette

149
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,680
for more touches of red and pink even

150
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,970
though my eyes were closed and I was not

151
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,860
turned towards the mirror I obviously

152
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:13,390
could feel what was going on and I did

153
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,769
notice and really appreciate that she

154
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:16,209
definitely spent a lot of time blending

155
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:17,350
she kept going back into the bunch a

156
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:18,340
different blending brushes making sure

157
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,910
that all of her lines are really

158
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,230
seamlessly

159
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:22,060
but it out which I definitely appreciate

160
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:23,440
as an artist obviously you guys know it

161
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,790
is super super important to always blend

162
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,440
your eyeshadows always go on those

163
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:28,120
circular windshield wiper motions make

164
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,320
sure there are no harsh lines and I

165
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,790
definitely think she did a good job of

166
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,410
achieving pot it's actually giving the

167
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:34,330
eyeshadow look that I gave her to do

168
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:36,010
next the artist went in and did my brows

169
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:37,270
using the Anasazi eyebrow definer and

170
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:39,460
then set all the hairs in place using

171
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:41,410
the Benefit Cosmetics 24-hour brow

172
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:43,060
center once the bronze were all slayed

173
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:44,590
and in place her next step is going to

174
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,630
be deep base and for today's foundation

175
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:48,190
she's the bare minerals performance

176
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:50,020
we're at liquid foundation now as you

177
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:52,540
guys know my holy grail of the Make Up

178
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:54,190
For Ever Ultra HD stick to face Born

179
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:56,500
This Way and recently the Giorgio Armani

180
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:58,450
luminous silk all of which are sold at

181
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,010
Sephora and bare minerals was definitely

182
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:01,930
not to be the first brand that I would

183
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:03,760
run to when it comes to foundation but I

184
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:05,140
do not say anything I was super super

185
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,390
careful to keep my opinions to myself

186
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:09,160
the entire time I did not look at myself

187
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:11,470
either I wanted a full reveal at the end

188
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,880
and it to be the full artist work next

189
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:14,170
for concealers she went in with the NARS

190
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,300
radiant creamy concealer in the shade

191
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:18,580
vanilla I believe and as you guys know a

192
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,930
shave team is now sold at Sephora so I

193
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,430
think the NARS radiant creamy was

194
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:23,050
definitely a really really great option

195
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:24,310
to use on me and is definitely one of my

196
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:25,930
all-time favorite concealers as well

197
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:27,340
then she set my face in place using the

198
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:29,230
laura mercier translucent setting powder

199
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,460
which is my all-time favorite I was

200
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:32,230
definitely really really glad about this

201
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:33,550
because y'all know flash shock is my

202
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:35,290
middle name so I definitely did not want

203
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:36,940
to have a powder that I do not like and

204
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:38,410
I was very very happy to see her using

205
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,300
this one on me and I think it worked I

206
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:41,919
was normal perfectly fine next step she

207
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,540
went in and bronze my face using a big

208
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,790
fluffy brush was obviously I have love

209
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,750
and she ended the hourglass of bronzer

210
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:48,430
which I was simply a little bit

211
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,810
surprised about being that benefit hoola

212
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:51,880
bronzer is the number one best-selling

213
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:53,770
bronzer in Sephora I believe don't quote

214
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,940
me on that but I think regardless it's

215
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,930
my number one favorite so I was

216
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,880
definitely little bit disappointed to

217
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:58,900
see her not using that the hourglass was

218
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,220
definitely an interesting choice they

219
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,810
actually did not even know they even had

220
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:03,790
bronzers I just know about their hominis

221
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:05,290
which are really really bomb so once

222
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:06,730
again do not say anything just let her

223
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:08,050
do her thing then she ran in with the

224
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:09,280
highlight and at this point I definitely

225
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:10,870
could tell she was a fan of beauty gurus

226
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,520
because after I showed her the picture

227
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,690
of Jacqueline Pele in the beginning for

228
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,250
Highlander she pulled out this champagne

229
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:17,230
pop which is Jacqueline's collaboration

230
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:19,150
with Becca cosmetics I was super excited

231
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:20,080
to see this one being used on me it is

232
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:21,310
definitely my all-time favorite

233
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,050
highlighter shades it is beautiful and

234
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:24,340
golden and she prob about using a pretty

235
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,169
big brush which I was a little bit

236
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:28,060
spooked about but once again it didn't

237
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:29,919
get to see until the very very end after

238
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:31,360
I was glowing for the goods she actually

239
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,430
went back into the eyes to finish

240
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,860
the mascara and lashes and for the

241
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:37,030
mascaras to use the Marc Jacobs mascara

242
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:38,710
which I was very excited off because

243
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:40,240
I've never tried it and she actually did

244
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:42,280
something with the wand that I was super

245
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,719
super intrigued by she took the top of

246
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,639
the mascara wand and bend it at a 90

247
00:06:43,719 --> 00:06:46,830
degree angle and used that to do my

248
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:49,210
lashes instead of like the typical

249
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:50,530
completely horizontal wand I thought it

250
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:51,610
was a really really cool technique and

251
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:53,349
definitely made it really really easy

252
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:54,400
for her to do eyelashes this is

253
00:06:53,349 --> 00:06:56,199
definitely saying that I'll be trying

254
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,550
with all eye mascara wands from now on I

255
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:58,750
definitely learned that as a really cool

256
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:00,550
trick and I can't wait to try it out for

257
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:02,169
myself for the lashes TV one on a pair

258
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:03,340
of Sephora lashes I forgot to catch the

259
00:07:02,169 --> 00:07:04,900
name for them but they're really really

260
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,430
pretty and they're more winged out on

261
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:08,110
the outer corners just like in the

262
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:09,610
picture that Jacqueline had finally to

263
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:11,139
finish off the look she's the Kat Von D

264
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:12,729
Vampira liquid lipstick which is

265
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:14,680
actually the first ever liquid lipstick

266
00:07:12,729 --> 00:07:16,029
I ever purchased with my own money when

267
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,199
I first started to do makeup so it

268
00:07:16,029 --> 00:07:18,909
definitely has a very very special place

269
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,050
in my heart she did pick it herself but

270
00:07:18,909 --> 00:07:21,159
I thought it was the absolute perfect

271
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:22,419
shade too back to the picture of

272
00:07:21,159 --> 00:07:23,830
Jacqueline so I was definitely really

273
00:07:22,419 --> 00:07:27,180
happy when she walked over with it and

274
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:27,180
she just put it on my lips

275
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,090
all right guys so now I am back home and

276
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:38,740
this is the finished look all complete

277
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:40,000
justice a little heads-up to you guys I

278
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,919
didn't have the entire portion of this

279
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,050
video filmed as soon as I got home with

280
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,550
the full makeup on and I film the outro

281
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:47,259
with the makeup on as well it was super

282
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:48,970
super cute and then of course I went to

283
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:50,979
edit it and the audio was completely

284
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:52,449
wonky and broken my microphone had

285
00:07:50,979 --> 00:07:54,789
actually died so I had to go get a new

286
00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:56,080
end which was very very annoying but the

287
00:07:54,789 --> 00:07:57,310
make cover was obviously complete and I

288
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,330
already filmed the entire thing and I

289
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,680
definitely did not want to lose this

290
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:01,720
video because I was super excited to do

291
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,490
the rest of the series so I am sitting

292
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,930
back down after the fact I obviously do

293
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:06,909
not have the makeup on anymore

294
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:08,199
but I am referencing the pictures from

295
00:08:06,909 --> 00:08:09,099
earlier on and I'm still gonna talk

296
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:10,479
about how I felt

297
00:08:09,099 --> 00:08:11,470
so obviously the audio is not gonna

298
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,610
match up with what's going on in the

299
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,780
video but just please sort of pay

300
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:15,580
attention to what I am saying and just

301
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:17,139
use the video as like a reference point

302
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,250
to what I'm really talking about before

303
00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:19,569
we get into the actual makeup my first

304
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,949
want to talk about my experience at this

305
00:08:19,569 --> 00:08:23,680
particular Sephora and like I said

306
00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:24,819
beforehand it was really really good now

307
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,259
obviously I cannot speak for every

308
00:08:24,819 --> 00:08:27,789
Sephora employee or store and I

309
00:08:26,259 --> 00:08:29,259
definitely do have a name in the makeup

310
00:08:27,789 --> 00:08:31,180
world so the treatment may have been a

311
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:32,860
little bit biased but I've also been

312
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:34,240
very very poorly treated and a lot of

313
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:36,279
supports that I've been to as well

314
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,479
so I do think this particular support

315
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:39,039
did a really really great job of

316
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:40,329
customer service like I said when I

317
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,740
walked and they were very very helpful

318
00:08:40,329 --> 00:08:43,209
they wanted to get me help as soon as

319
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:44,350
possible to give me what I needed and

320
00:08:43,209 --> 00:08:46,300
they stopped me right down for my

321
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:48,220
appointment my girl was on time and she

322
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,630
was ready to slay my face all that being

323
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:51,430
said a Sephora makeover it's supposed to

324
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:53,920
take only 45 minutes and mine did take

325
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:55,180
almost up to 2 hours but there was not

326
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,260
many other people in the store getting

327
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:58,149
their makeup done so that might be a

328
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:59,470
reason why and also I'm sure that the

329
00:08:58,149 --> 00:09:00,970
artist was making sure that she did a

330
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:03,010
really really great job which I very

331
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:04,300
much appreciated let's go ahead and pull

332
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:06,430
a mirror and super super close and

333
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,720
actually talk about the makeup so let's

334
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:09,970
go in with the same order that she

335
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,470
applied and starting off with the eyes

336
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:12,820
I think after looking at everything the

337
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:14,620
eyes are probably my favorite part of

338
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,880
this entire look like I said beforehand

339
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,380
she definitely spend a lot of time on

340
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,300
the eyeshadow probably the most time out

341
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:20,320
of anything in this makeup book and she

342
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,250
kept going back into the different

343
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,450
blending brushes to make sure that

344
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:24,100
everything was seamlessly blended

345
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:25,660
together which I'm very much appreciated

346
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,010
and I think that the shadow is pretty

347
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:29,079
accurate to the original picture that

348
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:30,790
Jacqueline Hale posted also the liner is

349
00:09:29,079 --> 00:09:32,290
applying a very very evenly the line is

350
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:34,180
nice and straight and even throughout

351
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:36,160
which I love there's nothing worse than

352
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:38,200
a wonky liner and the lashes are glued

353
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,149
on very very comfortably I cannot figure

354
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,990
them which is the best if there's one

355
00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:42,730
thing that I would change about this

356
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:43,839
look if I was doing it on myself I wish

357
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:45,560
he would have used a different shade of

358
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,880
gold for the actual lid

359
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,260
I feel like the shade that jackal news

360
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,700
on her original picture was a lot more

361
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:51,470
glittery and much more shade painting

362
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,580
toned whereas this gold shadow was

363
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:54,890
definitely little bit more yellow and

364
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:55,910
more a satin shade I wish you would have

365
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:57,590
used one like this tea light liquid

366
00:09:55,910 --> 00:10:00,140
metals like you guys know I love or an

367
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:01,220
actual gold glitter on top but she did

368
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,660
just use the palette and I think it

369
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:04,070
still turned out equally as beautiful

370
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,690
the next stop being the brows I actually

371
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:07,610
really liked the way she did them they

372
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:10,400
looked nice and light and fluffy which I

373
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:11,960
love a good feather brow moment I like

374
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,670
the color she used in the Anasazi abroad

375
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,990
to find her if anything I wish you would

376
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:16,700
have defined the brow tail a little bit

377
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:17,990
more but I'm definitely not mad at them

378
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,640
the next that was obviously going to be

379
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:21,380
the base which was the foundation and

380
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,610
like I said the bare minerals foundation

381
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:24,440
would definitely not be my first choice

382
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:26,360
when it comes to a Sephora foundation

383
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,550
picking but like I said it wasn't gonna

384
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,830
say anything after looking at it in the

385
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:32,120
mirror I don't think it's that bad I

386
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,680
think that she definitely did a really

387
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,089
really great job of using the foundation

388
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,470
to its fullest potential

389
00:10:35,089 --> 00:10:38,089
she did a really great job making sure

390
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:39,650
that it was even all throughout my skin

391
00:10:38,089 --> 00:10:41,240
I definitely don't see any patchiness or

392
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:42,290
anything but I will say that it

393
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,970
definitely is creating a little bit

394
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:45,529
especially around my smile lines like

395
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:47,510
foundations normally do but this one is

396
00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:49,580
pretty bad and as well it's definitely

397
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:51,200
not the most flattering on my pores I

398
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:52,250
don't think she did a bad job but I

399
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,110
definitely would not be choosing this

400
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:55,339
foundation again next is the concealer

401
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:57,140
and like I said we use the NARS radiant

402
00:10:55,339 --> 00:10:58,730
creamy concealer and this is one of my

403
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,960
all-time favorites I have no complaining

404
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:01,550
to this I really liked how it made my

405
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:03,200
under eyes look and feel

406
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:04,400
next was bronzing and contouring and I

407
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,110
think that this is probably my least

408
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,850
favorite part of this look like I said

409
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:09,140
she use the hourglass bronzer and I feel

410
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:10,970
that this bronzer is just a little bit

411
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:12,080
too orange for my skin tone in the

412
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,250
picture that Jacqueline posted she

413
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,290
definitely doesn't have actually too

414
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:16,820
much of a defined contour going on it's

415
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:18,350
definitely a lot softer and I felt as

416
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:20,089
though the bronze and contour today was

417
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:22,160
definitely really really pigmented what

418
00:11:20,089 --> 00:11:23,570
I normally do love but it didn't really

419
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,860
match that one with the photo and I felt

420
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:27,020
as though the bronzer she uses a little

421
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:28,250
bit to oranjee tones I wish it was

422
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,690
definitely a little bit more cool to him

423
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,970
to kind of sculpt the face rather than

424
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:33,589
just bronze and as well she did not

425
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:34,760
contour I know it's which I was really

426
00:11:33,589 --> 00:11:36,380
really spooked about once I looked in

427
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,850
the mirror you guys know that my nose is

428
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:39,830
probably my biggest insecurity and I

429
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:41,390
really love to make it nice and snatched

430
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:43,190
so to see no contour on it was

431
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:44,810
definitely a little bit spooky I should

432
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:45,920
the highlight major props of this artist

433
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:47,240
for knowing different people in the

434
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,890
makeup industry and knowing about Beauty

435
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,270
influence or collapse I thought it was

436
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:51,380
so clever when she pulled out champagne

437
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:52,910
pop after showing a picture with

438
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:54,500
chocolate and like I said it is a

439
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:55,640
beautiful highlighter shade but how

440
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,230
there is applied in all the right places

441
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,830
being the brow bone the inner corner of

442
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:59,510
the tip of the

443
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:00,770
and on the cheekbones but it's

444
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:02,180
definitely a little bit of a subtle glow

445
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:03,230
there's absolutely nothing wrong with

446
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:05,180
that and it is definitely a really

447
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:06,500
really beautiful look on my skintone but

448
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:08,060
I do wish she would have applied a

449
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,740
little bit more with Ash's personal

450
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,090
preference laughs it finally not least

451
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:12,770
we finished off the look with the

452
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:13,910
ellipse and like I said we used the Kat

453
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:16,130
Von D liquid lipstick in the shade

454
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:17,270
Vampira after the actual shape of the

455
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:18,140
lips I think she did a really really

456
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:20,240
good job

457
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:21,380
my lips are actually uneven and one side

458
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,610
is a little bit bigger so I thought she

459
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:24,380
did a really really great job of making

460
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:26,210
sure that the two sides were even and

461
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:28,580
the lines were very very defined which I

462
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:30,260
love I cannot stand a blurry and messy

463
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:31,460
lip line even though the actual shape

464
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,720
was great the one thing I did notice

465
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,470
about the lips is that the product was a

466
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,850
little bit streaky

467
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:36,140
I really wished it would have applied a

468
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:38,030
little bit more product to make the

469
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:40,190
color a lot more even on throughout but

470
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:41,540
it really was not that big of a deal

471
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:44,240
overall I think I would rate this

472
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:45,260
makeover a 7 out of 10 my experience was

473
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,880
really really great and all the

474
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:48,320
employees were so beyond nice to me and

475
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,610
my artist was really really careful to

476
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,530
make sure that I got exactly what I

477
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:52,610
wanted she took a lot of time blending

478
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:53,750
everything and making sure that

479
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:56,030
everything was really really perfect

480
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:57,260
which I really really appreciate it it's

481
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:58,790
super important you have an artist that

482
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:00,590
really cares about you and your vision

483
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:02,060
as a client and isn't just gonna get it

484
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:04,550
done just to get it done and to get that

485
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:05,780
paycheck so major respect to her overall

486
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:07,130
I really liked a lot of different things

487
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:08,120
that she did with my makeups today and

488
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:09,380
definitely picked up on a few new

489
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,000
techniques that I definitely try

490
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,990
obviously there are a few things that I

491
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,970
would have changed if I were doing it

492
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:15,290
myself but every artist has her

493
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:17,030
particular way of doing things and I

494
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:18,740
don't think that the cons outweigh the

495
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:20,210
pros in this situation and I would feel

496
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:22,250
confident enough to wear this makeup out

497
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:23,570
and not like second-guess myself

498
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:25,220
all right guys that is all I have for

499
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:26,420
