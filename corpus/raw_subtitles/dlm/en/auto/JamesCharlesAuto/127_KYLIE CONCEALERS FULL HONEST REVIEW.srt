released a ton of brand-new products to

00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,930
not only did she released two eyeshadow

10
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,660
palettes but she also sent the beauty

11
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:23,760
world into flames and she announced her

12
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:25,170
$360 luxury brush set I just interview

but she also launched a full line of

17
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,469
concealers just like always that ever

18
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,210
Kylie's name was attached there has been

19
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:38,309
a ton of controversy on these babies

20
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,350
right up in here so I got my hands on

21
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:41,489
the full line of all 30 concealers and

22
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,770
today we're gonna put them to the test

23
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:45,539
you guys know that I am a loyal Stan of

24
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,860
the tape tape concealer I love this and

25
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:49,140
I use this all the time and almost every

26
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,460
single look but not even gonna lie I am

27
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,750
getting a little bit bored of having the

28
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,489
same exact makeup routine at every

29
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,360
single time I have another point right

30
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:55,770
now where I just want to be more

31
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,360
creative and try out new products so who

32
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,820
knows maybe this concealers will be

33
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,109
amazing but we're about to find out just

34
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,280
to clarify as usual when it comes to

35
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:03,989
reviews because you guys know some

36
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,790
people are crazy in that comment section

37
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:06,840
this video is not sponsored I am NOT

38
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,880
being paid to say anything

39
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,010
I love Kylie but I'm not on her BR list

40
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,780
so this is completely unbiased even

41
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,670
playing field these might be amazing it

42
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,689
these might suck we're gonna find out

43
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,250
together

44
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:18,880
we're laut further ado let's go ahead

45
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:22,030
and jump into the review

46
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,030
[Music]

47
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:25,770
so before we actually go into the our

48
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,750
makeup routine today let's go ahead and

49
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,620
talk about the actual product itself so

50
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,330
the day that I'm filming this is

51
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,500
December 13 I'm not exactly sure when

52
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:34,350
this video it's gonna go but it should

53
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,180
be up relatively soon after that but the

54
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:37,770
skin concealers launched today on Kylie

55
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,510
cosmetics and she says they are

56
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:42,420
lightweight and designed to give a

57
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:44,010
flawless skin line finish contrary to

58
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,810
Kylie's absolutely ridiculous price tag

59
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:47,910
on her breasts at these consumers will

60
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,170
be retailing for $20 each on her website

61
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:50,640
when these lunch which I actually feel

62
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:52,680
is a very very fair price

63
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,850
looking at Sephora I'm looking at other

64
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,160
concealer prices like the NARS radiant

65
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:58,530
creamy concealer I think it's $30 Urban

66
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:01,880
Decay Naked skin I think is 29 the NARS

67
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:05,190
soft concealer is 30 Kat Von D is 26

68
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:08,790
makeup forever is 34 and cosmetics is 24

69
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:10,710
and I believe shape tape is 28 to find

70
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:11,970
correct so this is definitely honestly

71
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:13,470
on the lower end of some of the

72
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:14,940
concealer price tags this is the

73
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,380
component it comes in and based on the

74
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:19,290
bottom of the package it comes with a

75
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:21,180
point 22 fluid ounces of product in

76
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:23,670
comparison to shape tape my shape tape

77
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,080
has point 33 fluid ounces of products so

78
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:27,060
you get a little bit more in this and

79
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:30,510
then the very popular color pop no

80
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:32,130
filter concealer comes with only point

81
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:34,050
14 fluid ounces so this is probably a

82
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,670
middle of the line when it comes to

83
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,320
actual amount of product that you're

84
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:38,520
given moving on let's go ahead and talk

85
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,020
about the shade range because that has

86
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,489
also been a very very controversial

87
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,320
subject of this launch

88
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:44,670
so Kylie's concealers launched with 30

89
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,170
different shades starting with the shade

90
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,820
of pearl in the top left with the

91
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:49,830
lightest shade and the bottom right

92
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:51,360
shade being a cocoa which is the darkest

93
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,470
looking at the contrast between the

94
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,390
lightest shade and the darkest shade

95
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:56,580
together I think that this contrast is

96
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:58,050
honestly very very impressive there's

97
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,370
obviously a huge lack of diversity and

98
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:00,810
the makeup industry and I really wish

99
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:02,400
brands was hard to recognize more people

100
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,660
of color bloggers there are so many

101
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,220
beautiful and talented ones out there

102
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:07,110
that deserve equally as much cosmetic

103
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,340
recognition I really wish it wasn't the

104
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,989
case for a shade this dark is like

105
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,760
something to applaud over but like I

106
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:13,500
said the laka diversity and the beauty

107
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,360
industry has caused it to be so honestly

108
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,739
good job sister Kylie for doing this

109
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,880
obviously a few months ago Rihanna

110
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:19,470
chopped her fmt beauty line which

111
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,209
literally had the entire nation shook

112
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:22,920
she had 40 different colors in her

113
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:24,510
foundation which i think was so so

114
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,739
incredible and honestly I think she set

115
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:27,300
the standard for future launches

116
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:28,740
literally every time I go into Sephora

117
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,750
at this point most of the middle section

118
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:32,490
and literally the entire darker section

119
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,490
of the Fanta Beauty line is always sold

120
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:35,620
out what you think is so

121
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:37,000
so great but a lot of people are

122
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,890
comparing this launch of Kylie's

123
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,390
concealers to Fenty beauty's foundation

124
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:42,070
having darker foundation chains has

125
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:43,660
always been a major issue for a lot of

126
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:45,040
huge beauty brands and I think fenty

127
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,930
vidi has now really changed the game

128
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,550
when it comes to shade range a lot of

129
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:49,690
people are very very angry with kylie

130
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:51,640
and a lot of people are saying that

131
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:53,080
she's just copying rihanna and my

132
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,490
opinion it feels a little bit weird to

133
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,200
fight in favor of a really really large

134
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:57,700
shade range which is really really great

135
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,990
but that have Kylie come out with her 30

136
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,280
different shades and then turn around

137
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:01,780
and say that she's doing it wrong and

138
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,100
get angry with her forehead I don't know

139
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,570
though I am definitely not at a place to

140
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:06,220
be showing my opinions about this and I

141
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:07,240
don't want to speak over anybody so I'm

142
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,010
definitely looking forward to watching

143
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,270
hopefully Jackie I know Alyssa Ashley

144
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:11,710
unnie Batangas video about these

145
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:13,360
concealers because I really want to hear

146
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,650
what they have to say quickly before we

147
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,300
begin I want to swatch for you guys the

148
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:18,070
lightest and darkest shades just to show

149
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,330
the contrast first we have the lightest

150
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:21,070
shade of Kylie's concealer which is the

151
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:23,530
shade pearl then we have the latest

152
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:25,540
shade of shape tape which is fair and

153
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:27,610
then finally we have color pops latest

154
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:29,650
shade which is in the shade a fair five

155
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:30,850
out of the three of these Kylie's of the

156
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:32,290
lightest and then we have the darker

157
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:34,240
shades and just to clarify these

158
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:35,980
swatches are not to help anybody find

159
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,960
the right color this is simply just to

160
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:40,330
show contrast first we have Kylie's

161
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,890
darkest shade which is called cocoa then

162
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:44,050
we have a Tarte shape tape which is in

163
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:46,330
the shade mahogany and then finally we

164
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:48,610
have color pop in the shade of wrench 75

165
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:51,010
your cars out of all these once again it

166
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:52,540
Kylie's is the darkest whoa that took a

167
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:54,010
very very long time and now that we have

168
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,930
all the logistics out of the way and you

169
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:57,550
guys know all the details let's go ahead

170
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:58,950
and actually put this concealer to the

171
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:01,030
test

172
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:02,230
originally on her snapchat she said that

173
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:04,390
they were definitely lightweight and

174
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:06,220
buildable for a very very natural type

175
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:07,630
look so that's exactly what I'm gonna do

176
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:09,610
today I am gonna be filming it a little

177
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:11,470
bit with a very very fun friend so I do

178
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:13,450
want to do a kind of more like glam look

179
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:14,830
as opposed to something super intense so

180
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:17,350
I'm just starting off by priming my skin

181
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:20,920
using the Mac stroke cream in the shade

182
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:22,600
like the gold one just for very very do

183
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,950
we look for foundation I'm using my Too

184
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,870
Faced Born This Way Foundation in the

185
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:27,580
shade nude and I'm gonna doing just a

186
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:29,320
light layer of this I'm not gonna go

187
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,730
full intense coverage like I normally do

188
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,930
so I brought up my Tarte shave deep in

189
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,250
the shade light which is one that I

190
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,930
always use to my everyday makeup routine

191
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,950
and by looking at the collection I

192
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,550
determined that my best shade is

193
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:38,530
probably gonna be

194
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:39,680
gypsum I'm just going to go into this

195
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:42,410
concealer in place and

196
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,780
my normal location starting off under my

197
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:46,280
eyes I'm also gonna pull this down my

198
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:47,900
nose bridge as always because you guys

199
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,850
know that I like to it snatch the nose

200
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,990
in comparison to say page just because I

201
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,580
know that that's what I use in a lot of

202
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:54,800
you guys use as well it is definitely a

203
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:57,020
lot more light weight when I put it on

204
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,639
it doesn't feel so like clunky but

205
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:00,139
hopefully that doesn't mean that the

206
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,320
coverage won't be as good let's go ahead

207
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:05,900
and blend in oh wow

208
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:10,759
okay actually blends out really really

209
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:12,530
easily damn okay Kylie did not come to

210
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:14,150
play I don't know if you guys can really

211
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:15,560
tell on camera with all these lights but

212
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:18,349
obviously you guys know that I talk with

213
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,580
a lot of expression in my face and I

214
00:06:18,349 --> 00:06:22,310
just raised my eyebrows a little bit to

215
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:24,440
set underneath my eyes and now I have

216
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:25,820
really really bad creases so hopefully

217
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,110
this consider doesn't get too crazy and

218
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,430
when I set it with powder it'll fix

219
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:30,050
itself I'm gonna grab a lighter

220
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:31,190
concealer in the shade stole from the

221
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:33,199
collection and I'm just gonna put this

222
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:34,639
right in the inner corners underneath my

223
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,259
eyes just to try to build up the

224
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,910
coverage a little bit and brighten

225
00:06:36,259 --> 00:06:40,370
because I feel like the lash eight I use

226
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:42,349
which was gypsum was a little bit too

227
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:43,970
close to my natural skin tone not even

228
00:06:42,349 --> 00:06:45,710
being dramatic this actually blends out

229
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:47,810
like a dream like this is going on very

230
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:49,639
very smoothly it's not picking up any of

231
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:51,320
the foundation underneath and definitely

232
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:53,240
it's like pretty decent coverage too I

233
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,470
know it says light carpet on it but I

234
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,180
actually feel like this might be more of

235
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:57,830
a medium coverage and if it is light

236
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:59,510
it's definitely buildable because as you

237
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:00,650
guys saw when they out of that second

238
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:02,630
layer it definitely added a lot more

239
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:05,090
pigment and my under eye bags are like

240
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:06,699
literally gone and I got I think three

241
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:08,780
hours of sleep last night so this is

242
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:10,009
kind of a pressed that before we start

243
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:12,530
cruising all over I'm just going to

244
00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:13,639
blend out below my eyes and then grab my

245
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:16,190
translucent powder and my Beauty Blender

246
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:18,889
and just underneath there to make sure

247
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:22,520
it is in place I'm also gonna pack this

248
00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:24,620
on my nose set up the forehead to make

249
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,240
sure I don't get any crusty wrinkles and

250
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,889
then just using access to go over thrust

251
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,180
my face not going in too intense because

252
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:31,430
I do want it to be kind of doing today

253
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:32,810
and not too matte but obviously we want

254
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:34,039
our makeup to say on looking in the

255
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:35,690
mirror I absolutely love how this works

256
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:37,729
so far I was able to layer up the cover

257
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:39,740
so it looks super super nice my under

258
00:07:37,729 --> 00:07:42,530
eye bags are literally gone honestly it

259
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:43,789
looks really belief flawless I'm so

260
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:44,930
pleasantly surprised

261
00:07:43,789 --> 00:07:47,030
I didn't think they're gonna be bad but

262
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:48,710
I was not ready for this shape tape

263
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:50,180
maybe quaking by the end of this video

264
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:52,510
but obviously we have a lot more to go

265
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,620
but the one thing that I will say

266
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:55,510
and with the amount of light going on

267
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,410
and skin Swilly filters there is no way

268
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:58,330
that you're gonna be able see this on

269
00:07:56,410 --> 00:08:00,100
camera but it is here you're just kind

270
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:02,440
of trust me on this one I promise if you

271
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:04,420
are a fellow glasses wearer like me you

272
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,860
know those red circles that we get right

273
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:07,000
up in here on the nose bridge from other

274
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,100
classes sound your nose there's

275
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,290
literally like permanently embedded into

276
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:12,910
my face I can kind of see the circles

277
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:14,500
peeking through on both sides the

278
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:16,120
concealer does not cover them fully but

279
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,500
then again this does not claim to be a

280
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,730
full coverage concealer so it's

281
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,290
definitely not a deal-breaker

282
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:21,640
all right guys the other my face is all

283
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:22,690
set in place and ready to go I'm gonna

284
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,670
go ahead and finish them off my makeup

285
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:25,930
routine and then I'll be right back to

286
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,220
do a little check it and then I'm gonna

287
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:29,080
wear this for a few hours and we're

288
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:31,060
gonna put it to the test it looks really

289
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,680
great right now but who knows and a few

290
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:34,450
hours that may be creepy and gross and

291
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,040
completely worn off we're gonna have to

292
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:37,419
find out alright scissors it has been

293
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,919
about one hour now and I just finished

294
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:40,570
out my makeup like I said I was gonna go

295
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:42,400
for this light everyday look I added

296
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:44,710
some fake freckles and no lashes and

297
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,730
just nice and it's later growls I love

298
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:47,590
how this book turned out I feel

299
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:49,090
absolutely stunning but the point of

300
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:50,590
this video is not this look it is the

301
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:51,760
concealer like I said it has only been

302
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:53,800
one hour now but it still looks really

303
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,970
really bomb I did cover up my cheek

304
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,500
region obviously with freckles but you

305
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:58,780
can still tell under the eyes right here

306
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,520
it still looks very very bright it isn't

307
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:02,290
actually creasing either which is really

308
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,400
really great my forehead looks fine and

309
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:05,230
my moustache region looks fine and

310
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,090
there's no creases everything looks

311
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:09,280
really really good and I'm honestly

312
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:10,360
extremely impressed I have to have out

313
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,980
to see a few different rents right now

314
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,060
but I'm gonna take you guys along with

315
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:15,280
me and we're going to do some check-ins

316
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:17,350
every few hours to see if this concealer

317
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:19,270
stays in place all night long

318
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:20,740
okay sisters we are doing a talk to

319
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:25,210
check in and what better person to do

320
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:26,950
Otaki check in then so I'm wearing a new

321
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:28,270
product on my face right now I would

322
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:29,920
love for you to tell me what you think

323
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:31,960
about my skin right now okay the

324
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,060
foundation looks really nice I like the

325
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:36,070
highlight I like the whole like brow

326
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:39,160
highlight inner corner moment you have

327
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:41,620
going on I dig that the freckle area did

328
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:43,240
you make it darker yeah I did I put some

329
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:45,910
bronzer on and some blush on to like

330
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,860
okay to make it look like youthful like

331
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:49,780
I was sunkissed but thinking more

332
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:52,530
specifically about like complex it's a

333
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:56,260
contested the Kylie concealers of course

334
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:59,470
this is like the hot product shocker

335
00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:01,660
I've seen better okay I don't know it

336
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:04,480
looks a little powdery were you ladies

337
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:06,370
loving it I honestly was I was a little

338
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,900
bit shocked because I didn't I didn't

339
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:09,910
think they're gonna be bad but I wasn't

340
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:12,700
expecting much and I was actually really

341
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:15,100
pleasantly surprised and looking at them

342
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:16,000
compared to what they look like an hour

343
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:18,910
ago I feel like they still look exactly

344
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,440
the same just an hour mm-hmm your under

345
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:22,810
eyes don't look bad I think the thing

346
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,610
that I'm noticing is the Sunkist thing

347
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:27,450
you did is throwing off a little bit of

348
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:29,440
the brightness well I feel like I met I

349
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:32,890
felt like after I do that I was like oh

350
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,900
maybe not the best example for handle is

351
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:36,280
it full coverage or just like it's light

352
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,290
coverage but I felt like when I put it

353
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,880
on it was more medium coverage which I

354
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:41,770
definitely was not upset about and then

355
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:43,930
I was able to layer actually really well

356
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:47,350
so it is buildable for sure I mean I

357
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:49,210
want to show lack my face life rocks I

358
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:51,280
process are taught to the entire light

359
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:53,050
range of the concealers this is pretty

360
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:55,570
full coverage yeah I feel like this is

361
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:57,250
this is actually really nice I agree I'm

362
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:59,170
not breaking the rules you never really

363
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:01,480
want to put concealer on top of powder

364
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:03,250
but I'm just gonna see what happens I've

365
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,200
been wearing this makeup all day long

366
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:07,060
that's actually the way to do it if you

367
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,530
really really need a touch-up with your

368
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:10,270
concealer like put it on the back of

369
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:13,120
your hand with a sponge and then you can

370
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:16,350
kind of just get the tiniest amount I've

371
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,350
never done that before but I'm horrified

372
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:21,940
really just kind of like touched up the

373
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:24,190
situation I like it I do too

374
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:25,450
I was like and it's only 20 dollars to

375
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:27,100
it which I feel like is honestly it's

376
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:31,750
way deeper than it's change it's not

377
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:33,250
it's not 360 it's not I I think it's

378
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,180
good but obviously I need to keep

379
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:36,040
writing this if they're out tonight and

380
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:37,540
I will keep you guys posted it's been

381
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,310
two hours now I think it still is going

382
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:42,520
up pretty strong under eyes may look a

383
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:44,230
little bit dry but that's just good I'll

384
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,940
keep you guys posted alright sister I

385
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:47,050
just got back home from it very very fun

386
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:48,420
night out with friends and it's

387
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:51,040
currently

388
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:52,450
11:37 p.m. at night

389
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,730
this means this makeup has been on for

390
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:57,580
just over eight hours now I definitely

391
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:59,830
am really ready to take this off and go

392
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:02,050
to bed but let's do our final check-in

393
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:03,430
and final thoughts so this is Kelly I

394
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:05,950
face after eight hours of wearing with

395
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:07,120
absolutely no touch-ups I mean we can

396
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:07,820
tell it's getting a little bit crust to

397
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,350
get this point I'm definitely

398
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:11,360
getting some creases around this area

399
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:13,730
I'm definitely looking a little bit oily

400
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,080
as well but honestly I don't hate it you

401
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:16,970
guys know that I've honestly been loving

402
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:19,070
it the more natural dewy skin rips loose

403
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:21,290
on kind of living for this like lift and

404
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:23,090
makeup look but let's discuss the actual

405
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:24,260
concealer and like the under-eye region

406
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:26,000
looking in the mirror like I said my

407
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:28,580
face is a little bit do get oily right

408
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,050
now which I kind of like but if I touch

409
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:31,490
like right here or in the side of my

410
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:33,500
forehead it definitely feels a little

411
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:36,290
bit oily but if I touch underneath my

412
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:38,690
eyes it is literally bone-dry or like

413
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:39,740
I'm talking Sahara Desert level you guys

414
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:41,390
saw that when I asked how do you a my

415
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:43,310
under eyes she did did if they looked a

416
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:44,510
little bit dry to me personally

417
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:47,210
obviously I see myself with makeup on

418
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:48,530
every single day I do not see that this

419
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:49,820
might be a little bit weird to say and

420
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:51,920
definitely may comment down below if you

421
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:53,780
think otherwise but I actually feel like

422
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,580
my under eyes look a little bit better

423
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:57,830
than normal I feel like the brightness

424
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:59,120
is still very much there like you can

425
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:00,890
not see my under-eye bags

426
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,270
peeking through at all and I feel like

427
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:04,220
the crease such level on them is a

428
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:05,600
little bit less than normal as well

429
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:07,400
aside from the aesthetic self on a

430
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,650
feeling level my under eyes do feel

431
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,520
ridiculously dry I feel like 20 dollars

432
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:11,900
for the amount of product you're getting

433
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:14,120
is actually a really really fair price

434
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:16,130
especially in comparison to some of the

435
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,630
other high-end more popular concealers

436
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:19,190
on the market right now on Kylie's

437
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,780
Instagram she said that this was a light

438
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:22,190
coverage but buildable concealer and I

439
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:23,690
would agree with her on that and

440
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:25,190
definitely went on a pretty light but I

441
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:26,570
was able to layer over top of it for a

442
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:28,340
more full coverage and brightening

443
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:29,930
effect and I actually really really love

444
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:31,790
how this looked on my under eyes and on

445
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:32,930
the rest of my face today I will say

446
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:35,150
though that this formula is pretty

447
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:36,350
drying it looked absolutely beautiful on

448
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:38,300
my skin before I said it with a lot of

449
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:40,430
powder but you guys know sister James

450
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:42,170
needs a whole lot of powder I do have a

451
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:44,120
combination to oily skin so I think that

452
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:45,080
if you have my skin type this will be

453
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,430
really really perfect for you because

454
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,320
it'll dry down a little bit and just

455
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:49,880
sent really beautifully into place but I

456
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,290
think that if you have dry skin this may

457
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,330
be a no-go because it might look a

458
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:54,740
little bit crusty and dusty just like my

459
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:56,480
under eyes were a little bit close to

460
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:58,040
getting today I think that the one major

461
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,090
flaw with us that may defer you from

462
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,920
getting to concealer as the fact that

463
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:02,180
Kylie is an e-commerce brand

464
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,380
I know Kylie has been doing her little

465
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,850
Kylie truck thing that like goes around

466
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:06,080
all different stops in LA and love

467
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:07,130
people try out different products what

468
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,480
you think is really really great

469
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,680
obviously she does not have any stores

470
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,360
where you can actually test the products

471
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,620
and and what I find really really great

472
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,600
about these concealers is that Kylie

473
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:16,460
doesn't do returns so if you order a

474
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,950
shade it's a completely wrong shade

475
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:20,510
you're stuck with it and you have 20

476
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:21,740
on the train if this is a product that

477
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:22,640
you want to check out I would definitely

478
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:24,110
recommend it doing your research

479
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,460
especially when it comes to your shade

480
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:27,020
range I would very much recommend

481
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:28,220
finding another beauty blogger or

482
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:30,500
influencer who has purchased that

483
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:31,970
concealers or receive them NPR that has

484
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,500
a similar skin tone to you and trying to

485
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:35,510
figure out what shade really works so

486
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,560
you can make an educated decision just

487
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:38,120
our reference for those of you guys out

488
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,230
there who are close to my skin tone my

489
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,670
two favorite foundations are my Too

490
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:42,290
Faced Born This Way in the shade a nude

491
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:44,750
and eye makeup forever stick in the

492
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:46,010
shade why 315 and I usually like my

493
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,840
concealer to be one or two shades

494
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:49,490
lighter so in shape tape I'm in the

495
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:51,470
shade of light and therefore in the

496
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:53,420
Kylie concealer I am in the shade gypsum

497
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:54,980
overall after testing out this concealer

498
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:57,260
and my makeup routine and wearing it for

499
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:58,910
eight hours straight I think that Kylie

500
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:00,560
has a winner on her hands

501
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:01,850
alright says it is literally getting so

502
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,770
