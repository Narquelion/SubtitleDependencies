00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,449
this kid makes fun of me all the time

163
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,889
and I finally stood up for myself and

164
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:42,569
they front of him back then I got

165
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:44,699

[ __ ] so I literally it went home and of

169
00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:53,610
course like might well itself literally

170
00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:54,959
just hopped on Twitter and started

171
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:56,669
tweeting about it and I was like this

172
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:58,439
then he literally called Mia again in

173
00:06:56,669 --> 00:06:59,879
the next day I was like I thought you

174
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:02,579
have some few choice words to say on

175
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:04,110
Twitter and I had literal printouts like

176
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:05,580
all my tweets on printer hey

177
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:07,259

playing this game today I know your ass

179
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:10,889

180
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:12,750
that I got punched I set up for myself

181
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:14,990
it is so important to not victim blame

182
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:17,400
and then I walked out of his office

183
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:18,389
garbage I guess it was really kind of

184
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,219
like getting a tool but that was the

185
