00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:46,590

30
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:06,829
started

31
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:06,829
[Music]

32
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:10,580
I'm gonna stalk my bubble States today

33
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:12,260
by moisturizing her skin using the top

34
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:14,090
water cream if you guys have my makeup

35
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:16,130
tips and tricks today from a few weeks

36
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:17,990
ago I talked about the importance of

37
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:20,000
using a moisturizer before at your

38
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:21,440
makeup routine my mom does have more

39
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,729
mature skin but we are obviously gonna

40
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,930
be putting on a whole lotta makeups

41
00:01:22,729 --> 00:01:25,340
today so we really want to make sure

42
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:27,500
that all the makeup goes on nice and

43
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:28,970
smoothly and does it look like cakey and

44
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,590
textured because that's never the goal

45
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:31,670
for Friday's you say I'm gonna go into

46
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,990
the Too Faced Born This Way Foundation

47
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:34,729
you guys know this is my all-time

48
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:36,590
favorite and my mom does have a holy

49
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:38,180
skin it like me as well so this will

50
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:39,950
work really really well with her skin

51
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,420
type and like we were saying she does

52
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:42,680
have more mature skin so this is gonna

53
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:45,500
be a full coverage foundation which I

54
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:47,270
would normally not do but sister

55
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,700
Christie does love a really good a full

56
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:51,800
coverage base right yes and that is

57
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:55,970
because she has it oh sorry

58
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:57,020
did a lot yeah well don't tell the

59
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:58,520
sisters a little bit more about what

60
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:01,460
vitiligo is and how it is kind of like

61
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:04,640
affected you vitiligo is an autoimmune

62
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:06,800
disease and there isn't any cure doesn't

63
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,520
hurt and it's not contagious but it is

64
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:12,709
waste spots that continue to increase as

65
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:16,810
years go on but I've learned to embrace

66
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:19,640
my spots and love my skin no matter what

67
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:21,830

72
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:36,230

00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:54,049
a child and all sorts of fun and

82
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,120
embarrassing things so let's do that

83
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:57,739
I guess scissored you and asks do you

84
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,690
think James is more like his mom or his

85
00:02:57,739 --> 00:03:01,940
dad and in what ways do you think he is

86
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:05,480
like you James has a very strong

87
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:06,610
personality he always has his dad has a

88
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:11,920
strong person

89
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:14,180
okay so I like you you're kind sometimes

90
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,310
excuse me I remember when you were

91
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:18,200
younger you'd go to school and the

92
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:20,300
teachers thought you were the best thing

93
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:23,300
since sliced bread and I'm like are you

94
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:25,460
talking about the same James because you

95
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,510
always gave us a run for our money when

96
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:29,960
you were younger

97
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:32,780
yep you're very sassy uh-huh nothing is

98
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:35,120
saying but never two teachers uh-huh and

99
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:37,760
you're brilliant like your father daddy

100
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:42,440
it's very very smart just like you are

101
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:44,270
now definitely did not get the hey smart

102
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:46,190
genes from sister Christie I got all the

103
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:49,310
good personality genes that matter and

104
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:49,940
you got your looks for me too right good

105
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,350
answer

106
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:54,080
okay so you're just like I was a very

107
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:57,200
very spirited child as you always like

108
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,510
to say so speaking of sister ELISA asks

109
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,920
can you tell one story of James when he

110
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:05,000
was younger that you just knew who was

111
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:08,720
gonna be me just one story because I

112
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,459
have lots of stories oh you did not

113
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,930
sleep through the night until you were

114
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:13,760
two and a half years old your

115
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:15,530
pediatrician recommended the Ferber

116
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,720
method which you let him cry for a few

117
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:19,730
minutes and go in and continue to

118
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,470
increase the time so they realize

119
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:23,270
they're not gonna get anything from

120
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:25,040
crying and they'll eventually soothe

121
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:26,630
themselves back to sleep on their own

122
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,640
you were so determined that you

123
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:32,270
continued to scream and I would leave

124
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:35,030
the house in my car because I couldn't

125
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:36,950
stand listening to you for I would come

126
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:40,160
back an hour two later and you were

127
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:41,930
still crying and it didn't work for you

128
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,330
so daddy and I took you to the

129
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:46,550
pediatrician and asked what was going on

130
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:49,880
and she said most kids would have given

131
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:51,590
up she said James is not gonna be an

132
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:55,040
easy child to parent but he's going to

133
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:59,060
do great things in life oh she said that

134
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,500
really she did Wow and she asked what is

135
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:02,270
your favorite memory together with you

136
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,730
and James spending time on Cape Cod

137
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:06,710
every summer we would rent a house on

138
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:08,630
the Cape and hang out on a beach well

139
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:11,060
that's not true I couldn't sit on the

140
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:12,410
beach I had a chased after you because

141
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,570
you literally would go to the different

142
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:16,820
people and start chatting with them

143
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:20,770
nearly - now you're contouring my nose

144
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:23,060
meaning to make it look more snatched

145
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:24,530
it's not to notice here on the Jim Shaw

146
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:26,360
YouTube channel you have a look at good

147
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:30,169
in tiny nose and you definitely give en

148
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:32,150
your nose so rude because I did not get

149
00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:40,190
that whose nose do you think you have I

150
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:42,200
don't know yeah Paloma sleeves is making

151
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:44,740
a place I am so excited because now it

152
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:47,090
is finally time for the eyebrows and

153
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,380
such as I love my beautiful mother her

154
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:50,720
eyebrows need help

155
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:52,910
oddly she has like three eyebrow hairs

156
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,930
the ones that are there are like 70

157
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:56,240
miles apart

158
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:57,800
I just I'm very very excited about this

159
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,500
today we're gonna give her some advice

160
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:04,100
and Slade and snatched sister brows I

161
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:06,500
can't wait I can't wait I think I put

162
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:08,030
them on nicely when I do I'm not usually

163
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:11,539
taking a brow pencil and draw one line

164
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:13,850
I'm not used to having a full brow so

165
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:16,250
clearly I've never had a lot of eyebrow

166
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:18,650
hairs and I never even penciled them in

167
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:21,050
until probably a few years ago ever

168
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:23,690
Billy yeah and what a difference

169
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:25,580
eyebrows make yeah they change your face

170
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:26,419
they really do I definitely learned that

171
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,830
from you

172
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:30,020
we have my eyebrows are definitely under

173
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:32,479
wet intense transformation for the

174
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:33,620
better on this YouTube makeup journey so

175
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,820
my mom does really have a lot of eyebrow

176
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,260
houses artists Lee helps us a lot

177
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,910
because we have a lot to work with them

178
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:39,650
you can kind of put them wherever we

179
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:42,080
want which is great so I'm starting off

180
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:43,850
this eyebrow by kind of mapping it out

181
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,190
so I'm really extending it the front of

182
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:48,650
her brow like a good probably half an

183
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:50,419
inch in your basic eyebrow should start

184
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:51,979
like right outside of the bridge of your

185
00:06:50,419 --> 00:06:53,810
nose we're gonna send out a little bit

186
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:55,280
Anna making a little bit longer then I'm

187
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:57,349
just calling her natural brow shape and

188
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,729
thickness to fill in the rest of the

189
00:06:57,349 --> 00:07:00,259
and I'm just riding really really light

190
00:06:58,729 --> 00:07:01,969
strokes because she does have a blonde

191
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:03,050
hair and we obviously don't want them to

192
00:07:01,969 --> 00:07:04,969
look like really really dark brown

193
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:06,319
butter just look wonky when I get to the

194
00:07:04,969 --> 00:07:08,210
end of the road I'm just extending that

195
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,909
brow outwards continuing with that art

196
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:13,189
and drawing in a tail at the end to

197
00:07:10,909 --> 00:07:16,099
really finish up her brow sheep and to

198
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:19,009
make a complete and full brow yesterday

199
00:07:16,099 --> 00:07:21,259
when I did your brows I had like a gel

200
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:22,999
would you recommend me using a gel on

201
00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:24,259
James or not the point of Bronto is

202
00:07:22,999 --> 00:07:25,520
really to set the brow hairs in place

203
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:27,259
and kind of push them in the direction

204
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,149
that you want them to go once you

205
00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:30,469
already have your brows filled add so

206
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:32,119
Brown gel is really gonna be more for

207
00:07:30,469 --> 00:07:33,919
people like me who have a lot of brow

208
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:35,629
hairs and if you do fill them in you

209
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,949
want them to all light and like the

210
00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:38,180
right direction but for someone like you

211
00:07:36,949 --> 00:07:39,830
who doesn't really have as many brow

212
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:43,430
hairs brow gel is definitely not

213
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:47,449
necessary okay now the trick is to make

214
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:55,249
the other one look the same way yeah cuz

215
00:07:47,449 --> 00:07:56,990
browser they are how does it feel to

216
00:07:55,249 --> 00:07:58,819
have two eyebrows they look good

217
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:03,339
actually I'm good wow what a difference

218
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:03,339
some eyebrows make huh yeah really does

219
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:16,370
and when I see you next time they're

220
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:19,370
gonna be there okay I can do it a lot of

221
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:21,259
faith trust and some trans powder dust

222
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:23,149
for my mom's eye so today I'm gonna use

223
00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:24,889
the brand new Anasazi a soft glam

224
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:26,539
eyeshadow palette just like the name I

225
00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:28,249
do want to go with a soft glam look

226
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:30,559
today definitely not gonna get my mom a

227
00:08:28,249 --> 00:08:32,329
black smoky eye that is for sure we're

228
00:08:30,559 --> 00:08:34,010
just gonna keep it light and natural I'm

229
00:08:32,329 --> 00:08:35,419
gonna start with my morphe Emma for part

230
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:37,909
one brush and dip into the shade and

231
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:39,889
burnt orange and it's gonna place this

232
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:40,189
all over her lid for a light wash of

233
00:08:39,889 --> 00:08:41,810
color

234
00:08:40,189 --> 00:08:43,579
my mom does have more wrinkly eyelids

235
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:45,500
which is hopefully okay it just comes

236
00:08:43,579 --> 00:08:46,730
with having more mature skin I'm just a

237
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,290
very very gentle when using these

238
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:49,730
windshield wiper motions making sure not

239
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:51,380
to really tug at her eyelid at all

240
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:53,480
because we don't want to create any more

241
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:55,100
wrinkles we just want to get a light

242
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,050
wash of color on there very very nicely

243
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:59,029
and make sure it is evenly distributed

244
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:01,130
and blend it out next time I got my

245
00:08:59,029 --> 00:09:02,870
morphe the ab 4-3-3 brush is my all-time

246
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:04,699
favorite crease brush and packing brush

247
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:05,160
and I mixed together the shades that see

248
00:09:04,699 --> 00:09:07,200
ya

249
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,350
and rustic and his places on the outer

250
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,529
corner

251
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:12,529
[Music]

252
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,730
then I'm just gonna go back into my

253
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,899
blending brush and go over those edges

254
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:22,759
make sure everything gets nice and

255
00:09:17,899 --> 00:09:24,620
blended and buffed out using a flat

256
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:25,759
pocket brush this is Miami two to four

257
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:28,459
I'm gonna dip into the shade it

258
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:32,749
glistening right here and I'm gonna give

259
00:09:28,459 --> 00:09:35,029
it a just quick spritz of mac fix+ and

260
00:09:32,749 --> 00:09:37,550
pop that right on the lid that was a

261
00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:40,639
third different brush for eyeshadow yeah

262
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:48,379
because I'd still use the sponge type

263
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:50,839
thing yes no and don't be saying

264
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:52,670
anything well yeah I mean you still look

265
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:54,290
amazing but you can do your makeup

266
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:56,480
routine in five minutes and I take two

267
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:58,160
hours for my I don't have two hours no

268
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,529
yeah most people don't but what a

269
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,449
difference the bright products and the

270
00:10:00,529 --> 00:10:03,800
right brushes right but you also have to

271
00:10:02,449 --> 00:10:09,829
have a technique James you're an artist

272
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:11,839
I am NOT an artist no my applicator

273
00:10:09,829 --> 00:10:13,970
works just fine huh

274
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,769
next I'm just gonna go this Mac two to

275
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:17,449
one ass brush it's just a tiny little

276
00:10:15,769 --> 00:10:20,089
blender brush and dip it to the

277
00:10:17,449 --> 00:10:22,429
slightest bit of Cypress umber and I do

278
00:10:20,089 --> 00:10:25,160
mean the slightest bit and just put this

279
00:10:22,429 --> 00:10:27,949
right on the outer corner just to create

280
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:29,629
a little tiny bit of dimension I'm then

281
00:10:27,949 --> 00:10:31,160
just gonna go with a Mac Brown a pencil

282
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:34,009
in the shade at chestnut and by my mom's

283
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:35,420
upper waterline she usually uses a black

284
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:36,920
eyeliner but I'm really not a fan of

285
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:38,600
using black when it comes to a softer

286
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,850
clamp look and I think that's just using

287
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:44,300
a light brown will create a more softer

288
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:46,429
more natural look well just what we want

289
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:47,689
I'm gonna pull my mom's eyelid up just

290
00:10:46,429 --> 00:10:49,850
to make sure I'm really getting into the

291
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:51,319
root and base of the lash that is

292
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:53,059
obviously where we want the most color

293
00:10:51,319 --> 00:10:54,319
and most dimension to make the lashes

294
00:10:53,059 --> 00:10:55,730
look more defined and give them more

295
00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:58,040
volume and then I'm just going to

296
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:59,240
lightly sketch in a line when we get to

297
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,759
the outer corner I'm pulling that liner

298
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:03,620
up a little bit not really a fall on

299
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:05,629
away just to give her more dimension and

300
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:07,009
to kind of lift her eyes up I'm next to

301
00:11:05,629 --> 00:11:08,569
take the tiny pocket brush that actually

302
00:11:07,009 --> 00:11:10,429
comes aware that the southland palette

303
00:11:08,569 --> 00:11:12,709
and all the anasazi palettes and dip

304
00:11:10,429 --> 00:11:14,509
into the shade rustic and just lightly

305
00:11:12,709 --> 00:11:16,370
buff this right alongside her lower

306
00:11:14,509 --> 00:11:17,449
lashline no matter what I shadow look

307
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:18,920
I'm going for I think it is really

308
00:11:17,449 --> 00:11:20,839
really important to balance out the top

309
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,800
lid to the bottom lid my mom does

310
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:23,389
however have

311
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,889
small eyes so I'm just using a really

312
00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:26,449
really light wash the color to add a

313
00:11:24,889 --> 00:11:28,639
little bit of dimension but to not close

314
00:11:26,449 --> 00:11:30,199
them up because that is obviously not we

315
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,029
want I'm next indigo to the pretty

316
00:11:30,199 --> 00:11:34,369
vulgar nude liner pencil

317
00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:35,809
I love the formulation of this and like

318
00:11:34,369 --> 00:11:37,129
I said my mom does have smaller eyes so

319
00:11:35,809 --> 00:11:38,629
using a white earned nude in the

320
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:40,699
Waterland is gonna really open them up

321
00:11:38,629 --> 00:11:43,970
and just make them a pop she also has

322
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:46,459
beautiful bluish green eyes thanks for

323
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:48,439
passing that on to me love my Shea Brown

324
00:11:46,459 --> 00:11:50,839
I thought I have going on but it's

325
00:11:48,439 --> 00:11:52,009
really gonna make him cough okay so that

326
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:53,449
is actually I've said a look I'll

327
00:11:52,009 --> 00:11:55,069
complete like my mom was saying her

328
00:11:53,449 --> 00:11:56,509
normal makeup takes her five minutes

329
00:11:55,069 --> 00:11:58,910
this is just a little bit more of a

330
00:11:56,509 --> 00:12:00,589
spicy situation to just brighten up her

331
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:02,720
makeup routine a little bit we literally

332
00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:04,189
did this eye look and I think three or

333
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,749
four eyeshadow brushes but definitely

334
00:12:04,189 --> 00:12:07,339
could have been achieved with a lot less

335
00:12:05,749 --> 00:12:08,629
if you're just an everyday eye makeup

336
00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:11,509
wear and I think this look is beautiful

337
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:13,579
and just makes her eyes very much pop so

338
00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:16,100
our next step to make our eyes pop even

339
00:12:13,579 --> 00:12:17,480
more it's gonna be lashing our necks to

340
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:20,739
have my mom curl her own eyelashes how

341
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:22,579
using just a regular what are you doing

342
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:24,860
if you're like my mom and you don't

343
00:12:22,579 --> 00:12:27,920
really have a lot of lashes thanks dad

344
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:29,089
for giving me these ones it's really

345
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,279
important to curl your lashes and use a

346
00:12:29,089 --> 00:12:33,769
really good mascara to provide a volume

347
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,839
and more dimension and attention to the

348
00:12:33,769 --> 00:12:38,209
eyes for mascara today I'm gonna use the

349
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,559
brand new benefit bad gal bang mascara

350
00:12:38,209 --> 00:12:41,509
this one is really really good and I

351
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:42,709
like the formula a lot and is double

352
00:12:41,509 --> 00:12:44,240
luminizing mascara we're just gonna be

353
00:12:42,709 --> 00:12:46,759
perfect for people like my mom if you

354
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,259
have small eyelashes I'm once again

355
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:50,929
holding my mom's eyelid up to get

356
00:12:48,259 --> 00:12:52,549
maximum access to her lashes and I'm

357
00:12:50,929 --> 00:12:54,170
starting right at the base of the lash

358
00:12:52,549 --> 00:12:55,910
and then just wiggling it upwards make

359
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:58,790
sure all the lashes are nice and coated

360
00:12:55,910 --> 00:13:00,199
and black I'm gonna pop on a pair of

361
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:01,910
false lashes today have you ever

362
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:10,399
actually worn fake lashes before never

363
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:12,559
oh my god are they comfortable to wear

364
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,419
it depends on as you move on correctly

365
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:15,829
they definitely are and I'm gonna be

366
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:17,419
really careful to glue them on and

367
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:18,709
definitely trim them to your lashes I

368
00:13:17,419 --> 00:13:20,059
really like the style because they are

369
00:13:18,709 --> 00:13:22,009
definitely wispy so they're not gonna be

370
00:13:20,059 --> 00:13:23,480
too dramatic and they get longer on the

371
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:25,610
outer edge so it's gonna provide a nice

372
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:27,019
shape to my mom's eye before actually

373
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:28,699
gluing this on I'm going to go ahead and

374
00:13:27,019 --> 00:13:30,199
I'm going to place it on my mom's eyelid

375
00:13:28,699 --> 00:13:30,930
it just with the sticky material that

376
00:13:30,199 --> 00:13:32,910
comes in the

377
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:34,890
look down for me I'm going to kind of

378
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:36,960
measure it to her I like I say my mom

379
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:39,899
does have a very very small eyelids oh

380
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:41,190
yes we have to cut a lot off today it's

381
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:42,450
important to cut your lashes so they

382
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:44,040
flatter your eye shape and the best way

383
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:45,630
possible and also don't poke you and

384
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:49,529
come off all day long

385
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:50,370
Wow look so pretty it's beautiful how

386
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:52,649
does it feel

387
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:55,560
I think maybe I could get used to it

388
00:13:52,649 --> 00:13:58,770
it's gonna be a while it feels heavy

389
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:01,200
heavy yeah yeah I can see like there's

390
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:03,570
something welcome to my world I blink a

00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:06,720

let's go ahead and finish up the rest of

409
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,160
this sister Chrystie clam and makeover

410
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:43,050
today the first thing we have to do is

411
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,910
wipe away this bake because it has been

412
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:46,380
sitting here for quite a long time now

413
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:48,900
and we definitely do not want it to get

414
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:50,940
too baked she's gonna be burnt to the

415
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:54,720
crust from the oven very very shortly

416
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:58,320
don't forget to brush off my thanks for

417
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,160
this Team 5 head up in here after

418
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,620
brushing out the powder I'm gonna

419
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,740
lightly gave her a spritz of the mac

420
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,150
fix+

421
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,620
just to kind of melt everything into her

422
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:06,660
skin so nothing looks really really

423
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:09,209
cakey and textured and of course we have

424
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:11,670
our sister fan we're gonna give her a

425
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:14,430
nice dry off okay we have one question

426
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:16,350
from sister char and C says what is mama

427
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:19,230
Charles as a proudest moment of James

428
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:21,930
would have to be when you graduated high

429
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:25,680
school early you were working part-time

430
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:28,260
and taking very hard classes still doing

431
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,880
YouTube videos and makeup looks till

432
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:32,279
1:00 2:00 in the morning and getting up

433
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:34,329
and going to school and taking driver's

434
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:36,970
ed and you graduated with an ear

435
00:15:34,329 --> 00:15:39,249
perfect average on top of all that on

436
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:41,499
your plate yeah so that was that was a

437
00:15:39,249 --> 00:15:43,089
pretty proud moment thanks mom

438
00:15:41,499 --> 00:15:44,739
I remember having so many arguments with

439
00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:45,999
our family about me graduating early and

440
00:15:44,739 --> 00:15:47,290
wanting to move out to California and

441
00:15:45,999 --> 00:15:48,369
you guys are just like no it's not

442
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:50,019
happening like this is just a hobby

443
00:15:48,369 --> 00:15:51,100
you're gonna get over this which I don't

444
00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:53,259
blame them for because when I was

445
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,980
younger I would always do something do

446
00:15:53,259 --> 00:15:55,389
it for like a month

447
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:57,309
and then get bored and move on so I

448
00:15:55,389 --> 00:15:59,139
honestly I'm still surprised to the say

449
00:15:57,309 --> 00:16:01,839
that I still am like loving makeup and

450
00:15:59,139 --> 00:16:03,249
I'm so so passionate about it but I knew

451
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,420
I wanted to do this and it literally

452
00:16:03,249 --> 00:16:05,920
took me going to the guidance

453
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:08,739
counselor's office without my parents

454
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,689
knowing and setting up like my credits

455
00:16:08,739 --> 00:16:12,369
to graduate early and then me going home

456
00:16:10,689 --> 00:16:15,429
once it was all finalized and saying hey

457
00:16:12,369 --> 00:16:18,850
I'm graduating know the story I'm

458
00:16:15,429 --> 00:16:20,319
graduating next week yeah yes but I knew

459
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:21,730
I needed to get it done and there was so

460
00:16:20,319 --> 00:16:23,350
many arguments about it and nothing was

461
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,980
moving and so I took initiative into my

462
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:26,679
own hands

463
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:28,989
imagine but it paid off it worked out

464
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:32,259
the way it was supposed to but most

465
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:35,470
people who want to be quote-unquote rich

466
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:37,779
and famous it doesn't happen it's a

467
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:39,850
dream which is great to have dreams but

468
00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:42,249
you have to have option B because it

469
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:45,399
doesn't usually happen for most people

470
00:16:42,249 --> 00:16:47,439
and you had an almost perfect average so

471
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:51,970
I assumed you were gonna go to college

472
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:53,319
yeah I know and it worked out again the

473
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:54,910
way it was supposed to but I had a hard

474
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:56,350
time next we're gonna be went to sister

475
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:57,879
Christie lepida doodahs what she

476
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:59,519
definitely needs to have it to find but

477
00:16:57,879 --> 00:17:01,959
they are a little naked aren't they

478
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:04,839
usually wear any kind of lip color

479
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:06,610
really never you know I said when I go

480
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:09,159
out maybe if mom and dad have a date or

481
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:10,269
something date night but on a daily on a

482
00:17:09,159 --> 00:17:13,899
daily basis no I

483
00:17:10,269 --> 00:17:16,299
okay so it's a special occasion my

484
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:17,799
lashes going I gotta have something okay

485
00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:19,689
sort of start by over lighting them

486
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:21,610
using the Mac Baldy Barrett lip pencil I

487
00:17:19,689 --> 00:17:22,929
definitely want to overlay them a little

488
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:26,079
bit to give them a little bit more

489
00:17:22,929 --> 00:17:30,059
volume a little bit more so you over

490
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:30,059
line them with the pencil yeah okay

491
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:35,910
I'm gonna finish them off by filing the

492
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,410
remove the Oprah look and lipstick in

493
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:39,900
the shade of the sow hallo this is my

494
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:45,030
all-time favorite and you can use Coe

495
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:47,280
James for 10 percent 30 Coe James for 30

496
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:49,410
percent off there you go get that

501
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:57,270
