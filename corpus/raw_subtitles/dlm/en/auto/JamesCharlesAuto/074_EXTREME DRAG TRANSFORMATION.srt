00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
hi sisters James Charles here and

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:04,319
welcome back to my youtube channel I'm

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,089
not realizing that I'm starting this

4
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,220
intro off with my eyebrows a hidden

5
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:09,540
third down I probably look crazy but

6
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,920
that should be an indication that the

7
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,420
today's video is going to be a drive a

8
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,670
transformation last night I was watching

9
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,150
my all time favorite show RuPaul's Drag

10
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,310
Race

11
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,500
and the Queen's actually had such a cool

12
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,359
challenge and that was to make over five

13
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,310
different youtube stars first of all

14
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,289
very rude that I was not invited

15
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:27,180
sister rue hit me up girl I would have

16
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:28,680
been an amazing sister transformation

17
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,820
but regardless it just really got me in

18
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,410
the mood and it's been a few months

19
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,170
since I've done drugs and it's been a

20
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,460
lot of months or many months since I've

21
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,780
actually filled the Drock tutorial I've

22
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,920
tried so many new techniques I've been

23
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,329
watching so many different videos and

24
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,920
hopefully I picked up on some brand new

25
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:42,390
things so I just feeling my woman

26
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:48,870
fantasies today and I want to do a drive

27
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:50,760
a transformation started off my eyebrows

28
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,250
are clearly already glued down which is

29
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,410
a very very annoying and long but vital

30
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,969
process to any good drag makeup tutorial

31
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:58,890
I don't think I would look very womanly

32
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:01,289
with the block bushy eyebrows that I

33
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,460
have right now so we got to cover up and

34
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:04,140
draw a new one on it which will be

35
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,610
coming in a short minute but I'm gonna

36
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,860
start off by priming and moisturize my

37
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,360
face that I using the touch-ups self-cam

38
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,850
bests just gonna put a light layer of

39
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,130
this over my t-zone especially in my

40
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:16,350
moustache and beard region just to kind

41
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,880
of correct any texture before I go into

42
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,380
any foundation and really kind of clean

43
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,030
up the canvas for all the makeup they're

44
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,439
about to put on we have one last step

45
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,330
which is going to be a color cocktail

46
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:26,040
I'm gonna take the LA girl Pro concealer

47
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,330
and this is in the shade of orange and

48
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,479
I'm gonna put this over oh God

49
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:33,360
cut I put this over all my oh hello all

50
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:37,170
my beard and moustache areas I literally

51
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,790
am a man and I shave it every morning

52
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,220
but I still get 5 o'clock shadow like

53
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,509
three hours later I'm very tempted in

54
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,670
convinced that I want to get laser

55
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:46,290
surgery so please let us know your

56
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,000
experience with that if it's fun if it's

57
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,890
painful because I literally do not know

58
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,600
but I'm really tempted to get all this

59
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,350
gone and I'm also gonna put a little bit

60
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,759
of this over my eyebrows as well because

61
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:58,710
they're a little dark and by a little

62
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:00,179
bit I mean cover them up completely I'm

63
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:02,130
next good to take any dent a buffing

64
00:02:00,179 --> 00:02:03,600
brush and lightly tap out this concealer

65
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:05,610
just so it's kind of evenly distributed

66
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,810
and blend it all around because our next

67
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,940
up is going to be it to set it with

68
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:10,470
powder but if we put powder right on top

69
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,930
of it it's gonna be a little bit clumpy

70
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:14,849
and grow so this is just a quick little

71
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,319
step in between alright guys this is the

72
00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:17,849
completed look I really hope you guys

73
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,950
enjoyed and I will see you in the next

74
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:20,970
line I'm gonna take a powder puff in a

75
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,620
little bit of translucent powder and

76
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:24,480
just packet or right over top of that

77
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,980
formed just to set it in place until we

78
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,140
put the foundation on next it doesn't

79
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,519
all get mixed together because although

80
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:32,069
we definitely want a bronzed look we

81
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:33,510
don't want a Donald Trump glam today

82
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:35,340
that's for sure

83
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:37,620
I'm also gonna pack this powder into the

84
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,760
brows as well I have gotten pretty good

85
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,989
at brow cover at this point and I've

86
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,370
also shown it in a few other videos

87
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:42,870
beforehand so make sure to click right

88
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,040
up here if you needed to trial on that I

89
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,630
know I started off this video with it

90
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,160
but it's a very long process and I did

91
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:48,480
not want to waste 20 minutes of your

92
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,890
time teaching you how to glue down your

93
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,720
eyebrows today pressing in this powder

94
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,890
really hard after all the layers of glue

95
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,239
will really help eliminate some of that

96
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:56,370
texture and the powder will kind of fill

97
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,739
everything in to create a very blank and

98
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:01,139
a flat base for everything to go over

99
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:02,220
top of this is scary for the foundation

100
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,630
today I'm going to go into the Kryolan

101
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,880
TV paint stick and this is in the shade

102
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:07,049
and B if you guys have never heard of

103
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,930
these foundation sticks before they are

104
00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:11,519
intense arla straightest police they're

105
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:15,030
literally full coverage enough to cover

106
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,680
my scandalous so we definitely love this

107
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:18,120
and we have a whole lot that we need to

108
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,790
cover today so I'm going to just go into

109
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,230
this all over my face starting off with

110
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:24,209
the brows and once again are really

111
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:26,250
pushing it in their gouge make sure

112
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:28,769
everything is all covered and then it's

113
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,970
going in with that everywhere else and

114
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:31,410
there's gonna take a damp Beauty Blender

115
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:32,849
this one is a very very old one it you

116
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:34,560
definitely do not want to use a new one

117
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:35,730
that is for sure because this is full

118
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,109
coverage and I can guarantee you you're

119
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:39,810
gonna have to throw this out after this

120
00:03:37,109 --> 00:03:41,069
video trust me then I'm gonna grab the

121
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:42,989
Krylon T paint stick in the shade at

122
00:03:41,069 --> 00:03:44,370
zerozero this one is already just pure

123
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:46,410
white and I'm gonna use this to

124
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:48,750
highlight my face starting off right in

125
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:52,040
the center in between the brows just

126
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:52,040
like that that I'm going to do one line

127
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:57,930
oops the nose huh we'll get her there

128
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,860
I'm just gonna put this in the same

129
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:01,490
place that I always put my concealer

130
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:04,110
except this is just white as opposed to

131
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:04,890
normal shades and then once again just

132
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,270
gonna bond that in with a Beauty Blender

133
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:07,740
if you're watching this video I feel

134
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:09,960
like it's probably safe to assume that

135
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,980
at least most of you guys have seen the

136
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,180
show or at least heard of the show

137
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,770
RuPaul's Drag Race

138
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,060
literally when my favorite shows in the

139
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:17,760
entire world and if you don't know what

140
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:20,280
it is and is a drag queen TV competition

141
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:22,590
show hosted by the legendary RuPaul and

142
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:25,200
this season has been so beyond

143
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:26,580
entertaining and crazy whereas his

144
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,680
favorite slava discussion down the

145
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,730
comments below aquaria literally love

146
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,200
her the most I've been following her

147
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:33,180
since she had like 30,000 followers on

148
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,220
Instagram and now she's on season 10

149
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,990
which is so crazy she actually do my

150
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:39,000
makeup two years ago when I was in New

151
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:40,680
York for I think generation beauty which

152
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,420
is a baby Beauty convention and it was

153
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,430
so cool meeting her and just seeing her

154
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:45,480
progression I literally love her makeup

155
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:48,390
so today's look is deathly gonna be

156
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:50,070
heavily influenced by aquaria I also

157
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:51,840
love Eureka I'd not heard personally a

158
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:52,860
few times and she is literally one of

159
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,600
the sweetest people ever in the entire

160
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,160
oath and I think she deserves every

161
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,080
single ounce of her success she is so

162
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,000
funny and we definitely need a bigger a

163
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,830
winner I think it's time so my fingers

164
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,780
are crossed for her definitely the

165
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:05,550
season I also live for when I exchange

166
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:08,010
this entire season all from the sponges

Queens doing this a lot of we start off

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,260
with their eyebrows first can't do that

176
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,270

177
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:25,470
clearly I have to cover mine but I wanna

178
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:27,750

hello

184
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,100
I hate drawing and eyebrows

185
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:43,910
I'm not like that eyebrow dry eyebrows

186
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:45,800
as a directory is so hard like oh this

187
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:47,180
is the research Alan Turing oh no it's

188
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,320
taking out my foundation underneath my

189
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,810
eyebrow what the heck

190
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,280
yes okay this is kind of a wash roughly

191
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:53,780
I literally don't understand how drag

192
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,460
queens cover their eyebrows and then can

193
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:57,530
draw on new eyebrows and have it look

194
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:59,000
like smooth and not crusted I am pretty

195
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:00,650
good at broad cover at this point but no

196
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,650
matter what like something always still

197
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:05,780
looks so wrong when I clean that up that

198
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:07,640
could be usable oh that's an ugly

199
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:09,890
eyebrow how do people do this

200
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:11,150
that is way too large like why is that

201
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:12,800
all the way up there it's like all the

202
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,340
way on my forehead I hate this what's

203
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,960
going on

204
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:16,490
okay these literally look the worst but

205
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,990
you know what that's we have concealer

206
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:19,220
for and thank God that I do not set

207
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:22,310
these in place because now I'm gonna

208
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:24,680
grab some shape tape and a mac 242 brush

209
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:26,770
a lot of shaved tape but I'm gonna go

210
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,590
and clean up these brows

211
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:33,820
[Music]

212
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:37,840
Oh see the hustle whoa man that's a

213
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:40,419
woman mm-hmm okay we love her concealer

214
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,730
whoo no this one on the other hand oh

215
00:06:40,419 --> 00:06:45,870
she's the struggle sister it's always

216
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:47,919
the eyebrows that get me good every time

217
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:49,930
I'll be good again

218
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:51,730
all right so literally 45 minutes later

219
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:54,130
and no I'm not kidding

220
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:55,990
wish I was but hope brows are now on and

221
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:57,669
even so what I'm gonna do is just go in

222
00:06:55,990 --> 00:07:00,100
quickly and blend out any creases that I

223
00:06:57,669 --> 00:07:01,780
gathered underneath my eyes while crying

224
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,070
over my brows looking horrible then it's

225
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:05,139
gonna take a dent powder puffs in some

226
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:07,240
Kody or some powder whoo and I'm gonna

227
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:10,090
set my entire face including my brows

228
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,500
with this let's see if this works okay

229
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:14,050
so far so good

230
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,340
this took 60,000 euros I think I

231
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:17,229
actually like this technique of doing my

232
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:18,639
brows while the creams are still wet a

233
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:20,290
lot more than drawing them on later on

234
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,639
thanks sister Asha I'll definitely be

235
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:24,130
doing this okay so now that the face is

236
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:26,500
all set and locked right in place we

237
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:28,540
have to a contour and contour is a very

238
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,950
very vital step to drag makeup I mean

239
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,570
that you have to go from a brother to

240
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:33,520
his sister so we definitely do add a lot

241
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:36,160
more dimension and back to the face so

242
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,840
I'm gonna grab my morphe m55 4 brush and

243
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,729
the anasazi a contour kit and dip into

244
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,840
at the lightest shade right up in here

245
00:07:39,729 --> 00:07:42,280
and just add this right over the same

246
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:47,740
places that I put the white highlight

247
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:48,820
earlier gonna pop this right oh okay I'm

248
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:51,070
actually gonna take the jeffree star

249
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:52,870
cosmetics blood shook her eye shut up

250
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,830
hello and dip into the shade glucose

251
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,690
which is literally just a white

252
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:57,070
eyeshadow with the same exact brush but

253
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:59,110
I know that this white is very very

254
00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:00,610
pigmented so I'm gonna use a little bit

255
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:02,590
of it to highlight the center of my face

256
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:04,389
I was gonna place the shade right

257
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:06,460
underneath my eyes right up against my

258
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:08,680
nose contour to brighten up the center

259
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:10,360
oh why should he use the k'kaw powder

260
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,440
I'm gonna grab the k'kaw Beauty

261
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,510
brightening powder and the shade number

262
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,610
1 and the same exact brush to use that

263
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:16,780
to highlight my face instead and then

264
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:17,950
we're gonna go back into the Augusta's

265
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:21,280
their contour kit and I'm going to use

266
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:23,050
my morphe M 405 and use this to chisel

267
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,820
on my face I'm sorting right at the top

268
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:27,370
of my ear right in my sideburn region

269
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:29,020
and doing a circular motions going right

270
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:30,610
down and I'm kind of keeping this

271
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:32,620
contour a little bit higher than I would

272
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:34,630
normally go for more of a feminine

273
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:38,079
lifted at cheekbone type look

274
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:40,810
yeah just like that pretty we love

275
00:08:38,079 --> 00:08:42,579
same thing on the other side definitely

276
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:43,209
need to really chisel out my five head

277
00:08:42,579 --> 00:08:44,649
as well

278
00:08:43,209 --> 00:08:46,870
and when contouring I'm kind of blending

279
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:47,949
in it like a circular motion if that

280
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:49,389
makes sense we're like the lightest

281
00:08:47,949 --> 00:08:52,949
point being right here and then kind of

282
00:08:49,389 --> 00:08:56,350
fading out circular ombre sunset

283
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:58,149
situation into a very very dark hairline

284
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:59,259
of course you have to also snap to the

285
00:08:58,149 --> 00:09:01,240
no so I'm just going to grab my benefit

huge inspiration for me when it came to

292
00:09:11,949 --> 00:09:15,490
learning how to in nose contour and

293
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:17,620

snatched to really finish off and

304
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:38,410
brighten that nose I'm gonna take the

305
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:40,839
NYX jumbo eye pencil in the shade milk

306
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:42,040
this is the pure white one I am scared

307
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:43,209
to do this but once again I've seen a

308
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,100
lot of different Queens do this so

309
00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:46,660
hopefully this will work first mr.

310
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:49,830
genius and I'm gonna put a little dollop

311
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:54,890
right on the tip

312
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:56,370
[Music]

313
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:59,130
you're kidding

314
00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:00,360
hello either worked and lasted finally

315
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:01,830
not least for the bass I'm just gonna go

316
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,120
to my Mac peaches blast you guys all

317
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:05,400
this is my all-time favorite on my

318
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:08,279
morphe e for brush and give myself an

319
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:10,740
actual for once really decent coverage a

320
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:12,480
blush you guys know I don't usually like

321
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,770
a lot of blush in my looks but when it

322
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,180
comes to drive we do have to make the

323
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:16,980
highlights and the contours a lot more

324
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:18,600
intense so blushes are really nice job

325
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:20,970
of marrying everything together for a

326
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,170
more soft but still intense look so

327
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:24,150
finally the base is done we get to move

328
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:25,830
on to the eyes thank the Lord but I do

329
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:27,660
want to do one last thing before we do

330
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:29,400
and that is a bake our face to really

331
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,870
intensify the highlights even more so

332
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,370
I'm gonna grab a little bit more of the

333
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:34,080
Cody Harrison powder in my damp Beauty

334
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:35,820
sponge Center it's going to bake okay so

335
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,839
let's move right ahead with the eyes at

336
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,400
the first palette I want to go in with

337
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:40,410
the city is the Jeffrey's top Balai de

338
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,089
sugar eyeshadow palette and I'm gonna

339
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:43,950
grab the shade glucose first which is

340
00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:45,600
this white shade right up here and use

341
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:47,610
this to highlight the brow bone this is

342
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,130
by far one of the most pigmented

343
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:51,240
eyeshadows I have ever used and I

344
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:52,470
definitely want to give the brown one a

345
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,270
good highlight to kind of lift

346
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:56,250
everything up next I'm gonna grab a big

347
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:58,020
fluffy brush this is the morphe m4 for

348
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,910
one use Cody's for ten percent off and

349
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:01,770
dip into the shade out and just use this

350
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:03,959
as a light transition shade I'm gonna

351
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:05,550
pop this color right above the crease

352
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:07,620
and just blend this up right into the

353
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:09,750
white just to give a nice wash of color

354
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:11,490
and to get the eye makeup started I'm

355
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,870
next gonna switch over to the morphe 39

356
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:14,160
a palette this is the palette that I

357
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:16,140
actually modeled for for the morphe

358
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,880
Holiday Collection unfortunately it is

359
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:19,500
now sold out and gone for good but

360
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,120
basically I'm just gonna be using cool

361
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,800
toned brown shadows today so use any

362
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,000
palette that has similar shades using a

363
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,940
fluffy crease brush I'm gonna dip into

364
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,810
this shade right over here and I can use

365
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,220
just to deepen up the crease a little

366
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:31,500
bit I'm just using little circular

367
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:33,480
motions to really build up a color once

368
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,310
again staying right above that natural

369
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,170
crease line because we're gonna make our

370
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:38,640
eyes look way bigger then going a

371
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:41,070
smaller pointed fluffy brush this is the

372
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:43,440
morphe M 506 I'll get a dip into this

373
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:45,120
dark brown shade right up in here and

374
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,800
use that to really deepen elephant it's

375
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,240
going back into my big fluffy brush I'm

376
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,500
going to blend that out a little bit and

377
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,180
make sure that doesn't look too harsh

378
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,650
now that we have our crease shadow all

379
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:54,300
laid out and nice and blends and I'm

380
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:56,610
gonna take a white concealer this is the

381
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:59,940
LA girl Pro concealer in the shade white

382
00:11:56,610 --> 00:12:00,520
obviously hello and a mac 242 brush and

383
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:03,670
just cut out

384
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:05,470
crease perfect Wow cool once again good

385
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:06,910
a dip back into that Murphy M 2 2 4 and

386
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:08,410
the Caloocan shade from the blood sugar

387
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:10,270
pellet and then set that white in place

388
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:11,950
I do add a little bit of sparkle and

389
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:13,480
glow to the lid so I'm gonna grab this

390
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:16,180
Stila liquid metals in the shade of

391
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:18,130
Perlina and put this over the white area

392
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:19,390
that I just set in place then before

393
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:22,300
that sets in place I'm gonna pack on the

394
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:23,860
mixed glitter in the shade mg/l io5 and

395
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,150
then to be really active before we go

396
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:27,340
ahead and add the winged liner I want to

397
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:29,230
do one last step and that is gonna be to

398
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:30,100
glue on some individual sourav ski

399
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:31,780
crystals

400
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,610
I learned this trick from and Naomi

401
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:35,650
smalls and always look so stunning from

402
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:37,570
far away the crystals just sparkles so

403
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:39,160
beautifully on the lid so I'm gonna pop

404
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:40,900
a few on it just using lash glue and

405
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,580
tweezers so next up in the eyes is going

406
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:44,740
to be the way NAT / like outer shadow

407
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:46,840
moment and I try to do this technique in

408
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:49,000
my Coachella festival makeup store but

409
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:50,830
it did not work at all so we're gonna

410
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,540
try again today fingers crossed

411
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:53,890
I know aquaria does this all the time in

412
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,870
her looks and it always looks the best

413
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:56,950
so I need to have faith myself but I'm

414
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:58,420
gonna take just a light piece of

415
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:01,150
cardboard i hey I'm miss Laura Lee this

416
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:03,580
is from her PR package and just a fluffy

417
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:06,340
brush and dip into a block I shadow

418
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:10,090
wish me luck tap off the excess and I'm

419
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:11,620
gonna place this card right here on my

420
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:14,440
face right up against my on I'm gonna

421
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:16,030
press it very firmly into my skin and

422
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,830
then I'm just gonna go right in and

423
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:19,840
start blending the block right up

424
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:22,270
against our blending on at the edge

425
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,980
blending in the crease just making sure

426
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:25,720
it looks like nice and not super super

427
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:27,430
harsh then before I remove that I'm

428
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,050
gonna take a blending brush from before

429
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:32,170
they had the brown on it and go over

430
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:35,050
this edge right here and then when I

431
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:37,510
remove that yeah work this time we have

432
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:39,790
a nice and defined black line oh thank

433
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:41,620
god okay great thanks Laura Lee and I'm

434
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:44,950
gonna continue this block right down

435
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:47,160
into the corner of my eye to prepare to

436
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:50,160
bring it into the lower lash line in a

437
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,160
second

438
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:54,529
once a black shadows on that I'm just

439
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:56,029
gonna go to the black liquid liner and

440
00:13:54,529 --> 00:13:58,130
just line right up against that

441
00:13:56,029 --> 00:14:01,190
waterline just when we put on lashes

442
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:03,650
there's no like weird shadow moments so

443
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:05,270
that is the top lid all complete huh a

444
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:06,920
lot goes into drag makeup as you can see

445
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:08,210
but let's go to move on to the bottom

446
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,660
lower lash line which will be a whole

447
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:10,100
lot easier

448
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:12,050
think on I'm first gonna shout wrecking

449
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:14,420
that NYX jumbo eye pencil in milk once

450
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:15,320
again and lining my lower lash line then

451
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,310
when they get to the inner corner

452
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,720
instead of following my natural eye

453
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:19,279
shape I'm kind of extending that white

454
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:21,440
down a little bit to kind of follow

455
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,670
straight forward and out once again I'm

456
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,800
gonna set that white in place using the

457
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:26,450
glucose single shadow from the blood

458
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,650
sugar palette next to begin the shadow

459
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:29,060
portion I'm just gonna dip into the same

460
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:31,100
a block that I used for the upper lash

461
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:33,110
line top off the access and be super

462
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:34,880
careful I'm going to blend this right

463
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:36,890
along the lower lash line connecting the

464
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,180
wing right up in the outer corner and

465
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:40,220
then using a small fluffy crease brush

466
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:42,320
is the morphine I'm a 4-3-3 I'm gonna

467
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:43,700
dip into that same cool tone a brown

468
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,440
transition shade from before and just

469
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:47,180
blend right underneath the crease and

470
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,950
into the inner corner and last but

471
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:50,990
finally not least to complete the eyes

472
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:53,900
today I thank the Lord in heaven above

473
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:56,630
is going to be the lashes and for

474
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:58,760
today's look we have BAM the three oh

475
00:14:56,630 --> 00:15:00,410
ones if you are a true drag fan you know

476
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:02,420
that these are like the best of the best

477
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:04,610
they are intense but they look so

478
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:06,500
stunning and when you have this much eye

479
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:08,690
makeup on you have to match it with a

480
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:10,280
good and fresh lash so all I did was

481
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:12,170
stock any regular pair of Lillie lashes

482
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,700
in the style I believe Miami you guys

483
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:14,839
all those my all-time faves and I use

484
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,820
those because they held a little bit of

485
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:18,710
a lift to them and just glued a 301

486
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:20,990
right over top and I'm gonna pop that on

487
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:24,470
my lash line for a very very 3d and

488
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:26,330
lifted and beautiful stunning look I

489
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:28,040
usually like to apply my lashes kind of

490
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:29,900
in the middle but for these I'm actually

491
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:32,330
gonna push on the inner corner of the

492
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:35,120
lash first being that that is by far the

493
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:36,830
most important part to this look and I'm

494
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,420
gonna take the outer corner of the Lodge

495
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:40,339
and lift it out to make sure that it's

496
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:42,470
on the regular lashes and they're gonna

497
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:44,270
place it down but what I actually put

498
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:46,670
this lash there I'm not gonna put the

499
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:48,950
lash on my lash line I'm actually gonna

500
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:51,050
put it a little bit above my natural

501
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:53,330
lash line which is going to lift my

502
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:55,010
entire eye upwards obviously this is

503
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:56,480
totally optional not gonna lie it does

504
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:57,410
feel a little bit weird to have your

505
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,660
lash glue

506
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:00,769
of your eyelid but it really does help

507
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:03,290
and give the face a little bit of a

508
00:16:00,769 --> 00:16:05,089
lifted look and then also since the area

509
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:06,889
is fully covered in eyeliner you can't

510
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:08,329
even tell and it's a full-on illusion

511
00:16:06,889 --> 00:16:09,410
and finally just gonna pop on a little

512
00:16:08,329 --> 00:16:11,300
bit of my favorite mascara to blend

513
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:13,819
together my fake lashes with their

514
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:15,050
really large big quads helpful hand too

515
00:16:13,819 --> 00:16:16,970
if you're like me and you have a pretty

516
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:18,529
long bottom lashes and you decide to do

517
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:20,180
this like white in a corner moment like

518
00:16:18,529 --> 00:16:21,649
I have right here when you're applying

519
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:23,990
your mascara especially to the lashes in

520
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:24,889
the bottom corner be really careful and

521
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:27,259
pay attention to where you're actually

522
00:16:24,889 --> 00:16:28,970
holding the wand because you should try

523
00:16:27,259 --> 00:16:30,589
to avoid putting mascara right at the

524
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:33,230
root on the inner corner and only get

525
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:35,180
the mascara on the kind of second half

526
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:37,430
of the lash if that makes sense and keep

527
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:39,319
that first half of the lash white from

528
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:40,819
the eye liner because then it keeps that

529
00:16:39,319 --> 00:16:41,930
illusion going of the white inner corner

530
00:16:40,819 --> 00:16:44,209
with the black mascara underneath

531
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:45,649
because if you get black mascara all the

532
00:16:44,209 --> 00:16:47,029
way up to the root in this inner corner

533
00:16:45,649 --> 00:16:48,379
right here it's gonna try to get away

534
00:16:47,029 --> 00:16:51,110
from that illusion I just like I have on

535
00:16:48,379 --> 00:16:53,269
this lash but you get what I mean

536
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:55,250
hopefully all three sisters and finally

537
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:56,930
that is what I all complete I am

538
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:58,430
literally loving how this is hurting Cal

539
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:59,629
so far I'm gonna go ahead and do the

540
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:01,339
other one off camera quickly and I'll be

541
00:16:59,629 --> 00:17:03,319
right back to finish off with Rosenblum

542
00:17:01,339 --> 00:17:04,339
okay so those are both eyes all complete

543
00:17:03,319 --> 00:17:06,409
and I was a little bit worried about

544
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:07,939
this look at first not gonna lie I've

545
00:17:06,409 --> 00:17:09,530
never really confident in my full job

546
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:11,959
looks until they come together but now

547
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:14,030
oh my god I am really loving this I

548
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:16,069
really I just wrapped Aquarius face

549
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:18,020
right over and just popped it right on

550
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:20,480
wide and I am loving I feel beautiful

551
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:22,760
so let's go ahead and move on our next

552
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,439
was going to be the glow I'm bursting my

553
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,449
skin a good spread to the max like plus

554
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:28,580
being that I've literally put on 64

555
00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:30,650
million pounds of makeup and powder and

556
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,610
my skin's feelings love it dry but

557
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:34,490
highlighter today I'm going to dip into

558
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:36,559

559
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:38,630

[Music]

566
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:55,890
for the lips today I definitely feel

567
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,360
like I go with the nude when it comes to

568
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:58,920
draw it looks a lot so I don't want to

569
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,710
do that and for today's look I want to

570
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:03,960
do a really really bright red so I'm

571
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:05,790
going to use the kylie boss lip liner to

572
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,320
outline them first and we have to over

573
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:08,610
line of course then I'm just gonna fill

574
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:15,510
this then using the matching Carly

575
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:16,980
liquid lipstick eraser so we are all

576
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:18,960
done and the last of the day is going to

577
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:21,330
be it to lock this face in place so your

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,380

579
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:24,480
