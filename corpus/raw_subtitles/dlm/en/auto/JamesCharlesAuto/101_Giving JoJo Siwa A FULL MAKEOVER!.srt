thing that i want to ask you about

68
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,440
before this video is today before we

69
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,480

70
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,120
that i want to ask you about

71
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,239
okay i texted you asking to collaborate

72
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,080
on february 7th

73
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:21,680

74
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,040
yes okay i want to do a video together

75
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,840
so bad where i give you a full

76
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,200
transformation

77
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,720
yes and talk about how your business

78
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,560
will go all these things you literally

79
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,360
responded and i quote

80
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,760
hey sorry i can't do that i did well

81
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,000
okay

82
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,120
at the time you have to think i was 15.

83
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,599
yes that was

84
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,239
a lot scarier to me because i was so

85
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,599
young

86
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,959
you know well so like this is obviously

87
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,840
something very very different for you

88
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,120
and we're doing this like full

89
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,599
transformation where i want to turn you

90
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,280
into

91
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,800
not an instagram body but a and just

92
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,239
like a glam

93
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,480
we met in the middle i didn't want to be

94
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,840
an instagram baddie but i understand

95
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,040
but i also was like yeah let's do

96
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,840
something different like i get why you

97
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,599
wouldn't want to do

98
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,200
a pink unicorn look because what's the

99
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,599
difference you know i feel like when i

100
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,879
first

101
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,319
wanted to do the collaboration with you

102
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,840
it was with good intentions like i

103
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,159
wanted to give you a full makeover but i

104
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,760
think

105
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,959
at that time you know a big thing in the

106
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,319
internet is like a lot of people think

107
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,680
you're like acting or this is like some

108
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,879
crazy character for you i

109
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,319
was even one of those people that made

110
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,599
me believe like okay maybe this is some

111
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,319
sort of like act like

112
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,599
let's go like the real jojo but like now

113
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,560
i'm understanding like this is the

114
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,959
glitters the bows

115
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,159
everything it's all like so many people

116
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,480
do you think it's a character

117
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,080
and like the reason why it works for me

118
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,000
and like where my life is how it is is

119
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,080
because it's not a character you know

120
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,760
and like i'm in charge you know at the

121
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,200
end of the day like it really is me in

122
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,040
charge obviously i have nickelodeon and

123
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,400
i'm a manager and i'm my mom but like

124
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,720
they're all working

125
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,400
under me if that makes sense right like

126
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,760
it's we everyone i work with like i

127
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,200
don't want to be like you're the boss or

128
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,640
i'm the boss like i want to just like

129
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,200
figure it out together yeah no yeah

130
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,480
that's very

131
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,159
we are very much the same way here at my

132
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,640
team lovely there's little glitter

133
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,720
everywhere

134
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,480
i know is there always glitter ever on

135
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,599
you yes my house like if you walk

136
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,799
through my house your feet will just

137
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,560
turn glitter oh that's great

138
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,159
it's insane but no i obviously like i

139
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,000
wanted to do a video with you always

140
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,000
like your james charles but i was like i

141
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,519
just i can't but i don't know what to do

142
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,040
but i can't do it but i want to do it

143
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,239
but i wanted it i don't know

144
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,760
well i think what opened back up the

145
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,360
conversation was honestly like when you

146
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,159
started posting your tech talks totally

147
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,599
because i feel like

148
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,959
we've seen you in glitters and bows and

149
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,760
rhinestones for so long and that is

150
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,000
classic jojo

151
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,200
i started to kind of explore yes and for

152
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,959
me like as a fan

153
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,239
i was like oh my god this is so exciting

154
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,040
and as a friend who would ask you to

155
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:21,440
collab i was like

156
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,199
oh she's giving the reveal that i wanted

157
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,560
makeup all the time my makeup is such a

158
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,919
huge part of my brand but like i

159
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,440
am in sweatpants at the end of each time

160
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,560
totally so i think it's so cool that

161
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,280
you're like not afraid to show that

162
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,199
although for the

163
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,639
longest time i actually did sleep with a

164
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,120
bow and a side ponytail

165
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,560
i don't anymore but like dance moms days

166
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,680
yeah every single night literally every

167
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,639
single night joe doe

168
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,320
i would wake up and i would just

169
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,400
re-slick my hair oh yeah take my

170
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,000
hairline make them really receding

171
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,360
so far back we're gonna put some good

172
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,199
contour to really bring it forward i

173
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,520
love it i want to ask you because i feel

174
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,600
like

175
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,880
dancehalls was my absolute favorite show

176
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,479
growing up i've seen every single

177
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,080
episode every single season i would

178
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,440
challenge you to a dance moms who knows

179
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,560
more well considering were on the show i

180
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,040
think you'd probably wear

181
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,400
free when i was on the show oh that show

182
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,600
was literally my everything and i feel

183
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,000
like a lot of the girls that were on the

184
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,360
show

185
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,880
no shade to anything because i love all

186
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,160
them don't like talking they don't like

187
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,039
talking about it yeah but i like that

188
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,240
you still do

189
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,680
everybody can do whatever they want

190
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,039
totally of course i feel like the show

191
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,479
was literally your guys's childhood so

192
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,960
of course everyone like has a right to

193
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,240
do

194
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,759
whatever they want about it like is

195
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,280
there a reason that you still do talk

196
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,280
about it and like so openly

197
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,120
you know at the end of the day dance

198
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,560
moms was our lives and it was a reality

199
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,639
tv show and it wasn't scripted

200
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,160
but like at the same time like it was a

201
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,560
tv show you know and like

202
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,479
off camera like it was always so much

203
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,440
fun and for me i think i can just see

204
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,440
like past

205
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,720
all the bad and like i don't want to

206
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,919
remember the bad memories you know you

207
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,520
always have a choice in life to look at

208
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,360
the bright side of the dark side yes

209
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,800
i think very much the same way totally

210
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,479
and for me with dance i was like i just

211
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,759
try to remember like the fun memories

212
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,800
and like hanging out with abby and

213
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,320
hanging out with the girls and hanging

214
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,600
out with the crew and doing school like

215
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,199
going to the competitions and being

216
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,080
stressed but then like the winning you

217
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,919
know it's like i

218
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,440
know that i would be nothing without

219
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,960
dance moms like it's where i started

220
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,560
it's what got me my platform

221
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,840
and so without it i'd be nowhere and so

222
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,800
i was like you gotta remember where you

223
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,120
came from you know

224
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,400
always always come on cover girl no yeah

225
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,360
literally i don't remember i was gonna

226
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,080
say it's really cool to look at it that

227
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,360
way like i

228
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,880
obviously i like how the opportunity

229
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,000
working with covergirl i don't actively

230
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,520
do anything with them

231
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,680
anymore anymore but like i'm i'm so

232
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,120
great i would never talk bad about them

233
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,639
like they literally gave me the platform

234
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,759
that i have today and like i'm so

235
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,840
grateful for that like i didn't know her

236
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,680
without covergirl so oops excuse me

237
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,880
i've never actually put concealer on

238
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,639
what i don't do it

239
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,000
you're kidding no i'm giving it to you

240
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,199
gal so you were just speaking about how

241
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,240
you always like to look at the positives

242
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,680
and things and i

243
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,360
love that and i very much think the same

244
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,199
way how do you always stay

245
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,960
so positive and so bubbly and like does

246
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,160
that ever turn off especially when the

247
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,840
cameras are off no

248
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,280
it never turns off the only thing that

249
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,840
happens is i'm not gonna

250
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,800
i wouldn't say the word shy but like in

251
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,960
public i'm either

252
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,479
super extrovert or super introvert like

253
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,000
i just like my group of people like i

254
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,479
don't like if i'm at like a party

255
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,919
i'm so like in my little bubble but yeah

256
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,479
i don't know i just like to stay really

257
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,319
positive

258
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,280
i don't really have like a switch that

259
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,080
goes off it's just like kind of

260
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,440
whatever's in the moment

261
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,120
yeah i feel that it depends on where i'm

262
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,120
around but how i stay positive

263
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,319
is really my people around me i always

264
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,759
say like you have to have a good team

265
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,720
obviously because that's who you work

266
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,560
with every day

267
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,479
but you also have to good have good

268
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,440
friends you know and i i have i have

269
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,120

and the best friends in the whole world

271
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,720
i feel like we honestly have quite a lot

272
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,120
of like similarities just in terms of

273
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,639
our internet existences we both have

274
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,240
really loyal fan bases but i feel like a

275
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,120
lot of people outside of our fan bases

276
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,720
find us annoying

277
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,639

278
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,319

279
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,160

282
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,000
changed like for the better it's insane

288
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,240

currently baking in the oven at 300

399
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:01,839
degrees

400
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,839
no we're not very bad

401
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,839
the brows are both on how do you feel

402
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,720
about them because you've never had your

403
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,720
brows done that you like

404
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,720
you know i i'm sticking to my plan i

405
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,040
look like a dude but i'm here i don't i

406
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,800
did completely disagree i'm here for it

407
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,440
but i want to give my opinions on the

408
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,519
final look

409
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,160
okay so type eye shadow okay see all

410
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:32,240
these nice and rainbow colors

411
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,760
we should use those we're actually not

412
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,320
going to today why not we could use like

413
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,519
the pink

414
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,279
the whole point is that we're taking it

415
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,320
completely out of your comfort zone so i

416
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,200
kind of want to do something like

417
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,600
neutral

418
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,959
and like just like we'll go in like

419
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,800
fully opposite of me

420
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,399

421
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,720

427
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,320
