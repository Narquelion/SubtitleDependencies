00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,190
back to our YouTube channel of course

that enter normally comes before my

53
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:13,520
videos but I felt like this one was

54
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,900
appropriate to just kind of go right

55
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,430
into things I really hope you guys

56
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,750
enjoyed this little song moment that

57
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:19,280
just happened there for today's video

58
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,510
there's been a huge trend going around

59
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,400
recently where different youtubers are

60
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,990
making their own districts and you guys

61
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,220
know me I definitely love a bit of self

62
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:26,660
roast this morning I was actually

63
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,770
pulling through hate comments getting

64
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,300
ready to record a thing you may hate

65
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:30,710
comments video inspired by Colleen

66
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,060
ballinger and everybody else who is

67
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:34,010
doing this trend including at Gabby

68
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:36,110
Hannah and laurdiy and literally writing

69
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:38,660
this first some reason just kept getting

70
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:39,800
more and more and more deep this is kind

71
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,720
of sauce to be a light-hearted moment

72
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,280
but I kind of realized said hey comments

73
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,020
are a really really serious topic and I

74
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,520
know a lot of youtubers including myself

75
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,540
all the time like to pretend like they

76
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,590
don't really get to us and that we're

77
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:51,590
above them and that were just happy

78
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:53,480
positive people but in reality they do

79
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:54,950
get to us sometimes and they've really

80
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,750
shaped me to be Who I am today and both

81
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:58,490
a good way and unfortunately bad ways

82
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:00,380
too but it is really important to focus

83
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:01,729
on the love and positivity because of

84
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:03,830
you guys I've really been able to be the

85
00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:04,970
person I am today and your comments have

86
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:07,040
been able to keep me positive if they're

87
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:08,990
really really really dark times all

88
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,460
these comments are very very real and

89
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:12,770
these are words and phrases and things

90
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:14,210
that I have to read every single day on

91
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,979
content that I am really really proud of

92
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:17,419
and work really really hard at and I

93
00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:19,550
know it may seem like being youtubers

94
00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:21,050
such an easy job but if you really strip

95
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:22,880
everything away we're just kids sitting

96
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:24,470
behind a camera and trying our best make

97
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,750
other people happy and to keep ourselves

98
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:27,919
inspired and at the end of the day it's

99
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:30,020
so much easier to just spread love and

100
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,880
positivity and not be me and I urge you

101
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:33,200
guys every single day to do the same

102
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,520

really hope you enjoyed it

174
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:34,940
I know it was a little bit of a

175
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:37,430
different one and a shorter one and kind

176
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:39,830
of a very drastic twist on a current

177
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:40,849
YouTube trend but it really meant a lot

178
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:42,080
to me and everything that I was saying

179
00:07:40,849 --> 00:07:44,060

180
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,380
how cheesy it was and I just want you

181
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,210

00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:51,949
although there's a lot of hate your

185
00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:54,199
guys's love always speaks louder and I'm

186
