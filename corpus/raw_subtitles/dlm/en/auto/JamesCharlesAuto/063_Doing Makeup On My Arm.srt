00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,419
hi sisters James Charles here and

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:04,830
welcome back to my youtube channel you

3
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:05,850
guys I am very very excited for today's

4
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,849
video because we're doing a challenge

5
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:10,230
that I really never thought I'd be doing

6
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:11,700
now you guys know as an artist I'm

7
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,469
always looking for new people and it

8
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,389
comes to follow to keep me inspired and

9
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:16,859
wanting to create now to my all-time

10
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:18,690
favorite pages to follow on Instagram

11
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,300
are by the usernames shine and shadows

12
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,460
and Gabrielle with access now their work

13
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,140
are both so beyond incredible I've

14
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,330
gotten so much inspiration from them and

15
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,529
have recreated many looks on my page but

16
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,609
there's just something a little bit

17
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:31,410
different about both of their makeup

18
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:34,230
looks and that is that most of them are

19
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,730
on their arms now I'm not gonna lie when

20
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,260
I first saw these arm looks I was a

21
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,399
little bit confused and the first

22
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,800
thought that went through my head was oh

23
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,750
my god what youtuber is really

24
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,129
struggling for ideas now but when I

25
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,750
thought about a little bit further if

26
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:47,219
the exact same thing is doing a face

27
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,719
chart which is basically practicing a

28
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:50,370
makeup book on a piece of paper before

29
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,460
doing on your face but this name is just

30
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:55,230
on your arm it's done I honestly have no

31
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,460
idea how I'm going to do in this

32
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,899
challenge today as many of you guys know

33
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,210
when I was younger I used to draw and

34
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:01,350
paint portraits all the time so I'm

35
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,000
pretty familiar with being able to

36
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,320
recreate the human face and I also do

37
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,270
makeup pretty much every single day as

38
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,770
well and I like to think that I'm

39
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:10,350
relatively good at it so combining the

40
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:12,960
two could be easy but these artists are

41
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:14,580
also insanely insanely talented and

42
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,710
create the most beautiful colorful

43
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,990
glittery or blended makeup looks so this

44
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:20,580
could be a major major fail but

45
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,960
regardless I am so excited it's your

46
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,320
head the sound today and without further

47
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:30,170
ado let's get started

48
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:32,190

49
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:33,720

my full face of makeup is already on and

52
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:39,240

53
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,670

55
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,830

arm up just to even out all the skin and

59
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,160

find that things about this I will go

67
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,280
ahead and say it and this is not even

68
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,690
part of the sponsorship if this is the

69
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,460
only one of the best color matches I've

70
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:09,780
ever had regardless of the sponsorship

71
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,280
I'm gonna be reaching for this a whole

72
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,780
lot more so y'all stop drawing me but

73
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,490
let me tell you because actually is a

74
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,410
really mom foundation to the brand new

75
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:18,360
Revlon Photoready canon foundation comes

76
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:20,070
in 31 different shades of a medium

77
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,530
buildable coverage natural finish

78
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:24,150
formula it includes antioxidants and

79
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:26,820
anti blue light ingredients infuses

80
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:28,230
vitamin E and also is anti pollutant as

81
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,940
well which means it basically keeps out

82
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,709
all the disgusting crusted bus and stuff

83
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,360
that's floating around in the air kind

84
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:35,340
of good wearing it on my face and blend

85
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,350
it out so easily and I will say feels

86
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,180
extremely late on the skin as well and

87
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:40,470
it also provides coverage while still

88
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,450
letting your natural beauty like my

89
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:46,170
freckles shine it through and best thing

90
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:47,820
of all it only retails for 1099 so good

91
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:48,930
so crushed you guys don't have to check

92
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:51,330
it out and thank you once again to

93
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,950
Revlon for working me on today's video

94
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:54,570
alright so since this is the first time

95
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:56,220
of me literally ever try this out I

96
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:57,750
think for my first look I want to start

97
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,430
off with something easy know if it goes

98
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:01,980
well I will definitely do another one a

99
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:03,060
but I want to do this look from my a

100
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:05,160
paint-by-numbers

101
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,750
photo obviously not the whole numbers

102
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,519
and white part but like the actual glam

103
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,590
that I had on and this one I is really

104
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:12,450
really pretty and I think I could kind

105
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:16,230
of do an okay job of putting that on my

106
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:18,239
arm maybe let's try it so I think I want

107
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:20,040
to start doing my eyes in the same order

108
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,390
that I would doing normal I look sad

109
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,250
which is starting off with my eyebrows

110
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:24,570
this could be a major major mistake

111
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,739
because if the eyebrows aren't looking

112
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:27,450
good the entire look is already

113
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:28,880
cancelled but that's good because it

114
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:32,280
means we get to keep doing the challenge

115
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:34,680
until it works that's not good

116
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,420
looks like my literal worst nightmare

117
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,850
I'm gonna grab my Anasazi at number 12

118
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:40,170
brushing my Anasazi at dipbrow pomade so

119
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,760
looking at this photo of my eyebrows

120
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,810
definitely like the biggest thing

121
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,970
shocker

122
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:46,980
my eyebrow and inner corner pretty much

123
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:49,110
ended the same place but the tail and

124
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:51,030
that eyeball do not let me turn off like

125
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:53,430
up here my eyebrows go up at a pretty

126
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,840
soft angle and then it kind of goes

127
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:57,690
straight out I'm going to incorporate

128
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,860
this freckle and two into my brow so it

129
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,660
doesn't show at the end

130
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:02,340
okay eyebrows are pretty thick as well

131
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,959
let's be real like I said this is the

132
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,090
first try it's okay if it's not perfect

133
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:08,640
if I pull this this way I can they kind

134
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:10,500
of blend out the dipbrow my brother

135
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,780
definitely thick all the way through but

136
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,730
they do have like a somewhat bit of

137
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,350
ombre from like very very filled in and

138
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:22,410
the tail to a little bit more sparse and

139
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:23,580
like hairy and airy in the front of the

140
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:25,020
brow so I want to try to recreate that

141
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,360
same look today I'm just setting that

142
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:29,790
different place using tea from my

143
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,360
palette then it's blending that shade in

144
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:35,790
towards the front a little ombre moment

145
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,310
I guess like another angle brush now and

146
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:40,860
another dark brown shade I'll grab Benny

147
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:42,630
and T from my palette I'll use this to

148
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:44,729
like sketch in actual hairs I'm not

149
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:45,870
gonna go outside of my brow lines as

150
00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:47,700
well because I definitely took rush my

151
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:52,110
brow hairs upwards so they're nice and

152
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:53,490
textured kind of good okay okay now I

153
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:56,039
need to do that again I think mine are

154
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:57,450
much thicker than what I made this we're

155
00:04:56,039 --> 00:04:59,190
just gonna do it in my head my brows

156
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:01,200
look like which is a lot thinner and

157
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:05,340
prettier than what they really are okay

158
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:09,840
more dip brow mmm okay this needs to be

159
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:11,430
art or whatever more straight words so

160
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,919
I'm actually going to interrupt this

161
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:15,090
freckle right here who loved that I

162
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,560
think my freckles knew I was filming

163
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:18,360
this video I just wanted to really align

164
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,890
themselves so I could draw my eyebrows

165
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,810
in the right place so thank you for that

166
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:23,430
try just filling this and now saying is

167
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:25,950
nothing that I did beforehand except now

168
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:27,750
we're doing it backwards blending in

169
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:29,850
some of those hairs using a tea from the

170
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:32,580
pallet once again just to fit a more

171
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:36,200
like ombre shadow brow color and then

172
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:36,200
using a tea and Benny

173
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,490
we already the sounds that this is our

174
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:45,560
practice so I'm going to not worry about

175
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:48,050
the shape too much wow this looks so

176
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,970
awful I'm scared so grabbing a little

177
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:51,590
bit of concealer on why you same angle

178
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:54,530
brush leaves to cut my brows I'm just

179
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:56,600
going to cut my brows just going in very

180
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:58,610
very carefully with the excess concealer

181
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,830
then just patting it into a place so we

182
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:02,090
can use it as an eyeshadow base no doing

183
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,620
the other brow as well these are

184
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:05,240
definitely not even I already know that

185
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:07,970
for a fact I'm thinking maybe I should

186
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,530
like add in my nose contour now just

187
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:11,720
gonna got my regular anastacio contour

188
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:13,640
kit and my angled brush from Maya James

189
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,530
Charles brush set and then just contour

190
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,120
it and this looks awful for some reason

191
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:19,580
this contour powder it's creating like a

192
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,050
grey tone over top of my concealer which

193
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:23,000
has literally never happened before

194
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:24,650
considering I use this combination all

195
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
the time which is really annoying that

196
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:27,440
this is not happening on my arm where

197
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,940
I'm trying to create a look but to work

198
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,590
just going to ignore it for now and

199
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:33,020
hopefully it fixes itself later I think

200
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:35,540
I need to put in my like I liked lash

201
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:36,800
line first so I know where everything

202
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,970
else is supposed to go and it's pretty

203
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,330
much just a straight line all the way

204
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:43,010
across so if that's my lash line

205
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:45,410
okay now same thing on the other arm oh

206
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:46,640
god what's this eyeballs looking wonky

207
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:48,530
we're gonna leave it at that for right

208
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:51,530
now I think I just do when I said on the

209
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:53,840
normal order yeah okay so I'm gonna grab

210
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:55,820
an hour 39 brush and start off with a

211
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,530
little bit of code James and put that in

212
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,910
the crease actually packing it on there

213
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:00,560
and then blending it out just like we do

214
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:01,880
it on normal or so techniques and just

215
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,980
furthering out the edges onto that

216
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,990
concealer so it looks nice and even yeah

217
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:07,520
gorgeous bring it into the inner corner

218
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,720
as well but kind of fading it out

219
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,310
because we have that glitter going on

220
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,740
there later of course feeding it into

221
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:14,300
the nose contour a little bit just like

222
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,080
I always do same thing on the other side

223
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,580
as well

224
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,850
I hate you my cardio bracelets are in

225
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:21,320
the way of me being able to blend I

226
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:23,060
absolutely hated that Louis cut that out

227
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,430
now with an anima for fights to Express

228
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:28,460
I'm gonna dip into 10% off which is the

229
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:31,400
darker brown and uses to add some like

230
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:33,260
contour into the crease that doesn't

231
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,800
even exist in these before bringing it

232
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,080
in

233
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,910
and blending it up and just like before

234
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,919
pulling the shade it pretty far out as

235
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:41,840
well other side to match he's a little

236
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,970
bit of no beans to add even more depth

237
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,379
with that same em four five six brush

238
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:48,349
and just keeping those kind of more on

239
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:52,069
the outer third or the outer two-thirds

240
00:07:48,349 --> 00:07:54,319
rather of the crease now I am going to

241
00:07:52,069 --> 00:07:56,599
start sketching out my block winged

242
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,729
liner using a little brush and some

243
00:07:56,599 --> 00:08:00,590
spooky from the palette and once you

244
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:02,840
buff this into the lash line that we

245
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:05,300
drew in earlier starting off thin and

246
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,400
then going right upwards and pulling it

247
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:09,650
right up and then buffing this block

248
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,569
into the crease for some out of

249
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:14,360
dimension just using this Stila liquid

250
00:08:11,569 --> 00:08:23,800
metals to cut my crease to a nice little

251
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:27,069
round shape Oh still bad yes oh hello oh

252
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,069
there's one right here

253
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:39,500
well what do we do now let me add in

254
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,539
some more black because they can really

255
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,039
fix a lot of problems this is not

256
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:48,010
staying block as I wanted it to be

257
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:50,990
that's decent looking okay yeah okay I

258
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:54,860
know it's not grabbing a little bit of a

259
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:58,370
face and ring light with a little spritz

260
00:08:54,860 --> 00:09:00,079
of some setting spray mama I'm going to

261
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:01,250
pump it in the inner corner a little bit

262
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:02,660
on the brow bone too

263
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,670
now I'm going to create my little lower

264
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:05,959
lash line well it's gonna get covered

265
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:08,329
off but I need to put it there anyway

266
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:10,760
okay so we're gonna put some same cards

267
00:09:08,329 --> 00:09:12,740
we use below the lash line and then

268
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:15,829
using a little bit of both coaches and

269
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:19,250
10% off to blend those shades out oh not

270
00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:21,050
awful bad but not awful now have it on

271
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:24,230
that eyelashes which is where this could

272
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:27,459
get really bad really really fast oh my

273
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,459
god okay

274
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:33,920
okay hey I'm going to do this again the

275
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:38,300

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:43,130
no don't go sin no no there's only one

277
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:44,779
eye for me how are we on this level

00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:46,880
delusion and we're only 30 minutes into

279
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:48,139

281
00:09:48,139 --> 00:09:57,500
second eye

282
00:09:50,390 --> 00:10:01,460
[Music]

283
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,880
I think I'm done I'm scared to look at

284
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,170
it

285
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,820
this is my first time ever doing this at

286
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:06,050
least I gave the precursor am I already

287
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,580
planning on doing a second look at this

288
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:11,410
one fails so let's give the Green

289
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:11,410
revealed see what we got going on Oh

290
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:19,310
oh my god why how did the eyeballs end

291
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:20,390
up like that so looking at both eyes and

292
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:23,150
both brows

293
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:26,780
they both look actually really really

294
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:27,980
good but they're just not even like it's

295
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:34,700
like a like this and pull the skin down

296
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:37,700
already looks a lot oh this is so hard

297
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:53,500
oh you know what I want to do Oh scary

298
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:53,500
see well imagine this is a thumbnail I

299
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:58,289
[Applause]

300
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,289
[Music]

301
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:11,690
have to photoshop that all right you

302
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:13,910
guys let's be honest with each other

303
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:16,430
here our first attempt at our arm Fisher

304
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:17,480
is definitely a major fail I think is

305
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:18,800
actually the first time we've done a

306
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:22,040
makeup challenge on this channel and

307
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:24,410
it's been like a major major major awful

308
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,580
failure but we do not take no for an

309
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:27,500
answer we don't like to fail and we

310
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:29,450
never back down from a challenge so I

311
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,680
really want to try this again and take

312
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:32,810
what I learned this one runs in the

313
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:35,210
Pyatt next time which is of course that

314
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:38,390
my arm is round so I need to try really

315
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:39,320
hard to make these like even I doesn't

316
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:41,150
want to pay attention to the fact that

317
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:43,400
one closer to my wrist should be up and

318
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:45,200
the one closer to my elbow should be a

319
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:47,540
little bit more down just to offset the

320
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,190
like scan it movement I'm gonna go ahead

321
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,840
and wipe this off and I'll be right back

322
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:55,250
to try it look number two

323
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:56,930
so for this next look I am deciding to

324
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:59,330
challenge myself which is a brave

325
00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:00,770
decision considering the first one was

326
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:02,210
already challenged and did not go well

327
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:03,500
but you know what I looked at some of

328
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:05,000
the videos that Gabrielle and shine

329
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,410
shadows had posted on their Instagram

330
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,550
accounts and I noticed on all of their

331
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:09,350
videos they started off with the

332
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:11,630
eyebrows and like eyeballs already kind

333
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:12,980
of like pre sketched out so they had

334
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:15,590
like a rough idea of where to put things

335
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:17,720
which hello like I don't know why I

336
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:19,310
didn't think about to begin with so for

337
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,960
this second look I picked out this photo

338
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:23,630
that I posted on my Instagram literally

339
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,950
over a year ago I actually did a look on

340
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:26,660
this I think this is in my coming-out

341
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:27,980
story video this is literally what my

342
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:29,840
favorite looks I've ever created in my

343
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:31,370
like entire makeup career I think it is

344
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,530
so stunning

345
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:37,310
so I want to try to recreate like this

346
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:38,540
exact like eye area on my arm including

347
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:41,270
the eyes at the different angle and the

348
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:43,280
eyes being open so this might mess me up

349
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:45,950
even more than the first time around

350
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:47,330
but at least I can say that I tried and

351
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:48,890
if I get this it'll be really cool and

352
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:51,350
fun in front of so let's just jump right

353
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:53,180
in again let me grab my Nastasia brow

354
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:56,030
pencil in the shade soft brow which is a

355
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:58,430
nice erasable color I'm gonna draw my

356
00:12:56,030 --> 00:13:00,320
eyeball right here actually me to put in

357
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:02,360
my eyebrows for our still that is a good

358
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,180
brow okay I'm happy with that eyebrow

359
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:12,950
that means my eyeball would be right

360
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:14,300
about here to draw and buckles and

361
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:16,460
beauty marks are literally landing and

362
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:18,920
they're perfect places and then okay so

363
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:21,320
if my brows here I have to imagine like

364
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:23,330
my nose bridge is coming down right here

365
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,340
so like my contour is gonna be I'm gonna

366
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:29,960
put my contour here I know that actually

367
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:32,090
Bulger's is gonna be like here oh my

368
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:34,280
body is meant for this so this means

369
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:36,140
this line goes right up about here and

370
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,640
the curves end and there's the shadow in

371
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:39,170
here you actually got lost but way too

372
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:41,690
close when those we're just gonna be

373
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:44,570
here the shadow going this way that

374
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:46,430
means the brow is gonna go right here at

375
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:48,830
the same angle and is gonna stop right

376
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:50,690
there cuz she's thick but she gets cut

377
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:52,230
off so then my eyeball goes down right

378
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:56,100
here so I will number two

379
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:58,800
is here and goes this okay like that and

380
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:01,070
then my left eyebrow does tend to droop

381
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,600
down a little bit in photos which is

382
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:05,910
she's drooping here about us for sure

383
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,320
now that I hope the rough draft kind of

384
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:09,750
sketched out it's looking okay not gonna

385
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,250
lie I'm going to fill in the eyes first

386
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,810
which is what Gabrielle did on all of

387
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,580
her videos so I'm going to grab the

388
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:17,040
Jeffrey Stehr armor druglord liquid

389
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:19,020
lipstick and use this to fill them in

390
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,810
set this down with some flash back from

391
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:23,400
the palette let's draw in some nice

392
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:25,170
eyeballs okay now I'm gonna shade this

393
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:27,540
in a little bit okay that is a good

394
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:30,570
eyeball if I ever did see one truly

395
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:32,850
adding in tiny little lines for our

396
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:34,590
details that is a good eyeball look at

397
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:36,660
that that is so professional and famous

398
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:38,940
I mean so this one is going like right

399
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:43,140
here now it's time to fill in the

400
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:45,000
eyebrow oh okay I'm just using team from

401
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:46,350
the palette and putting in same thing

402
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,400
like the day brought before but into the

403
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:49,710
tail and I'm just going to use the

404
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:53,310
excess and blend it forward at this time

405
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:55,950
not being at so intense and softer and

406
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:58,770
less scary okay how did that still get

407
00:14:55,950 --> 00:15:00,690
dark that's a good that's good that's a

408
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:04,820
good eye brow I'm really happy with that

409
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:04,820
now I'm going to card out the brow what

410
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:13,560
some concealer underneath that eyeball

411
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:15,120
tail just because we will push out of

412
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,500
there in a little bit this is already

413
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,290
turning out way better than the first

414
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:20,910
time I am first going to grab a pencil

415
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:23,520
brush that is stained with a little bit

416
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:25,620
of purple and dip in to escape from the

417
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:28,380
palette and I'm going to use this to

418
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:30,690
build our outer V of the eye and that's

419
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:32,820
too big I'm not this whole life I'm

420
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:34,590
gonna grab this Sigma e 21 brush instead

421
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:36,390
boosting I run it to about here and then

422
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:37,890
really brought it up nicely to about

423
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:40,290
right there it almost think I had some

424
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:42,210
more escape right into here this is

425
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:44,010
actually before the palette was even a

426
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:45,780
things I don't even know why using this

427
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:48,390
original video probably the 35 be

428
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:48,960
alright pecan but forgotten the purple

429
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:50,340
also Wow

430
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,310
below my lash line so I'm gonna bring

431
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:53,050
that

432
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:54,460
well leaving a tiny little gap for that

433
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:56,050
light blue liner that we'll put in later

434
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:58,870
in this vision oh look I also do

435
00:15:56,050 --> 00:16:00,820
remember that I did a purple liner so

436
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:02,529
I'm going to throw that on now before

437
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,700
the rest of the look comes on just so I

438
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:05,560
can kind of keep it in place

439
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:09,040
ninety to blend that out with a little

440
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:11,589
bit but love that with a pencil brush

441
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,029
and blend over the edges carefully then

442
00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:15,070
I'm gonna use a little bit of it you're

443
00:16:13,029 --> 00:16:16,270
cutting the bright red and that same

444
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:20,290
brush I guess we're just sticking with

445
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:21,730
this one honestly love that letting it

446
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:23,740
together no need to bring it a little

447
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:26,230
bit more single because it got a little

448
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:28,630
bit lost in the blending process now we

449
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:31,390
go a little bit of an M four five six

450
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:34,540
and dip into five one eight and blend

451
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:36,010
out this top edge I wanna clean just the

452
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:37,089
ads up with concealer just to come on

453
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:38,710
the original luck it is a little bit

454
00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:40,810
more like pointed so but I kind of like

455
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:42,700
just loosely hold a thin it might kind

456
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:45,520
of shape it a little bit more - oh yes

457
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:47,680
that looks so good and also

458
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:49,600
simultaneously fresh okay great I'm

459
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,630
really happy right now okay so now I'm

460
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,580
going to Rob hello-hello from my palette

461
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:58,600
and a little pocket rush and we're going

462
00:16:54,580 --> 00:17:00,040
to use this shade to cut my crease I'm

463
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:03,490
going to overlay this right over top of

464
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:04,839
the purple oops oh I don't want to get

465
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:06,310
on there just like when I did the

466
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:07,689
original look I'm going to make sure to

467
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:09,910
bring out this color all the way into

468
00:17:07,689 --> 00:17:12,010
that inner corner and this cut crease

469
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:13,959
actually went far above the crease which

470
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:15,610
is really really cool this is more of

471
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:18,670
like a messy stuff a crease and I got

472
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:20,650
really love how it turned out so it's

473
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:22,449
going to bring that into there to grab a

474
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:23,620
little bit of acappella with that same

475
00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:25,660
brush and use this to kind of blend

476
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:27,370
together the blue in the purple we use

477
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:28,840
this to lightly blend oh the edge can

478
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:31,270
also have a little bit of this hello

479
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:34,170
right on that inner corner and bring it

480
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:34,170
onto the lash line

481
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:40,710
but it gonna be a little bit of Betty on

482
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:42,870
a tiny little brush this is the M of 515

483
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:45,990
like hell out look at this and I'm gonna

484
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:48,480
use this to add some black very little

485
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:52,260
bit of block just that steady a little

486
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,580
bit to the army I've been here my

487
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,990
jeffree star cosmetics liquid lipstick

488
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:57,000
in the shade a jawbreaker and this is

489
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:58,140
from the brand new blue blood collection

490
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,460
well it's not actually this one's been

491
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,600
around for a while but it just realized

492
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:02,400
with the blue bonnet collection which I

493
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,320
was so excited about and proud enough

494
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,510
sister Jeffrey I believe it's sold out

495
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:09,450
by the time of this video is up so I

496
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:11,790
mean go get it but like good luck I'm

497
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:14,910
going to use this a tiny little liner

498
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:17,070
brush to lie to my lower waterline and

499
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:18,960
then adding in a tiny little bit of drug

500
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:20,220
lord in there just to look make it look

501
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,300
like it's like kind of wet then I'm

502
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:26,130
gonna grab a little bit of the Mac

503
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:27,690
reflex teal and add this on top then

504
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:29,610
just using a tiny little bit of glitter

505
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:31,290
adhesive I'm going to pop on a few

506
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:33,000
little chunky glitters gonna use a

507
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:34,290
little bit more of a ring lay on a tiny

508
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,090
little brush once again and highlight

509
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:38,190
the brow bone now I think it's time to

510
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:41,310
draw on the lashes so now I hope to draw

511
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:42,840
in my eyeliner thank God that was

512
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:44,820
literally this bullseye night ever I've

513
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,470
ever diddly done did ja know what's got

514
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:48,510
you in the lashes going very very slowly

515
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:50,430
toward them look a little close at first

516
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:51,840
for the bottom lash line did add a

517
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:53,970
little individual so I'm gonna add in a

518
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:57,750
little spiky right here and some more

519
00:18:53,970 --> 00:19:00,690
little Spanky's that is literally so

520
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:02,430
good oh my gosh you guys okay I think

521
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:05,490
that is officially one out of my two

522
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:07,350
eyes complete which was the far harder

523
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:10,110
one I am going to now do the other one

524
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:11,360
quickly and the challenge will finally

525
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:24,970
be complete

526
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:24,970
[Music]

527
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:32,700
oh my gosh you guys literally five hours

528
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:34,710
later I was so convinced this is going

529
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:38,340
to be an easy video to film and I of

530
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:39,809
course was wrong but finally my second

531
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:43,249
eye look is complete and I'm actually

532
00:19:39,809 --> 00:19:48,960
very very happy with it

533
00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:50,460
beautiful Wow look at that artistry I

534
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,590
went into the shell ecstatic not really

535
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:55,470
knowing what to expect and this was way

536
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:56,759
way harder than anticipated oh my god I

537
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:59,009
really thought this is gonna be a quick

538
00:19:56,759 --> 00:20:00,359
little one-and-done video no absolutely

539
00:19:59,009 --> 00:20:01,830
not but that is of course because you

540
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:05,070
guys know I never like to give up on

541
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:06,899
anything I will probably openly and

542
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:09,090
honestly say this is like the worst

543
00:20:06,899 --> 00:20:10,200
we've done a challenge so far I really

544
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:11,369
get a lot of our challenge videos I

545
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,480
usually start off really really scared

546
00:20:11,369 --> 00:20:16,830
and then it somehow it turns out pretty

547
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:18,600
good at the end it's okay I mean looking

548
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:20,369
at this like it's okay it definitely

549
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,779
could be a whole lot worse I think we

550
00:20:20,369 --> 00:20:23,700
definitely learned a lot today this is

551
00:20:21,779 --> 00:20:25,830
great practice but I think ever wanna be

552
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,419
on a level even close to Gabrielle or

553
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:29,009
shine shadows I'm gonna probably have to

554
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:30,809
do this on my arm a million more times

555
00:20:29,009 --> 00:20:32,850
so it seems like for now I'm just gonna

556
00:20:30,809 --> 00:20:34,830
stick to my normal I shadow on my actual

557
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:36,239
