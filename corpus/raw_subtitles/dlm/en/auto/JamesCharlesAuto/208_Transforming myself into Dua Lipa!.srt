00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,959
hi sisters James Charles here and

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,549
welcome back to my youtube channel in

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:06,990
today's video I'm going to be finally

4
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:08,460
addressing and talking about something

5
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,710
that you guys have been asking me about

6
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,790
for years now I've avoided this topic

7
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,500
completely if that I have gotten

8
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,790
thousands of comments there have been

9
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,350
news articles written about it and there

10
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,140
have been countless tweets that ago on a

11
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,369
ridiculously viral with hundreds and

12
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:23,699
thousands of different likes on them all

13
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:25,650
asking James are you Julie pav

14
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:28,140
now I will say the public is never

15
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:30,240
actually seen it myself and du liebe in

16
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,430
the same place at the same time so you

17
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,020
can form your own opinions but we have

18
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:38,129
seen a lot of Dooley pose iconic musical

19
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:40,820
moments and you think we've also seen

20
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:42,870
some of my less iconic musical moments

21
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:45,780
so I think it is safe to say

22
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:47,700
unfortunately I'm not do a lip balm but

23
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,559
that being sad I've seen your tweets

24
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,090
I've seen your posts sometimes I just

25
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:54,300
don't see it but there's other times

26
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:56,070
where I'm like oh my gosh we look so so

27
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,480
similar so for today's video I thought

28
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:59,100
it'd be super fun to transcend that I've

29
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,359
never actually done before on my youtube

30
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,300
channel and that is a celebrity

31
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:05,390
transformation in to do a Lipa let's get

32
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,560
started

33
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:08,560
[Music]

34
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,300
okay you guys I am so excited for the

35
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:16,130
transformation at today at du liebe is

36
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,780
by far my favorite pop stars right now

37
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:19,400
her music is so good she just keeps

38
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,180
releasing a bomb after bomb after bomb

39
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,010
after bomb

40
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,420
I also think she is it so stunning it

41
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:24,860
starting off I popped on this a fun

42
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,360
little green turtleneck because she

43
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:28,340
wears a lot of a bright colors and I

44
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,410
also popped on up my darker brown

45
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,790
contacts because she has super dark eyes

46
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:33,200
the first step we're going to do before

47
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:34,940
actually applying any makeup is

48
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,380
something super fine that but I'm also a

49
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:38,540
little bit nervous about and that is

50
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,860
face tapes if you don't know what these

51
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:41,690
are these are a super like

52
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:42,860
behind-the-scenes about a beauty Hawk

53
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:44,720
that are used in a lot of Hollywood

54
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:46,580
movies and on set all the time they are

55
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,260
a tiny little plastic sheet and you

56
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,700
stick it to your face and then used it

57
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:52,250
the other one to the other side and you

58
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:54,650
pull and it gives you a super snatch

59
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:56,060
look so I thought this would be good for

60
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,620
today transformation it because do it

61
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:00,230
does have a little bit more of a pull to

62
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:01,400
I than I do what I love the look of so

63
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,810
we're gonna try this up for the first

64
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,400
time I actually watched on my favorite

65
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:06,080
makeup artist makeup by her roots to an

66
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,480
entire video on these so I'm going to a

67
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,860
try my best to apply these today but if

68
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,660
you guys want to check these up for

69
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:34,370
yourself check out her brushes video so

70
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:36,080
I definitely want a little facelift so

71
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:42,200
this whole thing will stick better now

72
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:45,140
oh my god this one looks a little long

73
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:47,150
that's one notch loser tell us about her

74
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:48,980
okay cool I know these face tapes look

75
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:50,390
absolutely insane right now but don't

76
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,800
worry it the makeup will go on over top

77
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:53,330
of them and they won't be noticeable and

78
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,890
then once the wig goes on if you'll even

79
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:56,510
see them at all these are not for

80
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:58,400
everyday use although if you want to be

81
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,930
stash off the time be my guest

82
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,430
I think this looks super cool but it's

83
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,840
now time to do all the makeup on top

84
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:04,370
before doing this video today I left

85
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,570
through to his entire Instagram page cuz

86
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:06,040
I really want to emulate her makeup

87
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:07,719
style

88
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,860
best way that I possibly can and the one

89
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:10,239
thing that I noticed is that she does

90
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,310
always do I find that pop of color on

91
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,379
the eyes but for the base it's honestly

92
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:15,340
like kind of natural she does always

93
00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:16,689
have like a little bit of a medium

94
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,310
coverage foundation a little bit of

95
00:03:16,689 --> 00:03:19,900
blush a little bit of glow but there's

96
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:21,400
never too much contour never too much

97
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,170
under-eye brightening it's like kind of

98
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,879
even which is definitely very different

99
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,560
for my typical makeup style but I

100
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,329
definitely wanna emulate that today so

101
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,280
I'm gonna grab the Effendi Beauty at Pro

102
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:32,319
feltzer hydrating it foundation who

103
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,389
actually I do want to color cut a tiny

104
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:41,799
bit first just because duly put is in

105
00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:44,980
fact a woman and I'm not and and a 3 and

106
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:46,150
a 4 o'clock a 645 shadow as well now I'm

107
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,829
gonna go in that foundation and to start

108
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:49,930
buffing it into the skin I'm actually

109
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:51,250
gonna add it just a little bit of at the

110
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:53,379
pro filter foundation in the shade at

111
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:55,329
210 which I know is a little bit darker

112
00:03:53,379 --> 00:03:56,709
than my natural skin tone I did say the

113
00:03:55,329 --> 00:03:58,870
20/20 is gonna be the year I'm matching

114
00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:00,099
my foundation but I do want to make this

115
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:01,689
transformation as accurate as possible

116
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:03,280
and I feel like do it it's a little bit

117
00:04:01,689 --> 00:04:04,689
more tan and than I am so I wanna make

118
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,040
sure that that is reflected for

119
00:04:04,689 --> 00:04:07,659
concealer today as always I'm just gonna

120
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,769
use my Tarte shape tape but I'm only

121
00:04:07,659 --> 00:04:11,169
gonna put a little bit of this

122
00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:13,540
underneath my eyes where I have some

123
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:15,250
slight discoloration a little bit on or

124
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,810
a lot a bit on my beard area and then

125
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:19,389
the center of the forehead and then I'm

126
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:20,859
also going to use my brush to above and

127
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:22,780
now before I go in and set this all in

128
00:04:20,859 --> 00:04:24,729
place a powder for a bronzer today I'm

129
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:29,110
actually gonna grab a cream bronzer just

130
00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:30,849
this la 10 so gosh it's too late hon

131
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:32,229
Deschanel and I'm gonna put this on in

132
00:04:30,849 --> 00:04:33,849
the same type of like a shapes that I

133
00:04:32,229 --> 00:04:35,740
normally do because the one thing that

134
00:04:33,849 --> 00:04:37,240
is super similar about us is our facial

135
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:39,010
structure oh my god you literally can't

136
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,990
even see the face tapes on camera whoa

137
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:42,669
and then just using a flat brush this

138
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,990
one is I don't know the label is robbed

139
00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:46,840
off of it I'm just gonna grab some alarm

140
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:49,599
RCA translucent setting powder and cut

141
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:51,460
this so for contour today it's always in

142
00:04:49,599 --> 00:04:53,880
this figure my Anasazi a contour kit and

143
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:56,440
I am 405 bucks but I'm going to

144
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:58,240
literally use like none of this I just

145
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,400
want to kind of reinforce a little bit

146
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,870
about bronzer that I put on it almost

147
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,780
looks like she has like a little bit of

148
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:06,880
like wander on her chin Darry even say

149
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:10,449
like at least in a lot of these photos

150
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:12,669
it does oh now this nose contour I'm

151
00:05:10,449 --> 00:05:15,340
scared about because dewa doesn't

152
00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:16,000
actually contour her nose like at all

153
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,960
and

154
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,730
but he's been watching my channel for

155
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,230
more than approximately three minutes

156
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:22,390
you would know that nose contour is

157
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:24,400
pretty much like the most vital step to

158
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:27,430
my makeup routine I love a pinched and

159
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,930
snatched nose but I'm not getting that

160
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:31,530
in today's video she definitely has a

161
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:34,570
much more like almost like triangular

162
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:36,790
squared off nose tip whereas mine is

163
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:38,590
very round and bulbous so although she

164
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:41,350
doesn't know contour I am gonna try to

165
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:42,850
add some of those shadows in to make my

166
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:45,100
nose shape look a little bit more like

167
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:46,840
hers so I'm going to grab some of that

168
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:50,020
powder and I'm going to run that along

169
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:53,050
the bottom edge of my nose okay that's

170
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:55,300
like it was crazy okay that's like

171
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:57,820
exactly it though I'm also gonna grab a

172
00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:00,370
little bit of that darker powder and I'm

173
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:03,730
gonna make two dots like right above my

174
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:05,230
nostril she has a shadow here in her

175
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:07,330
nose before I jump into anything else

176
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:08,590
I'm gonna finish up the base so for

177
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:10,360
highlighter today I'm gonna grab at the

178
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:12,550
morphe dimension a stick in the shade

179
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,320
effect one I don't remember what video

180
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:16,300
ideas is then but I have been using this

181
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:18,640
so much since then it is such a good a

182
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:20,950
cream highlighting formula so I'm just

183
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,750
going to I never start drawing this on

184
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:24,430
and do it definitely likes a lot of

185
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:26,590
highlight in the center of her forehead

186
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:28,930
which I've got a respect to it okay and

187
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:30,880
then for nose highlight once again it's

188
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,770
very square so I'm gonna draw in like a

189
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,320
kind of straight line across the top of

190
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:37,030
my nose now the one thing that do a does

191
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,380
like use a lot of in her looks is blush

192
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:40,270
and you guys know I have been obsessed a

193
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,620
blush recently this one is the brand new

194
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,970
Kylie cosmetics blush in the shade of

195
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:44,560
pink dreams that this color is a

196
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:47,560
stunning so I'm going to apply this

197
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,240
using my morphe X chocolate Hill @jh o-6

198
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,370
brush and I'm just going to put that

199
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,300
right over top now we get to move on to

200
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,710
the part of the look that I have been

201
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,479
looking forward to since the beginning

202
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:58,270
of this video and that is do as eyebrows

203
00:06:55,479 --> 00:07:00,729
she has super super bushy unruly brows

204
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:02,320
which I love so so so much and so my

205
00:07:00,729 --> 00:07:03,880
favorite brow sales to do obviously I

206
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,020
have very very thick brows myself so

207
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,300
this shouldn't be too hard to achieve

208
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,650
but I do want to add at some hairs and

209
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,270
make sure that they are nice and shaped

210
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:13,060
so I'm first angle and with just a clear

211
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:14,590
brow gel to brush the hairs upwards it's

212
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:16,150
so I kind of know like what direction

213
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:17,740
they're gonna go in for this lift today

214
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:19,810
I'm gonna grab my Urban Decay a brow

215
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:21,729
blade in the shade dark drapes because

216
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:24,310
that this product is actually do ended

217
00:07:21,729 --> 00:07:25,849
and one end has a super super tiny and

218
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:29,479
sharp brown marker

219
00:07:25,849 --> 00:07:30,979
to do I'll and that I'm not adding in

220
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:33,649
tiny little lines to make sure the brow

221
00:07:30,979 --> 00:07:35,389
is defined but by doing it this way I'm

222
00:07:33,649 --> 00:07:38,050
getting that bushy look without it being

223
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:41,479
super super structure that looks so good

224
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:44,059
20 square face keeps like always

225
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:45,199

288
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:54,480

mascara which I love unfortunately for

290
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,140
me after years and years of wearing

291
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:00,510
falsies and ripping them out with glue I

292
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:02,160

297
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:10,470
