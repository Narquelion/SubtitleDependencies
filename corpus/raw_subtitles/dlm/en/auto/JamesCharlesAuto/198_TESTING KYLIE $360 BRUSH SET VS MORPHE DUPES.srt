00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,720
hi sisters James Charles here and

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,190
welcome back to my youtube channel for

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,779
today's video I have something very very

4
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,300
special plan that I actually don't do

5
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:10,679
very often and that is a review I really

6
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,880
don't do reviews that often mostly

7
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:13,139
because I have my favorite products that

8
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,509
I like to stick to an every single

9
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:18,270
makeup look but also when it comes to

10
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:19,740
reviews people love love love to share

11
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,480
their opinions and if you love a product

12
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,100
you're eating somebody's ass or you're

13
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,900
being paid to do so and if you hate a

14
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,820
product you're jealous you're angry

15
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,039
because you're not on a PR list or who

16
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,449
freaking knows every time I do a review

17
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,610
and I read the comment I could just feel

18
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:34,860
the brain cells being sucked right out

19
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:37,590
of my head but when I saw this launch

20
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,640
and when I saw the price tag and you

21
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,750
guys know exactly what I'm talking about

22
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,610
based on the title of the video I'm

23
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:46,350
talking about the brand new Kylie

24
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:48,300
cosmetics 360 dollar brush that I had to

25
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,739
show you guys the Realty I am gonna do

26
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,449
my entire makeup routine today using the

27
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:52,949
brand new Kylie brushes I'm gonna try to

28
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:53,910
use every single brush in here in some

29
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:55,320
difference that with my makeup routine

30
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,809
to show you guys if the brushes are

31
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,460
really worth the three hundred and sixty

32
00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:00,719
dollars I haven't even started yet but

33
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,370
just going into it I will tell you guys

34
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,460
they're probably not gonna be worth it

35
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:07,710
so I picked up dupes of every single one

36
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:09,119
of the Kylie brushes from morphe I'll

37
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,220
tell you guys right now they are much

38
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,080
much much cheaper so I'm gonna doing a

39
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,700
1/2 my face using the Kylie brushes and

40
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,280
the other half my face using the same

41
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,540
exact brush do and we're gonna see what

42
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,830
style looks better in the end

43
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,119
before we get to the full review I do

44
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,220
want to disclose something because this

45
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,590
video will not go all the way up my

46
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:27,390
Fenty Beauty video went I absolutely

47
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,650
love Kylie she's honestly one of my role

48
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,540
models I think she is beautiful and I'm

49
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,740
very very hard-working woman I am very

50
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,090
proud of her and her makeup line I think

51
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,950
so it's been absolutely incredible and

52
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,390
she is obviously killing it regardless

53
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,770
of what you think about her those are my

54
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,409
opinions you don't have to share them

55
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:41,820
not being said I am NOT on her PR list I

56
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:43,350
did not get these brushes sent to me

57
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,670
early in the mail I was actually gonna

58
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,140
have to wait another two weeks to get

59
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,250
them and order them just like everybody

60
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,020
else when they went online to the public

61
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,520
but major shout out to my baby but Kris

62
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,470
and Dominique who let me borrow her set

63
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,360
early I'm gonna give these brushes a

64
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:56,009
fair shot if they are amazing you will

65
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,689
see if they suck you guys will

66
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:59,070
definitely see I really could not care

67
00:01:57,689 --> 00:01:59,759
less about the fact that I'm not on her

68
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:01,140
PR list

69
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,880
like I said beforehand influencers

70
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,560
literally cannot win I love currently

71
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,219
but I'm not on her PR list so apparently

72
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,259
I'm so angry

73
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:08,550
so hopefully this evens out the playing

74
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:10,920
field so I can give you guys a full

75
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,940
unbiased review that would have been

76
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,550
unbiased Vergara

77
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:16,350
last by these comments Oh there are a

78
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:23,520
lot sometimes now that that is all been

79
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:24,630
said let's jump into the damn brushes so

80
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,330
for the holiday season Kylie cosmetics

81
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:29,550
launched chart silver luxury brushed sat

82
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:32,400
which is right here it comes with 16

83
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:36,480
different brushes and the set of all 16

84
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,340
retails online for 360 dollars oh my god

85
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,530
you get all the brushes and a little

86
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,790
silver carrying case with them as you

87
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,290
can see all the brushes have little

88
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:44,340
white hairs some of them are dual fiber

89
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:46,320
and some of them are just a regular

90
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,270
brushes and apparently Kylie said on

91
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,010
Twitter that these are all real hair as

92
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:51,960
well they are not synthetic

93
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:53,670
so that means they are I think not

94
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,660
cruelty free and not vegan so if that's

95
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,400
something that you were very out of it

96
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,330
about this brush is probably not the

97
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,440
brush that for you

98
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:00,090
I've talked about this a few times

99
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,190
before but I per say I'm really not the

100
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,840
biggest fan of brush sets when people

101
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:05,430
ask me what types of brushes to order I

102
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,050
always tell them to go through a website

103
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:08,850
and really pick up brushes that they

104
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:10,170
know they're going to use based on their

105
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:11,670
different steps of their makeup routine

106
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:12,720
everybody has different techniques and

107
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:14,460
different brushes that they like to use

108
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,630
for different things and I think when

109
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,070
you order a brush that they're always

110
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,810
gonna be a few brushes in there that you

111
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:20,070
will literally never touch simply

112
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:21,690
because of your personal choices when it

113
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:23,459
comes to makeup and that is really okay

114
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:25,470
but it's obviously money down the drain

115
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:27,000
I will say though looking at all the

116
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:28,560
Kylie brushes laid down next to each

117
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,790
other there really are not that many

118
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,110
brushes that I don't think I would pick

119
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:32,340
up and I feel like I could get a good

120
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,989
use out of all of them so at least

121
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,250
that's a really great thing if you are

122
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:36,690
someone like me though and don't like

123
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:38,340
brush sets all the brushes will be sold

124
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:40,320
individually online as well when the

125
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,640
full set launches I'm gonna go through

126
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,959
all the individual prices as I go

127
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,510
through my makeup routine but all

128
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,090
together these brushes equate to three

129
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:49,530
hundred and seventy eight dollars and if

130
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:52,410
you buy the set it takes eighteen

131
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:54,390
dollars off and goes to 360 what a steal

132
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:56,220
on the contrary I told her of all the

133
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:57,870
closest dupes I could find from morphe

134
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,670
and if you order all of these sixteen

135
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:02,010
brushes your total comes to one hundred

136
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:03,090
and fifteen dollars but if we use Co

137
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:04,590
change or ten percent of your purchase

138
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,730
which you've definitely should it

139
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:07,560
becomes one hundred and four dollars

140
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:10,019
which is two hundred and fifty six

141
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,940
dollars cheaper than the Kylie brushes

142
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:13,530
now that we have the price is all fully

143
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:15,120
broken down let's go ahead and start our

144
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,590
makeup on this side of my face I'm gonna

145
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,880
use the Kylie brushes and on this side

146
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,560
I'm gonna using the same dupes from

147
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,799
morphe and we're gonna see what side

148
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,960
performs better

149
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,069
let's go sir do my foundation today I'm

150
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,210
gonna use my Too Faced Born This Way

151
00:04:24,069 --> 00:04:27,099
Foundation do you guys know this is my

152
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:28,389
all-time favorite and for my less on my

153
00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:30,580
face I'm gonna use the Kylie brush

154
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:32,020
number two which is the large stippling

155
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,030
brush this brush has and his

156
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:36,009
multi-purpose face and body brush ideal

157
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:38,289
for blending liquid or cream makeup and

158
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:39,669
that retails for $30

159
00:04:38,289 --> 00:04:42,129
the closest dupe I could find for morphe

160
00:04:39,669 --> 00:04:43,479
was the mb5 brush as you can see the

161
00:04:42,129 --> 00:04:45,550
color is different but obviously they're

162
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:48,310
both duo fiber brushes of a very very

163
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:49,449
similar shape and this one is $10 this

164
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:50,470
is definitely an interesting feeling you

165
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:52,479
guys know that I don't really do my

166
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:54,069
foundation where the brush is that often

167
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,139
and also this is a duo fiber brush so

168
00:04:54,069 --> 00:04:57,880
it's really not that dense which is

169
00:04:56,139 --> 00:05:00,039
definitely giving us like my coverage

170
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,020
but oh I really like this for the neck

171
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:05,470
so big so it lets me blend it in easily

172
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:07,659
that was good but over the face I don't

173
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:09,250
know how I'm feeling for a duo fiber

174
00:05:07,659 --> 00:05:11,259
brush I'm honestly pleasantly surprised

175
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,490
with this application it definitely did

176
00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:14,500
a really good job of giving me even

177
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:16,030
coverage all throughout but I will say

178
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,349
that census is duo-fiber

179
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:19,180
you can obviously see that there's a lot

180
00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:21,250
of product in the brush now left over

181
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:22,690
and it's really not that dense so I do

182
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,310
feel like the coverage as an S fill as

183
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:26,080
normal if I applied it with a sponge

184
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:28,000
looking in the mirror the application

185
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,349
looks absolutely identical on both sides

186
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,789
they both honestly did a really good job

187
00:05:29,349 --> 00:05:32,710
of blending it out the coverage is

188
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:34,330
decent I'm gonna take a little bit more

189
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:36,250
of that on a Beauty Blender and apply it

190
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:37,599
to my nose because both brushes did

191
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,009
leave my nose a little bit sad and you

192
00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:40,360
guys know that is always a struggle area

193
00:05:39,009 --> 00:05:41,650
for me these brushes both did a

194
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,349
perfectly fine job of doing my

195
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:46,330
foundation except one is $30 and one is

196
00:05:44,349 --> 00:05:47,800
$10 and Kylie's line she does not have a

197
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:49,029
brush dedicated to concealer and I

198
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,529
personally never use the brush when it

199
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:51,610
comes to concealer either so I'm just

200
00:05:50,529 --> 00:05:53,740
gonna go ahead and apply my shake paper

201
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:54,969
in the shade light as normal before I go

202
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,409
in and blend this out I'm going to cream

203
00:05:54,969 --> 00:05:58,210
contour my face today using my benefit

204
00:05:56,409 --> 00:06:00,130
hoola stick you guys know that I really

205
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:02,620
don't do this that often but Kylie does

206
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:04,180
have a good a cream contour so for my

207
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:05,590
Kylie side i'm gonna using the kylie

208
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:07,810
jenner brush number seven which is the

209
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:10,840
medium stippling brush and these retails

210
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:14,020
for $22 and on my morphe side i'm gonna

211
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:17,020
using the m49 to literally the exact

212
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:18,460
same brush and this retails for $8 I'm

213
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:20,940
gonna put this in in the hollows of my

214
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,940
cheeks

215
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:30,070
on the jawline and then in the corners

216
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:30,070
on my forehead as well

217
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:43,560
oh just like the first brush as you can

218
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:45,420
see this is doing a really really great

219
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,010
job blending everything out there are no

220
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:49,590
streaky lines that everything is looking

221
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:51,270
at really really seamless I'm not gonna

222
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:52,350
go over to the morphe side so before

223
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,430
actually use these I thought that these

224
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,900
brushes were really really similar

225
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:56,910
shapes as you can see from this angle

226
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,950
but if we turn them to the side the

227
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:00,660
Kylie brush is actually a lot more thick

228
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:01,950
than the morphe brush I am noticing

229
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,570
right away that I have to blend a little

230
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:05,850
bit harder for the morphe brush and this

231
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:09,810
shape is actually not gonna lie a little

232
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:12,720
bit better but then again $22 $8 here's

233
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:15,090
the Kylie side and here's the morphe

234
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,890
side once again application looks

235
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:18,210
exactly the same I'm just gonna add a

236
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:20,460
lot about a shade table right here to

237
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:26,430
cut the contour and then I'm going to

238
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:27,330
blend everything out just up my face in

239
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:29,040
place today I'm going to using my

240
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:31,050
setting powder mixture you guys almost

241
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,790
my all-time favorite and for my Kylie

242
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:35,370
side I'm gonna be using the Kylie brush

243
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:38,460
number three which is the medium tapered

244
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:39,960
brush which retails for $28 and

245
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:42,360
originally for the morphe side I had

246
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,650
picked out the m5 30 but now looking at

247
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,750
these I'm realizing that these shapes

248
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:48,030
are nowhere near similar so I definitely

249
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:50,310
will take on that one and instead I'm

250
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:53,160
gonna be using the morphe r3 brush which

251
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:54,390
retails for or $12 you guys know that I

252
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,250
usually use my Beauty Blender when it

253
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:57,570
comes to setting powder so this is gonna

254
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,280
be a little bit interesting in this

255
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:00,660
definite a little bit babe to be an

256
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,360
under eye setting powder brush but you

257
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:04,650
know what we're gonna give it a try to

258
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,360
see but this is very very round

259
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:10,620
I would definitely prefer a more tapered

260
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:12,330
brush to do this something like this one

261
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,950
from its sigmod like this can really get

262
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:17,670
like right under there as you can see

263
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:19,110
but honestly the fact that this morphe

264
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:20,760
brush is a little bit more tapered and

265
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:22,200
synthetic I feel like it's applying the

266
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:24,030
powder better because it is a little bit

267
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,560
more dense and kind of packs it in there

268
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:27,600
whereas the Kylie brush is obviously

269
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,010
real hair so it kind of feels a little

270
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,200
bit strange to apply a setting powder

271
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:33,060
with but once again application looks

272
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,200
exactly the same to set the rest I face

273
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:36,780
in place I'm gonna use in the Kylie

274
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:39,180
brush number one which is the large

275
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:41,070
powder brush perfect for blending all of

276
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:45,030
her face and body powders and this one

277
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:46,230
retails for a whopping 48 dollars the

278
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:48,870
closest dupe I could find it was the

279
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:50,250
morphe m42 for the shape is slightly

280
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:52,380
different but they're both

281
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:53,970
huge dense powder brushes except this

282
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:56,730
one is $10 so you're saving yourself a

283
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:58,770
whopping 38 bucks I'm just going to take

284
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:02,910
this brush and tap off the excess oh my

285
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:08,550
god whoa that actually caught a lot of

286
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:10,550
powder I'm certainly not mad at it let's

287
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,760
go ahead and try the morphe brush oh

288
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:15,680
whoa

289
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,680
once again picked up a tip on a powder

290
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,830
once again application looks exactly the

291
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:24,660
same for bronzer today I'm gonna apply

292
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:26,910
the benefit hoola bronzer and I'm gonna

293
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:29,220
use the Kylie brush number four on this

294
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:30,570
side of my face this one retails for $26

295
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,870
and on my morphe sign I'm gonna use my a

296
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:35,100
matte 5 to 3 which we chose for $15 what

297
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:37,320
I do like about these brushes is that

298
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,610
they are pretty dense so when I go and

299
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,470
would like something like bronzer or

300
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:42,270
like a cream contour and kind of stipple

301
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:43,650
it into my face and kind of blend it it

302
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:45,480
doesn't pick up the product underneath

303
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:47,550
which it's a really really good thing

304
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,580
I'm gonna do the same exact thing on my

305
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:52,830
morphe side once again applications

306
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:54,090
exactly the same next for a more precise

307
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:56,190
contour I'm gonna go my Kat Von D shade

308
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:58,140
and light palette as always and I might

309
00:09:56,190 --> 00:10:01,080
highly say it I'm gonna grab my number 5

310
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:02,550
brush which retails for $24 and on my

311
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,260
morphe side I'm gonna grab my M for all

312
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:05,880
five it retails for eight dollars and as

313
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,830
you can see these are literally the

314
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:12,930
exact same brush I'm just gonna tuck

315
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:17,970
that right into the cheekbone and then

316
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:19,410
same exact thing I really doubt you can

317
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:20,670
tell on camera but in person I feel like

318
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,350
I can tell just because they look at my

319
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:24,600
face with makeup on almost every single

320
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:26,250
day the bristles on the M 405 from

321
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,500
morphe are a lot softer so it's making

322
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,760
I'm much more diffused contour wears on

323
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,080
the Kylie brush so brushes are a lot

324
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,570
more dense which makes it a little bit

325
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:35,580
harder for a diffused application but to

326
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:37,080
the everyday makeup person nobody can

327
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,820
tell it looks the exact same let's be

328
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,320
real next I'm gonna play my blush which

329
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,880
is gonna be a Mac peach is my all-time

330
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,070
favorite and from the Kylie site I'm

331
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:47,310
gonna be using my number six brush which

332
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:49,530
is the rounded blush brush this retails

333
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:51,870
for $28 mmm I'm or if we say I'm gonna

334
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:53,430
use my g1 brush which is the closest

335
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:55,200
dupe I could find this one is eight

336
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:56,490
dollars now looking at these obviously

337
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,530
this is a synthetic brush so I would

338
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:00,120
really never use this for blush that's

339
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:01,020
definitely more like a buffer brush for

340
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,090
like blending in found a

341
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:04,800
but you know what sister Kylie says it's

342
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:09,090
for blush we're gonna use it for blush

343
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:11,850
oh yeah I do not like that I would just

344
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:13,650
never reach for this shape or type of

345
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:15,660
brush when it comes to blush application

346
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:17,640
I usually use my p4 brush which as you

347
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:19,620
can see it's very very soft an ankle -

348
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:22,320
lets you get a very very like diffused

349
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:24,650
light wash of color this is very very

350
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:33,840
done so I'm probably spooked to try out

351
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:35,310
the G one oh my god Kylie side morphe

352
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,900
side it certainly doesn't look bad I

353
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:38,910
would just literally never reach for

354
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:40,290
those brushes when it comes to blush one

355
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:42,780
fly condors are all in place I'm going

356
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:43,580
to bake my face as usual using my Beauty

357
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,450
Blender

358
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:46,830
while I'm picking the oven I'm gonna go

359
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:48,090
ahead and quickly dry brows off-camera

360
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:50,160
then it will come back for the cleanup

361
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:51,240
process Kylie did not release any angled

362
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,830
brushes so I'm just gonna use my eyebrow

363
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,420
pencil I'll be right back

364
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:56,040
alright scissors back to business I'm

365
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:59,220
gonna go my tart shape table as always

366
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:02,460
my Kylie brush number 14 this one is $18

367
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:03,870
and my m22 for $3

368
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:05,910
you guys know that I usually do my

369
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:07,710
concealer application using a flat top

370
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:09,720
concealer brush so I really don't think

371
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:14,180
that I'm going to enjoy the application

372
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,180
on either side but the brush did fine

373
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:21,930
to stop my eyelid concealer in place and

374
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:24,779
prime for eyeshadow I'm gonna use my

375
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:26,699
Kylie number 10 brush this is $20 and is

376
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:29,130
the large shader brush although it is

377
00:12:26,699 --> 00:12:30,449
super super dense this is literally not

378
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:31,829
an eyeshadow brush I don't know what she

379
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:34,079
thinks she's doing calling this a large

380
00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:35,759
shader brush trying to get this to put

381
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,759
any eyeshadow on the eyelid and make it

382
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:40,170
like any sort of defined or blended out

383
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:41,399
it's not happening I really do like the

384
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:42,779
shape and density of this brush for

385
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:45,000
packing on trends with a primer to the

386
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:46,139
list but this is classified as a large

387
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,240
shader brush that I would literally

388
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:49,829
never use this for any sort of shading

389
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,000
on the eyeshadow so I think this would

390
00:12:49,829 --> 00:12:52,889
be one of the brushes that like I said

391
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,509
it's useless to the set for the more of

392
00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:56,759
you said I'm gonna grab my five to four

393
00:12:54,509 --> 00:12:59,009
brush and this one is $6 so you're

394
00:12:56,759 --> 00:13:03,180
saving yourself $14 just to set your

395
00:12:59,009 --> 00:13:04,709
frickin eyelid concealer in place I want

396
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:06,300
to do it very Kylie I look today and I

397
00:13:04,709 --> 00:13:08,310
do have a red carpet later on so I don't

398
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:10,170
want to do anything too too intense I'm

399
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:12,810
gonna grab the MAC Cosmetics Act

400
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:14,430
Patrick Starr eyes shadow quads I am so

401
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:16,410
happy and proud of sisters are for these

402
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:18,029
amazing collaborations they are so dope

403
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:19,500
so I'm just gonna doing a fun I liquid

404
00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:21,149
these today for transition shade I'm

405
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:23,519
going to dip into this light brown shade

406
00:13:21,149 --> 00:13:25,230
in this quad with my Kylie number 15

407
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,779
brush this is the tapered blending brush

408
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:28,949
and it is $28 and on the morphe said I'm

409
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:33,000
gonna do the same exact thing using

410
00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:35,819
Miami 5:13 and this one is $6 oh whoa

411
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:46,319
okay not gonna lie this feels really

412
00:13:35,819 --> 00:13:48,180
really nice on the eyelid next I'm gonna

413
00:13:46,319 --> 00:13:51,089
dip into it this shade right here using

414
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:52,800
my Kylie number 12 brush this one is $20

415
00:13:51,089 --> 00:13:54,750
and I'm going to use the exact dupe

416
00:13:52,800 --> 00:14:01,740
which is the morphe I'm up for 3 3 which

417
00:13:54,750 --> 00:14:03,540
is $6 interesting even though these

418
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:05,370
brushes are two very very similar shapes

419
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:07,170
and sizes the Kylie brush actually

420
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:09,029
doesn't really taper out on the top it

421
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:10,889
kind of stays the same density whereas

422
00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:12,839
the morphe brush does taper out a little

423
00:14:10,889 --> 00:14:15,779
bit more so I think in this scenario I

424
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:16,740
do prefer the M 4-3-3 from morphe simply

425
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:19,139
because it allows for a much more

426
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:20,250
blended application I'm next gonna dip

427
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:22,410
into this brown shade using my number

428
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:24,600
thirteen brush this is the small shader

429
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:26,040
brush and it is $18 and on the other

430
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,959
side I'm gonna grab my a matte one five

431
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,680
three foot morpheus same exact shape

432
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:31,749
this one is $2

433
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,339
I'm just gonna pack the shade right on

434
00:14:31,749 --> 00:14:35,499
that outer V it too deep out that edge

435
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:41,529
and then pull it slightly into the

436
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:43,029
crease same situation with this lash

437
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:44,619
brush as you can see over here it kind

438
00:14:43,029 --> 00:14:46,179
of looks a little bit unblended

439
00:14:44,619 --> 00:14:47,769
that's because the top edge doesn't

440
00:14:46,179 --> 00:14:49,509
taper off at all it's actually more of a

441
00:14:47,769 --> 00:14:52,029
rounded thing it makes it really really

442
00:14:49,509 --> 00:14:58,959
hard for a precise application in the

443
00:14:52,029 --> 00:15:00,040
crease I'm gonna go over those I just

444
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,959
make sure they're really blend it out

445
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,339
using my number eleven brush from Kylie

446
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:05,379
which is sixteen dollars it is this

447
00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:06,279
angled blending brush I personally hate

448
00:15:05,379 --> 00:15:07,720
these brushes and think there's

449
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:09,579
literally no point of them they do

450
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,779
absolutely nothing but just to this

451
00:15:09,579 --> 00:15:12,999
think of it I do want to use all the

452
00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:24,160
brushes and for the morphe dupe is my m5

453
00:15:12,999 --> 00:15:25,480
16 this one is six dollars for my eyelid

454
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,860
I'm gonna grab the Kylee concealer brush

455
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,929
this is the number fourteen brush that I

456
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:31,600
use for my brows earlier and dip into

457
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:32,619
this shade right up in here and I'm

458
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,839
going to give it a little bit of a

459
00:15:32,619 --> 00:15:36,129
spritz with some fix+ and then I'm just

460
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:43,449
gonna pack this right onto the inner

461
00:15:36,129 --> 00:15:45,970
eyelid I know this is a kylie review but

462
00:15:43,449 --> 00:15:49,499
Wow sister Patrick snapped on these

463
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:49,499
shots so good

464
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:56,510
for my lower lash that I'm going to dip

465
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:59,480
into that same warm brown shade on my

466
00:15:56,510 --> 00:16:00,860
number thirteen brush and also my m1 5/3

467
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:03,100
brush that I'm gonna use this to define

468
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,100
it

469
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:17,830
oh that was way easier with that brush

470
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:19,690
and then finally with my number 12 slash

471
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:21,580
m4a3 three brush I'm gonna dip into the

472
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:24,540
original transition shade and just go

473
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,540
right over that bottom edge

474
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:30,820
all right scissors off Kara I quickly

475
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:32,920
just went apply of some wing liner on in

476
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:34,480
both eyes to snatch up this look popped

477
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,680
on some lashes these are the new bounds

478
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,120
I'm a dragon lean mini and then of

479
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,160
course a mascara to blend them together

480
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,930
looking in the mirror this eye look is

481
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,730
beautiful sister Patrick you killed it

482
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:44,740
with this collection but that is not the

483
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:46,660
focus of this video let's be real both

484
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:48,280
of these eyes look exactly the same

485
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:49,630
let's go ahead finish off the rest of

486
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:53,280
the face I'm gonna grab both my big

487
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:53,280
powder brushes and brush away the bake

488
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:58,360
before we highly I'm gonna get my skin a

489
00:16:56,590 --> 00:17:00,490
quick spritz of my mac fix+

490
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,750
just to kind of meld all those powders

491
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:04,570
together because let's be real we

492
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:05,740
definitely have a lot on today for

493
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:07,060
highlighter on my Kylie said I'm gonna

494
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:08,860
grab my number eight brush which is

495
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:10,330
these small fluff brush and dip into my

496
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:11,830
Anasazi so hollywood illuminator you

497
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:14,320
guys know it's my all-time favorite and

498
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:16,600
this one retails for a whopping up $22

499
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:19,330
she's gonna give this a slight spritz as

500
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:24,550
well and pop this right on the cheekbone

501
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:26,350
oh whoa okay obviously this is doing a

502
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:28,990
really great job of applying a blinding

503
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:30,850
highly I mean damn I will say though

504
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:32,350
once again this brush is not really

505
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:34,690
tapered on the top it is kind of more

506
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:36,670
like slightly rounded almost even flat

507
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:38,980
and it is pretty dense so it's

508
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:40,810
definitely not like blending it out as

509
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:42,970
much as I would love it to my Murphy

510
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:45,730
said I'm gonna grab my our 31 brush this

511
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:47,500
one is a total of five dollars once

512
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:51,160
again giving it a light sprit and then

513
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:53,080
popping it on the cheekbone yep same

514
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,190
exact glow you guys know when it comes

515
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,930
to highlight in my face I usually will

516
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:57,700
reach for a looking am 501 brush

517
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:59,620
obviously the shape is very very

518
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:01,540
different but I am going for exact dupes

519
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:03,760
today I do wish this brush was more

520
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:06,550
tapered like this one for a more precise

521
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,620
application but you know what we can't

522
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:10,000
always get what we want in life I'm

523
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,740
gonna go back into like highly number 5

524
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,120
brush and just make sure that my contour

525
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:14,940
and highlighter are nice and blended

526
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,230
together and not looking too

527
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:21,270
and same exact thing on the work piece

528
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:22,590
out of Miami 405 next we have the number

529
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:24,720
nine brush and then do my heart for this

530
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:26,070
is the morphe three one you guys know

531
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,330
that I really am not the biggest fan of

532
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:29,430
fan brush especially when it comes to

533
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:30,840
hiding I just don't like the application

534
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:32,580
work are all this I'm gonna use it today

535
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,050
just the sake of the video this one is

536
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:36,210
twenty dollars and this one is five

537
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:37,800
dollars I'm gonna dip into the slightest

538
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:40,440
bit of artist Couture Illuminati and

539
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:46,620
just place that right on the high points

540
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:50,970
of my highlighter I feel like that did

541
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:52,440
nothing once again make that did nothing

542
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:54,660
can people just stop making fan brushes

543
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:57,720
literally this has been a PSA James

544
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:59,910
Charles hates me eye brushes and last

545
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:02,820
but certainly not least we have the

546
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:05,070
Kylie brush number six teen this is a

547
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:08,370
tiny pencil brush this one retails for

548
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:12,780
eighteen whopping dollars compared to

549
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:14,220
the morphe m43 one which retails for as

550
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,750
you can see they're both tiny pencil

551
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,490
brushes i will say that the morphe want

552
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:19,470
is a little bit more tapered so that is

553
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:20,820
my fault but let's be real based on a

554
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:22,830
trend of all the brushes we've tried so

555
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:24,480
far they're gonna perform exactly the

556
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:26,220
same for my inner corner i'm gonna be

557
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,230
using one of the Tarte chrome pots and

558
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:29,460
this is the shade of top yacht this is a

559
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:31,230
check that I tried a few days ago and I

560
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,850
absolutely loved how it look this is

561
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:34,890
just so bright and blinding and of

562
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:36,900
course I'm using my Kylie number 16

563
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:41,610
brush I'm gonna spritz it the slightest

564
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:42,780
bit and just pop it right on you see how

565
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:43,950
bright that is oh my god this is

566
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:50,460
literally the best thing that ever it's

567
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:51,600
so freakin pretty hello alright guys I

568
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,800
just wanna hadn't thrown a lip quickly

569
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,700
off camera this is the ofra liquid

570
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,580
lipstick in the shade

571
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:57,930
and that completes this luck as you can

572
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:59,430
see here we have the Kylie brush aside

573
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:01,260
totaling at three hundred and sixty

574
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:02,430
dollars and on the other side we have

575
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:04,860
morphe brushes totaling at one hundred

576
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:06,270
and four dollars now my face is all

577
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,860
complete and I've used every single one

578
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:10,290
of these brushes from both collections

579
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:11,850
let's go ahead and spill the tea once

580
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:13,560
another Kylie brushes on line let's be

581
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:14,880
real we were all shook as hell by the

582
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,500
price point three hundred sixty dollars

583
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,380
especially for a new brand like Kylie is

584
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,490
way way too high that being said though

585
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:22,350
almost every single products news

586
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:24,030
release in the past has been pretty good

587
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:24,999
like I said I'm not on her PR let so

588
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:26,889
everything that I've tried from

589
00:20:24,999 --> 00:20:28,539
has been a personally bought from me not

590
00:20:26,889 --> 00:20:30,189
being paid to say anything but it is

591
00:20:28,539 --> 00:20:31,869
pretty good stuff so major props to

592
00:20:30,189 --> 00:20:33,789
Kelly for that based on Carly's past

593
00:20:31,869 --> 00:20:34,929
product has 3ik going into this I really

594
00:20:33,789 --> 00:20:37,509
didn't think the brushes were gonna be

595
00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:39,159
bad at all and let's be real they really

596
00:20:37,509 --> 00:20:40,509
weren't most of the brushes did exactly

597
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:42,699
what they were supposed to do and one of

598
00:20:40,509 --> 00:20:44,169
them being number seven in my opinion

599
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:45,819
even performed better than the dupe from

600
00:20:44,169 --> 00:20:47,199
morphe on the other hand Harbor there

601
00:20:45,819 --> 00:20:49,299
were a few more view brushes that in my

602
00:20:47,199 --> 00:20:51,219
opinion outperformed Kylie mostly being

603
00:20:49,299 --> 00:20:52,779
the eye brushes a lot of the blending

604
00:20:51,219 --> 00:20:54,009
brushes specifically number 12 did a

605
00:20:52,779 --> 00:20:56,019
really really great job at packing the

606
00:20:54,009 --> 00:20:58,059
color on there but I will say that I

607
00:20:56,019 --> 00:20:59,319
wish they were more tapered all the tops

608
00:20:58,059 --> 00:21:00,879
of these brushes are very very rounded

609
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:02,409
which is great however they're very very

610
00:21:00,879 --> 00:21:04,089
dense at the top and don't really taper

611
00:21:02,409 --> 00:21:05,739
out which makes it a little bit harder

612
00:21:04,089 --> 00:21:07,089
to get a more precise application that's

613
00:21:05,739 --> 00:21:09,159
actually when it comes to crease work

614
00:21:07,089 --> 00:21:11,159
overall what I recommend the Kylie

615
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:13,479
cosmetics silver luxury brush sat

616
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:14,559
absolutely not the brushes all did

617
00:21:13,479 --> 00:21:16,389
exactly what they're supposed to do and

618
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,109
applied the makeup perfectly fine just

619
00:21:16,389 --> 00:21:18,549
like normal

620
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:20,409
none of the brushes are fraying and they

621
00:21:18,549 --> 00:21:22,029
are really really good-quality I just

622
00:21:20,409 --> 00:21:23,829
don't think it's worth the price point I

623
00:21:22,029 --> 00:21:25,029
really just can't justify spending three

624
00:21:23,829 --> 00:21:26,169
hundred sixty dollars on her brush set

625
00:21:25,029 --> 00:21:28,269
when their brands out there like morphe

626
00:21:26,169 --> 00:21:30,039
making the exact same dupes for way

627
00:21:28,269 --> 00:21:32,049
cheaper I mean literally I think the

628
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:33,879
cheapest morphe brush was $2.00 and the

629
00:21:32,049 --> 00:21:35,469
cheapest Kylie brush was $18 I mean

630
00:21:33,879 --> 00:21:36,279
there's even like BH Cosmetics out there

631
00:21:35,469 --> 00:21:39,699
where you can literally get the same

632
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:41,529
exact brush set for $15 don't get me

633
00:21:39,699 --> 00:21:43,269
wrong I really really love Kylie but

634
00:21:41,529 --> 00:21:45,069
that's literally some people's entire

635
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:47,139
like house payment or rent payment or

636
00:21:45,069 --> 00:21:48,789
car payment like that is just way too

637
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,959
much it is not like these brushes are

638
00:21:48,789 --> 00:21:52,089
literally doing our makeup for us or

639
00:21:49,959 --> 00:21:53,199
face tuning our photos after I'm not

640
00:21:52,089 --> 00:21:54,879
gonna tell Kylie how to run her brand

641
00:21:53,199 --> 00:21:57,399
because clearly she's doing a perfectly

642
00:21:54,879 --> 00:21:58,509
fine job on her own she made almost five

643
00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:02,349
hundred million dollars last year

644
00:21:58,509 --> 00:22:03,399
literally a living legend but I do wish

645
00:22:02,349 --> 00:22:04,809
she would make her mice a lot more

646
00:22:03,399 --> 00:22:07,059
affordable so more people could get them

647
00:22:04,809 --> 00:22:08,289
and not just a beauty gurus all that

648
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:10,119
being said though if you are a huge

649
00:22:08,289 --> 00:22:11,919
Kylie stand like myself and you want to

650
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:12,939
