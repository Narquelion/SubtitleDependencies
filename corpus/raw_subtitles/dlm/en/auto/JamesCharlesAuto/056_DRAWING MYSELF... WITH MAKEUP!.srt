00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,420

do want to say I do have a few things to

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,220
go over in today's video intro before we

13
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,050
actually get started so I'll try to keep

14
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,070
it short and sweet and brief and try to

15
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:27,570
spice it up with a little bit of editing

16
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,849

is all on the table and we are ready to

76
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:17,120
go I'm so pumped tell you guys about

77
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,680
today's app for a new video a few weeks

78
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,450
ago on my youtube channel I uploaded a

79
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,770
video called a makeup artist tries dry

80
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,910
if you have not yet checked it out make

81
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:24,530
sure to click right up here but

82
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:26,030
basically I shared with you guys the one

83
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:27,860
art form that actually got me started

84
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:29,870
into makeup in the first place which was

85
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:31,490
not makeup and was drying with charcoal

86
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:33,200
and one of the top comments that I saw a

87
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:34,670
lot over and over again on the video is

88
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,050
that instead of drawing with charcoal I

89
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:37,700
should actually try drawing with makeup

90
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:38,900
what a lot of you guys may not know is

91
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,000
that that artwork actually already

92
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,530
exists and they're called face charts I

93
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,940
wasn't exactly able to find information

94
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:45,290
on the origin or invention of face

95
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,820
charts but I do know that they are

96
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,290
popularized by one of the biggest beauty

97
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:50,510
brands in the entire world known for

98
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,950
their artistry not cosmetics based

99
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:53,330
charts are basically outlines of faces

100
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,740
printed on a very very special type of

101
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:55,910
paper for makeup artists are able to

102
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,170
play with different makeup books that

103
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:58,550
before they actually put them on a model

104
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:59,840
for the runway because of the fact that

105
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:01,370
these charts are flat and are basically

106
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,660
a blank canvas there are endless

107
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:04,130
possibilities of different looks and

108
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,810
designs that people can make and whether

109
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:06,950
it be for a runway or for Instagram a

110
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,600
lot of Devore artists had actually taken

111
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:09,739
face sharding to the next level and I've

112
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,930
been able to make careers out of them

113
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:13,070
milk 14:22 and cons the MUA are two

114
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:14,209
different artists that come to mind that

115
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:15,739
had built majority of their following

116
00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:16,760
off the beautiful face charts and a lot

117
00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:18,200
of different influencers like myself

118
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,550
have recreated on they're very different

119
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,020
YouTube channels and Instagram feeds

120
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:23,600

121
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:25,580
little bit extra so I got made custom

I've never done this before by do you

124
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,770
think it'll be very very fun so without

125
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:32,209
further ado I have Ollie makeup laid out

126
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:33,320

00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:34,580
jump into this don't forget to watch

128
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,200

00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:40,340
contest of regarding these patients and

130
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:43,490
let's get glam on paper

131
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:43,490
[Music]

132
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:47,250
all right you guys we were all set up

133
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,360
and ready to go we have the regular

134
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,760
camera angle that you guys are used to

135
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,349
seeing and we also have this good and

136
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,760
fun and fresh camera angle right down

137
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:55,019
here I think I want to do the papers

138
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,790
make up in the same order that I would

139
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:59,040
do with my makeup starting off with this

140
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:00,300
skin so obviously I can't use foundation

141
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,250
I can only use powder so how's the

142
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,599
Anasazi a contour book which is little

143
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,970
been sitting on my shelf for the longest

144
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,680
time looks like a display item has dust

145
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:09,239
on it sorry but I think this would be a

146
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,739
really good to use it for today's video

147
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:13,590
being that it is literally a book of a

148
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:15,060
million different color powders hello

149
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:18,720

154
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:30,470
foundation and just put this on there I

155
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:35,490
think I'm just gonna lay down a light

156
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:37,229
layer of skin because I think I want to

157
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:38,220
make my skin tone slightly darker than

158
00:04:37,229 --> 00:04:40,020
what it normally is

159
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,820
no scandals please it's also been this

160
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:44,300
weird thing where if you rub it in too

161
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:47,669
hard the paper leak starts to get

162
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:49,500

have to actually like sketch out my nose

196
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:45,750
this is hard how do I do that ask Ohio

a Beauty Blender and like dipping into

203
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:13,590
the actual powder and placing about that

204
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:13,590
way will actually like make a difference

205
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,720
no well actually yeah kind of

206
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,409

figured it out

214
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:49,169
I've cracked the code oh my god now this

215
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:50,819
is a person ah Wow I snapped okay great

216
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:54,749
I'm kind of like happy with this so far

217
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:58,169
low key the lowest of keys we're gonna

218
00:07:54,749 --> 00:07:59,370
start on the eyebrows so for the eye

219
00:07:58,169 --> 00:08:01,349
region of the brown region I'm gonna be

220
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:02,789
using the morphia 39a palette this is

221
00:08:01,349 --> 00:08:04,499
the palette that I level before last

222
00:08:02,789 --> 00:08:06,149
year for holiday season and in its back

223
00:08:04,499 --> 00:08:08,009
in stock don't forget to use coach jeans

224
00:08:06,149 --> 00:08:09,749
for 10% off of course I'm gonna grab the

225
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:11,789
Mac brow marker and the shame that

226
00:08:09,749 --> 00:08:17,729
spiked and you got to kind of sketch out

227
00:08:11,789 --> 00:08:20,899
the outline of the brow first okay there

228
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:20,899
we go that looks done to you

229
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:33,210
oh my god t-this actually looks kind of

230
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:34,860
good okay literally I had a guide to

231
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:37,260
work with on paper and somehow eyebrows

232
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,890
are still and not even how did that even

233
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,960
happen

234
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:41,100
I don't deserve this okay so I'm gonna

235
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,080
start this auction looking I think I

236
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:45,000
wanted to like a sunset smokey eye a

237
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,560
moment with a pop of blue which is

238
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,240
perfect for the 38 palette so I'm first

239
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,350
gonna start by grabbing an orange shade

240
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:55,520
and my m4 33 usko chance for 10% off and

241
00:08:51,350 --> 00:09:02,040
I guess let's just like put it on there

242
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:06,030
okay faint blending it out for real one

243
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:10,680
oh my god I literally love this next

244
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:12,900
tune to grab a red shade oh so pretty

245
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:17,090
Hello why did that one go on so easy and

246
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:17,090
the other ones didn't what

247
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:29,350
oh my god this looks so pretty hello

248
00:09:25,779 --> 00:09:33,610
this is literally so fun I'm obsessed

249
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:36,339
with this oh good this looks oh so now

250
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:38,320
I'm gonna add in a little pop of blue on

251
00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:39,700
the eyelid what should actually be

252
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,019
pretty easy I'm just gonna start by

253
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,100
carving the kind of Navy show you know

254
00:09:41,019 --> 00:09:44,230
from the palette and give me a little

255
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,730
bit of a sister spread since it is a

256
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:48,000
metallic shade and popping that kind of

257
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:48,000
right

258
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:58,480
that looks bad that looks gross oh it

259
00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:01,519
sounds better

260
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,930
thank God I was sister spooped for a

261
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,459
second there now we're gonna go into the

262
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:06,139
eyes and lashes and not even gonna lie I

263
00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:07,490
am a little bit kind of really nervous

264
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:10,040
for this just because of the fact that

265
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:11,930
I'm really really not good at drawing

266
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,430
lashes I struggle with this and a

267
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:16,910
portraits and obviously I'm going to

268
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:18,050
struggle with it here so I'm first gonna

269
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:23,600
start by just shading in the eyeball

270
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:25,490
with a light brown color I guess I'm

271
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,589
just gonna use my regular liner to try

272
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:38,139
to draw in eyelashes and pray that it

273
00:10:27,589 --> 00:10:44,029
looks somewhat okay that's an ugly loss

274
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:46,209
no oh okay I'm going to join the bottom

275
00:10:44,029 --> 00:10:46,209
lashes

276
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,829
that's like okay it could be worse but

277
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:54,339
it's like not bad and add in the

278
00:10:51,829 --> 00:10:54,339
highlights of the eye

279
00:10:55,170 --> 00:11:04,189
oh my god that actually made it look

280
00:10:58,859 --> 00:11:04,189
real tea

281
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,139
all right you guys I think that is I

282
00:11:11,369 --> 00:11:14,579
number one all done I'm not gonna go

283
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:15,869
touch up but I have another eye to do

284
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:17,519
off-camera and that took me quite a long

285
00:11:15,869 --> 00:11:18,749
time so I'm gonna go ahead and try as

286
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,009
hard as I possibly can to get them

287
00:11:18,749 --> 00:11:21,569
symmetrical and I'll be right back to

288
00:11:20,009 --> 00:11:22,889
finish off the rest of the look all

289
00:11:21,569 --> 00:11:24,540
right you guys we are back in both eyes

290
00:11:22,889 --> 00:11:25,949
are all complete and actually loving how

291
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:28,529
this is turning out so far this is

292
00:11:25,949 --> 00:11:30,149
definitely hard like I expected it to be

293
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:31,439
but I don't like getting the hang of

294
00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:32,459
things a little bit more this is

295
00:11:31,439 --> 00:11:33,629
definitely art form that takes a lot of

296
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:35,160
practice and a whole lot of

297
00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:36,600
concentration and Charl and error as

298
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,189
well now that we have both eyes all

299
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,489
complete we are actually pretty close to

300
00:11:38,189 --> 00:11:40,739
done

301
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:42,389
I accidentally may have done majority of

302
00:11:40,739 --> 00:11:44,850
the nose off camera because I forgot

303
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:45,989
that I was not recording oops so that

304
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:48,389
only leaves us with kind of like the

305
00:11:45,989 --> 00:11:50,160
cheeks and the lips left to go so I'm

306
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:51,480
gonna grab the Mac blush and the shaded

307
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,249
peaches you guys know that's my all-time

308
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,379
favorite I'm just gonna use like a flap

309
00:11:53,249 --> 00:12:04,319
Hocking foundation brush and really step

310
00:11:55,379 --> 00:12:05,600
on there pretty uh oh my god this is so

311
00:12:04,319 --> 00:12:07,529
pretty yeah

312
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,779
James Shaw was getting excited over a

313
00:12:07,529 --> 00:12:11,910
piece of paper heard 30 minutes straight

314
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:12,989
I really snapped north on her lips I'm

315
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:14,549
gonna go ahead and apply the shade at

316
00:12:12,989 --> 00:12:16,559
Kylie liquid lipstick in the shade of

317
00:12:14,549 --> 00:12:20,689
one wish I really hope that you can like

318
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:20,689
put this on there

319
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:30,630
oh my god why is my bottle left in this

320
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:33,990
photo so big she's a beefy car all too

321
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:37,920
much stupider is this me having a

322
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:44,760
revelation no it's very normal-sized so

323
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:45,900
I'm gonna outline the inside now and you

324
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,420
just kept saying that my little teeth

325
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:49,590
that always show through okay now I'm

326
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,540
gonna use the Anasazi look with lipstick

327
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:54,030
in the shade and milkshake and use this

328
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:55,710
to kind of highlight the like center

329
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:58,440
portion of the lips to like make it look

330
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:59,820
actually 3d or not stupid okay so I'm

331
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,380
pretty much on at this point but the one

332
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:04,950
thing that I'm like not loving how it

333
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:06,720
looks is the nose contour because it's

334
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:10,350
hard um so I'm gonna add some fake

335
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,640
freckles to distract from my lack of

336
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:14,100
contouring ability and then I'm just

337
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:16,360
gonna use that Mac brow pencil or brown

338
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:20,090
marker thing and drawing some freckles I

339
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:22,200
[Music]

340
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:23,730
think it's time to show your sisters

341
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,320
that the finish I faced her please take

342
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:29,510
it easy on me this is only my first try

343
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:31,650
and probably my last for a while but

344
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,890
okay T on camera doc she looks really

345
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:34,890
good

346
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:37,980
hello whoa it looks the best

347
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:40,500
wait I'm so proud of this okay let's

348
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,520
spell the team overall I'm really proud

349
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,680
of how this turned out that I'm actually

350
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,120
really really happy with it too but

351
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,070
starting off I was really not thinking

352
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,990
too positively because this isn't really

353
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:49,950
really hard I definitely picked up on

354
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:51,780
the fact that with this paper you

355
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:53,220
definitely need to scan in at the actual

356
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,450
product that you're using specifically

357
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,040
the foundation powders that I was using

358
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:57,660
to kind of lay down the base early on it

359
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,070
because blending really is not the tea

360
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:01,200
and it actually just ends up picking up

361
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:02,430
the powder from the paper I really

362
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,720
really love how the brows and eyes

363
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:05,280
turned out I feel like this is very very

364
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,780
similar to how my face would look if I

365
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,490
had this look on which of course was the

366
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:09,630
goal with this I do wish the lashes were

367
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:10,710
a little bit better I said in the

368
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:11,880
beginning going into it that I didn't

369
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:13,230
think they were gonna be that good and

370
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:15,000
if they definitely could look a whole

371
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:15,990
lot more realistic I probably should

372
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,340
have used a little bit of a lighter

373
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:19,170
lighter and lighter pressure because

374
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:21,270
they look a little bit chunky not gonna

375
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:22,860
lie but the eyes definitely happy with

376
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:24,630
that's where the nose and fake freckles

377
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,890
definitely not my strong that part of

378
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,360
this t-shirt I will say that the

379
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:28,650
freckles did end up looking a little bit

380
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,710
better once I kind of layered over a

381
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:31,030
face powder and a little bit

382
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:32,620
more kind of blush color to make the

383
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:34,090
ferals look sunkissed like I normally do

384
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:35,950
on my makeup but they do look a little

385
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:37,180
bit more intense and shading and nose no

386
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:39,010
matter what medium you're using whether

387
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:40,540
it be a makeup or charcoal like you guys

388
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:42,160
saw in the last video is really really

389
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,700
hard and it's definitely not my strong

390
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,210
suit

391
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:49,480
Oh laughs probably not least the lips

392
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:51,220
are not good all that being said though

393
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,900
that is my face hair all complete

394
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:54,820
I love how it turned out but this video

395
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:56,080
is not yet complete because like I told

396
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:57,940
