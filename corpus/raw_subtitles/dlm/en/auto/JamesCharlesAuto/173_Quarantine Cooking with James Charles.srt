00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,689
hi sisters James Charles here and

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,160
welcome back to my youtube channel in

3
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:07,620
the comment on my videos I get a lot of

4
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,970
requests to do other videos and most of

5
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,370
the time they make sense and are great

6
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,469
ideas and then there's videos like the

7
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:15,990
one we're gonna be doing today I do not

8
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:18,480
understand why you guys keep asking me

9
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:21,630
to do cooking videos but here we are I

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,189
James Charles can not cook I'm admitting

11
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,840
it right now before I even get into this

12
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:27,090
okay it is just not a skill that I have

13
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,740
in my repertoire if you will I post

14
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,359
mates three out of three meals of the

15
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,640
day it's just not really a skill that

16
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,770
I've ever like gotten good at but that

17
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,329
being said okay I love cooking I love

18
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,219
the Food Network i watch the bone

19
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:44,460
Appetit videos on YouTube all day every

20
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:45,750
single day and on a more serious note

21
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,010
obviously the world right now is in a

22
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,450
little bit of a crisis we're dealing

23
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,050
with a Copa 19 also known as the

24
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,270
provirus

25
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:53,219
and a lot of places such as la are on

26
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,899
lockdown and we can't really leave our

27
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:57,090

53
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:50,979
laptop and actually found a recipe

54
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:52,299
online by the website healthy junk food

55
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:53,799
which shallots then they're an amazing

56
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:54,819
channel here on YouTube actually not

57
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:56,679
done a few weeks why playlists they were

58
00:01:54,819 --> 00:01:58,030
super super nice and they have a recipe

59
00:01:56,679 --> 00:01:59,500
on how to recreate Cannes so I'm gonna

60
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:00,819
be following this I'll leave the link

61
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,469
down below in case any of you guys want

62
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:03,640
to recreate it as well but let's go

63
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:05,259
ahead and get started

64
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:08,440
it said this is only gonna take 10

65
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:09,819
minutes to prepare and four minutes to

66
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,010
cook yeah I guarantee all will be here

67
00:02:09,819 --> 00:02:13,299
for at least two hours together so sit

68
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:14,709
down side well but you know hope that

69
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:16,870
this turns out good our ingredients are

70
00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:18,790
going to be some nice chicken breasts

71
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:20,560
two cups of flour some salt sitting on

72
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:23,260
our 2 eggs 2 cups of buttermilk which we

73
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:27,819
could not find so we have a regular milk

74
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:29,440
we also have half in half butter I'm not

75
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:31,810
really sure if we can like combine

76
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,890
butter and mill to make buttermilk that

77
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,819
might be one of the most ignorant

78
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:34,930
sentence ever

79
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:36,459
but do you know what we're gonna figure

80
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:38,019
it out because we have to make do with

81
00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:41,799
what we got and then finally one

82
00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:43,299
tablespoon of garlic powder let's make

83
00:02:41,799 --> 00:02:44,620
some check-in before we think it started

84
00:02:43,299 --> 00:02:47,139
on the chicken the first thing that I

85
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:49,359
want to do is put my oil into my pot so

86
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:50,799
I can get heated up and ready to fry by

87
00:02:49,359 --> 00:02:53,260
the time that I'm done prepping at the

88
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:53,709
chicken another slight issue that we ran

89
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,389
into

90
00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:56,799
we don't have vegetable oil which is

91
00:02:55,389 --> 00:02:58,780
what you're supposed to fry things in we

92
00:02:56,799 --> 00:03:00,250
only have olive oil so I'm not even sure

93
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:02,769
if this is gonna work to be quite honest

94
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:08,250
with you I feel like a shed so I'm just

95
00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:08,250
way to take my oil hi guys

96
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:23,640
nice olive oil drink we're gonna first

97
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:25,799
do a lot about is it olive oil all the

98
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:28,620
recipe at first said this is exact word

99
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:36,359
cut your thick juicy chicken breasts

100
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:37,799
into straps oh can I open this here

101
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:38,969
those chicken juices everywhere okay

102
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:43,019
we're gonna cut these into some nice

103
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:46,889
strips so we're gonna take our Bowl and

104
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:50,129
some nice natural eggs doesn't the

105
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:53,549
problem mean they're natural really yeah

106
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:54,919
what is the brown egg mean that's what I

107
00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:57,510
meant

108
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:59,730
now what do I do for the buttermilk

109
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:02,099
let's go black or 1 cup of milk into a

110
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:04,650
bowl I'll grab one small fresh lemon or

111
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:05,909
white vinegar this mixture will get us

112
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:07,829
thick and creamy as better enough but it

113
00:04:05,909 --> 00:04:15,930
will perform its role in the batter just

114
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:17,539
as well what about great and one

115
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:20,519
tablespoon of garlic powder

116
00:04:17,539 --> 00:04:21,989
that's how you ask you just like right

117
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,520
like little circular motion it's like

118
00:04:21,989 --> 00:04:25,949
blending eyeshadow now we're going to

119
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:31,110
take our chicken breasts and we're going

120
00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:32,729
to put it in our saw our sauce and the

121
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:34,020
healthy junk food website says that we

122
00:04:32,729 --> 00:04:35,340
need to refrigerate it for two to four

123
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,930
hours so we're gonna go ahead and put

124
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:40,199
this in our refrigerator for two to four

125
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:41,909
minutes cuz I did not and we're gonna

126
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:46,099
make our dry mixture to actually do the

127
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:49,349
fry we need 2 cups of all-purpose flour

128
00:04:46,099 --> 00:04:52,530
1 cup of seasoned breadcrumbs I love

129
00:04:49,349 --> 00:04:54,870
bread crumbs 2 teaspoons of salt and

130
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:57,419
then also treat the 2 teaspoons of salt

131
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:58,770
and then 2 teaspoons of baking powder ok

132
00:04:57,419 --> 00:05:00,360
so now our dry ingredients are all

133
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:02,310
complete so we're gonna get started on

134
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,810
our French fry Kane's fries are really

135
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,770
good but I will say that they're nothing

136
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,970
like crazy

137
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:07,740
I was literally planning on just doing

138
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:09,300
like the frozen crinkle-cut fries that

139
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,909
you can get from the grocery store and

140
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,930
of course those were also missing so

141
00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:16,210
there's gonna be a lot harder than it

142
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:19,539
needed to be I was so sure we had pickle

143
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:33,729
in the fridge right here oh are you

144
00:05:19,539 --> 00:05:35,259
serious a little bit frozen now while

145
00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:37,900
we're ready for the oven to preheat for

146
00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:39,250
our nicely pre-made french fries thank

147
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,349
God I'm gonna work on making it at the

148
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:44,500
Kane's on hopefully my next sentence is

149
00:05:41,349 --> 00:05:46,150
not offend anybody but I don't love King

150
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,949
sauce I'm very much a catch up in

151
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:49,780
barbecue type of girl but I know a lot

152
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:51,550
of people are right or dies and maybe if

153
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:54,960
I make my own it won't be that bad so

154
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:54,960
we're gonna actually try it today

155
00:05:55,470 --> 00:06:01,660

00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:24,749
just leave it Oh turn down the volume or

185
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:28,869
slightly the volume oh wow

186
00:07:24,749 --> 00:07:39,189
once it's smoking here okay

187
00:07:28,869 --> 00:07:41,739
a few moments later oh that is cold it

188
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:45,059
was cooking for one minute I'm gonna go

189
00:07:41,739 --> 00:07:45,059
out on a limb and say your oil burned

190
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:56,139
cut the cameras lay down we have one

191
00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:58,779
chicken breast laughs that is on birds

192
00:07:56,139 --> 00:08:00,519
so we are going to make this our last

193
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:02,529
attempt at making cans before we

194
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:05,259
Livingstone McDonald's which is open

195
00:08:02,529 --> 00:08:07,269
during this course so we found a meat

196
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:48,610
thermometer in our drawer which is great

197
00:08:07,269 --> 00:08:51,490
because in there we're good okay that's

198
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:53,470
a good tender does look pretty good yeah

199
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:55,660
that's what could never go to Remzi

200
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:58,540
shaking Giada home still at home cuz

201
00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:05,769
she's quarantined but I love her this

202
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:07,959
time step which is going to be their

203
00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:09,819
canes toast the best part of the entire

204
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:12,069
meal oh my god I would literally go to

205
00:09:09,819 --> 00:09:13,300
Cannes if it just meant eating the toast

206
00:09:12,069 --> 00:09:14,250
like I'd be completely throw that it's a

207
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,480
full meal in my book

208
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,250
and we're gonna try our best to recreate

209
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,510
it today I don't even think we can get

210
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:21,000
anywhere close I don't know what they

211
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:24,780
bake it way that it must be magic for

212
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,190
rich rot so so we have our two slices of

213
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,540
bread and Kane's bread is known for

214
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,700
being a both like really really sweet

215
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:31,170
and salty at the same time so our bread

216
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:33,930
is of course a little bit salty and we

217
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:35,670
got some garlic flavored infused extra

218
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:37,320
virgin olive oil I'm just going to put

219
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:39,870
into here so it's gonna take a little

220
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:43,140
cooking a brush what is this like a nice

221
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:45,120
like a c-47 seven products crab some

222
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:47,280
butter from the tub really brush it on

223
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,230
there giving the bread a nice coating

224
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,640
perhaps a stippling motion for all you

225
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:54,180
makeup lovers out there a little bit of

226
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,980
extra virgin olive oil extra virgin just

227
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,970
like me unfortunately and lots of

228
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,950
Pauline at least we're gonna pop our

229
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:02,010
bread into the oven to toast for like

230
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:03,680
four to five ish to eight depending on

231
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:08,430
how long this takes to cook with it so

232
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:10,770
dunno alright you guys we are finally

233
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:12,540
done that with this Kane's DIY meal

234
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:14,460
contrary to the blog that we read it did

235
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:16,470
not take fourteen minutes but rather two

236
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:18,330
hours time for the taste test this was a

237
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:19,800
roller coaster to get here but I will

238
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:22,200
see the finished plate in front of us

239
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:26,220
looks like no that bad let's try the

240
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:27,480

french fry whatever I will see your

242
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,440

00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:34,560
the first time everything but this one

244
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:37,940
looks okay take a look inside fully

245
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:41,259
