00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,780
hi sisters James Charles here and

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:05,160
welcome back to my youtube channel so it

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,899
is officially fall season it is the end

4
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,210
of November and you know what that means

5
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:10,320
it's Thanksgiving I personally love

6
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,059
Thanksgiving it is one of my all-time

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,799
favorite holidays I have not been home

8
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:16,109
in over six months now since my senior

9
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:18,300
graduation so I am literally so pumped

10
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:20,369
for once to hop on a plane and fly all

11
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,900
the way back home to regular old open in

12
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:23,880
New York and see my family I literally

13
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,920
missed them so so much I cannot wait to

14
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,590
give momma Charles and sister Ian and

15
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,560
daddy Charles a oh whoa

16
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:33,239
no oooh and father Charles that was

17
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,980
almost really really bad I'm associated

18
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:36,660
to get them all really really big hugs

19
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,710
the point of Thanksgiving is obviously

20
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,210
to spend time with your family and

21
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,370
friends and be thankful and of course

22
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,660
eat a lot of really really great food

23
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,739
I've been getting so many treats from

24
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,730
you guys telling me that you guys are

25
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:46,020

26
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,840

you have not seen in so so long so for

28
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,110
today's look I put together this funky

29
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,760
little cut crease moment perfect for the

30
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:56,280
Thanksgiving feast and it's like the

31
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,350
smokey winged out bronzy little fall

32
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,660
moment we have bronze glitter on the lid

33
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,280
and some very very intense fluffy lashes

34
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,780
I just wanted to go very very extra

00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,990

00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,430

47
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,890
right and this eye look is simply gonna

48
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,450
be pretty complicated and definitely a

49
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,130
lot going on today just like our

50
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,450
Thanksgiving dinner plates we got the

51
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:36,030
stuffing at the mashed potatoes the

52
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,619
gravy the turkey and the whole shebang

53
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:40,170
so I'm gonna be using the brand new

54
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:41,579
Morpheus 39a dare to create palette I

55
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,990
absolutely love this palette I can't

56
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:44,460
with the holiday collection that I

57
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:46,619
modeled for if you guys have not yet

58
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:49,049
seen my full-on review definitely click

59
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:50,759
somewhere up here I think if this is the

60
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:53,430
right side fingers crossed

61
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:54,960
to check that video out I first got my

62
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:56,729
m4 for one brush and dip into this

63
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,200
middle transition shade I actually lost

64
00:01:56,729 --> 00:01:59,640
a little sheet with the names on it so

65
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,439
you're just gonna have to bear with me

66
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,460
today I'm just popping the shade right

67
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,229
up in the crease and blending it out

68
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,939
using windshield wiper motions and I'm

69
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:07,409
actually not topping off the brush

70
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:09,119
before I find this color we definitely

71
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:11,129
want this to be a very very vibrant and

72
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,470
pigmented and when we get to the outer

73
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:13,850
corner I am doing my all-time

74
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:16,970
favorite trick upholding that shadow out

75
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:18,860
a little bit for the next color we're

76
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:21,110
gonna grab at our 39 brush and dip into

77
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:22,790
this burnt orange shade right up in here

78
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:24,050
I'm topping the shade right up in the

79
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:25,610
crease and normally what I would do

80
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:28,090
crease shade I would always hold the

81
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:30,590
brush like this completely parallel or

82
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:32,300
horizontal there we go to my face but

83
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:34,070
for this I'm actually kind of holding

84
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,030
the brush downwards to really get it up

85
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,190
in that crease and make sure it doesn't

86
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:38,750
blend any higher we are gonna be cutting

87
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,950
out the crease today so it's okay for

88
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,540
everything gets on the lid because we're

89
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:42,740
gonna clean it up later and then same

90
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:44,780
thing with that outer corner I'm gonna

91
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:51,530
pull it out and like a nice little cut

92
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:52,970
v-shape we are gonna be going from

93
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:54,590
really really light orange obviously in

94
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:56,990
our transition to really really deep

95
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:58,550
black in the crease area which you'll

96
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:59,870
see in a few seconds but I am gonna be

97
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:01,310
blending in between every snap to make

98
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:05,510
sure that none of the colors get muddied

99
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:07,490
it together I'm Mexican I grab another

100
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:09,470
clean r39 brush this brush is basically

101
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:10,040
the exact same was the M 4-3-3 so if you

102
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,450
have that one

103
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,800
feel free to dip into that one too or

104
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:15,110
literally any blending brush it's really

105
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,090
not that deep to this and burnt darker

106
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:18,350
orange shade right up in here but we are

107
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:20,120
just gonna want make sure every color we

108
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:22,489
go and we're using a smaller brush or

109
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,450
just a more defined motion to really

110
00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:25,100
make sure that those colors are getting

111
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:26,930
more and more dark and defined with each

112
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,550
time and once again not getting to money

113
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:31,220
on next thing I got was smaller more

114
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:33,080
defined brush this is the M 507 and I'm

115
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:35,480
gonna dip into this like ready tone

116
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:37,310
brown shade up in here and I'm gonna use

117
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,260
this to deepen up once again the crease

118
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:40,580
and the outer V as you guys can see when

119
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,140
doing these style of looks it's really

120
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:43,700
really important to start off light and

121
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:45,560
build your way up darker and darker

122
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:47,420
using a smaller and smaller brush and

123
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,769
smaller motions each time because if you

124
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,330
start off with a dark color and just go

125
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:52,430
right in everything it's gonna look

126
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:54,830
really really wonky and unblended like

127
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:56,570
really really quickly so I know it may

128
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:57,920
seem like a lot of extremis I mean we've

129
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,060
already literally use for eyeshadow

130
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,430
colors and this doesn't even look like

131
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:03,019
much it yet but if you just take your

132
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:04,400
time and be patient this is really gonna

133
00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:05,959
like help you with your makeup in

134
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,850
general just starting off really really

135
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:10,010
slow and having patience will help you

136
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:11,900
make those iconic beautiful blend it out

137
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:13,190
smokey eyes so this is where things are

138
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,080
going to start to get more complicated

139
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:17,060
more dark and more intense I'm gonna

140
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:19,250
grab my m14 9 brush which is this very

141
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,959
very tiny pencil brush and dip into the

142
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:23,120
black shade in the bottom corner and

143
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,370
uses to deepen out crease

144
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,139
or the outer V not the crease oh my god

145
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:28,310
I just brought my mirror a little bit

146
00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:29,870
closer obviously you guys know my

147
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,710
eyesight is not the pest I really want

148
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:33,020
to make sure that this is very very

149
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:34,520
defined and precise cuz you guys know

150
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:36,050
adding a little bit too much block and

151
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:38,630
make an eye look go from real good to

152
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:39,530
real bad real fast so excuse the mirror

153
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:41,180
in the video I'm gonna move it in a

154
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:42,800
second so with the block on the pencil

155
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,500
brush I'm gonna take this and I'm gonna

156
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,970
top it right into the outer of V we're

157
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,430
gonna cut this entire area out using a

158
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:50,540
shimmer shadow in a second but I do want

159
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:52,610
to get all the color on there in the

160
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:54,139
right shape just like that so we can

161
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:55,940
blend it out at how the pigment still be

162
00:04:54,139 --> 00:04:57,680
there because like I said we don't want

163
00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:00,380
to add too much block but where there is

164
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,889
the block we want it to be black if that

165
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,479
makes sense

166
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:04,250
to blend that black out I'm gonna grab

167
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,830
Miami five up seven brush once again and

168
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:08,479
dip into this cool tone a brown shade up

169
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:10,310
in here and just lightly go over those

170
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,930
edges like I was saying adding a little

171
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:14,660
bit of black and quickly get too intense

172
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:16,220
and I think this definitely just did so

173
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:17,870
I'm gonna go to my r39 brush and dip

174
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,310
into that light orange shade from before

175
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:20,990
and just go over those edges to

176
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:23,120
hopefully make everything a little bit

177
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:24,380
less dark alright so that is the lid all

178
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,940
complete like I said it did get a little

179
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:28,010
bit darker than I originally wanted it

180
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:29,360
to but oh well I guess that's just what

181
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:30,349
we're gonna have to deal with today now

182
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,150
we're gonna go ahead and cut out the

183
00:05:30,349 --> 00:05:33,889
crease I'm gonna grab my morphe cream

184
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:35,360
shadow in the shade copper today which

185
00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:37,660
is this beautiful orange shade as the

186
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,310
base of course and then my makeup shock

187
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:42,139
t57 brush it's just this tiny really

188
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:43,550
flat definer brush we are gonna be doing

189
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:45,500
a lot more of like a detailed crease

190
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:46,490
today than the classic average half cut

191
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,050
crease where you just kind of blur out

192
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:49,910
the edges so I do want to make sure it's

193
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:50,780
really really light and defined I know

194
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:52,039
some people really like to do a

195
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,900
concealer first when they're cutting out

196
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:55,160
creases but if you're using a pigmented

197
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,120
cream shadow I feel like it's really not

198
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,979
that deep because you're just gonna

199
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,320
cover over top of it anyway and it does

200
00:05:57,979 --> 00:06:02,479
the same job so like why do you more

201
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,620
work if you don't have to you feel once

202
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,090
again talk about the mir but I'm gonna

203
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:07,220
lean in close early make sure I get this

204
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:10,010
exactly where I want it I'm just going

205
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:11,060
to carve out this crease I'm just

206
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:13,039
wanting to send like normal but then

207
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:14,270
once I get to the outer corner instead

208
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,800
of just fading out the edges I'm

209
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,070
actually gonna pull this shout out once

210
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,900
again

211
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:19,970
when that defined brush and I'm gonna

212
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:22,430
make kind of a loop back around to the

213
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:23,599
lower lash line this more rounded define

214
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:25,010
cut crease is a look that I've been

215
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:27,020
seeing a ton of people rock on Instagram

216
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:28,190
lately but I've never actually tried so

217
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,750
I just wanted to test that out today and

218
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:31,400
honestly I think it looks so stunning

219
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:33,600
and really really cool and definitely

220
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,190
adds a more like avant-garde twist

221
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,170
to the door euler half cut crease just

222
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:38,520
for an extra little pop on top I'm gonna

223
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:40,290
grab the Stila liquid metals and the

224
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,490
shade of bronze bell and just Pat a

225
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:44,670
little bit of this over top of that

226
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:45,930
morphe cream eyeshadow I really want to

227
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,580
make sure this is dried down before I go

228
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:49,320
in with any more shadow or anything else

229
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:52,590
obviously we don't any of that shadow to

230
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:53,760
transfer so the last and final step of

231
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:55,380
my upper lash line today is actually

232
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,450
gonna be to grab the Kat Von D tattoo

233
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:59,070
liner in the shade of trooper and I'm

234
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:01,110
gonna really lightly outline at that

235
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:02,550
outer curve for lashes today I'm gonna

236
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:05,180
pop out a pair of how's the lashes

237
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,180
ikonics

238
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:09,780
then I'm just gonna blend together my

239
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:11,130
real lashes with the fake ones of course

240
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,020
using my benefit roller lash mascara

241
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:14,640
once the lashes are blended together I'm

242
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:16,680
gonna grab a black liner pencil and you

243
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:18,060
guys know I hate doing this but for

244
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,350
today's look I filet it as necessary I

245
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,370
really want this to be very very sexy

246
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:21,630
and sultry

247
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:23,010
I want everybody other things doing

248
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:25,440
doing our table to know that I am that

249
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:29,360
[ __ ] that gets the turkey first I

250
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,360
really wanna be nice and intense

251
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,960
it's been a long time since I've done

252
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,520
that whoa

253
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,990
for the lower last I'm gonna grab an

254
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,880
hour 30 and I'm brush and dip into the

255
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:42,680
bright orange shade and just run that

256
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,940
all around the lower lash and then of

257
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:47,000
course I can sort of connect it at that

258
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:48,140
outer corner I'm gonna take my Beauty

259
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,520
Blender and dip into a little bit of my

260
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:52,190
chances at setting powder and I'm going

261
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,270
to bake right underneath that shadow

262
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:54,950
because I think it's getting a little

263
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:57,710
bit too low there and like I said we do

264
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:59,270
want to keep this very very defined just

265
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:01,070
like that I'm just gonna grab any flat

266
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,540
top brush and I'm gonna dip into the

267
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:03,650
already brown shade and I'm gonna run

268
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:06,260
that along the lower lash

269
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:08,240
Wow finally I'm just gonna grab a flat

270
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:10,100
top rounded brush and use this to

271
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,990
highlight my brow bone using of course

272
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:15,350
what other than my Anasazi illuminator

273
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:16,700
and so Hollywood then same thing on a

274
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:18,380
pencil brush in that inner corner

275
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,340
alright guys Metis one eye all complete

276
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,570
I'm gonna go ahead and do the other one

277
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:22,010
off-camera quickly and I'll be right

278
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:23,840
back to finish off the rest of the lock

279
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:25,370
alright guys and those are both eyes all

280
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,600
complete I actually ended up taking off

281
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:28,220
the electronics and switching them out

282
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,900
for the Lily lashes in the style Sydney

283
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:31,520
these are much more intense and

284
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,140
voluminous not gonna lie my eyes are a

285
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,610
little bit on code right now you guys

286
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:36,200
know I always do have to cut off a lot

287
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:38,390
of lash to make them work my eyes are

288
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,919
very very tiny but I feel like the

289
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:41,780
dramatic Ness and the size of these just

290
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,700
really fits at this look so sister it's

291
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:44,750
gonna suck it up I already added a

292
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,130
little bit of highlighter earlier but I

293
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,510
feel like we are definitely not blending

294
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:49,370
enough I mean I'm trying to be on the

295
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:50,900
level of like aunt josephine is grabbing

296
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:52,580
for the stuffing and we're like BAM and

297
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,630
she is literally so shocked that she

298
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,970
forgets about what she was doing and

299
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:57,260
then we get to snatch it up first I'm

300
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:59,570
gonna go in and lightly spritz my face

301
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:01,040
using the tatcha dewy skin mist just to

302
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:04,730
give the highlight or something to stick

303
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:06,860
to and then I'm gonna grab of course

304
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:08,570
you've gassed in my honest Asya so

305
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:10,490
Hollywood illuminator Oh

306
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:12,380
aunt Josephine is literally shaking she

307
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:13,580
just fell over alright guys and to

308
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:15,110
finish off this look today I'm gonna go

309
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:16,970
into the anasazi liquid lipstick in the

310
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:18,470
shade its sepia I'm not used as lip

311
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:19,970
color and so long but I felt like you

312
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:21,350
would pair perfectly with this look I

313
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:22,880
use it a few days ago for a chocolate

314
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:24,800
and I literally fell back in love with

315
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,060
it it is the kind of a brownie mouth

316
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,650
tone but it definitely does have some

317
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:29,150
purpley undertones which matched

318
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,350
perfectly with the reds in the eye look

319
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:32,540
today and I just like it pairs perfectly

320
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:33,770
for this fall look and finally to finish

321
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:35,600
this off I'm just gonna give my face a

322
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:38,200
good spritz using the Scandinavia makeup

323
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,200
finishing spray

324
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:43,079
