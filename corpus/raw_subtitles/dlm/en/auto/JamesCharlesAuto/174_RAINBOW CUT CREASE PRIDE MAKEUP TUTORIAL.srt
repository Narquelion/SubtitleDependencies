00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:27,260
[Music]

5
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:32,940
this past weekend here in Los Angeles

6
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:34,290
was the annual Pride Parade I am so

7
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,420
honored and proud to be part of the

8
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,370
LGBTQ community it is such an amazing

9
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,070
place to be but unfortunately I did not

10
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:42,510
get to actually go to the parade as you

11
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,670
guys know I did just moved to Los

12
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,110
Angeles and I was so looking forward to

13
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,489
going to the first-ever pride event

14
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,350
I have never actually been to one before

15
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:51,450
so I was so pumped toward like some glam

16
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,190
makeup and meet a ton of you guys but I

17
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:55,620
had something a little bit more

18
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:57,030
important to do that weekend I was

19
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,440
actually shooting a very very exciting

20
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,970
campaign commercial that I cannot talk

21
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,860
to you guys about just yet

22
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:04,259
but I promise you'll be finding out very

23
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:06,750
very soon but being said however it was

24
00:01:04,259 --> 00:01:08,550
and prior to baste commercial and I was

25
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,979
wearing this look for the shooting I

26
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:12,149
posted on Instagram and snapchat so many

27
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:14,460
of you guys aren't crazy over this

28
00:01:12,149 --> 00:01:16,229
rainbow cut crease prime and spine look

29
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,970
I have to miss makeup a total of five

30
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:19,560
times out and after number four on the

31
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,119
set for the commercial I literally

32
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,820
tweeted saying I would never ever ever

33
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,830
to a rainbow cut crease ever again but

34
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,760
so many of you guys asked for tutorial

35
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,350
on this and it was something that was

36
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:30,030
very very hard to explain this is

37
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:32,580
definitely a very very intricate look so

38
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,740
I figured let me just suck it up put it

39
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:36,869
back on for the fifth and final time and

40
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,860
film a freaking tutorial

41
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:39,000
that being said that this look is

42
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,560
definitely not the easiest thing in the

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,360
world it's definitely pretty tricky and

44
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,460
extravagant so I definitely just go into

45
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,810
James tutorial mode and teach you guys

46
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,520
these little techniques and tricks that

47
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,320
I use to get this look so if you want to

48
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,909
see how I created this rainbow pride cut

49
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,619
crease make sure you keep on watching

50
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:54,210
all right babes so I'm starting off with

51
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:56,790
my face and eyebrows already completely

52
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:58,890
on and done this look is very very

53
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,180
focused on the eye region obviously so I

54
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:02,130
don't want to take too long on the base

55
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,780
I just use my makeup primer ultra HD

56
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:05,580
stick and then my turn shape tape as

57
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,130
always my Laura Mercier and then my

58
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:10,170
benefit brow products so just a normal

59
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:11,459
routine like always every single video

60
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,410
and now let's just go ahead and move

61
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:14,940
right on with the eyes and get into the

62
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,200
glam I already went ahead and Pat my

63
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,940
eyelids using some concealer and then

64
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,799
some loose powder and the first part I'm

65
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,480
gonna go often is my morphe 35n palette

66
00:02:19,799 --> 00:02:22,750
of course any ways that you can use code

67
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,340
Jase or 10% off your

68
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,810
yes this problem is my all-time favorite

69
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:28,180
develop that I used to my colorful looks

70
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:30,160
as you can see it is very very used and

71
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:31,240
damaged but as my holder krill that I'm

72
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,890
gonna start with this angle brush I'll

73
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,510
just dip into the yellow shade down in

74
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:36,700
the bottom to start sketching out my

75
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:38,470
crease so you guys know my cut crease I

76
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,000
do do that a little bit of a strange way

77
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:42,190
and that as I sketch out of the crease

78
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,170
first and then gotten with the shadows

79
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:45,640
and went upward after this is not a very

80
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:47,980
very common technique but it's what

81
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:50,110
works best for me so follow it don't

82
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:52,210
follow it that's on you to decide sister

83
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:53,740
YouTube you this is just my eyelid

84
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:54,940
crease I wonder if this works really

85
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,950
really well for me just because it gives

86
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:58,570
me a really really good guideline when

87
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:00,760
it comes to the concealer I can just

88
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:01,660
super easily cut it right in half and I

89
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,250
don't have to really worry about like

90
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:05,050
shaping or anything like that I don't

91
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,940
know this is my personal favorite and

92
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:09,220
then I'm going to use the same exact

93
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,810
brush and I'm gonna dip into the orange

94
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:15,130
shade and kind of place that in the

95
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:16,870
middle of the cut crease and then with

96
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:22,900
that same exact brush dipping right into

97
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:29,350
the red and then finally winging that

98
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:30,820
out using the bright pink shade when I

99
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:32,170
sketch out my cut crease as you can see

100
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,459
I do got a little bit of hooded eye it's

101
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,260
when I look shape for it at the camera

102
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:37,330
there's not much actual lid space you

103
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:38,680
can see so when I draw my crease in I

104
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:40,510
really like to go above my natural

105
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,920
crease or what I look for it you can

106
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:44,110
still see pretty much all the cut crease

107
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,310
this just once again my style you don't

108
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:46,510
have to do this I know a lot of people

109
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:48,730
like to put their concrete in their

110
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:51,160
actual crate you spin that into say cut

111
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:52,299
crease you get what I'm saying

112
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,650
put your diffic a star ever you want it

113
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:54,850
personally I've heard a draw above the

114
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:57,010
crease and I feel like this gives a deep

115
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:58,840
best result but once again you do you

116
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:00,280
next I'm gonna go away I'm four three

117
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,840
three brush and dip right back into that

118
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,040
yellow shade and I'm just gonna really

119
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:09,250
focus this clear right on the inner

120
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:10,840
corner of that crease area that's great

121
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,820
my morphe amma one five one brush

122
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,470
dipping into my Anasazi a-blazing single

123
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:16,030
shadow i'm going to use this color and

124
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:17,650
I'm going to keep it up the orange part

125
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:18,940
of the crease I'm just going right in

126
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:21,299
where I drew that original crease line

127
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:23,490
and darkening up the bottom a portion of

128
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:25,500
not Creed's just to create a little bit

129
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:27,090
more dimension and then carving another

130
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,949
and 4:33 brush I'm gonna dip into the

131
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:34,139
bright orange a to the 35b palette and

132
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:36,900
blend that out next we're gonna have a

133
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:38,610
clean a morphe m151 brush again and dip

134
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,800
into my jeffree star and drogyny palette

135
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:42,000
and the shade fetish same thing with the

136
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,770
orange I'm just placing this cloth at

137
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,330
the bottom of that crease line from

138
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:47,330
before just to create some dimension

139
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:52,289
bang carving another m33 burps I'm going

140
00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:55,520
to dip into that red shake from the 35b

141
00:04:52,289 --> 00:04:58,280
palette and I'm going to blend that out

142
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,539
[Music]

143
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,710
and then finally with one less I'm four

144
00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:03,630
three three I'm going to dip into the

145
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:07,250
bright pink shade and just blend out the

146
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:07,250
outside of that line and smoke it out

147
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:15,099
and those are all the colors are already

148
00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:16,690
on there like I told you guys the

149
00:05:15,099 --> 00:05:17,530
segment yes super easy and definitely my

150
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:19,300
favorite I've been doing it since

151
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:21,039
beginning if you have not tried this

152
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:23,259
technique to do a concrete definitely a

153
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,490
ton of Ted water go ahead just try it

154
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:25,840
let me know what you think at least I

155
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,280
promise you will not regret it

156
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,569
but that being said as you can see

157
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,340
there's already a super easy guide

158
00:05:28,569 --> 00:05:31,900
already drawn out because we sketch it

159
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,800
out originally but now just to clean it

160
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,449
up I'm gonna go back and buy a

161
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,729
heart-shaped Cape concealer em I have a

162
00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:38,139
makeup shock t-80 sticks brush and I'm

163
00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:42,729
just going to clean up that line I'm

164
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:45,610
just going to slowly trace right

165
00:05:42,729 --> 00:05:47,710
underneath that crease line being really

166
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:49,659
careful not to mess it up because that

167
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:50,800
blending is already looking a bomb

168
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:53,319
oh yeah I think we don't have to go

169
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,789
around and we do it so I'm just tracing

170
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:56,229
the bottom of that line and driving it

171
00:05:54,789 --> 00:05:57,969
right into the inner corner and then

172
00:05:56,229 --> 00:06:00,370
with a new job uh concealer and down

173
00:05:57,969 --> 00:06:01,539
onto the eyelid just set that concealer

174
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:03,190
at replacing just to brighten up the

175
00:06:01,539 --> 00:06:05,110
island itself and get ready for it the

176
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:07,750
liner I'm just gonna use the makeup shot

177
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:11,129
t6 brush in the white shade in the 35b

178
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:11,129
and just packing it right on there

179
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,830
for awaiting today I can use my Kat Von

180
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:22,389
D tattoo and locket Lila this is my

181
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:22,389
all-time favorite winged liner

182
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:38,039
now looking at this this wing is

183
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:40,229
definitely way bigger than normal but

184
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:41,939
keep in mind it is a very very large cut

185
00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:43,529
crease almost like drag style makeup

186
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:45,210
look so we definitely want to try to

187
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:46,499
balance it out at least a little bit

188
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:48,090
when it comes to the Atlanta because

189
00:06:46,499 --> 00:06:49,860
this would look very very shake there's

190
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:52,349
a huge boat on crease and then a tiny

191
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:54,060
little baby baby wings so once again a

192
00:06:52,349 --> 00:06:55,590
theme of this video do what you want but

193
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,539
this stuff to the style that I feel like

194
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:58,199
well the best for this look and just

195
00:06:57,539 --> 00:07:00,509
what I came up with

196
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:02,610
honestly this wing is ready to cut a

197
00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:04,409
[ __ ] I am living for it let's go ahead

198
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:05,279
and move on for my bottom lash I have

199
00:07:04,409 --> 00:07:06,840
today I'm first gonna start off by

200
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:08,729
letting my waterline using the Mac

201
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:11,159
fascinating.i Kohl pencil

202
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:13,409
I love the formula it is so creamy and

203
00:07:11,159 --> 00:07:14,849
smooth and doesn't irritate my eyes you

204
00:07:13,409 --> 00:07:18,569
guys know that I'm really really not a

205
00:07:14,849 --> 00:07:20,879
fan of honestly been kind of skip me on

206
00:07:18,569 --> 00:07:22,500
that stuff recently but this firmware is

207
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:24,150
one that doesn't irritate me and for

208
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,219
this look at that really looks super

209
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:27,599
cute to have a little bit of white in

210
00:07:26,219 --> 00:07:29,009
the inner corner just to open up the

211
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,870
eyes make them look a little bit bigger

212
00:07:29,009 --> 00:07:32,639
a little more for the little pump

213
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:35,129
because we are to be gluing some

214
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,810
Swarovski crystals in there too so I'm

215
00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:38,610
just gonna use this to really brighten

216
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:40,650
up that lower lash line and get ready

217
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:42,479
for a whole lot of color for the first

218
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:45,900
color on my waterline I'm gonna grab you

219
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:47,639
guessed it the morphe 35n white m33

220
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,620
brush and I'm just gonna dip into this

221
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:51,659
sky blue shade up in the top right

222
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:53,009
corner I'm just focusing this color

223
00:07:51,659 --> 00:07:54,960
right on the center of the lower lash

224
00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:56,789
line and blending it lightly out to the

225
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,979
left and the right I definitely didn't

226
00:07:56,789 --> 00:08:00,089
want to take the shadow too low down or

227
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:02,129
else it's gonna really accentuate those

228
00:08:00,089 --> 00:08:03,479
eye bags but I am being careful just to

229
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:05,879
make sure it is still blown out because

230
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:07,560
we don't want a SuperDuper harsh line

231
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:10,199
that is boys against the rules when it

232
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:13,199
comes to makeup with sister J Nexen I go

233
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:15,300
back in with a 35 B and my Sigma e55

234
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,560
eyes shading brush this is just a a flat

235
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,810
definer brush that I'm just gonna dip

236
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,520
into this bright green shade right up in

237
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:21,870
here and I'm just gonna place this in

238
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:25,129
the inner corner or right underneath

239
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:25,129
that white shadow

240
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,090
out of all the colors in the rainbow

241
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:32,190
green is probably my least favorite

242
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:33,600
color so like I was saying personal

243
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:35,580
preference I'm gonna probably use the

244
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:37,230
least amount of green shadow and best

245
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,820
luck and I'm just gonna really focus

246
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:40,380
this right on the inner corner and

247
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:42,300
there's gonna hot pocket of my blue

248
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:45,620
blending brush and make sure that those

249
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:47,700
shades are very well blended together

250
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:50,130
for the last clone I'm gonna grab Miami

251
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,600
5 6 - a tiny tapered blending brush and

252
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,760
dip right into this with right ass

253
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,500
purple to finish off the lower lash line

254
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,820
I'm just taking this purple shade and

255
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,950
I'm putting it right in the outer corner

256
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,690
on the outer third of the lid pulling

257
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:02,370
into the blue a little bit and then just

258
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:07,860
pulling it up and out and blending it

259
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:09,060
into the bottom of that wing then to

260
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:11,250
finish off the eye look I'm gonna grab a

261
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:17,160
UH Swarovski crystal and the size 14 and

262
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:18,330
just pop her right on to deny that are

263
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:26,340
you just stopped my last sentence

264
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:28,020
midweek I apologize I just popped on a

265
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:29,730
Swarovski crystal on the size number 14

266
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:32,730
using a tiny dollop of flash fill in the

267
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:34,230
inner corner hmm I'm so sorry about that

268
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:35,640
now we're gonna move on with the lashes

269
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:37,830
and for today I'm using the house lash

270
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,720
psychotics as always I always love these

271
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:42,540
for crazy so I'm just going to glue her

272
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,830
right on then to finish off this eye

273
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,390
look I'm just gonna use my benefit

274
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:47,010
roller lash mascara you guys know this

275
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:48,840
is my all-time babe just to blend

276
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:51,320
together my fake lashes with my aren't

277
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,320
real ones

278
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:58,530
alright guys that is one prayin rainbow

279
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:59,910
cut crease I all complete I'm gonna

280
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:01,260
gonna do the one off-camera now just

281
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:04,170
save some time and I'll be right back

282
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:05,370
okay finish off the rest of the face all

283
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:07,140
right we'll be right along for blush

284
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:10,770
that I'm gonna use the Mac dolly mix

285
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:13,650
blush with my morphe okay this has no

286
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:14,970
name on it so this brush I am packing

287
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:17,640
the blush a little bit heavier than

288
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:20,490
normal today for James Krause I like oh

289
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:22,680
this is definitely not my usual luck but

290
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:24,420
I'm using a pink highlighter today and

291
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,420
for the commercial that I shot this for

292
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:28,590
they really wanted a very very intense

293
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:30,720
private that would show well my camera

294
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:32,100
so this is just exactly what I did once

295
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,100
again if you don't want to wear that

296
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:36,720
much blush you do use this terms this is

297
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,530
getting so annoying I apologize and

298
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,700
therefore highlighters today I'm going

299
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,780
to use the Eclipse highlighter from a

300
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,150
Jeffrey's are in collaboration with

301
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:45,270
Mandy MUA I freaking love this thing it

302
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:46,470
is so blinding pull and I'm just gonna

303
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,310
lay out right over top of that blush so

304
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:53,550
it gives a little bit of a pink

305
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:55,320
iridescent glow I'm also poppin is how

306
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:57,750
later right onto the brow bone for a

307
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,400
little bit more glow up there then I'm

308
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:01,380
just wrapping i'm 4:33 angle right over

309
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:04,440
that line between the two just make sure

310
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:05,430
that however is not too defined we're

311
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,500
just saying that I never thought I would

312
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:09,240
send my tan line but we just want to

313
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,740
settle down that glow just the slightest

314
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,840
bit to make sure they're evenly blended

315
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,850
between the highlight the brow and like

316
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,260
the red crease to finish this look off

317
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:17,880
my lips today I'm gonna use the over

318
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:19,680
liquid lipstick in the shade at Pasadena

319
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,330
I felt like a nude lip was it definitely

320
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,280
necessary for this look just being that

321
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:25,200
if I'd chose any a bright color it would

322
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,520
probably a really really unbalanced the

323
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,900
eye look I didn't want to like a red or

324
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,940
anything because then there'd be too

325
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:31,110
much red or like a blue you get what I

326
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,850
mean I feel like they need to be the

327
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:34,560
perfect happy medium between all three

328
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:36,330
and Pasadena so my all-time faves and

329
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,130

all right and to finish this look off

333
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,720
once and for all I'm gonna drench myself

334
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:44,280
in the Urban Decay all nighter setting

335
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,990
spray if you're gonna be wearing this

336
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,580
look to a prime event is gonna be very

337
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:49,650
very hot probably very very sweaty and

338
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:50,880
probably very brief item celebratory so

339
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:55,190
you definitely gonna make sure you lock

340
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,190
