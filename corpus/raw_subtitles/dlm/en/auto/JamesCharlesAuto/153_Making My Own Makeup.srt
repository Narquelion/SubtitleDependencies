it is currently 6:00 in the morning and

4
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,639

you keep filling YouTube videos this

6
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,630
early I'm also wondering the same thing

7
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:17,400
for today's video we were going on a

8
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:18,119
road trip I wish I never did that oh my

9
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,760
god

10
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:23,939
today we together are going to be going

11
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,619
on a little bit of a road trip I am so

12
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:27,449
beyond excited because we're you going

13
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:29,730
somewhere very very special and for

14
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:32,130
today's video I'm going to be doing a

15
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:35,160
full face of makeup using makeup that I

16
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:37,530
am about to make so I've been evita guru

17
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,329
for about three very very long years at

18
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,620
this point and thanks to you guys I've

19
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:42,570
actually been able to turn up pinenut

20
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:45,090
makeup into a full-time job and I still

21
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,440
pinch myself every single day at this

22
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,910
point you guys see me pretty much to

23
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,800
every single makeup look in the book

24
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:52,469
from classic everyday glam to crazy

25
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,460
rainbow avant-garde realness but even

26
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,989
though my job is to play with these

27
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,629
makeup products and create art with them

28
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:59,730
on my face I really don't know that much

29
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:01,320
about what actually goes in to making

30
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:02,550
makeup so for today's video I thought

31
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,769
it'd be a really really fun and

32
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:07,020
educational to go behind the scenes and

33
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:08,610
I partnered with colour-pop cosmetics a

34
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,229
brand that you and I obviously know and

35
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,330
love and we're going to taking a

36
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:14,610
hour-long road trip over to Oxnard

37
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,540
California literally in the middle of

38
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,490
nowhere but that is where their

39
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,990
laboratory is located luckily after a

40
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,430
whole lotta convincing colour-pop was

41
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,049
kind enough to let me and my entire

42
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,180
camera crew go behind the scenes and

43
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:26,159
show you guys what actually goes on in

44
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,990
these labs and we're going to be making

45
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,759
a full face of makeup setting the

46
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,960
foundation that anyway lip gloss and

47
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,369
hopefully we'll be able to come up with

48
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,930
a really really beautiful look and the

49
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:35,220
end and give you guys a little bit more

50
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:37,049
information on the products that we're

51
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,790
all using every single day we have a

52
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:39,960
very long car ride and day ahead of us

53
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,579
so I'm going to quickly go hop in the

54
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,520
shower and get ready for the day this

55
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:45,869
bed head is not cute but I am so beyond

56
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,650
excited for what's to come so without

57
00:01:45,869 --> 00:02:06,040
further ado let's go make some makeup

58
00:01:49,650 --> 00:02:08,149

61
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:17,979
[Music]

00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:30,230
let's do it afterwards basically we own

64
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:31,570
like nine buildings like oh this is

65
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:34,940
gorgeous

66
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:36,830
hello feed me it seriously obviously I

67
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:38,090
do makeup every single day as a job but

68
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:40,670
like I've never really been a part of

69
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:42,500
like the actual production process for

70
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:44,360
and like school came pretty easy to me

71
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,070
about science and math or I to like

72
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,440
favorite subjects of all time I actually

73
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:49,520
really liked chemistry so I'm like

74
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,010
excited today

75
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,270
loke a little bit to like learn more

76
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,709
about it and like see what actually goes

77
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:57,980
into the products that I use on an

78
00:02:54,709 --> 00:03:00,230
everyday basis yeah all those food

79
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:02,440
stations they are like so prep they're

80
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,440
ready

81
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:12,560
how long is called mob-like been around

82
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,049
and manufacturing here so it started

83
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,370
maybe like five six years ago as like a

84
00:03:15,049 --> 00:03:19,459
little idea

85
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:21,110
so spats lavatories used to like

86
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:22,940
manufacture for like all the big makeup

87
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,980
brands that you know of and the owners

88
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:26,080
now draw more

89
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,310
over there decided like why don't we

90
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,830
just launched our own brands like we

91
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:31,060
know how to make up no they like came up

92
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:33,670
with the idea of color pop they

93
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:35,860
literally like used to have their office

94
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:37,989
in like a closet so it was like this

95
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:39,549
tiny little room and they would like go

96
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:41,410
make the makeup and they like pack the

97
00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:44,230
order and then they'd like drive it to

98
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:46,000
the post office oh my god those muscley

99
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:48,940
grown from like a tiny little like

100
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,720
closet to this full-on like nine

101
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:53,950
building facility yeah that's everything

102
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:56,950
so color pop manufactures everything

103
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:57,849
right here in California in the US so

104
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,170
just like one of the major selling

105
00:03:57,849 --> 00:04:01,060
points I feel like for a collar pop

106
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:04,239
makeup having everything in house means

107
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:05,980
things are faster so if a trend comes

108
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,760
out later that day like the lab will

109
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,760
have samples for us

110
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,700
oh my biggest thing I'm working with any

111
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:17,109
Brian is I'm very very impatient someone

112
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:19,060
I want to do that like well let's take

113
00:04:17,109 --> 00:04:20,799
us Stefan's like I want it now so who

114
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:25,380
does it so fast it'll be right there

115
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:25,380
yeah like literally we've done overnight

116
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:29,650
so I feel like one of the other major

117
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:31,120
selling points of color pop is the

118
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:32,830
prices are very very low on most of the

119
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,840
products yeah and that's because

120
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:37,030
everything's in-house right so like we

121
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,130
literally like down to like a little

122
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:41,229
plastic mold that's right here - yeah

123
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:43,389
that's so cool well I'm really excited

124
00:04:41,229 --> 00:04:46,349
let's get a quick sister snack and then

125
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:46,349
head over to the lab

126
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:02,800
[Music]

127
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:21,709
[Music]

128
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:27,080
so I think we should go in the same

129
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,340
order that I would do my normal routine

130
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,800
then just to keep everything organized

131
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:32,330
so I could like figure it out inside so

132
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,860
I usually start my own foundation the

133
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:35,060
foundation is pretty much fixed it looks

134
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:38,000
like four different pigments that we

135
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:42,350
have white block and then red and yellow

136
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,850
so it's not easy and Colegrove has one

137
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:47,300
of the biggest changes no foundation

138
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:49,730
ever when I cover every single skin from

139
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,830
out there right right when I have like

140
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:53,510
every single shape or every single

141
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:54,470
person itself right I feel like home

142
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:56,180
does a really good job of that and I

143
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:57,860
think because it's all done in-house -

144
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,450
people always love to say like oh it's

145
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,790
really hard to formulate sort and shade

146
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:03,200
so when it's all done right here you're

147
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:04,850
watching the entire process go down so

148
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,770
you get to actually make it happen okay

149
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:09,070
let's figure out how to mix my shades

150
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:09,070
together

151
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:19,069
number one primary color is the white in

152
00:06:16,129 --> 00:06:22,460
the white okay so about how much do you

153
00:06:19,069 --> 00:06:24,379
think I should add just a poor gram for

154
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:28,159
how much is four grams okay so you're

155
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:31,220
gonna point out oh oh

156
00:06:28,159 --> 00:06:33,139
that's point four so two for Milli 42

157
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:36,710
different shades bonus the face and then

158
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:39,280
from there which is create alright so

159
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:41,750
like how like what goes into actually

160
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,770
differentiating every single shade it's

161
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,789
just literally just mixing the other

162
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,300
different pigments and hoping for the

163
00:06:43,789 --> 00:06:46,490
best

164
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,020
discard a bit too much okay today I

165
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:50,180
usually can't match on carnations anyway

166
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:52,539
so nothing will be different okay so one

167
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,539
more round

168
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:57,560
heavier than others see pop this one

169
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:59,990
senator discusses bigger one

170
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:03,699
oh yeah it's crazy because the littlest

171
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:03,699
little drop will actually nod to it

172
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:20,470
Killick may be point zero - that's good

173
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:34,790
it's just the eye shadow once you add

174
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:37,340
too much Barker going back like that oh

175
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:42,010
my gosh that one drop will change the

176
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:42,010
entire color - science is crazy

177
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:49,840
well then that looks like skin tone oh

178
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:53,150
my gosh that's me

179
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:55,610
maybe according to my foundation at home

180
00:07:53,150 --> 00:08:01,160
can I not skin tone no will I make it

181
00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:02,660
work yes it's only for pigment for all

182
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,460
the Browns who say oh we didn't formally

183
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,810
any dark shades it's too hard you heard

184
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:07,520
it right here folks take fine then it's

185
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:14,590
make it hop in it's not so hard to be

186
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:14,590
inclusive this is so squirt it in there

187
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:27,770
that was literally so easy let's do it

188
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:29,060
so our concealers already pre-mixed I'm

189
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:31,370
just gonna be killing it and my little

190
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:32,390
vial today it kind of odd

191
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:34,160
I guess not this show is really really

192
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:36,410
easy but what is like the difference in

193
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,850
formulation when it comes to concealer

194
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:40,490
because the form a little bit different

195
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:42,200
really different yeah completely deaf we

196
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:44,210
add more pigments the load of the

197
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:50,270
pigments is higher can we have more

198
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:54,800
coverage in the mother what is this hole

199
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:59,960
that's a wiper wiper it's just we shove

200
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:04,490
it on there there you go a good dough

201
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:08,060
fight well man that's so easy yeah yeah

202
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:09,410
hello I picked an egg bagel before the

203
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:11,870
first two steps of a retainer literally

204
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:12,920
all complete full coverage moment this

205
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:14,270
is probably a better match than the

206
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:23,120
foundation will be let's be real pale

207
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:25,850
and sad but good so what we do we have

208
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,760
our base formula which consists of

209
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:30,650
pretty much like cushion powders mmm and

210
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:34,330
then we have our fighters and we have

211
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:36,350
our pigment and then we have our liquid

212
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:37,970
so different from foundation a lot alike

213
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:39,890
the bronzers blushes and highlighters

214
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:42,200
are a powder base correct as opposed to

215
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:43,520
like a liquid right so then that's when

216
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,630
the pressing comes in because Limpopo

217
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:47,870
powders are mixed together then you

218
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:51,290
press and get into a pan yeah okay cool

219
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:53,810
so that's what we're doing today okay

220
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:57,650
we're gonna do afternoon delight okay

221
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:58,700
that's a great color for me so then

222
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:59,660
there's similar to the foundation

223
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,610
there's like a different way that goes

224
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,560
into each thing yeah so pretty much what

225
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:04,629
you want to do with

226
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:11,800
your spatula you're gonna spread it out

227
00:10:04,629 --> 00:10:16,149
evenly over like the chunks out yeah try

228
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:18,579
to keep the palak look your bike they're

229
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:20,800
not really clear montage it's like would

230
00:10:18,579 --> 00:10:24,670
that be good for crossing yes that's

231
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:26,189
good okay fun we just let me slide it

232
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:28,509
right in here

233
00:10:26,189 --> 00:10:30,490
we lost a little bit of powder we can

234
00:10:28,509 --> 00:10:33,249
actually fix that a little bit with the

235
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:35,709
psi so what this does this compresses

236
00:10:33,249 --> 00:10:36,999
the powders right so since we lost a

237
00:10:35,709 --> 00:10:38,920
little bit we can actually press it

238
00:10:36,999 --> 00:10:40,720
lower so I looked a little bit fuller oh

239
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,730
that's good god I've never forgotten so

240
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:52,800
do you want to do this yeah okay so just

241
00:10:42,730 --> 00:11:05,290
crank this down right here

242
00:10:52,800 --> 00:11:07,329
like that well of the club popper

243
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:09,370
blizzard Paul proof you need that when

244
00:11:07,329 --> 00:11:13,319
you're working with me oh my god nothing

245
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:15,910
little yay this is so this is a brother

246
00:11:13,319 --> 00:11:21,850
no it's normally a most thing I didn't

247
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:24,540
drop of it onto the floor and then it's

248
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:28,809
Bluffs pretty much the same thing -

249
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:30,639
let's do it just once again mixing all

250
00:11:28,809 --> 00:11:32,559
the pigments together yeah so like okay

251
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:34,509
so for example for me I usually like

252
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:35,889
more like peachy orange II types of

253
00:11:34,509 --> 00:11:39,519
gloss for my skin tones that would just

254
00:11:35,889 --> 00:11:42,079
be adding more yellow paper yeah yellow

255
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,189
and then an eyeshadow well right because

256
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,329
you don't want to put on the blush and

257
00:11:43,189 --> 00:11:46,160
have it literally take over your entire

258
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:47,360
face so if it's less pigment than what

259
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,550
would be the other ingredients that are

260
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,649
in there so powders that are in your

261
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:53,540
base it contains a lot more of less than

262
00:11:51,649 --> 00:11:54,499
your pigment when we have a lot of

263
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,910
liquids in it

264
00:11:54,499 --> 00:11:59,829
sometimes you have to decrease because

265
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:59,829
then we have talked about it with techno

266
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:10,189
keep it in there this time and this

267
00:12:02,749 --> 00:12:11,959
one's a little bit okay I'm definitely

268
00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:17,240
just gonna happen it's a little bit

269
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:43,179
harder around a thousand a thousand five

270
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:43,179
hundred and fifteen hundred like there

271
00:12:49,329 --> 00:13:03,549
you know everything you know for example

272
00:13:00,999 --> 00:13:04,420
the bronzer and the blush you like how

273
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:06,699
it's fluffy

274
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:08,829
yeah a week said I kept requesting it oh

275
00:13:06,699 --> 00:13:10,809
so heartless yeah cuz I know you see how

276
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:12,579
it looks a little bit it's a little you

277
00:13:10,809 --> 00:13:13,779
have okay so for the next time I would

278
00:13:12,579 --> 00:13:16,149
have pressed it a lot harder with about

279
00:13:13,779 --> 00:13:19,569
higher psi to make sure it's more in the

280
00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:21,160
pan yes sister you press it again so

281
00:13:19,569 --> 00:13:22,509
we're not gonna press it they got okay

282
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,829
lesson learned so for next time I would

283
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:25,179
press this a little bit harder to make

284
00:13:23,829 --> 00:13:26,410
sure it's in the pan one okay that's

285
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:30,509
cool so different formulas definitely

286
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:30,509
require a different amount of attention

287
00:13:34,889 --> 00:13:38,920
so speaking of pilot or now that we're

288
00:13:36,819 --> 00:13:41,679
done with faith products let's get our

289
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:44,009
glow so now we're moving needs lighter

290
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:48,089
so women II have some pieces fed okay

291
00:13:44,009 --> 00:13:52,379
we're gonna do which is gonna put it

292
00:13:48,089 --> 00:13:52,379
you're gonna put it under this pressure

293
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:59,549
you're gonna prep and see how this

294
00:13:55,989 --> 00:13:59,549
already into really nice and low

295
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:04,509
put her into one of these so that we

296
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:06,639
really have eliminates are you just

297
00:14:04,509 --> 00:14:10,769
gonna pretend to do this magnet and

298
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,769
we're just gonna make sure there is

299
00:14:10,949 --> 00:14:16,620
first of all that is really fun and this

300
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:20,009
is how we make every single one of our

301
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:22,540
highlighters out there in production but

302
00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:24,009
so what goes into like the making of a

303
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:27,910
highlighter for you as opposed to a

304
00:14:24,009 --> 00:14:31,630
normal shop it's on there somewhere when

305
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:33,670
it's giving you this long is this say

306
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:35,380
depends on the size of the throw that

307
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:37,810
you want to use there's one like a

308
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:39,579
really high glitter effect right we're

309
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:42,430
gonna be looking for a larger a lot

310
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:44,440
bigger in a defense of the under color

311
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:45,850
of the pie night as well okay cool

312
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,410
one of the common issues that I feel are

313
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:48,819
highlighters is that when you put on a

314
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:51,190
highlighter and it doesn't really match

315
00:14:48,819 --> 00:14:53,980
your skin tone sometimes the faith

316
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:55,509
you'll see like that gray calcium or if

317
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:57,459
it's like a letter 1 euro be darker

318
00:14:55,509 --> 00:14:59,790
that's when the base is not right for

319
00:14:57,459 --> 00:15:02,580
the skin tone and I'm not in the baby

320
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:04,980
all in the colors it's all a little rule

321
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:07,860
it's all whatever the pigment that you

322
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:10,110
use seen said it's making you look wait

323
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:12,540
okay yeah and that's one of the things

324
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:14,340
that we have to work on there right yeah

325
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:16,410
well we take it for a ballet show with

326
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:18,930
PD they're like oh it looks kind of grey

327
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:21,240
on my skin right so we have to get rid

328
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:22,770
of the photo about tweaking the cause

329
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,390
and every painter new for me make sure

330
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:26,280
that it works on all skin tone it

331
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:28,170
doesn't get by a great car yeah probably

332
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:30,390
you're ready yeah

333
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:33,240
into the walk literally already this is

334
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:34,650
so pretty Hello oh I'm just gonna put

335
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,810
down there the pressure okay

336
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:39,540
I'm just gonna just press all the way

337
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:41,730
down we thought she already has been

338
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:47,550
ordered on a job yeah so you're gonna

339
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:52,980
remove so I'll push it out push it up so

340
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:54,810
already has glue on it okay because the

341
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:57,230
magnet will do that for you oh my god

342
00:15:54,810 --> 00:16:00,090
that's so cool can I just rub it over oh

00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:50,140
that we all know and love and that I

356
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:52,480
love so many times but we didn't want to

357
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:54,130
do at least one thing custom not a

358
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,950
half-bad so I'm gonna be making a custom

00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:15,040
leading school we more towards pink and

366
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:16,840
peachy so therefore there should be more

367
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:31,870
red you're gonna add more red then

368
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:34,660
yellow I want less yellow right maybe

369
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:37,660
not that much like that cuz we're gonna

370
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:39,400
find out is there reasoning behind

371
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:42,670
putting the block in there what does it

372
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:44,080
do it's not gonna be too bright okay so

373
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:49,150
like how to mute the down a lot on that

374
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:50,890
like that much I think that's like

375
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:53,800
you're not that so like literally one

376
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:55,840
like extra little crumb of bonding your

377
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,640
entire color is wrong it makes a huge

378
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,410
impact oh I would be messing up

379
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,820
lipsticks left and right here so we have

380
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:02,530
my powders all mixed together mo now we

381
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:04,930
need to add at the liquid base that

382
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:07,590
makes it a glob so good enough to wet

383
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:07,590
the pigments

384
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:21,429
I just grind it together yeah you just

385
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:29,769
okay kinda fun kind of down oh that's a

386
00:18:21,429 --> 00:18:32,409
good actual color we're just gonna be

387
00:18:29,769 --> 00:18:34,389
like adding your pigments in here don't

388
00:18:32,409 --> 00:18:36,730
put your hand in there

389
00:18:34,389 --> 00:18:37,750
ya don't want to lose anything so I'm

390
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:39,940
just gonna pour it right over top of

391
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:43,750
here oh my god this is what I always see

392
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:45,340

Instagram paint mixing videos I watched

00:18:57,549 --> 00:19:08,440
those four hours okay now you're gonna

398
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:10,690

399
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,039
times it gets like that guys it's my lip

well I'm probably really good at that's

410
00:19:33,429 --> 00:19:38,649
probably it should do this as a job

411
00:19:34,509 --> 00:19:39,730
maybe perhaps okay yep let's do it

412
00:19:38,649 --> 00:19:41,679
alright so we literally just finished

413
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:43,929
baking almost my entire maker routine in

414
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:46,299
one hour we to sit I have a rethink all

415
00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:48,429
right here in-house custom made this is

416
00:19:46,299 --> 00:19:49,779
so incredibly cool but we do have one

417
00:19:48,429 --> 00:19:51,820
product left remaining and that is going

418
00:19:49,779 --> 00:19:53,230
to be of course the eyebrows the eyebrow

419
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:54,610
pencils are actually many parts in a

420
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:55,750
different building on the same facility

421
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,940
so we're gonna head it right over there

422
00:19:55,750 --> 00:20:00,539
right now so we can get my brows on

423
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:04,269
fleek what is that

424
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:07,139
dear down down gotta keep everything

425
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:07,139

428
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:06,970
[Music]

429
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:11,490
okay we do the same repetitive

430
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:22,049
[Music]

just press this one and this one

434
00:21:57,879 --> 00:22:26,789
together and then the bread

435
00:22:09,889 --> 00:22:28,950
I bet this is fully realized okay nobody

436
00:22:26,789 --> 00:22:30,599
okay so obviously this is my first time

437
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:32,669
doing that but you're like it I start up

438
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:39,019
the brows how many do produce and like

439
00:22:32,669 --> 00:22:39,019
an hour and hour

440
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:45,580
a day and all of the other hand yes that

441
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:47,560
is so cool

442
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:49,000
well I'll be taking one my videos that I

443
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:55,960
thought I'm doing brother this but I

444
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:58,420
it's so cool oh good around the assembly

445
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:01,180
line now all right sisters that is our

446
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:02,770
lab day aw complete we literally just

447
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:04,900
made every single product of our makeup

448
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:07,330
routine and only a few hours that was so

449
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:08,650
crazy and so cool to see everything here

450
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:10,360
in person obviously I'll put a link up

451
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:12,250
every single day we're getting to

452
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,990
actually see how hands-on it is I think

453
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:15,910
everybody involved from the start to the

454
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:17,530
end is such a cool amazing process

455
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:19,600
definitely has my wheels turning I'm

456
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:21,760
feeling very very inspired right now but

457
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,680
that is of course for the future for

458
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:26,620
right now I'm gonna take off my lab coat

459
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:28,720
oh and my hair and we're gonna head home

460
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:30,730
and actually do my makeup now using all

461
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,200
the makeup that's I made all these

462
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:34,300
sisters we are back for the lab and I

463
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:36,070
have here my little bag of DIY makeup

464
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:37,450
products that I made today I am so

465
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:40,750
beyond excited to actually put them on I

466
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:42,310
had so much fun learning and seeing the

467
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:44,560
behind the scenes process literally

468
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:45,880
everything was so cool so let's put on

469
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,380
the makeup and a talk about everything

470
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:49,090
started sorry makeup today I of course

471
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:51,100
like to go to my foundation first always

472
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:54,160
so I'm gonna grab the color pop no

473
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:55,510
filter foundation in the shade me

474
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:57,360
okay I'm gonna pray that this color is

475
00:23:55,510 --> 00:24:05,740
like a somewhat decent match

476
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:08,480
[Music]

477
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:10,220
fedil too much yellow I literally had an

478
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,690
entire team of professionals who do this

479
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:13,580
every single day to help me with this

480
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:16,040
and I still managed to make my shade

481
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:18,290
wrong my disappointed yes surprised

482
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:20,150
absolutely not probably my favorite part

483
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,590
of the entire day today was actually the

484
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:23,030
foundation process just because I

485
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:24,830
defined chemistry to be very very

486
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:26,600
interesting and thing that actually goes

487
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:28,160
into like foundation is really really

488
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:30,200
cool over the past three years I've

489
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,549
tried probably hundreds of foundations

490
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,020
at this point but I've only really found

491
00:24:31,549 --> 00:24:34,880
a few that actually really really worked

492
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:36,530
for me and my skin which is so crazy

493
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,970
because pretty much every major brand at

494
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:40,010
this White House the foundation line out

495
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:41,720
or is working on one and it seems like

496
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:42,980
always just foundation but you guys saw

497
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,600
the imagining out the ingredients today

498
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:47,210
and literally one wrong

499
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:49,160
drop of either pigmentation or color or

500
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:50,600
liquid or ingredient and the entire

501
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,620
batch would be completely wrong and

502
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,660
could actually ruin the entire

503
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:54,950
formulation so it's actually so cool to

504
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,870
see what goes into the first step of the

505
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:58,580
makeup process in order to even out all

506
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,990
of our skin tones although there are so

507
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:02,000
many ingredients and processes that go

508
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:03,559
into making complexion products probably

509
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,570
my favorite part of the entire day today

510
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:06,860
we'll see how easy it was to actually

511
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:08,360
mix together different pigments to make

512
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:09,559
different shades one of the biggest

513
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:11,660
problems in the makeup community whether

514
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:13,429
you want to admit it or not is racism

515
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:15,410
and unfortunately that is not a topic

516
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:17,120
that I am a stranger to but all that was

517
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:18,620
a nightmare at the time my old tweets

518
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,330
being brought back up and me being held

519
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:21,080
accountable for them oxy was probably

520
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:22,640
one of the best things that ever

521
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:24,260
happened to me it's truly changed the

522
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,880
person that I am today for the better

523
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:27,410
and it's made me realized that I have a

524
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,309
platform of a lot of people watching me

525
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:30,230
and of course they want to use that

526
00:25:28,309 --> 00:25:31,730
platform for good and I want to educate

527
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:33,590
on behalf of issues that are really

528
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:35,210
really important and shade range is

529
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:36,380
definitely one of those topics I feel

530
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:37,940
like they're vetted quite a lot of

531
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:39,470
foundation line launches within the past

532
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:41,690
few years with shave ranges that can

533
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:43,370
only be described as like just really

534
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:44,900
really embarrassing and one of the

535
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:46,910
excuses that big brands always seem to

536
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:48,380
get when it comes to the issue is oh my

537
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:49,549
god it's so much harder to formulate the

538
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,260
darker shades because we don't want to

539
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:52,910
get the undertones wrong and as a

540
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:53,990
consumer as someone who has never really

541
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:55,520
been involved with the making of that

542
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:56,990
process I am definitely ashamed to say

543
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,480
that I've kind of fallen for that but

544
00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:01,130
after seeing it behind the scenes there

545
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,440
is literally no excuse there's four

546
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:06,020
pigments add some more black add some

547
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,880
more red add some more yellow make it

548
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,970
work you saw here today folks it's

549
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:11,159
apparently

550
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:12,780
hard to be inclusive and I'm gonna let

551
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:14,429
you in on a little bit of a sister

552
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:16,440
secret and of course I don't speak for

553
00:26:14,429 --> 00:26:18,780
anybody here but people of color would

554
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,970
probably be really excited to see their

555
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:22,620
shade range represented and it's a web

556
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:24,960
win situation for a business when you're

557
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:26,610
actually selling products I just thought

558
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,830
I'd put that out there all right sorry a

559
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:30,150
rant over faces all on I just said it in

560
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:32,100
place and now let's move on to it

561
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:34,409
chiseling this out getting nice and it's

562
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:36,390
not I'm just gonna grab Miami 405 brush

563
00:26:34,409 --> 00:26:38,130
and dip into the custom bronzer shade

564
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:39,870
that I made so for the bronzer and blush

565
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:42,659
I actually found the whole egg pressing

566
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:44,340
process to be really really cool clearly

567
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:45,809
I struggled a little bit with getting

568
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:47,010
everything together and not spilling it

569
00:26:45,809 --> 00:26:49,289
on the floor but you know what

570
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:51,390
is my first time accidents do happen I

571
00:26:49,289 --> 00:26:52,770
was actually so surprised because I did

572
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:55,140
not realize that these processes were

573
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:56,309
all done by hand I really really thought

574
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:57,720
we were gonna be walking into the lab

575
00:26:56,309 --> 00:26:59,850
and there's gonna be like 80 million

576
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,200
conveyor belts and machines all pressing

577
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:02,760
and packing and mixing things together

578
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,809
but almost every single one of the

579
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,760
products that I was part of the process

580
00:27:03,809 --> 00:27:07,740
but today are actually all handmade in

581
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,179
the factory every single day by

582
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:10,710
hard-working employees I think that is

583
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:12,510
so cool so next time moving onto my

584
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:13,710
brows I made the shade at brunette today

585
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:17,820
and I'm just going to fill in my brows

586
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:19,919
like normal mmm that is a good brow tee

587
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:21,929
I also really really love the process of

588
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:23,850
making the eyebrow pencils too and let

589
00:27:21,929 --> 00:27:25,230
me tell you why obviously it was a whole

590
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:27,299
lot different than all the chemistry and

591
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:29,880
ingredients and formulations that were

592
00:27:27,299 --> 00:27:31,460
going on in the other love but when I

593
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:34,559
was a young kid I used to be obsessed

594
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:36,570
with the mechanics and figuring out how

595
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:38,549
things worked my dad was a self-employed

596
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:40,049
contractor when I was growing up and one

597
00:27:38,549 --> 00:27:41,970
of the reasons he was super popular in

598
00:27:40,049 --> 00:27:43,860
my town for jobs was that because he was

599
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:45,900
actually able to do so many of the jobs

600
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:47,070
involved everything from the design work

601
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:49,590
to the actual construction and building

602
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:51,150
to the plug into the electricity like he

603
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:52,679
truly was a jack-of-all-trades which is

604
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:55,350
definitely inspired my work ethic today

605
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:56,640
I always loved going to job with him

606
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:58,320
because of the fact that I got to sit

607
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,940
there and figure out how things were

608
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,770
made and how things worked

609
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:04,080
I love mechanics and pulleys and levers

610
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:05,940
I was obsessed with cords I don't know

611
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,470
how I never got electrocuted I had a

612
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:09,659
very very strange obsession with vacuum

613
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:11,330
cleaners don't ask because I literally

614
00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:13,070
have no idea but I

615
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:14,510
found that realm very very interesting

616
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:16,040
so seeing the machines and the

617
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:18,530
mechanisms that actually put the brow

618
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:19,790
pencils together was so cool for me not

619
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,410
even gonna lie even though there was

620
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:23,630
machine involved once again though

621
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:26,000
almost all completely done by hand no

622
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:27,700
robots real human beings working at

623
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,900
these stations producing up to I think

624
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:32,210
2,000 brow pencils in a day which i

625
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:33,140
think is so incredibly cool so moving on

626
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,760
to the next step which of course is

627
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:35,810
going to be my eye shadow I'm just gonna

628
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,860
throw it and look quickly using the

629
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:38,660
colour-pop and give it to me straight

630
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:40,220
eyes shadow palette I did not formulate

631
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:41,330
one of these in labs today just because

632
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,770
I'm already familiar with the process so

633
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:44,270
I just thrown this for cut crease a

634
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:46,040
moment I haven't done one in a hot

635
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:47,300
minute now really liking how this is

636
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,770
turning out but obviously I have a whole

637
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:50,930
entire eyelid that I want to fill up so

638
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:53,840
I'm gonna grab this super shock shadow

639
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:55,280
that I created today at the lab and pop

640
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:58,850
it on there I'm just gonna pop this

641
00:28:55,280 --> 00:29:02,810
shader right on the lid oh wow that's

642
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:04,280
pretty and I'm quickly just gonna pop on

643
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:06,580
a winged liner just to finish off the

644
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:10,760
eye look oh my god that eyeliner is is

645
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:14,480
eight inches thick I'm so scared of that

646
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:15,950
way oh my god keeps getting thicker this

647
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,650
is the worst eyeliner wing I've ever

648
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:20,630
done in my entire makeup history oh my

649
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:22,130
god how did this happen

650
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:24,260
oh my god if I take it off it's just

651
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:26,060
gonna get Messier so usually when a look

652
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:27,890
isn't going exactly as planned I'll just

653
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:30,560
like pop on a lot and it'll fix all my

654
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:32,420
problems that's not happening today but

655
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:34,040
it's not the makeups fault it's mine I

656
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:37,430
don't know how I got to 9 million

657
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:38,720
subscribers but alas my makeup is done

658
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:40,280
and I'm ready to move on to the rest of

659
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,810
the phase the next type of my routine is

660
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,160
of course going to be my highlighter I

661
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:45,440
need to get my glow on because I'm

662
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:47,090
looking a little bit a lot right now I'm

663
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,620
gonna use my super shocked highlighter

664
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:50,780
that I created with color palette today

665
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,680
and I am so excited I was actually

666
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:53,510
really excited to learn more about

667
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:55,130
highlighter and what goes into making it

668
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:57,080
just because I think it's that last step

669
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:58,910
that we all know and love and appreciate

670
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:00,380
I mean like who doesn't love a good glow

671
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:01,880
but I was actually so curious to see

672
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:02,990
like what goes into the formulation of a

673
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,040
highlighter does it really like there

674
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:05,600
are so many ways that I'd like a

675
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:07,010
highlighter has to perform and all at

676
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,690
the same time like I was saying at the

677
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:10,250
lab if the base color isn't right then

678
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:11,990
it can either look gray or orange

679
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:14,300
depending on the person's skin tone but

680
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:16,250
while doing that when you turn it has to

681
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:17,930
reflect on the light and look shine

682
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:19,640
there are different pearl sizes you can

683
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:22,010
either have like a tiny little pearl for

684
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:24,080
a subtle everyday woman on the goat

685
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:26,000
book low or you can have an intense

686
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:28,310
blinding and glittery glow which you all

687
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,750
know that I definitely uh I definitely

688
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:31,010
get similar to foundation that one thing

689
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:32,840
going wrong can literally change the

690
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:34,880
entire formula and either make it look

691
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:36,710
so beautiful or so bad which feels like

692
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,430
it's like a high-risk situation I mean

693
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:39,170
it's literally just creating a

694
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:40,880
highlighter but kind of some funny brush

695
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:42,290
so the last of my makeup routine today

696
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,550
is of course going to be in the lipid e

697
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:45,290
du das that I'm gonna use my cousin

698
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:46,520
gloss in a second but first I need to

699
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:47,750
start off by lining them so I'm just

700
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,610
gonna use my favorite lip liner of all

701
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:51,380
time which happens to be from colour-pop

702
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:52,730
with this one is not mine this is

703
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:54,140
actually the shade of curvy and

704
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:55,850
collaboration with Karen I love Saada II

705
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:57,410
not mine but wish it was because this is

706
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:59,000
literally the best lip liner color ever

707
00:30:57,410 --> 00:31:00,680
and Carrodus my all-time favorite people

708
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
in the makeup community and last but

709
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:03,650
finally not least right over top of that

710
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,990
lip liner I'm gonna pop on my custom

711
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:07,700
ultra glossy lip that I created today I

712
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:10,160
wanted just a perfect peachy nude

713
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:12,320
leaning more towards pink than orange

714
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:13,610
and this is what I came up with oh he

715
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,840
didn't really mean to make the lip in

716
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:16,490
the eyeshadow be like a perfect match

717
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:18,230
today but I'm gonna pretend like I did

718
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:19,610
because it kind of looks really good and

719
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:21,580
fresh let's finish it off with some

720
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:23,810
sisters head its prey

721
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:26,540
alright sisters and that is my full face

722
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:28,070
of makeup that I made all complete I had

723
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:29,360
so much fun getting my hands dirty and

724
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:31,250
working behind the scenes today with

725
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,540
collar pop to really see what goes into

726
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:34,220
actually making a make a problem from

727
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:35,540
