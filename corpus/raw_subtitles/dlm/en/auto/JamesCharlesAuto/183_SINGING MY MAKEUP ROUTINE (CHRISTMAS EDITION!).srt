chilly here in LA it is the Christmas

6
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,160

8
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,190
possibly can and this is the most

9
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,289
Christmassy outfit that I have so a

10
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,730

00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,140
but the makeup look that I have to wear

14
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,220
is very very boring a look that you guys

15
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,130

16
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,029

17
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,039
doing those looks

00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:31,500
I will never film them without making a

19
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,880
fun twist a few months ago I did a super

20
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,960
