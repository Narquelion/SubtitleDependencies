00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,080
hi sisters James Charles here and

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,460
welcome back to my youtube channel as we

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,319
all know Instagram was one of the

4
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,910
biggest social media apps in the entire

5
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:11,070
world obviously though I've been using

6
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,139
Instagram way more than normal recently

7
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,610
because of their new filters now when

8
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:15,900
Instagram first released arrays I feel

9
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,490
like not many people really care about

10
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,289
that because the filters on there

11
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,430
weren't that great at all so we had all

12
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:22,500
had snapped out for the last like

13
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,359
several several years snapchat gave us

14
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,279
the dog filter the skin soothing filter

15
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:28,080
and also the flower crown filter I mean

16
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:29,730
truly what else more could you really

17
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,289
need well apparently the answer to that

18
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,510
is quite a lot because recently

19
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:35,730
Instagram but took the crown out of the

20
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:38,160
ability for users on the app to actually

21
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:41,040
submit their own face filters and oh my

22
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,090
god it was quite the game-changer over

23
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,219
the last few months there have been a

24
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,809
ton of filters to go a very very viral

25
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:45,960
on Instagram because of how cute they

26
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:47,640
are

27
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,410
and I found myself wanting to open up my

28
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,030
stories to take selfies literally all

29
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,350
the time so for today's video I thought

30
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,149
it'd be a really cool challenge to try

31
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:57,649
to create Instagram filters in real life

32
00:00:54,149 --> 00:01:00,270
using makeup like this one this one and

33
00:00:57,649 --> 00:01:03,890
this one so if you guys want to see how

34
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:07,060
I created these looks keep on watching

35
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:07,060
[Music]

36
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:11,850
all right you guys something right into

37
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,680
today's video as you can see I already

38
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,910
pretty much have my entire base are that

39
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,410
most of these filters are based on like

40
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:17,970
either eyeshadow looks or just different

41
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,619
art things on the base they're going to

42
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,210
add on top of this but if you do want to

43
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:22,619
see how I created this base make sure

44
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,210
you like right up here and check out my

45
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:25,320
new updated makeup routine I've been

46
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,970
using a lot of new products and a lot of

47
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,050
techniques and I go super in-depth so

48
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:29,369
make sure you guys check that out if you

49
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:30,960
want to get to this stage before we

50
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:32,340
actually throw on the filters out of all

51
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,380
the filters that I've seen recently one

52
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,880
of my favorite ones to use myself is

53
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,160
this one which is called a blue

54
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,869
butterflies by a girl as you guys can

55
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,280
see it smooth out the skin add some full

56
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:42,720
crackles and also some cute little blue

57
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,970
butterflies at different places on the

58
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,470
face and it makes the lips a little bit

59
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:48,330
more plump so I'm going to try to

60
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,110
recreate this one using makeup the first

61
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,670
thing that we're gonna do for this

62
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:52,170
makeup look is to add on some faux up

63
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:54,030
freckles so I'm just gonna take a tiny

64
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:56,399
little liner brush so this is the m25

65
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:58,320
0-0 and a little bit of a brow powder

66
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,850
and just add on some cute little dots

67
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,289
I've done a few different videos on fake

68
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:03,179
freckles before on my channel but just

69
00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:04,560
to recap I'm using it different varying

70
00:02:03,179 --> 00:02:05,880
pressures all throughout some of the

71
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,990
freckles are a little bit more pigmented

72
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,970
and some look like they are more

73
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:11,760
underneath the skin it'd be more natural

74
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,890
obviously better then it's going to top

75
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,209
anything in as well fake freckles are my

76
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,799
favourite steps to do in any makeup

77
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:18,480
routine and they look so cute but I will

78
00:02:16,799 --> 00:02:19,950
say they are pretty challenging to do it

79
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,780
definitely takes quite a lot of practice

80
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:23,190
to get them to look real and natural so

81
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,180
it's all about different techniques and

82
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,650
seeing what works best for your skin

83
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,150
tone and then just on top I'm gonna take

84
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:29,430
a little fluffy brush and dip into that

85
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:31,110
same little brow shade a tub of any

86
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,209
excess product and then just kind of

87
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:34,950
lately like splotch this into what the

88
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:36,690
area this just adds back a little bit

89
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,950
more dimension into it the freckles and

90
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,690
kind of gives them more like sunkissed

91
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:41,489
look now I'm going to zoom you guys in

92
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,660
and we're gonna draw a butterfly all

93
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:45,660
right you guys so I took a photo myself

94
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:47,910
with this filter which obviously is okay

95
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:49,590
but I just went ahead and zoom to end so

96
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:51,299
that way I'm able to kind of use the own

97
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,190
filter as a reference when it comes to

98
00:02:51,299 --> 00:02:55,739
drawing this on so I'm just gonna first

99
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:57,299
start off with a tiny little brush and I

100
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:58,470
guess try butterfly so the first one

101
00:02:57,299 --> 00:03:03,019
it's like on the cheekbone like right

102
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:05,280
here so I'm scared okay

103
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:07,560
here making a little bit thicker at the

104
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,080
top and it is at the bottom usually for

105
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,490
me I prefer the opposite but

106
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:15,120
[Music]

107
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:20,760
that's a really bad joke sorry but I'm

108
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:22,230
gonna draw the two little wings Oh No

109
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,330
this might be a lot harder than I

110
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:26,040
thought it was guys oh oh okay and I'm

111
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:30,510
just gonna kinda mirror that on the

112
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:32,790
other side that looks so bad maybe if

113
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:34,260
it's colored it won't look like as awful

114
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,670
now just gonna grab some liquid lipstick

115
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,140
colors on the back of my hand I'm going

116
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:39,990
to start mixing together the different

117
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:41,880
tones for this butterfly and I'm just

118
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:43,200
gonna you know start filling this in and

119
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,840
really hope that it comes together

120
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,340
because right now it's not looking great

121
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,920
first I'm mixing together a super light

122
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:52,770
sky-blue tone and I'm going to put that

123
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,820
in the wings just like this the good

124
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:55,830
thing about like with up sticks too is

125
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,760
that they do what dry down so I won't

126
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:58,110
have to set them with eyeshadow

127
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,820
hopefully I'm even gonna take a little

128
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:02,250
bit of white as well and put that at the

129
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:03,210
very very like edges of the wings to

130
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,070
hopefully make a little bit brighter

131
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:06,870
then I'm gonna use a deeper blue tone or

132
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:08,370
that same little liner brush and put

133
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:10,230
this towards the middle of the butterfly

134
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:12,270
to create that like illusion of a shadow

135
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:13,470
as if the wings are opening grabbing

136
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:15,060
even darker blue shade I'm just gonna

137
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:17,520
add a little bit more dimension into the

138
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,530
very inner parts and also connecting and

139
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:23,040
like that wing up just like that because

140
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:25,110
it'll be a shadow in the middle okay

141
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,550
that doesn't look that bad I didn't

142
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:28,410
think I wanted to set this with shadow

143
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:30,120
but I honestly think I'm going to just

144
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:31,800
because some of the liquid lipstick is

145
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,000
like a little bit shiny still and I

146
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,010
really want to make sure it's fully and

147
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,360
matte so I'm just gonna go out at the

148
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:39,600
mini palette and grabbing a little bit

149
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:41,880
of a playground on a flat brush having a

150
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,850
little bit of a flashback just to

151
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:46,590
highlight yes okay now doing that same

152
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:49,110
exact thing a book and I use the little

153
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:51,990
bits the co-op's adding in some

154
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:54,360
dimension in the wings right up against

155
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:56,880
the edges of the butterfly and then

156
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:00,030
creating some super thin little fine

157
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:03,780
strokes like that into the body as well

158
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:06,210
it was good now I need to use a tiny

159
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:08,340
liner to outline the butterfly it's so

160
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:10,590
better got Maya tomforde liner I'm gonna

161
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:12,690
carefully outline this and also create

162
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:15,300
the shapes that are inside the witness

163
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:17,130
okay dot you can't tell me that's not

164
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,460
cute that is cute and now last but

165
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:21,979
finally not least I'm going

166
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:24,680
to add a few more super tiny dots about

167
00:05:21,979 --> 00:05:27,410
light blue just on the bottom Horsemen

168
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:30,710
of that wing okay that's cute that is

169
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:31,729
cute that looks good right all right you

170
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:33,470
guys didn't think that is one of the

171
00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:34,699
butterflies all complete I was

172
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:36,500
definitely a little bit nervous at first

173
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:37,849
but I think this is one of those type of

174
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,440
art pieces that definitely takes a lot

175
00:05:37,849 --> 00:05:41,150
of like layering to get to the final

176
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,710
result and I think it looks pretty cute

177
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm gonna speed through and add two more

178
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:45,349
than John's with my face then we'll come

179
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,310
back to finish off this look all right

180
00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:47,690
you guys these are all three of the

181
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:49,400
butterflies all completes and I think

182
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:51,139
this looks so cute I'm literally

183
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,250
obsessed at this and very much Randy of

184
00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:54,320
the blue a butterfly look from the

185
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:56,150
campaign last year and now our brand new

186
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,830
intro graphics um you could definitely

187
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:59,240
stop right here but I want to keep going

188
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:00,889
to turn this kind of hold filter into a

189
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,630
look I'm just gonna add on a subtle

190
00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:04,310
little blue winged liner just kind of

191
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:06,020
like weighing up my eyes out so grabbing

192
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:07,580
this wider brush this is the ambit 213

193
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:09,620
and I'm gonna dip into a little bit of a

194
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:11,539
playground on this brush and I'm just

195
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:13,190
going to kind of smudge just on my lash

196
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:14,289
line in the shape of a wing but not

197
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:17,120
worrying about it being too defined

198
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:19,940
focusing at majority of this color on

199
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,849
the outer portion of my eyelid to really

200
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:24,289
focus on pulling it upwards okay with

201
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:25,699
any extra healthy Russian was going to

202
00:06:24,289 --> 00:06:28,370
lightly buff out that edge because I do

203
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:32,539
not want it to be a super defined line

204
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:35,120
and now I'm just going to grab a an

205
00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:36,590
angled brush and dip into a cola the

206
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,210
dark blue shade of the pallet once again

207
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:40,280
and use this to make a little bit more

208
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:42,349
of like a defined weighing one thing I'm

209
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,909
just really pushing the shadow into with

210
00:06:42,349 --> 00:06:46,400
the lash line and I'm only gonna focus

211
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:48,110
this color on that outer corner and wing

212
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,539
and then you guys know what my little

213
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:52,669
new trick just gonna spritz that brush

214
00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:54,530
and get any excess shadow on there wet

215
00:06:52,669 --> 00:06:56,930
pinch it together so it's super sharp

216
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:59,630
and then create a tiny little line right

217
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:01,610
in that inner corner yes oh my gosh

218
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:03,500
that's okay actually I'm happy I did

219
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:05,330
this oh yeah then with my little

220
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,880
concealer brush from my foundation

221
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:10,219
beforehand describing a tiny little bit

222
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:12,110
of concealer cleaning up that wing oh my

223
00:07:10,219 --> 00:07:13,669
gosh I just applied some mascara using

224
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:15,469
my Mac extended Piatt and I'm just gonna

225
00:07:13,669 --> 00:07:19,490
pop on my pair of Lily lashes at Miami

226
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:22,370
flares wow this is a pretty when they

227
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:23,810
snap all right both hands now complete

228
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:25,460
and we are so close at the end we only

229
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:27,949
have one step left and that is of course

230
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:29,300
the lips now the Instagram filters for

231
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:30,420
some reason always like to make the lips

232
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,860
like NASA

233
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:33,810
and I feel like it's only appropriate to

234
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:35,910
a follow suit so I'm going to grab my

235
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:37,800
irregular lip liner which is pervy from

236
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:39,480
colour-pop and I'm going to go a little

237
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:44,760
bit crazy you could do over lining today

238
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:46,440
because actually okay no it does well

239
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,270
no it's crazy imagine I come back the

240
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,040
next video like my sister's Jane Charles

241
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:52,110
her local dog to each other I was

242
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:55,950
popping on some lipstick and finally

243
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:57,570
gonna top this off some gloss all right

244
00:07:55,950 --> 00:08:00,000
you guys and this is the blue butterfly

245
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:02,280
at filter by agar on Instagram all

246
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,810
complete I am obsessed with how this

247
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,280
left turn out I honestly would have no

248
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:06,510
problem walking out like this in public

249
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,070
a little details on the butterflies were

250
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:09,300
a little bit challenging at first but I

251
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,110
think we definitely got the hang of it I

252
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,550
think that you guys could easily

253
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:12,930
replicate this at home if you do

254
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:14,700
definitely tweet me a photo and make

255
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:16,110
sure you tag gege as well for credit of

256
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:18,600
course but now it is time to move on to

257
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:19,650
the next love the next filter that I

258
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,700
really want to use today is one that

259
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:23,100
I've been seeing out quite a lot

260
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,750
recently and that is a cloudy day by

261
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,070
Brian now I really like this one because

262
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:28,050
it is a little bit more simplistic

263
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:29,370
there's no like crazy reshaping like

264
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,630
some of the other filters but it is

265
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:31,740
super cute with just some white clouds

266
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:33,000
on the cheeks which should be pretty

267
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,900
easy to recreate with makeup and then I

268
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,580
have a really fun idea for the eye

269
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,810
shadow look as well alright eBay so

270
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,820
literally all we're gonna need for this

271
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:40,500
look is a white cream paint or liquid

272
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,370
lipstick or white concealer literally

273
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,780
anything that you have in your

274
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:44,520
collection and then also a white

275
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:46,020
eyeshadow today of course I can be using

276
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,280
the morphe axioms Charles the shade

277
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,870
flashback and the palette because it is

278
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,730
super super pigmented and also a little

279
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:52,050
concealer brush this is the morphe m22

280
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,910
for literally what i'm gonna do is just

281
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:55,860
take a little bit of this concealer on

282
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:57,140
this brush but I'm going to go in and

283
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:59,340
you see a little bit of like a little

284
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:00,870
nice little hump and then with the

285
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:02,190
excess concealer I'm just going to

286
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:03,780
carefully blend

287
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:05,550
downwards just like that and I'm going

288
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,930
to put another hump right over here and

289
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:08,610
then you look a little bit right in here

290
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:11,160
move a little bit over here as well

291
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:14,010
literally like that took me three

292
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:15,330
seconds flat now with a little fluffy

293
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:17,730
brush I'm just going to grab a little

294
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:20,610
bit of flash back and just set that

295
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:22,800
concealer in place and then also use it

296
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:24,810
to kind of buff out that bottom edge

297
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,120
because we do want these clouds to look

298
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:28,260
very very fluffy and soft on the face we

299
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,060
don't want them to look like they're

300
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:31,680
like very sharp or anything coming up a

301
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,400
little bit more concealer then do

302
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,770
another one

303
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,880
maybe right over here bboogle for a

304
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:38,760
smaller ones huh

305
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:40,710
they went over here to a really tiny one

306
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,750
that's so cute a little cloud floating

307
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:43,710
in the end okay with any excess powder

308
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,600
I'm just gonna put a little bit more

309
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:47,400
flash Brown kind of around the cloud

310
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,390
region it just what like looks like I

311
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,560
don't know it's like floating in the sky

312
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,820
or something now I just wanna add a

313
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,110
little bit of dimension to these clouds

314
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:57,600
so I'm actually gonna pick up the brand

315
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:58,440
new at morphe at 35 i palette this just

316
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,790
came in the mail this morning and i

317
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,610
opened it right away because this

318
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:04,800
palette is so beautiful oh my god it is

319
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:06,540

320
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,920
shades I'm obsessed this I cannot wait

00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,850
to create looks with this and this look

322
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,290
today I'm little just gonna be using

323
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:11,430
this gray shade so you definitely don't

324
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:12,750

00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,890
just how does he send it next to me but

326
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,600
if you guys do wonder check this out I

327
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:17,850
would definitely recommend and of course

328
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,200
you can use coaching whisper 10% off I'm

329
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,940
just gonna use the light gray shade to

330
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,460
add some dimensions and between link the

331
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,450
little humps of the clouds okay so that

332
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:26,220
is pretty much the filter of this

333
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:29,570
already complete I think it looks super

334
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,570
cute now for the

335
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,100
I had a sneeze coming in that laughs are

336
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,079
you kidding me

337
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,970
Jesus for the eye portion of the slug I

338
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,259
really want to create a white smokey eye

339
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:49,300
now I'm not sure if this is gonna look

340
00:10:47,259 --> 00:10:50,499
ridiculous but we are going to try it so

341
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:52,689
I'm just gonna grab a little bit more of

342
00:10:50,499 --> 00:10:54,790
that white concealer and I'm gonna put

343
00:10:52,689 --> 00:10:55,929
it on my eyelid aside from like a cut

344
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:57,309
crease I don't think I've ever actually

345
00:10:55,929 --> 00:10:59,350
done anything with a white eyeshadow

346
00:10:57,309 --> 00:11:01,509
before which is crazy to think about but

347
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:02,230
I have wanted to for a very very long

348
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:04,149
time

349
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:06,429
so this could look really really cool or

350
00:11:04,149 --> 00:11:07,449
really stupid but I guess we're gonna

351
00:11:06,429 --> 00:11:10,089
find out in a second

352
00:11:07,449 --> 00:11:11,410
honestly that's cool that is cool okay

353
00:11:10,089 --> 00:11:13,420
so I just looked at my last short I just

354
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:15,249
found these para from Daddy B lashes by

355
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:17,199
a jenny 69 I love her the absolute most

356
00:11:15,249 --> 00:11:19,149
and the sale is called IG and I think

357
00:11:17,199 --> 00:11:20,559
this is actually perfect for this look I

358
00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:21,579
really like Miami's obviously but I

359
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:23,709
think they're a little bit too intense

360
00:11:21,579 --> 00:11:25,509
whereas this will look nice and like I

361
00:11:23,709 --> 00:11:29,350
almost want to say like this is really a

362
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:30,790
girl anime style makeup look so what

363
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:32,410
this is like very cartoony which I think

364
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:34,420
will be good I just layered on some

365
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:35,949
flash back from my palette over top of

366
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:37,449
the white shade from the other palette

367
00:11:35,949 --> 00:11:39,100
that I was using and literally look at

368
00:11:37,449 --> 00:11:40,899
how much better that looks not to like

369
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:42,399
to my own horn or anything but to to it

370
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:43,809
we've handed that alright you guys so

371
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,579
this is pretty much half of the face of

372
00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:46,689
this cloud look all complete I'm gonna

373
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:48,129
speed through the other half and we'll

374
00:11:46,689 --> 00:11:50,980
be right back to finish off the rest of

375
00:11:48,129 --> 00:11:52,749
the face Wow oh my god this is cute okay

376
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:54,129
now for our last and final step of this

377
00:11:52,749 --> 00:11:56,860
makeup look I think I just want to put

378
00:11:54,129 --> 00:11:57,730
on like a look at a little ombre oh my

379
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:00,850
god I'm gonna give a little bit of this

380
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:03,999
red gloss you know talking about oh that

381
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:05,679
is everything oh look at that

382
00:12:03,999 --> 00:12:07,059
okay now let's gonna grab a little bit

383
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:09,040
of the Fenty beauty gloss in the shade

384
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:11,050
of fussy alright the guys like I said

385
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,660
super super simple that is this a cloudy

386
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:15,160
day filter by Brian all complete oh my

387
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:16,779
gosh I love how this one turned out it

388
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,829
was very easy to recreate I think that

389
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:19,329
you guys could definitely do this at

390
00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:21,730
home I think this look is very light and

391
00:12:19,329 --> 00:12:23,439
gellick almost euphoric if you will this

392
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:24,999
is a very lucky for his style and makeup

393
00:12:23,439 --> 00:12:26,439
look I like this I definitely wanna try

394
00:12:24,999 --> 00:12:27,999
out more looks with my eye shadow in the

395
00:12:26,439 --> 00:12:29,499
future as well let me know what you guys

396
00:12:27,999 --> 00:12:31,120
think if you recreate this make sure you

397
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:32,319
tag me and the original creator but

398
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,899
let's move on to our last and final

399
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:36,309
filter okay I somehow managed to get all

400
00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:37,749
the clouds and the white makeup off my

401
00:12:36,309 --> 00:12:39,850
face and we are back to my normal base

402
00:12:37,749 --> 00:12:41,829
ready for the final filter isn't popular

403
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:43,449
as I miss Kylie Jenner and it ends this

404
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:45,000
one which is called a cherry on the cake

405
00:12:43,449 --> 00:12:46,170
by Barbara balance

406
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,190
now as you guys can see there's

407
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:49,380
definitely more of that like crazy

408
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:51,060
reshaping a fact that we had in filter

409
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:52,980
number one so we can do that again at

410
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:55,050
with those hips and this look these ones

411
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,130
were crazy we have a whole lot of pinky

412
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:57,570
tone blush which I've been loving

413
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:59,130
recently some pink eyeliner and then

414
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:00,510
also two super cute cherries on the

415
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:01,800
cheekbones which we can draw on with

416
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:03,000
some liquid lipsticks again there

417
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,230
shouldn't be too hard one to recreate

418
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,730
and I think it looks really awesome so

419
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,690
let's just jump right in alright you

420
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,830
guys so for the first step of this

421
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:09,690
filter I want to go ahead and add the

422
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:11,250
pinky toe in a blush all over the face

423
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:13,980
I'm gonna use this blush from that

424
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:16,410
called dolly mix and just this little

425
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:17,820
cute chocolate hill blush brush I wonder

426
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:19,170
do this first just because blush is one

427
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,730
of those things that tends to kind of

428
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:22,680
wear off during the makeup application

429
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:24,450
process and I don't want it to go away

430
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,490
so we're gonna load this on there

431
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:27,840
great we're just gonna can I bring it up

432
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:30,620
to my temple just a little bit as well

433
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:32,430
why not might as well fade it up there

434
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:34,680
does it have a little bit of blush on

435
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:36,900
the nose as well let's see oh yeah it

436
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,850
goes all the way up geez like the entire

437
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,470
face is pink I mean I love blush but

438
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:41,820
this is a little bit excessive what

439
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:42,930
about on the nose why not

440
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,820
alright now I'm gonna go ahead and add

441
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:46,320
the highlighter so just taking nm5 whole

442
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:48,510
one brush I'm gonna dip into literally

443
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,890
from the palette and you guys know I use

444
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:51,600
this all the time as a blush shade to

445
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:53,160
mix together at my blush and highlighter

446
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,020
because it's kind of like a pinky peach

447
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,390
orange each eye on it but it also has a

448
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:59,040
beautiful pink reflect just so I'm gonna

449
00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:00,930
put this on my cheekbones give it a

450
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:06,720
little spritz oh look at that that is a

451
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:08,100
gorgeous and then just to intensify that

452
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,350
pink glow a little bit I'm gonna throw

453
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:12,510
it way back to the og a beauty guru days

454
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:14,130
to the anasazi Beverly Hills moon child

455
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:15,300
pellet this was the first palette that I

456
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:16,770
picked up that have the pink highlighter

457
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:20,460
in it as you can see it has clearly been

458
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:27,210
through quite a lot it is so beautiful

459
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:28,589
is that enough blush question oh my god

460
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:30,630
I then just super quickly I'm gonna add

461
00:14:28,589 --> 00:14:32,100
on a few of faux freckles to this look

462
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:33,900
just because it does have them in the

463
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,420
original filter and I want to stay true

464
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:37,620
to it let's draw some cherries so to

465
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:39,150
draw the cherries once again I'm gonna

466
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:41,040
use a liquid lipstick and for this I'm

467
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:42,990
just gonna grab the Kylie in the shade

468
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,210
the after party matte but of course you

469
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:46,530
guys can use any red that you want too I

470
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:48,690
like this one because it is definitely

471
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:50,520
more of like a pinky tone red then an

472
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:51,810
orange E tone red I'm really sticking a

473
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,730
true with the color scheme that we

474
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:54,350
clearly have going on right now I wish

475
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:56,090
there was like

476
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:58,370
where that I could like stamp this on my

477
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:59,900
face I wonder oh my god let me try to do

478
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:03,860
this okay if I use like a bottom of the

479
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:05,420
lipstick it like rub this in there is

480
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:07,010
this cheating and I'm now going to try

481
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:16,220
to stamp this this might be a really bad

482
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:20,360
decision but it also could be good okay

483
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:22,400
well that was a flaw there we go and now

484
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:27,070
I'm just going to I mean I guess I'm

485
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:27,070
just gonna like literally do oh gosh I

486
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:32,270
mean there we go some lovely four

487
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:34,070
circles all right now I'm having a flat

488
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:36,020
brush I'm gonna dip into the shade at

489
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:37,370
you're kidding from the palette or any

490
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,990
other bright red shadow that you may

491
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:40,160
have just to you know really make the

492
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:42,980
staining that we're about to get even

493
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,930
worse and we're going to set that red

494
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:46,130
liquid lipstick in please just to make

495
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:47,510
sure it doesn't move or smudge around

496
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:49,270
okay no in this filter the cherries are

497
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:50,750
actually completely flat and just like

498
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:52,640
one-dimensional or I guess

499
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:54,200
two-dimensional hello but y'all know me

500
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:56,030
I like to go above and beyond so I just

501
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,980
want to take a little shader brush and

502
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:59,420
dip into a little bit of boutique which

503
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:00,440
is the maroon shade from the palette and

504
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,700
I'm just gonna add a little bit of

505
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:04,010
shading to the cherries just so they're

506
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:05,270
not like one solid color cuz that's kind

507
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:07,070
of boring I'm also gonna take that same

508
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:09,470
brush that we use the white on in the

509
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:11,690
last look for the clouds and grab a

510
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:13,760
little bit of flash back maybe a little

511
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:15,110
bit of pink a tea drink a tea as well to

512
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,850
the palate then I'm gonna use this to

513
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:18,950
add some highlights in to the opposite

514
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:21,530
corner of the charities now we have to

515
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:23,630
add on the little stems so I'm just

516
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:25,870
going to grab a green liquid lipstick

517
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:27,530
and then just connect the two together

518
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:30,920
then I'm just going to draw on the

519
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:32,480
little leaves as well and then I'm just

520
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,730
gonna set this in place using a little

521
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,340
bit of a social blade from the palette

522
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:40,790
now I'm going to use a block liner and

523
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:43,970
outline everything this is so hard

524
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:45,590
oh okay so now I'm gonna draw the little

525
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:47,950
face details that they have on the

526
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:47,950
filter

527
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:57,390
time for the final details we add in the

528
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:59,810
white liner I mean could be better could

529
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,810
be worse

530
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:08,970
period alright now just let me know I'll

531
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:11,400
just put some nice pink highlight in my

532
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:14,340
inner corner perhaps some skip from the

533
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:16,710
palette to start off this a lovely oops

534
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:18,930
that's bright I hated my palettes to

535
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:20,910
purchase to want a little inner corner

536
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:23,400
glow in there perhaps a little bit of

537
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:25,110
literally I definitely donate that

538
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,420
that's okay great now we're gonna add a

539
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:28,770
little bit of a brow bone highlight for

540
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:30,870
lashes today I'm just gonna pop all up

541
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:34,200
my Lily lashes in the style Miami

542
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:35,610
regular not the flare this time we are

543
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,680
now on to the last step which is of

544
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:39,120
course the ellipse personally I would

545
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:41,010
love to just leave this look right here

546
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,690
I think this looks super cute I'm very

547
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:44,640
very happy with it so far I don't want

548
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:46,500
to do the whole like big lip thing but

549
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,030
I'm gonna respect the artist so we're

550
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,590
just gonna go true to the filter and

551
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:51,090
we're gonna over draw the living crap

552
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:53,130
out of my lips once again

553
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:54,480
alright sisters at last with finally not

554
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:57,450
least and that is our cherry on the cake

555
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,100
by a Barbra mite so it's a filter look

556
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:00,570
all completes I think out of the three

557
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,010
filters that this one was definitely the

558
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:03,540
most challenging it just because getting

559
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:04,740
the circles be nice and round getting

560
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,810
the kind of cherries in the right place

561
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:09,240
but in the end I do think this one is

562
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:10,530
the cutest little changes on my face but

563
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,670
I think the simplistic inner corner

564
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:12,960
definitely turned out really really good

565
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:14,430
but I'm definitely looking forward to

566
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,720
hearing what you guys have to say once

567
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:18,180
again if you read this one that make

568
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:30,039
sure you tie me in the original artist

569
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:30,039
