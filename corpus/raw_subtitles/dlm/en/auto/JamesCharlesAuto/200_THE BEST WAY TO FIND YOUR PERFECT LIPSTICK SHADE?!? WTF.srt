00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,059
you may be noticing seeing a little bit

6
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:14,160
weird and that is that I have on the

7
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:16,199
phone Blair but I'm missing one thing

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,119
and that is the list currently I'm also

9
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:19,740
missing the snail bumper talk about that

10
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:22,199

00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,760
don't talk with me lately that's what oh

12
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:25,920
there's been a very very viral tweet

13
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,140
going around of a screenshot of a clip

14
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,359
from the show of the doctor once to tell

15
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,859
that boy viral is a video of a woman are

16
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,050
talking about how the color of your

17
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:36,090
nipple may be the best way to tell how

18
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,559
to find your perfect nude lipstick shade

19
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,989
so that is exactly what we're going to

20
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:41,700
do for today's do I have ten of my

21
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:44,460
all-time favorite nude liquid lipstick

22
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,930
shade I'm going to my shirt off and

23
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,210
we're going to swatch all ten and see

24
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:49,860
which 3's match the closest then we're

25
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,930
going to try them on and see at the end

26
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:54,090
which nude liquid lipstick shades wins

27
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:57,000
and if it matches the color of my

28
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:58,920
nipples so without further ado let's get

29
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,579
my shirt off and let's get on with the

30
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,260
video

31
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:03,449
okay not only are we not going to talk

32
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,159
about my broken nail but we're also not

33
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:07,500
going to talk about my lawsuit phrasing

34
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:08,490
listen the girls is busy I have not gone

35
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,590
in three weeks

36
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,060
let's just say this is foundation color

37
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,280
it did not stress to my body

38
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,409
it still exists like seven here I don't

39
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,610
even know if you can see on camera just

40
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:19,710
don't call it about it please

41
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:21,990
so like I said I have ten of my all-time

42
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:23,490
favorite nude and liquid lipsticks and

43
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,710
I'm going to be swatching a thigh around

44
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:27,689
each nipple to see which colors match

45
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:29,490
the closest that'll be picking to get

46
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:31,680
top three of putting them on and seeing

47
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:34,140
which suit I like the best I also have a

48
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,270
piece of paper and a pen so I can keep

49
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,700
track of where each color is on the nips

50
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:41,310
so I don't forget anything but yeah I

51
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,750
guess let's get started the first thing

52
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,040
I'm going to be trying to say is the Kat

53
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,759
Von D's liquid lipstick of the shade a

54
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,409
bow and arrow

55
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,810
this is my all-time favorite nude

56
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:50,490
lipstick I was all the time to most my

57
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:52,649
offense and mostly photo shoot so I just

58
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:53,579
want like a natural look and putting

59
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:56,040
this next to the nipple

60
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:59,759
oh my god they look really really really

61
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,530
similar this could actually work not bad

62
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,030
of a color match honestly that's going

63
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,409
to grab the anasazi lip in the shade

64
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,899
Asha and I'm going to put that right

65
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:07,530
next to a bow and arrow the toll of an

66
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:09,899
options are

67
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,190
not a little bit better 2d am I going to

68
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:14,310
need to pluck out this new pointer

69
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:16,140
I don't know how about trading on camera

70
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:18,000
but in person the action liquid lipstick

71
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,950
is definitely a lot more red than my

72
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,230
actual nipple itself so we're going to

73
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:26,000
move on of course and actually I'm going

74
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:28,170
to using is crush also from anna sophia

75
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,880
cross is definitely a lot more pinky

76
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:31,470
toned of course showing the other two

77
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,390
but it is still pretty close with the

78
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:34,770
nipple color I don't know

79
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:37,830
but the next one I'm going to use potato

80
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:39,180
light G from as you a cosmetics light is

81
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:41,400
that with a lot more pinky tone to my

82
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:44,190
nipple Millie Nevelson work like orange

83
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,750
II totally average person is that normal

84
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:47,100
so you saw every time I think they're

85
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,060
fun to do because it could be saying it

86
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,590
way too much

87
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:53,459
unless you're underage then take a shot

88
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:55,650
of apple juice either way so sorry for

89
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:57,300
all the nipples for my lashing on this

90
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,950
tip I'm gonna be using the daddy liquid

91
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,900
lipstick from jeffree star cosmetics in

92
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:02,700
collaboration with many anyway this is a

93
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,760
lot more brown tones I'm thinking this

94
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:07,440
one might be a closer and then the brown

95
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,569
tones in it daddy definitely matched

96
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,340
closer to my nipple it is going to be

97
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:13,079
driving a little bit darker I feelings

98
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,120
but when all these drives we will

99
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:16,260
definitely compare but for now dot

100
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,060
elastica cookies definitely a

101
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,680
front-runner I'm going to let all these

102
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,760
colors dry it out completely and while

103
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,500
we do that we're going to move on to it

104
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,090
the other nipple so for the first song

105
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,040
we need more people lipstick in the

106
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:27,989
shapes of vanity and you guys know you

107
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,680
can use go to James for 10% off all more

108
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:30,360
P products

109
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,610
okay so definitely same situation as

110
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,870
crush and light see over here the change

111
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:35,640
is definitely way too pink to be

112
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,810
matching at the end missile provide

113
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,400
actually and I squeezing the colour-pop

114
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:40,230
liquid lipstick in the shade where ES

115
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,239
and I'm now realizing this is a ultra

116
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:43,799
fluffy lip and not a matte one so I'm

117
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,329
not really sure how's it going to work

118
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:47,010
on my chest but we're going to do it

119
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:48,840
anyway because this shade has it more

120
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:50,840
orgy hunter told a little bit in the

121
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,070
other J so this might be good match

122
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:55,380
which is not going to dry I guess which

123
00:03:53,070 --> 00:04:00,150
might be interesting that's will head in

124
00:03:55,380 --> 00:04:01,739
I think so that this one is a gloss is a

125
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,970
lot harder to see on Chandler because

126
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:03,400
the lights are reflecting obviously

127
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:06,040
there

128
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,870
but this one is actually not too far off

129
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,280
it's obviously a lot less pigmented and

130
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,629
then liquid lipsticks that are not

131
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,300
because it is a gloss or they usually

132
00:04:10,629 --> 00:04:14,769
limit more complete the color is pretty

133
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:17,380
close to the ordinary chosen there's

134
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:19,120
definitely a lot closer to the nipple so

135
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:21,250
yeah the squad with the next one

136
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,770
for my next column museum target crowd

137
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:25,930
lip paint and the shade festival this

138
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:28,120
color is not very closely but honestly

139
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:29,979
I've never used this apartment really

140
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,320
producers definitely might be ending up

141
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:34,270
in look sometimes to whom this one is

142
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,800
ever like a mob but has more purpley

143
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:38,919
undertones so definitely not gonna shame

144
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,360
me like orangie round tones of relatable

145
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:41,740
so I don't think this one's gonna be a

146
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,210
very very high contender

147
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,919
we're next color I'm using the over

148
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:46,210
lifted up Sigma shade at mocha this is

149
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:47,950
one of my all-time favorite liquid

150
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:49,570
lipsticks period this is one of the

151
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:51,520
first things I ever bought from Oprah

152
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:53,410
and it still remains to this day one of

153
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,910
my all-time favorite colors I love this

154
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:57,669
one some really cool things that it does

155
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:59,289
the job not its color definitely a whole

156
00:04:57,669 --> 00:05:01,389
lot darker than the nipple itself which

157
00:04:59,289 --> 00:05:02,830
breaks my heart but who knows it's

158
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:04,389
definitely my favorite change so maybe

159
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:07,330
this staying with my favorites and

160
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:08,710
matching debunks this whole nipple miss

161
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:10,630
color but we're going to finish off and

162
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:12,010
find out for sure last but not leave

163
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:13,479
mine amazing the over liquid lipstick in

164
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:16,030
the shade at Pasadena and I forgot to

165
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:17,979
mention this before but code James just

166
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:20,139
like more bees don't get you 30% of all

167
00:05:17,979 --> 00:05:21,430
of the little six and the over lizard

168
00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:23,020
lipsticks had like all times paper

169
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,919
formula they are so low and they wear

170
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,389
all day long

171
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:27,430
definitely recommend checking it out if

172
00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:28,930
you have not already Pasadena is very

173
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:30,310
similar to walk up but it's a little bit

174
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:31,570
lighter in a little bit more thorn cheek

175
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:34,180
so this doesn't looks like it is a

176
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:36,760
critic attached to the nipple region I

177
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:38,320
like this one for sure alright guys so

178
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:40,210
this all-century is completely dry down

179
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,160
except of course the left off but that

180
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:44,050
was my to follow sorry about it just

181
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,639
feels very very strange right now but

182
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:47,080
I'm going to pick the top three that I

183
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:49,330
think much feedback and we're going to

184
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,710
wash them and try them on going in the

185
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:52,389
same water that we came in if you leave

186
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:55,530
top of the bow narrow is a very very

187
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:58,300
good contender so is a daddy for sure

188
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:59,800
like G is definitely way too pinks I

189
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:02,020
think that was out of the question

190
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:04,240
squash is also a little bit too pink and

191
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:07,570
a little bit too light and ashen is way

192
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,880
too red moving over to as if nipple baby

193
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:12,039
festival are a little bit too purpley to

194
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:13,719
make the cut my nipples are not purple

195
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:15,400
unfortunately that would probably be

196
00:06:13,719 --> 00:06:17,500
pretty cool to be honest

197
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,000
tell us off Boston affairs which is a

198
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,919
little bit too preachy to its really

199
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,020
much and the mocha liquid lipstick is

200
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:24,669
obviously way too dark felt these are

201
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:27,400
final contender for the top three as

202
00:06:24,669 --> 00:06:28,270
Pasadena from Oprah as we are all over

203
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,650
the nipple area

204
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:32,800
thank God it's one of him soon do you

Pasadena and the Jeffrey sizes lipstick

210
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:47,889
in the shade is daddy I'm first going to

211
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:49,600
tap on be a bow and arrow so here is

212
00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:52,030
bone arrow all completely applied and

213
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,740
dry to the lips I absolutely love with

214
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:56,139
color so much I feel like it matched my

215
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:58,020
skin tone very very very well it's

216
00:06:56,139 --> 00:07:00,430
something with my ultimate favorite news

217
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:05,620
emergence wash it daddy from the jeffree

218
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:07,840
star cosmetics alright so here is daddy

219
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:09,550
all applied and completely dry I do

220
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,680
really really love this shade as well I

221
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:13,840
feel like it also suits my skin tone it

222
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,699
is a little bit more growl tone than

223
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,889
bolero is but I feel like it still looks

224
00:07:15,699 --> 00:07:18,940
really really well if the last month

225
00:07:17,889 --> 00:07:24,130
we're going to be applying the over

226
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:26,440
Pasadena with the lipstick alright so

227
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:28,330
here is Pasadena fully applied and dry

228
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,250
so into the other two colors I really

229
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:32,020
really like those it's lips on me this

230
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:34,150
one a little bit more pinky tone then

231
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:36,970
bow and arrow and daddy's epic still

232
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:41,919
love this color and here are all three

233
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:43,120
shades compared to each other alright

234
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,860
and that is the test I'll complete it

235
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,240
not being biased to any of them I am

236
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,680
going to leave this last of the lipstick

237
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,479
on because I feel like if I take my lips

238
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,370
off one more time they would literally

239
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:52,630
get crusty and then all of completely so

240
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:55,930
I'm just going to try to avoid that

241
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:57,580
today I was so skeptical at first but

242
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:59,020
all in all these three liquid lipstick

243
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:00,820
shades that did not my nipple or

244
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:03,370
honestly some of my favorite music all

245
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:04,690
time and I feel like they did all look

246
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:07,389
really really good suck you liked this

247
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:09,039
test is counted a complete success after

248
00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:10,990
saying the 3 different colors to watch

249
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,130
that matched best with my nipples I want

250
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,840
you guys leaving a comment down below

251
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:15,460

252
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,199
that you like the best on my skin tone

253
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,729

for your skin

259
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:27,880
