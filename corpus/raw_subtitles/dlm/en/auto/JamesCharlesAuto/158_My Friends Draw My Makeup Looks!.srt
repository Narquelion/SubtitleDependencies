00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,440
looks i think i'm gonna start off with

110
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:54,910
the easiest one which it's really not

111
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,440
even easy at all but it's Abby's and

112
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,580
Gucci look so I'm going to zoom you in a

113
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,050
little bit and we're going to get

114
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:01,120
started okay I'm first starting off a

115
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:03,640
little bit of concealer on my eyelid to

116
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,110
act as my eye a shadow base as always

117
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,850
and then I'm gonna set that in place and

118
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:08,890
draw that like brown a wing it using the

119
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:10,150
shader punch me from my palette while

120
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:11,530
I'm working on this eye as well I want

121
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,540
to take a brief moment to dis brag about

122
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:15,130
Abbey Roberts and how literally proud I

123
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,660
am of her if you guys don't follow me on

124
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,620
instagram for a long time now which if

125
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,060
you don't

126
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,680
hello wouldn't even doing you absolution

127
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:22,720
um I used to do these things probably

128
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,950
like two years ago called sister Sunday

129
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,670
takeovers were basically every single

130
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:26,620
weekend

131
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:28,660
I looked for incredibly talented but

132
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:30,400
like unknown small influencers and I

133
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,750
asked them to film videos creating a

134
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,340
makeup blog and then I posted it on my

135
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,810
stories and like gave them a bunch of

136
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,400
definite try to help them grow their

137
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,780
pages it was a really fun way to just

138
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,040
showcase a smaller artist which

139
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:40,420
obviously we were now doing in a much

140
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,700
bigger way with instant influencer which

141
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:44,710
is amazing but the first ever person

142
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:46,240
that did it take over on my account like

143
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:47,680
two years ago when she had I think it

144
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,350
was like thirty four thousand followers

145
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,390
was Abby Roberts like that's how we got

146
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:55,060
started and now because of tik-tok Abby

147
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:57,460
just hit I think 10 million absolutely

148
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:59,080
insane and so well deserved I mean if

149
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,250
you guys look at any of Abby's content

150
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,990
she is literally one of the most

151
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:03,580
talented people in the entire world I am

152
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:05,860
still inspired by her every single day

153
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:07,150
so watching her like rise I just been

154
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,710
incredible and I'm just so grateful that

155
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:11,080
I got to be part of it in a smallest way

156
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:13,360
like oh she's just super super cool so

157
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,260
now using this red liner I'm going to

158
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,600
draw in

159
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:17,800
that line is so messy oh I have not done

160
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,780
makeup in like a weeks

161
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:22,330
you're almost done all I have left is to

162
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:23,590
add the Gucci logo now I'll be also put

163
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:25,780
a little bit of yellow in the inner

164
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:27,130
corner so I'm going to plop this into

165
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,780
here and hope that it doesn't ruin the

166
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:31,600
entire thing I think the finish off this

167
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:33,400
arm is gonna add a little bit of punch

168
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,840
me on the lower lash line just to tie it

169
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,790
together all right you guys that is one

170
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,320
of these at Gucci is all complete but I

171
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:40,080
saw a whole nother eyeball to do I'm

172
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,190
gonna try my best to do this quickly

173
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,660
off-camera and I'll be right back with

174
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,680
the finished love all right you guys

175
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:46,300
well it took me a little bit but I

176
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,160
finally matched the lips to the eyes and

177
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:50,260
I think with that being said that is

178
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,780
this Gucci I inspired by my good friend

179
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:54,550
Abby Roberts all completes right now

180
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:56,890
it's probably the only time in my entire

181
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:59,110
life that I wish I had one of the lovely

182
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:00,490
Gucci tracksuit to take a photo and win

183
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:02,080

rainbow at the end like this is really

196
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:22,330

blue layer onto the eye I am aware that

211
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:54,790

is going to be a Von Teese that fun

249
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,479
colored cheetah print look I think this

250
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,860
one's actually going to be it relatively

251
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,840
easy so let's just go ahead and dive

252
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:41,310
right in I'm first gonna use just a

253
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,840
purple base I happen to have this dose

254
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:45,090
of color is that matte liquid lipstick

255
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:46,590
lying around and out on the basic color

256
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:47,820
I want to talk a little bit about Imani

257
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:49,770
because literally she's one of the

258
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,910
nicest people in the entire world I love

259
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:52,380
her I mean obviously if you're like a

260
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:55,230
fan or tik-tok you know who a Bonnie is

261
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:56,130
she is huge on the app she is so much

262
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,300
fun and despondent that I see people

263
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,650
that I've literally never met but the

264
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,030
reason she actually blew up on Tech Talk

265
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:02,130
was because of these are really really

266
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:03,990
cool like crazy a clown but he owes it

267
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:06,120
and she blew up because she's actually a

268
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:08,100
really really talented makeup artists as

269
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,510
well he also signed out while I'm on the

270
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,770
topic if you guys want to see a collab

271
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:12,150
between me and Emani it's actually

272
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:13,680
during like Halloween time but something

273
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:14,820
with crazy clowns please let me know

274
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,320
because I feel like that would be so

275
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,940
much fun and it was so crazy because the

276
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,800
first thing that I ever actually met her

277
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:21,330
I asked her if I could send her some

278
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,280
merch and she told me that she already

279
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:25,770
literally had like all the collection

280
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:27,300
and when I came home to brag about how

281
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:29,130
excited I was to meet everybody and how

282
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:31,230
amazing they all were my assistant was

283
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:32,670
like James we've actually posted her on

284
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:34,350
the sistas apparel account like years

285
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:36,450
ago before she blew up which was

286
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:38,070
crazy I didn't even know that so Avani

287
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:40,400
is a true sister now that we have that

288
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:42,990
all on I'm just gonna grab the shade

289
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,340
hello single flame palette and you

290
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:49,590
sisters have that shadow in place or

291
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:51,270
though what now that we have that liquid

292
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:53,190
lipstick all in place on my eyelid I'm

293
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:54,540
gonna grab the show you to single from I

294
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,350
am how I thought I'm gonna use that to

295
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,430
set it in place

296
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:58,680
once that set in place I'm just gonna

297
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:00,750
use a little bit of my foundation just

298
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,430
to clean up that line and make it super

299
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,420
sharp so now that the base is all on I'm

300
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:06,150
basically just kind of start adding

301
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:10,140
these like cheetah I said is this this

302
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:12,000
cheetah print right big cat big Hobbit

303
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:13,140
print but I'm gonna use a block liquid

304
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,460
liner this is the only one that I could

305
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:16,170
find laying around kind of little just

306
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:17,640
gonna draw on like random little shapes

307
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:20,070
this one could be a little bit like

308
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,260
wonky a little bit big there you go sure

309
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:23,430
sure

310
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:24,900
and now just a tiny liner brush I'm just

311
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:27,360
gonna grab me a little bit of green

312
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:30,420
liquid up SEC and I'm going to just add

313
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,710
on like that outside well I don't even

314
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,120
know how do you describe cheetah print

315
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:34,200
just like the outside blocks out of

316
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,120
usenet local is like I'm actually gonna

317
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,160
grab the anasazi at Nora bina liquid

318
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,440
liner because the formula of using bomb

319
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,520
oh yeah that's what we need I think I'm

320
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,900
just gonna go in with a little bit more

321
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,950
block and just clean up some of the

322
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,540
areas that like got a little bit of

323
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:47,400
messy but I think this is okay actually

324
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:49,680
also just for fun that all popped really

325
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,700
accentuate the green features we have

326
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,500
all round here I'm just gonna take a

327
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,820
little bit of that access electric liner

328
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,560
and put it in my waterline which mind

329
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,890
you it's not eye safe so just don't

330
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,890
follow along

331
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:02,450
beauty is pain is what they do say all

332
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:03,770
right you guys this is actually turning

333
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:04,730
out to be a pretty easy maybe I

334
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:06,470
should've done through this one first

335
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,460
when I was filming earlier on how could

336
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,720
I cover a few minutes and do it the one

337
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:10,670
off camera and I'll be right back with

338
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,460
the finished look I'll race you guys and

339
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:16,010
this is a body's 90s rugrats cheetah

340
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:17,660
print makeup look all completes to be

341
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:19,280
completely honest aiya literally hate

342
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:20,240
animal print and this color combination

343
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:23,090
is saying that I would normally it'd

344
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,350
never go for her but I am so so so glad

345
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:33,380
that Avani sent this in because I think

346
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:35,960
this look turned out so cute do you like

347
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:38,990
it I really like 90s and Rugrats cheetah

348
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:44,270
print inspired your boyfriend is a

349
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:47,090
cancer gonna post right now okay love

350
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:48,890
you - thank you so much - a bunny for

351
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:51,470
sending this look and now it is time to

352
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:54,380
wipe this off and start over one final

353
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:57,170
time okay we are back the base is still

354
00:11:54,380 --> 00:12:00,680
on somehow okay a taking my makeup on

355
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:02,660
and off four times today not an but

356
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,190
David's look is actually really cute we

357
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:06,440
put together this like very emoji

358
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:08,660
inspired a starry night type of makeup

359
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:11,030
look so I'm gonna do my absolute best to

360
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:12,860
recreate it and I think the first step

361
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:15,080
is going to be creating a regular block

362
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:16,700
a smoky eye what's gonna grab a cream

363
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,710
eyeliner this one happens to be from

364
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:20,390
Sigma I'm gonna use this as like a base

365
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:21,770
instead of using like a concealer for

366
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:23,300
the eyeshadow that will stick on top and

367
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:24,980
now I'm just using a small fluffy brush

368
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:26,600
and a little bit of spooky a front of

369
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:28,760
the palette I'm going to start by a

370
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,870
buffing out those edges now that the

371
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:34,730
block is along I'm gonna go ahead and

372
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:36,410
draw these stars as Wow okay so we're

373
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:37,730
just gonna draw star first now we're

374
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:39,890
gonna need to draw with a nice starry

375
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:41,720
trail that really goes around the

376
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:42,770
eyeball okay so now I'm gonna use a

377
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,840
little bit of eye shadow to add a

378
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:47,240
dimension into the stars just like on

379
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:49,010
the actual emoji having a tiny little

380
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,830
detail brush like this one this is the

381
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:54,710
morphe e39 I'm just gonna dip into being

382
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:55,670
and try to add some dimension oh my god

383
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:57,120

384
00:12:55,670 --> 00:13:03,420
stars
