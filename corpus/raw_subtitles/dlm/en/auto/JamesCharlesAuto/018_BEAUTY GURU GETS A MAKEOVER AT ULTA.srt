e glittery smokey eye for this fall

19
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,100
season and it's not too hard but also

20
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,140
not too easy of a makeup look to

21
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,399
recreate for these various artists after

22
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,809

26
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,800
drag or pick apart any artists work it

27
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:48,510

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,710
have done differently if it were me so

00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,449

45
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:22,590
glam makeover so walking into also today

46
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,930
my foot was at 2:30 I showed up at about

47
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,740
225 and was seated right away so that

48
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:27,330
was really really great

49
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,820
they were definitely right on time and

50
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:31,170
ready to start working which I loved I

51
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,400
was told by the manager running the glam

52
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,780
counter today that my artist was gonna

53
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,729
be darrell and he came out and

54
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,840
introduced himself he was so so sweet

55
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:38,130
and nice and I'm gonna leave his

56
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,750
Instagram right up in here so make sure

57
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:41,490
you go check it out and show him some

58
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,720
love so the first thing that my artist

59
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,759
said today was apply some moisturizer

60
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,920
and he used the Peter Thomas Roth

61
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,899
moisturizer I was so excited about this

62
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,759
because you guys know the sister James

63
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:52,290
loves her moisturizer I literally

64
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:54,509
moisturize my skin like two or three

65
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:57,360
times a day it is so salt vital to have

66
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:59,040
clear and healthy skin so I love a good

67
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,500
moisturizer especially before I put on a

68
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,909
lot of heavy cakey makeup next Terrell

69
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,350
asked me about my skin and I told him it

70
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:06,060
was combination two now getting a little

71
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:07,049
bit dry because the weather changed and

72
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,759
he looked really really closely and

73
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:10,289
picked up these Smashbox pore minimizing

74
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,810
primer to apply over top of the

75
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:12,370
moisturize

76
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:14,890
but under the foundation as a nice

77
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:16,209
primary base I am definitely not proud

78
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:17,440
of my pores I try to pretend like

79
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:19,030
they're not there and I wish they

80
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,650
weren't there but I was definitely

81
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:22,300
really happy today to see that my artist

82
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:24,040
did recognize them and do his best to

83
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:26,260
cover them up and smooth them over for a

84
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,090
smooth foundation application after the

85
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:29,680
primer was all set in place he went in

86
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:31,810
and used the anasazi abroad to find her

87
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,310
to start defining and slaying my brows I

88
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:34,810
hid the brows in the mirror I really

89
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:36,400
really like the shape - my artist went

90
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:38,950
with I feel like they arched the way I

91
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,170
like them the tail isn't too long and

92
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:42,850
they have a nice shape to them I do wish

93
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:44,320
however they were a little bit cleaner I

94
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:46,030
think the lines could be a little bit

95
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,930
smoother especially on the top and there

96
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,250
are few places that I would have

97
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:49,900
definitely spoolie through or added a

98
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,610
little bit more product to just make

99
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,650
them more even throughout but I don't

100
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:55,269
think they're bad by any means next my

101
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:56,590
artist probably ions using the tar

102
00:02:55,269 --> 00:02:58,390
shaved cave concealer which we'll get to

103
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:59,800
in a little bit and then he started in

104
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:01,569
with the eye shadow and for today's eyes

105
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,370
shadow palette he chose that Anasazi up

106
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:05,830
monitor - on Ashley palette which I was

107
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:07,750
so so excited for because it is one of

108
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:08,980
my all-time favorite palettes he first

109
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,330
served it by playing some orange

110
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,760
transition shades and really blended

111
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:14,319
them out very very well looking close up

112
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,840
the blend for the transition shades and

113
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,549
the crease are really really nice it

114
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,570
looks very very seamless and even leaves

115
00:03:18,549 --> 00:03:21,850
a lot of room for the brow bone

116
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:23,049
highlight which I love I really can't

117
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:24,370
stand with eye shadow goes all the way

118
00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:26,170
up to the eyebrow it just is really

119
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,790
really what do I make up pet peeves

120
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:29,350
sorry I really like the way he applied

121
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:31,269
the shadow today so next about it with

122
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:33,519
more tart shaped a concealer on a flat

123
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:35,500
top concealer brush and started to carve

124
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,579
out my eyelid for a cut crease I was

125
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,380
very excited to see him do this because

126
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:40,780
you guys know a half-cup creases of my

127
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:42,400
all-time favorite makeup styles and he

128
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:44,079
was actually the only artist to actually

129
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,630
define a crease with concealer before

130
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:48,340
applying the gold shadow on the lid Java

131
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:50,590
I think was definitely rocking a half

132
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:52,299
cut crease in her look so I think that

133
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:53,530
by him doing this by far but it has

134
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:55,329
looked the most accurate to the original

135
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:56,680
for the actual gold I'm the lady used

136
00:03:55,329 --> 00:03:59,260
one of the gold shadows from the lorac

137
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,670
gold eyeshadow palette and looking at

138
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,230
the shadow close-up I think that this

139
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:03,459
gold on this particular look it's

140
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:05,560
probably the most accurate to what

141
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:06,760
Jacqueline's original color was I really

142
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,049
really like the shade of gold I feel

143
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,150
like it's not too orange and it's not

144
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:11,560
too yellow either it's a very very

145
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,150
pretty in the middle shade that is

146
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,859
perfect for this look however looking at

147
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,180
this actual crease close-up I feel like

148
00:04:14,859 --> 00:04:18,130
the shape is a little bit weird for my

149
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,959
eyes I do wish she would have made it

150
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:21,700
more rounded following my natural eye

151
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,540
crease I feel like it is really really

152
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,650
high up and

153
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:25,300
which for some reason which doesn't

154
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:27,160
exactly flatter me the most and as well

155
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,840
I do feel like in the actual like middle

156
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,610
crease region the line is a little bit

157
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:32,260
messy I do wish it was a little bit more

158
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:33,640
defined but it's really not that big of

159
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,290
a deal I was just happy to see him doing

160
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,970
a cut crease once the eye shadow was all

161
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:38,530
complete he decided to skip lashes for

162
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:40,540
now and come back to it later on and

163
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:41,800
then we went on with the base for my

164
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,000
foundation today he went ahead and up

165
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,950
hide the two-faced before this way

166
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,300
foundation which I was so excited about

167
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:48,040
you guys know the vorlons mate it's on

168
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,660
my all-time favorites I always mix it

169
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,250
with my George Armani luminous silk or

170
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:53,290
layer on top of my makeup forever Ultra

171
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,850
HD stick so I was so so pumped to see

172
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:56,080
him using this he applied the shade to

173
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:57,430
natural beige today which looked really

174
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,470
really great in the store with the

175
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:02,230
lighting in there but I will say looking

176
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:03,700
at it now looks absolutely awful to his

177
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:05,590
defense I will say that in the store

178
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,220
letting the shade match did look really

179
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:07,720
good

180
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:09,910
so I don't think this is a fair thing to

181
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,140
bash him on at oh I don't know what it

182
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,790
is with these make up stories and having

183
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,350
the artist do makeup and this awful ass

184
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:16,060
lighting but we really need to get like

185
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:17,980
rain lights lay it up mirrors or

186
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:19,420
something because having this foundation

187
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:21,280
look perfect in store and then having me

188
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:23,170
walk out and look like this it's really

189
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,640
really not ok and genuinely worries me

190
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:26,530
for any of you guys going here makeup

191
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,150
done that's just so bad and nobody wants

192
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:29,770
to have either a flash memory situation

193
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:31,480
or situation where your face looks like

194
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:33,250
a completely different color that's so

195
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,020
bad and take it from me you will be

196
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,850
laughed at by probably a lot of people

197
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:38,380
unfortunately once again it's over to

198
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:40,060
the Mac video he used one of those tiny

199
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,860
drugstore triangular sponges to blend

200
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,910
out the entire face and we had to come

201
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,200
in the last video that it was really

202
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:45,820
really impressive because I felt like it

203
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,020
was but then after reading all the

204
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,310
comments everyone was like wait this

205
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,660
isn't even that impressed that everyone

206
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,920
did this do you guys work with the

207
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,420
tyrants or liberate those are the only

208
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,520
sponges and you had to use those for

209
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:56,140
every makeup application oh my god

210
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,820
now we have Beauty blenders kabuki

211
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:59,170
brushes and everything in between but I

212
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,490
feel like it's impressive now because

213
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:02,500
nobody no one uses them anymore but

214
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:03,250
maybe I'm just crazy definitely know

215
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,450
what you guys think

216
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,590
do you guys use if you do blender or a

217
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:07,630
makeup sponge I feel like at this point

218
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:08,830
it's like a necessity but definitely we

219
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:10,150
call it double Oh tell me what you apply

220
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:11,110
foundation with because at this point

221
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:12,790
I'm just curious

222
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:14,650
next the foundation was all applying and

223
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:16,990
by now it was time for concealer and for

224
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:18,130
today he is the Tarte save tape couldn't

225
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:20,020
sealer which you guys know as my

226
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:21,760
all-time favorite so I was so so excited

227
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:23,230
to see him pulling this out and getting

228
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,640
ready to use he's always that literally

229
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,900
everyone asked for it when they get

230
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:28,150
their makeup done also which is no

231
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,500
surprise at all and for today he used to

232
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:31,150
shade a light on me which is the same

233
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,040
machine that I use so I was very very

234
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:35,770
excited to see him using this I think it

235
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,400
looks as usual perfect on my skin once I

236
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:38,440
face is all

237
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,970
I used a big fluffy brush and went in

238
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,770
with the it cosmetics translucent

239
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:42,910
setting powder I've actually never tried

240
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:44,680
this one out before so I was very very

241
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:46,210
excited to try out a new product and how

242
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,350
about on my face and see how at war I

243
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:48,820
felt as though it did a really really

244
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:50,350
good job of mattifying me and keeping my

245
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,580
makeup in place and I didn't really get

246
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:53,139
a lot of Christ's either which is

247
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:54,639
amazing we were definitely stuck in

248
00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:56,380
traffic for a pretty long time on the

249
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,509
way home today so it definitely did a

250
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:00,460
good job of long-wear he next butted in

251
00:06:58,509 --> 00:07:02,289
contour my face and nose using anastacio

252
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:03,580
contour palette asked that the face I

253
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:05,440
have no complaints I feel as though he

254
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,789
did a really really great job he put in

255
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,199
all the right places and didn't put too

256
00:07:06,789 --> 00:07:09,940
much on because you guys know that is

257
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:11,289
only big as pet peeves definitely did a

258
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,710
really great know of mixing the color as

259
00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:13,210
well

260
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:14,410
I'm definitely chisel but I'm not to

261
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:16,000
bronze to either so I feel like it was a

262
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:17,380
really really great medium my nose

263
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,210
contour he used the same exact contour

264
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:20,889
palette which was fine but he also used

265
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:22,479
the same exact brush to contour my nose

266
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:24,190
which I was a little bit spooked about I

267
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,050
did tell him that I wanted a very very

268
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:27,280
pinched nose contour to begin with just

269
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:28,720
like I told all the other artists I'm

270
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,270
not even kidding guys it's probably like

271
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,250
this side it's like this is not a nose

272
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:34,690
contouring brush 3 this brush is what I

273
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:36,250
use for my nose contour as you can see

274
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:37,960
there's a very very huge difference in

275
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:39,639
the sides here and I was very very

276
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,530
spewed to anyway and with this you guys

277
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:43,030
know that a good pinch and snot nose

278
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:45,160
contour it's like my favorite element of

279
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:46,599
my makeup routine so I was a little bit

280
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,860
disappointed in the nose crunchers today

281
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:48,729
I feel like it was a little bit messy

282
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,650
and definitely could've been blended

283
00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:52,240
more and also was a little bit too wide

284
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:53,889
or however said it he applied the shade

285
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,270
of champagne pop from Becca which is in

286
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:56,680
collaboration with Jacqueline Hale I

287
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:58,060
don't think he actually knew who

288
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,310
Jacqueline Hill was so I feel like this

289
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,750
is a complete coincidence but obviously

290
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:03,580
if you guys know this was a chocolate

291
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:05,680
Hey look so I was happy to see him using

292
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:07,090
champagne pop that's for sure and I do

293
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,919
love this how the door shaped I was very

294
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:10,840
very excited to see him using it today I

295
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:12,820
do feel like the application is pretty

296
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,169
good he did use a really really big

297
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:16,240
brush which once again i was a little

298
00:08:14,169 --> 00:08:18,070
bit spooked about i don't know why he

299
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,380
did I usually use a very very tiny one

300
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:22,330
like this one the m5 the one from morphe

301
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:23,770
but I feel like he bonded out really

302
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:26,740
really well and it doesn't look bad I

303
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:28,900
don't know so highlighter is good next

304
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:30,400
was time for the lashes my artist Ashley

305
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,599
well style I wanted for this particular

306
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,130
look and I showed on the picture of

307
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,930
Jacqueline again and so that I want

308
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:36,099
something just like these wispy and

309
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:38,080
definitely laughs that get a little bit

310
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:39,310
longer on the ends he brought over four

311
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,900
different pairs for me to choose from

312
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:43,060
and I ended up picking the are gel

313
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:44,290
studio effect demi wispies before

314
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,850
applying the lashes I told you all that

315
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:47,290
I have small eyes and always have to cut

316
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:49,170
my lashes so they're comfortable to wear

317
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:50,820
and he decided to do that today

318
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:52,560
the lashes which I very much appreciated

319
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:54,420
he glued them on he's in the classic duo

320
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,770
lash glue and once they were on their

321
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,600
controlled wear and I could not feel

322
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:59,250
them which is it great and then the next

323
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,990
step was gonna be of course the ellipse

324
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,550
while he went to grab washes my artist

325
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:04,080
actually handed me a Ben of different

326
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:06,270
liquid lipsticks that I could pick out

327
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,380
from for today's look so this makeover

328
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:09,300
in general I would say was definitely a

329
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,620
lot more hands-on than the other ones he

330
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,090
was asking me a lot of questions which I

331
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,650
definitely appreciated but also asked me

332
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:14,670
to pick a lot of things as well which a

333
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,960
little bit defeats the point of the

334
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:18,150
video being that I wanted the true

335
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,620
artist interpretation but I picked out a

336
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:21,300
lipstick that I thought was pretty close

337
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:23,100
so I ended up picking the anasazi liquid

338
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,180
lipstick in the shade of trust before we

339
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,770
actually went and started the lip

340
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,300
application he asked me how I like my

341
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:28,860
lips Sean and I did tell him that I like

342
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,780
them a little bit overdone on the top

343
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,160
lip you guys know that this is a big

344
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,390
thing in lastik video where my artist

345
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,220
actually underlined them a little bit

346
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:36,630
but my lips are a little bit uneven so I

347
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,890
really really love over lining them to

348
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:40,080
even them out and make them a little bit

349
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:41,790
more plump on the top left but the shape

350
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,560
of the lips I really really love how the

351
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:45,270
top lip turned out I feel like he did a

352
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,950
really really great and clean tamil

353
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:48,540
overlining the top lip it looked very

354
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:50,160
very nice and very similar to how I

355
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,660
would do it and the bottom lip looked

356
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,120
pretty nice too although it was a little

357
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,860
bit messy on the very very bottom right

358
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,600
below like the center arc point I do

359
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:59,430
wish it was a little bit cleaned up but

360
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,380
it's not that big of a deal and then as

361
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:03,930
the color obviously was perfect but then

362
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:05,430
again I picked it not the artist last

363
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:06,690
but certainly not least finish I'll just

364
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:08,040
look by spritzing my face using the

365
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:09,720
Urban Decay all nighter setting spray

366
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,370
you guys know how to use this all the

367
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,350
time and then he even grabbed a palette

368
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:15,480
and used that to kind of a fan and help

369
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:16,350
it dry which I love by Fanning the

370
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,910
settings but you're really helping

371
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:19,320
everything amount together and really

372
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:21,000
get a smooth application so that is

373
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,650
something alternative techniques alright

374
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,840
guys and this is the final look from the

375
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:26,040
alta makeover today look at myself in

376
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,050
the mirror and thinking about my total

377
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,720
experience today at Ulta I would rate

378
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:32,130
this makeover overall a 7 out of 10 I

379
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,600
think my alter artist today definitely

380
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:35,100
used a lot of different products and

381
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,690
techniques that I would normally use in

382
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,520
my own maker patina which I was super

383
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:39,990
super excited about such as Too Faced

384
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:42,180
Born This Way Foundation and a Tarte

385
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:43,710
shave tape but there are a few things on

386
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,960
the stuff that I don't exactly love

387
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:47,400
being the shape of this crease the lip

388
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:50,160
shape the foundation shade and just

389
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:51,120
overall attention to detail like I said

390
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,380
the whole point of this series is to

391
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,940
have different artists showcase their

392
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,740
work and their very own techniques and

393
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,970
how they differ from my own all right

394
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,530
