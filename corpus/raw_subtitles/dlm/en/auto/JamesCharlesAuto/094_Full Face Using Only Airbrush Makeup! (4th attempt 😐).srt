00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,929
hi sisters James Charles here and

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:05,580
welcome back to my youtube channel and

3
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:07,200
it's currently a rainy day here in a

4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,700
California while we were on quarantine

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,290
and for today today I just wanted to sit

6
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,340
down and play with makeup and we're

7
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,200
going to do this thing that we actually

8
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,660
have not done in quite a long time now

9
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,710
and that is a makeup challenge now a few

10
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,270
weeks ago I was scrolling through Tech

11
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,890
Talk and I saw a really a really cool

12
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,510
video of this moment applying her makeup

13
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,920
using an airbrush machine now if you

14
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,350
don't know what an airbrush machine is

15
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,599
it is this baby right here basically you

16
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:30,330
pouring little drops right into the top

17
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,309
then you turn it on and then you spray

18
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,390
your makeup out on to at the face so

19
00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:34,890
airbrush makeup is actually not

20
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,480
something that is really new to the

21
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,100
beauty world it is most commonly used on

22
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,809
movie sets and special effects makeup

23
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,920
horror film but it is really not a

24
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:42,600
technique that has made its way into

25
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,070
like the typical mainstream Beauty

26
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,930
universe and that is because if you

27
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,329
don't know what you're doing it is very

28
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:50,879
very hard so although it's not new to

29
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:52,260
the makeup world it is new to me and for

30
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,730
today's video I wanted to try out doing

31
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,520
a full face of makeup using only

32
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:58,350
airbrush machines now I wanna be honest

33
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,289
of you guys and tell you that today is

34
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:03,449
my fourth time trying to film this video

35
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:04,710
so usually I do my makeup challenges and

36
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:06,479
you know it's a little bit of a bumpy

37
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:07,920
road but in the end it usually comes

38
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,960
together for this particular video

39
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,670
however it was not doing that it was

40
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,710
literally melting all over my face it

41
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,479
was spotty I could not get it to look

42
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:18,210
good and I just did not understand why I

43
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:19,619
was getting it so ridiculously angry but

44
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:21,330
then I realized okay this is the makeup

45
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:23,070
challenge obviously I cannot be good at

46
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:24,689
everything and instead of just giving up

47
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:27,240
and moving on I want to get this video

48
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:28,950
one last shot so I did some research

49
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,840
watch some videos and called in some

50
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:33,030
backup and we're gonna try this one last

51
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,880
time so if you guys want to watch me

52
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,270
into a full face of airbrush makeup keep

53
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:43,460
on watching

54
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:45,200
[Music]

55
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:47,420
okay guys before we jump in I want to

56
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,010
give it to super quick shout outs the

57
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:50,300
first one being to the brand attempt to

58
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:51,110
you what they are an airbrush company

59
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,550
and they heard that I was doing this

60
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:54,020
video so they sent me over a full

61
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:55,250
package of goodies since all the makeup

62
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,870
stores are closed and during a

63
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:58,190
quarantine that the to do is not

64
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:59,600
sponsored okay I'm not being paid to say

65
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:00,890
anything I do have some products with

66
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,060
other brands as well but I do want to

67
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:03,260
say a major thank you to them and the

68
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,790
second channel is to a channel here on

69
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:07,970
YouTube but by the name of an airbrush

70
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:09,350
MUA by Z G is so incredible and she does

71
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:11,270
the full videos on her channel at using

72
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:13,220
airbrush makeup when I was failing so

73
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:14,570
many times I left a comment on her video

74
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,950
not like if she was gonna see it or not

75
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:18,140
and she literally saw on FaceTime with

76
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:19,250
me for hours the TV at the proper

77
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,690
techniques in showing me what I was

78
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:22,100
doing wrong she even sent over some of

79
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:23,900
her personal colors and machines for me

80
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,730
to youth to try out for today's video so

81
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,930
she is literally an angel she saved this

82
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:28,790
video okay you guys I want you to go

83
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:31,010
check out her channel look for their do

84
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:32,390
okay let's get started

85
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:33,320
so nobody you guys knows my makeup

86
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:35,270
routine I start off with my foundation

87
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,680
first and then go on to eyebrows eyes

88
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:37,730
and the whole shebang for airbrush

89
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,290
makeup we're actually gonna do in the

90
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:41,630
opposite order starting with brows and

91
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:43,610
eyes first because if I mess it up which

92
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:44,690
I very well might it'll be easier to

93
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:46,250
clean up instead of how I would be like

94
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:47,720
the entire base over about being said

95
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,730
let's go ahead and grab our first color

96
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:52,209
which is going to be you know dark brown

97
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:56,410
for our brows we're gonna do three drops

98
00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:59,780
okay so no see if we could go like this

99
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:01,040
there it is with the airbrush you can

100
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,720
obviously just like go in and spray it

101
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,430
which we'll get you later on but for

102
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,930
more specific details it comes with a

103
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:07,400
lot of these really cool stencils which

104
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:08,870
help you get like more accurate lines

105
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,030
and shapes and stuff so I'm gonna grab

106
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:26,450
this fun little brow stencil we're just

107
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:28,610
gonna go right in okay there we go

108
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:33,860
okay yes that looks great okay great now

109
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:37,350
I'm gonna have to do any arch okay now

110
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:42,330
I'm gonna do my tail and this gonna

111
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:52,050
oh okay well I'd like to think that only

112
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:52,710
God but also Jesus shoot chefs are over

113
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:57,050
starting over

114
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:57,050
attempt number three oh this is so hard

115
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:02,490
perfect oh my god perfect perfect for my

116
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,990

00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:06,930

119
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,430
it's all dirty and we're gonna do what's

120
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:12,020
wrong number two okay so I want to make

121
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:12,020
sure that these are even obviously

122
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:18,900
tonight it's not okay

123
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,580
I'm happy with them they could of course

124
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,110
be a little bit better but after trying

125
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:23,130
this for different time I am very happy

126
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:24,330
with these these are by far the best

127
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:26,160
that I have done and I just want to move

128
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,570
on that while we have that so we're

129
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,950
gonna go ahead and move on to the iris

130
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:30,420
of a portion already kind of followed me

131
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,590
right okay I really stated for the I've

132
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:33,180
set of courses because the last few

133
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:35,010
times that I've tried this it wasn't the

134
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,750
skin that I was messing up on I actually

135
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:38,130
really enjoyed it it was the eye shadow

136
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,750
portions because I literally could not

137
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:41,340
get the colors too later on and they are

138
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:44,070
melting they were getting in my eyeballs

139
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:45,180
and my contacts it was not good but I

140
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:46,560
picked up a lot of different techniques

141
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,150
from Ziya that I'm gonna try out today

142
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,830
so hopefully this will work a whole lot

143
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:51,690
better so I'm gonna hold my stencil back

144
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:53,850
up to my skin at once again because I

145
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:56,250
don't want to get any of this color on

146
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:58,080
my actual brow that we just you know

147
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:00,390
we're so hard on but I was gonna go

148
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:05,390
ahead and spray this nice vanilla color

149
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:05,390
on my brow bone to brighten it up oh

150
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:10,980
this excitement probably seems so lame

151
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:17,550
but you guys after trying this so many

152
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:19,260
times on the other eye of all perfect

153
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:20,550
two layers a little bit on my actual

154
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,990
eyelids as well

155
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:23,400
I really Bane the eyelids at almost like

156
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:25,170
dark areas right in this inner corner

157
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,970
for some reason so putting on a light

158
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:28,200
wash will just kind of neutralize that

159
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:29,640
so for my look today I want to do

160
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,260
something a pretty it but nothing too

161
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,940
colorful because if that takes a lot of

162
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:35,130
practice I'm actually gonna grab this

163
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:38,510
nice little shimmery bronze shade first

164
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:40,160
to go my lid very weird I'm gonna use

165
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:43,100
stencil just to avoid getting it on my

166
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,900
face well they're pretty okay there we

167
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,730
go you guys know that I always do while

168
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,930
I'm Cara then while I off you can't work

169
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:49,430
that way with every bus either you have

170
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,810
to do both eyes at the same time to keep

171
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:52,730
your colors consistent to not have to

172
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:54,530
clean the gada a million times so you're

173
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:56,270
in for a treat today same thing on this

174
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:58,640
I wall so for our next color we're now

175
00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:00,230
going to grab a burnt orange shade so

176
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,150
we're gonna do our crease color now this

177
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:03,200
order so strange and this we're gonna be

178
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:04,760
very careful with because we need to

179
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,530
layer this up it's gonna start layering

180
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,590
this in the outer corner and then just

181
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:10,910
pulling this shade up into the crease

182
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:12,290
pretty good like even so far this is

183
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:14,330
looking good okay then I want to darken

184
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:16,490
up my upper corner a little bit so I'm

185
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:18,890
gonna grab it summit dark brown and I'm

186
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:20,060
gonna add in a few drops into the

187
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:24,320
machine and then I'm just going to

188
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:25,580
what's called a back bubbling press it

189
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,500
in there and then mix the colors

190
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:32,470
together some nice bubbling happening in

191
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:35,480
there okay layer this into the outer V

192
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:36,980
this is a million times more fun than

193
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,060
regular eyeshadow are you kidding

194
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,550
so now I'm gonna go back in with a

195
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:41,900
little bit more of my orange color just

196
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:44,510
to bring something with that well this

197
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,800
is really giving it to me right now wer

198
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:49,880
this is like everything that I needed

199
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:51,950
anymore she on the other hand is that's

200
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,150
how my feelings I want to add back a

201
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:54,470
little bit of that shimmery color since

202
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:55,310
it got lost in the blending this is

203
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,540
what's good about airbrushed shoes that

204
00:06:55,310 --> 00:07:01,730
you can layer everything together

205
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:02,960
that's pretty oh wow that's so excited

206
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:04,340
alright you guys so now we get to the

207
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,680
part of this look that could very well

208
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:08,990
ruin act or title together and that is

209
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,370
going to be the eyeliner now if you are

210
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:11,279
like me you're probably thinking how are

211
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:13,229
you gonna do

212
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:14,639
with everybody and you know I'm gonna

213
00:07:13,229 --> 00:07:16,199
show you I thought that this would have

214
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,719
never been possible but then I saw

215
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:20,459
everybody's video where she just you

216
00:07:18,719 --> 00:07:23,759
know went right in surprisingly you can

217
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:24,809
actually get a Barry do you tell mine

218
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,719
with this we're still gonna use our

219
00:07:24,809 --> 00:07:29,369
since all this out and pray that this is

220
00:07:27,719 --> 00:07:31,199
not what takes us down because we do so

221
00:07:29,369 --> 00:07:35,369
good so farms are in the middle of the

222
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:37,229
lid oh my god and then for this area

223
00:07:35,369 --> 00:07:38,549
we're going to continue with the same

224
00:07:37,229 --> 00:07:40,109
shape that we've been doing and we're

225
00:07:38,549 --> 00:07:46,499
going to use this to darken up very

226
00:07:40,109 --> 00:07:47,610
lightly oh my god I light up with

227
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:49,289
airbrush who would have thought it would

228
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:51,299
be possible not me I'll take that right

229
00:07:49,289 --> 00:07:54,029
now let's try this again on the other

230
00:07:51,299 --> 00:07:54,929
eye perfect I think I'm happy without I

231
00:07:54,029 --> 00:07:56,610
don't think I want to go any further

232
00:07:54,929 --> 00:07:59,009
okay great so that is converse the eye

233
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:00,059
shadow portion of this look all complete

234
00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:01,799
of course we can add on the brow bone

235
00:08:00,059 --> 00:08:03,539
highlight and lashes a little bit later

236
00:08:01,799 --> 00:08:05,249
on to look just because I don't want to

237
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:06,389
mess anything up but before we go on to

238
00:08:05,249 --> 00:08:07,949
the foundation I'm gonna quickly take

239
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:11,489
just a makeup wipe and we're gonna clean

240
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:13,799
up this bottom edge that looks gorgeous

241
00:08:11,489 --> 00:08:14,879
okay same thing on the side I know that

242
00:08:13,799 --> 00:08:16,019
I was getting so excited and literally

243
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,029
screaming throughout this entire portion

244
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:19,860
but after so when he tries okay it feels

245
00:08:18,029 --> 00:08:21,869
really good to just get something that

246
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:23,579
actually looks presentable on the eyes I

247
00:08:21,869 --> 00:08:24,809
feel like I'm finally succeeding at this

248
00:08:23,579 --> 00:08:26,219
makeup challenge and now it is time to

249
00:08:24,809 --> 00:08:27,959
move on to our next step which is going

250
00:08:26,219 --> 00:08:29,459
to be a foundation and so it should be a

251
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:30,869
little bit of smoother sailing from here

252
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:32,459
on all right so now it is time for our

253
00:08:30,869 --> 00:08:33,870
foundation and I have two colors here

254
00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:35,669
that I'm going to mix together

255
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:36,959
Foundation is definitely what I'm most

256
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:38,789
excited about and also like what

257
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:39,990
airbrush makeup is kind of most commonly

258
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:41,399
used for especially with like weddings

259
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:42,599
because obviously your toes to look like

260
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:44,459
airbrush and it's just like looks

261
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:45,990
flawless all blended together so I'm

262
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:48,569
really pumped for this stop I'm gonna

263
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:50,309
grab one of my straight edge stencils so

264
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:51,809
I can do this portion if I have a shoe

265
00:08:50,309 --> 00:08:55,500
that actually messing up any of the work

266
00:08:51,809 --> 00:08:57,689
that we just did well I really really am

267
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,279
obsessed with how this covered look it's

268
00:08:57,689 --> 00:09:03,660
very much like your skin but better type

269
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:05,220
of on deal you can still see my freckles

270
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,640
and beauty marks poking through which

271
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,980
personally I

272
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,570
love like 23 foundation with airbrush

273
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:13,510
all the time are you kidding

274
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:14,649
okay let's doing that too okay I think

275
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:16,660
it's done

276
00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:18,970
not as time to contour I'm gonna grab a

277
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:21,130
few drops of this clock called hazelnuts

278
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:24,640
zis a way to hold this really a really

279
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:32,440
far away what I'm going to do that's a

280
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:33,850
little bit dark oh okay why is wow this

281
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,779
is my bad type and this one's coming out

282
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:38,769
so much better today

283
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:41,290
okay okay little harsh oh god this bout

284
00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:44,890
looks bad we're gonna layer some

285
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:46,779
foundation back over top of that it's

286
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:50,190
just looks gray now what I do

287
00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:50,190
should I just wipe off this area though

288
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:04,300
okay that definitely helped oh wow

289
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:05,800
well no way liners gray though once

290
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,209
again I'm gonna cut cameras for a minute

291
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,209
get back to where I was then we're gonna

292
00:10:07,209 --> 00:10:11,860
recontour I'll be back okay hello when

293
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:13,209
you're back i touched up the foundation

294
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,529
got the eyeliner back to where it wise

295
00:10:13,209 --> 00:10:16,089
we're just how to contour it once again

296
00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:18,160
and this time we're gonna literally hold

297
00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:19,750
this 8,000 miles away okay that's not

298
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,670
that bad I think with bronzer and blush

299
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:24,880
over top of a no look it'll like come

300
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:26,320
together now decide for blush I'm really

301
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,490
hoping that this will like pull together

302
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,050
at the contour a little bit I'm gonna

303
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:31,120
start on my right hand side which

304
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:35,440
apparently today is a better side that

305
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:37,810
looks yellow now to this side oh forgot

306
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,269
your nose contour that's scary

307
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:42,040
my big ass nose okay I'm just coming I

308
00:10:40,269 --> 00:10:42,579
can't even listen that okay no nose

309
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,110
contour

310
00:10:42,579 --> 00:10:45,790
on the highlight let's go this is the

311
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:48,070
final stretch you guys we're doing good

312
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:50,019
let me out a little bit on the brow

313
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:53,670
bones should I try to do my inner

314
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:53,670
corners or is that like risking it

315
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:59,320
that's good okay oh my god oh my god you

316
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:00,880
guys well I think at this point we can

317
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,890
turn off our airbrush machine because

318
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,480
we're dying but we do have two long

319
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:06,540
steps to do which is going to be it just

320
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,610
of course the eyelashes and then

321
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:11,280
all right you guys we'll finally after

322
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:13,500
three attempts it looks like four times

323
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:15,630
is the charm four wines because that is

324
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:20,040
a fullface using only airbrush makeup

325
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:21,540
all complete I am incredibly happy and

today it is not perfect in any way shape

328
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,460
or form okay I'm not claiming it to me

329
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,290
but in comparison to the other three

330
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:31,320
times that I film is okay this looks

00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:33,330
