7
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,359
to Los Angeles in to this apartment

8
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:25,680
I've been saying I'm gonna do an

9
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:28,230
apartment tour and guess what I have not

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,109
done an apartment door I've been here

11
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:33,180
for about a year and a half now I like

12
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:34,320
it I definitely do not love it and that

13
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,059
is why I wanted to do the apartment tour

14
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,000
today because I'm gonna show you guys my

15
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:41,570
little sister suite my sister shelter

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,530
but I'm Carly in the market for a sister

17
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:45,360
sanctuary which will be a house

18
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,370
hopefully in the very very near future

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,379
it has been a huge goal of mine I really

20
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:51,059
really love architecture interior design

21
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:52,020
it's when I fear things in the entire

22
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:54,449
world I feel like I've done a pretty

23
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,829
pretty decent job at this apartment and

24
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:56,940
I'm not gonna be here for much longer so

25
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:58,199
I'm gonna show you guys what I've done

26
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,220
with the place I'm really really proud

27
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:03,360
of it and I hope you guys enjoy it too

28
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:03,360
[Music]

29
00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:07,770
so as soon as you walk into the sister

30
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,380
shelter we have the kitchen which is

31
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:12,150
probably by far the least used place of

32
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,830
the entire house but of course we do

33
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,960
have our regular stove our microwave

34
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,430
where I cook ramen in our dishwasher

35
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,540
which does not get used very often

36
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,590
because we have paper plates

37
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,950
and then over here we have this like

38
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:24,990
weird little breakfast nook cabinet

39
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,420
situation on this wall I really really

40
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,710
love burning candles the sister sense of

41
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,079
down panel I can sometimes be a little

42
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,700
bit so stir spooky so I definitely loved

43
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:34,110
light candle then I have my little Bowl

44
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,880
that house my earpods my wallet and my

45
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,500
keys because I'm always losing I miss

46
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,729
placing them so I figured might as well

47
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,500
just put them there on my toaster oven

48
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:41,850
if I ever cook avocado toast and then

49
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,049
just a coffee machine it so I can make

50
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:46,259
my coffee in the morning with of course

51
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:47,579
my good morning sisters mug for Lima

52
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:49,140
home so although we don't do a lot of

53
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:52,290
cooking it you guys know I definitely do

54
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:54,030
- a lot of eating that is for sure I am

55
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,770
definitely a foodie i order from so many

56
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,180
restaurants in LA and I'm always having

57
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,100
friends over here so having a really

58
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,659
really nice dining set up for all my

59
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,399
friends and family to eat while they're

60
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:04,170
together is a very very important part

61
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,490
of this house disclaimer most of this

62
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:07,860
furniture and this property is actually

63
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:09,479
from Ikea the city was not hashtag

64
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,009
sponsored but at hashtag should be

65
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,629
because when I buy my sister sanctuary

66
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:13,380
in case you did not know real estate in

67
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:14,970
Los Angeles

68
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:16,980
exactly in the cheapest so a Cicero is

69
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:18,450
going to be broke so IKEA if you want to

70
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,310
hit a girl up I'd love to have you

71
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:22,860
furnished the new sister's house when I

72
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:24,000
get it regardless I just have these

73
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,160
place settings on here that I got from

74
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,300
CV to this cute little bench so a bunch

75
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,700
of people can sit on here and we can

76
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,680
sister squeeze wow so many good sister

77
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,000
fruits that I like I said I definitely

78
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,070
have had a huge interested in interior

79
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,240
design since I've been very very little

80
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,920
I'm a huge fan of Pinterest

81
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,060
I literally have boards and boards and

82
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,800
boards and boards of different

83
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,300
inspiration photos and these chairs have

84
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,460
actually been on my like a wish list

85
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,440
since I was literally like 11 or 12

86
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,820
years old swear to god I'm not kidding

87
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,350
so the second that I moved into this

88
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:51,090
house I ordered a ton of these chairs

89
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:53,130
they are super super comfortable and I

90
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:54,810
use them for a dining purposes above the

91
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:56,430
13 people we have two very very large

92
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:57,750
hanging light pendants when I moved in

93
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,070
here we literally had to get a 20-foot

94
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,750
ladder and climb all the way up to the

95
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:03,270
sister ceiling to install these light

96
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,950
but I love love love how they look and

97
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:06,840
it was definitely very much worth it and

98
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:08,370
I'm definitely not climbing up there

99
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,280
again when I move out so hopefully the

100
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:12,420
next tenants like these lights and then

101
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,160
finally on the wall we just have these

102
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,320
two posters which I absolutely love

103
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,300
once again from Ikea the first one is

104
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,980
from Andy Warhol from the Modena musi in

105
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,180
Stockholm Sweden this has been a huge I

106
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,960
don't my voice let's forever I have a

107
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,490
bunch of them all throughout my

108
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,690
apartment I really really love Andy

109
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:26,820
Warhol as well I think he's a very very

110
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:28,920
inspiring artist and then my favorite

111
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,790
quote of all time work smarter not

112
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,170
harder

113
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:32,850
that is like my all-time a favorite

114
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,860
quote to live by I say all the time it

115
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:36,360
is my phone wallpaper connected to the

116
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:38,430
dining room was actually obviously the

117
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,780
kitchen it but also the living room and

118
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:42,300
the office where I get all of my work

119
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:44,190
done throughout the day so along this

120
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,780
wall we have a bathroom right over here

121
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:47,810
which we don't need to go into this is

122
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:50,310
why I sister you don't need to see that

123
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:51,570
along this wall we have our office and

124
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:53,220
this is probably one of my favorite

125
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:54,630
walls in the entire house because this

126
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,800
is where I'm spending most of my time so

127
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:57,900
I really want to make sure it was super

128
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,610
super cute and a space that inspired me

129
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,830
so once again I have my little table

130
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:03,209
from Ikea and of course the Alex drawers

131
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,770
of course you guys know with my job we

132
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:06,660
have to say very very connected all

133
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:08,760
throughout the day it is vital to the

134
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:10,620
existence of me and all your sisters out

135
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,900
there so this is where all the work gets

136
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:15,300
done we have my huge iMac which I love

137
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,920
love love working and editing on we have

138
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,840
my phone charger an Apple watch charger

139
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,580
and then my laptop for work on the go

140
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,200
and then my sister I've had which I

141
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:23,280
always used for taking notes sketching

142
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,080
things down and just planning out

143
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,700
different video concepts when decorating

144
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,090
I knew I wanted to put the desk there

145
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,370
but that

146
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:31,080
left a very very large and kind of

147
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:33,240
awkward wall space that I knew I needed

148
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,729
to fill so I feel like a pretty good

149
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,470
design tip queen of HGTV and spill it

150
00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:38,790
with a very very large buck face and

151
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:40,860
lots of different decor pieces and that

152
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:42,060
is exactly what I did I have a printer

153
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,590
right next my computer so I can print

154
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,880
out any files or contracts that I need

155
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:45,990
you to sign some different books my

156
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,400
favorite youtubers I have a few

157
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:48,419
different awards this is from the Shorty

158
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,340
Awards when I want it for break out

159
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:51,660
youtuber last year Thank You sisters for

160
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:54,090
always being the absolute best of course

161
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:57,330
I have this little ampersand because I'm

162
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:58,979
an internet relatable team and then once

163
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:00,360
again to some little plants here and

164
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:01,830
there to keep everything alive so

165
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,750
obviously all my work gets done in my

166
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:05,130
office but if we move just right over

167
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,660
here to the living room and this is

168
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:08,310
where all the fun that starts to happen

169
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,660
I'm actually very proud of how this room

170
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:11,610
turned out because decorating it was a

171
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:13,169
little bit of a challenge when I moved

172
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:15,240
in here obviously a lot of the walls are

173
00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:16,979
white on the inside but all the outside

174
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,750
walls because this was a cornered unit

175
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:20,280
are made out of brick which makes

176
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:22,260
decorating it so incredibly hard because

177
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,600
not very many things match with burnt

178
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:26,160
orange a red tones I try to convince a

179
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,960
building's help me paint it white they

180
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,610
would not budge I don't blame them it's

181
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,380
still a little bit sister selfie about

182
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:32,850
it but I feel like I did my absolute

183
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:35,370
best so of course we just have this very

184
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:37,740
very large and extremely comfy couch

185
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:39,300
from Ikea we have lots of different gray

186
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,160
at white and black throw pillows to add

187
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,900
just a little personal Flair and to make

188
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:46,139
light here a lot more comfortable

189
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:50,310
I've taken a so many sister siestas

190
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:52,110
that's a nap in Spanish I'm so cheesy up

191
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:53,280
in this couch of course in the middle of

192
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:55,470
the living room we have this little like

193
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,090
coffee table that I got once again from

194
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:58,349
Ikea and I'm not having like a full-on

195
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:00,330
meal and if I'm having more of a little

196
00:05:58,349 --> 00:06:01,979
bit of a lazy day I'll sometimes eat on

197
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:03,360
here or put my feet up if you may have

198
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:05,250
noticed in this apartment I actually do

199
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,099
not have a TV and that is because

200
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:09,780
instead of a TV I have a projector which

201
00:06:08,099 --> 00:06:11,520
is probably literally the best decision

202
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,810
that I ever made in my entire life I

203
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,180
have it right under here on the bottom

204
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:24,120
shelf and it projects right over to here

205
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:25,830
a big screen that pulls down right above

206
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,360
my office I actually really really love

207
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:29,460
having a projector instead of a TV

208
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,800
because it relies on the lack of light

209
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:33,210
obviously work hello

210
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,650
so it forces me to get my work done

211
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:36,150
during the day because I can't use it

212
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:37,440
and then at night once they have

213
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:39,060
everything done and I'm hanging out with

214
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,460
friends I can always pull this down

215
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,990
watch on Netflix on my Apple TV

216
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,250
I also have an Xbox down here which I

217
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:46,110
got for the sole purpose of playing a

218
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:49,290
black ops zombies literally the queen

219
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:51,690
event and a Wii which literally hello

220
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:53,610
and nostalgic memories I will crush you

221
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:56,430
in Mario Kart if you ever come over and

222
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:57,420
that is a promise moving right along we

223
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:58,650
probably have the part of the apartment

224
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:00,750
that you guys have seen the absolute

225
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:04,080
most from a snapchat and Instagram

226
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:06,510
stories and that is the sister selfie

227
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:09,060
mirror I literally love this huge

228
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:10,860
oversized mirror once again from Ikea

229
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,360
the lighting is literally the best here

230
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,800
because it's actually in the corner of

231
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,840
the apartment so there's light coming

232
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,760
from both this window and this window

233
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,340
which makes my highlight reflect on both

234
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,570
sides which is literally so good so

235
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,340
fresh as you can see I definitely have a

236
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:25,260
lot of plants in here I really really

237
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:27,000
love the look of greenery and plants but

238
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:28,710
they're all fake because literally every

239
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,060
plant or flower that I've ever owned in

240
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:31,200
my entire life has died and then last

241
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:33,270
but certainly not least we just have my

242
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:35,580
little keyboard sitting here on the

243
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:36,870
floor it's so sad looking literally one

244
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,640
of the first things that I buy when I

245
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:41,190
get my new sister sanctuary is going to

246
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:43,710
be a huge huge huge professional

247
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:45,120
beautiful grand piano I literally cannot

248
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:46,050
wait but for right now we'll just have

249
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,700
to deal with this keyboard that I got

250
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:49,110
from Amazon but whenever I want to learn

251
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:51,600
to practice a new song that I'm loving

252
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:53,820
or at work on something myself who knows

253
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,870
what the future holds in case you missed

254
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:57,630
it which I really don't know how you

255
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:58,950
would because it is up sleek huge right

256
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:01,530
smack that Woodinville the living room

257
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:03,330
it's just insanely beautiful spiral

258
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:04,740
staircase which I am literally so in

259
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:06,090
love with and is actually one of the

260
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,650
main reasons I caught this apartment in

261
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,850
the first place when I was growing up

262
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:10,740
for some reason I've always had a huge

263
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:11,820
infatuation first tile staircases I

264
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,260
always just thought they were so cool

265
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:15,090
and I'm gonna miss this a lot when I

266
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,560
move out but this apartment is actually

267
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:18,240
two different stories so of course we

268
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,470
have the bottom level the living room

269
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,670
with the kitchen the filming room and

270
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:22,170
the closet which we're gonna get into a

271
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:24,240
little bit later and I'm so excited to

272
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:25,830
show you guys but upstairs we have of

273
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,920
the loft and that is where I get my

274
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:30,810
sister sleep so let's go up there I've

275
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:33,780
actually never fallen down this thank

276
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:35,550
God but several of my friends have sorry

277
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,719
who's loved you the most the main

278
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:38,460
problem with the upstairs area is that

279
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,680
there's no window up here which is so

280
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:42,060
beyond fresh shooting I only have one

281
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,490
little string of lights above my bed

282
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:45,780
which do very very little and it also

283
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,890
gets really really hot up here too

284
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:49,589
because obviously we're on the second

285
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:52,560
floor and heat rises it can sometimes be

286
00:08:49,589 --> 00:08:54,660
a little bit sisters sweaty at night but

287
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,870
I still do love this base I think having

288
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,580
a

289
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:58,230
locked bedroom is so cool because

290
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:00,120
obviously we have the railings and I get

291
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:01,770
to look over everything kind of see the

292
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,660
full apartment which is such an insane a

293
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:07,470
beautiful view and if I ever have a home

294
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:10,140
intruder I can Scizor spot them before I

295
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:11,490
die of course we have my bed at right

296
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:13,200
here in the middle with some white bed

297
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:14,430
teeth just to match the aesthetic we

298
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,740
have a little bit of a blanket once

299
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:18,390
again for the LA winters if it gets cold

300
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:20,070
those little table lamp that I have next

301
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:21,660
to my bed I really really love this it's

302
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,770
just super cute and it's bendable so I

303
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:26,040
can kind of move it in any direction

304
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:28,560
that I want it to a large Jay painting

305
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,820
because I'm doing like I said I don't

306
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,040
really put that much time up here anyway

307
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:34,589
just to a sister sleep and occasionally

308
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:36,300
sisters talk and then moving down the

309
00:09:34,589 --> 00:09:37,890
sister style staircase of course we have

310
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,750
a dis door right here which leads to the

311
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:41,670
closet I'm gonna save this room for last

312
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,870
because by far the best of the entire

313
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:45,060
house and I am so excited to show you

314
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:47,580
guys that but if we walk right across

315
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:49,170
the living room and dining room we get

316
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,610
to this door right here which you guys

317
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:51,870
may have seen in videos a few times but

318
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:53,910
I've never really given you the Grand

319
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:54,630
Tour and this is where all the magic

320
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:57,660
happens

321
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:59,310
the sister studio I'm so good at as soon

322
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,450
as you walk in in the main space once

323
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:02,130
again we have a very very large

324
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:03,779
bookshelf we just have a few different

325
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:05,370
knickknacks some picture frames these

326
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:06,540
pictures of me my best friend Laura and

327
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:08,100
the entire world we have this little

328
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,810
poster that my mom made me saying makeup

329
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,790
is my art you guys are gonna say that in

330
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:13,110
every video at this point before we get

331
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:14,790
a few different candles at different

332
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:16,410
plants some storage items we have my

333
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:18,180
Amazon Alexa so I can always listen to

334
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:19,740
music while I'm getting glam hashtag now

335
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:21,390
sponsored by Amazon's go ahead a sister

336
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,130
up I love to do a brand deal with you

337
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:24,360
guys and then down at the bottom we just

338
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:26,520
have a bunch of different equipment from

339
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,529
audio recording stuff to SD cards

340
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,970
batteries different cords different

341
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:31,800
chargers different lenses different

342
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:33,570
cameras this is like my videographers

343
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,100
dream area of the house and she keeps

344
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:36,330
everything there so you can say it's

345
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,800
super organized and get ready whenever

346
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:39,300
we're being issued during the day I've

347
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,430
been moving this way once again we have

348
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,990
the dream studio and for some reason not

349
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:44,430
a lot of GD gurus like to show this I

350
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:45,900
think it's because getting a perfect

351
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:47,910
lighting setup is obviously a very very

352
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:49,170
difficult thing it took me a lot of

353
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:51,300
trial and error and a lot of different

354
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:52,529
really really ugly looking videos but I

355
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,640
finally have a setup that I am super

356
00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:55,320
proud of so this is kind of what it

357
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,640
looks like this camera and lens and

358
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,250
lighting setup not gonna lie was

359
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,020
extraordinarily expensive it really bit

360
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:02,220
my bank account for a hot minute but

361
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:04,140
I've been saving up for it for a very

362
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:05,459
very long time and like I said having my

363
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,480
video quality be the absolute best I

364
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:07,560
could be for you guys or something it's

365
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,200
always been it very very important to me

366
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,149
so it was down

367
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,889
worth the investment clearly all this

368
00:11:10,149 --> 00:11:13,300
equipment together isn't exactly the

369
00:11:11,889 --> 00:11:16,060
prettiest it's definitely pretty pretty

370
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:18,279
cluttered and busy in here but all these

371
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:20,110
items work very very nicely together

372
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:23,110
so when I sit down I feel me using a

373
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:25,690
video this is what it looks like and

374
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:27,790
like I said this is taking me years to

375
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:29,769
get to this quality but I am finally so

376
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:30,850
beyond happy with the camera quality of

377
00:11:29,769 --> 00:11:32,769
my youtube videos and this is what you

378
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:34,660
guys see and every single sister James

379
00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:35,980
Channel video when I'm actually sitting

380
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,690
down to film this is what the general

381
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:39,220
setup looks like right in front of me I

382
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:41,139
have my makeup table once again from

383
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:42,550
Ikea I have a trash bin below for all my

384
00:11:41,139 --> 00:11:44,230
last crises and my makeup wipes that I

385
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:45,760
use and my drawer here I just have a

386
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:47,529
bunch of different mix-match stuff from

387
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,910
it different handheld mirrors fixed paws

388
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:50,769
some makeup lights and of course all my

389
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:53,110
little tools like my tweezers my beauty

390
00:11:50,769 --> 00:11:55,329
blenders or little scissors to cut my

391
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:57,339
lashes I of course my makeup brushes

392
00:11:55,329 --> 00:11:58,540
over here I have this big standing

393
00:11:57,339 --> 00:12:00,279
mirror right here on the corner of the

394
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:01,630
table that isn't in the camera frame but

395
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:02,980
I can definitely still see myself and

396
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:04,600
then on the other side we have this

397
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:06,550
beautiful TV monitor which is suspended

398
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,959
from one of the light poles and this

399
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:09,220
actually is connected to my camera so

400
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:10,420
I'm able to see myself live and make

401
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,620
sure that my angles are good the

402
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,730
lighting is good and to see if it stops

403
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:14,500
recording so this is kind of how

404
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:16,000
everything works together to really

405
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,649
create our really really awesome YouTube

406
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,269
video right above me when I'm filming a

407
00:12:17,649 --> 00:12:21,310
video I have this boom microphone and

408
00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:22,510
this catches all the sisters sound and

409
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:24,040
then behind the one I feel of course

410
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:25,120
have my backdrop so you guys know why

411
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,680
YouTube videos are always stoned at home

412
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,790
too based all on a white wall and over

413
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:32,050
here we have the holy grail closet tada

414
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:33,579
the makeup you guys have definitely seen

415
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:35,350
some vlog style clips of this kind of

416
00:12:33,579 --> 00:12:36,699
general makeup storage area and I was

417
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:38,529
originally planning on doing a full on

418
00:12:36,699 --> 00:12:39,880
like makeup collection tour because it's

419
00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:41,470
like every beauty guru ever and the

420
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,490
entire broth has done that but I

421
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,019
literally got to the point where my

422
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:46,209
collection was completely overflowing

423
00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:48,430
which was definitely not cute at all so

424
00:12:46,209 --> 00:12:50,470
I actually went through and got rid of

425
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:52,510
and by got rid of I mean donated like

426
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:53,800
90% of my makeup collection and now I

427
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:55,390
kind of only had my like favorite

428
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:58,000
products that I reached for on an

429
00:12:55,390 --> 00:13:00,699
everyday basis and it honestly feels so

430
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,769
so so good so I think I can just kind of

431
00:13:00,699 --> 00:13:03,970
go over in general what I have of course

432
00:13:02,769 --> 00:13:05,829
I have that setting space up here

433
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:08,860
Beauty blenders lashes different skin

434
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:10,779
care foundations tanners powders blushes

435
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:12,699
and bronzers concealers and he dragged

436
00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:15,279
or like more art type makeup looks

437
00:13:12,699 --> 00:13:17,649
glitters more glitters liners brows

438
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:19,449
highlighters lip liners and a regular

439
00:13:17,649 --> 00:13:20,830
lipsticks liquid lipsticks lip glosses

440
00:13:19,449 --> 00:13:22,990
some single eyeshadows

441
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:24,430
and makeup cleansing wipes down here I

442
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:26,050
have ISIL up health and down here I have

443
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:27,280
more excess lashes for a beauty guru I

444
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:28,360
feel like this is a very very small

445
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,070
collection and for me

446
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,570
having everything nicely organized and

447
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:33,040
all together makes it so easy for me to

448
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:34,450
pick out makeup before I'm doing a look

449
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,100
before I'm filming or if I'm putting

450
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:37,540
something together so I really really

451
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,760
love the system that I have going on

452
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:41,590
thank you to its sister desi Perkins for

453
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,940
the organization tips she did a full

454
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:45,070
video on her beauty room tour and this

455
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:47,500
is literally it's so insanely helpful

456
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:49,450
and these make organizing everything so

457
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:51,190
incredibly easy and really really easily

458
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:52,600
accessible on this top shelf I have at

459
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:54,160
various different wigs from whenever I'm

460
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,290
feeling Maya and dragged fantasy and

461
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,970
want to go from a brother to a true

462
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:59,260
sister these are so fun and they're just

463
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,880
displayed on these little styrofoam

464
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:02,080
heads and then right next to it the

465
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,790
makeup storage I have my youtube

466
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,290
subscriber plaques which are probably my

467
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:06,610
most prized possession of all time I

468
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:07,690
cannot wait to get a house and display

469
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:11,050
this literally in the front

470
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:12,550
walk-in hallway to say yes that's me but

471
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:14,320
I'm so proud of these and I keep these

472
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:15,850
where I see them every single day in the

473
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,710
make up filming room I love this room

474
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:18,970
I'm here majority of my time so I really

475
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:22,030
wanted to make it really really special

476
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:24,250
and really really cute obviously but I

477
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:25,660
think it's finally time to move on to it

478
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,800
the last room of the house if you follow

479
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:29,650
me this way out right across the

480
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:33,850
apartment we have probably my favorite

481
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:35,530
room in the entire house oh this is the

482
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:36,700
walk-in closet the first thing that you

483
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:38,290
see when you walk in is of course this

484
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:40,030
huge holding rocker right here and on

485
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:42,160
here is all the items from sisters

486
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:43,450
apparel displayed a loud and proud

487
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,340
obviously fans know you can get all your

488
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:47,440
sister's merch and gear as sisters -

489
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:49,090
apparel calm right here on this wall

490
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,160
once again we have another large selfie

491
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:52,210
mirror if I put on a new outfit at ways

492
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,740
like to stay here and pose in front of

493
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:55,810
it and see if it looks good on me if it

494
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:58,630
frames the body well if the fine is

495
00:14:55,810 --> 00:15:01,900
looking good or flat it's usually

496
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:03,880
looking flat but I can see it right here

497
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:07,120
I custom designed this entire storage

498
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:09,430
unit from Ikea once again not sponsored

499
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,510
but literally so good they actually have

500
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:12,370
a thing on their website where you can

501
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:13,630
put in the dimensions of your room with

502
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:16,510
walls and doors and everything and

503
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:17,650
design a full-on closet storage thing so

504
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:20,080
this is actually what I was able to come

505
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:22,390
up with and I am literally so happy with

506
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:23,770
it so proud it just stores everything so

507
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:25,600
efficiently and I'm able to organize

508
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:27,430
that really really well so and then I

509
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,990
only have this beautiful leather pouf

510
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:30,760
which is great for sitting on if I have

511
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:32,530
any friends over if I have my stylist or

512
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,120
designer over helping with outfits they

513
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:34,449
can sit right here and sometimes because

514
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,009
the bow

515
00:15:34,449 --> 00:15:37,119
was right there I'll come out of the

516
00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:39,040
shower and fall asleep on here

517
00:15:37,119 --> 00:15:40,689
butt-naked it's very very comfortable

518
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,249
that was probably too much information

519
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:44,379
you didn't need to know that regardless

520
00:15:42,249 --> 00:15:46,389
the poof I think I ordered this from

521
00:15:44,379 --> 00:15:48,869
Amazon I believe and then of course a

522
00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:51,249
just little carpets what's sisters soft

523
00:15:48,869 --> 00:15:53,049
right here the first storage area I have

524
00:15:51,249 --> 00:15:54,999
our shoes and like I said I really

525
00:15:53,049 --> 00:15:56,980
really love shoes starting at the top I

526
00:15:54,999 --> 00:15:59,559
have all my boots from my wire cells my

527
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:01,299
Louboutins some timberlands some Yeezys

528
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:03,009
that runs different mix-and-match shoes

529
00:16:01,299 --> 00:16:04,600
for the most part they're all adidas I

530
00:16:03,009 --> 00:16:05,980
absolutely love adidas you guys know

531
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,619
where it literally all the time from

532
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:10,269
shoes shirts and jackets everything and

533
00:16:08,619 --> 00:16:11,949
then of course we have my everyday go to

534
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:13,569
the Balenciaga switch you can see me

535
00:16:11,949 --> 00:16:14,980
wear it almost every single picture I'm

536
00:16:13,569 --> 00:16:17,109
sorry they're really really comfortable

537
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:18,249
and they're super cute we have a cute

538
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:19,660
little sister's poster and then I feel

539
00:16:18,249 --> 00:16:21,369
like her bag I think literally every

540
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:23,169
beauty guru ever has like 80 million

541
00:16:21,369 --> 00:16:25,449
Chanel bags little purses

542
00:16:23,169 --> 00:16:27,309
do you are a Louie Vuitton and the top

543
00:16:25,449 --> 00:16:28,600
traders have some accessories I don't

544
00:16:27,309 --> 00:16:30,669
really wear that many of them so I don't

545
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,109
have this drawer like very very fall but

546
00:16:30,669 --> 00:16:33,519
definitely nice just to have them just

547
00:16:32,109 --> 00:16:34,869

Vuitton and then of course my bracelets

551
00:16:37,749 --> 00:16:41,470
that are way too expensive but I've

552
00:16:39,549 --> 00:16:43,179
saved up for my entire life and I've

553
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:45,399
definitely been a beauty guru staple

554
00:16:43,179 --> 00:16:46,419
item that everybody has so I don't

555
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:48,249
really have them in accessories but

556
00:16:46,419 --> 00:16:49,869

563
00:16:56,709 --> 00:17:00,759
terrible and these faithful hats were

564
00:16:58,419 --> 00:17:02,529
glued to my head I just loved the way I

565
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:03,039
looked in them most of because I hated

566
00:17:02,529 --> 00:17:05,319
the way I looked

567
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:07,149

I love a good jumper that I feel so good

572
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:18,189
so powerful so like street wear ninja

573
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:20,110

00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:37,059
wearing suits so I don't really have too

582
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:38,620

00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,220
sweatshirts jackets and hoodies

591
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:52,630
obviously you guys have seen a general

592
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:54,220
theme with me I don't really like to

593
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:55,540
dress up that often but I can still rock

594
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:57,040
a really really beautiful it's lame look

595
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,670
and make it sophisticated with a

596
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,040
sweatshirt

597
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:01,090
it just works trust me obviously you

598
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:03,070
guys can see that I have a very very

599
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:05,530
strict color scheme when it comes to my

600
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:06,790
outfit being white and black and gray

601
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:08,770
okay see I'll throw in a little bit of

602
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:10,570
color which is all stored in this drawer

603
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:12,700
right over here but that is very very

604
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:13,960
few and far in between so so doing over

605
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:16,300
here we have all the white and gray

606
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,800
pieces once again mostly sweaters I have

my underwear and socks drawer over here

608
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,740
what you definitely do not need to see

609
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:22,900
and then just some various different

610
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:26,140
t-shirts which are not very organized

611
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:27,610
but they're there just in case I want

612
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,960
them I really love this middle section

613
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:30,520
this is where I keep all of my different

614
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,170
jackets and kind of like more heavy

615
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,850
pieces so I have like 87 million

616
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:35,410
different denim jackets I absolutely

617
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:37,150
love them and a few different pieces

618
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:39,130
that are custom made by one of my fan

619
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:40,720
pages salads our illustration he paints

620
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:42,010
my face on the back of jackets hello

621
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,080
that is the coolest thing in the entire

622
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:45,370
world I love these so so so much I

623
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,800
always keep them right there in case I

624
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:49,480
want to once again so promo a little bit

625
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,220
because something wrong with that some

626
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:54,100
green or camo jacket and then a whole

627
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:56,170
lot of some block farmer jackets some

628
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:58,660
cropped jacket some adidas jackets

629
00:18:56,170 --> 00:19:00,670
champion Chanel YSL everything is kind

630
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:02,170
of in there if it's an outerwear type of

631
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:04,390
piece in this top drawer I have my

632
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:05,650
sister shorts when it gets hot in LA I

633
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:06,730
don't really have that many pairs them

634
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:08,650
because I just don't really like the way

635
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:09,940
I look in shorts but I just found these

636
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:11,950
recently which I feel a little it's so

637
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,210
cute and how loud they're like boyfriend

638
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:14,530
Schwartz but you know what's not cute

639
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:16,660
the fact that I don't have a boyfriend

640
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:18,580
and the second drawer down I have all my

641
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:20,260
pants and I've been obsessed with

642
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:21,460
getting really really cool pants

643
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:23,560
recently for some reason I don't know

644
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:26,590
why it's just so fun I literally used to

645
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:29,890
wear black skinny jeans every single day

646
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:31,780
I probably have like 30 pairs of just

647
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:33,430
blocks and jeans literally or right here

648
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:35,290
they're all from Laura's boutique use

649
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:36,850
code days for 10% off they fit amazingly

650
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:38,260
but I was just getting so bored of them

651
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:39,280
and I looked the exact same every single

652
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,690
day I've been trying to spice it up a

653
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,760
lot recently and then in this drawer we

654
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:44,050
just have my sweat shorts which I would

655
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,060
wear if I was ever gonna work out which

656
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:47,920
I'm not let's be real so the stores

657
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:49,630
probably completely who's this and then

658
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,250
a few different two-piece sets and then

659
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:54,550
finally on the bottom we have my like

660
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:56,500
sweat pants slash casual pants type of

661
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:57,820
drawer I love this Shore this is where I

662
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,260
keep all my adidas track pants that I

663
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:00,900
wear all the time and some different

664
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:03,150
Corp and pieces that I've been upset

665
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,830
- recently as you can see I definitely

666
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:06,330
like a very very casual item I like to

667
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:07,920
be very very comfortable while still

668
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:09,390
spicing up the office somehow and then

669
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,740
finally last but not least the last

670
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:12,630
section of the closet is all the way in

671
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:14,820
the back or right here and this is where

672
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:15,810
I keep all of my block pieces and I know

673
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:17,310
it looks a little bit barren right now

674
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:18,960
almost everything is in the wash

675
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:19,980
I picked a very very bad time to fill my

676
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,720
closet tour but you know what we're

677
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,950
gonna make it work obviously you guys

678
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,330
know that I wear a hold on a block so

679
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:26,910
this section is literally usually like

680
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:28,020
filled to the freakin brim but there's

681
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:29,670
just some really cool pieces out here

682
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,840
like about geography a few different

683
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:32,610
crystal pieces that I haven't worn yet

684
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,770
some unreleased this is apparel items

685
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:36,060
what could that be I don't know and then

686
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:37,920
just some fun pieces like this a furry

687
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:40,050
jacket but for the most part I think

688
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,970
that's actually it for the closet tour

689
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:43,380
like I said I definitely will go more in

690
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:45,690
depth in a future video when I move into

691
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:48,030
the new house but that's everything I

692
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:49,320
think we're done already sisters I think

693
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:51,000
that is it for this apartment tour today

694
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,230
I really really hope you guys enjoyed it

695
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,580
I know I've been saying that I was gonna

696
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:55,200
do one since moving in here literally a

697
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:56,970
year and a half ago but I just honestly

698
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,710
I've never gotten time to it I'm always

699
00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:00,480
working I always have boxes and people

700
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:02,010
over every single day so it's placed a

701
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,600
little bit messy but I figured it was

702
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,320
finally time since I'm leaving it very

703
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,610
very soon

704
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,540
to kind of set everything up make it

705
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:08,250
look really really cute and show you

706
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:10,020
guys what I've been able to do with the

707
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,980
place over the past year I'm really

708
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,180
really happy with how it turned out and

709
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:13,710
I really hope you guys liked it as well

710
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:16,290
and got some inspiration and design at

711
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:17,640
tips I know that I'm so beyond blessed

712
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:19,380
to be living alone in the middle of Los

713
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,820
Angeles California and this huge

714
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:22,350
beautiful apartment I literally pinch

715
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:23,910
myself every single day because it feels

716
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:25,500
like I'm in a walking a magazine in this

717
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:26,940
life is a dream and I don't want this

718
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,710
thing off as bragging in any way shape

719
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:30,180
or form this would literally not be

720
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:31,770
possible if it was not for you guys so

saving my money for a very very long
