00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,720
hi sisters James Charles head welcome

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,310
back to my youtube channel I know this

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,080
whole vibe is a little bit different

4
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,550
than what you're normally used to it has

5
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,380
been a hot minute since I've had a hat

6
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,580
and glasses on on a youtube video but

7
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,259
for today's video actually have

8
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,549
something that I am really really really

9
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:16,710
excited about and that I've never done

10
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:18,750
on this channel before and that is a

11
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,189
drawing video in last night's video I

12
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,869
recreated a bunch my followers makeup

13
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:22,920
looks and literally thank you guys so

14
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:24,570
much for all the love and support on

15
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,029
that video if you have not yet seen it

16
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,289
click right up here it was so fun to do

17
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:30,449
but I was actually reading through all

18
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:31,920
of the positive comments and so many of

19
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:33,180
them were actually talking about how

20
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,559
amazing the looks were and how they

21
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,149
actually required a lot of artistic

22
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,410
ability and I was getting a lot of

23
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:39,390
questions at whether or not I was able

24
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:40,379
to draw I've talked to this a few times

25
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,360
in different YouTube videos but I've

26
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:44,340
never ever gone fully in depth and

27
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,329
before I ever was picking up a blending

28
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,190
brushes and beauty blenders and

29
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:49,140
eyeshadow palettes I was actually

30
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:51,120
drawing for the entire first half of my

31
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,949
life and I was not gonna lie pretty good

32
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,300
at it if I do say so myself my all-time

33
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:56,550
favorite medium to work with was

34
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,350
charcoal and with charcoal I really

35
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,789
loved drawing portraits I've always

36
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,859
obviously had a very huge interest in

37
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:03,449
human faces which clearly translated

38
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:05,430
into my love for makeup getting to do

39
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:06,780
art on my own face but I would always

40
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,640
creep or just a really really powerful

41
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,470
woman that I've looked up to I've done

42
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,880
cara delevingne at kendall jenner kylie

43
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,380
jenner but it's been at several several

44
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,400
years since I've actually done one today

45
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,930
so for today today I thought I would

46
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,659
just sit down and chill into a little

47
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,610
chitchat art with you guys I've never

48
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:22,200
done this before I'm super super excited

49
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,909
for today's portrait I really want to do

50
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,350
this picture of Demi Lovato that I

51
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:26,880
printed out you guys know I literally

52
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,439
love dummy she's one of my biggest role

53
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,759
models and she's also so beautiful so I

54
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:31,560
think she'll be really fun to create

55
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,270
today I have no makeup on this is just a

56
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,740
very very chill vibe so hopefully you

57
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,680
guys like this video and without further

58
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:40,829
ado let's get to a sister sketching

59
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,829
[Music]

60
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,220
okay so let's jump right into it this is

61
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:46,450
probably gonna take me a several several

62
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,830
hours I'm guess I'm just gonna be

63
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:49,300
switching between like this camera and

64
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:51,460
then this camera and like time-lapse

65
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:53,770
hello so let's just get started I have

66
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:55,660
my notepad here of charcoal paper and I

67
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:57,190
have a few different charcoal pencils of

68
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:59,680
different hardness I have these good and

69
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:01,810
fresh cysts or blending stumps and then

70
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,729
of course I have this reference image of

71
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:04,840
dummy that I printed out literally hello

72
00:02:03,729 --> 00:02:06,220
she looks the best ever in the entire

73
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,950
world so I'm going to try to recreate

74
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:10,149
this image today okay so I guess I'm

75
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:12,100
just gonna first start off by sketching

76
00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:13,870
some of the light outlines of her facial

77
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,940
features using the really really light

78
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:17,260
pencil I know a lot of people say don't

79
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,760
outline like it's against the rules of

80
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:20,739
artistry when literally hello how else

81
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:25,810
are you gonna know where to put your

82
00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:28,540
things so we're outlining today her face

83
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:30,040
probably goes to about here in the photo

84
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:34,200
and then her hair is covering it so I'm

85
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:38,730
just going to sketch in some hairs okay

86
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,730
her lips are probably gonna be about

87
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:44,190
here on this photo I'm pressing really

88
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:46,140
lightly my pencil as well because I

89
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:49,230
don't want to add too much color right

90
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:51,239
away since this paper is white I

91
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:52,830
obviously can't go any lighter with it

92
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:54,989
then white hello

93
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:56,069
color you can only go a darker so I'm

94
00:02:54,989 --> 00:02:57,810
being really careful as to where I

95
00:02:56,069 --> 00:02:59,370
actually put any pencil because it's

96
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:03,750
gonna be really hard to lighten things

97
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:06,510
later on a little bit also this top lip

98
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:11,250
here Leslie she's a pretty rounded

99
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:24,660
Cupid's bow actually um let's catch our

100
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:26,370
her sister schnoz Jeff Lee is a short

101
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:32,370
brown tail so probably right about there

102
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:34,620
I guess that's kind of all we need to

103
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:35,940
start sister shading a little bit so now

104
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,440
that we have two basic kind of layout of

105
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,730
all of dummies and facial features I

106
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,500
guess we get to go in and start shading

107
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:43,200
now and this is by far my favorite part

108
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,250
of the entire process I love love love

109
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,019
shading it's kind of just like

110
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,190
contouring of the face where you get to

111
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:48,660
really identity'

112
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:51,570
and highlights and shadows and just make

113
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,920
everything come to life so let's start

114
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:55,140
sister shading I want to avoid any

115
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,760
smudging as I possibly can so I guess

116
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:59,190
we're just gonna start right up here and

117
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:01,440
I'm just gonna grab my HB pencil from a

118
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:03,329
faber-castell and kind of lay down just

119
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,769
a really really light wash of color I'm

120
00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:06,359
going in super super light with this

121
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:09,000
because remember you can always layer on

122
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:11,340
it's very very very easy to add in any

123
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,750
shadows but it's extremely hard to bring

124
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,010
back any highlights but it's also

125
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,840
important to keep in mind nothing should

126
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:18,150
ever be white except for the highlights

127
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,200
in somebody's eyes or on the face and

128
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:20,729
like the lips then I'm just going to

129
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,350
take one of my up blending sums this

130
00:04:20,729 --> 00:04:25,080
one's kind of like a medium sized and

131
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:29,060
start to blend out that shading to

132
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,060
create smooth transitions

133
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:37,280
if anything ever becomes too harsh - I

134
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:38,600
really like to use these gummy erasers

135
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,370
you can get these at any art supply

136
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,620
store and you can kind of use this and

137
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:44,270
lightly kind of drag over the image to

138
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,920
pick up a little bit of that pigment I

139
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:47,540
really really love these racers for

140
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,160
doing this they work so much better than

141
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:50,540
normal pencil erasers would definitely

142
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,520
recommend I'm gonna go to the little bit

143
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:54,380
of a deeper pen so now this is a a 4b

144
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:57,590
which lays down color a lot harsher than

145
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:59,660
a normal to be white or than a normal HB

146
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:01,010
would I don't even know what these

147
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,690
pencils mean I'm not even gonna lie to

148
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:04,160
you guys I just know this one's deeper

149
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:05,630
so we're gonna use that one now I'm

150
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,100
gonna lay down this one right alongside

151
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:08,480
at dummy's hairline because obviously

152
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:10,070
we're gonna be drawing and hairs on

153
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:12,170
later on but there's definitely an

154
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:14,390
intense shadow going on in this region

155
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:15,740
and I need to add this to the picture

156
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:18,560
just gonna grab a blending stump and

157
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:19,790
blend that out so now that we have like

158
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,840
kind of the base the forehead it laid

159
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:22,880
out obviously we're going to come back

160
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,590
to this far later on but I want to keep

161
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,180
moving downward so I'm gonna grab a dark

162
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:28,010
pencil and I'm gonna start off doing it

163
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,600
Demi's eyebrows and I'm just gonna

164
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:30,710
basically do this by drawing in really

165
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,940
really light hair Ashok's

166
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:34,130
kind of in the same way that I would

167
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:35,510
normally do my own eyebrows in makeup I

168
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:37,730
definitely don't want to start off too

169
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:40,960
harsh and turn into Sharpie brows

170
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:40,960
because we all know what that looks like

171
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:49,520
I'm gonna go to the eraser like pinch it

172
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,140
and take this little dot kind of and use

173
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,400
this to go right in those brows and kind

174
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:54,320
of erase just some of those areas that

175
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,000
look a little bit more harsh to kind of

176
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,200
bring back some of the original paint

177
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,730
but underneath until it--and everything

178
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,990
up so it looks more natural

179
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:01,160
so now we get to start off by favorite

180
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:02,630
part of the entire portrait which is

181
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,190
always at the eyes I'm first gonna start

182
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:05,420
by shading the area that the eyes are in

183
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:07,460
so I'm just gonna grab my light pencil

184
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:09,380
once again and kind of shade this inner

185
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:11,540
corner I'm at dummies and nose Bridget

186
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:12,650
just to lay down a light base then same

187
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,930
thing I'm here I'm gonna lay some color

188
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:16,460
down right above the eyelid fold and we

189
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:17,900
have to create that kind of rounded

190
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,370
shape right up here with the brow bone

191
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,020
doesn't gonna follow the eye shadow

192
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:22,640
shape as well and bring some of this

193
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,440
color upwards just kind of like a

194
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:26,300
transition shade and makeup and then a

195
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,220
little bit below as well making sure to

196
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:30,200
leave open a white space which is where

197
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:31,700
the waterline will be later on I'm

198
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,950
actually so excited to be drawing Demi

199
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:35,810
today you guys know Heike how much of a

200
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:37,610
huge fan of her I am the rich is like

201
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:38,870
the only person to actually like Stan

202
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:40,730
even though I literally hate that word

203
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:43,070
she's just so talented it's not even

204
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:45,260
funny I want to do her makeup so bad

205
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:47,120
although Joe Pell glam does do a pretty

206
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:48,980
good job but like Demi needs a sister

207
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,510
James snatch she follows her on

208
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:52,190
Instagram we've dimmed back and forth a

209
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:55,940
few times about it I'm supposed to do it

210
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:57,770
all but she's I feel like my dream club

211
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:59,840
I just oh my god I feel like I could do

212
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:01,430
so many beautiful things with Demi who

213
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,710
about to me claiming her and then like

214
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:04,100
singing together actually that's a bad

215
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:06,169
idea

216
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:08,150
imagine me clamming her and then her

217
00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:10,610
singing to me and me not opening my

218
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:11,960
mouth and being silent much better

219
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:13,220
option okay so now I need to turn

220
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,750
eyelashes which I'm actually kind of

221
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,700
scared for because I do have a tendency

222
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:18,290
to definitely over draw eyelashes and

223
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:20,810
then they turn from like eyelashes into

224
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:22,700
like I fur and that's definitely not the

225
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:24,410
look we're going for today I definitely

226
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:26,990
wanna give her like on Miami lash as

227
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:28,550
opposed to like a fluffy lash if you

228
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:31,030
know what I mean so we're gonna be

229
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:31,030
really gentle

230
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:35,950
that's like four eyelashes okay at the

231
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:43,570
beauty guru and we needs to calm down a

232
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:44,800
little bit so this is gonna be a

233
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:45,820
scenario where I should have done the

234
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,980
left eye first

235
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:49,690
so my fault but I'm gonna grab a tissue

236
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:51,370
I'm gonna put this over the eye that I

237
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:52,660
just did so I can work on this eye

238
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:54,280
without rubbing the side of my hand

239
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:56,210
against the entire drawing let's do the

240
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:59,480
eyebrow first

241
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:59,480
[Music]

242
00:08:01,119 --> 00:08:04,699
okay so I need to start shading in

243
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:07,729
dummy's nose which I'm really not

244
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:10,039
looking forward to being that noses are

245
00:08:07,729 --> 00:08:12,860
by far the hardest part in my opinion in

246
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:14,180
any portrait because one wrong shading

247
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,409
moment and like literally the entire

248
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:17,689
nose is gone

249
00:08:15,409 --> 00:08:20,300
we gave Demi a rhinoplasty sorry sister

250
00:08:17,689 --> 00:08:22,369
so I'm gonna try at my absolute best to

251
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:24,409
follow the shading in this original

252
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:26,779
picture and cross my fingers and pray to

253
00:08:24,409 --> 00:08:30,580
the Lord and having a bob that we can do

254
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:32,479
this oh that was all supposed to happen

255
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,959
speaking of things that were not so so

256
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,659
happened

257
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:37,310
oh great segue James this weekend I just

258
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:39,079
went to Tanic on well didn't go to

259
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:40,370
tannic contactually went to the area of

260
00:08:39,079 --> 00:08:46,370
tannic on and then proceeded to not

261
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:48,490
attend tanyka and it was interesting to

262
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:50,300
say the least

263
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:52,760
that's all I want to say on that

264
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:59,480
probably can't wait for a hashtag sister

265
00:08:52,760 --> 00:09:00,769
cloud 2019 I want to take one of my tiny

266
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,480
blending sums now that already has some

267
00:09:00,769 --> 00:09:04,160
charcoal on it and I'm actually gonna

268
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,959
use this to create some of the freckle

269
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,959
that Demi has on her nose

270
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:22,370
okay this is like not bad team is Demi

271
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:25,140
[Music]

272
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:26,730
she doesn't have a slight butt chin as

273
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:28,440
well which can relate so I'm just gonna

274
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:29,670
sketch that in and make sure I leave

275
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,500
like a little bit of a shot a moment

276
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:33,600
there so I can kind of shape that in

277
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,370
place and it going up on this side of

278
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,770
the jaw she definitely has a much more

279
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:40,680
intense shadow so I'm gonna grab a much

280
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:41,910
darker pencil this one is 6b and keeping

281
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,280
in mind who's gonna be here here in a

282
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:46,290
little bit I'm just going to place in

283
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:54,330
some of that pencil to blend out in a

284
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:56,160
second okay so I'm gonna move on to the

285
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:57,330
lips now and lips have voiced assume

286
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,890
that I've kind of struggled a little bit

287
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:00,570
just being that similar to kind of like

288
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:02,130
I was saying in the forehead earlier you

289
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:03,840
have to really keep in mind the

290
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:06,150
lightness areas because it's hard to

291
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,380
bring it back once it's gone and when it

292
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:09,540
comes to the lips you have to make them

293
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,770
look wet looking which includes a lot of

294
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,480
highlight it looks like her makeup

295
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:14,520
artist use kind of like a gloss over the

296
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,890
entire lip area as opposed to kind of

297
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,820
over lining the actual liberation if

298
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:19,710
that makes sense do you guys know what

299
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:21,600
I'm talking about so I'm gonna try to

300
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:24,120
create this shadow over top of the

301
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,710
actual lip region I'm just using a light

302
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,780
pencil okay so I know that this lip

303
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:30,600
looks really really weird right now

304
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:32,580
trust me um hello I see it too but if we

305
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,710
actually compare it to the reference

306
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:36,660
photo as you can tell all of the kind of

307
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:38,280
dark shades and medium shades are there

308
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,780
all I really need to add back in is

309
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,670
going to be the highlight shades which I

310
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:43,590
have to add on with a pen later on so

311
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:45,560
I'm actually gonna leave this how it is

312
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:52,710
right now surprisingly

313
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:52,710
[Music]

314
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:57,910
well that actually didn't take as long

315
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,839
as I was expecting it's my talk that

316
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:01,480
I've been doing this for a little really

317
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:04,180
like six hours now so that's really fine

318
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,440
and brush but now we'll finish up I

319
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:13,690
guess the neck and the hair which should

320
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:15,370
be pretty easy so I'm just going through

321
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:17,050
my darkest pencil and I'm drawing in

322
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:20,050
hair strokes all around where the edge

323
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:22,570
of dummy's head is going to be I'm not

324
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:25,150
realizing that this entire outside area

325
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:27,070
is gonna be filled with black so instead

326
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:28,480
of wasting this charcoal pencil I spent

327
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:30,010
a lot of money on and sitting here

328
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,839
scrubbing the entirety of this canvas I

329
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:32,860
just found this can of a black paint

330
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,500
which I got when I moved into my

331
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:37,240
apartment hashtag not sponsored but I'm

332
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,279
gonna actually try to paint the entire

333
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:41,350
outside edge with block instead

334
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:42,940
hopefully this isn't the worst idea ever

335
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:43,810
I can't find my brake paint brush so I

336
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:46,120
guess I'm literally just gonna use a

337
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:48,550
morphe 57 brush to paint this entire

338
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:50,880
thing so usko genes for 10% of your

339
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,880
purchase

340
00:11:53,149 --> 00:11:59,459
I'm gonna grab some white paint also on

341
00:11:55,889 --> 00:12:07,860
a morphe this brush and draw in some

342
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:09,299
hair highlights okay you guys I'm so

343
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:15,660
nervous I don't know why what the heck

344
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:17,369
okay three two one okay on camera low

345
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:19,319
key looks pretty good in fresh their

346
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:21,389
sister dummy seven hours later I'm

347
00:12:19,319 --> 00:12:22,920
really really proud of the finish result

348
00:12:21,389 --> 00:12:24,269
let's be real it is definitely not

349
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,339
perfect it could look a little bit more

350
00:12:24,269 --> 00:12:27,569
like dummy I definitely wish I didn't do

351
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:29,069
the paint on the background I think it

352
00:12:27,569 --> 00:12:30,749
looked a little bit too dark and the

353
00:12:29,069 --> 00:12:31,769
white spots on the lips I don't know how

354
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:33,989
artists normally do that because

355
00:12:31,769 --> 00:12:35,939
whatever uh pens I was using we're not

356
00:12:33,989 --> 00:12:37,439
the tea but I feel like this is a solid

357
00:12:35,939 --> 00:12:39,029
like a nine out of ten and I'm just

358
00:12:37,439 --> 00:12:40,559
really really happy to be back in my

359
00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:42,629
roots and what really got me into art in

360
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:43,889
the first place being at portraits I had

361
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:45,119
so much fun drawing sister died when you

362
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:46,829
said it and I really really hope I did

363
00:12:45,119 --> 00:12:48,420
her justice she is by far one of my

364
00:12:46,829 --> 00:12:50,249
all-time at biggest role models I am so

365
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:51,420
he loved her I think she is by far one

366
00:12:50,249 --> 00:12:53,279
of the most talented vocalists of our

367
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:55,079
generation her vocals are truly

368
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,129
unmatched you can fight me on that in

369
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:58,139
the comments down below

370
00:12:56,129 --> 00:12:59,670
she is so unapologetically herself and

371
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:01,529
she's also just the most stunning person

372
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:02,759
ever so I really really want to do her

373
00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:04,319
