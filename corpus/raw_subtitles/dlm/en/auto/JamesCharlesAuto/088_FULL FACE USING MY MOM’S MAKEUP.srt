winner for the face chart and getting

9
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:17,970
halfway through the makeup book and then

10
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,890
finding out that the winning entry was

11
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,330

12
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,039

14
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,220

00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:48,800
we're gonna turn me into flashback Mary

129
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:51,800
it's okay so how long have you been

130
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:56,960
wearing makeup for um I started wearing

131
00:04:51,800 --> 00:05:03,680
makeup probably at the age of 14 so 51

132
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:04,700
minus 14 is quite a while 37 years Wow

133
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,990
Wow

134
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:08,420
from doing makeup when you were just a

135
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:10,160
young little sister to now how would you

136
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:11,900
say your makeup routine has changed well

137
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,240
it really hasn't changed that much until

138
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:16,460
just recently until you became a makeup

139
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,650
artist right then we started getting PR

140
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:21,080
packages in the mail on a daily basis

141
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:25,100
and I would snatch y'all know we bought

142
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:27,890
I borrowed some new products right I

143
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:29,750
just again started using brushes after

144
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:31,430
you left a bunch at home when you move

145
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:33,110
to besides that I always use my

146
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:35,240
applicators that you just threw in the

147
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:38,840
garbage which I'm a little sister sad

148
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:40,970
about thank you okay oh and eyebrows

149
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,950
I've never put on eyebrows before until

150
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:44,420
just recently that that's new for me too

151
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:46,490
and I'm that's my biggest struggle my

152
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:49,160
eyebrows because I cannot even with my

153
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:52,100
stencil I still can't get him even okay

154
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:54,400
so after the foundation I would use this

155
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:57,170
and this is brand new sue I never used

156
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,030
this is called what concealer concealer

157
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:02,450
I usually just put it right under my

158
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:05,090
eyes that's a yes that's more than I

159
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:06,960

horrible I agree oh all right the next

251
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:43,540
step is powder finally yes

252
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:45,760
great so either this one or this one

253
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:47,380
host would get some packages yep let's

254
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,770
use Miss Ready Set gorgeous you seem to

255
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,770
love her a lot

256
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:55,900
do you actually use this yes honey why

257
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:57,160
is it like crusted in here no you can

258
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:59,440
use your Beauty Blender to apply powder

259
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:01,860
no I didn't know that let's do that

260
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,860
instead

261
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:06,670
so now you're done with the pressed

262
00:11:04,269 --> 00:11:08,769
powder step you'll see yeah see now

263
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:10,720
everything looks nice and fresh I think

264
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:12,790
it all looks kind of one color beautiful

265
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:16,570
yeah yeah and then the next step would

266
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:19,149
be blush okay my third brush that I own

267
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:22,870
and then here's the blush I use Oh a

268
00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:30,009
blush okay once you about there that's

269
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:34,240
enough and then just oh my god this is

270
00:11:30,009 --> 00:11:36,310
so rough is it beautiful

271
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,589
and then I'm special occasions I'll use

272
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:42,370
this little highlighter the benefit

273
00:11:38,589 --> 00:11:42,699

with it

275
00:11:42,699 --> 00:11:52,180
mm-hmm this is why I don't use a benefit

276
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:53,740

277
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:55,360

278
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:59,019

311
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:29,260
some pencil marks in places that they

312
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:31,570
shouldn't be 60 cent plastic it was a

313
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:33,040
lot more than 60 cents but yes James

314
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:34,420
I've been getting a lot of compliments

315
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,550

00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:39,040

317
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:40,960
out of me and this is the reason why I'm

318
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:45,370
telling you James yes there it's not

319
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:49,930

323
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,130
wild ride but thank you mom for walking

324
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:58,990
me through your beauty routine and

325
00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:00,730
regardless of how copy these products

326
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:03,240
are used to look beautiful on a daily

327
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:06,940
basis so that's all that matters I guess

328
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:08,920
thank you I think every time I do these

329
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:11,650
videos people love to comment and say oh

330
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:13,120
my god James you're so ignorant so rude

331
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:16,210
not everybody used to put on as much

332
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,370
makeup as you do and I'm like no I do

333
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:18,940
know that but I do makeup now for a

334
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:20,560
living

335
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:22,030
and I didn't grow up wearing makeup so

336
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,400
that's why having to do that style of

337
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:26,860
makeup using your fingers and using old

338
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,360
products is always a shock factor to me

339
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:30,550
because it's not something that I'm used

340
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,320
to our styles are very different and the

341
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:35,530
amount of makeup that we use is very

342
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,570
different but I am excited to learn the

343
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:39,340
new techniques that you have taught me

344
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:42,070
