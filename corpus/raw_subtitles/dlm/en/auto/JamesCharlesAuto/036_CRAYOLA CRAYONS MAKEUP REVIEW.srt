00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,790
my sister's James Charles here and

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:04,259
welcome back it's my youtube channel

3
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:05,460
first today's the day we're doing that I

4
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:08,280
actually have not done in a very very

5
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,570
very long time and that is a review and

6
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,650
it fills you guys who have been watching

7
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,360
me for a while you know that I don't

8
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,280
really like doing reviews but mostly

9
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,240
because of one they're boring - I don't

10
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,160
release which up my beauty routine that

11
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,300
often and three the general public is

12
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,100
convinced that beauty gurus are

13
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,900
literally spawns of Satan and were sent

14
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,519
down to earth to literally fool

15
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,939
everybody and lied to them into buying

16
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,740
copy products a few days ago I was doing

17
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:29,970
some sisters shopping the play stylist

18
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,740
online to pick up some really cute

19
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,489
summer clothes and I was on ASOS which

20
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,170
if you don't know what that is

21
00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:35,700
it is a really really cute online

22
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,800
clothing retailer how I can not

23
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,300
sponsored by shag should be and I

24
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,309
actually came across the beauty section

25
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,260
on their website and found out something

26
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:43,710
that had me shook to the core and that

27
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,750
was that

28
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,489
Crayola the crayon company that we all

29
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:50,039
used to draw with when we were kids came

30
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:51,629
out with a full-on makeup line at first

31
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,610
sitting there I was very much sister

32
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:55,980
stumped on why the heck and our supplies

33
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:57,539
company would release a makeup line but

34
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,949
then I remembered it's kind of within

35
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:00,480
the same realm and you guys just saw me

36
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:02,039
do my full face using only art supplies

37
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,809
a few weeks ago and clearly the actual

38
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,869
products worked out pretty well so it

39
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:08,460
might not be that strange of a business

40
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:09,900
move for them but regardless I bought

41
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,119
the entire collection today I'm very

42
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,740
very very excited to see how these

43
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:15,270
products actually test out will they be

44
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,790
good or will they literally be like

45
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:19,530
crayons on my face we're gonna find out

46
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,660
so without further ado let's jump right

47
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,810
into the video

48
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,810
[Music]

49
00:01:24,259 --> 00:01:27,869
so lonely isotopes that need to search

50
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,570
up Crayola and it listed that they

51
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:32,220
launched 57 different items at the

52
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:34,259
collection which is actually like very

53
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,070
very large I definitely picked up a lot

54
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:37,200
of different things today that I'm

55
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:39,420
excited to try out and there are things

56
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,490
on this website ranging from brushes to

57
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:44,549
eyeshadow palettes to mascaras to

58
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:46,979
highlighters to face crayons which I'm

59
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:48,450
have no idea what that a is but I guess

60
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:49,920
we're going to find out so starting off

61
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,210
I picked up two different eyeshadow

62
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,439
palettes that they launched right off

63
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:54,479
the bat I'm gonna say packaging

64
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:57,090
absolutely beautiful this rainbow moment

65
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,490
is so so so cute and I got the nude

66
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:03,149
eyeshadow palette and the mermaid

67
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:05,130
eyeshadow palette France if you're

68
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:08,340
watching this please stop releasing

69
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:10,590
mermaid and unicorn themed items we are

70
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,380
all over it this has been a PSA the

71
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,210
palette sweet offer $29

72
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:17,690
and they come with ten shadows and each

73
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:19,280
kit meaning each shadow is $2.90 Wow I

74
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:20,840
love being at the queen of math and

75
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,430
they're actually both cruelty free and

76
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,960
vegan which is really really great I

77
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:25,730
also picked up the Crayola face palette

78
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:28,430
which once again retails for $29 and

79
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:30,380
contains a ten different OH

80
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:31,250
this is the face palette I really

81
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,630
thought this is gonna contain a

82
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:35,570
contouring color I've grabbed their

83
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:37,760
customizable lip palette which is $35

84
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:39,920
and once again contains ten at different

85
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,690
shades perfect for mixing I am very very

86
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,620
excited to try this out later on I don't

87
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:44,120
know if I knew you guys know this or if

88
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,920
ever tried it but anasazi beverly hills

89
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,720
actually has a really really great

90
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,400
formula for they're customizable lip

91
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,140
palette so I'm gonna be very interested

92
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,580
to see how this performs in comparison

93
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:54,680
to that one I grabbed the highlighter

94
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:57,290
cran and the shade shimmering blush and

95
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,900
this one was $17.50 which looks like

96
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:01,160
this interesting I'm a little bit scared

97
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:04,250
to put this over top of my foundation

98
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,930
but we're gonna make it work hopefully I

99
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:08,840
grab two different mascaras and black

100
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:10,370
and navy blue and these retail for $16

101
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,490
but the years of the collection for me

102
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:15,500
went a little bit sister so good lord I

103
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:17,750
picked up some of the Crayola face

104
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:20,180
crayons and I grabbed a yellow a block a

105
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:21,710
white a mango color a blue of red and a

106
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:24,890
nude color just a try out different eye

107
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:29,030
looks today now these look great on the

108
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:30,700
website they retail for $14.50 now to me

109
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:33,110
if this price hike seems a little bit

110
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:36,170
high beginner you're only getting point

111
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:38,180
zero seven ounces of product for $14.50

112
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:39,950
and I know for a fact that milk sells

113
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:42,290
their jumbo eye pencils for like six

114
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:44,480
dollars which is literally like the same

115
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:46,880
exact product hello I literally spent

116
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,500
101 dollars and fifty cents on all seven

117
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,300
of these eye pencils and what I find

118
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,709
even more ridiculous is that you can

119
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:54,709
literally go to the craft store and buy

120
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:56,450
a 96 packet of crayons which are

121
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:59,150
probably let's be honest the exact same

122
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:00,770
thing is this for nine dollars I got 96

123
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:03,740
crayons for nine dollars and I got seven

124
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:05,750
eye crayons for a hundred and $1.50

125
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:07,820
something does not add up here if you

126
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:09,200
ask me and finally my last purchase of

127
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:11,000
this collection is probably the worst of

128
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,830
all them being this Crayola Beauty make

129
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,090
up a brush set in case now when I saw

130
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:15,560
this breast I online originally I was

131
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:17,000
like wow it's so cute look at this brush

132
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:20,090
keys are you kidding me at holographic

133
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:24,110
Crayola Gorge and then I bought it for

134
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:27,110
$40 and I opened it up to fines

135
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:28,669
this for eyeshadow brushes for Quattro I

136
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,960
don't think so before we go ahead and

137
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:31,729
actually start my look today I thought

138
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,319
we should do some sister swatches of the

139
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:34,729
different eye crayons because these are

140
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:36,650
really what I'm most excited to see and

141
00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:38,810
how the heck of these perform so it's

142
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:40,520
awkwar-- that the shade white okay so

143
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:42,409
it's definitely a very very creamy

144
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,750
formula thank God it doesn't feel like

145
00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:46,819
an actual crayon on my arm we have the

146
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:48,319
shade dandelion so cute that these are

147
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:49,969
actually matching to the real names of

148
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:51,740
the Crayola pencils putting these on

149
00:04:49,969 --> 00:04:53,210
they actually feel kind of like oily to

150
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,189
apply I really thought that are gonna be

151
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:56,300
a lot more like hard I definitely am

152
00:04:55,189 --> 00:04:58,129
interested to see if these are going to

153
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,930
try it down because they definitely do

154
00:04:58,129 --> 00:05:01,669
it transfer as you can see it kind of

155
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:02,780
feels like you're playing a lip stick to

156
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:04,669
your arm whereas I felt like they were

157
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:06,710
gonna be a lot more dry next we have the

158
00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:08,539
shade at Mango Tango okay I guess this

159
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:09,469
one is a little bit sparkly that's kind

160
00:05:08,539 --> 00:05:11,060
of pretty i doesn't wanna try to use

161
00:05:09,469 --> 00:05:15,740
that one as a blush next we have the

162
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:17,629
shade of red oh wow that you're kidding

163
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:20,449
that was with literally zero pressure

164
00:05:17,629 --> 00:05:22,370
yeah these are a really sister soft this

165
00:05:20,449 --> 00:05:24,139
is like a lipstick wow that did not last

166
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:25,909
long this is a mess alright next I

167
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:27,349
picked up the shade and navy blue this

168
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:29,210
one also has a little bit of sparkle to

169
00:05:27,349 --> 00:05:30,680
it as well that's a really pretty color

170
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:32,210
not gonna lie I wanna use on the lower

171
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,430
lash line I also picked up the shade

172
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:35,659
desert sand which is like a little nudie

173
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:37,190
color I would caught this for out the

174
00:05:35,659 --> 00:05:38,779
waterline and this is really really

175
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:40,879
pretty and then finally of course I got

176
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:42,589
black but it's like the worst block that

177
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:44,240
I've ever swatch in my entire life what

178
00:05:42,589 --> 00:05:46,099
is that you think of all the colors the

179
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,659
block could be like the best one a tiny

180
00:05:46,099 --> 00:05:48,110
thing okay I'm a little bit sister

181
00:05:47,659 --> 00:05:49,669
spooked

182
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:50,930
after these swatches but you know what I

183
00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:52,729
want to see how this is gonna turn out

184
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:54,349
let's just jump right in I'm gonna first

185
00:05:52,729 --> 00:05:55,580
grab the face palette because I'm

186
00:05:54,349 --> 00:05:57,379
looking a little bit flat right now and

187
00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:00,050
I'm literally scared and I'm going to

188
00:05:57,379 --> 00:06:01,460
attempt to contour somehow I'm first

189
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:04,129
gonna grab the blush brush from this

190
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:06,199
collection and grab I think this shade

191
00:06:04,129 --> 00:06:07,699
or right over here and try to contour

192
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,719
this let's see luckily there's a mirror

193
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:12,650
in here which is actually really helpful

194
00:06:08,719 --> 00:06:14,000
it's not like bad it's just like not

195
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:15,020
there I was definitely right in the

196
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,400
beginning when I said that this palette

197
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:18,080
ee does not have any contouring option

198
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,190
which is hello it's a face palette I'm

199
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,419
gonna grab my Kat Von D shade and light

200
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:22,159
palette and just contour that I'm gonna

201
00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:23,900
go back to that in 30 seconds per blush

202
00:06:22,159 --> 00:06:25,159
and highlight and the full shebang okay

203
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,839
we're back with our regularly scheduled

204
00:06:25,159 --> 00:06:29,150
programming did you miss me you know you

205
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:30,349
did I'm gonna grab the blush brush once

206
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:33,020
again I'm gonna dip into this kind of

207
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:33,680
metallic e coral copper shade down here

208
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,270
it actually

209
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,460
very very stunning I want to try to use

210
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:39,919
this for at blush today so once again

211
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:41,449
it's not showing up can you see that

212
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,580
what's going on why is it not showing up

213
00:06:41,449 --> 00:06:45,500
with my face oh there it is okay it's

214
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:47,600
there she's there she came to the party

215
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,470
oh I love that okay

216
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,759
I feel like this blush shade is like

217
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:51,560
absolutely perfect for a really

218
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,270
beautiful bronze look for the summer

219
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,070
time to kind of transition your bronzer

220
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:56,960
to your highlight I really actually like

221
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:59,000
to shade a lot oh my god Wow okay cool

222
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,960
great love that you guys I like to do a

223
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,370
highlighter early on as well so I'm

224
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,780
gonna go back into the shade in a short

225
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:05,090
second I want to lay down this

226
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:06,800
highlighter stick at the base first this

227
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:09,680
is in the shade shimmering blush and

228
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,940
once again I think this was $17.50 these

229
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,889
kind of remind me of like the milk

230
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:18,050
sticks and that it's barely there come

231
00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:20,000
on Crayola this is like the texture of

232
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:22,039
what I thought the face crayons were

233
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,840
gonna be like like this has that waxy

234
00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:25,760
kind of more dry texture that I was

235
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,500
expecting and that does not look good

236
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:29,900
it's actually picking up the foundation

237
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:31,849
underneath which is definitely not good

238
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:34,759
do it does not look good that is

239
00:07:31,849 --> 00:07:35,900
canceled a million percent and said what

240
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:38,360
I'm gonna do is give my face a light

241
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:40,250
spray of six plus just like I always do

242
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,210
before I apply my highlighter and I'm

243
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,190
gonna go my morphe AB

244
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,870
501 brush and I'm gonna dip into this

245
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,919
shade right here in the face palette

246
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:47,330
which actually looks like a really

247
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:52,909
really pretty high later and let's try

248
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:54,949
out this instead okay not at that see

249
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:56,960
that looks good great love that the true

250
00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:59,090
test here is Kenneth snatch a sister

251
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,800
schnoz let's see that is the baseball

252
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:01,970
complete we are chiseled out we added a

253
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,500
little bit of color and now we are

254
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:05,360
glowing from with Ana I'm actually

255
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:07,340
really really loving how this is looking

256
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,750
so far but I'm gonna bake my faces set

257
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:10,130
it in place and I'll be right back a

258
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,909
little bit closer up to start off the

259
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:12,199
eyes okay

260
00:08:10,909 --> 00:08:15,470
literally about a sword in the eyeshadow

261
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:22,190
I am literally luck the pocket it's

262
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:24,650
literally flying apart oh you're kidding

263
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:25,880
okay this is just getting worse and

264
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:27,139
worse and worse for the second we're

265
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,030
gonna pretend like that shadow didn't

266
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:30,380
just fall out of the entire package good

267
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:32,930
lord I'm scared

268
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:34,640
okay let's freakin do this thing at this

269
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:36,020
point I'm gonna start off with the nude

270
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,089
eyeshadow palette which is literally

271
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:39,020
falling apart at its seams I think I

272
00:08:38,089 --> 00:08:40,370
really want to keep with the theme that

273
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,599
I have going on it's officially summer

274
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:43,159
time I know someone you guys are

275
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,810
graduating at congratulations by the way

276
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:45,470
so before I even jump into the eyeshadow

277
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:47,780
palette I actually

278
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:49,190
the yellow face cran and I think I want

279
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:51,470
to pop this in the inner corners like a

280
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:53,090
little fun a pop of color and see how it

281
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:54,920
actually it turns out it's actually

282
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,820
showing up on the skin surprisingly I

283
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,350
guess I'm just gonna grab like a

284
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:59,570
blending brush and see if I can buff

285
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:01,210
that out okay they do blend thank god oh

286
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:03,590
wait no they don't

287
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:05,180
okay so the cranes actually do blend out

288
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:06,590
but it definitely loses like almost all

289
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:09,290
of its pigmentation when you blend it

290
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:11,510
and it doesn't dry like it's still tacky

291
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:12,800
feeling this is not going well I'm gonna

292
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:14,300
put a little bit more on to bring some

293
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,830
of that color back similar to the

294
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,870
highlighter - it's actually taking off

295
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:19,970
the foundation from underneath the

296
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:22,520
crayon it still looks fine oh my god you

297
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:23,690
guys can't even oh wow hashtag for Cyril

298
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,070
problems when you buy two sets of a

299
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:26,150
camera and it still looks good so

300
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:28,520
looking at the newsprint looks like

301
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:30,050
there are four matte shades and then six

302
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,310
different shimmer shades which is a very

303
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:32,600
very bad ratio there should never be

304
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:34,280
more shimmer shades than matte sheets in

305
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,840
a palette I want to grab that red crayon

306
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:38,030
that literally melts it off when it was

307
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,260
touching my hand and see if one eye can

308
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:41,300
create an orange in the middle of this

309
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:44,750
eye look and also kind of wing this out

310
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:47,330
on oh my god why is this right doing

311
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:49,700
this let's grab the one eyeshadow brush

312
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:51,320
in the entire brush kit and try to blend

313
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:53,990
this out the sad thing is I'm like

314
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,700
actually really trying here like I don't

315
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:56,990
want to lawsuit from Crayola but I know

316
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:59,030
you can feel it coming okay that's not

317
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:00,740
that horrible what if I grab like a

318
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:04,310
regular morphe brush okay that's not

319
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:06,860
horrible it's like bad but like not the

320
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:08,450
worst me look at everything I'm like I

321
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:11,630
wonder if I grab a blending brush and

322
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:12,470
like a little bit of this oh okay that

323
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:13,550
actually works

324
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:14,480
okay what's actually really annoying is

325
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:16,130
that blending the red and the yellow

326
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,600
together like didn't make orange I

327
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:19,910
wonder if I put this mango shade in here

328
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,530
what that will do nothing it's gonna do

329
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:24,170
absolutely nothing apparently why can I

330
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:26,570
make orange like red plus yellow oh look

331
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:27,080
at me being an artiste oh we we welcome

332
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:28,520
to petit

333
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,990
maybe these are supposed to be like use

334
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,220
when you're like not wearing makeup

335
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:33,560
that's like that like it just over like

336
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:35,450
a eye thing or like you'd like just put

337
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:37,250
it on the cheek like as like a light on

338
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:39,200
the go type of thing this is just not

339
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:40,580
good I think is the conclusion that I'm

340
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,930
coming to here okay I want to figure how

341
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,250
to somehow finish this eye look and I

342
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:44,300
want to do a half cut crease so I can

343
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,830
turn out some of the shimmer shades in

344
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,880
here because they are so you look really

345
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:48,620
really stunning and I love the

346
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,330
highlighter in the face palette that we

347
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,800
used beforehand so I'm gonna grab my

348
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:53,090
shave tape concealer I'm gonna cut out

349
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,040
the crease but I'm actually really

350
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:56,980
nervous to do this being that these

351
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,780
shadows are

352
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:00,370
and are not drying down in the slightest

353
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:02,260
bit so this might all get mixed together

354
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:03,880
and we're gonna find out in a few short

355
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,320
seconds I'm gonna grab my morphe I'm 2

356
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,210
to 4 brush and start off with this kind

357
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:09,040
of light gold shade or right here at the

358
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:11,220
bottom and I'm gonna pack that on the

359
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,220
lid

360
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:20,380
hello what the heck what like this

361
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:22,930
swatch so nicely where is this on the

362
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:24,190
arm hello I do not see that do you I

363
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:25,090
feel like I need to treat you all the

364
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:26,740
way children right now because we're

365
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:28,420
doing a Crayola makeup tutorial what is

366
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:30,160
going on now that the crease is all kind

367
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:32,110
of cut I'm gonna grab this like a

368
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,060
metallic kind of ready orange shade

369
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:35,770
right here on a fluffy brush and I want

370
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:38,470
to use this to blend out the outer edge

371
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:41,050
into that red shadow that we have going

372
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:43,630
on I'm just gonna pop this right here oh

373
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:45,040
that's a good shadow okay not mad about

374
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:46,420
it I don't want to deep it up that outer

375
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,010
V a little bit too and add some more

376
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:50,110
dimension so I'm just gonna grab a Smith

377
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:52,870
235 brush and dip it this kind of like

378
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:54,010
muted grey tone up in this corner I'm

379
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:58,900
not sure how this is gonna turn out

380
00:11:54,010 --> 00:12:00,790
let's just try this it's only one of the

381
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:03,130
worst a looks I've ever done and I'm

382
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:04,780
literally not even being ironic yes I am

383
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:07,660
but I definitely use as much of the

384
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:10,240
colors as possible so we did get a black

385
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:12,280
crayon and I want to try to do a winged

386
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,860
liner with this which I know I'm going

387
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:18,880
to regret but you know what you don't

388
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:21,520
know unless you try why is this black so

389
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,260
sheer why would you ever want a block

390
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:25,030
that looks like this oh my god this is

391
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:26,860
also a cream so it's literally not gonna

392
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:28,060
dry down either that looks the worst

393
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:30,070
alright so that is the upper lash line

394
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:31,600
all complete and it looks not good but

395
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:32,830
let's move on to the lower lash line I

396
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,970
think I want to add a pop of color

397
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:36,670
because I really am dying to try out

398
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:38,290
this mermaid palette I first wanted one

399
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:39,970
of the crayon in the shade navy blue

400
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:42,010
first of all this is like a Sur lien

401
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:44,410
that kinda that we all loved not dark

402
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:46,540
blue I want to pop this right up here

403
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:47,050
for a fun pop of color and see how this

404
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,910
works

405
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:50,500
see that's actually really pretty like

406
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:52,090
that I can get behind

407
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,070
we love great and then I'm gonna go a

408
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:56,440
mix of these two shades right up and

409
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:58,000
here with my morphe m14 9 brush and use

410
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,850
that to epochal right over top to

411
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,380
actually set in the shade because cream

412
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:03,490
eyeshadow is whether or not Crayola

413
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:05,860
knows they are

414
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:07,000
supposed to be set with something with

415
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:08,470
that same brush I want to dip into this

416
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,839
darker purple shade it right up in here

417
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:12,220
and give Dada spreads a fix+ as well and

418
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:14,200
pack that on the outer corner because

419
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,339
purples are so pretty and I feel like

420
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,990
it's very very rare that you see like a

421
00:13:15,339 --> 00:13:18,850
metallic purple and an eyeshadow palette

422
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:20,020
so I really want to test this out okay

423
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:21,370
you know what as much as I was making

424
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:23,080
fun of it there I mean I showed up how a

425
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:24,790
hundred percent outperform the nude

426
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,350
palette this actually is really pretty

427
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:27,730
I just can't get over the fact that this

428
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:28,900
black eyeliner is literally like not

429
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:30,370
block who does that

430
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,960
how would you ever do that okay so I got

431
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:33,760
this nude shade desert sand to pop in

432
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:41,950
the lash line so we're gonna pop it in

433
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:44,200
the lash line I feel like that did like

434
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:50,020
very I guess it kind of worked okay

435
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:52,510
should I tree white instead oh okay

436
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:54,370
that's actually a bomb white liner kind

437
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:57,040
of all right that is enough of the

438
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:58,330
eyeshadows I thought mascaras these were

439
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,190
16 dollars each I'm gonna start off with

440
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:02,200
the black one on the upper lashes and

441
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:03,190
see how this mascara actually it

442
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,620
performs

443
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:06,670
I like this wand a lot actually Wow as

444
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:08,260
they filming this video literally could

445
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:10,950
not get any worse I am out of lash glue

446
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:12,940
a gray bar 20 minutes later alright

447
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:15,400
finally huh

448
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:17,110
that is one I look all complete looking

449
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,250
in the mirror I actually don't hate how

450
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:19,540
this turned out I feel like we had a

451
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:21,220
mission to go on and although we may

452
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:22,360
have failed I like the direction that

453
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,100
this is going in and I really want to

454
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,720
recreate this look sometime soon with

455
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:27,160
like really good at working a product

456
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,750
that being said this eyelid literally

457
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,250
took me 45 minutes to do and I still

458
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,810
don't feel like it's up to par the

459
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:33,430
blending is not great these cream

460
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:35,350
shadows still are not dry down which is

461
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:36,670
very very strange and it's just not as

462
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:38,440
vibrant and pigmented as I was like them

463
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:39,730
to be that being said I'm gonna go and

464
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,810
do the other eye off-camera really

465
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:42,279
quickly and hopefully try to do it a

466
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:43,839
little bit faster and I'll be right back

467
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:46,150
to finish off the rest of this Crayola

468
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,160
all right hello i am back and those are

469
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:49,810
both eyes Oh complete thank God I'm

470
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,640
gonna finish up my look today with a lip

471
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:53,830
so let's go ahead and grab the custom

472
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:55,839
lip palette I think I want to do

473
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:57,459
probably just like a nude lip I did a

474
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,110
rainbow I look so I think I need to like

475
00:14:57,459 --> 00:15:00,339
balance out a little bit something you

476
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:01,990
thought I want to mix in this shade

477
00:15:00,339 --> 00:15:04,330
together right here with a pink to make

478
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:05,890
a slightly lighter nude let's see how

479
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:07,690
this actually works under go this mom

480
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:08,950
shape eye down here mix it on my arm I

481
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:10,020
guess and then a little bit of this

482
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:12,149
white shade

483
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:14,040
well okay they don't leer really creamy

484
00:15:12,149 --> 00:15:15,779
that's for sure which is great I want to

485
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,130
add a slight bit of yellow as well and

486
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:20,100
make it a little bit more peachy tone

487
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:21,810
let's try this what the heck that is not

488
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:29,190
what I wanted okay it kind of tastes

489
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:31,380
like like not good

490
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:33,720
ugly lip color ever for this look I'll

491
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:35,610
take a bright Barbie baby pink like no

492
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:38,310
that is not what I wanted I wanted like

493
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:46,440
a dark nude how do I make that maybe

494
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:48,510
like shad Brown I would love to tell you

495
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:51,600
how I got to this color but I don't even

496
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:53,100
know myself all right guys I'm calling

497
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,779
it quits for this video today this

498
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,610
review has been something else

499
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:58,380
Crayola sweetie love you the most you

500
00:15:56,610 --> 00:16:00,570
made a childhood pretty iconic but I

501
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:04,020
think we need to stick to our 96 crayons

502
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:04,589
for ten dollars because all this is not

503
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,670
working out

504
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:08,310
overall this collection is not

505
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:09,540
absolutely the worst but I definitely

506
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:11,310
not recommend you guys to go and run and

507
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,870
find your money on it these face cramps

508
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:14,279
I would have to say by far the worst

509
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:15,570
thing in this entire collection they are

510
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:17,040
way too waxy it they're not that

511
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:19,020
pigmented and they do not blend out very

512
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,120
well they don't dry down and they're way

513
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:22,320
way a way to overprice the next demo eye

514
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,940
pencils are a much better alternative

515
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,920
the eye shadow palettes however we're

516
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:27,240
actually not that bad specifically the

517
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,500
face one I actually really really like

518
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,880
this one this highlighter shade right

519
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,740
here looked absolutely stunning on the

520
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,120
cheeks and this metallic coral blush I

521
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,529
am literally in love with I want to

522
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,120
reach for this all the time this summer

523
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:36,990
and the mermaid palette as such as I was

524
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,430
actually making fun of it in the

525
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:39,630
beginning was actually a pretty bomb as

526
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,320
well and I love how it looks on the

527
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:41,700
lower lash line

528
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,079
the lip palette although I was having a

529
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,790
really hard time finding a decent shade

530
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:46,290
at first I think I was actually able to

531
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:48,779
mix together a really beautiful nude and

532
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:50,250
the formula feels really really really

533
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:51,990
nice but I would definitely recommend

534
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:53,040
buying a lipstick instead because I know

535
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:54,029
most you guys don't want to sit there I

536
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,250
was thinking wording and mixed together

537
00:16:54,029 --> 00:16:57,810
a lipstick I know I certainly don't the

538
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:59,100
mascaras were okay they definitely like

539
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:00,240
did their job of coating and lash and

540
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,020
giving them a little bit of a lift but

541
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,190
they're definitely not something that I

542
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,750
would recommend or say that you needed

543
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:06,150
in your life and the brush collection is

544
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:08,189
an absolute now please never spend $40

545
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,510
on four brushes ever I actually really

546
00:17:08,189 --> 00:17:10,949
really do love the look that I came up

547
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:12,420
with today but it just took me way too

548
00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:13,829
much time way too much ever and way too

549
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,400
much packing and Blandings we ought to

550
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:15,990
really get

551
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,339
good eyelet going on I'm actually really

552
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:18,120
disappointed because you guys so I say

553
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:20,100
all the time

554
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:22,080
I wrote a big Oprah R and you guys might

555
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:23,339
grew up drawing painting and coloring

556
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,690
and Crayola actually did have a huge

557
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:25,860
huge part in my life and it got me

558
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:27,450
through a lot of really really tough

559
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:28,620
times as a kid but it really sucks to

560
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:29,670
say that I will not be recommending this

561
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,840
collection to you guys and it will

562
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:32,670
definitely not be a part of my future

563
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,930
