10
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,279

23
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,110

left and right so many makeup videos so

27
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:52,860

28
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,750
what we have yet to do is a Q&A so I

29
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,039
'post on Instagram asked you guys for a

30
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,809
bunch of questions and now we're going

37
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:11,670

38
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:14,939

filter this one

43
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:23,070
Alicia asked is it really hard managing

44
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:25,049
a career and school while they're in two

45
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:26,700
separate places it definitely could be a

46
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:27,000
lot easier but it also could be a lot

47
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,619
harder

48
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,150
luckily my administrators and teachers

49
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:31,500
are all like super on board with

50
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,150
everything that I'm doing so they're

51
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,880
helping me kind of make it through

52
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:37,409
without having like emotional trauma

53
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,150
Tiffany asks what's your favorite thing

54
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:41,100
about your life now and how has becoming

55
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:42,509
basically famous affected you probably

56
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,710
the coolest thing about like everything

57
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:45,479
that has happened to me recently has

58
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:47,520
been getting to meet all of you guys in

59
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:48,570
like public places like Laos out to

60
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,430
dinner last night with friends and like

61
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:51,869
15 people like came up to me was like

62
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,280
you take the pictures I was like oh wow

63
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:54,930
I just want to enjoy my orange chicken

64
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,909
in peace but it was definitely like

65
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,140
really really cool to be able to like

66
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:59,850
see you guys and see everybody who's

67
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,689
supporting me so that's probably my

68
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,100
favorite thing about it

69
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:03,810
oh imagine my phone dying in the middle

70
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:07,020
of an Q&A oh it actually just died as I

71
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:08,399
said that that's fake Sam asked how long

72
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,560
does it take to create a simple look or

73
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,350
even one of your special ones well it

74
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,120
definitely depends like I threw this to

75
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:15,500
and probably like an hour but my like

76
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,540
more intricate ones can definitely take

77
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,550
up to like seven hours of my longest one

78
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,380
for Halloween this past year so I could

79
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:23,480
definitely be a little bit of a lengthy

80
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:25,100
process to say the least but if like

81
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,300
obviously what I love to do so I'll just

82
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,220
sit down hang out with friends

83
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,840
FaceTime people listen to music just to

84
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:32,570
like keep the time going but usually

85
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,280
it's like oh good time

86
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:36,320
clearly it's a good time or else I would

87
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,510
not be studying seven hours do Esther

88
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:43,310
says will you sing me a song you lovely

89
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:45,920
man oh no Maria asked James tell us

90
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:47,750
top or bottom well Maria when it comes

91
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,010
to my eyelashes my top lashes are

92
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:52,030
already pretty long so I would

93
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:54,380
definitely say that I prefer the bottom

94
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:56,090
and your ass how do you say happy and

95
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,980
confident in this world of haters love

96
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:59,480
you James Oh Andrew I love you as well

97
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:01,280
that's a great question that I get asked

98
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,660
all the time I really try hard to not

99
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,490
let hate bother me and I know that's

100
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:06,470
like not the best way to just be like oh

101
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:08,180
yeah don't let it get to you because a

102
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:10,040
lot of people can't really do that but

103
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,940
for me it's just like everybody has a

104
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,290
right to their opinion and that's

105
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:14,720
totally okay if you don't like me I

106
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:16,040
don't care also now that Instagram has

107
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,560
like hate comment filtering I have a

108
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,480
bunch of like target nasty words filter

109
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,280
it out so it's you can't comment them so

110
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,280
at this point if you do a hate comment

111
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,450
on my photos I'm like slow clap for you

112
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,520
because you really put in a lot of

113
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:31,340
effort so you must be really really mad

114
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:33,950
and it's a great thing to be opinionated

115
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:35,420
these days arrow asked what you hear a

116
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:36,860
flavor of ramen pork

117
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:42,050
people always say chicken I like the

118
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:44,360
program in JJ's ASMR channel coming in

119
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:45,800
2017 Christina asked how do you get your

120
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,270
teeth so white okay so this is actually

121
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,650
a question I get all the time it's

122
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:50,450
actually when I post my only pictures on

123
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:52,130
Instagram that I promise it's not the

124
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:53,570
face tune wait until I worked very very

125
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:55,460
hard for these babies right here I had

126
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:57,350
braces for a long period of time and I'm

127
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:59,210
not gonna let them get ugly and crusty

128
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:00,710
and old now I've been using a teeth

129
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:02,930
whitening kit from Smile Sciences now

130
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:03,920
for a few weeks I have not talked about

131
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:05,180
it yet because I really want to make

132
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,800
sure that it actually worked before I

133
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,970
went and promoted anything because you

134
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,800
guys know that I never want to promote

135
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:11,600
like a crappy product and I definitely

136
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,790
was extremely skeptical before in trying

137
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,680
this but I am very excited to say that

138
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:18,109
actually like really does actually work

139
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,750
my teeth look very good as you can see

140
00:04:18,109 --> 00:04:22,010
hello right here there's meat it comes

141
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,340
with two little trays and like teeth

142
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:24,570
whitening gel and then

143
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:26,880
the classic blue lights that you just

144
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:28,230
and you let it sit and then you take it

145
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,590
off and bam your teeth are a whole lot

146
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:31,500
lighter

147
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:32,430
it is cruelty-free vegan USA made and

148
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,520
even though you're shopping a thing into

149
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:37,350
your mouth doesn't hurt no good catch

150
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,880
like I said I was extremely skeptical at

151
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:40,800
first but after trying it really does

152
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,600
work so it's like a great product of

153
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,040
