00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,540
hi sisters James Charles here and

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:05,040
welcome back to my youtube channel so

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,930
you may be wondering why my hair is not

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,480
styled and pooped up like normal and why

5
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:11,550
I'm wearing this very fancy wake up up

6
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,950
on my head today and for today's video

7
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,059
we're gonna doing a drag tutorial I've

8
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,289
only done drag a few times on my

9
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:17,609
Instagram page but they've all been

10
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:19,350
looks at I've been super super proud of

11
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:20,640
and every time I do post one as well

12
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,750
literally all the comments are what are

13
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,070
you doing a video when are you filming a

14
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,199
video we want to know how to do this so

15
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,820
for today's video I sat down and I'm

16
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,699
gonna teach you guys how to go from this

17
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,140
to this I have a ton of products here in

18
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:32,369
front of me and ironically enough most

19
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,230
of them are actually part of my everyday

20
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:35,940
makeup routine dry makeup doesn't have

21
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,170
to be some crazy expensive art you can

22
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,790
totally use the products you have at

23
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,860
home just in a different style that you

24
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,300
might not think of obviously I am NOT a

25
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,829
dry queen you guys know I am a makeup

26
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,020
artist and I definitely cannot perform

27
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:48,420
or dance on stage that is for [ __ ] sure

28
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,550
but 50% of drag is the whole aesthetic

29
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,320
behind edit is a very very cool and

30
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,640
beautiful art form so without further

31
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,530
ado if you would like to see it Mia

32
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,940
transform into a drag queen and just

33
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:02,969
test out some driving makeup today make

34
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:04,470
sure you keep on watching alright so

35
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:06,090
some drag queens have their eyebrows

36
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,860
shaven up but of course I have a very

37
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:09,360
very bushy brows so our first step today

38
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,860
is going to be to cover them up all

39
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,320
you're gonna use the classic Elmer's

40
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,330
glue stick a spoolie and then a wet

41
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,680
towel I'm basically just taking my glue

42
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:18,900
stick and running this all throughout my

43
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,090
eyebrows and I'm going super hard as

44
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,070
well I want a ton of glue to get on

45
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,150
there especially for the first layer I'm

46
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:26,040
gonna grab my spoolie brush and I'm

47
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:29,400
gonna pull my skin up and I'm just going

48
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:31,640
to really really roughly go through that

49
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,750
brow and brush all the hairs upwards

50
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,310
it's really importantly you do a good

51
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,960
job spooling through these and brushing

52
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,520
them all the way upwards flat to your

53
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,020
face because once you add a lot of

54
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,430
layers of glue you will be able to a

55
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,810
powder and foundation right over them

56
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:44,189
and hopefully the goal this will

57
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,750
obviously be that there is no texture

58
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:46,799
and you can't see them at all so you

59
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,390
really have to make sure that the brow

60
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,430
covering process is done it's super

61
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:51,869
super efficiently and then once it's all

62
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,610
comb through I just wet the corner of

63
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:56,460
this towel and then I always like to go

64
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:58,710
around the hairs and just kind of wipe

65
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:00,630
away the extra of glue

66
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,890
having the least amount of glue possible

67
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,240
the better but obviously you need to

68
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,920
cover them depending on how thick your

69
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,689
bronzer and mine are super super thick

70
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,190
so I always like to wipe away the glue

71
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:09,690
around the edges so therefore the glue

72
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:11,310
it's only on the brow and not on the

73
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,050
skin it because that creates unwanted

74
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,500
texture it later on so by the time that

75
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,570
this eyebrow

76
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,920
flew down and cleaned up this bra is now

77
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:19,020
completely dry so we can go on to the

78
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,100
next layer so for this layer once again

79
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,630
I'm gonna grab my glue stick and I'm

80
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,460
just gonna press really really hard on

81
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,990
to the actual hairs and I'm gonna make

82
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:27,150
sure to really kind of dig this into my

83
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:28,770
forehead as well because once we put the

84
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:30,030
glue on this layer we are gonna spoolie

85
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:32,370
through it because that's just going to

86
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:34,020
interrupt the layer beforehand so from

87
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:35,850
now on we're just going to layer over

88
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,800
top and then clean it up and we're gonna

89
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:39,720
repeat this exact process probably three

90
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,310
or four times until we have four layers

91
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,390
of glue total and then we'll go on to

92
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:44,190
the next step

93
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:46,560
all right so this is four layers of glue

94
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:47,850
completely packed on there and dry and

95
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,739
the next step is gonna be to go in with

96
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:52,020
Cody err some powder and a powder puff

97
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:52,950
and pack those brows down I'm gonna take

98
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,500
their powder puffs and I'm gonna dip

99
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:57,260
into quite a lot of powder just dust the

100
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,430
excess off

101
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,870
coughing it because we all know what

102
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:04,170
this smells like and then I'm going to

103
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:05,040
pack it into my brows I'm definitely not

104
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:07,050
going to be worrying about fallout

105
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,030
because we can always brush it away but

106
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:10,920
basically this powder is going to really

107
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:13,590
set the brows in place make sure that

108
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,690
that glue is 100% set and then also fill

109
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:17,850
in any areas that texture is still left

110
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:22,920
which makes them super super smooth and

111
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:24,090
ready to cover with foundation for

112
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,410
foundation today I'm going to be using

113
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,519
my new favorite crumble that I've been

114
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:28,080
telling you guys about and that is the

115
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:29,310
Make Up For Ever Ultra HD and the Too

116
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,830
Faced Born This Day Foundation

117
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:33,690
I am in the shade @y at 325 in this one

118
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:35,220
and then natural beige and the two-faced

119
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:36,690
one I'm just gonna go in and I'm going

120
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,280
to go over the brows first and I'm just

121
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:40,350
going to press that foundation in there

122
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,390
pretty hard to really fill in all the

123
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:45,690
places and you see how that brow is now

124
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:46,890
completely covered and that's spooky I'm

125
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:48,269
actually gonna let this Foundation start

126
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:49,860
to set in place and dry down just a

127
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:51,390
little bit before I go into my full face

128
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,340
and while I do that I'm gonna go to the

129
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:55,049
makeup forever Pro sculpting palette and

130
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,459
I'm going to color cracks just gonna

131
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:58,380
grab any normal packing brush and go

132
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:00,269
into this orange shade and then rub it

133
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:02,400
all over my beard area I definitely get

134
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:03,420
a pretty bad 5 o'clock shadow now that

135
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,739
I'm thinking about it I probably should

136
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,480
have color corrected my eyebrows to

137
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:08,970
being that they are a blue toned hair

138
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,320
just like all hair and body is so I was

139
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:12,239
pretty done with me but I guess we're

140
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,220
just going to color correct the beard

141
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,989
and pray that the eyebrows get decent

142
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,310
coverage basically I want to put this

143
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:19,320
consider anywhere where I normally have

144
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:20,910
darkness or a body hair growing I

145
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,300
definitely get a lot of hair on my chin

146
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:23,500
massage area and then in my

147
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,210
sideburns and then I definitely get a

148
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,069
lot of darkness underneath my eyes from

149
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:28,539
barely sleeping from editing all night

150
00:04:27,069 --> 00:04:29,770
long but basically the orange tones that

151
00:04:28,539 --> 00:04:31,360
the concealer are going to cancel out

152
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:33,310
the blue tones of the darkness which

153
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,360
just furthers the illusion let's I can

154
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,319
see those all in there and blend it out

155
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,669
I'm just gonna go end up my makeup

156
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:40,479
forever stick once again and just cover

157
00:04:36,669 --> 00:04:42,490
it over my entire face I'm definitely

158
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,720
putting a lot of this on and going full

159
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:48,030
coverage tonight this is definitely not

160
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:49,870
a natural everyday look by any means

161
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:52,569
this is literally the most horrifying

162
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:54,250
look ever max I'm gonna go to light our

163
00:04:52,569 --> 00:04:56,199
shave tape in the shade light and just

164
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:57,879
highlight my face like I said we are not

165
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:00,190
going for a natural look in any means

166
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:05,259
for today so I'm definitely packing a

167
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:07,000
lot of product on I know a lot of drag

168
00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:08,919
queens like doing a cream contouring 1/4

169
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,150
or makeup for me cream contouring is

170
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:11,590
just something that I'm not really a fan

171
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:13,389
of so I am gonna be doing all powder

172
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,440
contouring today but that is totally up

173
00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:16,150
to personal preference you can do

174
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,409
whatever you want if you wanted to do

175
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,639
cream contouring and now would be the

176
00:05:17,409 --> 00:05:20,530
time to do it before we get into powder

177
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,789
and the next step and then once again

178
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:23,020
I'm gonna grab my coat here some powder

179
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:24,729
and a powder puff and we're going to

180
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:27,009
pack the powder on today

181
00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:28,150
flashback Mary here we come I'm gonna

182
00:05:27,009 --> 00:05:29,349
start by setting underneath my eyes

183
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,880
because that's we're gonna get the most

184
00:05:29,349 --> 00:05:32,259
amount of creases and then I'm gonna

185
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,580
really pack the powder into my nose

186
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:34,330
because you're gonna be contouring it a

187
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,889
lot today

188
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:37,449
and I really want to make sure that the

189
00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:39,460
foundation and concealer stay on there

190
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:41,110
and don't wear off same thing when it

191
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,580
comes to the eyebrows I'm just gonna be

192
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,690
really really gentle as well because we

193
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,969
don't want to take off any of that

194
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:51,430
product that we already layer down are

195
00:05:45,969 --> 00:05:52,690
also gonna start peeking back through to

196
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:54,610
contour my face today I'm gonna use

197
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:56,710
shocking my Kat Von D shade and light

198
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:58,150
palette I'm gonna use my Brophy M 405

199
00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:00,370
brush and dip into the left and middle

200
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:02,529
shade and I'm just gonna go in and test

201
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:04,750
out my face I usually cover from about

202
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:06,759
here down to the corner of my mouth but

203
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:08,800
for actual drag makeup I'm gonna contour

204
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:10,389
starting at the top of my sideburn and

205
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,389
then I'm gonna go and draw a like more

206
00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:15,069
curved line kind of ending more up here

207
00:06:13,389 --> 00:06:16,569
instead that just gonna really raise my

208
00:06:15,069 --> 00:06:19,150
cheekbones and give them more of a

209
00:06:16,569 --> 00:06:20,440
feminine appearance obviously there's no

210
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:21,699
exact way we're gonna do drag you can

211
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,020
put your face however you want you can

212
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:25,330
contour however you want and I know

213
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:27,009
there's no exact male or female face

214
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,210
shape that we need to follow I'm just

215
00:06:27,009 --> 00:06:30,190
doing it based on these standards that

216
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:31,599
people usually do follow when it comes

217
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,889
to contouring the jaw line similar to

218
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,880
the cheek bone I am gonna do something a

219
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:34,860
little bit different to make everything

220
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,720
look more saw

221
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:38,550
I'm actually going to chisel up my

222
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,800
jawline starting at the corner here and

223
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:42,180
kind of rounding this out a little bit

224
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,880
just to get my face some more stock and

225
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,930
once again feminine appearance when it

226
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,910
comes to my notes to contour it you

227
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:49,920
sisters already know that I love a good

228
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:51,540
chiseled out pinched ass

229
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,800
nose so for today's like I'm just gonna

230
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:55,670
do the same exact thing just a little

231
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,670
bit more intense

232
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:10,860
finally to finish off the base I'm just

233
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:12,990
gonna go in with my benefit hoola

234
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:14,280
bronzer in my Murphy M five to seven

235
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:16,080
brush and I'm just gonna use this

236
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,160
bronzer to kind of blend together the

237
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,630
contour and highlight and make

238
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,790
everything at nice and bronzy and

239
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:22,470
connected same exact thing outcode

240
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:24,360
here's a powder eye powder puff one last

241
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:25,710
time you guys know that I stopped baking

242
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,360
my face and my normal makeup routine a

243
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:28,860
very very long time ago when I moved to

244
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,330
California I just thought that it wasn't

245
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,010
really necessary anymore and I much

246
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:33,720
preferred the more glowy dewy foundation

247
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:35,310
look but when it comes to drag makeup

248
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,080
baking is absolutely necessary

249
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:38,490
it definitely locks the face in place

250
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,590
because these Queens that are doing this

251
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:42,180
makeup on a nightly basis are gonna be

252
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:44,340
performing on stage under a whole lot of

253
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:45,450
lights and dancing and sweating so it

254
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,640
really makes sure all the foundation

255
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:49,170
stays on and also using the translucent

256
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,580
powder intensifies all the highlights

257
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:52,020
that we use with our concealer earlier

258
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,340
which just makes the makeup have a lot

259
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:55,670
more dimension and just look better in

260
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,670
in general

261
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:01,710
alright so brace yourself because Drive

262
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,540
brows are by far the most complicated

263
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:05,040
part of drag makeup and even after doing

264
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:06,420
look several several times and being a

265
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,920
professional makeup artist it is still

266
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,480
so hard for me to keep my brows perfect

267
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,070
and symmetrical but we're going to try

268
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,720
of course so today I'm gonna be using

269
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:14,190
the benefit curb brow and I'm using the

270
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,540
shade and number three to match my wig

271
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:16,560
and then I'm just gonna use any old

272
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:18,960
anchor brush and this is the makeup

273
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,980
shock t-55 okay so I just grabbed a

274
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,210
little bit of product on my angle brush

275
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:23,400
and I'm just gonna start sketching them

276
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:26,310
and so I'm basically gonna start my brow

277
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:28,440
at the bottom of my normal brow I want

278
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:30,300
my new Brown to be in the exact same

279
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,010
starting position as my old one so

280
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,419
therefore they look natural and I'm just

281
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:36,660
gonna draw them a whole lot more arched

282
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:39,440
than my normal everyday brows and a

283
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:39,440
little bit thinner too

284
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:53,000
once they have the bottom line of the

285
00:08:51,260 --> 00:09:00,230
brow all lined up I like to Donna start

286
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:01,760
at the outside and make the tail then I

287
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:03,320
always like to draw that upper brow and

288
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,900
right about here and then just connect

289
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,280
him well if they have those brows all

290
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,690
lined in and pretty much filled up I

291
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,490
like to take just the side of the brush

292
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:15,320
and go in and start to pack that product

293
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:16,730
forward to create a natural ombre once

294
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,500
their ombre now I'm gonna go back to the

295
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:20,240
very original angle brush being the t-55

296
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,920
from makeup shock and dip it to this

297
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,840
dark brown shading it right up in here

298
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,070
and just create some brown strokes as

299
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,270
always with my normal brows I'm gonna

300
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:28,100
grab a little bit more shaped tube

301
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:30,650
concealer once again in the shade light

302
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:40,730
and then at my morphe 43 brush and just

303
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:42,260
clean them up with any excess consider

304
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:46,210
I'm just going to prime and set my

305
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:46,210
eyelids and get ready for eye shadow

306
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:51,890
okay so now that the brows are all

307
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,630
complete you can take a major deep

308
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:55,430
breath because the rest is all smooth

309
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:56,630
sailing from here so fresh titled like I

310
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,740
said I'll be using the Jacqueline Hale

311
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:59,720
pill and I'm gonna start off using my

312
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:01,730
makeup shock t4 brush and dipping into

313
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,290
this neutral tone a brown shade right up

314
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:05,810
in here and just lightly dusting that in

315
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:07,100
my crease I'm gonna be cutting out my

316
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:13,010
crease today so I'm gonna be putting

317
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:13,970
this just slightly above if you guys

318
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:15,080
have followed me for a while you've

319
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:16,370
probably seen all the job looks that

320
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,990
I've done there really hasn't been that

321
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:19,880
many of them in the first place

322
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:21,650
but I used to do a really really really

323
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,360
intense style outdrive makeup that

324
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:25,040
really was never flattering to my face

325
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,180
everyone would always tweet them when I

326
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,630
[ __ ] posted them saying I look like

327
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:31,370
the dragon from Shrek which yes I'll

328
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:33,140
give you that they're definitely dead I

329
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:35,060
recently just discovered a Brazilian

330
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:37,670
drag queen ever named Pablo avatar that

331
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:39,350
I am literally obsessed with he's so

332
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:41,900
pretty he's also a musician so like a

333
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:43,610
true freaking sister because makeup is

334
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:45,470
very very natural and not very intense

335
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:47,030
even for being a drag queen so as soon

336
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:48,350
as I saw him I was so inspired to test

337
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:49,790
this out and if you guys follow me on

338
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:52,100
SAP which if you don't you definitely

339
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:53,480
need to I tried out this look a few

340
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:55,340
nights ago and everybody was kind of

341
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,450
shook over I was took over I was so

342
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,770
happy about turned on so I definitely

343
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:59,810
wanted to film a tutorial for you guys

344
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:02,300
I'm using a burnt orange shade on my

345
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:02,840
makeup shock t-33 brush to blend out and

346
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:06,950
deepen it

347
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:08,090
our part of the crease then with that

348
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:09,560
same exact brush I'm going to grab this

349
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:13,070
medium tone Brown up in here and then

350
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:14,360
deep in and out even more I'm gonna take

351
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:15,620
a quick break for my eye shadow for a

352
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,970
second and grab these steel at liquid

353
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:19,460
metals and this is in the shade of

354
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:20,750
kitten karma I'm just gonna use this to

355
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:25,640
carve up my entire eyelid by going

356
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:27,290
slightly right above the crease I'm just

357
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:29,150
gonna close my eyes then fan my eyes to

358
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:30,650
let this dry I am gonna be going back in

359
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,550
with more shadow and liquid liner in

360
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:34,490
just like it and I don't want this

361
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:35,930
glitter to transfer anywhere to do

362
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:37,520
anyway later today I'm gonna use my Wet

363
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:39,320
n Wild mega liner obviously in the shade

364
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,880
of black so basically for the winged

365
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,500
liner we're keeping the same technique

366
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:49,610
as normal just making it a whole lot

367
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:50,930
bigger and thicker now the liner is all

368
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:53,510
on Andrea I'm gonna go back in with my

369
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:55,100
233 brush one last time and actually dip

370
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:56,600
into it the black shade in the Jaclyn

371
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,520
hill palette and just darken out the

372
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,529
outer corners I'm blending this black

373
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:06,470
bolt into the crease add into the

374
00:12:00,529 --> 00:12:07,430
glitter as well for the lower lash line

375
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:09,230
I'm going to start off by lining my

376
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:11,350
waterline using my NYX epic wonder

377
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:11,350
pencil

378
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:19,880
then i got my morphe r43 brush and dip

379
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:22,280
into this warm tone brown up in here and

380
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:23,330
start to defiant the lash line when I

381
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,530
get to this inner corner I'm actually

382
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:26,210
not gonna follow my natural eye shape

383
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:28,340
and I'm going to make this kind of more

384
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:35,870
a straight line to create the effect of

385
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:37,520
a new inner corner then are just gonna

386
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:39,470
take my morphe m4 33 brush and dip into

387
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,820
this a warm tone of orange here and just

388
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:42,380
blend that out last thing I'm gonna

389
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:44,300
actually use a custom pair of stock

390
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:45,620
lashes that I made earlier on and that

391
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,870
is the combination of the makeup Shack

392
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:49,430
matte eye lashes and my 301's

393
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:51,080
now normally I would use just a few

394
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:53,330
pairs of 3:01 stock which are literally

395
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:55,400
humongous as you can see they're like a

396
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:56,960
freakin butterfly wing so this is a more

397
00:12:55,400 --> 00:13:04,130
toned down version of drag these are the

398
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:05,810
perfect combination of lashes if you

399
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:07,520
look closely as well my lash in the

400
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:09,320
inner corner is glued down to the inner

401
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,700
corner as it goes out to the outer lash

402
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,860
line and my lashes actually glued

403
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:14,330
nowhere near my lash line it's probably

404
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:16,250
actually a good half an inch away from

405
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:17,600
my outer corner and the end of the lash

406
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,760
is actually sitting in the middle of the

407
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,750
liner this looks pretty weird close-up

408
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,720
and you definitely don't have to do it

409
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:25,580
by any means but from far away gluing

410
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,170
the lashes up more just helps lift the

411
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:30,710
entire face and really gives you like a

412
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:32,120
snatched look that just looks so so good

413
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:34,070
like I said I'm just gonna take my

414
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:36,380
roller lash mascara and just dip in a

415
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:38,600
little bit and I'm going to connect my

416
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:40,210
regular lashes with these huge ass fake

417
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,410
ones

418
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:44,060
I'm sorry gonna show the ones in the

419
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:45,710
outer course are very very coated and

420
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:47,660
nice and black so they blend into the

421
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:49,040
liner and the lashes because if there's

422
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,600
any powder on them like you can see it

423
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,070
right now it's really gonna mess up the

424
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,540
illusion of having those lashes glue it

425
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:57,170
why higher up if you do decide to do

426
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:58,700
that for highlighter today of course

427
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:00,050
what else do we used in the anasazi

428
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,940
estelle Hollywood illuminator in my

429
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:07,820
morphe M 501 brush

430
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:09,740
ooh pheromone is shaking are you kidding

431
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:11,030
me we've been baking for like an hour

432
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:12,860
now so I'm gonna go ahead and wipe this

433
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:16,870
away oh and see how that just made that

434
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:19,640
cut so nice oh yes

435
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:23,240
using my morphe m4 3-1 i'm also going to

436
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:24,560
highlight Lino's you definitely be very

437
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,270
very careful in highlighting as well

438
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,760
because a nose contour highlight can

439
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:30,410
definitely make or break a drag look and

440
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,570
you definitely ought to be super snatch

441
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:33,470
is possible so I'm also gonna grab a

442
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:35,450
flat top brush and I'm going to

443
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:37,400
highlight my brow bone today now this is

444
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:38,570
your first time doing drag I definitely

445
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,580
would not recommend doing this because

446
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:42,440
highlighting obviously adds and this is

447
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:44,060
a texture to any area and if this is

448
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:46,490
your first time covering a brows unless

449
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:47,480
you are some miracle worker because Lord

450
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:49,130
knows that took me a whole lot of

451
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,900
practice they might look a little bit

452
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:52,730
texture for the first time it just takes

453
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,750
a whole lot of practice but once you get

454
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:55,220
really good at covering your brows and

455
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,540
they're nice and flat like this one is

456
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:58,220
even this one's a little bit wonky but

457
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:01,790
this one's nice and flat see how that

458
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:02,690
bra how they just look so good yes for

459
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:04,430
my lips today I'm gonna start off with

460
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:08,140
the Mac lip pencil in the shade of whirl

461
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:08,140
and just over line them a lot

462
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:16,630
so we definitely went way overboard with

463
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,370
the overlining but that is definitely

464
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:20,020
the point dragon makeup is super super

465
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:22,180
over accentuated and just big and

466
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:23,980
beautiful in general so I'm next in with

467
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:25,390
the Oprah South Paolo liquid lipstick

468
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:30,550
and just fill everything in for some

469
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:31,750
nice juicy for luxurious lips and last

470
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:33,280
but certainly not least I'm gonna set my

471
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:36,120
face in place using my Urban Decay all

472
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,120
nighter setting spray

473
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:42,250
alright guys so that has to look all

474
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,050
complete but we all know the drag is a

475
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,070
whole lot more than just makeup so I'm

476
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:46,720
gonna go ahead and change it up and

477
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:48,400
quickly put on the wig and I'll be right

478
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,170
back with the finished look alright guys

479
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:52,840
so this is the no makeup natural

480
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:54,190
everyday woman total complete just

481
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,540
kidding obviously this is a very very

482
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:57,430
full intense struggle and I absolutely

483
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:59,350
love how this turned out as you guys saw

484
00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:00,970
I pretty much did use all of my everyday

485
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:02,440
makeup products that are using most of

486
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:04,450
my looks there's been a very different

487
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:06,340
and more intense way and this is the dry

488
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:07,600
