more days to go in our countdown

25
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,600
so until then let's jump into it today's

26
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,680
YouTube video as you all know right now

27
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,230
we're going through a global pandemic

28
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,030
because of Koba at 19 we are all doing

29
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,680
our best to stay at home and stay safe

30
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,360
and stay healthy in order to beat this

31
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,430
together and because of this quarantine

32
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,410
there's been a major surge in the app

33
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:03,090
called zoom if you don't know what zoom

34
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,619
is basically it is like an online of

35
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,240
video chatting software similar to

36
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:07,799
FaceTime or Skype where you can keep in

37
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,659
contact or host meetings with large

38
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:10,799
groups of people a lot of teachers have

39
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:12,330
been hosting zoom classes with their

40
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,470
students to conduct their online classes

41
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,640
I've had to use that a bunch different

42
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:16,020
times for business meetings that I

43
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,369
couldn't actually get to in-person but

44
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,869
overall a lot of people are just using

45
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:19,950
it to stay in touch with their friends

46
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:21,330
first today's video I thought it'd be

47
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,799
really fun to try to you zoom in a

48
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:24,180
slightly different way by the way this

49
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,710
video is not sponsored and now that I'm

50
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,909
thinking about it I really should have

51
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,530
reached out beforehand because this is

52
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:30,240
literally an infomercial anyways I

53
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,530
tweeted earlier telling you guys to grab

54
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,450
your friends and grab your makeup

55
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,460
collections and tweet me at your Zoo ID

56
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,259
and passcode and now I'm here in my

57
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,939
studio with Mya makeup collection I have

58
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:40,619
nothing on my face right now so I

59
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:42,030
thought it would be super fun to pop in

60
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:44,130
and surprise you guys under different

61
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,620
zoom calls and get ready with you let's

62
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:51,060
get started

63
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:53,500

64
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,090
okay you guys we have our zoom open and
