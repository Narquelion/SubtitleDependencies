00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,959
one week ago I uploaded a video to my

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:05,279
youtube channel titled Tati this video

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:06,810
was a direct response to the video that

4
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,630
Tati Westberg uploaded to her channel

5
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:11,610
titled by a sister before I say anything

6
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:14,250
at all in this video I want to make it

7
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,929
very very clear that everything I said

8
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,090
in that video in regards to it my

9
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:21,539
sentiments towards Tati and my apology I

10
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:23,279
stand behind 100% and still rain true I

11
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:24,869
know I got emotional in the video I

12
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,490
apologize it was something very very

13
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:27,689
hard for him to deal with especially

14
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,550
when it came to talking about my very

15
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:30,960
own mother in talk to his video she

16
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,579
discusses many of the different reasons

17
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,050
as to why she was choosing to close a

18
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:36,090
chapter in her life that I was heavily

19
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:39,270
involved in making many of our private

20
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:40,649
issues very very very public and now

21
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,850
millions and millions of people have

22
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:43,620
weighed in with their opinions and

23
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,020
speculations on subjects that they

24
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,579
honestly know absolutely nothing about I

25
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,690
will not ask for sympathy and I will

26
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:50,730
definitely not ask for forgiveness

27
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,559
either but I will ask that you watch

28
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,780
this entire thing all the way through

29
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,730
before forming any further opinions or

30
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,379
talking about this story more hello

31
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,030
future James here popping in quickly

32
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:02,579
I know doing an insert in a video like

33
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,589
this is not professional trust me but I

34
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:06,659
filmed this several times now and as

35
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:08,220
time keeps going on more and more things

36
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:09,810
keep coming out into the public and more

37
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,250
people are speaking on the situation and

38
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,229
it is very important to me that this

39
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,210
video has all the information all the

40
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:16,439
facts all the receipts and is current

41
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,240
and present because I will not be

42
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:20,100
addressing it again after this matter

43
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,380
this morning when I was editing this

44
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,759
video I noticed that last night totsied

45
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,979
uploaded a video to her channel called

46
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,420
why I did it and this morning Geoffrey

47
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:29,490
Starr was on snapchat talking about the

48
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,259
whole situation first and foremost I do

49
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,420
want to issue a thank you to both

50
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:34,710
Jeffrey and Tati for taking some of the

51
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,710
responsibility for blowing this whole

52
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:39,509
thing up and for starting everything I

53
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,009
really respect that a lot and I also

54
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:43,079
appreciate the fact that they are trying

55
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:44,520
to redirect the hate away because I

56
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:47,189
think we're all aware at this point that

57
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,570
it has gotten way too far the past week

58
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:50,909
on the Internet has been at the darkest

59
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:52,259
I think we've all ever seen and it's

60
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:54,299
also been the darkest time that I've

61
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:57,469
ever had to go through and my life and

62
00:01:54,299 --> 00:02:00,689
my thoughts gone to a really scary place

63
00:01:57,469 --> 00:02:02,430
watching takis video it's clear to me

64
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:04,799
that she also is in a really dark place

65
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:07,079
as well and has been pained by this

66
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,280
whole situation if I've known anything

67
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:11,069
about talk to you over the past three

68
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,370
years it says she has a huge huge heart

69
00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:14,500
there's no tonight

70
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:15,819
and I think that or I do believe her

71
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,580
when she says that she did not want this

72
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:20,260
to get so vile I don't really think any

73
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:22,299
of us thought it's gonna be as big as it

74
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,560
really was in both of their videos

75
00:02:22,299 --> 00:02:25,000
Jeffrey and Tati both mentioned that

76
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,470
they hope that I'm able to change and

77
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,590
then we can all move on from the

78
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:31,209
situation and trust me I agree there's

79
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,659
nobody that wants it's over with as much

80
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:33,760
as I do

81
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:35,799
but in takis second video and in Jeffrey

82
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,510
snapshots they both said that they stand

83
00:02:35,799 --> 00:02:39,610
behind everything that they mentioned

84
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:41,560
and unfortunately there have been

85
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:43,480
allegations made against me because of

86
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,209
these things and I don't really feel

87
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:48,069
comfortable just moving on from those I

88
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:49,390
would like to take this video today as

89
00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:51,640
an opportunity to kind of explain

90
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:54,280
everything that has happened and address

91
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,450
literally everything there's a lot that

92
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,950
happened behind the scenes leading off

93
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:58,690
to talk days video and there's a lot

94
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:01,629
that happened behind the scenes and

95
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:03,159
publicly after takis video and I feel so

96
00:03:01,629 --> 00:03:04,569
it is my responsibility to kind of let

97
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:06,760
you guys in on those because there's a

98
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:09,340
lot of misinformation going around and

99
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,690
it's just not really good just like

100
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,970
talking said in her video this whole

101
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,290
situation is a lot bigger in the despite

102
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:15,970
immense and I think anybody who's kind

103
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:18,190
of followed the situation is well aware

104
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:19,870
of that at this point trust me I am too

105
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:21,370
there are way bigger issues here that I

106
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:23,049
will be discussing and talking openly

107
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:24,970
and honestly about later on in this

108
00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:25,959
video I have a few notes in front of me

109
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:27,609
here and I want to make sure that I hit

110
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:30,489
every single point and that I don't miss

111
00:03:27,609 --> 00:03:32,049
anything but that being said to get to

112
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:33,579
those issues this did start with

113
00:03:32,049 --> 00:03:35,200
vitamins it was kind of the catalyst so

114
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:36,790
I want to make sure we kind of go in

115
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,230
order and you guys are able to get the

116
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:40,150
full context and full story of

117
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:41,680
everything if that has happened starting

118
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,660
off my friends and I all tend to

119
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,849
Coachella weekend one from April 11th

120
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:48,160
through 15th and I had an artist pass

121
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:49,959
provided to me by a brand we had a

122
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,220
really really good weekend I mean you

123
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:53,379
guys saw the snapshots Instagram

124
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,579
pictures and outfits and my video it was

125
00:03:53,379 --> 00:03:57,549
really really fun and we will definitely

126
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:58,870
never forget it but at Coachella I had

127
00:03:57,549 --> 00:04:01,389
drama with a boy that I had been talking

128
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:03,760
with for five months prior and it all

129
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:06,069
kind of clouded at the overall memories

130
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,840
later on at that very same week on April

131
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:09,790
19th my best friends and I in the family

132
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,840
group chat made the last-minute decision

133
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:13,120
that we wanted to attend Coachella

134
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,940
weekend to again to kind of relive those

135
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,919
memories but boy free I texted my

136
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:19,209
manager Jake that very same night asking

137
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,459
it to be possible to get us in for the

138
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:23,620
next day since it was already Friday we

139
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:25,330
nee were missing the first day of the

140
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:27,460
festival so therefore we could only go

141
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:29,050
on Saturday because it was so at last

142
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,970
second we were only able to get VIP

143
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:33,039
tickets which is not the same as artists

144
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:35,080
but we had it over anyway and wanted to

145
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:35,949
have a really really good time for those

146
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,389
of you who may not be familiar with

147
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:38,889
Coachella I do want to quickly clarify

148
00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:40,479
the different passes just because it

149
00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:43,150
kind of is important to this whole

150
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:45,099
situation if the IP although VIP is

151
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:46,960
still very very open to the public

152
00:04:45,099 --> 00:04:49,750
artists passes however our passes that

153
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,949
you can not buy the only way you can get

154
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:53,020
a hold of them is through a brand

155
00:04:50,949 --> 00:04:54,699
getting them from the actual festival or

156
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:56,289
through having a personal connection to

157
00:04:54,699 --> 00:04:58,000
one of the artists or bands that are

158
00:04:56,289 --> 00:05:00,669
playing it's in a very very highly

159
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,409
secured area that is not open to the

160
00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:03,400
public a lot of artist passes though

161
00:05:02,409 --> 00:05:05,289
there's also something called a

162
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,669
performer pass and backstage passes and

163
00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:09,280
a lot of other things that can keep you

164
00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:11,169
more protected keep in mind weekend one

165
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,469
I did have an artist past weekend - I

166
00:05:11,169 --> 00:05:15,849
had a VIP going into the situation when

167
00:05:14,469 --> 00:05:18,490
we walked into weekend 2 with me my

168
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:20,979
friends on a Saturday April 20th and

169
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:22,870
Sunday April 21st we notice that there

170
00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:24,819
was a major major difference and at the

171
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:26,409
crowd we were in the VIP section and I

172
00:05:24,819 --> 00:05:28,330
started getting mobbed really really

173
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:29,770
quickly at a super unsafe capacity

174
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:31,270
because as many of you guys know when

175
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:32,860
I've always stopped to take a photo kind

176
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:34,659
of other people tend to come and it just

177
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:37,060
turns into a big situation and it

178
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:38,889
honestly it was not safe I had

179
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:40,509
remembered from weekend one that my

180
00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:42,370
friend Nikita driving home is with a lot

181
00:05:40,509 --> 00:05:44,380
of the time was brought by sugar bear

182
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:46,210
hair and had an artist pass personal

183
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:48,759
security and backstage passes and was

184
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:50,710
very very taken care of and safe what I

185
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:52,539
felt unsafe in the situation I panicked

186
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:54,159
and I text Nikita and asked her if she

187
00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:56,500
had a connection to the sugar bear hair

188
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:58,479
team that could potentially help me out

189
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,279
Nikita replied right away and she gave

190
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,810
the sugar bear hair team at my personal

191
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:04,029
phone number to which they reached out

192
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:06,250
to me and offered to come rescue me with

193
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:07,870
a pass and backstage access and security

194
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,400
to make sure that I was okay and was

195
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:11,770
able to enjoy the festival along with my

196
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:14,409
friends you went to Coachella somehow

197
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:15,909
had a security issue and magically sugar

198
00:06:14,409 --> 00:06:17,469
bear hair is there with a contract in

199
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:19,779
hand to save the day for you and all of

200
00:06:17,469 --> 00:06:21,969
your friends no company would ever go

201
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:24,219
out of their way to have an extra you

202
00:06:21,969 --> 00:06:26,379
know handful of passes that cost

203
00:06:24,219 --> 00:06:28,599
thousands of dollars apiece

204
00:06:26,379 --> 00:06:29,979
like just in case that leads me to

205
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:31,840
believe that this was orchestrated

206
00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:34,899
beforehand but he had an emotional

207
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,240
conflict because of me and promises he

208
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:37,849
made

209
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:40,099
me behind the scenes so he had to come

210
00:06:37,849 --> 00:06:41,870
up with a very clever story and didn't

211
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:44,720
tell me right when he got back but after

212
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:46,400
the little bit was posted on their

213
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,930
launch day despite we talked you said in

214
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,849
her video of this whole situation was

215
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,919
definitely not a big scheme that was

216
00:06:49,849 --> 00:06:53,660
orchestrated beforehand it really did

217
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,250
happen on the spot the sugar bear hair

218
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:57,169
team texted me their proposal right away

219
00:06:55,250 --> 00:07:00,110
no money was involved and with no time

220
00:06:57,169 --> 00:07:01,819
to negotiate in a panic I signed and

221
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:04,789
that was out on that James Charles he

222
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:07,310
had nine days after Coachella to talk to

223
00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:09,979
me on Monday April 22nd which was one

224
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:12,139
day after Coachella I was due to post my

225
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:13,880
stories based on my contract and up

226
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:15,169
until that moment I honestly had not

227
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,550
thought about the fact that talk to you

228
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:17,990
was a sugar bear hair a competitor and

229
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:19,729
in that moment I thought that as a

230
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:20,750
friend she deserved a courtesy text to

231
00:07:19,729 --> 00:07:22,159
let her know the context on the

232
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:24,860
sponsorship and everything that was

233
00:07:22,159 --> 00:07:27,949
going on to not even get a phone call to

234
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:30,889
not even get a text a few days prior but

235
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:33,620
right after that sponsored post went up

236
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:36,440
to have a text like hey mom love you I'm

237
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:38,539
stressed just so you know XYZ I just did

238
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,699
this post but it's no big before posting

239
00:07:38,539 --> 00:07:42,469
my stories I actually did text 20 first

240
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:43,820
out of respect for her giving her heads

241
00:07:42,469 --> 00:07:45,979
up about the sponsorship but she was

242
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:47,900
immediately upset I try my best to kind

243
00:07:45,979 --> 00:07:50,240
of explain the entire situation and also

244
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,800
gave her a direct apology as well but at

245
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,870
this point I had signed the contract and

246
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,060
I absolutely had to post it there was no

247
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:57,560
getting out of it I then headed to the

248
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,190
airport and took off on a flight to San

249
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,840
Francisco

250
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:01,669
by the time that I had landed a one hour

251
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,320
later talk to you - uploaded all of her

252
00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:04,520
Instagram stories of her crying talking

253
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,139
about the friends the community that

254
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,880
haven't really supported her how she was

255
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:10,280
alone and how she felt very very hurt

256
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,479
and betrayed very quickly people put two

257
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,610
and two together and realized that this

258
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:14,780
was clearly about me and I started

259
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:16,849
getting thousands and thousands of

260
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:18,620
tweets and comments and texts about the

261
00:08:16,849 --> 00:08:20,630
whole situation throughout the next

262
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:22,460
several hours I made countless attempts

263
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:24,830
at text both Tati and her husband James

264
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:26,539
and many phone calls as well trying to

265
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:28,280
reach them all of which they did not

266
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:29,840
respond to and later on that night while

267
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,759
sitting in my hotel in San Francisco

268
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,440
because I could not reach talk to you I

269
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,469
assured a public apology directly on my

270
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,000
Instagram because

271
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:38,310
I really wanted to make sure she saw

272
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,449
that I was sorry and I wanted to end the

273
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:41,969
situation by taking full responsibility

274
00:08:39,449 --> 00:08:44,190
for my actions over the next several

275
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:46,529
days I made countless attempts to

276
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:48,360
contact both Tati and her husband James

277
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:50,430
on all their different phone numbers I

278
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,259
texted and called a Tottie's business

279
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:53,879
number her family number and also

280
00:08:52,259 --> 00:08:56,220
James's personal phone number as well

281
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:57,600
after a full entire week of trying to

282
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,860
reach out and handle things in private

283
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,779
with Tati on her husband James and

284
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:02,279
getting no response I figured at this

285
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:03,930
time it'd be best to just respect their

286
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:05,220
space give them their privacy and that

287
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:06,930
whenever talked to is ready she was

288
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,819
reached back out to me to handle things

289
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:11,550
in private and hopefully move on with

290
00:09:08,819 --> 00:09:12,899
our friendship that is everything in

291
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:14,459
regards to the Instagram stories that

292
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:15,660
we've talked about that I want to

293
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:16,860
discuss a few of the things and talk to

294
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,839
this video that were misleading and

295
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,790
false the reason that James always said

296
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:22,350
that he couldn't promote halo on his

297
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:24,540
channel and really do like you know

298
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:25,829
heavy endorsement was because he has a

299
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,360
teenage audience and it would just be

300
00:09:25,829 --> 00:09:28,800
inappropriate now this thing was just

301
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,829
confusing to me mostly because this

302
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,000
conversation never actually happened if

303
00:09:31,829 --> 00:09:34,439
you guys know my channel you know that I

304
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,689
don't really do dedicated product

305
00:09:34,439 --> 00:09:39,329
reviews ever which is what Tati is known

306
00:09:36,689 --> 00:09:41,250
for but even though that is the case I

307
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:42,480
have still multiple times that talked

308
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,339
about her products are almost social

309
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,560
media networks I have to worry okay I

310
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:48,120
forgot to say - hello I'm going to a

311
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,910
really important event later on tonight

312
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,259
my best friend we are going to yes this

313
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,579
is true and this is a very important

314
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:54,870
loss to me because it is my best friend

315
00:09:53,579 --> 00:09:56,699
- mopti it she's launching something new

316
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:58,079

most who doesn't need a little beauty

321
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:06,720
boost every now and then - the following

322
00:10:04,589 --> 00:10:11,759
statements are real claims made by your

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:13,230
original halo beauty booster so oh can I

brand mom I did not tell talk to you

that I was buying these going to pay for

330
00:10:25,909 --> 00:10:32,659
these myself because I just wanted to

331
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:34,639
support her and I'm so happy because I

332
00:10:32,659 --> 00:10:36,199
know she's worked so hard on these for

333
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:37,699
the past several years now

334
00:10:36,199 --> 00:10:41,809

335
00:10:37,699 --> 00:10:43,249
little you so much I do want to keep

336
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:45,319
this video strictly based on facts and

337
00:10:43,249 --> 00:10:47,569
receipts but one of the most hurtful

338
00:10:45,319 --> 00:10:49,099
things taki did and her video it was

339
00:10:47,569 --> 00:10:52,429
bring up my mom and questions her

340
00:10:49,099 --> 00:10:55,099
parenting no tears this time my mom is

341
00:10:52,429 --> 00:10:56,869
the strongest woman I have ever met she

342
00:10:55,099 --> 00:10:59,119
is kind she is creative and she is

343
00:10:56,869 --> 00:11:01,249
caring she is a cancer survivor and she

344
00:10:59,119 --> 00:11:04,219
balances a marriage a full-time job and

345
00:11:01,249 --> 00:11:06,319
raising two boys absolutely crazy lives

346
00:11:04,219 --> 00:11:07,069
she's taught me so much in the past and

347
00:11:06,319 --> 00:11:09,379
when I made a mistake

348
00:11:07,069 --> 00:11:11,629
she has never turned to public

349
00:11:09,379 --> 00:11:13,579
humiliation as a form of punishment all

350
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:15,949
that being said I love my mom and I

351
00:11:13,579 --> 00:11:16,939
think she's doing a damn good job if I

352
00:11:15,949 --> 00:11:18,799
do say so myself

353
00:11:16,939 --> 00:11:20,589
the last phone conversation that James

354
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:23,059
Charles and I had he said some things

355
00:11:20,589 --> 00:11:24,709
telling me about a situation that

356
00:11:23,059 --> 00:11:27,919
happened in Seattle at my birthday and

357
00:11:24,709 --> 00:11:30,169
it literally made me want to vomit oh my

358
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:32,629
god you tried to trick a straight man

359
00:11:30,169 --> 00:11:35,929
into thinking he's gay yet again and

360
00:11:32,629 --> 00:11:39,079
somehow you're the victim you know it's

361
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:42,379
really disgusting to manipulate

362
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:44,539
someone's sexuality especially when they

363
00:11:42,379 --> 00:11:46,399
are still you know emerging into

364
00:11:44,539 --> 00:11:48,439
adulthood and don't quite have

365
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:51,139
everything figured out you are using

366
00:11:48,439 --> 00:11:52,939
your fame your power your money to play

367
00:11:51,139 --> 00:11:56,389
with people's emotions and you're doing

368
00:11:52,939 --> 00:11:58,249
that to have them behave sexually in

369
00:11:56,389 --> 00:12:00,079
your favor even if they're straight and

370
00:11:58,249 --> 00:12:02,089
you know what that's not okay and how

371
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,919
dare you laugh about it and make me

372
00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:05,389
master meme and retweet and this and

373
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:08,329
that and I love straight boys I love

374
00:12:05,389 --> 00:12:10,579
straight boys and make it a joke because

375
00:12:08,329 --> 00:12:11,239
this behavior is not normal it's not

376
00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:13,970
okay

377
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:16,969
cracking someone's sexuality is not an

378
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:19,999
escape room first of all I am a 19 year

379
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:21,529
old virgin I talk about boys quite a lot

380
00:12:19,999 --> 00:12:22,639
of my social media networks clearly at

381
00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:23,029
this point and it's not acceptable

382
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,529
anymore

383
00:12:23,029 --> 00:12:26,720
we're talking about that a little bit I

384
00:12:24,529 --> 00:12:27,979
promise you but just thought I would

385
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,169
bring it up put it out into the universe

386
00:12:27,979 --> 00:12:31,700
I don't really get a lot of action

387
00:12:30,169 --> 00:12:34,490
we have probably guessed this at this

388
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:38,030
so that being said I have never and

389
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:41,240
would never and will never use my fame

390
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:44,270
money or power to manipulate or get any

391
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:47,360
sexual actions from a guy that is

392
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:50,450
disgusting it is not me and the fact

393
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,640
that Tati brought this up blows my mind

394
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:53,600
because she knows the real story the

395
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,130
story that were talking about here is a

396
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,050
situation that happened when I was in

397
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:59,930
Seattle for talking surprise party with

398
00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:01,820
a boy named Sam now I'm going to tell

399
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:04,220
you the full story since everybody seems

400
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:05,450
to be leaving out literally every single

401
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,950
detail in talk to each video she

402
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:09,140
mentioned that she was disgusted and had

403
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:10,640
to apologize to her family for me

404
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:13,010
apparently saying things that I wanted

405
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,810
to do to a waiter and then just to find

406
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:19,040
those actions by saying I have a

407
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:21,800
celebrity okay this literally did not

408
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,900
happen what did happen is that me

409
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,640
Jeffrey Nate - my best friend drew all

410
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:27,800
flew to Seattle to surprise talk to you

411
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:29,180
for her birthday on February 14th that

412
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,680
night we went out to dinner with that

413
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:32,750
with Tontine James and her whole family

414
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:34,100
and we're in a restaurant there was a

415
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,870
cute boy across the restaurant that I

416
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:37,370
kept making eye contact with and that I

417
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:39,860
was interested in and the conversation

418
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:41,000
of dating for me and Jeffrey both came

419
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,320
up the dinner table and we were talking

420
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,710
about it for a very very short period of

421
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,510
time the conversation never got

422
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:49,310
inappropriate period the boy that was

423
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:50,330
involved in the story is named Sam now

424
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:52,190
when I originally wanted to do this

425
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,600
video addressing everything I did plan

426
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:55,760
on crossing his name and keeping him

427
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,110
completely private but he has since come

428
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,700
out and made a video of his oh not

429
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:00,050
talking about the situation just like

430
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:03,080
talk to you leading out many many

431
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:04,340
details but in his video and in the

432
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,560
screenshots that I have Sam mentioned

433
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:08,660
that he was perfectly fine and found the

434
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,520
flirting that I was doing flattering so

435
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:12,650
I'm not really sure why this got turned

436
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:14,870
into something much bigger but it simply

437
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:22,520
was not he was looking at me later on

438
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:24,350
that night he started asking me if I had

439
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:26,150
a Valentine this is this was on

440
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:27,800
Valentine's Day where he especially

441
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:29,100
thought that I was very attractive and

442
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,680
he wanted to get my phone

443
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:33,840
and all that but the waitstaff at my

444
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,450
restaurant didn't let that happen

445
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:39,020
he left and it kind of just went and

446
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:41,790
talked about the Imus Liberty thing is

447
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:43,560
really incredibly frustrating to me

448
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:45,210
because this is an inside joke between

449
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:47,250
my friends and I had that Tati is also

450
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:48,690
participated in and she twisted this to

451
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:51,330
be something far worse than what it is

452
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:53,310
this is the joke that really is where we

453
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:54,780
say I'm famous not I'm a celebrity and

454
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:56,640
it's thing that we don't say it in

455
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:59,310
public very often because without

456
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:03,800
context I get it it looks and sounds

457
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:06,630
really really bad trust me literally

458
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:08,700
famous is synonymous of anything good so

459
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:09,840
yeah my YouTube video does well one day

460
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,610
my friends was like oh my god James are

461
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,110
so famous but literally if my friend

462
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:14,970
takes a good Instagram photo oh my god

463
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:17,010
you're so famous if our boneless buffalo

464
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:19,410
wings that Chili's are extra delicious

465
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:22,290
one day oh my god these wings are so so

466
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:24,720
famous it has nothing to do at all with

467
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:26,640
fame power or money which is what Tati

468
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,650
eluded it to being and it is so

469
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:30,030
frustrating that she turned an innocent

470
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:32,610
and funny inside joke that she has

471
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:34,830
participated in into something so beyond

472
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:37,680
disgusting I'm going to try my best to

473
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:40,020
make it a long story very short the next

474
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,610
day Sampson into my DMS first and I

475
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,840
happened to see it we started talking

476
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:44,760
back and forth and he mentioned that he

477
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:46,290
was flattered by me flirting with him at

478
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,900
the night before head sorry about last

479
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:51,900
night you're very attractive and then I

480
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:53,100
was very flattering actually a few

481
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,600
minutes into the conversation I asked

482
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:57,600
about his sexuality and he told me

483
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:59,850
straight up that he was bisexual oh my

484
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,650
god you tried to trick a straight man

485
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:03,240
into thinking he's gay there was no

486
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:04,680
straight man at being manipulated

487
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,110
anywhere in this story like Tati

488
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,970
mentioned later on in the conversation

489
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:10,620
he asked when I was leaving Seattle and

490
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:12,030
I told him the next morning to which he

491
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,830
responded I wish we had time to hang out

492
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:15,180
and I said hey why do you come over to

493
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,720
my hotel tonight we can watch a movie

494
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:18,930
together

495
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:20,940
he said sounds good later on he messaged

496
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:21,930
me first and told me hey straight up

497
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:24,090
I've never done anything with a guy

498
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:26,160
before I'm a little bit nervous too

499
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:28,260
which I told him there was absolutely no

500
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,510
pressure this is all shown in the

501
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:32,190
screenshots Sam showed up at the hotel

502
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:34,470
we watched movies together and we

503
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:36,990
cuddled after the movie I asked him if

504
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:40,350
he wanted to kiss to which he said yes I

505
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:42,510
get to the hotel room we say hi it's all

506
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:44,370
fine we had watching a movie and

507
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:46,740
after that movie he asked to kiss me I

508
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:50,310
said yes and we ended up making out for

509
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:53,510
around an hour and if I'm being honest

510
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:56,310
he's the worst kisser I've ever kissed

511
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:58,680
way too much time all right

512
00:16:56,310 --> 00:17:00,510
note taken um after making out Sam for

513
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:02,220
over an hour I did invite him to sleep

514
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:03,930
over at the hotel and he kept telling

515
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:05,970
you to stay like please say please say

516
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:07,199
don't leave me all this knob and I

517
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:08,670
really wanted to go home

518
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,170
so I left of course I want to spend more

519
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:11,459
time with him but he said that he wanted

520
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:12,510
to go home and be in his own bed and

521
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:14,130
think about everything that was going on

522
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:15,870
because it was quite a lot and I

523
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:18,870
definitely understood and did not blame

524
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:20,130
him he then left and sent me a message

525
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:21,510
afterwards thanking you for being so

526
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:22,470
understanding and I told him that I

527
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:24,870
would always be there for him if he

528
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:26,550
needed literally anything point being

529
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:29,610
everything that happened in the hotel

530
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:31,830
room was 100% consensual and this is

531
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:32,880
confirmed I said yes by the only two

532
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:35,670
parties that were actually they are

533
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,110
being myself and Sam after this night

534
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:38,940
Sam when I continued to talk for the

535
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:39,600
next several weeks at first it was

536
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,280
really really great

537
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,840
but I noticed that his feelings towards

538
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,240
me and sexuality were kind of wavering

539
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,860
quite a lot and I came to the collusion

540
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,420
that he needed to figure himself out and

541
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:50,160
that I needed to move on because I kept

542
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:51,660
getting hurt last important note to keep

543
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,480
in mind about the timeline of the whole

544
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:56,400
situation on May 2nd Sam texted me from

545
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,470
his friend's phone saying that he was

546
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,810
fully gay I needed to talk to me about

547
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:02,610
something important I called him and

548
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:03,960
instead talking about that he asked me

549
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:05,430
if I was talking to another guy at the

550
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,960
same time that I was talking to him I

551
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:08,550
was a little bit confused as to I as

552
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,230
being asked this but I did answer him

553
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:12,300
honestly and then I asked him what made

554
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:13,560
him come to conclusion with everything

555
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:16,680
to what she said

556
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:18,540
I'm actually not fully okay after doing

557
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:21,030
this a million times I was frustrated

558
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:23,190
and I hung up just to clarify so there

559
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:25,320
are no further questions the point of

560
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:28,380
including this screenshot is not to out

561
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:30,480
Sam Sam texted me saying he was fully

562
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:32,160
gay but it was a trap to get me on

563
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,930
FaceTime so he could illegally record

564
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,970
the conversation to include in the video

565
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:37,410
that he was planning later on like I

566
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:38,790
said at the end of the conversation I

567
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:41,280
asked and how he came to this conclusion

568
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:42,780
and then he told me he was not fully gay

569
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,240
to which I hung up out of frustration

570
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:48,510
later on he texted me saying he was

571
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:50,790
confirmed by this is why in Sam's video

572
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:52,320
he included a screenshot of me telling

573
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:54,270
him I did not think he was fully

574
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,990
straight this comment had a lot of

575
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,580
people really up

576
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:58,410
and confused as to why I was telling

577
00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:00,090
somebody their sexuality but there's a

578
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:02,100
very simple explanation Stan when I

579
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:03,780
talked for a very very long time and his

580
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:05,400
sexuality like I said wavered a lot

581
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:06,780
every time that he was a little bit

582
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,280
confused we had open and honest

583
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:10,470
conversations about it and he always

584
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,390
asked me of my input and I gave it to

585
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:13,920
him I would never out somebody and I

586
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:16,170
have never ever tried to manipulate

587
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:18,059
somebody's sexuality including his

588
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:19,530
point-blank period the whole situation

589
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:21,660
that happened with Sam was very very

590
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:23,670
long and complicated and left both of us

591
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:25,290
very hurt and confused and through

592
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:26,730
trying to do this I reached out to many

593
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:28,260
of my different friends for advice um

594
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:30,510
there was one night in my kitchen where

595
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:32,340
Tatia James and Gabriel all came over

596
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:33,780
and I told them the same exact story and

597
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:36,600
showed them the same exact screenshots

598
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:38,010
to all of you guys just saw after

599
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,050
hearing this like Tati said in her video

600
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,220
Tati and James actually did have a

601
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:42,660
heart-to-heart conversation with me

602
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:44,130
about the boys that I could involve with

603
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,480
they told me that talking to curious

604
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:47,940
guys was going to continue to get me

605
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,990
hurt and that also it could look really

606
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:51,360
really bad from an outside perspective

607
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:53,490
if somebody tried to manipulate the

608
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,900
situation and for me this is a major

609
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:57,000
major wake-up call that I took to heart

610
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,890
because I honestly had never thought

611
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,970
about it and any other way because I

612
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:01,830
knew that everything that I was doing

613
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:03,960
was always consensual between both me

614
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:06,240
and the boy and I had receipts to back

615
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,830
it up but I wished I knew at the time

616
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,290
that Todd his advice was really a

617
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:12,120
warning because she did exactly what she

618
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:14,340
told me someone else may which was

619
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:17,190
telling my story with no details no

620
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:19,380
facts and no proof and twisted around

621
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:20,670
and now serious allegations have

622
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:22,740
surfaced that could permanently damage

623
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:24,179
my career now like I said the talk that

624
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:25,530
happened in my kitchen I really did

625
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:27,360
appreciate because it was the first time

626
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:29,610
I kind of took a step back and was able

627
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,050
to analyze what was going on and this

628
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:33,420
week has been a major eye-opener for me

629
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:36,540
as well I want to take a brief moment to

630
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:38,070
talk about boys boys have obviously met

631
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:40,260
a talent that has been discussed quite

632
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:42,059
in detail on my youtube channel and

633
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:44,550
social media networks this is no secret

634
00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:45,960
I wish it hadn't been but if I'm gonna

635
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:47,700
talk about at one last time I definitely

636
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,380
want to be open and honest with you guys

637
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,940
the ones who matter I got out of the

638
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:53,100
closet as gay at age 12 which is

639
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:55,440
honestly really really young to kind of

640
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:57,000
figure all of that out I have two other

641
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,590
boys at school at the time who were gay

642
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,660
but we were all close friends so nothing

643
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:02,220
was happening there if you know what I

644
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,570
mean but all my other friends were

645
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,340
having their first kiss underneath the

646
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:06,900
playground slide or getting into their

647
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,590
first relationship and talking all about

648
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:10,140
it

649
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:11,940
and for me I was on poptropica and

650
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:13,260
social media networks trying to make

651
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:15,450
friends and trying to find out what else

652
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:17,220
I was interested in I never really got

653
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:18,870
the opportunity to experiment with love

654
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,860
and learn from that as a growing

655
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:21,900
teenager and I think that that's

656
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:23,789
honestly left me kind of underdeveloped

657
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:25,500
as a person in a lot of different ways

658
00:21:23,789 --> 00:21:26,940
I've been forced to grow very very

659
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,740
quickly because of the job that I work

660
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:31,200
in in social media which I know excited

661
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:32,690
million times beforehand but love and

662
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,640
relationships is something that I have

663
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:38,070
barely any experience in and I honestly

664
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:39,960
think that that's why I'm a lot less

665
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:42,450
mature than others maybe in the

666
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:44,669
situations that I get myself into um I

667
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:46,590
definitely am emotional and I like it

668
00:21:44,669 --> 00:21:49,770
the best me sometimes I can be dramatic

669
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:52,289
I'm reactive I'm forward I'm flirty and

670
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:55,529
these are qualities that I'm not

671
00:21:52,289 --> 00:21:56,580
necessarily proud of at all but I can

672
00:21:55,529 --> 00:21:58,169
confidently say that with each

673
00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:00,899
experience I'm learning more and more

674
00:21:58,169 --> 00:22:03,419
and I've been able to better myself but

675
00:22:00,899 --> 00:22:05,940
a lot of times these situations have

676
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:08,100
become public my own fault my own fault

677
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:11,730
but having millions of people watching

678
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:12,840
you learn can be very very tricky when

679
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:14,700
it comes to experiences that I've

680
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,140
learned from in the past a lot of times

681
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,960
I've talked about being in two straight

682
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:21,299
guys now this conversation is saying

683
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,250
that has upset and also confused quite a

684
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:24,630
lot of people so in order to provide a

685
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:26,399
little bit more context I would like to

686
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:28,230
play a clip from Todd his friend Jeffrey

687
00:22:26,399 --> 00:22:29,549
Starr's video titled the truth about my

688
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:32,309
relationship but a single for a long

689
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:35,700
time and the reason why is because I am

690
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:37,799
really not attracted to anyone but what

691
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:41,279
we call in this world as a straight male

692
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:43,169
or a normal dude and what I mean by that

693
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:45,059
is like you know I am really into

694
00:22:43,169 --> 00:22:48,179
straight guys and I know that is going

695
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:49,260
to not be surprising to a lot of you so

696
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:51,600
you know from just travelling everywhere

697
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:53,760
and meeting dudes all the time and being

698
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:57,779
around that world for so long I really

699
00:22:53,760 --> 00:23:00,179
kind of fell into a trap of always being

700
00:22:57,779 --> 00:23:02,159
someone that was kept like the secret

701
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:04,110
and when you are someone like me who is

702
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,460
you know I get asked all the time even

703
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:07,230
every day on my channel you guys I get

704
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:08,789
comments are you a guy are you a girl

705
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:10,980
are you transgender are you trying to

706
00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:14,940
transition what are you being someone

707
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:17,070
that is like me that is a guy that looks

708
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:18,930
like a woman right I keep doing this

709
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:20,460
because so many people are not into

710
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:22,440
labels these days and I love that I'm

711
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:23,700
all about that you do you call yourself

712
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,560
whatever you want whatever you believe

713
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,900
in I think that is the beauty and the

714
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:29,820
freedom of you know living is we can be

715
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:32,010
whoever we want to be I have always been

716
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:34,380
into straight men and the problem with

717
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:36,960
that my entire life is I never found

718
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:38,910
real love because straight men behind

719
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,590
closed doors they love people like me

720
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:41,250
they love hooking up they love having

721
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:43,590
fun

722
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:45,270
they love the relationship as long as

723
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:46,470
other people don't know I really like

724
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,610
the stuff from Jeffrey's video because

725
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:49,920
not only is everything in it very

726
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:51,510
accurate but I honestly feel like he did

727
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:53,400
a great job of explaining a topic that

728
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:55,380
is very confusing and complex and then

729
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:57,990
not a lot of people understand including

730
00:23:55,380 --> 00:24:00,090
me fully to be honest yes as a gay man I

731
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:01,590
am attracted to men and in the past

732
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:03,240
whenever I have found a guy cute on

733
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:04,980
Instagram or on social media I have

734
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:07,320
stood in the dm's of the simple hello or

735
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:08,880
a nice compliment if anybody ever made

736
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,950
it clear that they were not interested

737
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,720
or were not gay and didn't want to talk

738
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:15,210
I always apologized for the unwanted

739
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,820
attention and the conversation was put

740
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:19,020
to a halt immediately I do take full

741
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:20,550
responsibility for sending these

742
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:22,500
messages in this situation has

743
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:24,180
definitely taught me that sending

744
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,800
messages that are so for and direct like

745
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:27,780
this are unacceptable and I no longer

746
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:29,040
will do that moving forward a few

747
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,360
different guys that I've talked to in

748
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,430
the past have since came forward with

749
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:33,660
their stories or posted screenshots of

750
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,680
conversations that I had with them

751
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:36,360
saying that I made them feel

752
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:38,760
uncomfortable and reading some of them I

753
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:40,650
honestly felt really really bad I

754
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:43,530
reached out to all the boys directly and

755
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:45,780
apologize to them for my actions but

756
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:47,910
aside from those few guys people are

757
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:49,470
treating a hashtag Jam Chavez over party

758
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:51,270
as an open invitation to add to the

759
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:53,640
narrative with lies which is not only

760
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:56,400
harmful to me but it's also creating

761
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:58,860
very very dangerous stereotypes around

762
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,900
the lgbtq+ community for example zara

763
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:02,820
larsson who's a pretty big singer

764
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:05,520
tweeted saying that i messaged her

765
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:07,830
boyfriend multiple times knowing he was

766
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:10,290
straight and this tweak on almost half a

767
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:12,420
million likes before it was deleted in

768
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:13,950
her defense she did later on say there

769
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:15,420
was only one message but it was way too

770
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:16,440
late because the media had already ran

771
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,970
with it saying that I was harassing

772
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:20,040
straight men and wouldn't leave him

773
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:21,330
alone had I known that he was dating

774
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,130
zara larsson I clearly never would have

775
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:24,900
messaged him in the first place but this

776
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:27,270
is all very hypocritical considering and

777
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:28,830
this is how's our Larson found her

778
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:30,520
boyfriend I'd like to pose a question to

779
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:32,830
you the audience

780
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:34,750
why is it okay for zara larsson a woman

781
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:36,429
with the public platform to tweet these

782
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:38,410
photos of a shirtless man and say who

783
00:25:36,429 --> 00:25:40,090
are you where do you live how old are

784
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:42,490
you why are you so fine how do you like

785
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:44,800
your eggs cooked in the morning but for

786
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:46,600
me as a gay man to DM the same person in

787
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:49,059
private with a simple compliment is

788
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,890
predatory these stereotypes are on gay

789
00:25:49,059 --> 00:25:52,840
men had been and continue to be very

790
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:54,700
very harmful to the community and have

791
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:56,860
been historically used to villainize gay

792
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:59,650
men in society someone completely

793
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:01,570
fabricated a whole entire story about me

794
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:04,450
touching another boy at a high school

795
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:06,220
Journal and it blew up this person that

796
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:09,640
came forward a few days later saying

797
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:11,830
that it was a social experiment but it

798
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:13,780
was too late people also completely

799
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:15,700
photoshopped Twitter DMS of me reaching

800
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:17,530
out to these people threatening legal

801
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:19,210
action if they were to tweet more things

802
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:20,890
when in reality I have literally not

803
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:23,350
even met on social media and I deleted

804
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:25,510
the Twitter app from my phone so all

805
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:28,360
these things are just so false and are

806
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:29,830
so fake and it's truly disgusting

807
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,510
also pretty much every boy that I've

808
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:33,280
ever even communicated with at this

809
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:34,870
point is posting screenshots of our

810
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:37,059
conversation at to make a spectacle of

811
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:39,429
me I've dealt with so many fake stories

812
00:26:37,059 --> 00:26:41,620
in the past from Coachella the fake sex

813
00:26:39,429 --> 00:26:43,270
tape and now this and I'm done I'm done

814
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:46,240
being the subject of these bandwagon

815
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:47,290
stories for length it's not okay now

816
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,670
that we've addressed and cleared the air

817
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:50,980
on the boys let's get back to our

818
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:52,600
Thailand because somehow there's still a

819
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:55,179
whole lot more to this story and more

820
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:56,590
claims as well in toc2 video she said

821
00:26:55,179 --> 00:26:58,300
that she felt she needed to bring all

822
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:59,170
this to the public eye because people

823
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:01,929
need to just know what's going on behind

824
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:03,130
the scenes and I truly cannot believe

825
00:27:01,929 --> 00:27:05,230
that I'm about to bring up what I'm

826
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:07,660
going to bring up but I feel the same

827
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:09,490
exact way on Monday May sex that Jeffrey

828
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:11,620
posted this tweet to his twitter which i

829
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:13,120
honestly started getting tagged in after

830
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:14,650
this tweet and a few other ones from him

831
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,970
and his friends i decided to reach out

832
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:17,260
to him and asked if there was something

833
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:19,150
going on and that i should be aware of

834
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:20,290
he replied to me and he said that it was

835
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:22,240
not about me and that it was about

836
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:23,500
another brand stealing his ideas this

837
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,610
message was in a voice memo which has

838
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,800
since disappeared from the screenshot

839
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:28,179
you'll just have to believe me I have

840
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,650
literally no reason to lie at this point

841
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:31,420
even though he said it wasn't about me I

842
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:33,280
still asked to talk to him but he said

843
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:34,660
he was unavailable a few hours later

844
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,390
while I was getting ready to forth and

845
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:37,940
back down

846
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:40,850
this text from Jeffrey concerned but

847
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:42,080
mostly really really confused I reached

848
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:43,850
out to him about meeting together in

849
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,770
private and hopes to speak together and

850
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:46,460
figure out the best understanding but he

851
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:48,380
didn't reply

852
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:49,970
three days later still no response I

853
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:51,559
decided to reach out again but he was

854
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:53,480
not available to talk I flew to

855
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:55,010
Australia on May 8th and on May 10th

856
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,390
hours before my scheduled meeting

857
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:58,670
reappearance where five thousand fans

858
00:27:56,390 --> 00:28:00,080
were already waiting outside I was open

859
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:01,610
up at four in the morning by my friend

860
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,950
because Tonti had just uploaded a video

861
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:05,330
titled by a sister watching talk to his

862
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:07,220
video it was very clear to me that my

863
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:08,450
friend was still very hurt and even

864
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:11,000
though I had already apologized both

865
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:12,919
privately and publicly I wanted to make

866
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,200
a video right then and there with my raw

867
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:16,669
and honest emotions but because of the

868
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,500
time difference it took me the extra few

869
00:28:16,669 --> 00:28:20,090
hours to film the video and get it up

870
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,600
and by the time I was about to hit

871
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:22,760
publish

872
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:24,590
I received an another text from Jeffrey

873
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,490
star I've already cleared up Sam and our

874
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:28,580
nights together being a hundred percent

875
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:30,950
consensual he was absolutely not trapped

876
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:33,830
at a hotel room but Jeffrey also brings

877
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:36,320
up Zack Zack is his boyfriend Nate's

878
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:38,240
brother and not only did I not pursue

879
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,070
Zack who identifies his mainly straight

880
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,270
but it was actually Jeffrey who

881
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:43,190
suggested that I talk to him in the

882
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:45,860
first place maintenance brother is

883
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:53,510
single and mainly strange alright after

884
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:55,700
Ali moved here work Zack and I talked on

885
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:58,070
South chat for maybe a total of 10

886
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:59,299
selfies parking port to each other he

887
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,559
was super super sweet but it was very

888
00:28:59,299 --> 00:29:02,630
clear to me that he was not actually

889
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:04,580
interested and the conversation stopped

890
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:07,580
before anything could even get remotely

891
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:08,870
flirty at all with everything going on I

892
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:11,090
did not reply to Jeffrey's text in the

893
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:12,710
moment a few days later on Monday I woke

894
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:14,270
up again in the middle of the night from

895
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:17,360
a phone call my little brother Ian who

896
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:19,010
was very very upset he's only he had

897
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,390
tweeted saying why do people act so

898
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:22,309
tough online about somebody from his

899
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:25,100
hometown who was bullying him and a

900
00:29:22,309 --> 00:29:28,040
Jeffrey star of all people had quote

901
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:29,720
tweeted Ian's tweet saying why is her

902
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:32,299
brother a predator why don't you really

903
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:34,880
move back to New York City exactly shut

904
00:29:32,299 --> 00:29:37,010
the [ __ ] up many people were quick to

905
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,150
call out Jeffrey for bullying a kid who

906
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:40,790
had nothing to do with the situation

907
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:42,830
literally at all and he deleted it the

908
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:44,420
tweet after this I went to check my

909
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:46,429
and notice that Jeffrey had texted me a

910
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:48,679
few minutes prior and I opened my phone

911
00:29:46,429 --> 00:29:50,480
to this I really want to read this text

912
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:52,970
out loud just so you all get to hear

913
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,490
exactly what I had to read but also so I

914
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:57,050
don't miss anything

915
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:58,520
Grayson is going on camera shortly to

916
00:29:57,050 --> 00:30:00,830
finally tell the world how you tried to

917
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:03,050
molest him and touch him in his sleep

918
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:04,840
and made him uncomfortable for months

919
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:07,190
you sick [ __ ]

920
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:08,990
next Zach will be going on camera to

921
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:11,150
tell how twisted and sick you were

922
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:12,770
trying to get him to like you and then

923
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:15,890
make him feel bad what he didn't want to

924
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:18,200
send you photos back then Sam from

925
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:20,210
Seattle will be joining me in Cameron to

926
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,660
talk about you trapping him in his hotel

927
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:22,910
room

928
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:26,150
you need to be locked in prison for a

929
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:28,700
very long time you need the internet

930
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:31,910
taken away from you you are a danger to

931
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:33,470
society as disgusting as it is I have to

932
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:35,750
admit bringing up Graceland Dolan was

933
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:37,100
pretty clever at the height of all these

934
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:38,780
allegations and stories going around

935
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:40,520
both of the twins unfollowed me not

936
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:41,840
wanting to be associated and fans

937
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,760
started speculating that the rumors

938
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:46,390
could be as to why

939
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:48,470
too bad that aside from our pre-planned

940
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:49,730
collaborative jokes that happen did the

941
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:52,220
sisters want videos of me and Grayson

942
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:54,080
flirting nothing ever happened between

943
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:55,400
us and when all this went down

944
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,020
I knew Jeffrey was lying because the

945
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,970
twins were two of the first people to

946
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:00,740
call me and make sure that I was okay I

947
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:02,510
already mentioned Zach and I still have

948
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:04,280
no idea who the Cameron at Jeffrey's

949
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:06,020
referring to in this message is but he

950
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:07,940
also brought up Sam last who he also

951
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:10,010
already talked about later on that day

952
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:11,960
though Jeffrey was right Sam did upload

953
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:13,790
a video to his YouTube channel telling

954
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:15,650
the whole story he left out almost all

955
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:17,780
the details and included an illegally

956
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:20,120
recorded FaceTime call which was on May

957
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:22,400
2nd told you'd remember that but even

958
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:23,809
through all of this he still managed to

959
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:27,800
get the point across that our

960
00:31:23,809 --> 00:31:29,480
interactions were 100% consensual next

961
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:31,730
was Jeffrey's tweets my little brother

962
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:33,559
Ian now I did say that this video was

963
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:35,090
going to be solely based on facts and I

964
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:36,740
of course can't prove what Jeffrey was

965
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:38,870
trying to imply here and I don't want to

966
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:40,970
put words into his mouth but since it's

967
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:42,710
now open for speculation might as well

968
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:43,940
clear the air he had actually went home

969
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:45,830
for a few different reasons but it's

970
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:47,300
temporary he had to get his with some

971
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:48,830
teeth taken out and he's also working on

972
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:51,169
different modeling opportunities in New

973
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:51,650
York City and I am so incredibly proud

974
00:31:51,169 --> 00:31:53,360
of

975
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:55,610
but he was also having a really really

976
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,559
hard time in LA dealing with a public

977
00:31:55,610 --> 00:32:00,650
breakup and negativity online sent him

978
00:31:57,559 --> 00:32:02,030
into diagnosed clinical depression which

979
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:05,960
he is now being treated for and he

980
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:06,410
wanted to be with my parents nothing

981
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,150
more

982
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:10,250
last but finally not least Jeffrey

983
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:11,720
posted this tweet claiming he hadn't

984
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:14,780
seen me since February and that Nate

985
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:16,490
banned me from their home now this

986
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:18,320
so-called ban is the first time I'm ever

987
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:19,670
hearing of this and I just think it's

988
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,809
really funny that Jeffrey brought this

989
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:22,880
up could starting the fact that he's

990
00:32:20,809 --> 00:32:25,160
tweeted me twice and between February

991
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,170
and now saying that he missed me

992
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:28,730
regardless he ended that tweet first

993
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:31,429
thing I was a danger to society and

994
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:32,870
everything in takis video was 100% true

995
00:32:31,429 --> 00:32:34,850
adding insult to injury

996
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:36,590
not only did Jeffrey texted me but he

997
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:39,440
also went out of his way to text my best

998
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:40,820
friend drew this lovely message trying

999
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,320
to turn him against me Jeffrey's

1000
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:44,530
messaging about me both in private and

1001
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:47,480
in public was hurtful to fam'ly Torrey

1002
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:50,210
extremely excessive but most importantly

1003
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:52,670
literally all based on lies I wish I

1004
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:54,200
knew why he was doing all this but at

1005
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:56,660
the same time his track record with

1006
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:59,150
public views makes under this a surprise

1007
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:01,550
Totti made a video telling stories about

1008
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:02,870
me and publicly humiliating me and now I

1009
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:04,760
have serious allegations against me that

1010
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:06,830
could be detrimental to my career hello

1011
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:08,300
future games here popping in again I've

1012
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:10,250
been completely honest my whole timeline

1013
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:11,809
thus far and I obviously want to keep

1014
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:13,850
doing so so I feel like it is only fair

1015
00:33:11,809 --> 00:33:16,100
to mention that only within the past few

1016
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:17,630
days it pretty much everyone involved

1017
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:20,179
with this situation has started to reach

1018
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:22,250
out to me in some way shape or form

1019
00:33:20,179 --> 00:33:24,410
say I'm cook the boy from Seattle has

1020
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:25,520
called me nine times and sent me a few

1021
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:26,600
different text messages about the

1022
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,140
situation and trying to make things

1023
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:30,080
right

1024
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:31,850
Totti and her husband James have tried

1025
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,309
to reach out in order to schedule an

1026
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:36,500
meeting but only through a mutual

1027
00:33:33,309 --> 00:33:38,150
YouTube rep that we share and I'd also

1028
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:41,300
heard from that same person that Jeffrey

1029
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:43,970
was open to a meeting as well this whole

1030
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:45,679
thing has just been really difficult for

1031
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:48,290
me because throughout the past three

1032
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:50,450
weeks literally all I've wanted and all

1033
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:51,950
I asked for was for communication from

1034
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:56,270
these people and I tried really really

1035
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:58,190
hard to get that and I did it so I

1036
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:59,960
declined the meetings because I felt

1037
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:02,150
like this was started publicly and it

1038
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:03,130
was addressed publicly and I felt like

1039
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:04,990
it was only fair

1040
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:07,450
for me to address as publicly as well

1041
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:11,379
before meeting behind the scenes and

1042
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:14,800
talking further that sucks to say

1043
00:34:11,379 --> 00:34:17,679
because I still have love for these

1044
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,570
people and I hope that one day we all

1045
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,940
can sit down together in a meeting for

1046
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:24,010
closure and also to discuss how in the

1047
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:25,659
future if problems do come up we can

1048
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:28,659
talk in private

1049
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:30,610
with only us involved but right now I

1050
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:32,110
just need time and space to kind of get

1051
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:33,399
my head back to where it needs to be and

1052
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:35,590
get my mental health back together

1053
00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:37,600
before I kind of rekindle those

1054
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:41,550
friendships because everything that

1055
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:44,260
happens still really really hurt and I I

1056
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:46,990
like wouldn't wish what I went through

1057
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:49,840
upon even my worst enemy no matter how

1058
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:53,050
angry I was I've always tried to use my

1059
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:54,010
platform to spread positivity but I feel

1060
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:56,320
like at this point it's my

1061
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:59,500
responsibility to be honest with you

1062
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,850
guys and tell you that the last few

1063
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:04,120
weeks of my life has literally been the

1064
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:11,380
most painful time that I've ever had to

1065
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:15,070
deal with and my head and brain for a

1066
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:18,220
hot minute went to a place so dark that

1067
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:24,010
I didn't think that I was going to come

1068
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:26,760
back from and I thought I can't believe

1069
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:26,760
I just mitad that on camera

1070
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:38,090
people always say that being a

1071
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:39,350
social-media influencer is an easy job

1072
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:41,540
and this is some that I've talked about

1073
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:46,610
time and time to time to get on YouTube

1074
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:52,760
we get it but I don't think any human

1075
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:57,650
being ever is prepared mentally or

1076
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:59,180
physically to deal with the pain and

1077
00:35:57,650 --> 00:36:01,730
anxiety of what it feels like to have

1078
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:05,180
millions and millions of people talking

1079
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:07,460
to you at one time having to read the

1080
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:10,550
hundreds of thousands of tweets and the

1081
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:16,250
YouTube videos and the articles about me

1082
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:23,960
and my character and my family based on

1083
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:26,120
things that were almost all lies like it

1084
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:29,860
messed me up it messed me up

1085
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:29,860
is the best way that I can put it and

1086
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:36,170
through all of this I've learned that if

1087
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,800
I can get through this I can get through

1088
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:38,780
anything

1089
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:41,480
joy getting in on bandwagon hate and

1090
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:43,700
cancel culture is incredibly incredibly

1091
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:45,890
toxic and it's very concerning to me

1092
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:47,500
that as a society we're becoming okay

1093
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:51,050
with guilty until proven innocent

1094
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:52,430
instead of the other way around I truly

1095
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:55,130
hope that everyone who participated in

1096
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:57,920
this whether it be fans influencers Java

1097
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:59,480
channels or credible newest sources take

1098
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,800
the time to think about your words and

1099
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,600
the impact that they may have on others

1100
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,550
because I assure you and I promise you

1101
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:06,620
it's a lot stronger than you might you

1102
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:08,030
may think right now I have a lot of

1103
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:10,130
positive changes that I want to work on

1104
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:12,320
in my life first and foremost I really

1105
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:13,790
want to focus more on spending time in

1106
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,710
person with the people that I love and

1107
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:17,240
care about the absolute most and I also

1108
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:18,470
have a lot of work to do in terms of

1109
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:20,060
getting my mental health box where it

1110
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:21,950
needs to be what's now when you guys

1111
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:23,630

1112
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:25,280

birthday next week

00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:37,310
I'm turning 20 gross many of you guys

1119
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:40,190
noticed that the Socialists apparel

1120
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:41,000
website was down I was so excited about

1121
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:43,100
a lot of the things that

1122
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,870
not coming very very soon and just the

1123
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:46,610
lion in general I am so grateful for all

1124
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:48,800
of your guys's love and support on it it

1125
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:50,540
was really really fun to work on I also

1126
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,580
love the team that I worked on it with

1127
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:54,680
but unfortunately I had a sever ties

1128
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:56,000
with Killer mercs I just don't see a

1129
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:58,250
world that exists where I could ever be

1130
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,710
in business with the team ran by someone

1131
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:02,060
like Geoffrey star if you placed an

1132
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:03,770
order on the website before it went down

1133
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:05,450
everything will still be fulfilled don't

1134
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:07,160
worry you'll get your items and if you

1135
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:09,470
got a gift card beforehand make sure you

1136
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:11,210
hold on to it because the balance will

1137
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:12,740
be valid whenever we reopen because we

1138
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:14,510
are coming back I promise

1139
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:16,180
in regards to the sisters tour which

1140
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:18,500
have gone quite a lot of questions about

1141
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:21,230
despite the ticket scandal we are almost

1142
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:23,210
completely sold out nationwide and that

1143
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:25,520
is mind blowing to me and I'm so

1144
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:27,890
grateful I know there's been a lot of

1145
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:30,290
emails and speculation as of right now I

1146
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:32,210
unfortunately do not have a full answer

1147
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:33,620
on what is happening with the tour but I

1148
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:36,800
will have an update for you guys by the

1149
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:39,290
end of this week I promise going on tour

1150
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:43,010
has been a dream of mine for so long now

1151
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:45,530
and I really want this to happen I just

1152
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:48,050
feel like meeting you guys hugging you

1153
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:50,080
and just getting to thank you

1154
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:53,990
face-to-face for what you've done for me

1155
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:56,150
is exactly what I need in my heart right

1156
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:58,700
now but at the same time towards a lot

1157
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:59,390
and it's a big big commitment and I want

1158
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,950
to make sure that I know what I'm

1159
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:03,560
getting into and that when I walk on

1160
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:04,970
stage every night it's with a genuine

1161
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:07,640
smile and you guys can feel that and

1162
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:09,200
you're able to smile as well so I'll

1163
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,550
keep you posted as for my youtube

1164
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,900
channel I decided that I'm gonna be

1165
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:14,510
taking some much-needed time away from

1166
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:16,040
content production on my last few videos

1167
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:17,960
I've definitely noticed quite a lot of

1168
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:19,610
comments talking about my ego or my

1169
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:23,120
attitude getting the best of me and

1170
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:24,740
getting to my head and I appreciate the

1171
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:27,020
constructive criticism and feedback and

1172
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:28,010
after a lot of reflection I think you're

1173
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:31,400
right

1174
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:33,980
I've lost focus and that sucks so much

1175
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:35,720
but I want to get back to it so badly

1176
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:38,180
and I want to get back to my original

1177
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:40,810
goal when I have no motivation other

1178
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:43,670
than just creating original content and

1179
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:45,200
that'll happen for sure and I already

1180
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:46,610
have some great ideas in the works but

1181
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,740
it's just gonna take a little bit of

1182
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:50,510
time ask my other social videos I pledge

1183
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:52,790
to myself that I'm going to try to power

1184
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:54,770
down as much as I can I'm sure I'll be

1185
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:55,970
checking here and there of course but I

1186
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:57,830
do really want to focus more on

1187
00:39:55,970 --> 00:40:00,110
in-person time and the people around me

1188
00:39:57,830 --> 00:40:01,970
that are loving and caring and that

1189
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:04,040
includes all of you guys whenever I do

1190
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:05,510
come back I don't know what it is but I

1191
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:08,540
just cannot wait to show you guys a

1192
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:10,820
better person with me I want to end this

1193
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:14,270
video today with two things an apology

1194
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:15,920
and a thank you to my sisters I'm sorry

1195
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:17,450
if I disappointed you and I'm really

1196
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,180
starting how to watch all this go down

1197
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:21,590
you saw a side of me that I'm really not

1198
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:24,080
proud of and that I know I need to work

1199
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:25,670
on changing and trust me I will be I

1200
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:28,880
recognize the fact that I haven't always

1201
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:33,110
been the best role model and that sucks

1202
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:36,290
I've tried but I will try way harder but

1203
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:38,750

00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:44,180

does not go unnoticed and you guys

1212
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:57,050

reached out to me in private to make

1217
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,720
sure I was okay during all of this when

1218
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,770
I felt like the entire world hated me it

1219
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,060
was really comforting to know that there

1220
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:13,730
were other people that understood the

1221
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:16,730
situation that were willing to show

1222
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:18,980
their love I know who you are you know

1223
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:20,660
who you are and one day I'll make sure

1224
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:26,120
that all of you guys know who they are

1225
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:27,920

1226
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:30,020
this point thank you for watching if you

1227
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,010
meet all the way to the end and in the

1228
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:35,770
spirit of turning something negative

1229
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:35,770
into a positive my sister
