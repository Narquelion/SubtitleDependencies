wanting some my favorite youtubers that

17
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:29,189
I know and love and respect I quickly

18
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,840
realized that I sometimes tend to skip

19
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:32,009
over a lot of the information and tips

20
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,020
that would be helpful to a beginner

21
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:35,130
makeup artist and a lot of my tutorials

22
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,920
are missing the content that actually

23
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:39,360
makes them tutorials I definitely always

24
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,280
love to kick my videos up a few notches

25
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,899

Instagram I feel like in my head you

31
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:54,809
guys are like way up here in the makeup

32
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,250
world but I do have to remember that

33
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:57,960
there are so many sisters out there as

34
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,010
well that don't have a million makeup

35
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,510
products and don't have a million

36
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,640
different brushes and don't spend hours

37
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,229
every single day beating their faces so

38
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,210
for today's video we're taking it back

39
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:07,260
to the basics back to the beginning and

40
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:09,930
I'm gonna be doing my makeup routine

41
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:12,240
while answering all of the most popular

42
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:14,460
Beauty questions everything from how to

43
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,990
avoid having cakey foundation how to

44
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,790
have a blinding highly and how to put on

45
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:19,860
lashes without stabbing my eyes out so

46
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,450
without further ado if you want to learn

47
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,530
a little bit more about your everyday of

48
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,800
make our routine and just how to look

49
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:28,940
flawless and beautiful let's get started

50
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,940
[Music]

51
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:32,400
so the whole even though not any makeup

52
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,720
products today you guys are the first

53
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,820
step to a makeup routine is usually

54
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,159
priming and the number one question that

55
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,960
I get when it comes to makeup is how do

56
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,930
I put on my makeup without looking at

57
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,009
cakey and texture and gross I'm gonna

58
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,869
talk about primers in a few short

59
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:47,759
seconds but the one step that is

60
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:49,890
absolutely vital to any good makeup

61
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,270
routine is skin care and the way I

62
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,130
always like to prep my skin before

63
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,500
putting on makeup or before videos is

64
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:56,310
with a moisturizer I'm probably gonna

65
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,469
blow your mind right now

66
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,880
well maybe not hopefully you guys are a

67
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:01,229
whole lot smarter than I was when I

68
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,909
first started doing makeup but you never

69
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:07,099
know I certainly do not know

70
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:09,780
oily skin is not the same thing as

71
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:12,090
hydrated skin no matter what your skin

72
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,900
type is even if you were dripping bodily

73
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,879
oils by the

74
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,500
of the day you know but I can really on

75
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,540
a spiritual level you should be

76
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,920
moisturizing your skin it very very well

77
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:22,799
before starting your makeup routine

78
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,760
popping water and your face is really

79
00:02:22,799 --> 00:02:25,140
really important while you're doing

80
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,360
makeup because after putting on a

81
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,920
million pounds of foundation powder at

82
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,439
settings bright highlighter like the

83
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,150
whole shebang it really does kind of

84
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:34,530
suck the life out of your skin so having

85
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:36,090
a good moisturizer kind of underneath

86
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:38,040
everything to really keep everything

87
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:40,409
hydrated and locked in place is very

88
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,489
very vital I personally love the touch

89
00:02:40,409 --> 00:02:44,489
of water cream this is my all-time

90
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:46,170
favorite but I will say it is very very

91
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:47,549
very expensive and definitely not like

92
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:49,500
an affordable product for everybody out

93
00:02:47,549 --> 00:02:51,450
there I would just say find a good

94
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,889
dermatologist recommended a moisturizer

95
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:54,510
that's gonna work best for you and your

96
00:02:52,889 --> 00:02:56,190
skin type but no matter what your skin

97
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:58,620
type is I would definitely recommend a

98
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:59,879
good water gel moisturizer and I really

99
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,409
just make everything going up much much

100
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:03,450
smoother and preserve the life of your

101
00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:05,400
face and your makeup I'm just going to

102
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:07,859
go into my knuckle and grab a little bit

103
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,319
on there and just play some dollops all

104
00:03:07,859 --> 00:03:12,209
over my face I did wash my hands before

105
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:15,359
starting to film this video and I'm just

106
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:16,739
going to rub this all over the next step

107
00:03:15,359 --> 00:03:17,849
is going to be a primer and for today's

108
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:19,709
video I'm gonna talk about the benefit

109
00:03:17,849 --> 00:03:21,569
Porefessional primer I don't really use

110
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:23,340
primers that often but when I do I

111
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:24,840
always reach for this one it is one my

112
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,599
all-time favorites and this is a

113
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,489
silicone based primer obviously it's

114
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,810
called it professional so because of the

115
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:32,669
silicone this is going to act as kind of

116
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,349
a barrier between the moisturizer that

117
00:03:32,669 --> 00:03:36,299
you just put on your skin and all the

118
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:38,459
makeup which both protects your skin and

119
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:41,099
the silicone will kind of fill in your

120
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:43,769
pores I'm just gonna grab a little pea

121
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:45,299
sized dollop I'm gonna place this primer

122
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:47,040
in the areas that I have most skin

123
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:48,750
texture and pores and that is going to

124
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,310
be kind of right here on the cheek

125
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:52,769
region right in the middle of the

126
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:55,409
forehead and on the chin what I'm not

127
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:57,510
gonna do is put it on the nose and I'll

128
00:03:55,409 --> 00:04:00,510
get to why in a few short seconds you

129
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:03,479
guys know I live live live live for a

130
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:05,220
good sister nose snot I love a contra my

131
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:06,870
nose is probably what my favorite stabs

132
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,220
on my entire makeup routine we're gonna

133
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:10,199
get into contouring later on in the

134
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:12,720
video but one question that I get asked

135
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:14,970
all the time is how do I get my

136
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,530
foundation to stay on my nose and I'm

137
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:18,359
suing this is probably or lease can

138
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:19,829
people who are asking this question and

139
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:22,650
this is actually something that I used

140
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:24,510
to struggle with all the time but I do

141
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:25,740
have one little hack for you guys and

142
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,400
has really saved the life of my nose

143
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,050
contour

144
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,970
when my skin is more oily and giving me

145
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:31,110
a lot of issues basically what we're

146
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,270
gonna do here is what I like to call a

147
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:34,830
priming at the nose that is why I did

148
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:36,330
not put any actual primer on my nose

149
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:38,220
because I feel like a lot of times

150
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:39,479
primer on the nose makes everything kind

151
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,120
of slip and slide around which is

152
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:43,949
obviously the opposite of the goal so

153
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,680
I'm gonna grab a really really

154
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:48,539
full-coverage heavy-duty concealer I

155
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,400
would normally use like a Mac Paint Pot

156
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:51,539
or a benefit kind of boying concealer

157
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,820
just something very very creamy and

158
00:04:51,539 --> 00:04:55,800
heavy I accidently cannot find either

159
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:58,020
one of those today so I'm gonna grab my

160
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,539
iconic London a contouring palette these

161
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:02,370
are just cream contour shades and I'm

162
00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:06,000
gonna grab it like probably this shade

163
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:08,669
right here with a more packing brush and

164
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,760
what I'm gonna do is literally just go

165
00:05:08,669 --> 00:05:13,020
all over my nose and really pack this in

166
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,720
I know this might look absolutely

167
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:17,190
ridiculous and crazy please do not do

168
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,470
this if you're going for a light

169
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:21,599
coverage everyday makeup look this is

170
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:24,180
for intense makeup people you will look

171
00:05:21,599 --> 00:05:26,940
absolutely ridiculous with this odd but

172
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:28,800
I know this looks crazy right now but

173
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,240
adding this first layer of concealer all

174
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,699
around the nose region is really gonna

175
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,830
add like a layer of reinforcement when

176
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:36,990
it comes to the foundation later on so

177
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:39,330
if the foundation that kind of wears off

178
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:41,220
throughout the day and aware off to at

179
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:42,539
the concealer underneath another

180
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,070
question I get all the time too when it

181
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:46,349
comes to nose is if you are a glasses

182
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:47,789
where is how to avoid getting those two

183
00:05:46,349 --> 00:05:49,860
little circles on the sides of your nose

184
00:05:47,789 --> 00:05:52,409
and messing up your makeup you don't

185
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,729
that is why I wear contacts so the next

186
00:05:52,409 --> 00:05:54,930
type is going to be a foundation and for

187
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:56,250
today's video I'm gonna be using the Too

188
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:58,050
Faced Born This Way Foundation

189
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:00,000
I am personally in the shade nude I

190
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:01,710
really really love the formula this I

191
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,479
think it was very very beautifully on my

192
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:04,800
skin at least obviously everybody's

193
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:06,150
foundation routine is gonna be a little

194
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,560
bit different but the one thing I would

195
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:09,300
like to point out about this is before

196
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,270
actually putting it on is that this is a

197
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:14,729
silicone based foundation just like our

198
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:16,139
silicone based primer all the

199
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:17,669
ingredients for all makeup products are

200
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:19,590
always listed on like Sephora and Ulta

201
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:20,909
and if you are someone who is kind of

202
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:22,199
having trouble with your makeup routine

203
00:06:20,909 --> 00:06:23,820
you definitely want to look at the

204
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:25,710
ingredients you don't want to mix a

205
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:28,050
water-based primer with a silicone based

206
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:30,380
foundation or vice versa because that's

207
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:32,400
gonna cause kind of like a chemical

208
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:34,590
problem that is gonna make your makeup

209
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,909
separate and streaky and obviously if we

210
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:36,950
don't want that so make sure your

211
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:38,600
ingredients match up

212
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,770
nicely and complement each other I'm

213
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,120
gonna be applying the foundation to my

214
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:42,440
face that are using a damp Beauty

215
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,030
Blender all I did was want this under

216
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,000
the sink in hot water and then wring it

217
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:49,340
out really really well I personally

218
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,650
really really love how sponges apply a

219
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:54,230
foundation to the face and I much prefer

220
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:55,790
a sponge over a brush I know one thing

221
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:57,680
that you guys ask me all the time is

222
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:59,780
that you love my full coverage looks but

223
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,310
you just simply cannot rock that much

224
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:03,260
makeup on your face and I definitely do

225
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:04,610
not blame you wearing this full coverage

226
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:07,190
and intense makeup is definitely a

227
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:09,980
choice to say the least so I definitely

228
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:11,330
really really love bun jizz over brushes

229
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,890
for applying foundation because it does

230
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:14,750
soak up a little bit of the product and

231
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:17,150
kind of really pushes it into the skin

232
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:18,860
which gives a much more natural skin

233
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:20,690
like appearance rather than a brush that

234
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:22,640
just kind of like pushes it all around

235
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:25,790
and oftentimes gives you a blending

236
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:27,320
issues as well sponges all the way 100%

237
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:28,970
another question that I get asked all

238
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,800
the time about foundation application is

239
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:33,350
how do I find the right foundation for

240
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,320
my skin tone and although I might not be

241
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:38,750
the best person to ask for that we all

242
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:40,580
know why there is one little like hack

243
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:43,730
or trick that I learned that literally

244
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:45,770
changed my makeup game forever and I'll

245
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:49,130
forever be thankful for it and that is

246
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:52,670
never ever look at foundation swatches

247
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:54,980
in a makeup store literally ever let's

248
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:56,330
be real we have all had situations where

249
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,680
we've tried on a new foundation or

250
00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:00,530
concealer in a makeup store and it

251
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,570
looked so good like perfect match right

252
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:03,860
in the store when you buy it and then

253
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:05,570
you go home after spending your

254
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,490
hard-earned coins on that product you

255
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:10,280
put it on and the color is nowhere even

256
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:11,750
near close to your skin tone the

257
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,370
lighting of those sources purposely dim

258
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:15,530
and soft which gives your skin a very

259
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:17,930
blurred like effect and it's also very

260
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:19,040
warm lighting which tends to make a lot

261
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,870
of different makeup products look like

262
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,220
they're in the same exact color my best

263
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:24,140
recommendation for you if you're in the

264
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:25,730
market for a new complexion product will

265
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:28,640
be go to the makeup stores prepared

266
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:30,500
bring a little compact mirror with you

267
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,450
and use that to see the colors of your

268
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,770
foundation do not use your phone camera

269
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:35,599
because it will not give you the same

270
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:38,150
effect but find a few different

271
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,650
foundations that are all kind of close

272
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:42,050
to what you think your skin tone may be

273
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:43,460
and then swatch them all on your face

274
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:45,160
right next to each other and make sure

275
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:47,079
you remember what order they are in

276
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,790
and then once they're all swatched walk

277
00:08:47,079 --> 00:08:50,980
out of Sephora

278
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:52,779
get out get out of that lighting walk

279
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,250
outside obviously do not steal at

280
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:56,440
foundations and then pull out your

281
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:58,810
compact mirror and kind of look and once

282
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,190
you're in the natural daylight then you

283
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:01,720
make your decision on what shade do you

284
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:03,579
think will match you best and I promise

285
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,500
you will have so much better results

286
00:09:03,579 --> 00:09:07,000
this way because there is no wonky

287
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,740
lighting to get in your way

288
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,089
our next up is going to be a concealer

289
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:12,310
so I'm just going to apply this like

290
00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:13,509
normal right in my under eyes and on the

291
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:15,579
center of my face to kind of brighten

292
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:16,870
everything up and the most popular

293
00:09:15,579 --> 00:09:18,699
question that I got with concealer is

294
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:21,579
how do I set it in place and make sure

295
00:09:18,699 --> 00:09:22,689
it doesn't look cakey and Creasy the

296
00:09:21,579 --> 00:09:23,860
shape here concealers are my all-time

297
00:09:22,689 --> 00:09:26,199
favorites because it's full coverage

298
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:28,509
blends out easily but feels a very very

299
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:30,879
light on the skin I will say though it

300
00:09:28,509 --> 00:09:33,009
is drying I have oily skin so this works

301
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:34,839
perfectly fine for me but if you have

302
00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:36,759
dry skin a concealer like this is gonna

303
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:38,199
be your absolute worst nightmare and

304
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:39,639
that's why it's so important to do

305
00:09:38,199 --> 00:09:41,709
research on the different formulations

306
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:43,870
or products before hand a really great

307
00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:45,850
alternative that I love for what I'm

308
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:48,459
having a drier skin days is the Becca

309
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:49,810
aqua luminous concealer it is a kind of

310
00:09:48,459 --> 00:09:52,180
medium coverage but it blends out

311
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:54,100
beautifully has a very very hydrating

312
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:55,630
type of formula to it I absolutely love

313
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,310
that for doing dewy looks or also if I'm

314
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:59,259
wearing no makeup at all and just want

315
00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:00,910
to conceal a few pimples it is really

316
00:09:59,259 --> 00:10:02,050
really great before we go in and blend

317
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:03,399
out my under eyes to get rid of the

318
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:05,589
creases I'm gonna have my setting powder

319
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:07,689
at there ready my personal favorite is

320
00:10:05,589 --> 00:10:08,949
actually a mixture of the Laura Mercier

321
00:10:07,689 --> 00:10:11,230
translucent setting powder and the Too

322
00:10:08,949 --> 00:10:13,120
Faced sweet peach setting powder ooh

323
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:14,439
that's a mouthful I discovered this in

324
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,970
my mixing my setting powders video and

325
00:10:14,439 --> 00:10:17,980
I've been using it ever since but you

326
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:19,720
can obviously use whatever you have I'm

327
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:21,430
just gonna go to the pointy end of my

328
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:24,670
damp Beauty Blender and just kind of

329
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:27,040
push those creases up being sure not to

330
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:29,110
be too harsh and then with that same

331
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,240
exact Beauty Blender still damp I'm

332
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:32,860
gonna dip it right into that powder and

333
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,980
I'm just gonna push this right

334
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:37,569
underneath the eye using a damp Beauty

335
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:39,699
sponge to press powder into the face as

336
00:10:37,569 --> 00:10:41,139
opposed to a brush or a powder puff was

337
00:10:39,699 --> 00:10:42,579
honestly probably one of my favorite

338
00:10:41,139 --> 00:10:45,009
makeup tricks that I have ever learned

339
00:10:42,579 --> 00:10:45,639
today and truly change my makeup game

340
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:47,559
forever

341
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:49,329
swear to God on that it obviously

342
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:50,860
presses the powder into the skin which

343
00:10:49,329 --> 00:10:53,019
modifies and says everything in place

344
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:55,149
but because the Beauty Blender is still

345
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:56,949
slightly damp it kind of melts the

346
00:10:55,149 --> 00:10:57,810
powder into the skin as well which

347
00:10:56,949 --> 00:11:00,360
really

348
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:01,860
helps when it comes to skin texture the

349
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,510
ones like Kanta this technique I will

350
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,610
say as if you were like me and you had

351
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:08,670
very very oily skin and you tend to talk

352
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:10,410
with a lot of expression throughout the

353
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:11,790
day since you're not like packing it on

354
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:13,950
you're kind of more melting it into the

355
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:15,390
face your smile lines and your forehead

356
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:17,490
lines might start to peak through a

357
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:19,380
little bit but I would much rather have

358
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:21,029
a beautiful smooth skin with a few lines

359
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:23,279
that mean I talk a lot and I'm very very

360
00:11:21,029 --> 00:11:25,860
happy then to have it very very crusty a

361
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:27,300
powdery skin texture it's obviously a

362
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:29,400
pro/con situation that you can weigh out

363
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,330
in your own mind but I love this

364
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,130
technique and would definitely recommend

365
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:33,600
now that I face it's all powdered and

366
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:35,520
set in place next obviously comes

367
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,620
sculpting a contouring blush bronzer

368
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,940
highlighter the whole shebang but

369
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,800
there's one thing that I want to do

370
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:43,020
before that and that is it give my face

371
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,810
a good spread of mac fix+

372
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:46,350
with my good and trusted sister fan at

373
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:47,700
the ready

374
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:49,529
throughout my makeup routine especially

375
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,390
after using a lot of powder I really

376
00:11:49,529 --> 00:11:53,400
like to go in it with a light spritz of

377
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:55,080
mac's fix+

378
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,580
I feel like this really does a good job

379
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,529
of kind of melting all the powders into

380
00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:00,450
the skin and once again eliminating that

381
00:11:58,529 --> 00:12:02,460
cakiness and then I just run my fan and

382
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:03,960
make sure to dry it right off before

383
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:06,030
moving to the next step because as much

384
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,890
as I do love a wet and dewy base

385
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:10,110
obviously having a wet face is gonna

386
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:11,490
mess up any powder products later on

387
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:13,589
now that our base is done and we are

388
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:14,790
looking even we have to contour because

389
00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:17,070
as good as our skin looks right now

390
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:19,680
we're looking a little bit Flat Stanley

391
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:22,680
like so to do that we're going to use

392
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,089
contour and a bronzer which are not the

393
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,890
same thing to contour today I'm gonna

394
00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:27,300
use my Kat Von D shade know like contour

395
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:29,280
palette I really really love the

396
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:32,130
formulas and the colors and I'm gonna

397
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:34,200
use my morphe M 405 brush this is like a

398
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:35,820
medium sized fluffy taper and a

399
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,710
contouring brush and really allows you

400
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:40,050
to get right in on that cheekbone but

401
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:42,300
before I contour I'm actually gonna go

402
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:44,970
in and I'm going to bronze my face using

403
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:47,760
my benefit hoola bronzer and my morphe M

404
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:49,890
5 to 7 brush this is a very very big

405
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,930
fluffy brush which allows us to get all

406
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:54,000
over color but I'm just going to dip it

407
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:55,830
right in tap it off because you don't

408
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,560
want too much on there but then I'm

409
00:12:55,830 --> 00:13:01,709
gonna go in right on the cheekbone and

410
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,120
kind of place that powder on there I'm

411
00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:04,589
also gonna follow that bronze are up and

412
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,530
bring it onto the sides of my face and

413
00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:10,560
on my forehead as well kind of all over

414
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:12,779
the place the point of bronzer is not to

415
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:15,300
sculpture face it is to give a very very

416
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:16,980
beautiful bronze glow I really want this

417
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:18,270
to give a nice sunkissed type of look

418
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:20,430
that we were laying out and got a nice

419
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:22,770
tan if you're like me and you lay out in

420
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:24,180
tan you just get burned so bronzer is a

421
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:26,220
really really great alternative to that

422
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:28,290
and this also provides kind of like a

423
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:30,240
transition color in between our natural

424
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:32,610
skin tone and the contours that are

425
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,990
about to put on next we just bronze

426
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:35,880
which brought a lot more color and

427
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:37,680
dimension to our face but now we want to

428
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,660
contour and the whole point of contour

429
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,040
is to kind of sculpt your face out going

430
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:42,660
right in on your different bone

431
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,700
structure to really enhance her natural

432
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:46,350
features our bronzer was obviously a

433
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,339
warm tone shade so now I'm gonna grab

434
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:49,710
that angle brush that I was talking

435
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:53,130
about before and dip into mostly this

436
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:55,589
shade but just a slight tiny bit of this

437
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:57,330
one top it off and I'm gonna be much

438
00:13:55,589 --> 00:13:59,970
more precise with the placement of my

439
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:01,920
brush and that is contouring I'm gonna

440
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:03,839
imagine that there's a line right here

441
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,610
from the top of my ear down to the

442
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,650
corner of my mouth and I'm gonna place

443
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:09,990
my brush right here and focus the most

444
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:11,339
amount of color right here we really

445
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:13,710
want to make sure we're blending upwards

446
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:14,910
as opposed to downwards because of

447
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:17,490
blending downwards is gonna give us like

448
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:19,170
a very very sunken Angelina Jolie type

449
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:20,970
look which also is definitely good for

450
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:22,350
like more Halloween types up or if

451
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:24,540
you're going for a more masculine type

452
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:26,460
of contour which is totally okay too but

453
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:28,020
I like to blend upwards with give your

454
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:30,270
cheeks are very very lifted and a

455
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:32,100
beautiful look once again holding the

456
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:33,600
brush level to my face placing it right

457
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,010
in my natural cheek bone and just

458
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,839
blending out lightly downwards towards

459
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:38,460
the corner my mouth and as you can see

460
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:41,640
this gives a really nice job of having

461
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:44,370
an even kind of ombre situation from the

462
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:46,710
contour to the bronzer to the concealer

463
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:48,150
we put on so it's like a nice fade and

464
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:50,400
this gives us a very very rounded and

465
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:51,600
lifted look like I said the whole point

466
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,160
of how the day of contouring is to

467
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,570
sculpt the face so highlighting is

468
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,010
obviously going to bring whatever you're

469
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:57,630
kind of featuring a forward and

470
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:59,490
contouring is going to kind of pull it

471
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:01,950
back and hide it a little bit so if

472
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:03,150
you're like me and you have a lot on

473
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:05,580
your mind at all times

474
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:07,500
team 5head present I'm also going to use

475
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:09,180
a little bit of that contour to kind of

476
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:12,120
chisel out my hairline a little bit and

477
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:13,470
fake it as if it was a little bit lower

478
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,140
I'm also gonna take this powder and run

479
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:17,850
it right underneath my jaw line this

480
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:19,560
shadow plus of course a little bit of

481
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:21,390
facetune it's really gonna trick the eye

482
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,540
into thinking that my jaw line is a lot

483
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:24,670
more defined

484
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:26,110
it really is the most common question I

485
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:27,400
get when it comes to nose contour is how

486
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:29,530
do I make my nose look really really

487
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:32,620
snatched and tiny just like sister James

488
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:33,670
is well first of all face tune really

489
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:35,110
gonna save your life here because

490
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:37,360
sometimes in certain lighting nose

491
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:38,560
contour doesn't look too fast but if you

492
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,820
don't you gonna be taking a selfie with

493
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,950
good lighting or if you're in natural

494
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:44,260
daily a good nose contour can really

495
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:46,180
change your entire face of makeup for

496
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:47,350
the better if you're like me I'm gonna

497
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,970
take the contour powder on the fluffy

498
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:51,460
under this brush and start by blending

499
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:53,920
in two lines I'm kind of the top of my

500
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:55,060
nose on top of the bridge if you're

501
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,110
someone like me you're trying to kind of

502
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:58,210
fool the eye into thinking that your

503
00:15:56,110 --> 00:16:00,130
nose looks a lot smaller you definitely

504
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:02,020
do not want to follow your natural no

505
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:03,220
shape in the situation and you kind of

506
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,840
want to place the contours where you

507
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,260
wish your nose looks like in the first

508
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,150
place

509
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:08,860
so for me I'm placing this on the top of

510
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:10,990
the bridge and the closer you put the

511
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:12,910
two lines together the more tiny and

512
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:14,560
pinched your nose is gonna look versus

513
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:15,970
if you put them super far apart like

514
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,530
this picture of me from Halloween from

515
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:19,840
two years ago your nose which is gonna

516
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:20,980
look really really huge make you should

517
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,960
have blend in the contour very very

518
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,160
lightly because you guys know my nose is

519
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:26,110
definitely a problems not when it comes

520
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,340
to foundation rubbing off but if you

521
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,630
follow all the tips that I was talking

522
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:30,550
about you should be fine and your nose

523
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:31,990
contour would look snatched all day long

524
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:33,640
I'm just gonna plant a light layer of

525
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:35,320
blush right on up the tops of my

526
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:37,330
cheekbones making sure to not put too

527
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,680
much on a light wash of color can look

528
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:40,240
I'm very very beautiful but obviously if

529
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,950
you put too much you can look like a

530
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,570
circus clown and that is never the goal

531
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:45,160
a lot of people in their makeup routine

532
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:47,290
tend up a highlighter very very close at

533
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,610
the end of the routine or even last but

534
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:49,960
for me personally I've recently been

535
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:51,760
doing it right now

536
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:53,830
highlighter goes on best when there's

537
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,420
little product underneath and the more

538
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:57,310
power you pack onto your face throughout

539
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:58,510
your makeup routine the last the holiday

540
00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:00,880
is going to stick and the less it's

541
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:02,080
gonna shot so once again I'm gonna grab

542
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,270
my mac fix+

543
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,500
and I'm gonna give my face a light

544
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:07,750
spritz pause up

545
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:09,100
water rubbing a wet base is gonna make

546
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:11,020
the highlighter stick on it very very

547
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:12,340
nicely and we're gonna grab my Anasazi

548
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:15,330
oh so Hollywood you guys know that this

549
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:17,950
is my all-time favorite but my morphe M

550
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:19,480
501 brush I'm gonna dip it right into

551
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:21,310
the highlighter making sure to get a lot

552
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:24,190
on the brush and I'm also gonna spritz

553
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:26,050
that brush lightly as well to really

554
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:27,130
make sure it is super super metallic and

555
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:29,770
then they're just in the place this

556
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:33,130
shade right on the top of my cheekbone

557
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:34,900
and you can see already how binding that

558
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:37,059
is oh litter

559
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:39,220
so pretty oh my god you just see how

560
00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:41,050
like flawless this looks like I said you

561
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:42,340
obviously do not need to do this but we

562
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:44,200
are going to be applying a more powder

563
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:46,030
and more products to the face so I just

564
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,280
really like adding this layer of glow to

565
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:49,870
kind of reinforce it later on while the

566
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,370
face is still really really fresh and

567
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:52,750
kind of dewy because it just makes

568
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:55,030
everything look so much brighter and so

569
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:56,650
much more beautiful just trust me on

570
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:58,030
this one side note as well before I

571
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:59,860
forget and move on when it comes to

572
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:01,480
highlighting your nose instead of using

573
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:03,550
the same brush like the m500 will that

574
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,230
use on your cheeks grab a pencil brush

575
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:07,600
or a really tiny brush like this one

576
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:10,090
this is the morphe m-43 one and has a

577
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,429
pointed tip use obviously the same exact

578
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:15,250
highlighter but using a more defined

579
00:18:12,429 --> 00:18:17,410
brush for your nose highlight is going

580
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:20,140
to really keep that illusion going and

581
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:21,550
reinforce just the contour because if

582
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,870
you put the highlight all over its gonna

583
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:25,300
completely ruin the effect of the

584
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:27,220
pinched nose but if you put it just on

585
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:29,020
the tiniest tip of the nose Ridge right

586
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:30,550
in between those two contour lines it's

587
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:31,900
really gonna further the illusion and

588
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:34,809
make it look like your nose bridge is

589
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:36,700
literally like barely even breathe the

590
00:18:34,809 --> 00:18:38,890
ball finally to finish off our base

591
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:41,410
we're going to lightly bake our face but

592
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:46,420
because we're using more powder you guys

593
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:47,890
know the drill if you have dry skin i

594
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:49,330
would recommend skipping out on baking

595
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:50,980
although it is a helpful step it is

596
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:52,540
definitely not necessary and the

597
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:54,640
addition of more powder can sometimes

598
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:56,679
like I said beforehand add unwanted

599
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,900
texture but if you're like me and you

600
00:18:56,679 --> 00:19:00,580
have normal or oily skin baking can be a

601
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:02,470
really really great technique that not

602
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:04,210
only helps your makeup last longer but

603
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:06,250
also kind of brightens and enhance

604
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:07,450
everything just a little bit more once

605
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:09,100
again using my damp Beauty Blender and

606
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:10,600
dipping into that powder I always like

607
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:12,850
to start off by placing this baked right

608
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,860
on the sides of my nose to enforce the

609
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:19,290
highlights which once again further the

610
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:21,880
illusion of a pinched and snatched nose

611
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:23,590
if you're someone who's just starting

612
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,880
off with contouring or struggling with

613
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:26,380
placing the contour in the right place

614
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,990
I'm gonna grab a little bit more powder

615
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:31,300
and just pack this right underneath the

616
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:33,580
line of my contour and when I wipe this

617
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:35,320
off in a little while it's gonna kind of

618
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:37,270
brighten up that entire area and just

619
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,740
clean up the contour which just makes it

620
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:41,530
look a little bit more defined and a

621
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:43,060
little bit more cut and snatched while

622
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:45,220
this powder bakes in place that

623
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:47,350
completes the base makeup for today next

624
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:48,070
obviously comes brows and eyes but for

625
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,559
today's video

626
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:50,240
I'm

627
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,580
go ahead and do the eyebrows off-camera

628
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,480
and skipper on the eyeshadow today just

629
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:55,519
because I feel like there are literally

630
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,960
so many different questions techniques

631
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:58,190
and products that I like to use for

632
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,440
those specific steps that I make up

633
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:01,940
routine if you want a full in-depth

634
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,499
video on different eyebrow techniques

635
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:05,090
different eyeshadow styles and my

636
00:20:03,499 --> 00:20:06,499
eyeliner tutorial definitely give this

637
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:07,580
video a big thumbs up and leave me a

638
00:20:06,499 --> 00:20:08,389
comment down below because I could

639
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,499
totally do that

640
00:20:08,389 --> 00:20:11,690
I just don't want to keep you guys

641
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:12,919
sitting here for 17 hours because I feel

642
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:15,289
like that's already where we're getting

643
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:16,999
out here so I'm gonna do that and I'll

644
00:20:15,289 --> 00:20:20,419
be right back to finish off the rest of

645
00:20:16,999 --> 00:20:22,220
the look and yeah BRB ok sister so we

646
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:23,779
are so close to the end now that our

647
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:25,519
brows and lashes are all complete I'm

648
00:20:23,779 --> 00:20:27,169
gonna go ahead and a wipe off my bake

649
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:29,330
because that is rather my face for quite

650
00:20:27,169 --> 00:20:30,649
a long time though as you can see my

651
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:32,720
brushing away this powder kind of just

652
00:20:30,649 --> 00:20:34,429
did a really nice job of reinforcing all

653
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,779
those highlights underneath our contour

654
00:20:34,429 --> 00:20:38,240
so it just makes everything look nice

655
00:20:35,779 --> 00:20:39,470
and chisel we just wiped away a ton of

656
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,570
powder that was sitting on our face for

657
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:44,809
a very very long time so I'm sure you

658
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:46,820
can imagine what we're gonna do Mac's

659
00:20:44,809 --> 00:20:48,950
fix plus and then a fan to kind of

660
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:51,230
separating in place and really make the

661
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:52,879
excess powder melt into the skin to make

662
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:54,619
sure we say dewy and beautiful and

663
00:20:52,879 --> 00:20:55,610
smooth all day long

664
00:20:54,619 --> 00:20:57,259
now that we were completely done with

665
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:59,960
powder and we have nothing else to add

666
00:20:57,259 --> 00:21:01,190
it to the skin thank God I'm gonna go in

667
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,350
with a little bit more highlighter and

668
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:04,999
kind of reinforce the glow just in case

669
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:07,580
any of it was lost to that baking powder

670
00:21:04,999 --> 00:21:09,559
so once I got it over Miami 501 just the

671
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:10,730
slightest bit of fix+ and just going

672
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:12,350
right over those areas that we

673
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:15,230
highlighted before to really make sure

674
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:19,340
our glow is blinding - everybody passing

675
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:21,710
by oh yeah that's what I'm talking about

676
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:23,330
right right there so next I reckon

677
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:24,740
protein we have our lipid ado to us and

678
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:27,679
I'm sure you can already guess what the

679
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:29,990
question is for this but it is how do I

680
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,009
make my lips look bigger if you've been

681
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:32,600
following me for a while you know that

682
00:21:31,009 --> 00:21:35,509
my lips have definitely undergone a very

683
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:37,369
very large transformation definitely for

684
00:21:35,509 --> 00:21:39,679
the better one of the best ways to get

685
00:21:37,369 --> 00:21:41,779
bigger more plump looking lips is lip

686
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,100
filler you may think I'm kidding but it

687
00:21:41,779 --> 00:21:45,559
will be completely ridiculous for me to

688
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:47,090
act like I went from this to this with

689
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:49,490
just a little bit of over lining because

690
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:50,690
let's be real no lip pencil can do that

691
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:52,909
I don't know if I've ever talked about

692
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:55,279
this on camera before but I do have my

693
00:21:52,909 --> 00:21:57,020
lips done I have one full pile of

694
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:58,820
Juvederm on my top lip and half

695
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:00,590
on my bottom lip and they were done by

696
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:02,540
Johanna then nurse I'm gonna put her

697
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:04,070
Instagram right here this is not sponsor

698
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:06,020
I just really really love her and her

699
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:07,580
work I was genuinely very very hesitant

700
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,810
on whether or not to get them done I

701
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:10,850
didn't want people to think I looked

702
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:12,560
really ridiculous or unnatural but I

703
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:15,140
will say she did such an amazing job and

704
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:17,000
I am honestly so happy and far more

705
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:18,440
confident with my lips once I got them

706
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,090
done things like plastic surgery and

707
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,680
filler are obviously a very very

708
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:23,360
personal decision and I am definitely

709
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,740
not telling you guys to all run out and

710
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,860
go ask your parents for lip filler

711
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:29,450
please do not but if you've done your

712
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:31,250
research found your doctor planned out

713
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:33,230
financials because it can be very very

714
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:34,490
expensive and you feel deep down that it

715
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:36,590
will genuinely make you feel more

716
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:38,600
confident as a person then I would say

717
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:39,680
definitely go for it but if you don't

718
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,690
feel comfortable with that that is

719
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,620
totally okay I still have a few tips and

720
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:44,330
tricks to show you guys to make your

721
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:45,950
lips look more plump just with makeup

722
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:47,510
the personal impact I have for you guys

723
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:50,030
today is slightly over lining your lips

724
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:52,220
using a darker lip liner than the

725
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:53,450
lipstick shade you plan on using this

726
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:56,060
will make everything looking much more

727
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:57,080
plump and voluminous when over lighting

728
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,700
your lips I tortas like to start at the

729
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:00,530
Cupid's bow to just kind of build up the

730
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:02,240
natural shape and just go right outside

731
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:03,260
of the natural lip line now the one

732
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,640
mistake that people always make when

733
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:07,100
they're over lining is that they keep

734
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,080
over lining the entire top lip in

735
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:10,940
reality you want to take the line that

736
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:13,130
you just over line above the Cupid's bow

737
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:15,440
and follow that down but connected to

738
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:17,150
your actual natural inner corner of your

739
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,980
lip line this will create that illusion

740
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:21,290
of a more plump lip without giving you a

741
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:22,430
wider dry Qui type of effect which is

742
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:26,740
definitely not what we're going for

743
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:26,740
today just like that

744
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:32,920
there we go when it comes to the bottom

745
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,540
lip I really would not recommend

746
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,830
underlining it at all because I just

747
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:38,320
feel like the effect looks very very

748
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:40,450
weird in person and is definitely not a

749
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:42,250
true to the eye type of illusion like

750
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:47,410
the top lip so if anything just line

751
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:48,340
your lips like normal that of course is

752
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:49,540
the pie that lipstick right in the

753
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,950
center of your lips making sure to blend

754
00:23:49,540 --> 00:24:00,340
together the lipstick with the lip liner

755
00:23:50,950 --> 00:24:02,050
for that natural ombre look now what we

756
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:03,280
don't want is this very very harsh line

757
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:04,720
that you can see I definitely have quite

758
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,490
your honor right now so if it looks

759
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,350
crazy like this don't worry I'll have to

760
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:11,230
do is take your lip liner once again and

761
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:17,770
just go back in and blend right over

762
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:19,390
those edges you can totally leave them

763
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:20,590
like this the lip liner will stay all

764
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:21,730
day long and you can of course bring

765
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,570
your little lipstick with you if you

766
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,980
need any touch-ups

767
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:25,360
but if you want to take it one step

768
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:26,500
further and really go for like that

769
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,270
supermodel howdy

770
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:30,310
look what I like to do is take an even

771
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:33,550
lighter lip gloss this is the Too Faced

772
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:36,460
melted latex liquid lip gloss hello and

773
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:38,890
just place that gloss right in the

774
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:40,000
center of the lip

775
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:41,590
I personally am really not a fan of

776
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,480
placing gloss all over the lips because

777
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:45,670
by the end of the day the outer corners

778
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:47,590
are always so crusty and so gross you

779
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:49,840
have to keep cleaning them up nobody

780
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:51,430
wants to do that but by kind of cheating

781
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,530
and only placing the gloss in the center

782
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:55,270
you're avoiding all the trouble so

783
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:57,970
getting that beautiful glossy look that

784
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:59,590
we all know and love and it brings the

785
00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:01,150
eye right to the center of the lip once

786
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:03,760
again furthering the illusion of a

787
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:07,360
bigger lips finally last but not least

788
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:09,010
the last question for today is how do I

789
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,630
keep my makeup on all day long

790
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:13,510
of course the question we are all

791
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:15,370
wondering and I'll want to know every

792
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:16,270
day of course so many the different

793
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:17,380
techniques that I was talking about

794
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:20,020
today are really gonna help your makeup

795
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:21,760
last all day long so just pre priming

796
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:23,320
your nose of course setting your face

797
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,090
with powder and a damp Beauty Blender to

798
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:26,860
kind of melt it into the skin and even

799
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:28,420
baking to kind of reinforce those

800
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,860
highlights but the one thing that is of

801
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:31,630
course really going to help your makeup

802
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:33,640
last all day long is a really good

803
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:35,020
quality setting spray my personal

804
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,850
favorite is the skin to Navy eye makeup

805
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:38,260
finishing spray this one claims the last

806
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:40,780
for 16

807
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:42,460
and let me just tell you nobody should

808
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:44,230
ever have a face to makeup on it for 16

809
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:46,419
hours straight that is so gross and so

810
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:47,740
bad for your skin but sometimes we do

811
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:49,030
get in those emergencies where we need

812
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:50,049
to have a full face and makeup on for a

813
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:51,160
very very long time

814
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:53,290
so I definitely like to have a

815
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:54,610
long-lasting setting spray once in Rick

816
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:56,770
it was all complete and make sure all of

817
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:58,900
your powders are wiped off and then just

818
00:25:56,770 --> 00:26:05,320
go ahead and give your face and nice and

819
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:07,210
good it is very very generous squirt and

820
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:09,460
then just for the last time today

821
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:11,110
grab your fan and give it a good warm

822
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:12,640
and really let that setting spray it and

823
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:15,540
dry into your face and lock everything

824
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,540
in place

825
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,030
I'll bring scissors and that is the

826
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:20,890
finished look and the finished tutorial

827
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:22,330

lot of new information like I was saying

830
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:27,820

831
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:29,290

832
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,520
