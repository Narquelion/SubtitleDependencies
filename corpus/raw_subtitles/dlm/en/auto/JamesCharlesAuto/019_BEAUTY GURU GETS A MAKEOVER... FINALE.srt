00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:54,239
on my channel where I went to Sephora

00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,640
Mac and Ulta and got my makeup done at

30
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,530
all three locations I asked for this

31
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,539
picture right here of Jaclyn hill I'm

32
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,370
not gonna forget it this time and each

33
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:04,500
time came up with a very very different

34
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,700
result getting these mini glam makeovers

35
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,530

36
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,640
honestly so much fun and so cool to see

37
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,320

38
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,920
styles and techniques that they use on

39
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,090
me I honestly learned so so much but so

40
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,520
many of you guys were saying that for

41
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,229
the finale you guys wanted to see me do

42
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,030
the look on myself and do how I would

43
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:23,040
normally do the same exact look so for

44
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,450
today's video that is exactly what we're

45
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,939
doing I'm gonna be recreating that same

46
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,200
exact look from Jaclyn hill on myself

50
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:34,049

51
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,030
products talking about the truth tea

52
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:37,860

56
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:48,590
makeover series grand finale

57
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:48,590
[Music]

58
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:52,940
for my first step of my makeup routine

59
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:54,310
today I'm gonna grab the top out water

60
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:56,360
cream which is my all-time favorite

61
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:58,340
moisturizer I absolutely love using

62
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,570
moisturizer before my foundation and I

63
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:01,370
think a really really good skin care

64
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:03,740
routine is absolutely vital to a really

65
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:06,170
successful makeup routine and the places

66
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:08,000
that did that were Ulta and Sephora

67
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:09,770
before my makeover so major props to

68
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,700
them for that one side face is already a

69
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,900
nice and moisturized

70
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:14,150
of course my next step is going to be a

71
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,950
foundation and for today's economies in

72
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:18,740
the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD stick and

73
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:19,880
I am in the shade y2 45 right now the

74
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,590
makeup forever stick is definitely my

75
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,000
all-time pure foundations if you guys

76
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:24,740
been subscribed me for a while you know

77
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,900
that I've been using it for a very very

78
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:28,670
long time just as a reminder when I went

79
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,650
to Sephora the artists use the bare

80
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:32,450
minerals foundation on me when I went to

81
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,880
macrame artists used of course the Mac

82
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:37,100
Studio Fix fluid and when I went to Ulta

83
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,360
they used Born This Way and born swings

84
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,400
actually one of my all-time favorites as

85
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,260
well but the color was not exactly the

86
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,460
best match you guys know that I

87
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,080
definitely live a very very full

88
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:46,760
coverage type of base even when I do my

89
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,960
more light natural looks I still like a

90
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,460
very very full coverage foundation

91
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,140
because I do have pretty uneven skin

92
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,370
naturally and as well in the picture

93
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:55,580
that Jacqueline posted she is definitely

94
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:56,900
full beat glam there's no questions

95
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:58,160
about it so I feel like we definitely

96
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,900
needed a very very full coverage

97
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,220
foundation to match this look today for

98
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,780
consider today of course I'm going to

99
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,860
using my heart shape tube concealer you

100
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:06,680
guys don't this is my all-time favorite

101
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:08,209
and I'm in the shade light sand I'm just

102
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,100
gonna apply this underneath my eyes on

103
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:11,660
the sides of my nose for the snatch look

104
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,820
when it comes to contouring and all the

105
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:15,560
high points of my face just to add a lot

106
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:17,090
of dimension and my Sephora makeover my

107
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,070
artists use the NARS radiant creamy

108
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:20,390
concealer and iMac makeover my artists

109
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:22,610
use the new Mac Pro Longwear concealer

110
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:23,840
and it might also make over my artist

111
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:25,700
use that arch shape tape just like I'm

112
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,900
using right now so honestly we had a

113
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,280
really really good selection of

114
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,080
concealers in all the different places

115
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,850
that we went to then I'm gonna pond this

116
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,350
in it very very well using a damp Beauty

117
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:35,510
Blender unfortunately we have no

118
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:36,950
triangular makeup sponges today Mac's

119
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:38,060
gonna take my damp Beauty Blender and

120
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:40,100
dip it into my Laura Mercier translucent

121
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:42,440
setting powder and just use this to set

122
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:44,269
my entire face and like my foundation in

123
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,530
place and my Sephora makeover my artists

124
00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:47,150
use this powder which as you guys know

125
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:48,830
is my all-time favorite have I Mac

126
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:50,600
makeovers to use the Mac translucent

127
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:52,489
setting powder which spoiler alert I

128
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,900
absolutely hated that a my Ulta makeover

129
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:55,070
he used the it cosmetics trust as a

130
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,800
setting powder which I literally did not

131
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:57,750
even know it

132
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,250
said.but worked fine next to come onto

133
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:01,230
my face today I'm gonna grab my Kat Von

134
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:03,480
D shade and light palette a breeze my

135
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:04,860
morphe m14 one brush and dip into it the

136
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,660
last shade and that's tiny bit into the

137
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:08,190
middle shade and use this to it chisel

138
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:09,360
out my cheekbones in the photo that

139
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:11,160
Jacqueline posted she definitely had a

140
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,650
very very light and soft contour which

141
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,420
honestly is not really my cup of tea you

142
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:17,280
guys know that I love a good snatched

143
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:19,769
cheekbone a very very chiseled jawline

144
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,660
and definitely a contoured and lowered

145
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:23,400
forehead that is for sure

146
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,720
but obviously we're doing our best to

147
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,430
recreate the photos today so I'm gonna

148
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,980
go very very light on the contour powder

149
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:30,780
and make sure not to go too too crazy

150
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:32,940
and I support make over my artist use

151
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:34,530
the hourglass ambient lighting bronzer

152
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,910
to contour my face which I thought was a

153
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:37,380
little bit weird first of all I didn't

154
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:39,210
know it existed which obviously means

155
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,560
nothing but I felt as though it was a

156
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,970
little bit of a shimmery product which

157
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,380
is kind of weird for bronzer it

158
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:45,450
definitely was more of like a bronze or

159
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:47,010
harlot combo rather than a contour so I

160
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:49,470
do wish it was a little bit more chilled

161
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:51,330
out and a more cool toned softer type of

162
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:53,220
situation and Mac my artist actually

163
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:55,230
used the Mac of blotting powders in the

164
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,850
darkest shade which I thought was so so

165
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:58,530
cool because she used blotting powders

166
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:00,270
instead of an actual bronzer or contour

167
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:01,950
it gave her a really really light washed

168
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:03,450
a color which i thought was super super

169
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:05,760
dope I've never seen that done before

170
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:06,840
and I think that by adding that light

171
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,300
wash the color instead of like the

172
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,250
intense bronzer in contour and by far

173
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,630
gave that contour the most accurate to

174
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,400
the original picture of Jacqueline and I

175
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,720
loved how it looked and then finally for

176
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,669
the ultimate over my artists use the

177
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,080
anasazi Beverly Hills contour kit this

178
00:05:17,669 --> 00:05:20,460
is definitely one my all-time favorites

179
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,500
their products are so good and blend out

180
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:24,270
so smoothly it wasn't the best contra

181
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,560
but it also wasn't the worst now when it

182
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:27,630
comes to the nose I'm using a morphe

183
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,590
m4a3 3 brush in the same exact shades

184
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:30,480
from the Kat Von D shade and light

185
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:32,669
palette and I'm drawing my nose contour

186
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,960
very very tight together I'm not gonna

187
00:05:32,669 --> 00:05:35,280
talk about my nose contour in respect to

188
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,600
my Sephora makeover because I did not

189
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,310
ask for it to be contoured which is

190
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,870
definitely my faults that one is out of

191
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:42,690
the picture but I did ask for a pinched

192
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:44,280
nose contour at both Mac and Ulta and I

193
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:46,500
think that the result of both were

194
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,910
honestly not the best it is definitely

195
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,710
not like the nose contour and Mac or

196
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:51,750
Alta looked bad by any means it

197
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:53,130
literally took me a year to figure out

198
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,660
how to actually contour my nose and make

199
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:56,040
it look decent rather than just editing

200
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,120
it in every single photo so I really

201
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,500
don't blame them at all

202
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,990
but I definitely do think it both

203
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,460
makeovers if I say pinched nose it could

204
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:03,660
have been a little bit smaller and then

205
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,979
once again get er done by Laura Mercier

206
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,800
translucent setting powder and my damp

207
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:08,990
Beauty Blender and I'm going to lightly

208
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,330
my face to really intensify in my nose

209
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:12,680
contour and my cheekbone contour I

210
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,150
personally don't think it's that weird

211
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,009
that none of the artists chose to bake

212
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:17,240
me today honestly a lot of people think

213
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:18,379
that it's really really stupid and

214
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,759
doesn't really make a difference I

215
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:20,840
personally do see a difference

216
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,370
especially when it comes like the nose

217
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,020
contour baking the sides my nose has

218
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:26,659
literally changed my nose contour for

219
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:27,740
the better but I don't blame them baking

220
00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:29,389
is obviously a technique that started

221
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,740
from dry-cleans and is slowly trickled

222
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,479
its way until I can online social media

223
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:34,280
makeup but I feel like hasn't fully

224
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,020
integrated into like the regular beauty

225
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,270
world so I don't really think it's that

226
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:39,500
strange I ever won like I said I do love

227
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,190
baking so I'm just gonna do it on up

228
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,110
myself today

229
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:43,280
to really intensify those highlights all

230
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,080
right so while my face is baking in the

231
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,970
oven at 350 degrees I'm gonna go into my

232
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,770
brows and for today's also gonna use my

233
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:50,120
benefit precisely my brow pencil I

234
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:52,190
always terrify brows are drawing little

235
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,659
hair like strokes in the center just to

236
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:55,580
add a little bit of dimension and fill

237
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:57,620
them in slightly but not make them super

238
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:59,630
super defined and then I'll just go in

239
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:02,389
and start doing the tail all the tail

240
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:03,919
more out as opposed to down this design

241
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:05,930
that I actually recently changed my brow

242
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,520
routine too but I feel good is honestly

243
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:09,440
made the world of her difference it

244
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,210
makes my brows look more arch with stare

245
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,759
for it just gives me a more like lifted

246
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:15,380
and pretty look to my face and it also

247
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,270
gives me a lot more room for eyeshadow

248
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:19,490
so I feel like drawing them out is my

249
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:21,469
new favorite brow trick and it just

250
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:23,419
flatters my face really really well for

251
00:07:21,469 --> 00:07:25,279
both my Sephora and Ulta makeovers my

252
00:07:23,419 --> 00:07:27,469
artists use the anasazi at Brown to

253
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:30,229
finer to define at my brows and for my

254
00:07:27,469 --> 00:07:31,759
Mac makeover she use the Mac brow pencil

255
00:07:30,229 --> 00:07:33,680
which I've actually never used before

256
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,419
brows are definitely a really really

257
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,310
personal thing when it comes to makeup I

258
00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:39,020
feel like things such as like base

259
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:41,120
makeup contouring highlighting and then

260
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:43,190
like eyeshadow or very much like one

261
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,289
style fits most type of situation but

262
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:47,270
brows like frame the entire face they

263
00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:48,800
can change your entire facial shape or

264
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:50,630
structure or expression so I feel like

265
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,400
brows are like a very very vital thing

266
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:54,080
and are very very personal which is

267
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,759
probably why I didn't really like any of

268
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,050
the brows for employee restore and I

269
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,669
definitely do how much to what I would

270
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:00,469
normally do I don't think any of the

271
00:07:58,669 --> 00:08:01,909
eyebrows were particularly bad all of

272
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:03,349
the Ulta one definitely could have had a

273
00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:04,969
little bit more attention paid to them

274
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:06,380
but I just think they weren't really my

275
00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:08,150
style and then just gonna go to my

276
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:09,560
benefit give me a brow gel just to brush

277
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:11,210
through all those hairs and lock them in

278
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,580
place you guys know that I am definitely

279
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:15,620
someone who has a lot of eyebrows that

280
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:16,940
is for sure so I always like to use a

281
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,660
brow so just make sure those hairs are

282
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,740
not gonna go

283
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:21,080
anywhere and they're gonna say it nice

284
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:22,400
and defined all day long so once my

285
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,900
eyebrows are almost laid and in place on

286
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,760
my eyelids are all primed and ready to

287
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,230
go for shadow and of course gonna do the

288
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:30,380
eyes and for today's like I'm gonna use

289
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:33,169
the brand new morphe 15 D which is the

290
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:35,150
day Slayer palette I'm first gonna grab

291
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:37,490
the shade in the crease I'm I am 513

292
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:39,200
brush and put that shade in the crease

293
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:40,610
Alexson use the m4 3/3 brush in the

294
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,470
shade editor and use that to deepen up

295
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:43,789
the crease and the outer corner add my

296
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:45,560
Sephora makeover my artists use the

297
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:48,020
Sephora Pro palette in the warm tones

298
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,880
and by Mac makeover she used individual

299
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:51,320
shadows and I my ultimate go over here

300
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,960
use the Anasazi of Modern Renaissance

301
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,910
palette I felt a so for the actual color

302
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,320
of this eye look none of the makeovers

303
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:59,030
actually were that accurate to the

304
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,590
original I feel like all three of them

305
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:02,120
turned out very very red in the end

306
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:03,920
whereas this look is obviously super

307
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,750
super orange which is a little bit weird

308
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,890
I remember at the Sephora makeover the

309
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,630
honest I don't look was actually done

310
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:10,250
really really well but the gold shadow

311
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:11,870
used for the actual lid was just a

312
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:14,030
really strange color that didn't match

313
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:15,530
very well my Mac makeover I think was

314
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,610
the best eye shadow look overall it

315
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:18,320
looked very very beautiful and

316
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:19,730
well-planned it and then my Alta

317
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,410
makeover I felt like my artist used the

318
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:22,910
closest technique to the original but it

319
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:24,980
was just a really really weird at crease

320
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:26,360
shape I'm exited I might add one to four

321
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:28,610
which is just a small Packer brush and

322
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,410
dip into the shade mob and use this to

323
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:32,330
it deepen up that outer V that are

324
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:33,830
sitting on my m4 33 one more time for my

325
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:37,510
last step and go over those edges to

326
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:37,510
make sure that there are no harsh lines

327
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,269
they're gonna grab the brand-new morphia

328
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:42,589
cream shadow in the shade of bronze this

329
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:44,480
from the new holiday collection you guys

330
00:09:42,589 --> 00:09:46,010
have to check these out and I'm gonna

331
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,269
use that to carve out the lid and then

332
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:48,589
just add a little bit more glitter to

333
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:51,170
make it pop we're gonna grab the Urban

334
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:53,240
Decay heavy metal liquid glitter liner

335
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:54,890
and just pop a tiny bit of that on the

336
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,060
lid when I came to the actual lid my

337
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:57,980
alte artist was the only one who

338
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:59,180
actually embraced the whole half cut

339
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,740
crease type of situation which was

340
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:03,050
definitely going on in the Jacqueline

341
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:05,149
photo but even still all three artists

342
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:06,620
only use it I shadow for the actual base

343
00:10:05,149 --> 00:10:07,730
I found that a little bit weird because

344
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:09,260
in the photo of Joplin you can

345
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:11,240
definitely tell it there is a little bit

346
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:13,040
of a glitter situation going on I was

347
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,480
disappointed in the lid situation to all

348
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,579
three different locations especially

349
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,170
Sephora and Ulta because the steel and

350
00:10:16,579 --> 00:10:19,579
liquid metals things are sold in both

351
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:21,470
locations and those are so beyond

352
00:10:19,579 --> 00:10:22,760
beautiful I use those for almost all my

353
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:24,769
concrete's and they're extremely

354
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,329
glittery as well so I do wish something

355
00:10:24,769 --> 00:10:28,040
a little bit more glittery or true to

356
00:10:26,329 --> 00:10:29,480
the original photo was used so that is

357
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,100
why we're going extra glam

358
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,910
today for the lower lash seven person

359
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,470
we're going to add four three three

360
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:35,720
brush and the shade editor and just buff

361
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:37,100
that in and then just using ym5 13 brush

362
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,930
that i have my original transition shade

363
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:42,310
on I'm gonna go over those edges to make

364
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:45,260
sure they are really really blended out

365
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:47,089
I'm then gonna grab an Abbott one five

366
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:48,680
one brush into the shade mauve and I'm

367
00:10:47,089 --> 00:10:50,089
going to use is to hug at the waterline

368
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,949
and then I'm just gonna line my lower

369
00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:54,260
waterline today using the pretty vulgar

370
00:10:51,949 --> 00:10:56,449
pencil and obviously the nude shade I

371
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:58,010
definitely like a good and new water

372
00:10:56,449 --> 00:11:04,610
line I feels like it opens up the eye a

373
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:05,839
lot so now that the eye is all done the

374
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:07,519
next up is obviously going to be the

375
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,260
eyelashes and for today I picked up

376
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,699
through Billie washes in the style Doha

377
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:12,019
I feel so these are the closest pair

378
00:11:10,699 --> 00:11:13,250
that I have that looks close to what

379
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:15,800
Jacqueline was wearing so I'm just gonna

380
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:17,390
pop on this one today for my Sephora

381
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,940
makeover I was given a Sephora brand

382
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:22,070
lash fry Mac makeover I was given a Mac

383
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:25,160
brand lash and for my ultimate over I

384
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:27,290
had it in our Dell brand lash all the

385
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,880
lashes were actually applied like the

386
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:30,079
artists all had a really good knowledge

387
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,339
of how to apply that right to the lash

388
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,589
line and how to make it the glue like

389
00:11:31,339 --> 00:11:35,000
knock it I'll walk Ian sucked my eye

390
00:11:33,589 --> 00:11:36,170
clearly I don't have that knowledge

391
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,399
because I'm having a lot of trouble

392
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:38,870
putting this on right now

393
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:40,010
lashes are Selma at least a part of my

394
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:41,660
makeup routine because they're always

395
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:44,410
are really really wonky free I don't

396
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:46,630
know what it is but I can just never get

397
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:48,370
okay example uh there are no gaps that

398
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:50,110
are comfortable to wear which is amazing

399
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:52,120
but I felt as though all three

400
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:54,310
lifestyles were not really that close to

401
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,690
the ones that Jacqueline had on and I

402
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:57,370
would definitely not choose wear any of

403
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:58,690
them again alright guys that is when I

404
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:59,710
all complete I'm gonna go ahead and

405
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:01,060
quickly do the other one on off-camera

406
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:02,590
to save some time and I'll be right back

407
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:04,240
to finish off the rest of this love

408
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:05,590
alright guys and those are both eyes off

409
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,660
complete and the next step is going to

410
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:08,860
be of course the glow before we go in

411
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,600
and actually play anyhow later today I'm

412
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:12,430
gonna play a light spritz of these skins

413
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,900
a navy eye makeup finishing spray I

414
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:15,100
always like to apply a little bit of

415
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,180
settings right before I apply my

416
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,890
highlighter just so it's really really

417
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:19,570
vibrant and of course you guys know I'm

418
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:22,660
gonna use my Anasazi illuminator and so

419
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:24,250
Hollywood and my morphe M 501 brush so

420
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:25,510
my artists at both Ulta and Sephora use

421
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,190
the chocolate health elaboration with

422
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:29,080
Becca cosmetics champagne pop

423
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:30,190
highlighter and I thought it was so cute

424
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,200
sense obviously this look it's a

425
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:34,000
chocolate hill inspired look and then my

426
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,860
artist that Mac used the soft and gentle

427
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,540
highlighter I thought my Holly had all

428
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:39,070
three looks was decent they definitely

429
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:40,990
also had a little bit more vibrant I do

430
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:42,550
love a good glow and in the picture of

431
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:44,140
Jacqueline she is definitely like

432
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:46,480
blinding the haters left right with your

433
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:47,650
highlight which I am love what I did

434
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,450
think was weird about the highlight from

435
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:51,850
all three lunches that all three artists

436
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:53,410
use a really really big brush for

437
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:55,150
applying a highlighter don't get me

438
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:56,380
wrong I definitely love a good duyst

439
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:58,570
again luck you guys see me trying to

440
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:59,830
achieve it all the time but I do feel

441
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:01,300
like the replaces the highlighter should

442
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:02,950
be in place the highlighter shouldn't be

443
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,480
and because of the size of the brush to

444
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,920
all three artists use I didn't feel like

445
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,000
the cheeks and like the under-eye region

446
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,470
was a little bit shinier than I

447
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,460
typically like it when it comes to

448
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:10,930
highlight me the nose I'm gonna once

449
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:12,940
again it got that tiny pencil brush and

450
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:15,960
just draw a really really thin line onto

451
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:18,040
the tip and then down the nose bridge

452
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:19,600
once again going back to the contour

453
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,550
thing you guys know I love a pinched

454
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,020
nose and to achieve that with makeup it

455
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,910
definitely takes a lot of different

456
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:26,830
steps one of them is definitely using a

457
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:28,240
really really tiny brush privacy Holly

458
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:29,680
is gonna bring the eye forward and draw

459
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,090
attention to it so by using a pencil

460
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,770
brush you're just furthering the

461
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:34,510
illusion and the only artist that did

462
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:36,100
that was my back artist Helen and it was

463
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:37,900
so amazing and I felt like her nose

464
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,130
contour was by far the best

465
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,630
and then finally to finish off this look

466
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:42,130
today I'm gonna go into the Kat Von D

467
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:43,900
liquid lipstick in the shade Vampira

468
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:45,580
when I first saw the photo of Jacqueline

469
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:47,290
this was the first liquid lipstick to

470
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:49,240
come to my head I feel so it'll be a

471
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:51,130
perfect match to the photo so I was so

472
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,110
excited to see my Sephora artist playing

473
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,560
this oh that my Mac artist used the

474
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:56,690
carnivorous look on the website from

475
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,160
the back and my altar artist he was the

476
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:59,810
anasazi logo that was in the shade

477
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,880
trust but then again we remember I

478
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:03,320
picked that one up from a band not him

479
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:05,090
and yes what I'm applying this I'm

480
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,500
making sure to over line while applying

481
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:07,550
this I did go ahead and add two coats

482
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,900
because as you remember it in the

483
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:10,640
Sephora video and even looking in it

484
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,660
right now this lipstick is a little bit

485
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,430
streaky so I did want to make sure to

486
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:14,480
get it super super opaque and then

487
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:15,830
finally last but not least I'm gonna

488
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:24,230
finish this off using the skin to Navy

489
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:25,550
eye makeup finishing spray alright guys

490
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:27,800
and that is the beauty guru gets a

491
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:30,320
makeover at his own beauty station look

492
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:32,000
all complete here is the finished look

493
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,350
now that you guys have seen my version

494
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,150
with all of my favorite techniques and

495
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:37,610
products let's go ahead and compare all

496
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:39,230
four looks my first makeover was at

497
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:42,260
Sephora and my artist was named Crystal

498
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:44,900
she was so so sweet my makeover ended up

499
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:45,650
costing me $50 and they rated it a 7 out

500
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,970
of 10

501
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:48,470
my artists did a really really great job

502
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,339
and this makeover was a little bit

503
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,750
different for the other ones in the

504
00:14:49,339 --> 00:14:52,490
series because it was the first episode

505
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:54,320
and I wasn't asking for specific things

506
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:56,540
like nose contour and for less harsh

507
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,250
bronzer and stuff like that so I don't

508
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:59,870
want to knock her too hard although I

509
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,130
did dislike the foundation I thought it

510
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:02,480
so it wasn't really that full coverage

511
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:03,800
and I felt as though some of the

512
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,810
eyeshadow tones were a little bit off

513
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:08,240
from the original my next makeover was

514
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:10,550
that Mac my artist was Helen it cost me

515
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,260
$60 and I rated this makeover an 8 out

516
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:13,940
of 10 my artists had been working at Mac

517
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:16,040
for over 10 years and her expertise

518
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:17,570
really really showed her blending was

519
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,430
absolutely impeccable I love the eye

520
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:20,600
shadow on this look although I do wish

521
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:21,680
she added a little bit more setting

522
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,990
powder because I started to get very

523
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,160
very oily very quickly and I felt as

524
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,900
though I was getting some creases and

525
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,430
she also underlined my lips which I felt

526
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:30,530
wasn't really that flattering to my face

527
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:32,450
shape my next night cover was at Ulta my

528
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:34,070
artist was Darrell it cost me once again

529
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:36,410
$60 that I ended up writing this

530
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:37,700
makeover a 7 out of 10 I really liked

531
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:38,900
this makeover in the sense that he used

532
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,220
a lot of the same products and

533
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,900
techniques that I usually use in my

534
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:43,490
normal routine such as Too Faced Born

535
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,080
This Way Foundation and turn shape tape

536
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:46,220
although there was some weird things

537
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:48,080
that the pink of the foundation shade

538
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:49,670
was nowhere near my skin tone once I

539
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,839
left the store but that's like a whole

540
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:52,580
lighting situation that I don't even

541
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:54,290
want to get into and then of course my

542
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:55,850
cut crease was a little bit of a really

543
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:57,350
really wonky shape that I don't think

544
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:58,610
flattered my eyes now that we've

545
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:59,720
compared all the details of off for

546
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:00,680
makeovers let's compare them

547
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,160
side-by-side

548
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:07,890
first we went to Sephora

549
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:11,620
then he went to Mac then was Ulta and

550
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:12,640
then finally my own work looking at all

551
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:14,410
four of these books next to each other

552
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,700
it is so cool to see all the different

553
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:17,290
techniques and products to use but all

554
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,790
the different artists even though we

555
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:21,100
went into each experience with the same

556
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:22,810
exact photo I think it is the R is so

557
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,790
cool that each look looks very very

558
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:25,960
different and unique in their own ways

559
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:27,070
there are things that I love on each

560
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,480
look and there are also things that I

561
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:30,010
don't love as much but overall I think

562
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,620
all three makeovers were a huge success

563
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:35,290
in the end taking into consideration the

564
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:37,450
final look techniques use products use

565
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:39,340
prices and just treatment overall I

566
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:44,230
think my grand prize winner for this

567
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:45,760
makeover finale is Mac getting a Mac

568
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:47,920
makeover I felt incredibly comfortable

569
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,880
the entire time my artist was super kind

570
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,320
it was definitely extremely

571
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,880
knowledgeable about the makeup process

572
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:55,090
which obviously you want if you're

573
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:56,590
getting a glam makeover well $60 wise on

574
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:57,970
the higher end of the price tags for the

575
00:16:56,590 --> 00:17:00,250
makeovers I felt as though I was

576
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:01,210
definitely paying for expertise I feel

577
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,650
as though the things that I didn't like

578
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:04,480
as much about the look being the lack of

579
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:06,250
setting powder and the underlined lips

580
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,750
are two things that can really easily be

581
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:09,280
fixed by simply saying something

582
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,390
obviously you guys watching this know

583
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,709
that I tried to say as little as

584
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:13,240
possible just to see what the artist

585
00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:14,410
would come up with on their own but

586
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,699
obviously if you're gonna get makeup

587
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:17,530
done you should speak up because any

588
00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:19,089
artist is being paid to paint your face

589
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:20,199
and to make you look good so you should

590
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:22,120
be getting what you want as a client

591
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:23,530
even though Mac was my personal winner

592
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,209
