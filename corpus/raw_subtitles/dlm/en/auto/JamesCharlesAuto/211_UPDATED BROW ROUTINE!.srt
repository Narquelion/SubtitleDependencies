00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:09,179
hi sisters James Charles here and

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:10,559
welcome back to my channel since the

3
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:12,360
very very start of my Instagram feed and

4
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,650
following in general my brows have

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,030
always been something that are very very

6
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,550
controversial and always that widely

7
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,990
talked about people either love my bushy

8
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,430
defined brows or they hate them with a

9
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,189
passion and they describe them as things

10
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,840
like Lego or caterpillars but either way

11
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:28,230
they're still talking about them which

12
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,699
in PR sense is very very good rather to

13
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,320
what people think though my brows have

14
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:32,969
changed very very drastically from the

15
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,340
start of my Instagram career they've

16
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:37,920
gotten much more natural still large and

17
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,270
in charge but much less sharp II like so

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,410
for today's video I thought I would sit

19
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,640
down and do it update a brow routine

20
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,350
because I don't think I've ever actually

21
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,760
done one on this channel before and I

22
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,680
get so many questions every single video

23
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,789
asked me how I do my brows because for

24
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,390
the most part I do usually do them

25
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:50,550
off-camera

26
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,289
to save time so that being said if you

27
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,780
want to see how I get my very very

28
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:56,699
natural yet bushy large enough charts

29
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,070
and defined brows make sure you keep on

30
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:00,930
watching alright so I already went ahead

31
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,480
it and I did my base up camera that

32
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:04,769
being my foundation concealer powdered

33
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,119
my entire face did a little bit of

34
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:08,520
contour and highlight just so doesn't

35
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:10,470
look too weird and then baked my face as

36
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,700
well and then it wiped it off I do this

37
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,409
in every single video and then my next

38
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,180
step would usually be my eyebrows which

39
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:18,090
I usually do off-camera just to save

40
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,619
time but like I was saying today we were

41
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,060
going to be doing my brow routine which

42
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:23,130
is what I do in every single look

43
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,080
whether or not it's on camera my brows

44
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,430
have changed so drastically since the

45
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,360
beginning of my Instagram career so I

46
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:29,189
thought it would be absolutely perfect

47
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,960
to sit down today and team up with

48
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:33,299
Benefit Cosmetics they give you guys an

49
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,380
updated brow routine just shot off my

50
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:35,909
brows today I'm just gonna grab the

51
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,380
benefit process in my eyebrow pencil and

52
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:39,479
I'm just gonna shake off the bottom end

53
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,490
to use the spoolie and I'm actually just

54
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:43,229
going to start by brushing through via

55
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:45,790
bra Harris and brush them all kind of

56
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:47,440
upwards just to see kind of how big

57
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:49,150
and bushy eyebrows we are just to get a

58
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:52,320
good idea of where underneath filling in

59
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:54,310
and what areas and don't need as much

60
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,350
first product I'm going to go ahead with

61
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:58,150
is the Bravo conditioning primer and I'm

62
00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:02,260
just going to take the top off and I'm

63
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:03,400
going to do this a few million times and

64
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:05,410
I'm just gonna run it through the brow

65
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,660
hairs just like a primer for your face

66
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:10,119
this is a primer for your brow hair so

67
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:11,560
it just gets them nice and ready to pull

68
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:13,120
product and really ensures that your

69
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,830
brows will last all day long

70
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,840
and it also makes like I said before

71
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:18,880
your brows as full as possible so you

72
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,950
get a good idea of where you should be

73
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:23,200
putting the product and getting your

74
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:24,550
brows on fleek and I'm just gonna go on

75
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,020
the back and let's we'll leave one more

76
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:28,390
time just to evenly distribute that

77
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:31,290
product through the brow hairs and once

78
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:31,290
again it push the hair

79
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:44,270
if you have any straight brown hair this

80
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,980
would be a perfect time to grab your

81
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:47,630
tweezers and pluck them up before we get

82
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,950
too far into the filling in and the rest

83
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:50,480
of the brow routine

84
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:52,070
I'm just really carefully plucking out

85
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,730
any stray hairs that I know are not

86
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:57,260
going to be in I do get asked all the

87
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:59,090
time - like who does your eyebrows only

88
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,770
loudly but you get them done and I

89
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:02,930
actually do my brows completely myself

90
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:04,520
I've been tweezing my own brows for a

91
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:06,410
very very long time and I do consider

92
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,970
myself pretty good at it at this point I

93
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:10,520
also taste a lot of my friends brows as

94
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:12,160
well and have made some fantastic brow

95
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:14,630
transformations if I do say so myself

96
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:17,180
but I really do like tweezing my brow I

97
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:19,820
would not trust anybody else to wax or

98
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:21,320
the red now I'm just way too scared and

99
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:23,570
obviously as a beauty - I have a very

100
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,980
very distinct style of what I like my

101
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,810
brows to look like but if you are

102
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:28,730
someone who wants to get them through or

103
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:31,370
tweeze please do this is definitely not

104
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:32,870
like an easy thing to do in any way

105
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:34,640
shape or form and if you don't trust

106
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:38,510
yourself please leave it to a

107
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:40,490
professional because I've seen stories

108
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:41,960
my poor mom is someone who actually had

109
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:43,400
definitely overlooked her broadly she

110
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,320
was younger and now she regrets it all

111
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,850
the time and she's always asking me to

112
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:50,360
draw in her brows for her which I always

113
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:51,980
do a course but the poor girl barely has

114
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,150
any eyebrows left so definitely be

115
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,530
careful when you're plucking and go to

116
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,720
professional if you don't trust your

117
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:57,950
self home to actually fill in and shape

118
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,450
the brows that I'm gonna be using once

119
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:00,709
again deep resizing my brow pencil in

120
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:03,320
the shade number 4

121
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:04,850
I like oops I like the tip of this

122
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,920
because it is super super tiny and

123
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:09,680
defined so it really lets me get really

124
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:11,390
really light and defined lines and in

125
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,680
this front area - I can really sketch in

126
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:14,750
those tiny hairs and make it look

127
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,070
realistic I don't like to start off my

128
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,780
brows like kind of sketching out the

129
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:18,950
bottom line so I'm just going to start

130
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:22,070
on the front here and I'm going to

131
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:25,150
really really really lightly it'd be

132
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:25,150
good to shape out the

133
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:32,639
as you guys can see my brother's really

134
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,350
do not have that much of an arch either

135
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,820
so when I'm in this inner corner I

136
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:38,280
really like to start kind of low and

137
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:40,020
pull it up at an angle creating more of

138
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,580
an arch effect that isn't really there

139
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,050
and then of course if I make any

140
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,310
mistakes or anything looks too harsh

141
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:46,169
I'll just switch over to the spoolie end

142
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:47,100
and I'll comb really lightly over it

143
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:48,600
just to it

144
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,190
Oh throughout this entire video I'm

145
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,840
going to using this spoolie and this a

146
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,760
lot just kind of switching back and

147
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,010
forth back and forth to get the perfect

148
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,690
results when I get to the outer corner

149
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:59,400
I'm going to take it the Pens lit number

150
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:07,919
two really lightly flick it out towards

151
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:09,060
the end just like when it comes to

152
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,710
shaping your browser obviously gonna

153
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,930
want to do what works best for your face

154
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:14,610
shape but I find for me personally the I

155
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:16,440
really like to say eyebrows that goes up

156
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:18,330
and then kind of out I don't really like

157
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,970
when my brows go down I feel like I have

158
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:22,860
like a very very tall face so I like to

159
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:25,260
kind of widen it as much as possible so

160
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,030
by pulling this brow out towards like

161
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:29,760
this area rather than towards the bottom

162
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:31,979
of my cyber I get a much like wider more

163
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:35,100
masculine effect I guess but do whatever

164
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:36,600
works best for you I'm not grabbing that

165
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,860
pencil I'm going to start defining the

166
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,860
tail so I'm just drawing a line

167
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:47,450
connecting it right down to that point

168
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:49,190
then like I said it grimy that's fully

169
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:54,200
to just blend forward and food

170
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:55,760
traditions like I said I'd really to

171
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,980
fake a little bit of an arch on my brow

172
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:00,260
I'm like before once again thank God

173
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,670
those old brow days are over I'm going

174
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:03,230
to what start by grabbing the pencil and

175
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:08,900
I'm going to really lightly sketch a

176
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:10,430
horn line if anything I like the of

177
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,200
bottom some eyebrows to be a little bit

178
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:14,690
to find it but I don't like the top to

179
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,340
be super defined well because that's

180
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:17,960
when we get into like the Lego Sharpie

181
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:20,090
style borrow that they used to have and

182
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:23,330
that style is over up done with pencil

183
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:24,710
never wants to get again when it comes

184
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:26,330
to the inner corner of the brow I really

185
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:27,560
like the hairs to be very very wispy

186
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:29,960
looking and I like there to be a natural

187
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,820
ombre from the front to the tip of the

188
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,770
brow this part obviously being a whole

189
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:35,600
lot darker I'm just guessing in a few

190
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:37,400
tiny little hairs really really lightly

191
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,990
in the front here just to kind of give

192
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:45,440
it a little bit of shape but not doing

193
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:46,910
any real filling and and then once again

194
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,590
describing these spoolie on the end of

195
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:50,120
the precisely my brow pencil and just

196
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:51,320
brushing through the brow hairs to kind

197
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,360
of brush them up in the right direction

198
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,650
and the blend through the product and

199
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,630
making sure that there is no area where

200
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:58,250
it is very very concentrated you know

201
00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:00,320
any sparse area that we don't want any

202
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:05,630
it's are four areas either the goal is

203
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:07,040
to have that nice but still defined what

204
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:08,540
that brought us all a roughly put in

205
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,920
place my next up is gonna be to grab my

206
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:12,080
favorite concealer watch it right now

207
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:14,030
with the tarik tape tape and just put a

208
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,590
little bit on the back of my hand and

209
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:17,600
then we're just going to clean up that

210
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:19,520
brow I'm gonna really let they follow

211
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,710
the line that I sketched in using the

212
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,270
brow pencil and like I said before it

213
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:25,250
does not need to be a perfect because

214
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:27,670
now at the time we get to clean up any

215
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,670
mistakes

216
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:37,670
regardless of what products steps or

217
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:39,860
techniques you use and your brow routine

218
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:42,260
I feel like this is one set that is

219
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:44,030
absolutely by all no matter who you are

220
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:46,310
or what your shape is or like but your

221
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:47,990
style is and like just cleaning up via

222
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:50,060
bottom of the brows makes it look so

223
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:51,560
much more defined makes them with a

224
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:54,200
whole lot cleaner and I would definitely

225
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:56,210
recommend you to do that if you don't

226
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:58,100
already do it now that the brow is all

227
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:59,420
smashed and defined my last and final

228
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:01,310
step it's going to be to go in to be a

229
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:03,260
benefit gimme brow gel in the shade and

230
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:05,840
number three I absolutely love this brow

231
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:07,640
gel because the wand is so freakin tiny

232
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,660
so you can really get in on the hangers

233
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,550
and make sure you're not gonna make any

234
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:12,530
mistakes I can't even tell you how many

235
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:13,280
times I've gotten my brows to look so

236
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:14,930
frickin good

237
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,150
and then I've bought into the brow gel

238
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:19,130
and just got like one brown line or

239
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:20,390
smudge little get the worst thing in the

240
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:22,370
entire world so like I said I really

241
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:23,390
really do it like this wand just like

242
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:25,100
they couldn't see that under the brows I

243
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:26,690
really really really good at brow gel

244
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,820
it's an absolute necessity I need it

245
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:30,260
good or protein just because as the day

246
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,970
goes on and your sweat cons hard to

247
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,530
remove product and the hairs are gonna

248
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,820
start to move around so this challenge

249
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:40,479
is really in terms of the hair stay

250
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:42,860
locked in place in the market what

251
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,420
alright guys I just draw in some lashes

252
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:46,580
and a quick gloss and that is the

253
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:48,410
completed look and video for today my

254
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:50,750
