00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,360
hi sisters James Charles here and

2
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:05,400
welcome back to my you to tale or should

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,690
I say good morning sisters as you can

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,610
see I'm looking a little bit different I

5
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:10,920
literally just woke up I look like I got

6
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,809
hit by a bus I'm right here and this is

7
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,250
a studio because I have a very very fun

8
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:15,809
and fresh video for you guys today

9
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,520
some of my most requested videos of all

10
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:20,070
time have na a morning routine you guys

11
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,570
always asked for that a skincare routine

12
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,609
I'm really not sure why when my skin is

13
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,050
looking as super problematic oh haze and

14
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:26,609
also a how I do my hair routine which

15
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,349
also comes as a shock to me considering

16
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:30,269
it looks like a rat's nest half the time

17
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:32,730
but I figured why not kind of like merge

18
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:34,350
them all into one I just woke up it is

19
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:35,940
super early in the morning I have a lot

20
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,380
to do today I have to be on set in a few

21
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,790
hours I have a bunch of meetings and I

22
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,770
have a dinner to go to later on tonight

23
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,270
I do not have time to get fully glammed

24
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,980
this morning but I do want to get ready

25
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,750
and still look super super cute so I

26
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,280
figured for today's video I would take

27
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,360
you guys to my morning routine and show

28
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,250
you guys how I actually get ready in the

29
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,079
morning and go from looking like this to

30
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,239
actually kind of low-key a little bit

31
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,100
good look at him without actually my

32
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,510
full glam makeup process so if you guys

33
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:04,510
are interested in that keep on watching

34
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:06,979
[Music]

35
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:10,900
all right sisters rise and shine and

36
00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:10,900
give God his the CSD I can't fail

37
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,220
I just don't mind put on a quick little

38
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,530
cute a sister's elfin without the

39
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:19,610
sisters dr. Carol calm but the person

40
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:23,869
that was doing the morning is coming

41
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:25,009
right into that master contacts if you

42
00:01:23,869 --> 00:01:26,720
guys want to be on snapchat you know

43
00:01:25,009 --> 00:01:29,930
that I wear glasses on an everyday basis

44
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,640
because a sister cannot see to say as

45
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:32,869
life but Ren glasses with makeup is a

46
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,520
little bit problematic since it always

47
00:01:32,869 --> 00:01:37,310
leaves those annoying little lines right

48
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:39,440
there so I do like to pop in my colored

49
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:41,030
contacts by the way for those you guys

50
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:43,100
who always ask my contacts are from

51
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:44,990
Desio and i also saw that every morning

52
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:49,820
that brushing my teeth just every person

53
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:51,200
should plain brush water and toothpaste

54
00:01:49,820 --> 00:02:07,790
what are you talking about I never wet

55
00:01:51,200 --> 00:02:09,440
at first so normally now I would hop

56
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:11,870
right into the shower and get ciserek

57
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,519
squeaky clean I personally am a grenade

58
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:14,900
shower I have a lot of trouble getting

59
00:02:13,519 --> 00:02:17,360
up in the morning so a shower really

60
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,620
helps me awaken and get ready for the

61
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,269
day I know some people into shower at

62
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,860
night personal preference please don't

63
00:02:20,269 --> 00:02:23,570
attack me but for today I actually do

64
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:25,190
have a haircut appointment schedules

65
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:29,030
we're gonna have it right downstairs for

66
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:30,530
me my hair is like very very important I

67
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,910
don't know why but I always just have a

68
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:34,730
lot of insecurities on my hair growing

69
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:35,030
up as a kid I think probably one too

70
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:37,370
many

71
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:38,420
mortifying haircuts that maybe look even

72
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,010
I'm clear that I already well it's

73
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:42,019
grayed out so now I'm here in LA and I'm

74
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:43,910
so willing to eat my hair super super

75
00:02:42,019 --> 00:02:45,739
clean it looks better in photos looks

76
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:47,350
better on video and I just feel a lot

77
00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:53,299

78
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:55,340

million percent better and ready to take

on the day but we still touchdown

103
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:09,590
because I probably smell gross and I

104
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:12,760

108
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:40,170
seating up I'm giving a lot of questions

109
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:42,270
about bathing suits we have four shorts

110
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:43,650

completes heating up the first thing

115
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,150
that I'm gonna do is actually part one

116
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,640
of my skincare routine I'm gonna relay

117
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:55,320
it's Anita lemon cream a cleanser this

118
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:59,130

119
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:11,780
skin I'm gonna go to translate a lot my

120
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:11,780
guns to really scrub it up a little bit

121
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,390
bigger than on the first ride I'm used

122
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,310
to it drop off my facial cleanser

123
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:26,460
because this also acts I had been

124
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:28,129
exfolia highway security that 2008 book

125
00:05:26,460 --> 00:06:12,080

the brand of the spice and I love a

129
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:19,490
second as well so it's maybe just a port

130
00:06:17,659 --> 00:06:21,199
in trouble I do a little bit more point

131
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:23,599
leadership I don't wash it every day but

132
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,919
the kind of the exam is very texture and

133
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:26,749
all of all when you're doing with each

134
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:29,300
other for rumps ought to have it sounded

135
00:06:26,749 --> 00:06:30,949
like having a little bit of like wear in

00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:40,909

that right now

153
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:29,520
kind of an approach to these sisters we

154
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:31,860
clean your sister by Dyson hair dryer

155
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,510
novice at this hair dryer is probably

156
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:35,690
the most ridiculously prices are in the

what I tell you this is also literally

161
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:45,000
the best hair during the entire rolls

162
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:46,770
I'm not kidding I mean I really wish I

163
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,900
was being paid to tell you that but I

164
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:49,430
can't deny the back so I have two

165
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,860
different tell

166
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:54,320

this car drivers thank God I have a

168
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,860
hairdryer and I have a little rounder

169
00:08:56,149 --> 00:08:59,960

brushing forwards in circular motions

173
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:08,630
and going forward so kind of like makes

174
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:09,140
the her leg do not even saying does this

anymore I'm not sure why because it's

185
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:31,279
really bomb but they do sell solution

186
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:32,450
here one of the least right Aaron is how

187
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,649
I'm gonna do the same exact thing that I

188
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:35,720
do with the hairdryer which is basically

189
00:09:33,649 --> 00:09:38,870
just grabbing little sections one at a

190
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:43,660
time holding my very slowly and pulling

191
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:43,660
it down and forward into a little curl

192
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:49,820
so beautiful now we don't do that so

193
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:51,440
literally my entire what most of my hair

194
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:54,050
it takes I know a lot of work to make it

195
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,430
look like I did no work if that makes

196
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:57,170
any sense but then surely the type of

197
00:09:55,430 --> 00:10:01,820
look that I don't like to go for I'm not

198
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:03,080
going to grab my way not pomade but it's

199
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:04,370
going to rub it together in my hand so

200
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,440
kind of warms up a little bit and gets a

201
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:10,580
little bit more soft as my basically

202
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:12,110
just went like rub it in to my head I

203
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:14,060
definitely to focus most of it in the

204
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:15,860
front of my hair just so making these

205
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:17,750
pieces kind of come down and get texture

206
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:19,400
see how it's like nice and like funky

207
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:21,500
like that and then I put the excess cut

208
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:23,959
it in the back and then going to grab my

209
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:25,550
way of texturizing hairspray there is no

210
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:26,839
way that I could do any original out

211
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:28,790
this basically we're supposed to take a

212
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:31,190
little bit of this I'll see a lot of it

213
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:39,950
I'm kind of like you think bigger swing

214
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:41,839
open up my hair so kind of how my hair

215
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:43,220
you like to kind of keep it this way I'm

216
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,040
gonna grab my last product which is de

217
00:10:43,220 --> 00:11:20,060
got to be glued Paris

218
00:10:46,040 --> 00:11:22,579
okay if you know this is my hair routine

219
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:24,050
complete finally our last step before we

220
00:11:22,579 --> 00:11:26,060
head out of the bathroom back to it the

221
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:27,589
makeup studio without my skincare

222
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,819
routine now of course you might not my

223
00:11:27,589 --> 00:11:31,190
step one before we got into the shower

224
00:11:28,819 --> 00:11:32,870

225
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,459
cleanser and I'm just going to grab my

a minute to you sorry on I do have like

228
00:11:36,589 --> 00:11:39,920
normal skin but I do get very very dry

229
00:11:38,569 --> 00:11:42,110
actually it might be your area when I

230
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,060
get my laser treatments so I love using

231
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:45,860
this after my cleanser after the shower

232
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:47,630
just to get my skin a nice refresh the

233
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:49,279
vitamin C and hydration and it also

234
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:50,269
finally not Lisa following the vitamin C

235
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,250
Sarah what I always like to apply a

236
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:53,779
little bit of moisturizer to really lock

237
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:56,029
everything in place and to complete the

238
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:57,410
routine this is the touch-up do we skin

239
00:11:56,029 --> 00:11:58,370
cream pro tip if you're someone like me

240
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:01,190

241
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:09,050
just use your knuckle it's done super

242
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:11,480
hard to get in there all gross so soft

243
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:13,190
looking at so doing hydrogen I am

244
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,750
obsessed with this I know that's super

245
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,529
super short I given everybody asked for

246
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,089
a skincare routine

247
00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:18,740
there was talking like 100 million

248
00:12:17,089 --> 00:12:20,660
products but I actually believe in

249
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:22,550
quality over quantity though for about a

250
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:24,139
million times on this channel but yeah

251
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:25,639
those are like these four to five

252
00:12:24,139 --> 00:12:27,500
products that I use every single day

253
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:28,610
that really have worked great alright so

254
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,589
you're almost there I'm going to quickly

255
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:31,460
head into it the closet put on the

256
00:12:30,589 --> 00:12:33,050
hoodie and a parent

257
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:35,270
and then I will see you in the sister

258
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:35,960
studio for a quick little no makeup get

259
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,640
rid of me

260
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,990
you're not already sisters so we are

261
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,460
back in the studio that you guys all

262
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:42,110
know and love and recognize from all of

263
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:44,120
our videos but today we are not going to

264
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:45,860
be doing a full glam routine this is

265
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,420
everyone took me like five minutes total

266
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:48,649
super easy in the morning starting off

267
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:50,660
with my base I really did not want any

268
00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:52,070
coverage at all but I do have a few

269
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:54,260
spots that I would like to correct just

270
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:55,550
a little bit my beard area is obviously

271
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:57,020
a little bit great and for some reason

272
00:12:55,550 --> 00:13:00,410
around my lips gets very very like

273
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:01,459
orange right here I don't know why and

274
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:02,870
of course if we all have a little bit of

275
00:13:01,459 --> 00:13:04,700
under eyes and a few blemishes here and

276
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:07,250
there so what I'm going to do is grab

277
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:09,020
just a tiny little bit more of my oyster

278
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:11,390
Iser doesn't matter which one you are

279
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:14,149
using and putting it on the back of my

280
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:16,190
hand just like that and then describing

281
00:13:14,149 --> 00:13:17,270
literally why not squirt of my favorite

282
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:18,440
foundation that this is the Too Faced

283
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:20,270
Born This Way which you guys know I love

284
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:23,029
in the shade nude which is like my

285
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:24,170
closest actual color match usually I go

286
00:13:23,029 --> 00:13:26,060
a little bit more yellow or a little bit

287
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:27,649
darker this is like as close as we're

288
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:29,660
gonna get and just put that right on top

289
00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:31,190
of the moisturizer just like dots that's

290
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:32,930
going to mix them together with my

291
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:34,010
finger on the back of my hand and mixing

292
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:36,140
it together the moisturizer is really

293
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:37,700
going to sheer it out there's gonna do a

294
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:41,660
little bit down here on the mustache

295
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:43,610
area on the sideburns I'm just gonna

296
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:45,350
take a foundation brush and stipple that

297
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:47,600
and and then just super quick with a

298
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:49,250
small powder brush this is the m-52 for

299
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,350
from morphe who's gonna dip into a

300
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:53,630
little bit of the Laura Mercier powder

301
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:55,790
and just put this right in some areas

302
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:56,959
that normally tend to a crease even

303
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,980
though we literally have it nothing on

304
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,360
it this is kind of just like a pro

305
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:01,490
vanity of it just in case any creasing

306
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,360
does decide to show up same thing with

307
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:03,680
the Cylons

308
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,150
once the skin is looking beautiful and

309
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,160
smooth the next I'm gonna do is my

310
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:08,810
eyebrows it's super quickly even on my

311
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,250
no makeup days I do always like my brows

312
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:11,810
to look it's super super snatched I

313
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,190
truly believe the brows afraid in the

314
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:14,720
face and obviously you guys know what

315
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:16,520
they look like before so I definitely

316
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,050
give them very very on fleek squinter

317
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:20,270
got my Anasazi a number 12 brush and a

318
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:22,010
little bit of a dip brow just going to

319
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:23,600
brush the hairs upwards but I'm doing my

320
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:25,190
boy brows I always it start off with the

321
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,450
tail because the tail is kind of the

322
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:28,930
only part that I like to be actually

323
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:30,490
defined just catching that

324
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:32,499
bringing that up but I'm doing my no

325
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:33,639
makeup at brows look I really try hard

326
00:14:32,499 --> 00:14:34,600
to not have to play that with a

327
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,759
concealer because that's when it really

328
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,079
starts looking like faux glam makeup so

329
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:40,809
I'm definitely very very careful during

330
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:43,269
these steps to showing in a tiny little

331
00:14:40,809 --> 00:14:43,930
hairlike strokes and I almost make them

332
00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:47,170
look like

333
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:49,209
bushier then they really are definitely

334
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:51,069
not to the point of like what my 2016

335
00:14:49,209 --> 00:14:53,170
brows used to look like but like I don't

336
00:14:51,069 --> 00:14:54,790
want them to look as tame as they are

337
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:56,199
when I'm glam does this make any sense

338
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:59,709
at all basically I'm going for a very

339
00:14:56,199 --> 00:15:02,410
rugged mask look try a little hairs

340
00:14:59,709 --> 00:15:04,149
little crisscross motions in the

341
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:06,129
directions if they grow and I like that

342
00:15:04,149 --> 00:15:09,610
that's a good there we go that's good

343
00:15:06,129 --> 00:15:11,319
that is such a good brow oh I'm so happy

344
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:16,660
with that yeah okay okay great first

345
00:15:11,319 --> 00:15:18,129
shot I say you're okay no it's gonna do

346
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,389
the same thing on the other eyebrows

347
00:15:18,129 --> 00:15:21,490
what's amazing about this too is that

348
00:15:19,389 --> 00:15:23,319
since I have literally nothing on my

349
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:24,699
face if I make a mistake all I have to

350
00:15:23,319 --> 00:15:26,410
do is just go like that and rub it off

351
00:15:24,699 --> 00:15:28,209
whereas before we have makeup wipes

352
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:29,319
concealer setting powder and a whole lot

353
00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:30,579
of other things to worry about when it

354
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:31,480
comes to fixing now just to lock those

355
00:15:30,579 --> 00:15:33,429
hairs in place I'm gonna grab the

356
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,199
anasazi a dip brow gel in the shade and

357
00:15:33,429 --> 00:15:36,699
medium and brown this is pigmented so

358
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,720
I'm gonna go pretty light with it I'm

359
00:15:36,699 --> 00:15:38,860
just gonna go in and brush these hairs

360
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,809
upwards and then once I get to the

361
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:43,149
middle I'm actually gonna pull them kind

362
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:44,649
of against the way they grow and just so

363
00:15:43,149 --> 00:15:46,089
they kind of left the brows upwards

364
00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:48,009
which not only fills in some areas but

365
00:15:46,089 --> 00:15:49,240
also creates some more texture if

366
00:15:48,009 --> 00:15:50,259
anything does get a little bit messed up

367
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,610
of course you can always grab a little

368
00:15:50,259 --> 00:15:53,769
concealer brush and a little bit of a

369
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:56,319
foundation and just go right over that

370
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:57,279
area too but I really do avoid doing

371
00:15:56,319 --> 00:16:00,279
this because it looks a lot better

372
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:01,899
without but they're looking a little too

373
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:03,279
thick today before we move on to the

374
00:16:01,899 --> 00:16:04,809
next step well I still have my dip brow

375
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,949
gel I want to show you guys a fun little

376
00:16:04,809 --> 00:16:07,389
check that I've been doing a lot

377
00:16:05,949 --> 00:16:09,879
recently and I'm just going to grab my

378
00:16:07,389 --> 00:16:12,399
last curler and start curling my lashes

379
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:14,740
I Pro my last every single day no matter

380
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,660
what I truly feel like curled lashes are

381
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:18,309
so cute on literally everybody

382
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:20,679
especially when boys have like really

383
00:16:18,309 --> 00:16:22,449
really long lashes Oh literally it's so

384
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:25,540
hot and they really just open your eyes

385
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:27,610
and look so adorable so those are my

386
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:30,160
natural lashes feel a little bit kidding

387
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:31,449
me my lashes used to be it so long but

388
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,399
from wearing falsies all the time they

389
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:34,839
get ripped out but like still kind of

390
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:36,429
fun kind of rushed but instead of

391
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:37,360
grabbing a regular mascara because

392
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:38,180
that's gonna look a little bit too

393
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,370
intense or might

394
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:42,470
of days I'm just gonna grab my dip brow

395
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:44,180
gel and I'm going to just kind of brush

396
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:45,260
off any access that may be on the

397
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:47,510
spoolie because they don't want it to be

398
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:49,640
too intense but I'm just going to use a

399
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:52,070
little bit of this and run right through

400
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:54,380
it my lashes to give them a slight coat

401
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:55,700
and a slight lift and this is just gonna

402
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:57,529
make them look a little bit more intense

403
00:16:55,700 --> 00:17:00,170
and a little bit more prominent but not

404
00:16:57,529 --> 00:17:02,000
like you're wearing a full-on lash which

405
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:03,560
I love see it really does make a

406
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,380
difference oh my god like it's a slight

407
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:11,199
difference but it's a pretty difference

408
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:13,730
oh look at my lashes look at my lashes

409
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,959
all right sisters we're almost done one

410
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:16,490
of my favorite things that I like to do

411
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,290
when I'm not wearing a full glam makeup

412
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:19,910
look is freckles

413
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:21,709
I feel like freckles are so beautiful

414
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:23,300
they're so youthful they make it look

415
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:25,040
like I am being sunkissed as opposed to

416
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,929
sitting inside and working and filming

417
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,700
all day long and I love how I look in

418
00:17:26,929 --> 00:17:30,559
them to do them I always got my Anasazi

419
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:32,270
at dipper hotel literally once again in

420
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:35,000
the shade Auburn and I'm just going to

421
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:37,250
grab a small little pencil brush like

422
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,840
this one this is just the e36 for morphe

423
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:40,190
and I go in and I just kind of like

424
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,960
wiggle the brush around a little bit

425
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:43,429
just to get some pigment on there and I

426
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,950
always go in on the back of my hand and

427
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:47,690
just rub off any excess and then I'll

428
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:49,010
literally just go in and start off with

429
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:52,190
the freckle layer but I kind of just

430
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:54,200
like watching this around my cheek

431
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:56,000
region I am going to add a little

432
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,830
freckled off in a second but this kind

433
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,470
of just lays down a little like

434
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:03,290
sunkissed base area and then grabbing a

435
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:04,760
little liner brush this into E 37 and my

436
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:06,679
two different dip brow shades

437
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,240
a burn and a medium brown I'm just going

438
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:09,380
to add tiny little freckles I'm just

439
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,270
using different pressures when applying

440
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,830
these freckles to some pressing a really

441
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:14,600
really hard and some barely even

442
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:16,100
touching my skin just to kind of create

443
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,980
different shapes and colors and sizes

444
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:20,809
because not all freckles are the same

445
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:22,460
and I'm just concentrating the most and

446
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:24,290
the darkest dots right in this X Center

447
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:26,000
nose area and fading them out as they go

448
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:27,380
towards the outside of my face now this

449
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,940
is definitely optional but you guys know

450
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,570
personally I like to look very very dewy

451
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,920
and glowy

452
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:32,450
so I'm just going to grab the James

453
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:34,300
Charles X morphe palette and literally

454
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:36,700
the tiniest

455
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:38,050
of face the highlighter shade from the

456
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:43,420
palette and I'm just gonna use it this

457
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:46,210
to put a subtle glow on the skin just

458
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:48,130
like that Oh gorgeous a little bit on

459
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:50,710
the chin and using that excess right

460
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:55,059
above the eyebrows just for some natural

461
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:58,120
radiance inner corners and then last but

462
00:18:55,059 --> 00:18:59,980
not least a little bit on the brow bone

463
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:02,020
when it comes to highlighting for these

464
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:03,400
looks I actually like to skip out on the

465
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:05,290
nose highlight just because when my face

466
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,480
does get oily my nose is always the

467
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:08,980
first thing to turn into a kind of slip

468
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,120
and slide so I'm not gonna put any

469
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,770
highlighter on there just to kind of

470
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,750
keep it looking at natural give my face

471
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:15,640
a quick spritz of the mac's fix+

472
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:18,970
in the shade gold white which is like

473
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:20,050
it's like shiny fix+ it just has a tiny

474
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:21,640
little bit of shimmer in it which is

475
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:24,160
really going to add to that natural dewy

476
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,870
type of look my skin is like absolute

477
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,700
glowing and this looks so beautiful

478
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:29,770
right now and last the finally not least

479
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,790
I'm going to grab a makeup wipe and

480
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:32,950
clean out the back of my hands that I

481
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:35,380
was using as a palette and then just use

482
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:37,900
this to go right into my lips and

483
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:39,730
carefully clean up my lip line and last

484
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,410
but finally not least just to keep my

485
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:44,380
lips hydrated all day long I'm gonna pop

486
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:48,100
on a little tiny bit of the Fenty beauty

487
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:49,929
of gloss balm I love this gloss and it

488
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:53,350
is very very moisturizing and hydrating

489
00:19:49,929 --> 00:19:54,790
which is perfect for this type of look

490
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:57,670
well they love being said it is

491
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:59,410

00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:04,240
