00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
hi sisters James Turrell Sood welcome

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:07,020
back it's my youtube channel if you're

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,480
thinking wow James you look not good I

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,130
would be thinking yes it's currently

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,599
6:00 in the morning and I just rolled

6
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,820
out of bed and sat down I filmed a video

7
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:17,220
after going to bed at 4 a.m. last night

8
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,590
filming a video so that's um fun and

9
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,390
fresh today I'm doing something crazy

10
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:24,930
that I'm actually very very very nervous

11
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:27,420
for and I am going to tell you about

12
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:29,400
that throughout the year in the beauty

13
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,800
community we have a few huge major

14
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,030
events called beauty conventions there's

15
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,829
a lot of them that go by different names

16
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,450
but overall they have the same kind of

17
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:38,640
purpose of connecting smaller

18
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,800
influencers and big brands to allow them

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,719
to network together sell products do

20
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,860
demos do classes for influencers to make

21
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,450
appearances and they're usually pretty

22
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,280
fun I remember a few years ago and I had

23
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,559
only 50,000 followers begging and

24
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,230
pleading my parents let me use all of my

25
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:53,850
saved up money to fly to California to

26
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,670
go to generation Beauty I had followers

27
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,680
but no fans yet no brands had any idea

28
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:02,070
who I was no influences knew who I was I

29
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,930
remember my makeup looked literally the

30
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,309
absolute worst and as my first time

31
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,350
meeting all the major influencers I

32
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:08,520
snuck into the crater cocktail party so

33
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,710
I got to meet so many people and take

34
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,330
photos and it was honestly such a cool

35
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:15,450
experience and it's also the first time

36
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,830
that ever got on PR list because of you

37
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,600
guys know and how fast this sisterhood

38
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,750
is growing I don't really go to beauty

39
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,850
conventions that often anymore for a lot

40
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,960
of reasons but spoiler alert I'm going

41
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,310
to win today so I'm going to keep those

42
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,939
reasons to myself because I don't wanna

43
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,740
get yelled at

44
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:29,820
after this video even though I

45
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,770
personally choose to not go to these

46
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,299
conventions much anymore it has been

47
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,040
several years since I've attended one

48
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:36,299
the industry is ever-changing and it's

49
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,290
been a very very long time since I've

50
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:39,270
been able to interact with fans

51
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,400
different Beauty influencer people

52
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,780
different brands and I'm kind of curious

53
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,090
as to how these conventions are running

54
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,619
are they going smoothly after Tana Khan

55
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,240
I feel like anything would be going

56
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:49,979
smoothly in comparison to that but I

57
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,180
really want to get the inside scoop see

58
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:52,710
how people are feeling about the

59
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,880
industry right now who they like who

60
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:57,090
they don't like what brands they like

61
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:59,399
which brands they don't like so for

62
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:01,619
today's video I thought I'd doing this a

63
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,229
few weeks ago and I can't believe this

64
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:06,180
is actually coming to life but I hired

65
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:07,469
an extremely talented special effects

66
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,160
artists you guys are going to me in a

67
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:13,310
few short minutes and today I am get

68
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,470
fully professionally transformed into a

69
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:17,600
completely different human being and I'm

70
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:20,780
going to be sneaking into beautycon and

71
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:27,740

00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:29,240
makeup industry you guys I'd like to

73
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:31,700

00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:43,580
because this is a huge transformation

78
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:46,520
John explained like briefly what we're

79
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:49,570
really doing okay so James contacted me

80
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:52,670
for this super secret sister makeover

81
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:55,070
and he basically wanted to be in

82
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:57,560
disguise to go to beauty con yes and we

83
00:02:55,070 --> 00:03:01,100
decided to do something like an older 30

84
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:03,260
year-old male very masculine so he's

85
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:05,210
gonna have a beard he's gonna have

86
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:08,540
facial features that change with the

87
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:11,060
prosthetics he's going to have a wig on

88
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:14,780
we'll do something with the brows will

89
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:16,670
change wardrobe and he will be a new man

90
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:18,080
oh my god

91
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:20,510
how long would you this process is gonna

92
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,610
take usually special effects makeup

93
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:24,560
artists have like three or four people

94
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:27,200
working on one person they still can

95
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:31,190
take up to five hours five to six hours

96
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:35,060
eight hours the more pieces the longer

97
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:35,750
it takes to apply how many pieces do you

98
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,790
have today

99
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:39,170
um I think we have five what do you

100
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:40,790
think it's gonna be the hardest aspect

101
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:44,870
of it successfully pulling off this

102
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:47,510
sister secret surprise I would say your

103
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:49,940
face but we have that under control yeah

104
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:51,950
that's girls have it covered yes I think

105
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:53,720
the next biggest challenge would be just

106
00:03:51,950 --> 00:04:02,209
staying in character and keeping your

107
00:03:53,720 --> 00:04:04,190
mannerisms in check yeah oh yeah I'm

108
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:05,660
gonna have to say hey guys for all the

109
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:08,510
clips today which is gonna be a

110
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:12,320
challenge already I have to really focus

111
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:14,690
on slowing my words down I also have to

112
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:19,850
try to go from being like a 98 percent

113
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:21,710
gay man to a like roughly 32% gay man or

114
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:23,190
I'm out we already went ahead and took

115
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:26,040
off all my jewelry earlier on

116
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:31,080
which was very emotionally hard for me

117
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:33,060
oh she stuck oh oh hello hey take off my

118
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,710
cardi doesn't look I can never do this

119
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,780
with nails this limb you didn't have to

120
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:38,310
use a screwdriver for so please don't

121
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:40,620
ever try to rob me or cut my hand off on

122
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:43,200
the streets because even if you do you

123
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,000

145
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,070
coincidentally as well this week has

146
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,560
also been one of the most stressful of

147
00:05:56,070 --> 00:06:00,510
my entire life so I may or may not have

148
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,800
bitten off all of my acrylic nails which

149
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:03,930
is actually great for this video because

150
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:08,850
I think that may be a very intense

151
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:09,990
giveaway I'll give you go down well I

152
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:11,520
have a million questions that I want to

153
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:12,900
ask you tanning I am so sated for this

154
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,720
food today I think you are so talented

155
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:17,700
and I'm putting my face in your hands

156
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,020
I'm very very nervous I'm not even gonna

157
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:21,240
lie it not because I don't trust you

158
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:22,890
because I don't trust myself so we have

159
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,350
five hours ahead of us I think we need

160
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:26,730
to buckle up get ready to go get ready

161
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:29,730
to his sister's secret surprise

162
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:31,750
everybody and should we get started on

163
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:33,860
this transformation

164
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,910
so a few nights ago Channing came over

165
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:39,229
to my apartment for the first time ever

166
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:42,650
and made a life cast a life cast of my

167
00:06:39,229 --> 00:06:44,780
face which was um probably hmm

168
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:47,150
one of the scariest and worst hours of

169
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:48,830
my entire life but they're doing that

170
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:50,930
she was able to actually make a full

171
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:53,120
plate of a wonderful prosthetics that

172
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:54,229
are gonna be glued on and we'll roll the

173
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,580
footage right now and show you guys how

174
00:06:54,229 --> 00:06:56,810
that process went because I'm sure

175
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,069
you're just going to love watching these

176
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:09,050
suckers walk us through your process

177
00:06:58,069 --> 00:07:10,190
like what are we doing I am looking

178
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:20,120
right at home look like at West

179
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:21,740
Hollywood trash can it's silicone body

180
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,870
double it's what I'm gonna use to laughs

181
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:25,400
cast him it'll come free from like all

182
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:27,800
his hair I don't have to use a release

183
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:30,139
and it's it's a lot quicker and it lasts

184
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,810
a lot longer so if James wants to make

185
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:35,630
multiple life casts of himself he can

186
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:37,719
this is very good cover no guys please

187
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:38,990
try not to make me laugh once I explain

188
00:07:37,719 --> 00:07:43,419
okay

189
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:43,419
it kind of feels like cold oh my god

190
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:47,030
I'm getting claustrophobic just looking

191
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,930
at you these might be the best 30

192
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:49,930
minutes in my entire life

193
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:58,350
we can legit talk about him and him not

194
00:07:54,120 --> 00:08:00,690
even talk back to us so after this I

195
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:03,690
will take it and I'm gonna pour a stone

196
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:06,030
in it that we use to make live cast and

197
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:08,490
from there I'll start sculpting the

198
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:11,160
prosthetic pieces and from that I'll

199
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:13,290
make a mold of those and I'll pour them

200
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:16,320
in more silicone and then they'll be

201
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:17,340
ready to go on oh that's so weird I

202
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,020
don't like that I feel like that's

203
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:37,770
really squishy and I hope the sister

204
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:39,750
slice under James's nose okay so now I'm

205
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:43,680
gonna take plaster bandages and make a

206
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:46,380
shell for the silicone mold and it just

207
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,720
protects it yes so this is the hardest

208
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:52,020
part of doing it cuz now it's gonna be

209
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,570
stiff where he can't move at all and I'm

210
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:56,880
sure he feels it like the difference do

211
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:58,860
you feel genius warm it's warm you can

212
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,780
feel it he's heard me knock on him like

213
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:07,320
20 times now but I'm making sure it's

214
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:11,480
okay hmm

215
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,480
wait now start moving your face around

216
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,360
this is your face really beautiful

217
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,770
no what's the dot by Dudley was like

218
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:29,180
very uncomfortable especially with like

219
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:31,850
everybody's saying funny things I want

220
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:34,460
to laugh so bad but it wasn't like pop

221
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:39,080
up so I'm gonna start by cleansing the

222
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:41,900
skin to get rid of any dirt oil all of

223
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:45,800
those things stops from sticking and

224
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:47,630
then I'm taking a skin protectant to put

225
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:50,030
on you it's gonna be like damaging to my

226
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:52,640
skin at all no if you remove it

227
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:55,730
correctly then it's totally safe

228
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:58,040
a lot of fun so yes starting out I'm

229
00:09:55,730 --> 00:10:01,190
using pros aid transfers which are kind

230
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:03,650
of like the same as tattoos you wet the

231
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:05,810
back of the paper like literally a

232
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:11,510
temporary tattoo and then you just blend

233
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:13,480
the edges off with alcohol for head well

234
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:15,800
you have a lot of space to work with

235
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:19,240
so what like are you interested in

236
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,240
special effects like in the first place

237
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:31,460
and the tricks that they pull love that

238
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:33,710
for you or less yes yeah I feel like the

239
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:35,480
lot so if you a definite giveaway most

240
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:37,460
30 year-old straight men don't exactly

241
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:42,770
have a viola Juvederm until floods but

242
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:44,030
you know what we're not judging here wow

243
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:47,150
I look like I just gave a really good

244
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:49,400
sister stock since the designs are so

245
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:52,250
small you may not think that like

246
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:54,260
they'll do much yeah to the overall look

247
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:56,360
but once you see it come together you'll

248
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:59,480
realize like oh it took that little

249
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:01,550
amount mm-hmm to change a feature uh-huh

250
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,990
this is low-key really relaxing I don't

251
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:04,190
want to fall asleep research any you're

252
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:05,150
saying you loved horror movies that's

253
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:06,740
kind of what you got you know special

254
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:08,610
effects what are some of your favorite

255
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:11,339
horror movies that you've seen

256
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:12,870
I love all the Saw movies I figured you

257
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:15,870
would like those yeah yeah it's just

258
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:18,180
like the thing that inspires me is the

259
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:20,370
fact that you can literally just take

260
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:23,550
someone a regular human and turn them

261
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:25,680
into this like creature this monster so

262
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:28,140
now I'm going to take silicon

263
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:31,820
encapsulated pieces and apply them to

264
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:33,149
James I'm gonna start with his chin Oh

265
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,980
God

266
00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:37,050
so these are the pieces that Channing

267
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:41,209
came over a few days ago to premake oh I

268
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:46,140
know you're not giving me a double

269
00:11:41,209 --> 00:11:49,740
chattering bruda just kind of like with

270
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:52,079
the pros aid transfers these blend off

271
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:53,490
with alcohol as well well probably the

272
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,810
first and only time alcohol will be

273
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:58,070
featured on the James Charles YouTube

274
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:58,070
channel I'm a sober sister

275
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:03,329
my butt chin has gone oh now know about

276
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:10,410
of jaw clenching her face didn't can fix

277
00:12:03,329 --> 00:12:13,949
this that's my worst nightmare Oh No

278
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:15,930
oh my god you've got to be kidding me

279
00:12:13,949 --> 00:12:22,800
so Channing how long did you actually go

280
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:25,320
to cosmetic school for but they take you

281
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,190
through everything so quickly which i

282
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:30,470
think is a good thing

283
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:32,279
yeah are you a fast learner I am same

284
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:33,779
that was my biggest thing in school

285
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:35,100
would be like I would learn the lesson

286
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:36,930
once and then they'd keep going through

287
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:40,610
it and reviewing and I was like oh my

288
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:43,350
god so now I'm gonna put on cheek pieces

289
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:45,269
for James what is this gonna do to the

290
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:47,459
jawline of my cheekbones and it's gonna

291
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:49,620
round it off it's not gonna be as

292
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:50,910
structured okay out of all the things

293
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:53,490
that you've learned how to do what's

294
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:56,190
been your hardest like transformation or

295
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:57,200
like special effect yeah I'm so in

296
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:59,839
school

297
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:02,810
in the special effects class we have to

298
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:06,440
like sculpt and make our own monster and

299
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:07,730
that was probably the hardest thing that

300
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:10,970
I've ever done

301
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:14,209
really yeah cuz start to finish it was

302
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:16,610
like a four week process for weeks holy

303
00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:19,639
crop everything in school is pretty much

304
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:21,440
like that I kind of rather than be that

305
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:23,449
way because I think it just prepares you

306
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,430
more how would you compare like this

307
00:13:23,449 --> 00:13:26,300
transformation type to like the stuff

308
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,560
that you're doing in school like the

309
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,139
monster Soph

310
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:32,240
[Music]

311
00:13:29,139 --> 00:13:35,240
this is more difficult in the fact that

312
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,459
it's like realism right a monster you

313
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:40,519
can just be like as creative and crazy

314
00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:43,790
as you want this is like all about

315
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:45,649
making sure you paint it right making

316
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:53,570
sure your edges are blended really

317
00:13:45,649 --> 00:13:55,940
nicely so this is harder whoa I don't

318
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:57,740
know why I'm so nervous for this hello

319
00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:00,880
everybody my name is Tom and welcome to

320
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:03,589
Beauty Cod that's not like a man no

321
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:07,610
that's still okay I could be a really

322
00:14:03,589 --> 00:14:10,279
gay bad it bros its mark question right

323
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:16,130
now and let's see do both and pretend

324
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:17,570
that you're asking a question hey who

325
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:18,769
would you say your favorite influencers

326
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:20,810
and Oh No

327
00:14:18,769 --> 00:14:22,279
who would you say right now are your

328
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:24,310
favorite influencers in the beauty

329
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:26,570
community and who is your least favorite

330
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:27,720
that still sounded like me huh

331
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:29,519
I love this

332
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,569
have a pop in the middle I face I think

333
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:35,610
this is the finished look right here

334
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:37,589
guys so right now I'm taking bondo which

335
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:39,750
is just like a thickened adhesive to

336
00:14:37,589 --> 00:14:42,060
help blend the edges of the prosthetic

337
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:43,410
into the skin better so is this like the

338
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:45,240
final set before we get to the painting

339
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:46,350
yeah okay guys we just had breakfast and

340
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,970
we are back and we're ready to start

341
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:50,430
painting this is where actually it gets

342
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:54,660
like real and it starts to like look

343
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:57,209
like a real person hello hi and I took

344
00:14:54,660 --> 00:15:00,300
my wig off because Mama's hot and she's

345
00:14:57,209 --> 00:15:02,550
working love okay so now I'm gonna start

346
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:04,170
painting with alcohol paints and the

347
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:07,949
reason why we use alcohol paints is

348
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:10,649
because there's still translucent so it

349
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:12,810
makes it look like skin like you're not

350
00:15:10,649 --> 00:15:14,970
taking a bunch of product on you can

351
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:16,379
still have translucency with it so how

352
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:19,740
many layers of paint would you typically

353
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:22,889
do for this you just build them up until

354
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:27,240
it gets to like a skin tone type of base

355
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:31,100
like it's a multiple layered thing like

356
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,100
you can't just go in one or two layers

357
00:15:44,949 --> 00:15:52,670
so now I'm going to take the beer that I

358
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:56,509
made and apply it with spirit gum I'm so

359
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:58,990
not gonna be a bad I'm so excited I'm

360
00:15:56,509 --> 00:15:58,990
gonna be a bad

361
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:40,910
oh my god hey brothers what's my name

362
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:43,610

00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:02,490
but some bros welcome to beauty con ha

418
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:04,350
ha ha

419
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:06,900
Cruz like your favorite influencer right

420
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:12,480
now I love James Charles it's pretty

421
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:13,920
funny we're on the way right now to

422
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,170
beautycon and I'm not even gonna lie

423
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:19,170
like I'm feeling really really nervous

424
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:20,880
right now I never ever get nervous to

425
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:22,200
like be in front of people but I think

426
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,690
I'm nervous because like this is not

427
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:27,090
like me I'd have to like ah I'd have to

428
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:29,700
like play a part I guess I'm just

429
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:32,430
confirmed because I really want to see

430
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,840
the sisters and stuff but it can like

431
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:36,630
these conventions can be a major safety

432
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,190
hazard and I'm just praying that we

433
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:39,720
don't get caught because if we do it's

434
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:41,310
literally over and this whole entire

435
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,500
thing is ruined at this point I think

436
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:45,270
Channing did literally such a phenomenal

437
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,010
job I don't think it's gonna be the face

438
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:49,230
that's gonna be an issue if anything I

439
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:51,990
think it'll be the voice or like if I

440
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:55,100
slip up on my man voice or like my

441
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:58,200
mannerisms I speak with my hands so much

442
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:59,760
like so so so much my stomach kind of

443
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,710
feels like right now and I think it's

444
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,090
because I'm getting the feeling of how I

445
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:05,550
used to get when I first went to these

446
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:06,810
conventions as if I'm not important

447
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:08,010
because there's me a million people

448
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:09,180
there and it's like it's very

449
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:10,650
overwhelming they're always very very

450
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,820
crowded and very very packed and like

451
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:13,020
everybody's super stater to see the

452
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,940
people that they love and the brands

453
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:16,620
they love but normally now when I can

454
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,150
walk into an event or a convention I

455
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:19,860
have a full team of people around me

456
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:21,450
that are protecting me that are making

457
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:23,670
sure I'm led to the right places getting

458
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:25,410
like you know what I mean like I'm very

459
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:27,800
coordinated at these type of events and

460
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:29,700
this were literally walking in of course

461
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,290
hopefully they won't be able to see it's

462
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:33,090
me but it's still kind of like that same

463
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,740
feeling of like oh I don't really know

464
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:35,670
what is gonna happen I'm not really sure

465
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:38,190
how that's gonna go if I'm being

466
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:40,110
completely honest I'm just a little bit

467
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:41,010
nervous I just want this to go well we

468
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:42,810
just got here we have to find the

469
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:44,120
entrance now I don't really know where

470
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:46,070
we're going

471
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:48,840
I'm very scared I'm gonna be honest but

472
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:51,640
let's get this over with

473
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:54,230
