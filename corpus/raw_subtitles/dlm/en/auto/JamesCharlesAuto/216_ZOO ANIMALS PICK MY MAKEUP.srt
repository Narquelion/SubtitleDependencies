welcome back to my youtube channel first

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,120
today's YouTube video we were doing

4
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:08,099
something so much fun that I'm actually

5
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,809
really really pumped for him right now

6
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:11,639
going around there's a huge trend where

7
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:13,559
people are having their dogs and their

8
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:14,790
cats pick their makeup I believe that

9
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:16,440
Jake kiss was the first ones to do this

10
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,820
when she had her dog pick her makeup

11
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,199
I know nikkietutorials did a video I

12
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,760
know a few people had their cats picked

13
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,670
her makeup and yes all these videos are

14
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:26,519

a task and that is for sure the full

92
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,850
mangoes were definitely not wanting to

94
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:23,890
morning I don't blame them I really had

95
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:25,959
to be one with the flamingos in order to

96
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:27,430
get them to recognize me to trust me to

97
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:29,500
appreciate me and to help me actually

98
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:30,610
choose the foundation and luckily Potter

99
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,290
though the lingo was nice enough in the

100
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,430
end and he ended up choosing the Too

101
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:34,720
Faced Born This Way Foundation that you

102
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,820
guys know this is my all-time favorites

103
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,080
so Potter definitely has good taste

104
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:40,180
and I was gonna go ahead and apply this

105
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,400
and his recommendation you guys meeting

106
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:44,230
these flamingos was literally so much

107
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,940
fun and such a good first step of this

108
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:47,019
video they were all so funny and

109
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,700
everything one of them was named after

110
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:50,680
Harry Potter character and if you know

111
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:52,900
me I literally grew up being the biggest

112
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,100
Harry Potter Stan ever I went to all the

113
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,140
movies at the midnight premiere is there

114
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:58,000
like my all-time favorites so getting to

115
00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:00,250
walk around with Hermione and Potter and

116
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,490
Weasley just really made my morning but

117
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,960
I will say they were definitely not

118
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:05,760
giving me the time of day at first I

119
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,410
really had to work pretty hard to get

120
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,900
them to trust me and to accept me into

121
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:11,040
their squad of flamingoes but once they

122
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,450
finally did it they were so much fun

123
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,830
that we were just working around with

124
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:15,270
them for a real one I was really

125
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:17,640
surprised because all the fooling those

126
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:18,900
were very much like kind of white really

127
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,790
really light pink and all the babies

128
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,800
were gray and I was like what the hawk

129
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:24,600
these do not look like flamingos but

130
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,280
apparently flamingos actually don't get

131
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,320
their full-on bright pink color until

132
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,760
they're around three years of age and it

133
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,040
actually comes from the food they we

134
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,600
learned that like backwards leg that the

135
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,310
flamingos have isn't actually their knee

136
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,170
where you'd think it would be it's

137
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:39,270
actually their ankle so their legs are

138
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:40,740
like weird and I don't know if you guys

139
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:42,060
have ever picked up on this or noticed

140
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:44,070
this but if you ever look at a video of

141
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:46,770
me standing or if you meet me in person

142
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:48,780
my legs are always crossed no matter

143
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:51,270
what if I'm standing still my legs are

144
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,710
100% out like a weird tea angle and it's

145
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:54,390
because I have scoliosis of all my hips

146
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:55,410
is higher than the other one but I just

147
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,700
thought it was so funny because I've

148
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:58,950
been made fun about my entire life

149
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:01,530
flamingos sisters I feel you we can just

150
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:03,060
be weird standing people together

151
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:04,890
alright sister so thanks for the

152
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,210
flamingos our foundation is all on and

153
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:11,910
ready to go and our next that was going

154
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:14,520
to be our concealer oh my god she's so

155
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:16,530
fluffy okay guys so this is all of it

156
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,210
the porcupine and we're gonna be having

157
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:20,130
her choose between up my two concealers

158
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:22,080
today can't Pat her a because it will

159
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:24,360
hurt the most that's right so she has

160
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,240
some really really long quills they're

161
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,620
all underneath that outside whoa and

162
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,660
then she can shoot those out right

163
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:33,180
though she can't shoot it out she can't

164
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:35,100
throw it something actually has to touch

165
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:42,870
it and their guard so when they stick to

166
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:46,170
something pull away really oh my god all

167
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:48,090
I'm saying i sister know how sharp are

168
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:50,160
the actual quills they're very sharp she

169
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:51,740
sheds them like regular hair so it's

170
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,970
like the worst house cat in the world

171
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:55,250
when you accidentally sit down on them

172
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:57,530
accidentally pull yourself there barb so

173
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:59,540
once they're in they actually have

174
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:01,100
microscopic Barb's and they'll expand

175
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,330
and make it hard for them to come out

176
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:05,090
they actually will only move in one

177
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:07,490
direction and that's in so they'll

178
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:09,500
actually move all the way through the

179
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:12,380
animal that they quill so it's a really

180
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:16,130
bad day for anything that decides to try

181
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:20,840
and eat a porcupine yeah so definitely

182
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:22,580
not having myself oh my god totally this

183
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,560
is a MUFON video Trisha Paytas is

184
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,700
shaking all of us coming for her career

185
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,990
ended over

186
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:33,170
I almost an all at the porcupine

187
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:35,780
tomorrow to listen to that okay let's

188
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:36,770
have her pick yeah okay guys so for

189
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,150
concealer so that we have our two

190
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:39,770
different options being the Tarts tape

191
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:41,540
tape and then also the color pop no

192
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:42,590
filter concealer I'm a huge fan of both

193
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:44,630
of these so regardless of whatever

194
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:46,550
sister olive picks I'll be happy but

195
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:48,380
they will definitely change how the base

196
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:50,090
actually looks on camera so let's see

197
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:52,220
what sister all of us preferring today

198
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:55,310
for our shoes right now which one do you

199
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:56,510
want oh oh my god

200
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,920
looks like I'll have picked the color

201
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:59,480
pop no filter concealer we don't even

202
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,440
have to bribe her with some food so look

203
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,930
so we're gonna be getting glam B's in

204
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,340
the color pop no filter concealer thanks

205
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:06,020
always all right guys so all of the

206
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,400
porcupine chose the color pop and no

207
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:09,080
filter concealer today I'm gonna be

208
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,030
using the shade a fair and number five

209
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:14,000
just to highlight the inner parts of my

210
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:14,990
face and literally olive was so nice I

211
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,540
was little bit nervous to meet a

212
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:19,220
porcupine but she was literally so sweet

213
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:21,230
and so fluffy like she looked so cute

214
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,820
that I wanted to touch her but the

215
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,750
zookeeper said probably shouldn't do

216
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,160
that unless you want to get sister

217
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,780
stabbed well what I didn't realize is

218
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,730
that those white spikes were not

219
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:31,520
actually her spikes they're part of her

220
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:33,950
fur and all the spikes are like inside

221
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,480
of the fur and really kind of hidden so

222
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:37,400
she looks soft and fluffy and nice and

223
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,170
fine and fresh but you get to host her

224
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,030
and she's sister stabs of you and then

225
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:42,740
you die which is just lovely and fine

226
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:45,320
what I did not know and I actually found

227
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:47,030
so funny is that apparently porcupines

228
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:49,040
are considered the lordís of rodent in

229
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:51,860
North America first of all I thought

230
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:53,570
that was me I'm so funny

231
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:55,460
I did not know that they were part of

232
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:55,820
the rodent family is the fun fact of the

233
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,170
day

234
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,390
contrary to popular belief as well

235
00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:00,610
because I asked this quest

236
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:04,300
and porcupines can't shoot their quills

237
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:05,890
which maybe you'd know but I did not I

238
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,900
thought that if a porcupine was like the

239
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:09,700
right hand it could have sister shoot

240
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:11,710
out their quills and like aim at their

241
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,820
prey and get them good but that's

242
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:14,320
definitely not the case at all it

243
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,680
actually has to make a physical contact

244
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,900
and

245
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,340
the quill that goes in the skin and then

246
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,870
like opens up so it you can't really

247
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:23,110
pull it out and you can only go further

248
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:24,010
and then it kills them this is getting

249
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:27,070
dark really fast

250
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:29,410
point-blank being don't get caught by

251
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:30,760
porcupine is the moral of story but all

252
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:32,170
of us really nice to find in brush and

253
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,790
our concealer is done so we have our

254
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:35,320
whole based on looking at so beautiful

255
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:38,470
I've actually not used this combination

256
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,880
in a very long time and I am loving how

257
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:41,230
this is looking so far so I'm super

258
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,390
super excited these animals definitely

259
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:44,770
have really really great taste but we

260
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:46,480
need to work fast and set this in place

261
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:48,130
so let's find a speedy and energetic

262
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,690
animal to help us out sister so we're

263
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:51,550
currently in the petting zoo and we have

264
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:52,750
our goat here sets our Poncho's gonna

265
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:54,520
help us choose a setting powder today

266
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:56,590
we're choosing between the RCM a no

267
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:58,120
color powder and the coverfx powder I'm

268
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:59,650
a little bit over sosam because this one

269
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,700
is not my favor I've tried this before

270
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:02,200
and it gives me flash like Mary

271
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:04,270
sometimes and this powder I have not

272
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:06,490
tried I've heard of great things but you

273
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:07,780
never know so I have some carrots to

274
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:09,550
incentivize them and to say a little

00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:13,270

277
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:14,080
decided for us I love him he's gonna

278
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:15,820
come home with me

279
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,470
Pelle part of the glam squad team sister

carrot oh he wants ball ok locally we're

286
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:40,120
gonna be using the cover of X powder

287
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:41,860
today thanks Pancho alright guys so

288
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,510
punch of the goat was so excited to help

289
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,650
us out today he was literally so sweet

290
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,950
love him the most ever in the entire

291
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,240
world

292
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:48,460
I think I probably need to adopt a pet

293
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,410
goat right now and he chose the coverfx

294
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:51,820
powder and I was gonna use this and the

295
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:53,290
shade light does it my face in place

296
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:55,270
today honestly probably my favorite fact

297
00:09:53,290 --> 00:10:00,640
of the entire day is that goats can

298
00:09:55,270 --> 00:10:02,620
spend up to 14 hours a day eating mood

299
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,880
hello that is me I also thought it was

300
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05,380
really cool too because the goats were

301
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,840
in a like petting zoo so a lot of the

302
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,950
kids can actually go in and

303
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,020
they're one of the few animals that you

304
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:11,130
can really interact with at the zoo and

305
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,630
although you can actually go in and pet

306
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:14,640
the goats and feed them they had

307
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:16,500
actually a roped-off area inside of

308
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,360
their pen that if the goats are feeling

309
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,290
overwhelmed or tired or just bored and

310
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,390
don't want to talk to people anymore

311
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:22,529
they can just go in the robes and then

312
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:26,430
you can't touch them

313
00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:27,720
I need that at all times hello also -

314
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:29,339
one thing that I noticed when I was

315
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,500
closed up with poncho feeding him is

316
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:34,470
that goats actually have a rectangular

317
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:36,720
pupil in their eyeball and because of

318
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:38,700
this they actually have a 330 degree

319
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,650
like peripheral vision and meaning that

320
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,990
they can see almost entirely around them

321
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:44,790
without having to move their heads hello

322
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:46,170
that is the coolest thing ever can you

323
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:48,690
imagine how many fun things we could do

324
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:50,550
if we could see 330° around us like you

325
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:56,400
could sister spot straight boys from all

326
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:58,080
angles you could that's a little matters

327
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,580
honestly or I guess if you're a goat you

328
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,470
can like spot predators but then again

329
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,970
spotting straight boys far more fun

330
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:04,320
alright guys sorry face it's all set in

331
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:07,110
place and locked in everybody needs to

332
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,300
go it is literally a trillion degrees in

333
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:11,160
Los Angeles today I am sister sweating

334
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:13,230
it for a real one so they got we have a

335
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,430
lot of powder but now we need to contour

336
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:16,650
because we're looking a little bit flat

337
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:18,540
so let's see how we can really chisel

338
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:19,530
out our face and look nice and sculpted

339
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,970
hey girl

340
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:22,290
we're here with the draw sister sister

341
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:24,420
Athena and today she's gonna be choosing

342
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:26,430
our bronzer / contour so we have the

343
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,740
next Pro contouring palette and also the

344
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:29,790
Too Faced chocolate Soleil bronzer

345
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:31,110
giraffes remember the species people

346
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,820
don't think about as being endangered

347
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:34,530
because we have a lot of pictures of

348
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:37,230
them you can kind of imagine that

349
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:38,910
they're really ubiquitous in Africa but

350
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:40,110
a lot of them their populations are

351
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:42,030
shrinking because their habitats are

352
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:43,890
shrinking so that's why every baby born

353
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:46,470
at the zoo is a really good

354
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:48,269
really good news for species oh my god

355
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:49,920
the way giraffe society kind of works is

356
00:11:48,269 --> 00:11:53,640
that the biggest strongest guy gets a

357
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:55,500
group of ladies to be his so we've got

358
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:58,640
one adult male in here Philip and he's

359
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:01,649
got two adult females that are his

360
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:03,360
girlfriend so to speak one adult female

361
00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:05,130
that he's kind of interested in and then

362
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,680
learning to giraffes that are there are

363
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:08,910
his babies his kids sounds like me with

364
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,500
all the Instagram hot boys that I've

365
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:11,130
comment on their photos multiple

366
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:16,610
boyfriends

367
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:22,320
okay sister which one do you want Oh oh

368
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:24,240
my god okay Wow what's that tongue do

369
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,860
looks like a Cena chose of the Knicks a

370
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,510
pro contouring palette all right sisters

371
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:30,060
so after much deliberation and much

372
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:31,890
bribery a senior the giraffe finally

373
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:33,120
ended up picking the next pro contour

374
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:34,260
palette I'm a huge fan of this product

375
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,940
else I really loved the Too Faced

376
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:37,470
bronzer as well so he's done was

377
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:39,540
definitely gonna be a winner but let's

378
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:40,709
go ahead and contour our face it was so

379
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,720
cool learning about the drafts today

380
00:12:40,709 --> 00:12:44,730
they were literally all so beautiful and

381
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,200
just so like majestic which sounds so

382
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:48,449
weird to say but I did not know that

383
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,890
giraffes are actually on the verge of

384
00:12:48,449 --> 00:12:51,480
being endangered right now they're

385
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:52,529
definitely considered vulnerable which

386
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,910
means that they're one step away from

387
00:12:52,529 --> 00:12:55,529
actually being on the endangered list

388
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:57,329
it's so incredibly sad because their

389
00:12:55,529 --> 00:12:58,380
habitats are being taken away and I know

390
00:12:57,329 --> 00:13:00,660
that there's kind of like a common

391
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:01,920
misconception in zoos of like oh like

392
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,880
these animals should not be captain zoos

393
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,500
like just put them back in their

394
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,810
habitats but a lot of these animals

395
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,160
don't actually have habitats to go back

396
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:11,160
to because they're being destroyed and

397
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,390
DeForest and so quickly and it was

398
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,649
really really sad it was actually so

399
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:16,019
cool too because we got to meet the lead

400
00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:17,250
giraffe keeper who was at the zoo and he

401
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:17,970
had literally just gotten back from a

402
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:20,760
several weeks

403
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:22,410
trip to Africa to be part of a draft

404
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,399
conservation program also which I

405
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:24,149
thought was literally the funniest thing

406
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:25,890
ever

407
00:13:24,149 --> 00:13:27,600
a lot of the drafts and the actual

408
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:29,790
exhibit were little babies which at

409
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,220
first I was so confused because they

410
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:33,959
were all equally as tall hello that's

411
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,010
what John Stehr known for and I asked

412
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:36,470
how old they were because I wanted to

413
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:39,329
know how quickly they grew and

414
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:40,800
apparently giraffes are literally born

415
00:13:39,329 --> 00:13:43,829
out of their mothers

416
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,990
at 6 feet tall already hello

417
00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:48,410
I need all boys to be like that first of

418
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:50,699
all second of all like oh my god that

419
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:51,990
mother all right I say this what I had

420
00:13:50,699 --> 00:13:53,970
and I baked my face to really reinforce

421
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:54,600
those highlights but I'm realizing that

422
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:57,420
I was just

423
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:59,370

of you guys already know this but

479
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:59,660
chimpanzees are actually the closest

480
00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:02,720
cousin to humans so like they're

481
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:04,670
technically our sisters kind of so fun

482
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,170
love that for us but literally just

483
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:08,540
let's talk about beforehand chimpanzees

484
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:10,370
are already endangered which is once

485
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:14,830
again so sad and they're closely related

486
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:17,660
to us - how are we humans ruining that

487
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:19,880
so sad like a little bit this blows my

488
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:21,500

color schemes and let's do it sister

504
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:51,200

Evelyn do you like these colors great

514
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:08,270
alright guys so Evelyn the gorilla ended

515
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:09,890
up choosing the jeffree star thirsty

516
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:11,270
palette I'm so excited to play this one

517
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:12,410
today and also as well which I thought

518
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:14,209
was so cute and I just realized

519
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:16,040
literally now filming this video Evelyn

520
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:17,660
was a western lowland gorilla and she

521
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,190
actually had orange and blue on her face

522
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:23,750
and look at the palette she picked

523
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:25,250
literally hello orange blue queen I'm

524
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,900
gonna start archiving a fluffy crease

525
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:29,060
brush and dipping into this shade right

526
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,410
here at the name of which I cannot say

527
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:32,840
on camera being that this is a

528
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:34,100
family-friendly youtube channel but it

529
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,900
is calling my name and I'm gonna pop

530
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,180
this right in the crease just to kind of

531
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,440
start off our eye look today

532
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:40,270
honestly have no idea what I'm doing yet

533
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:44,130
I'm just gonna play around just like the

534
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:46,420
gorillas dead that was a really bad pot

535
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:48,190
let's see what I could come up with this

536
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:50,740
is like a hybrid between like an orange

537
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:52,630
and a pink and a peach this color is so

538
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:54,100
pretty I'm obsessive oh wow

539
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:55,630
next under up a little fluffy brush and

540
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,160
dip into the shade quench it's this

541
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:58,690
bright yellow shade in the bottom right

542
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,220
here and I'm just gonna lightly go over

543
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:02,290
those edges to make sure they're nice

544
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:04,360
and blended out super super similarly

545
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:05,680
and obviously unfortunately to the

546
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,570
giraffes and the chimpanzees the

547
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:09,130
gorillas are actually endangered and not

548
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:10,270
only are they endangered by they're

549
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,500
actually what's called critically

550
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:13,420
endangered meaning that they're you're

551
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,680
literally about to be extinct

552
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,850
fortunately though there are so many

553
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,380
programs and so many people working

554
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:19,300
tirelessly and putting in so much effort

555
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:21,400
to do everything that they possibly can

556
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:23,380
to keep Carlos alive and well and with

557
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,390
us here on planet Earth similar to the

558
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:27,610
giraffe keeper the gorilla keeper Tania

559
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:28,990
actually travels to Africa all the time

560
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:30,970
to work actively towards gorilla

561
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:32,470
conservation in the field we also found

562
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:33,280
out - on the very very Geo so I don't

563
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:35,860
know if I'm supposed to tell you guys

564
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,570
this but Tanya actually personally funds

565
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:39,250
trekking permits in order to send

566
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:40,330
Rangers out there to protect the

567
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:43,000
gorillas against poaching which I

568
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:44,950
literally think is so so so cool so

569
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,450
honorable and I hope I'm allowed to say

570
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:47,680
that but I just think that is really

571
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:48,730
really dope and it shows that there are

572
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,860
truly good people out there working

573
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:52,510
actively to save these animals next time

574
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:53,920
to grab the shade a stroke in the upper

575
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,910
right hand corner and use this to deepen

576
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,380
up the crease just a little bit I'm

577
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:57,520
gonna grab the shade - rizal and I tried

578
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,870
a little fluffy brush in the bottom

579
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,730
corner and use this to deepen up the

580
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:03,190
crease in the outer V I literally have

581
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:04,180
no idea where this look is going just

582
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:05,290
like none of these animals know where

583
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:07,930
their habitat is going

584
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:09,490
that was a good pun but a serious pun

585
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:13,960
I'm gonna use the excess concealer and

586
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:15,190
cut the crease and then right on top of

587
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,780
the concealer I'm just gonna grab the

588
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:19,420
shade a filthy rich and packed that

589
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:20,560
right on for a nice little pop and then

590
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:22,390
just going right back into the original

591
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:25,590
shade I'm just going to blend out that

592
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:27,580
edge make sure there's no harsh lines oh

593
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:29,500
that's pretty

594
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:30,730
hello all right guys need to finish off

595
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,590
this I looked today for the lower lash

596
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:34,360
and is gonna be super simple and it's

597
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:35,980
going to add in a bright pop of blue so

598
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:38,350
I'm gonna grab the shade submerge right

599
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:39,250
down here this color is so so so so

600
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,990
ending and I'm just gonna put this right

601
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,150
up against the lower lash I think this

602
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:44,310
needs a winged liner so

603
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:46,650
like separated Oh supposed to be a small

604
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:48,750
Wang she's big and beefy

605
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:50,310
I reckon that is one gorilla inspired I

606
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,510
have looked all complete I'm gonna go

607
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:52,680

609
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,930

k'kaw Beauty highlighter so let's see

627
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:25,400

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:42,120
hello would you like this one oh oh this

629
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:43,320
one really likes sister cam alright

630
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,330
sister said between the two of these are

631
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:47,100
on our friend definitely chose the k'kaw

632
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:48,810
highlighter he's following this one all

633
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,790
around in the pool it was so so so cute

634
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:52,230
I'm little obsessive otters but they

635
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:54,270
just rent down the water side and left

636
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:57,630
us very very rude because her keeper is

637
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:59,730
feeding them but also I don't blame them

638
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:01,980
for leaving us for food I would also do

639
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:02,940
the same thing so for her later today of

640
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,590
course so gonna be using it the

641
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:06,150
brand-new k'kaw BD highlighter palette

642
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:08,250
could have dip into these two shades as

643
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:09,450
chosen by at my otter friends I was

644
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:11,430
literally convinced that I like wanted

645
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:13,800
to adopt an otter after meeting them

646
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:16,020
they're also so so adorable and so cute

647
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,190
but otters submerged a lot of the other

648
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:19,110
animals were like you know today are

649
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:21,360
actually endangered due to habitat

650
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:22,950
destruction which is so incredibly sad

651
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,360
and our target at the zoo is actually

652
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,620
telling us how it's a really really

653
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,850
awesome thing at the zoo when they

654
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:28,200
actually get a new litter of otters

655
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:29,850
because of the fact that it's like

656
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,620
giving them a home and it's furthering

657
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:33,000
the population because there aren't much

658
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:34,380
of them left and zoos are kind of one of

659
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,700
the only place that can actually exist

660
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:38,460
safely

661
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:40,090
[Music]

662
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:41,950
alright guys so now that we are all

663
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:43,840

664
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:46,030
day is going to be our lips for this

we're heading into the one exhibit that

666
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:50,020
are you know we don't want to turn today

667
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:51,670
and that is the layer with all of the

668
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,960
reptiles and amphibians if you guys know

669
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:56,230

670
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,790
snakes whoa and a lot of other reptiles

671
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:59,950
so hopefully this using process will be

672
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:01,150
okay I know we'll be safe but just a

673
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:02,350
little bit concerned and hopefully one

negatively about extinction and

697
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:57,490
engagement this entire video it was

698
00:22:56,140 --> 00:23:00,250
thought that the bouton was actually

699
00:22:57,490 --> 00:23:02,470
extinct and told in the 1980s when they

700
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:05,110
actually discovered the species living

701
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:06,640

generally so much fun I want to say a

711
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:27,010
major major thank you to the LA Zoo for

712
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,270
working with me on those videos today I

713
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:29,710
know the zoo sometimes can have a

714
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:31,270
negative connotation with them and have

715
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:33,010
had a little bit of a controversial past

716
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:34,450
and not even gonna lie going into this

717
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:36,820
video today I was a little bit nervous

718
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:37,990
and skeptical but everything that I saw

719
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:39,940
and everybody that I met and everything

720
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:41,980
that I learned today taught me the exact

721
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:43,300
opposite every single person we met from

722
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:44,740
the zoo right from our tour guide

723
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,330
Katherine who is literally the sweetest

724
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:47,800
in the entire world to all the different

725
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:49,810
zoo keepers you could tell we're so

726
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,160
passionate and so knowledgeable

727
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:52,660
about their jobs every single question

728
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,250
they asked they had a million different

729
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:55,840
answers for and we're really just so

730
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:57,850
excited to tell us everything about each

731
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,320
animal it was so blatantly obvious to us

732
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:00,910
how much each different zookeeper

733
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:03,070
actually took care of their animals and

734
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:04,300
was so passionate about their jobs some

735
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:06,070
of them literally even making at their

736
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:07,570
own personally funded trucks to the

737
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:09,370
animals natural habitat to work on

738
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:10,480
preservation and to learn more I know

739
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:12,400
there's a common misconception about

740
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,200
zoos and the mistreatment of animals and

741
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,520
listen guys I was very skeptical when I

742
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,230
went into this as well and it was

743
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,000
actually really cool because I did get

744
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:20,770
to actually ask Katherine our tour guide

745
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,480
about this and she even admitted that

746
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:24,340
this definitely was a huge issue in the

747
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,870
past but a lot of zoos now are working

748
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:27,640
actively on preservation and

749
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:29,350
conservation to fix the reputation that

750
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,760
was given to them so many years ago I

751
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:32,620
know it's very easy to see an exotic

752
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:34,270
animal in an enclosure and think oh my

753
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:35,560
god this animal needs to be released

754
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:38,080
back into the wild it doesn't belong

755
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:39,280
here but in reality a lot of the animals

756
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,810
that we got to meet and interact with

757
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,310
and learn about today we're critically

758
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:44,440
endangered meaning that they don't

759
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:45,970
really have habitats to actually go back

760
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:47,350
to zoos are kind of one of the only

761
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:49,840
places left where they can actually

762
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:51,280
exist safely as a species and at least

763
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,840
humans will get to learn about them and

764
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,400
appreciate them and do anything we

765
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:56,230
possibly can to keep them here for as

766
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,880
long as possible I want to say a major

767
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:59,110
major thank you to the LA Zoo for

768
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:01,000
working with me on those videos today

769
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:02,260
this video was not sponsored at all but

770
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,460
they really went above and beyond to

771
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,900
help us out today and make sure that we

772
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:06,760
got an amazing fitting with a bunch of

773
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:08,380
amazing animals the LA Zoo actually won

774
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:10,030
an international award last year for

775
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:11,710
conservation which literally is just so

776
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:13,270
cool and truly shows how much work and

777
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:14,890
love they put into their jobs every

778
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:16,870
single day so I encourage you guys to do

779
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:18,610
research visit learn more and see what

780
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:20,530
you can do actively to help because I

781
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:22,480
know I'm going to I had such an amazing

782
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:24,700
days today and I genuinely cannot wait

783
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,380
to go back and learn so much more and I
