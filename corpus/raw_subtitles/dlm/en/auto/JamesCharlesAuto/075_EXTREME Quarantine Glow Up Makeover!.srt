godly without but anyway for right now

63
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:17,760
it's time to do my own intent looking a

64
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,020
little bit hey I'm actually gonna tell

65
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,150
you guys this maze ado is in partnership

66
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:23,100
with a bomb knights and they are in

67
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:24,600
Australia tenant gran they actually

68
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,580
learned about them I think it was like

69
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,960
two or three years now the first thing

70
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,610
that I was there when Australia for a

71
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,810
really good friend of Bercow and I

72
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,220
linked our products a lot because

73
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,350
obviously they're self tearing which is

74
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,820
important but I like be a color on your

75
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:38,040
tones that the public see this house

76
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:39,420
because it's more like all until where

77
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,480
is a lot of other tanning products or

78
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:44,340
orange which is not the move so yeah I'm

79
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,590
just going to squirt a nice amount onto

80
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,510
my little tanning glove and the design

81
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:50,340
used to be color light / medium by the

82
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:52,170
way they do have a dark as well first

83
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,510
going to rub it on my leg and I just

84
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:57,270
going to do even strokes all over you

85
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:59,160
know even show up sir even folks okay so

86
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:01,620
I really am self tanning in general

87
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,700
especially if you guys are going for

88
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,260
what I do know that I used to get spray

89
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,420
tans all the time okay I'm not going to

90
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,920
pretend like that wasn't like okay but I

91
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:10,130
like self-tanning a lot better one

92
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,480
because it's a lot less expensive okay

93
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:14,040
although they look great we're very very

94
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,870
pricey and I got to get them touched on

95
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,970
all time whereas this usually this rub

96
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:18,989
on and then just wait a few hours but

97
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,250
obviously we're putting this during the

98
00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:23,810
day as well but usually let's do this

99
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,810
before bed and then I'll sleep in it

100
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:32,400
Alex really makes them bronzed alright

101
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,930
so how do pretty much look like over my

102
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,669
entire body now and I'm just going to

103
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,980
use the access attending the stuff on

104
00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:40,140
the mat and just do what my face so I'm

105
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:41,970
not gonna do like a full score on here

106
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:43,590
just because I don't want to be crazy

107
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:45,000
alright eBay so the second I'm going to

108
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:47,040
cut in winter Tana

109
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,630
a nice butt cheeks put some clothes back

110
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,430
on and we're going to let this chance at

111
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:52,590
my body for about six hours

112
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:53,880
oops six hours in order to get the best

113
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:55,770
result so I can have that beautiful

114
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,419
Australian aglow if you want to take a

115
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:58,380
warm shower and wipe everything off and

116
00:04:57,419 --> 00:04:59,940

117
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:02,100

118
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:03,380

tan okay so before we head on to the

124
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:14,270
harder parts of the transformation that

125
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,770
like doing my own nails and cutting my

126
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:18,110
own hair I want to show you guys one

127
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:20,750
super easy and really really cute way to

128
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:21,860
get fake freckles using actual henna in

129
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,630
case you guys don't know what henna is

130
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:25,610
and is basically a natural type of a

131
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:27,440
temporary tattoo used in Indian culture

132
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:29,210
to do it literally the most stunning a

133
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,560
beautiful body art ever and you guys

134
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:32,060
know that I love fake freckles and live

135
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,200
and put them on all the time and I was

136
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:35,060
looking into how to like actually

137
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,620
achieve them a few months ago and a lot

138
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,750
of people were using actual natural

139
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:40,280
henna to do them so I ordered a bunch on

140
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,570
Etsy if you guys decide to do this by

141
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,040
the way make sure that you don't just

142
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:44,720
get like a stupid store-bought henna get

143
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,980
it on either Amazon or Etsy and make

144
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,870
sure you're searching for natural stop

145
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:49,280
or else it's gonna look so bad and I try

146
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:50,810
the same as before so don't worry but

147
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,430
I'm just gonna use my henna cold it and

148
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:54,920
give myself some phone calls so

149
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:57,290
basically all I'm gonna do is just start

150
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,400
putting little dots all over my face and

151
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,620
I know this is gonna look absolutely

152
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,360
crazy okay we're gonna leave this on it

153
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:03,590
for pretty much as long as the spray tan

154
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,180
so we'll take it off at the same time

155
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:06,680
but when we take this off it's gonna

156
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:09,680
leave a really really natural-looking

157
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,360
super super light orgy reddish-brown

158
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,270
stain on your skin for a few days that

159
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:17,060
looks exactly like real freckles

160
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:19,910
like I said they look crazy yeah yeah

161
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:23,150
trust me okay it's gonna look so so good

162
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:25,190
and a lot less particular nation around

163
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:26,360
this all right you guys so the next step

164
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:29,000
of our quarantine

165
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:32,570
glow up is going to be doing my own

166
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,820
nails now this I am so scared for okay

167
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:36,320
I've never done that my own nails before

168
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:38,180

00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,500

weeks ago as you can see they are very

171
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,160
very grown out so I guess I'm gonna try

172
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,480
to get myself a build today so I've

173
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,130
gotten my nails done enough times out to

174
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,750
kind of know the basic like techniques

00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:49,220
of what needs to happen and I know that

176
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:51,200
I need to start off by getting rid of

177
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,860
the topcoat and gel polish that was on

178
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,650

time for the haircut now this is a body

199
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,040
part the part that I both scared about

200
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,570
about with quarantine all the

201
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,340
barbershops your clothes sort of Trance

202
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:56,200
ourselves I overheard a nice set of

203
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:56,200
razors and guards online I'm here

204
00:08:04,630 --> 00:09:18,850
oh really let's go from 1 to 10 how do

205
00:08:46,840 --> 00:09:20,410
you think it is shorter to fix it

206
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,640
situation it started off with the faux

207
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:23,740
freckles I'm very excited to show you

208
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:26,080
guys how this actually works so first

209
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:36,510
I'm going to start picking off my little

210
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:36,510
spots ready nothing nothing is going on

211
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:42,079

212
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:44,240
stained through the fan and once I

213
00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:45,470
shower you know the Tamil a little bit

214
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,079
and the freckles will actually be there

215
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:52,700
I wish that's a big brain scientifical

216
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:54,110
thinking that's dilution this particular

217
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,399
angle for this near selfie and the ray

218
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,870
of light coming in is very very

219
00:09:55,399 --> 00:10:00,230
reminiscent of a certain photo that

220
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:02,269
befall the Sun - so you guys can see how

221
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:03,860

222
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:05,959
sparkles look like I'm so obsessed with

223
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:07,130
my skin look like this all the time and

224
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:08,240

just like always and they just naturally

226
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,480
fade away so if you guys want a good

227
00:10:09,649 --> 00:10:13,130
easy way to do a football to check out

228
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,570
getting a natural cut up and now all

229
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:17,620

00:12:10,249 --> 00:12:13,609
p.m. and we started this this morning at

10:00 a.m. at this point I don't even

292
00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:16,699
know if it was worth it because of how

293
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:18,019
challenging today was I definitely

294
00:12:16,699 --> 00:12:19,579
learned my lesson to leave it to the

296
00:12:19,579 --> 00:12:22,789
need to do this entire globe routine but
