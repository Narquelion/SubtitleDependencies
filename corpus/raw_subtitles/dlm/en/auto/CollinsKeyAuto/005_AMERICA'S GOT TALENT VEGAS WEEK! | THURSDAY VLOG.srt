00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,890
experience first of all I'm just very

11
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,359
grateful for the fact I even made it to

00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:27,029

Daly's hotel they see we just got

18
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,719
transferred out of a room because the

19
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,190
room smelled like rotten cabbage and so

20
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,989
the room was also there's no way we're

21
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:42,870

22
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:43,950
transferred to another room right now to

23
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:47,660
make sure I'm pretty excited about my

24
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:49,079
dad's over there in the business oh

25
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:53,579

00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:55,469
sup song ski day to Vegas in a long day

27
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:58,560
a lot of being on setting everything but

28
00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:02,010
in Ex the hotel room

29
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:04,320
this is day three of Vegas week and

30
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,430
today basically found out our face so I

31
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,110
guess what's actually happening is I'm

32
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,610
actually going to be uh I'm performing

33
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:09,960
in Vegas but they're working on my hacks

34
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:13,170
got to go through a stage run-through

35
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,920
today had a good time and just preparing

36
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,390
for the big show

37
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,940
I don't even know what day this is

38
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,740
Wednesday here in Vegas I just performed

39
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,460
and got the thing so they's like the

40
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,260
guys are they weren't supposed to

41
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,730
respond at all when I was up today like

42
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,980
they totally responded they were totally

43
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:27,060
into it and it's like they kept the book

44
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:29,310
afterwards they're trying to figure out

45
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,720
how it worked and I'm just super psyched

46
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,990
is like everything went totally

47
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,670
according to plan I had a blast with it

48
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:37,680
living the dream that 16 here in fake is

49
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,030
performing on this stage and you know

50
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,600
what happens in here is what happens

51
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:44,400
from here you know I'm just super

52
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,170
exciting I was like I didn't have like

53
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,210
any adrenaline on stage or anything it

54
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:50,850
was just kind of like I don't just feel

55
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:52,050
like super like their housing I was in

56
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:53,970
the moment everything but I just didn't

57
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:55,909
feel like the first time at least I had

58
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:58,249
a crazy amount of adrenaline going

59
00:01:55,909 --> 00:01:59,890
this time I felt totally bare and now

60
00:01:58,249 --> 00:02:03,560
the Adrenaline's kicking in I'm like oh

61
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:05,359
what happened in that so at the end he

62
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,520
was walking behind Todd and I together

63
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:08,629
and she actually like she stopped by and

64
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,739
she usually doesn't talk to anyone

65
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:12,379
because like oh my gosh this your dad

66
00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:15,200
and all the stuff so it was it was super

67
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:16,879
cool so yeah living the dream

68
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,590
so if everyone is calm key and this is

69
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,390
day I don't know what the heck I'm so

70
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:22,430
lost this has been one of the most like

71
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,900
intense weeks of my life Vegas week and

72
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:26,030
we're heading out of our hotel room

73
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:27,860

00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:32,930

00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:34,579
history of that venue to ever perform

77
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:37,069
there which I'm pretty pretty psyched

78
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:38,360
about and so basically I was checking

79
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:41,150

80
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:43,340

00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:53,390
excited about that

87
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,920

88
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:56,390

89
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,920

still cannot figure it out luckily she

91
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,160
brought it back the next day and gave me

92
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:02,540
