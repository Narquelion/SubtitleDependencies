70
00:04:53,600 --> 00:05:12,770
tire for a second no cannot do the

71
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:14,540
housing alive all the cans you comment

72
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:16,130
down below whose line was more explosive

73
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:19,660
and remember the loser gets all a whole

74
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:19,660
bunch of glitter jumps all over the

75
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:35,030
experiment drunk with a whole bunch of

76
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,440
Coca Cola and dropping a mega Mentos

77
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:38,450
into it and of course they had a giant

78
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,740
Coca Cola bottle rock goes literally fly

79
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:41,000

80
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,590
Cola bottles I've got a great way of

81
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,170

this on him to 100 we'll see we're gonna

84
00:05:50,330 --> 00:06:01,430
shake the bottle again that's the issue

85
00:05:51,920 --> 00:06:03,740
is that you're shaking it up into the

86
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:05,990
close-up of my eyes man you will see you

87
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:08,440

nothing I'm just I'm basically burning a

94
00:06:26,509 --> 00:06:29,719

100
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:43,999
it man usually if you having to figure

101
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:47,180
this stuff out for this that's a lot of

102
00:06:43,999 --> 00:06:48,770
Mentos man Baba sailor don't try this at

ah all right here we go let's took

107
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,689
forever but I've actually blended up all

108
00:06:58,159 --> 00:07:01,219
the Mentos into this like dough looking

109
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:03,349

you gotta do to finish up my vile

112
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:07,099
experiment just fill this thing up with

113
00:07:05,419 --> 00:07:08,599
55 gallons of coca-cola and then shape

114
00:07:07,099 --> 00:07:09,919
this into the perfect Mentos shape and

115
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:11,689
I'll be ready to go and all I gotta do

116
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,189
is add these electric parts attach these

117
00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:14,599
bottles and add some fins and that's

118
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:16,219
gonna fly all right we got the coca-cola

119
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:18,499
Rocky now it's time to see if he's got a

120
00:07:16,219 --> 00:07:20,360
lawn I am very skeptical about this Evan

121
00:07:18,499 --> 00:07:21,949
cos we have rocket blast once before

122
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,659
yeah there was some slight cheating that

123
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:25,039
happened yeah yeah it didn't even really

124
00:07:23,659 --> 00:07:26,870
work so we're gonna put this on right

125
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,279
all right so cons I'm gonna have you

126
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:30,680
hold the remote here we go yeah here's

127
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:33,349
the remote what part do I not cut any of

128
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,969
this doesn't clear what are we touch

129
00:07:33,349 --> 00:07:36,499
what do I talk I gotta move on what

130
00:07:34,969 --> 00:07:38,810
about touch yeah there yeah all you're

131
00:07:36,499 --> 00:07:40,490
gonna do is rotate this when it's time

132
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:41,959
the wheel the wheel brother we have not

133
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:44,959
the trigger no not the figure whatever

134
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:47,330
you do do not pull the trigger so I'm

135
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:48,620
gonna pull the trick no no no not at all

136
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:50,569
so what you're gonna do cause is the

137
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:52,310
moment I pull this it's going to release

138
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:53,899
the air pressure and then what are you

139
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:55,370
gonna do pull the trigger against your

140
00:07:53,899 --> 00:07:56,870
better judgment Devon I just cannot stop

141
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:59,649
myself from party you've really know to

142
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,649
press a while

143
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:05,039
whoa okay nothing happening guess what

144
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:06,120
happened nothing I guess we're good all

145
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,289
right I heard something in the distance

146
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:11,190
I don't know probably follows my

147
00:08:07,289 --> 00:08:18,599
imagination ha pull it again pull it

148
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:19,560
again don't worry Hale don't know so you

149
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:21,150
don't move the wheel a little

150
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:25,889
adventurous for me is pulling the

151
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:27,060
trigger like nothing's happening yet I'm

152
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:28,259
gonna be way cooler man that's kind of

153
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,550
boring are here as they want to scoot

154
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:31,530
back but the issues I'm in the Sun as

155
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:33,209

we didn't even lunch I think mines gonna

164
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:03,600
be even more explosive so right now

165
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:05,370
let's do it oh dude I did my shoes bro

166
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,959
it's finally time to test this massive

167
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:08,070
coca-cola and mentos explosion I had to

168
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,600
go back to the drawing board a little

169
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:11,010
bit actually glued all whole bunch of

170
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,930
Mentos together I've also added some

171
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:14,310
baking cleanser dust coming out of it

172
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,660
College that's baking soda no it

173
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,920
actually reminds me of one of those hair

174
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,839
nets that you wear when you make food

175
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,250

255
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,370

normal week okay any more can be turned

263
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,040

265
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,490
the future inside of it activate the

266
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,319

exploding everything looking great mine

415
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:24,980

416
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:27,620
thank you what about the elephant

417
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:29,480
toothpaste do you mean you had you

418
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:30,830
watermelon one and then I had you know

419
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,690
the one with the bunch of holes I think

420
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:34,670
my watermelon geyser was absolutely

421
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:35,630
awesome boys shot up went everywhere it

422
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:37,370
was pretty quiet

423
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:39,800
it was pretty typical he'd done that

424
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:41,390
before but mine I've never done that I'd

425
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,890
actually took a lot of time cutting out

426
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:44,420
those holes so I'd appreciate the win on

427
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:46,190
those my I do I do have to say what kind

428
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:47,960
of exploding octopus and way I describe

429
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:49,190
it yeah so there yeah I guess that was

430
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,570
it all comes down to this the tiebreak

431
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:52,490
yeah the holes in the ground with coke

432
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:54,020
admit doesn't yeltsin truth but just

433
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:55,790
sodas and I have to say why are we doing

434
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:57,410
this one as a tiebreaker like the least

435
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:59,900
definitive one of yeah I was definitely

436
00:20:57,410 --> 00:21:01,430
a game of inches or millimeters yeah all

437
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:03,230
right so yeah if it's a game of inches

438
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:05,300
or millimeters I think I don't think so

439
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:09,830
man I think I think I think Mama's

440
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:11,330
pretty good play if they don't really

441
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:12,440
you know if you were to hear to replan

442
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:16,370

443
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:17,990
yeah bats is one different class yeah

444
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:20,660
