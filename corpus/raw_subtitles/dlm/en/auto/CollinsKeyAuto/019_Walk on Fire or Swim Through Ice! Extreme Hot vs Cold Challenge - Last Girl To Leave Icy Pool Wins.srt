00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,120
warmed up all right we have now seen the

506
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,240
ice swim so now it's your turn the fire

507
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,240
water how you feeling

508
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,360
it's gonna be hot nina it was it was

509
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,039
mind over matter right

510
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,160
right all in here exactly so i think

511
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,120
it's kind of a similar thing here with

512
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,880
the with the fire right

513
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,840
i mean i could burn but yeah mine over

514
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,840
here

515
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,160
at this point i think the best way to do

516
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,679
it from what i've heard is to put a

517
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,200
blindfold on that you don't actually see

518
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,320
the fire and then cover your ears as

519
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,840
well for right now because kind of like

520
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,600
like sensory deprivation you basically

521
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,960
won't feel the flames if you can't see

522
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,120
them or hear them okay okay

523
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,320
seems legit right yeah yeah yep you pop

524
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,679
the blindfold on okay

525
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,120
yep just like that and if you want to

526
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,039
cover your ears that way you won't be

527
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,240
able to hear anything

528
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,600
all right yep so jacob keeps like

529
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,840
sensory deprivation come on come on come

530
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,240
on come on

531
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,280
come on up here come on over here all

532
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,880
right so here's the game plan we've got

533
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,640
a second board that's completely safe

534
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,240
with no fire no flames no nothing it's

535
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,600
not hot at all so do not worry she will

536
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,640
not be stepping on anything hot but

537
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,919
