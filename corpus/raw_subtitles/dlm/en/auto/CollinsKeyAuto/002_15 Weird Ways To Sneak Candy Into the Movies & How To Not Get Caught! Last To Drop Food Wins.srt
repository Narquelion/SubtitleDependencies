1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,840
everyone knows movie theater food is so

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:05,839
expensive one skittles

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,600
what why we're gonna show you how to

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,120
sneak candy and snacks into the movies

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,599
without being caught but here's the

6
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,599
twist

7
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,440
this is not your normal movie theater

8
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,360
security and each theater is equipped

9
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,400
with the most insane security checkpoint

10
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,160
that we're gonna have to try to get

11
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,840
through without being caught and by the

12
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,439
end of the video whoever has the most

13
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,640
amount of candy confiscated they will be

14
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,000
ejected from the fever

15
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,760
literally the first feeder you're

16
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,439
sneaking candy into is protected by a

17
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,800
vicious guard dog and i want to sneak in

18
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,840
as much candy as possible in these

19
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,840
skittles here

20
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,840
you're the worst at opening bags to

21
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,120
sneak by candy and i have a genius way

22
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,719
of getting it inside these stuffed

23
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,800
animals what i've got a way better way

24
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,840
to sneak it in devin i've got

25
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,120

29
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,760
all right so i'm going to pretend that i

30
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,920
have a baby bump because i hear dogs are

31
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,600
very protective of pregnant women

32
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,199
back it up literally i'm going to have a

33
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,800

perfect pregnancy belly for bella here

43
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,840
all the stuffed animal lovers out there

44
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,840

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,280
i actually needed to stay attached a

46
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,400
little bit but this is perfect not to

47
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,920

48
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,400
basketball lovers out there yeah i am

oh my goodness i don't feel too good

52
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,240
right now

53
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,079
i'm not as strong as i once was getting

54
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,840
a little like bomb

55
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,200
there we go it's now storm breaker mode

56
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,320
so here we go three

57
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,240
two one two there we go that's what i'm

58
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,399
talking about so bella we are now

59
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,000

61
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,640
hey there yeah i mean for a basketball

62
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,240
it's relatively convincing so for mine i

63
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,840
just have to remove some of the stuffing

64
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,880
so i can fit a ton of candy into here

65
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,399
all right we've lined the inside of the

66
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,920
basketball with a whole bunch of rice

67
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,600
krispies treats that way the dog will

68
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,960
not be able to smell all the other candy

69
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,399
how's the tiger going though it's going

70
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,920
great so now that i have it empty it's

71
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,200
time to fill it up with candy all right

72
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,080
well the next thing i got to figure out

73
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,599
is my booty

74
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,879
and more importantly what i'm gonna put

75
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:12,400
as my booty implants we'll try and

76
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:13,680
cantaloupe and this little thing it

77
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,480
gives me a little bit uneven but hey

78
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,920
it's nature

79
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,040
that's gonna go down your pants bro i

80
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,000

hop inside thank you hey we were able to

178
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,600
sneak the candy in theater number one

179
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,360
but sneaking into theater number two is

180
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,360
gonna be way harder because it's guarded

181
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,880
by the candy crushing car wash it's a

182
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,560
spinning nightmare designed to dislodge

183
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,320
the candy and send it flying so right

184
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,360
now try to get devin and hide our candy

185
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,160
for the next theater we're going to try

186
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,000
to sneak in as

187
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,600
many gummy bears as we possibly can and

188
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,280
the strategy on this one is to hide them

189
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,800
in plain sight so i'm going to make arms

190
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,240
and legs out of gums i'm going to make

191
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,759
gummy clothing so right now we're going

192
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,039
to cut a little hole in the inside so i

193
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,000
got to get this over my head all right

194
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,080
so i filled this

195
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,080
hand with some gummies trying to remove

196
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,280
the plastic hand from it

197
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,360
here we go here's the hole let's see if

198
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,120

319
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,600
giant mystery wheel we have no idea what

320
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,200
we're actually up against so we're gonna

321
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,279
have to get creative with the diys

322
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,480
i am gonna make a baby out of candy i

323
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,079
don't even wanna know how that works

324
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,920
nobody is gonna suspect

325
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:09,519
a cute little baby all right for me i'm

326
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,440
gonna attach candy all over my body to

327
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,959
my arms but the backpack is gonna be lit

328
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,480
so i got my suit here and the first

329
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,839
thing is i have to make the head of the

330
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,480
baby just gonna pour it in here like

331
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:20,000
this

332
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,399

that's what i'm talking about i gotta

335
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,839
say i think your method might be a

336
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,120
little bit better than my method even

337
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,079
though i'm like a full-grown person i

338
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,720
think the baby's actually working out a

339
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,279
lot better so

340
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,120

and this is going to be near impossible

527
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,240
to sneak candy through because it is an

528
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:14,000
insane obstacle course filled with axes

529
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,839

530
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,520

so we're gonna try to sneak in the most

535
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,760
difficult foods for me an entire plate

536
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,880
of nachos and i'm gonna be sneaking in

537
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,079
an ice cream sundae

538
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,320

539
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:32,320
helper in there up

541
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,840

543
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,200

chips around the exterior here it's a

550
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,120
