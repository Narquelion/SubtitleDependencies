looked like a giant pumpkin one of the

5
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:10,980
reasons that I love Halloween so much is

6
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,420
because I'm able to dress up and be a

7
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,070
completely different person for an

8
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,350

I in fact did that is put on a poncho

71
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:11,210
which I have honestly never seen a

72
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,680
firefighter to walk into like a burning

73
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:14,450
building wearing a poncho I walked

74
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,550
actually into a fire station I had the

75
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:18,980

76
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:20,390
fire stage wearing a poncho and telling

77
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,920
them that I was a firefighter and then

78
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,450
I'm on some sort of intercom talking to

82
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,420

we bought the costume and like a few

159
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,580
days later he changed his mind you want

160
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,900
to be an army man you're not allowed to

161
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,980
return the costume which is kind of a

162
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,990
bummer so that you know I'll sacrifice

163
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:04,060
myself all we have the skeleton costume

164
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:05,830
so you guys can buy Devon another

165
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:07,420
costume that's why I ended up being a

166
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:09,430
skeleton that costume sucks because I

167
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:11,710

that mask on until that Halloween trick

174
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,150

183
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:38,380
I thinking that is not even a costume I

184
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:44,140
thought when I couldn't smile as well I

185
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:45,700
was like oh yes the ultra sexy Indian

186
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,290
all of you been asking for a shirtless

187
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,970
picture so I thought this would be the

188
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:50,020
perfect time to give it to you but I've

189
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:52,690
been is not what you're looking for

190
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:54,490
three year old me with red blood all

191
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:56,590
over why why do i blood on my face why

192
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:57,970
don't I put paint on my armpits look up

193
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:59,890
the feathers sticking straight up to

194
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:00,940
signify that I'm a warrior that's not

195
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:02,470
even a spear that's like the most

196
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,520
crooked if I try to throw that it will

197
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:05,260
probably like boomerang you're getting

198
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,850
in the face oh then the mushroom cut

199
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:08,530
that just accentuates it shows the

200
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:10,360
fierceness of the warrior and shows how

201
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:11,740
powerful they are in a combat battle

202
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:16,120
that's why the most of their

203
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:18,870
