5
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,700

6
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:16,529

Jake Creek way to teleport from Robin

9
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:25,680
London for today's video we are going to

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,880
be doing the wet head challenge and so

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,949
basically how this challenge works we

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,170
have water contained above our heads

13
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:33,239
right here he came up with a list of

14
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,920
British slang that I probably don't know

15
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:36,300
and I came up with a list of American

16
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,010
slang and so in a moment we're gonna be

17
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,510
asking each other a question so let's

18
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,850
say that I ask him a question and he

19
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:44,070
gets it right then he gets to pull out

20
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,510
one of these pins but then if I ask

21
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,250
question and you get it wrong then I get

22
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,710
to pull one of the pins out of your head

23
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:52,050
and one of these pins will release all

24
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,460
the water on to our head so I'm not

25
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,629
exactly sure how many rounds gonna be

26
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,059
doing what I will let you guys know

27
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:59,340
whoever wins the majority of the rounds

73
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:46,730

74
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,290

79
00:02:52,790 --> 00:03:00,280
but um yeah now it's my turn to ask him

80
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:03,980
a question so here is the term jack up

81
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:07,850

hill like grass I'm real I never say

186
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,700

00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:13,680
so much water how is it contained so

190
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,630
much water I've officially peed myself

191
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,590
I'm about go refill my hat and then

192
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:18,060
we're about to finish this up I think

193
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:19,590
I'm in the lead points wise right now

194
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,790
but I'm definitely losing in the getting

195
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:22,230
wet department so hope that you have to

196
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:25,530
jump in the pool because I marry a girl

197
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:27,450
right now yeah well I'm back I've

198
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:30,030
refilled my water so this one I'm gonna

199
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:31,560
go for my hardest one trying to stump

200
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:32,970
you because I need to get you soaking

201
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,440
wet bro this is not fair if you get this

202
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:37,290
one I'll be very disappointed

203
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:40,290
the word is cramp okay so there's not

204
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:42,270
much room in like home to the car okay

205
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:46,800
you gotta cram it all in there your

206
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:48,450
final answer that is actually wrong

207
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,100
maybe you could use it like that look

208
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:51,810
water you still driven on me but the

209
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,580
other we could use it is I thought what

210
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:55,380
people who usually use it for is I have

211
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:57,020
to cram for finals or like I've gotta

212
00:08:55,380 --> 00:09:00,020
scram and do a whole bunch of studying

213
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:00,020
okay

214
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:17,400
Oh finally God finally got him well so I

215
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,870
think we'll call it the end for this

216
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,040
part of the challenge and I believe I'm

217
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:22,590
in the lead right now so you know that

218
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:24,570
