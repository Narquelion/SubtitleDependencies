110
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:55,870

cut off his own ear only thing he has

112
00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:03,940
been thinking about or doing over the

113
00:06:57,639 --> 00:07:05,710
past week has been going so my guess is

114
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:09,849
he's probably going to where he can

115
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:12,270
finally go the promise he'll like it

116
00:07:09,849 --> 00:07:12,270

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,050
like Lydia's not quite made out to be a

211
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:38,060
security guard so we're gonna put it to

212
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:44,620
a test again but this time at night and

213
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:46,460
this time with some real danger like

214
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,780
someone's gonna try to break in they

215
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,920
could just grab so here we're gonna do

216
00:11:47,780 --> 00:12:19,900
