place where it's super prominent

34

everyone can see his big beautiful face

35
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,840
on a nice big old billboard oh

36
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,560

oh boy

39
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,880
it's a lot of money okay right but what

40
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,560
what is money is paper

41
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,159
comes and grows that's what you say it

42
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,840
comes and goes money is

43
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,360
paper you're talking yourself into doing

44
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,960
the 25 000 that way is that what i'm

45
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,400
doing yeah i think so yeah hey let's do

46
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,880
it my argument was only going to be that

47
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,880
we have

48
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,640
most of the cash upstairs oh my god

49
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,320
you're right the money from the mercedes

50
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,280
couch fifteen thousand dollars is it

51
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,720
seventeen

52
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,079
no because we spent two can a weed

53
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,840
we just gotta come up with ten thousand

54
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,640
dollars we can get a sponsor yo that is

55
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,479
a good idea

56
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,759
all right all right we'll get a sponsor

57
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,880

58
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,799
video is brought to you by

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,399
no one no sponsors still which is

60
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,759
actually good because i prefer to do my

61
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,119
own thing and maverick clothing is the

62
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,840
new wave again it used to be maverick by

63
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,759
logan paul

64
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,360
um removing myself from the equation

65
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,159
still be gonna be like a face of the

66
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,520
brand obviously

67
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,280
but it's no longer about me we want to

68
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,560
make this big and not just an influencer

69
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,560
brand and you guys don't see it much on

70
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,399
this channel but i have a very uh

71
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,479
inspirational like almost contagious

72
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,240
motivational side that instead of just

73
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,160
preaching about greatness and how

74
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,920
awesome everyone can be which i will do

75
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,039
but i also stuck it on clothing because

76
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,160

unfortunately i also got kicked out but

116
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,720

best friend's billboard on one of the

118
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,239

203
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,080
any idea about what to do in this on

204
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,440
this spinning rock

205
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,360

206
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,120
watching this that have no clue that

207
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,720
have no clue what they want to do

208
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,800
how they want to do it because i was

209
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,560
there i was just there it was a store i

210
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,880
was just there i started

211
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,720
trying things i knew i knew i had

212
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,720
something and i didn't know what it was

213
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,639
i didn't know i wanted to be a youtuber

214
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,120
i didn't have the luxury of

215
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:04,560
knowing what it was but i knew i had

216
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,400
something and let me tell you this

217
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,599
if you've made it through addiction or

218
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,880
mental illness

219
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:12,319
you have something because a lot of

220
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,340
people don't

221
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,599
if you are still kicking today

222
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:17,759
[Music]

223
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,440
battling those demons you have something

224
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,039
because a lot of people didn't wake up

225
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,759
today because they couldn't make it

226
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,880
they couldn't cut it and you [ __ ] did

227
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:31,840
so you have something

228
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:31,840
but you might not know what it is
