movie and that's another thing that he

151
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,639
outright lied about was the fact that he

152
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,400
was going to be doing a documentary that

153
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,000

page three page four page five there was

158
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,639
a lot of thought that went into this and

159
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,240
when you guys asked this question

160
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,240
muhammad said how did you get the idea

161
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,759
to make this masterpiece one day i was

162
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,919

people called the flat earthers that

167
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,000

00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,240
for your first acting gig guy

189
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,599
and i had no idea what was going on and

190
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,400
it was literally like the first project

191
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,479
that we worked on

192
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,039
a lot of people wanted to know how like

193
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:27,360
you were good bro for your first acting

194
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,120
gig ever where does that come from i

195
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,720
don't even know dude i think right after

196
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,199
we talked i started working on that

197
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,360
story

198
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,120
oh my god that's right came up with the

199
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,000
the story about his dad being a

200
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,519
contractor

201
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,200
for antarctica i think that was your

202
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,479
idea yeah and then you would sit like

203
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,320
people would come over and you would

204
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:45,120
tell them about your track your dad

205
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,839
and pete rest in peace i really truly

206
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,920
believed

207
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,519
uh what the storyline was and i think

208
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,000
mike his best friend really helped play

209
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,640
it along

210
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,480
that's because mike lost a a friend

211
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,920
all right pete didn't die pete doesn't

212
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,080
he's not even a real person

213
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,320
he never existed i don't even know where

214
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,360
like the the like inspiration came for

215
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,600
him the flashy

216
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,720
you you that was on the spot yeah

217
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,160
because like i was trying to think of

218
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,920
like how someone could fall over the

219
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,600
side because by the way i have really

220
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,120
flat feet yeah they're like big paddles

221
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,640
with bunions and there's flats that

222
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,160
scene was so hard to film

223
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,680
i mean they saw it in the bloopers that

224
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,120
was broke a thousand times

225
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,880
and i practiced it so many times in

226
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,880
front of so many people and then once we

227
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,640
all sat in here like we are right now is

228
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,040
in this exact room yeah guy just

229
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,200
couldn't

230
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,320
hold it together i was worried that at

231
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,920
the end of the dock

232
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,680
when mike flipped and said he was

233
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,519
spoiler alert that he was not a flat

234
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,000
earther that people wouldn't believe

235
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,760
that that people would think that was

236
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,959
the joke so we overacted it

237
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,279
with the little underlying hint that

238
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,800
like

239
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,160
you're [ __ ] around with everyone i

240
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,360
think well i think once people heard

241
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,680
pete go over the side

242
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,959
that they like the majority of people

243
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,360
right there were like yo there's no

244
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,440
there's

245
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,959
absolutely no [ __ ] way this is true

246
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,120
logan paul was

247
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,760
punking everyone at flat earthers

248
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,880
expense this was a great big punk on the

249
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,399
entire internet

250
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,079
because everyone was falling for this

251
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,800
that oh my goodness he's he's becoming a

252
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,600
flat earther

253
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,720
this is my favorite part about this

254
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,560
documentary like

255
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,160
part of the reason i made it it sounds

256
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,560
bad it was kind of like a

257
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,440
like a [ __ ] you in a way everyone in

258
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,360
today's society is so quick to hop on

259
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,120
the train whichever way it's going

260
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,880
especially if the terrain involves

261
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,959
hating logan paul that's like a

262
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,640
fun thing to do nowadays so this was my

263
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,480
way of tricking

264
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,399
every single person who wanted to hate

265
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,440
me we did dupe the internet i got duped

266
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,920

and refused to acknowledge me as part of

285
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,640
the

286
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:06,480
society but the flat earth society what

287
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,360
the real flat earth is called we found

288
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,279
this out

289
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,880
controlled opposition the flatter

290
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,200
society aren't even the real flat

291
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,959
earthers but now i'm sucked into this

292
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,440
like weird spot where do i try to

293
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:19,200
explain to like the real world

294
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,880
that the flatter society is separate

295
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,040
from the real flat earthers and

296
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,480
even be involved with these people

297
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,079
anymore like i don't know it was just it

298
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,000
was so confusing it was like you got

299
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,519
uninvited to a party that you didn't

300
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,040
want to be at yes exactly

301
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,880
yeah they were just like yes i don't

302
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,839
want to be part of the [ __ ] group i

303
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,000
want to talk about

304
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,680
the backlash we're getting it's minor

305
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
the backlash i thought i was going to

306
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,760
get

307
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,160
was the media coming out and saying

308
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,560
logan paul is perpetuating

309
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,320
ignorance by even spreading this fable

310
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,760
that the earth is indeed shaped like a

311
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,120
pancake floating through space

312
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,880
thank god that did not happen the

313
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,399
backlash that we are getting you tricked

314
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,040
the flat earthers you know you lied to

315
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,480
their face

316
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,399
why did you do that how do you feel

317
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,480
about that like the doc was awesome but

318
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,839
you haiky lied used and took advantage

319
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,519
of those people and they genuinely

320
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,760
trusted you love the doc though

321
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,600
thanks dude my logic was this if they

322
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,320
were if they're willing to lie to

323
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,800
themselves

324
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,800
and lie to the world try and perpetuate

325
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,880
this movement of idiocracy

326
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,320
i was willing to lie to them about

327
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,320
something that i really

328
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,600
really don't believe in like here here's

329
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,040
me coming clean i

330
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,240
really really dislike this movement not

331
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,399
the two my own horn

332
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,720
you guys may know i got a full academic

333
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,639
ride to college for engineering i got a

334
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,920
five on my ap physics test science

335
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,519
biology

336
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,120
facts i guess you could say is kind of

337
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,480
my thing in math too like i was a

338
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,839
i was a geek in high school but i

339
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,600
promised myself that i was going to go

340
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,079
to the conference with an open mind as

341
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,519
much as

342
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,639
and you two remember when i told you

343
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,120
that you were going to become a flat

344
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,320
earther

345
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,279
you were like no i was worried none of

346
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,680
these people were

347
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:49,120
like mean in any way like they never at

348
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,480
any point were like rude tossed they

349
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,760
were all really nice people and to be

350
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,279
honest with you like coming out of it

351
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,800
i've made a couple of comments to you

352
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,240
that like i actually did there were

353
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,000
times where i actually started to feel

354
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,760
kind of bad about the situation there's

355
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,480
just like a part of me that like just

356
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,399
didn't feel

357
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,880
great about it but at the same time like

358
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:07,440
they are like perpetuating a lie

359
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,240
to like not only other people but also

360
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,600
like kids

361
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,519
i i can't i can't fully wrap my head

362
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,320
around it and i was willing

363
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:18,000
to stand behind my actions for the

364
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,120
satire that we created

365
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,279
to hopefully spread the truth about how

366
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,959
like honestly really [ __ ] stupid this

367
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,399
movement is and to be honest i don't

368
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,760
even want to call it a movement

369
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,320
i don't think it's a movement i think

370
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:33,120
it's a group of like-minded people who

371
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,760
simply refuse education and refuse to

372
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,160
believe

373
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,120
the truth the flat earth gathering is a

374
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,839
thing

375
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,800
because a lot of the stuff they say like

376
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,800
does make sense

377
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,240
because what they do is they cherry pick

378
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,240
they work backwards not

379
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,000
trying to prove that the earth is flat

380
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,120
instead trying to disprove that the

381
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,120
earth is round

382
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,240
and they cherry pick the facts that they

383
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,440
want you to see

384
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:59,360
to get to point b while skipping point a

385
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:01,360
they are so tied into this belief

386
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,199
that the earth is flat no one in this

387
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,519
massive group is willing to actually

388
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,880
go prove it right like they're like oh

389
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,000
we can't go to antarctica because

390
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,000
there's this rogue

391
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,760
nasa force that will stop us at the

392
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,199
border so we can't go there to

393
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,800
prove that there's this ice shell but if

394
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,720
you've devoted your like this robbie

395
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,040
davidson has devoted his entire life to

396
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,959
it

397
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,480
like go like go there someone do

398
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,000
something someone with a camera

399
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,240
be the patriot with a with a hidden

400
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
camera and and show us that you've been

401
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,639
stopped by this rogue

402
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,320
force of of government you know that

403
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,240
that won't let you pass

404
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,519
here's why it gets tricky like these

405
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,440
flat earth believers

406
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,639
it's bigger than just them believing in

407
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,360
the flat earth they don't believe in

408
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,120
anything they

409
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,199
they question everything but this is the

410
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,279
first movie all scripted

411
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,800
all acted from start to finish the

412
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,680
entire thing was a comedy that's what

413
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,279
i'm saying

414
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,240
that's proof robbie was we wrote him in

415
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,000
he's our protagonist

416
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,920
the way it works is there's a few of

417
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,639
them can speak well

418
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,120
and articulate and do have like a really

419
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,199
high

420
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,639
functioning level of intelligence and

421
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,399
they're the ones that are the speakers

422
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,120
for example this guy rick hummer he was

423
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,040
the master of

424
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,880
ceremonies he introduced all the guests

425
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,720
and sort of ran the show the dude like

426
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,000
many of the flat earthers is just out of

427
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,920
touch we were um

428
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,600
in the parking lot talking with uh

429
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,240
robbie and rick and the dude

430
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,240
throws out yeah and he's such a such a

431
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,440
bag because yeah he went from the cubs

432
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,240
to the reds like that

433
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,800
so i'm gonna reiterate the dude said a

434
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,160
no-no

435
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:28,959
when i heard it i was like oh

436
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,399
and i'm like you don't see the cameras

437
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,160
in your face you can't really the dude's

438
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,759
not gonna get canceled the flat earthers

439
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,560
don't care they're not they're i don't

440
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,600
know what i'm saying

441
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:40,240
percentage this wasn't like a a

442
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,360
hit piece per se i just wanted to show

443
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,120
how ridiculous

444
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,959
all of this was quite honestly just

445
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,839
crafting a story around them they did

446
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,839
the work for us

447
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,440
and that's why it worked so well why do

448
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,040
you think flat earthers

449
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,800
are flat earthers and is there going

450
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,639
back say they changed their mind from a

451
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,399
flat earther back to around earth

452
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,560
i'm sure like they're just like a

453
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,320
movement of people that

454
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,839
do what they do to kind of like feel

455
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,480
like they belong to something like a

456
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,920
club

457
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,360
that was that was the conclusion i

458
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,959
reached yeah like just like anything

459
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,920
like that

460
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:09,199
anti-vaxxers like there's just a whole

461
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,720
different a whole bunch of different

462
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,120
movements of people that i feel like

463
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,399
they

464
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,320
are able to like come together it's

465
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,920
almost like not in the same you know

466
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,399
vein obviously but like a comic book

467
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,320
club

468
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,759
dungeons and dragons like people coming

469
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,279
together obviously this is much

470
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,120
different than those but for some

471
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:25,279
common purpose and like they've been

472
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:28,959
probably cast out by

473
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:31,120
by reality social anxieties they have

474
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,320
or like social like the ineptness they

475
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,000
have and they come together and they

476
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,480
feel like they belong to something

477
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,079
together

478
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:40,000
more so if they were to leave

479
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,759
like if robbie davidson all of a sudden

480
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,320
if the earth was

481
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,880
proven for the millionth time tomorrow

482
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,040
to like

483
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,720
be round robbie davidson is no longer

484
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,560
the ceo of this non-existent movement

485
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,160
like what does he do what do all the

486
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,440
speakers do what do they all do

487
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,199
at this point they're locked in like

488
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,480
sure stick with your guns roll with it

489
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,320
you're making money selling

490
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,759
200 tickets by the way to a flat earth

491
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,040
conference like go for it i read this

492
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,639
quote today actually i have this book

493
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,000

494
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,839
called how to win friends and

495
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,280
influence people this was crazy i came

496
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,919
across this today on the plane some

497
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,679
authorities

498
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,360
declare that people may actually go

499
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,919
insane in order to find

500
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,760
in the dreamland of insanity the feeling

501
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,600
of importance that has been denied them

502
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,160
in the harsh world of reality how

503
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,319
[ __ ]

504
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,679
pertinent is that they think this thing

505
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,919
people call them crazy

506
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,439
and the only safe spot is around the

507
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,039
other crazy people

508
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,799
the only thing however that they didn't

509
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:31,760
fall through with was coming to

510
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:33,520
the mixer yeah and and danny his

511
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,039
assistant apologized profusely said

512
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,000
logan had some other plans i did not

513
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:39,280
have other plans

514
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,600
no we had to get the

515
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,360
[ __ ] out of that place the conference

516
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,640
was attached to the hotel so even when

517
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,440
we went up to our rooms we were

518
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,120
surrounded

519
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,880
we had to like live come flat and live

520
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,240
with the people there was always times

521
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,760
where like they started to

522
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,440
seem like they might be catching on to

523
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,960
us like the second day

524
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,799
one of the lead speakers that was the

525
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,360
biggest thing his name is mark sargent

526
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,520
he was in the

527
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,400
behind the curve uh netflix documentary

528
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,679
which by the way

529
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,520
if you haven't seen that it's incredible

530
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,360
it pretty much sums up everything we're

531
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,120
saying he was on to us he found out that

532
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,600
i was there and he went on a podcast and

533
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,679
he's like

534
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,200

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,880
he was one of the main speakers and he

537
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,919
left he backed out yeah that led us into

538
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,520
the third day

539
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,200
when that happened like the last day and

540
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,520
that's when people started to look at us

541
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,360
like

542
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,720
we didn't belong there and as soon as

543
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,760
that started to happen like i felt like

544
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,360
yo we're in

545
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,039
enemy territory we have to get out of

546
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,480
here like it was it was getting bad like

547
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,360
people were starting to like say things

548
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,559
to us yeah

549
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,480

like three or four days it was so quick

558
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,240
filmed in three or four days but there

559
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,400
was so much thought that went into it

560
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,000
and i was so stressed i mean we all were

561
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,760
i'm so stressed out right now i'm

562
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,559
overwhelmed and i'm scared i'm scared

563
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,559
for my life

564
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:00,799
remember the uh the clerks bro they were

565
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:02,240
flat earthers yeah at the new hotel

566
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,600
you couldn't you couldn't escape them at

567
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,320
that point we were asking everyone in

568
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,000
the city what

569
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,360
what shape do you think the earth is i

570
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,280
think it's what and she was like i think

571
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,720
it's flat

572
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,559
and then we went to that bar we went to

573
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:15,280
the restaurant and he kept watching

574
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:16,880
videos of like flatter adamantly focused

575
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,919
on this video and he was sweating like i

576
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,440
looked over at him he was just

577
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,799
completely like drenched in sweat and i

578
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,160
was like yo man like are you all right

579
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,840
he was like i think i'm gonna go back to

580
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,640
the room and he stood up and he started

581
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,039
walking down the hall

582
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,559
you know when you stand up and you blood

583
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:30,400
rushes to your head yeah and

584
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,840
there's like little clouds circle clouds

585
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,559
around your eyes but normally it goes

586
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,120
away the

587
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,240
circle of color kept getting smaller and

588
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,679
smaller and smaller

589
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,840
and i'm walking down this long hallway

590
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,280
eventually i can't see i cannot [ __ ]

591
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,760
see i'm still conscious

592
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,280
but i'm blind and at this point like

593
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,039
this has never happened to me so i lean

594
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,840
against this wall and i had

595
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,400
enough strength in my body to to muster

596
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,559
one

597
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,120
final word and i'm leaning against this

598
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,120
wall and i go

599
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,919
i ran over he was like leaning against

600
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:02,240
the wall he was like

601
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,760
i don't know man i don't feel good flat

602
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,039
earth like just started like saying

603
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,640
things and he was just so

604
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,880
[ __ ] up i think like just all of it

605
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,480
like the elevation like lack of sleep

606
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,080
like all the stress of like making the

607
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,440
film like everything we made it around

608
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,120
the corner from the bar

609
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,120
and literally as soon as we got around

610
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,400
the corner he just face dived into the

611
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,679
ground like flat on the [ __ ] ground

612
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,000
for the first time in my life it like

613
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,840
was

614
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,440
out and so i picked them up i passed

615
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,000
that big ass off pulled them into the

616
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,280
elevator

617
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,799
and we were on the way back down like

618
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,240
the door opened some guy tried to wheel

619
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,880
a cart and he's like i'll just get the

620
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,480
next one

621
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,919
i like dragged him all the way down here

622
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,280
like dragged all the way down your room

623
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,799
this [ __ ] took a toll on me is what

624
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,840
we're saying like yeah i have never

625
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:38,720
passed out

626
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,320
in my life the flat earthers made me go

627
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,000
unconscious and headbutt it was just

628
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,880
like so much it's like any time like

629
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,280
you're like

630
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,720
trying trying your brain like that and

631
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,360
like expanding it and like i wouldn't

632
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,360
say expanding

633
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:54,880
i don't hate the people i hate the

634
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:57,120
movement it's almost even

635
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,799
dumb to talk about like nasa astronauts

636
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,440
will not give this conversation the time

637
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,520
of day

638
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,880
neil degrasse tyson he hates it there's

639
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,039
no point talking about it

640
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,440
well there's also that uh theory called

641
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,880
occam's razor which is uh the simplest

642
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,880
explanation tends to be

643
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,159
the right one the flat earthers will use

644
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,679
that in their defense and they'll be

645
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,679
like if they brought proof

646
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,039
of any of the stuff that they claim to

647
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,559
know like i feel like there's been

648
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,400
enough proof to show that the [ __ ]

649
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:22,320
earth is round do you still talk to the

650
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,320
australian girl that was in the movie

651
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,760
she seems really nice k spoon she's a

652
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,280
good friend of ours and how did you find

653
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,120
the girl who was also willing to pretend

654
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:32,320
to ruin her reputation for the joke

655
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:33,840
she trusted me i told her and like you

656
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,960
know sometimes when people trust me you

657
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,400
get [ __ ]

658
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,480
in this scenario it worked out pretty

659
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,640
well she was good too

660
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,720
she's never acted before the majority of

661
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,159
times it was you believed it too much

662
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,520
you're like i need you to actually tone

663
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,440
it down because no one's gonna believe

664
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:51,760
it at the end yeah you know what's funny

665
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:54,320
hearing robbie describe our storyline

666
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,520
yeah after the fact but really it was

667
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,120
part of the storyline

668
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,559
he was literally coming out as a flat

669
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,240
earther in his character

670
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,600
because he loved this australian girl

671
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,880
right that's another question we got

672
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,559
were you nervous to speak in front of

673
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,400
the flat earth society they aren't the

674
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,760
flat earth society that's

675
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,600
that's the difference like it's i just

676
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,200
so dumb explaining i was a little

677
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,120
nervous and not because of public

678
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,880
speaking aspect i actually love public

679
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,760
speaking i love being on stage i was

680
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,120
nervous because

681
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,240
that was the culmination of the entire

682
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,000
five-page script

683
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,000
that was the big moment and i had one

684
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,360
chance to not [ __ ] it up and not to

685
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,159
mention not only do i not think the

686
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,799
earth is flat

687
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,840
i'm adamantly against this movement so

688
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:32,240
500 eyes

689
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:34,000
on me people who like live and die by

690
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,039
this belief i couldn't [ __ ] up

691
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,480
and i i knew i had to nail it so yeah i

692
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,640
was nervous

693
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,919
penguin you guys are oh my god the

694
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,080
human-sized penguin

695
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,760
we implanted the human-sized penguin in

696
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,480
a lot of spots in this movie somebody

697
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,640
asked like what the relevance was

698
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,320
there's no absolutely none whatever yeah

699
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,240
i don't know what i don't remember what

700
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,320
it was that got you so hung up on

701
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,760
because i was just hyped bro i think

702
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,919
that was when i really started to

703
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,600
realize like how good this project was i

704
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,240
noticed all the throughout the through

705
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,039
lines

706
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,720
yeah between that applebee's so many

707
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,480
different like callbacks to applebee's

708
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,320
oh this was actually funny you'll notice

709
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,480
on this script some things are in blue

710
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,919
that's because this project was alive it

711
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,600
morphed and adapted

712
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,440
so much based on what happened at the

713
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,159
conference we shot most of the stuff

714
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,440
all of the stuff surrounding it after

715
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,039
the conference because we had to know

716
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,520
what went down for example the first

717
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,039
time

718
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,559
the very first time the human-sized

719
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,400
penguin was mentioned was in my

720
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:29,520
interview with robbie just randomly set

721
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,400
it off the top of my head

722
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:34,240
in the ancient like jurassic times there

723
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,240
were penguins the size of humans

724
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,840
absolutely i was like yo i like that

725
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,200
let's [ __ ] implant this and

726
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,480
everything so it's in the scene in the

727
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,919
woods there's a human

728
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,159
size penguin head in the background of

729
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,520
the classroom scene in the music video

730
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,440
the easiest way to put it about this

731
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,480
project was it just felt like what

732
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,360
happens when

733
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,240
a group of people all start cooking on

734
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,559
the same

735
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,640
wavelength all of us were just so dialed

736
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,600
in to always be thinking about like what

737
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,840
the next like

738
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,600
big thing could be we had prep the whole

739
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,960
team there was like seven of us

740
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:07,760
we said yo do not break character ever

741
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,440
do not show these people that we are not

742
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,279
flattered don't talk too loud

743
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,039
don't say anything like we don't [ __ ] we

744
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:14,880
were we were so serious about

745
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:16,240
not [ __ ] up here like yo if you drop

746
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,480
the ball and you're the one that [ __ ]

747
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,240
this up do you have any idea how mad

748
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,520
dude we're gonna [ __ ] be at you y'all

749
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,960
almost got caught

750
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,720
uh the one day i think it was a

751
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,600
publication called the daily beast oh

752
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,400
yeah that girl

753
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,159
this girl came and she interviewed me

754
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,880
and she's with her little camera phone

755
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:32,720
and she

756
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,000
was asking me if i thought the earth was

757
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,240
flat and i wasn't sure

758
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,440
whether or not to come out on the media

759
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,760
yet as believing it

760
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,960
and so like you like halfway there i

761
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,640
have waited

762
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,960
like crazy you're like the earth is flat

763
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,200
because our feet are flat

764
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,480
and like let's see the curve just look

765
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,000
at it and she was just like this dude is

766
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,640
such a [ __ ] [ __ ] you know

767
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,200
she's just the ending of that was tragic

768
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,799
i was like yo the earth is flat

769
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,240
obviously and she's like do you have any

770
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:00,400
numbers for that and mike goes

771
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,919
are there any numbers in there or two

772
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,760
two two

773
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,159
it's more just one in one when you

774
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,840
combine them yeah i broke

775
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:09,440
because that's what i hear yeah when the

776
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,360
flat earthers talk that's what i

777
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,559
hear them saying for their explanation

778
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,240
that was like the first

779
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:15,760
piece of press that came out because

780
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,200
like i think a lot of people asked us

781
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,240
about like the marketing for it as well

782
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,200
the idea was

783
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,159
to use the haters in the media give them

784
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,919
a little piece of

785
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:26,159
something to snack on yeah some logan

786
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,400
paul hate the snack promote our film for

787
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,400
us

788
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,600
and then make them eat their words when

789
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,320
it came out and they did it

790
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,279
by the grace we also did a little bit on

791
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,120
our end you know we talked about on the

792
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,720
podcast pretty much every podcast we

793
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,240
asked every guest yeah for the most part

794
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,600
is basically just seed the story

795
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,080
and like let people run with it they

796
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:44,559
went live we had [ __ ] ksi

797
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,200
tweeting about it bro like driving with

798
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,440
a link

799
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,960
bro with a link to his six million

800
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,240
twitter fans and i was like yo this is

801
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,000
one i knew you know like

802
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,679
yeah he said something like uh did i

803
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,840
really hit you that hard side no

804
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,799
no you i mean i've said this before you

805
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,960
hit like a little [ __ ]

806
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:00,480
how hard was it not to laugh on some of

807
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,760
the scenes all the years i've ever

808
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,679
watched saturday night live

809
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,600
and watch them struggle through scenes

810
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,360
and like you see their like lips start

811
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,080
to quiver and they're like starting to

812
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,919
fall off like

813
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,360
i don't know how you did a lot of it

814
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:13,840
because a lot of your stuff was

815
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,039
with the flat earthers and me too but i

816
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,480
think you had more because you had the

817
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,080
interviews with them it's like when you

818
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,440
asked robbie about the

819
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,279
the human-sized penguin like i don't

820
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,080
know how you didn't break down this [ __ ]

821
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,320
here

822
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,679
i could break and it would be okay like

823
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,039
if you started cracking up when you were

824
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,720
asking robbie that [ __ ] he would have

825
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:30,320
known well no what happened was when i

826
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,799
every time i would

827
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,960
want to laugh physically i was in pain i

828
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:38,000
was in pain it was so hard i

829
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,880
tried to empathize with these people but

830
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,480
i just couldn't

831
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,080
how long did it take to shoot the scene

832
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,240
where we were outside the restaurant

833
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:46,320
so long in case you really rub it off

834
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,320
every time every time you said that

835
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,360
everybody that watches this movie has

836
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,039
like a different

837
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,880
line that makes them fall out dude it

838
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:54,400
makes them start cracking the pete line

839
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,320
or whether it's like when you when you

840
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,960
would say to the dude about masturbation

841
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,760
and we like oh no but like yo literally

842
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,559
the one

843
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,279
thing i could not stop breaking on was

844
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:05,679
you saying

845
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:07,760
casey is really reeling off on me every

846
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,320
time you said it that was another random

847
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,080
improv

848
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,919
yo let's just have you start speaking

849
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,000
australia yeah that was that was not

850
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:16,000
in the script you've only spent two days

851
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,640
with her and you now have an australian

852
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
accent

853
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,240
are you gonna do more documentaries in

854
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,919
the future absolutely we have ideas

855
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,240
they can't be like this one cat's out i

856
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:26,320
mean sasha sasha obviously continues to

857
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,600
trouble people sasha baron cohen uniform

858
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,200
or whatever but like more than anything

859
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,399
like the thing that this hit me on was

860
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,520
just like it doesn't even feel like

861
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,799
we're talking about documentaries we're

862
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,000
talking about filmmaking you know what

863
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:36,399
i'm saying like we we sat

864
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,480
down we concepted we came up with the

865
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:40,960
storyline we wrote we had a script

866
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,760
we acted in it we took things to the

867
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,159
next level

868
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,799
for me the success was achieved i said i

869
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,480
was gonna get

870
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:48,000
this i was gonna be happy this got 5

871
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,520
million views which is going to

872
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,279
yeah i also think it's this is going to

873
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,679
be a slow burn this project like in a

874
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,120
year

875
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:55,279
i bet we'll check back it'll be at like

876
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,159
10 20 million because it is a solid-ass

877
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,840
piece of content and

878
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,039
it was exciting and fun to make so yeah

879
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,559
definitely want to do more i don't want

880
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:02,799
to say the ideas yeah no

881
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:05,039
definitely not but look in conclusion

882
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:08,480
here's what you need to know uh

883
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:11,600
p p p was real

884
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:13,520
and he was i'm still [ __ ] trolling

885
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,120
i'm still in character they're uh we

886
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,559
don't we we don't think the earth is

887
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,760
flat that's the most important one and

888
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,720
that's the only true one out of the

889
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,320
three he just said

890
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,159
well actually you know what again i said

891
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,919
it in the dock like out like

892
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,200
there's probably no earth if you think

893
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:26,559
about it might as well not be

894
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,080
might as well not be but honestly like

895
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:30,640
with the amount of [ __ ] that i still get

896
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,480
in my comments and dms i do not think

897
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,640
that the earth is flagged say that with

898
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,760
100 he had promised me i was going to be

899
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,760
able to break character

900
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,360
sooner he was like yo we go to the con

901
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,480
we go to the conference you get out and

902
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,840
then literally you could go on the

903
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,159
podcast to talk about how it was all

904
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,919
food

we get back he's like all right we gotta

906
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:47,200
film like two more months worth of

907
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,640
content i need you to hold character and

908
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,320
like people are attacking me i'm getting

909
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,679
[ __ ] up by the media whoever like

people are coming on the podcast i got a

911
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,000
whole character

912
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:56,080
but literally the whole from the

913
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,679
beginning of impulsive mike was yeah

914
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,360
yeah just if you notice during the

915
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:01,360
during the impulsive scene

916
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,799
the wall of pictures is one picture on

917
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,399
it like this that's it this has been

918
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:06,000
yeah it's going for so long but i'm so

919
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:09,279
happy to come back out right now and say

920
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:13,279
i'm not flattered one last thing i don't

921
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:14,399
want you guys to bully the flat earthers

922
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,520
and i mean that like

923
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:17,279
you don't have to agree with their

924
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,240
movement i guess make fun of it if you

925
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:20,320

now you've got

942
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:52,080

943
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,960
