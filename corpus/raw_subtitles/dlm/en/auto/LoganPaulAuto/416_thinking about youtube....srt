where I'm at in my life when it comes to

150
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:46,550
being a youtuber and an Internet star I

151
00:09:44,059 --> 00:09:48,439
don't love it I don't love this stigma

152
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:49,249
that comes with being a youtuber when I

153
00:09:48,439 --> 00:09:51,170
was on vine

154
00:09:49,249 --> 00:09:52,910
I was the vine guy right when I was on

155
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:55,069
u2 or Facebook it was like the Facebook

156
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:56,600
star now I'm the controversial youtuber

157
00:09:55,069 --> 00:09:58,699
and not that I don't love YouTube I

158
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,170
think being a creator on the platform is

159
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:02,119
absolutely amazing we are we are

160
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:03,740
extremely blessed as youtubers to be

161
00:10:02,119 --> 00:10:06,170
able to build an audience on a platform

162
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:08,059
that is incredibly dedicated to to be

163
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:09,740
able to create and do what we want

164
00:10:08,059 --> 00:10:12,740
whatever we want but I just have this

165
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:14,179
deep desire to do more like I see people

166
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,709
doing stand-up comedy like I want to

167
00:10:14,179 --> 00:10:17,600
dive into stand-up comedy I want to do

168
00:10:15,709 --> 00:10:19,309
music I want to do acting writing

169
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,170
producing directing and I'm just not

170
00:10:19,309 --> 00:10:22,399
sure if being a vlogger for the rest of

171
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:23,929
my life will allow me to do those things

172
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,420
I don't believe you can become the

173
00:10:23,929 --> 00:10:28,189
biggest entertainer on the planet by

174
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:29,779
just being on YouTube does that make

175
00:10:28,189 --> 00:10:31,339
sense and and I'm 23 years old I

176
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:34,040
definitely don't want to fall into the

177
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:36,199
trap of instant gratification which

178
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:38,449
social media provide you make a vlog you

179
00:10:36,199 --> 00:10:40,160
get views you get likes you get

180
00:10:38,449 --> 00:10:41,980
subscribers and you get money and I

181
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,929
don't want to keep doing what I'm doing

182
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:46,939
for those reasons I'm looking for a bit

183
00:10:44,929 --> 00:10:49,249
more of a creative fulfillment and like

184
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:50,990
it's so funny because every vlogger I

185
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:53,449
feel like reaches this point and they

186
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:56,300
all make this video I like I've seen

187
00:10:53,449 --> 00:10:58,730
Casey do it I've seen I think [ __ ] do

188
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,959
it it's me now god dammit I'm lost guys

189
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:01,550
and I'm not hiding it I'm literally

190
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:02,749
capturing my Instagram photo before like

191
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:04,220
I'm long and I'm just looking for the

192
00:11:02,749 --> 00:11:05,929
next step the next thing that I want to

193
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:08,389
do we did the Flat Earth documentary and

194
00:11:05,929 --> 00:11:10,519
as crazy and weird as that was I loved

195
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:11,929
it I loved making films I love doing

196
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:13,160
long-form content so we're probably

197
00:11:11,929 --> 00:11:15,379
gonna do more of that but I don't know

198
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,480
what it comes down to is it is cheesy as

199
00:11:15,379 --> 00:11:19,129
it sounds at the end of the day I have

200
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:22,009
to live what I've been preaching from

201
00:11:19,129 --> 00:11:24,350
day one and that is do it different and

202
00:11:22,009 --> 00:11:26,329
be a maverick and again I know it sounds

203
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:28,999
cheesy but it's true if I can embrace

204
00:11:26,329 --> 00:11:31,129
and not try to run away and go do

205
00:11:28,999 --> 00:11:34,519
stand-up comedy or try to like be an

206
00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:36,470
actor if I can embrace what YouTube and

207
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:38,480
the Internet has blessed and given me

208
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:39,949
with and innovate and make content in a

209
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,450
way that people haven't seen before

210
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,920
awesome different

211
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:44,840
I think that's the key I think that's

212
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:48,770
the key to the success and fulfillment

213
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:50,120
as a creator that I am looking for Logan

214
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:52,130
in the past two and a half years we have

215
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,540
built one of the strongest families on

216
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:54,710
YouTube it's not the strongest family on

217
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,060

218
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:58,220

you down so embrace and innovate that's

224
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,690
