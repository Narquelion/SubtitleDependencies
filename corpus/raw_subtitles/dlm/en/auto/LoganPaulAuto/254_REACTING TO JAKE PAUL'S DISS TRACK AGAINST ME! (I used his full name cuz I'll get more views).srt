[Music]

242
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:54,189
they're gonna be roasting here bro why

243
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:55,449
do you know gang we are about to leave

244
00:10:54,189 --> 00:10:57,279
but there is one thing I have to do

245
00:10:55,449 --> 00:10:58,779
first if you look up top way in the

246
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,889
corner that's a picture if you look

247
00:10:58,779 --> 00:11:10,089
closely it's a picture of my little

248
00:10:59,889 --> 00:11:12,579
sister back at the boys house the Sun is

249
00:11:10,089 --> 00:11:14,649
setting this is beautiful oh my gosh yes

250
00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:17,350
such a good time of day to start a roast

251
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:19,149
session you guys ever get bullied do you

252
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:20,410
guys ever have people make fun of you do

253
00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:22,600
you ever have someone call you out

254
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:24,970
publicly like in front of everyone -

255
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,589
hurts it really does especially when

256
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:28,809
it's from someone that you love so I

257
00:11:26,589 --> 00:11:31,720
just want to say I think a mistake has

258
00:11:28,809 --> 00:11:33,550
been made and it's unfortunate that the

259
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,679
beef not has to be unleashed because

260
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:38,470
this video will be the death of Jay Paul

261
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:40,929
I'm focused that's how I'm feeling

262
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:42,939
I'm very unfocused feels good I'm

263
00:11:40,929 --> 00:11:44,920
excited to do it like I have not been

264
00:11:42,939 --> 00:11:46,389

265
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,009
