house laughs hey all jokes aside I'm

55
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,940
seeing some comments on Twitter like why

56
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,920
is Logan making such light of Kong's dad

57
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,270
let the dog recipes he is someone even

58
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,890
said he doesn't even care the Kong died

59
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:31,140
first off you sick

60
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:33,209
shut your mouth second off I want to say

61
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:35,700
everyone deals with death differently as

62
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:37,200
you guys know my way of dealing with

63
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,239
pretty much anything serious is

64
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,340
deflecting with comedy is it healthy I

65
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:43,350
don't know but regardless that's how I

66
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,390
react that's my reaction I'm a human

67
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:47,790
just like you and I don't think anyone

68
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:49,470
is right or wrong to say this is how you

69
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:50,820
should deal with trauma so just be

70
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,680
comfortable knowing that your feelings

71
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:55,170
are valid and for everyone saying like

72
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,150
whatever they're saying about how I feel

73
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:58,950
about how I should feel about my dog's

74
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:01,350
death in the most respectful way

75
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:02,910
possible suck the fattest sauce from

76
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:05,610
district and fine now with that said

77
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:07,290
since my dog has lived a legacy and made

78
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:08,670
