and last night someone thought it was a

21
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,969
good idea to walk into my house and take

22
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:59,250
a nap on the couch that home it just

23
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:01,609

talking about the incident last night

34
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:26,130
without sounding like a [ __ ] it it did

35
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:29,450
shake me up a little bit it's very weird

36
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:32,100
having someone invade your privacy and

37
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:33,600
their motive being unclear about it

38
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,130
right so that's why that's why we got

39
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,990
the weapons I don't even know these this

40
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:38,070

45
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:48,659
short though but anyways let's stop must

46
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,369

47
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:52,500

48
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:54,299
thing it's not like a robbery you didn't

49
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,600
robbing things that I know you did the

50
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:59,520
shaking this is yo I felt bad that this

51
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,259
kid came across he came here when Greg

52
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,820
was here and honestly I think we just

53
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:04,320
dive into this here follow me

54
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:08,130
so last night I'm standing right here

55
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,590
around this area and this happened

56
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:12,810
there's a kid on my couch and that room

57
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:16,140
over there who I don't think I invited

58
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:20,460
over you know I have no idea what it is

59
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:22,920
yo yo y'all so it turns out there's a

60
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:24,120
guy sleeping on my couch this guy's you

61
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,830
walk over here I'll just show you

62
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,480
we made a tape figure so you could

63
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:29,940
really understand what's going on here

64
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,400
there's a dude just laying here on the

65
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:35,040
couch homie made himself at home I don't

66
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,800
know if he has knives or a weapon like

67
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,420
under him and even scarier than that we

68
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,620
came in and we are just from dinner we

69
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,540
were here for about 10 minutes and we

70
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,400
didn't hear anything like we Evan was

71
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:46,050
supposed to be here but there was no

72
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,640
noise so at this point guys we are

73
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:49,230
assuming like the absolute worst I

74
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,030
didn't know what to do again this is a

75
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:53,310
scenario I've never been in in my life

76
00:02:51,030 --> 00:03:05,520
what would you do I don't know but

77
00:02:53,310 --> 00:03:11,430

84
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,750
happened guys I I got dead you remember

85
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,340
when we were robbed when I was a young

86
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:29,070
dog I do

87
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,120
scarred me for life I actually cried it

88
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,260
was one of the few times I've cried in

89
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,210
my life the feeling of being like

90
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,020
there's someone invading your house when

91
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:36,480
you're out of there is like it's

92
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:37,830
disgusting to me so I hit a point I was

93
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,880
I lost it I freaked out a little bit

94
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:40,560
there's so many thoughts running through

95
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,750
my brain mind you at this point guys I'm

96
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,520
still screaming and Evan has still not

97
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:46,140
come out of his room yet so wheat like

98
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:49,020
the worst is going to remind why is he

99
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:50,880
sleeping so many questions and just when

100
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:53,130

101
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,050

00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:57,000

120
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,220
conflict chill and just charging his

121
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:42,190
phone well just the fact that he came in

122
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:44,390
the house

123
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:46,460
then we get outside obviously to like

124
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:47,660
file paperwork and stuff and they're

125
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:50,810
like oh you want to press charges

126
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:52,100
against this kid I feel like the kid

127
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:54,470
made a mistake

128
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:56,990
God knows for what reason how that

129
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:58,100
happened but seriously if there's one

130
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:01,610
thing I've learned in the past month its

131
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:02,990
forgiveness okay so like I don't feel

132
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:04,460
like pressing charges because I don't

133
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:06,560
feel like he came in here with malicious

134
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:08,750
intent a mistake I make hella mistakes

135
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,800
it's part of life I'm human I'm just

136
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:14,390
trying to do the right thing I feel so

137
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,240
yeah it turns out I'm a little bit of a

138
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:18,410
hypocrite I am gonna press charges just

139
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,760
because I thought about it a little more

140
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:21,380
that's what I was thinking about like

141
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,440
pretty much all today and the thought of

142
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:25,910
someone coming in and harming one of us

143
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,370
or because this conversation would be

144
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:29,320
completely different if we are gonna

145
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,550
press charges

146
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:33,530
we're gonna beef up our security we're

147
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:35,450
getting armed security now and we're

148
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:36,830
increasing the cameras around our house

149
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:38,210
we're doubling it basically so we have

150
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:41,960
like 40 cameras or other property

151
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:44,540
because this ain't cool tape man or real

152
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,850
man not the move it's weird to get

153
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:48,980
serious man I'm really looking forward

154
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:50,660
to the day hopefully in the near future

155
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:52,940
where I can just stop all this just

156
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:59,330
