got actually though I kind of have an

72
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:43,680
answer to this question oh I've been

73
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:45,480
saving this footage I would do a throat

74
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,550
doctor and she checked my vocal cords so

75
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,670
let's flash back to that footage to see

76
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:53,489
just how I am

77
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:55,910

78
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:55,910
your throat

79
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:19,479
yeah that was not golden so these are

80
00:04:15,969 --> 00:04:21,280
your vocal cords damn is sexy no vocal

81
00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:23,350
cords are supposed to be nice and sharp

82
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,060
at the edges here so this is what kind

83
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:26,800
of like normal looks like see how they

84
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:30,490
come together oh those are beautiful

85
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,530
Oh so for you to look at these

86
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:34,660
side-by-side your vocal cords actually

87
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:36,550
at the edges are not as nice and smooth

88
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,410
they're starting to kind of pay a price

89
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:41,080
on your vocal cords so you can see here

90
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:43,570
you see how they're not as like edge

91
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:46,050
over time you couldn't risk scarring

92
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:49,180
them at that edge no that's disgusting

93
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:51,789
