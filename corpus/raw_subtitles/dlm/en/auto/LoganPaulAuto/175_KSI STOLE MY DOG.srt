98
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:18,620
did where I proclaimed that I was the

99
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,209
fastest man on the planet and had

100
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:22,399
pinkeye many people thought I was on

125
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,610
that your booze and middle fingers won't

127

00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:16,400

134
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,980
pound my chest your man is let's do this

135
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,330
now if you remember the press conference

136
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:34,010
from last year in London quite a

137
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:36,500
different demeanor last year I was

138
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:38,330
sullen I was down try I almost looked

139
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:41,690
like I was gonna cry I wasn't of course

140
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:44,600
no bro I don't cry I was just sweating

141
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:46,250
from my eyes no I don't cry bro so I get

142
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:50,420
ready bro getting ready for war and

143
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:54,500
speaking of war I made a world war 2

144
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:57,830
joke that's a shame all the support that

145
00:08:54,500 --> 00:09:01,340
we gave you in world war 2 and this is

146
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:03,380
how you return the thing I mean I mean

147
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:05,360
talk about turning a crowd on you right

148
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:07,130
away I can tell you honestly like I

149
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,260
didn't care they were trying to throw

150
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:10,550
things like you'll see projectiles and

151
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:13,010
by the way I didn't get hit by any of

152
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,270
them I saw JJ get hit with a nickel I

153
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,560
saw Eddie her and get hit with a piece

154
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:17,720
of paper some went through like some

155
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,190
glass holder at me I'm a boxer now but

156
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,050
like a bob and weave good luck but yeah

157
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:22,850
I was ready to make some jokes today and

158
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:25,520
then JJ came in so man comes walking up

159
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:28,730
the stairs and I see this little puffy

160
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:30,980
little dog if I was JJ I would have done

161
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:33,650
this however I can't do that cuz if I

162
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:36,020
brought a little dog onstage with the

163
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:38,270
amount of noise there was PETA would rip

164
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:40,760
my head off but I figured he would so

165
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:43,070
again immediate neutralization brought a

166
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,660
dog treat gave it to him but he hits it

167
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:46,040
out of my hand so the dog the dog is

168
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:48,080
terrified the dog can't even eat the

169
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,670
tree and I just noticed his dog shaking

170
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,350
so I I just wanted him

171
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:53,060
kind of cut the joke okay I get it is

172
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:54,680
funny but also the animals terrified

173
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:56,660
point is the man is predictable

174
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,820
he's a predictable boxer he's a

175
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:00,500
predictable showman everything this year

176
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:02,690
that he wants or thinks he wants to do

177
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,520
I'm ten steps ahead I can assure you I'm

178
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:05,600
playing chess man's playing checkers

179
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:08,240
you know why also I didn't like this

180
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,310
because I saw in a podcast JJ said this

181
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,620
I am human as well yeah if right who's

182
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:15,500
your dog it's like losing a baby yeah it

00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:24,590
it's inhumane inhumane I mean bro how

186
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:30,080
can you say that and then do this at the

187
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:31,760
first press conference I feel like this

188
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:34,610
year compared to last year I was

189
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:37,790
insulated in that there's not much to

190
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:39,850
make fun of me for last year I mean you

191
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:42,170
name it but this year Hong died

192
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:43,640
maverick died and then if you really

193
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:46,160
want to bring up Japan again but it's

194
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:47,900
kinda old news like and so I knew he was

195
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,030
gonna go with this joke even though in

196
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:51,950
the most hypocritical way he's trying to

197
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:53,930
pretend like he's got a heart at least

198
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:55,340
I'm out here beforehand in my interviews

199
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:56,930

00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:00,650
gonna try to install in him in defend it

202
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:02,810
also one last thing rest in peace Kong I

00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:09,260
love you bud I can still hear his uh

204
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:13,570
precious little bark sometimes jj-just

205
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:16,760
brought a dog that resembles your dog

206
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:18,320
majority said that I'm like yeah no bro

207
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,180
I think that's the joke he might as well

208
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,490
have been like Logan you're wearing a

209
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:25,370
turtleneck was that intentional but yah

210
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:27,980
shoe guy I'm gonna light your feet on

211
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:33,530
fire guy it's a light his feet on fire

212
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:34,400
and look like food orders let your

213
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:35,810
daughter's talk

214
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:38,060
yo this man forgot how to speak this

215
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:40,100
year you're on stage role on my Yasu guy

216
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:44,270
I'm a yah see you what is that like a

217
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:47,060
toss with the why why is your mom on the

218
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:49,550
cheek my guys mean [ __ ] I'm like the vet

219
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:54,080
I also heard recently today actually

220
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:55,760
that JJ swears on his mother's life that

221
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,860
he's gonna knock me out I swear on my

222
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:01,010
mom's life he's gonna not dog that I say

223
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:02,840
wow he must not value his mother's life

224
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:04,730
and I know that sounds bad but then I

225
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,500
remembered last Christmas when it

226
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:09,800
sounded like in an audio tape released

227
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:11,680
by his brother that he like hit his mom

228
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:14,150
[Music]

229
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,640
and that's why he got kicked out of the

230
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:18,110
house and banned and ostracized from his

231
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,670
family so the statement doesn't really

232
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:21,140
have that much weight if you're already

233
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:28,580
missing the respect you should have for

234
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:30,260
your mom okay so so he brings up Kong's

235
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:32,420
death he brings up to Japan he brings up

236
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:33,950
my parent I had something in my back

237
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:35,750
pocket that I didn't want to pull out

238
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:37,220
let's call it the red button so I stand

239
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:40,340
up and again I'm kind of just getting

240
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:43,090
warmed up and I say something about I

241
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:47,300
guess I should just dive in here

242
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:48,770
abortion tasers on his abortion because

243
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,360
his brother desi came out when they were

244
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:53,120
beefing and even said it on my podcast

245
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:54,740
that Jay Jay's on his fifth abortion now

246
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,090
the circumstance I'm about to describe

247
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,860
is one of the most interesting

248
00:12:56,090 --> 00:13:00,050
phenomenons I've ever seen online

249
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:03,740
I was very harsh in what appeared to be

250
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:06,590
my condemnation of Jay Jay's choice to

251
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:09,410
have five abortions and I said something

252
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:12,410
kind of just distastefully and way

253
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:13,730
insensitive about I think I said like

254
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:15,410
y'all I'm gonna kill you bro like I'm

255
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:17,300
gonna end you like you did to the babies

256
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:19,370
like it wasn't great in fact they left a

257
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:22,190
bad taste in my mouth even after I said

258
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:25,700
it however my rebuttal for that would be

259
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:27,740
that in the context of a fight where you

260
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,720
have two guys who were literally trying

261
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:31,850
to kill each other in a ring and getting

262
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,260
each other's heads this fell under the

263
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:35,420
category of fight talk which

264
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:37,940
historically we've seen can get pretty

265
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:39,740
toxic and stop and that definitely falls

266
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:41,450
in that category now this started going

267
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:43,250
semi viral on Twitter there was a

268
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:46,910
hashtag Logan Pallas over party this

269
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:49,700
might be an attempt to cancel me again

270
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:53,600
and I oddly enough understood it because

271
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:56,120
I said it in a chauvinistic hasty way

272
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,600
because I was triggered and I hit I hit

273
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:01,430
the red button and said the thing that

274
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,960
just didn't just didn't come out of my

275
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:05,440
mouth well now here's where it got

276
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:07,970
interesting there were a few

277
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:11,150
pro-choicers came out and assumed that I

278
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:12,440
was pro-life and they started trying to

279
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,640
cancel me and they're right when I

280
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,560
thought that I

281
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:18,290
could be fun like hashtag logan paul is

282
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:19,940
over party again the pro-lifers like

283
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:21,890
people with blue check and a decent

284
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:23,360
amount of followers we're standing up

285
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:26,210
for me and they're like hey i know this

286
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,920
is weird but like logan Paul's right on

287
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:28,970
this one and they use the hashtag Logan

288
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,290
Paul is over party but it wasn't the

289
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:32,690
cancel me it was to agree with me and

290
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:34,280
defend me and then Here I am like just

291
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:36,110
sort of confused if you guys remember

292
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:39,800
that a while back I had a tweet where I

293
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:41,810
drew tiny little dicks on the 25 Alabama

294
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,820
senators who voted to ban abortion and

295
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:45,770
it went viral it got like 150,000 favors

296
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:47,420
which then tip people off and I've come

297
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:49,670
out publicly and said it before I'm

298
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:51,800
actually pro-choice the point that I was

299
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:54,680
trying to make and it didn't come out

300
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:56,510
this way but I'm actually asking for

301
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,800
input here so please comment below come

302
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:59,060
I'm gonna ask a question that I would

303
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,310
love to know the answer to as a

304
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:04,940
pro-choice guy I'm wondering at what

305
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:08,300
point does JJ's blatant irresponsibility

306
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:09,740
sexually crossed a line because he's

307
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:13,370
using abortion as a means of

308
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:15,230
contraception that's the question and if

309
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:17,510
I'm living in a culture where I'm not

310
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:19,340
allowed to ask a question God strike me

311
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:21,230
now anyways I wanted to clarify that in

312
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:23,060
case he touches on it in his video or

313
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:25,460
anyone tries to take my words out of

314
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:27,320
context because it happens a lot and I

315
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:29,740
definitely figured I should clarify

316
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:33,140
after that happened I had to kind of

317
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:34,850
like press a reset button cuz I knew it

318
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:37,130
wasn't off to a great start but here we

319
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:40,340
go coming into this fight what is your

320
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:43,630
biggest strength Gordon against Logan my

321
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:46,190
biggest strength is my actual strength

322
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:48,500
just so you guys know that's what you

323
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:51,620
say when your your brain cells are all

324
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:54,080
of them have wet yo peace my biggest

325
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:56,510
strength is my strength I can tell you

326
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:58,760
with utmost confidence not a single one

327
00:15:56,510 --> 00:16:00,920
of his punches affected me in any way

328
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,280
last year I was tired actually you know

329
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,110
what

330
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:05,030
nah yeah I'm done saying that I wasn't

331
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:06,920
tired I was excited I things I 'ti got

332
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:08,780
to me the crowd sucked my energy I was

333
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:12,830
chilly but the point is the mascot knows

334
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:15,170
my bit much I have the power you don't

335
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:17,810
have power you couldn't knock me out

336
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:20,330
would knock me down you had a guard on

337
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:23,720
you idiot says I don't have power

338
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:25,970
have you seen this oh oh I mean what's

339
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,290
good bro you say these things and then

340
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:29,870
makes me think that's you're a [ __ ]

341
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:31,910
you're sparring too much and I think

342
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:34,579
you're getting hit in the head too much

343
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:35,420
I think you should take a nap dude good

344
00:16:34,579 --> 00:16:37,009
to go take a nap

345
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:39,199
so the Geordi asked me what is your

346
00:16:37,009 --> 00:16:45,740
biggest strength coming into this fight

347
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:47,420
I know how to box now surprise turns out

348
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:49,339
I'm pretty good when you give me more

349
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:51,470
than three months and this face I mean

350
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:53,060
what's left under the bandana in the

351
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:55,699
hair is there anything inside the

352
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:57,110
cranium it's so clear to me just just

353
00:16:55,699 --> 00:16:59,389
like the LA press conference he's

354
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:01,490
already defeated I mean it's done again

355
00:16:59,389 --> 00:17:03,379
look at body language I'm standing up

356
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:05,569
this whole time I'm ready I'm ready to

357
00:17:03,379 --> 00:17:07,610
go to war and he's just soft over in his

358
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:09,380
seat shoulders hunched in his home

359
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:10,789
country next to his to his coaches

360
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:12,679

416
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:56,820

big Gib Gib

430

is his name they're trying to bring up

431
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:28,590
this kid because they want him to fight

432
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:30,150
Jake and I think actually Jake wants to

433
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:31,800
fight him too so hopefully they have

434
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:33,330
they have it they strike a deal with the

435
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:36,000
zone and matt reum boxing so this kid

436
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:39,510

that big girl I love I'm trying to say

440
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:56,710
this from such an unbiased perspective

441
00:20:54,370 --> 00:21:00,010
no matter any of the stuff Jake's done

442
00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:02,290
in the past this man is so entertaining

443
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:04,420
he goes off immediately he calls him a

444
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:06,190

he's been on the stage the whole time

450
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:21,190

00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,780
Goonies like they keep him chained up

452
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:24,460

455
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:32,910

every time we've done a face-off I've

520
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:13,909
been I've been like talking to him and

521
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:16,850
this time I figured I am going to look

522
00:24:13,909 --> 00:24:19,210
as stoic and hard as I possibly can this

523
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:23,299
whole time that I was stared at him I

524
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:26,659
did not breathe I've never been this

525
00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:29,899
locked in or focused in my life I swear

526
00:24:26,659 --> 00:24:32,899
to God I cut all the games and I'm

527
00:24:29,899 --> 00:24:34,789
looking at him and he understands that

528
00:24:32,899 --> 00:24:37,010
I'm very serious about this he's trying

529
00:24:34,789 --> 00:24:39,049
to play it off and be cool his neck vein

530
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:43,010
starts popping out and I'm looking at

531
00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:45,020
this man and I can see his soul I swear

532
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:47,570
to God I could see through his skull I'm

533
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:49,580

534
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:52,130
thoughts like I'm so focused right now

535
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:54,230

00:24:57,169 --> 00:25:02,780
then JJ and his uh final attempt to do

539
00:24:59,929 --> 00:25:05,140
anything he lifts his arms up I lift my

540
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:08,000
arms up first off look at how I mean

541
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:10,340
bigger than him my arms are longer

542
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,380
I'm mad at myself that I didn't grab his

543
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:13,760
hips and whisper in his ear I'll never

544
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:16,160
let go like we could have had a full-on

545
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:18,410
nice Titanic moment so I go to get

546
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,370
offstage give JJ a final goodbye do a

547
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:22,370
spin

548
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:23,690
DAP up that psych dab out of him and

549
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:24,980
then he's obviously pissed at this point

550
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:26,930
like you see his neck veins popping out

551
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:32,270
everything so he comes back on for final

552
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:33,560
sign-off but I mean bro you're the only

553
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:35,030
