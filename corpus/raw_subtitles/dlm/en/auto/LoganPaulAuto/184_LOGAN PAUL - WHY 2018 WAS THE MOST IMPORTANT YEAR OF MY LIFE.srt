[Applause]

00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:12,460
where's no juice

00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:30,200
[Music]

4
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:31,850
hey what's up that's me load money good

5
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,620
night I used to be a regular kid from

6
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:35,480
Ohio you know I love sports I paid

7
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:39,289
attention in school it was always a bit

8
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:41,660
awkward but then when I was about 10

9
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:50,239
years old I picked up a video camera and

10
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:53,059
became Logan Paul butt heads yep I've

11
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:59,899
always been a bit of a troublemaker fast

12
00:00:53,059 --> 00:01:01,540
forward this was me in 2016 which ended

13
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:04,840
up being the best year of my life

14
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,840
[Music]

15
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:29,729
then this was me in 2017 which was an

16
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:32,909
even better year of my life so what the

17
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:34,649
[ __ ] happened in 2018 that made the

18
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:37,380
world quiver when they heard the words

19
00:01:34,649 --> 00:01:40,170
Logan Paul and Paul Logan Paul and Paul

20
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,909
Logan Paul obviously you know the answer

21
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,340
but let's rewind for a second

22
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:45,810
after becoming one of the top vine stars

23
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,310
in the world the prestonby's vine by the

24
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,860
way I hopped from platform to platform

25
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:54,030
shooting viral sketch comedy bits some

26
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:57,000
of which you may have seen after about a

27
00:01:54,030 --> 00:02:00,040
year I have gained about 25 million fans

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,020
between Facebook Instagram and Twitter

29
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,600
and then I heard about this thing called

30
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:14,069
daily vlogging

31
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:17,310
[Music]

32
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:18,870
what people of the internet my name is

33
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,310
Logan Paul and welcome to my vlog

34
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:24,090
channel that's right I'm vlogging now

35
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:25,530
you get to see more of me I began my

36
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:28,590
youtube journey with a bulldoze

37
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:30,239
mentality I was gonna work my ass off to

38
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,370
overtake this platform with fresh

39
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,189
explosive quick pace and outlandish

40
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:38,340
content I wanted to conquer and destroy

41
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:41,639
sometimes quite literally everything in

42
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:46,769
my path the bigger the faster the louder

43
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:49,310
the better I wanted to make noise so I

44
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:49,310
did

45
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,070
we became the fastest channel to hit ten

46
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:08,740
million subscribers in the history of

47
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:10,780
YouTube and I told myself that I was

48
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:12,880
gonna blow any competition I had out of

49
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:15,120
the water which at one point became my

50
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:18,870
own brother

51
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,870
and that got ugly

52
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:41,439
[Applause]

53
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:43,150
and slowly but surely in my endless

54
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:44,890
pursue of more views and more

55
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:46,750
subscribers it was becoming clear that

56
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:47,700
the vlog mentality was getting out of

57
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:51,400
hand

58
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:54,519
but I did not see that here's what I saw

59
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:57,340
Oh Mamma Mia take a look around

60
00:03:54,519 --> 00:04:01,500
Oh Joey look so good at night boy just

61
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:01,500
dropped 40k on a presidential role

62
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:06,459
within the bags eleven thousand six

63
00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:09,340
hundred dollars worth of Gucci clothes

64
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:11,409
Oh is this solid gold solid gold twenty

65
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:16,060
thousand dollars it is yours that's my

66
00:04:11,409 --> 00:04:19,090
board the machine was beginning to take

67
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:21,850
on a mind of its own as my hunger for

68
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:27,010
success was growing exponentially so was

69
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:28,960
my ego the line for what was acceptable

70
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:32,400
it became more and more foggy and the

71
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,400
disrespect began to skyrocket

72
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,990
and it's not that I felt the rules

73
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,970
didn't apply to me I knew they did I

74
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:40,320
just didn't care about the consequences

75
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:45,240
if I broke them I didn't even consider

76
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:47,220
them no god I wanted to entertain my

77
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,720
audience every single day without of

78
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,960
this world content and behavior that

79
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,980
they could only find on local vlogs

80
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,460
consequences were rarely even an

81
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,460
afterthought

82
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:02,040
and not to mention I was the 22 year old

83
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,080
blond-haired blue-eyed kid from Ohio

84
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:06,150
with 45 million followers on the

85
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,130
Internet every single day my actions

86
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:10,200
were validated by five to seven million

87
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:12,330
viewers and as long as I wasn't doing

88
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,790
any harm no one was trying to stop me

89
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:15,930
now my peers not my family not even

90
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,900
members of my own team

91
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:21,029
[Music]

92
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,029
[Applause]

93
00:05:21,289 --> 00:05:28,620
and then in December of 2017 I went to

94
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:32,070
Japan it was the perfect storm of

95
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:34,500
circumstance ignorance ego and downright

96
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:37,050
stupidity the backlash against the

97
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:39,449
social media star who posted video of an

98
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:42,479
apparent suicide victim is intensifying

99
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:44,970
the video viewed over 6 million times in

100
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:47,250
just 24 hours in YouTube star Logan Paul

101
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,960
is facing the fallout after posting a

102
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:51,120
video that showed the body of an

103
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,610
apparent suicide victim in the backlash

104
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,430
was massive people and creators of all

105
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:58,860
sizes denouncing Logan Paul and this

106
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:00,300
video actor Aaron Paul sang Logan Paul

107
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,979
go to hell so many people sharing

108
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,080
stories of people they lost due to

109
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:06,660
suicide and some specifically hanging I

110
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,759
obviously as a person as a human being I

111
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:11,370
was frustrated and pissed off and

112
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:14,849
offended by his actions a hero for a lot

113
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:19,280
of kids is to logan fans and when i see

114
00:06:14,849 --> 00:06:19,280
that i care so much

115
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:25,980
I'm so disgusted how could somebody now

116
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:28,080
realize how [ __ ] up this is this

117
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:30,240
crosses the line and I am NOT surprised

118
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,100
that he would do something like this it

119
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,930
doesn't make any sense to me whatsoever

120
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:36,090
as a human being how about a little bit

121
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:38,460
of empathy like a normal human being

122
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:41,400
instead of being a [ __ ] go to a morgue

123
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:43,700
if you're that [ __ ] more big he

124
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:47,820
thought that that was a key thing to do

125
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:52,230
in less than 24 hours I became the most

126
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:54,450
hated person on the planet I had made an

127
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:56,490
inexcusable mistake completely destroyed

128
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:58,260
my image lost every professional

129
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:59,610
relationship that I had became the

130
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:02,220
Internet's favorite meme and most

131
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:03,690
importantly had my eyes opened wide to

132
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:13,230
the consequences of my actions

133
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:15,570
I felt every ounce of disappointment and

134
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:17,640
hate directed at me and while it was a

135
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:20,760
hundred percent my fault it was critical

136
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:22,950
that I felt all of it now here's where I

137
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,820
made a significant mistake I went into

138
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:27,490
panic mode

139
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:27,490
[Music]

140
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:32,680
being disliked was my biggest fear in

141
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:34,599
the entire world so and is scrambled to

142
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:37,240
try and reverse the past I asked myself

143
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:38,650
how do I fix this when instead the

144
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:41,139
question I should have been asking was

145
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:43,270
how do I fix me

146
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:44,680
I took a month break from the internet

147
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:47,289
and attempted to bounce back with an

148
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:51,550
anti suicide PSA in a donation but I was

149
00:07:47,289 --> 00:07:52,960
still moving too fast I didn't fully

150
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:54,520
understand the significance of my

151
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,229
actions the depth of the pain they

152
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,310
caused and was literally becoming my own

153
00:07:56,229 --> 00:07:59,409
worst nightmare

154
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,879
pretty much I know for a fact everything

155
00:07:59,409 --> 00:08:02,650
I do from this point on will get

156
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,080
criticism it will get backlash so

157
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:12,699
internet please don't use me bro crucify

158
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:14,740
me vilify me as I fell more and more out

159
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:16,659
of touch with reality I couldn't trust

160
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:18,490
myself I wouldn't send my team the

161
00:08:16,659 --> 00:08:20,379
videos for a review I didn't listen to

162
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:22,509
my friends and I refused to adapt my

163
00:08:20,379 --> 00:08:23,260
content it was the highest degree of

164
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:25,690
self-sabotage

165
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:29,120
[Music]

166
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:30,740
but finally after nearly running the

167
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,000
rest of my life into the ground

168
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:34,000
I received a blessing in disguise

169
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:39,430
you said before this fight you have

170
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:41,769
something planned is there anything you

171
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:44,560
want to say to someone out OSE Matt's

172
00:08:41,769 --> 00:08:47,920

173
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:51,490
wants it you can come get it take Paul

174
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:57,519
no can porn and there's a port I don't

175
00:08:51,490 --> 00:09:00,630
care I saw this as an opportunity to

176
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:02,709
turn my disoriented emotions into fuel

177
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:05,110
after everything that had happened since

178
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:06,970
January this was my chance to truly

179
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:08,470
truly take a step back from the internet

180
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:11,190
and focus on something else with the

181
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:13,450
unrelenting passion that I knew I had I

182
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:15,310
knew that I had more to offer in this

183
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:16,740
world and I did not want to let my

184
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:19,120
failure define me

185
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:21,700
little did I know I had been preaching

186
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:25,720

you work out you work out you deplete

195
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,209
your muscles you take your protein shake

196
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,440
and then your muscles heal and you're

197
00:09:46,209 --> 00:09:50,070
stronger than you were before it's the

198
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,070
same exact thing

199
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,980
during the six months of four hours of

200
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:01,020
daily training I rekindled my

201
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:03,030
relationship with my brother I fell in

202
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:05,160
love with a girl who absolutely changed

203
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:06,630
my life and I restructured my business

204
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,560
and focused on my mental health and

205
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:15,769
emotional growth

206
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:15,769

207
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:23,050
thank God for the people around me in

208
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,430
the support of you guys because I don't

209
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:28,140
know how else I would have gotten

210
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:28,140
through this year or out of my own way

211
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:35,020
and although the fight was a draw

212
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:37,240
whack is [ __ ] it turned out to be the

213
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:38,830
biggest event in internet history and

214
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,930
I'm looking forward to the rematch next

215
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:59,100
year

216
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:59,100

[Applause]

219
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:18,720
as I've matured this year I've gotten to

220
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:20,940
exercise my creativity in different ways

221
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,880
with the number one podcast in the world

222
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:25,740
called impulsive a documentary about the

223
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:28,410
Flat Earth which is coming in January

224
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:29,850
and I'm hitting 2019 hard by releasing a

225
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:33,720
show called best friends that I shot

226
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:35,280
with Evan an animated storytime series

227
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,550
about crazy [ __ ] that's gone down in my

228
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:40,260
life as well as reviving the vlogs I'm

229
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:41,940
growing into Who I am and what I want to

230
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:44,340
make versus trying to fit into the mold

231
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:46,890
of YouTube personality or be someone who

232
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:49,170
I'm simply not the things you've been

233
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:51,660
went through this year have you shared

234
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:53,430
yet on this podcast or on your vlog -

235
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:55,080
three biggest lessons you learned from

236
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:57,180
this year what's that what's the one you

237
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:59,580
share the one is slow down it is the

238
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:03,780
first thing that comes to my mind and I

239
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:05,250
can not point to that as the reason for

240
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:07,260
what happened the singular reason for

241
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:08,640
what happened but that is a that is huge

242
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:12,150
what would be less number two the

243
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,410
biggest lesson of the year lesson number

244
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,460
two

245
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:16,620
[Music]

246
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:19,200
listening happen what way listen to the

247
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:21,930
people around you listen to what they're

248
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,570
saying listen to your audience listen to

249
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:26,700
your friends listen you're family you're

250
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:29,220
not right about everything or Logan will

251
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:31,800
be a third one biggest lesson that you

252
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:33,570
think will transform not only your

253
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:38,610
business your brand your Empire but also

254
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:43,290
your life in 2019 and beyond I think

255
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:47,480
empathy I think I think being aware of

256
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:47,480
people beyond just yourself

257
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:10,100
granted I'm still young and I still have

258
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:11,390
a lot to learn and by no means am I

259
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,400
saying I've learned everything and I'll

260
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:15,170
never make another mistake because I'm

261
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:17,960
far from perfect and I'm nowhere near

262
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:19,970
the man I want to be but the best thing

263
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:24,730
I can do is keep striving to listen

264
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:24,730
learn grow feel and adapt

265
00:13:29,269 --> 00:13:35,699
now one year later although I can't say

266
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:37,800
2018 was the best year of my life I can

267
00:13:35,699 --> 00:13:40,100
absolutely say this has been the most

268
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:42,870
cathartic and important year of my life

269
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:44,430
this year and how I move forward will

270
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:47,459
forever to find the type of man that I

271
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:48,899
am in the mission I'm on I'm blessed to

272
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:50,310
be able to continue doing what I love

273
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:55,980
and I want to thank all of you for your

274
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:57,480
support and if you're like me and you're

275
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:59,130
ever feeling low like the weight of the

276
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,470
world has been stacked on your shoulders

277
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:08,279
even if it is a fault of your own just

278
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:09,930
remember it could always get worse but

279
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:13,710
it will always get better

[Music]

281
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:19,080
who knows 2018 might end up being the

282
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,170
best year of my life but I got a lot

283
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:23,920
more to go
