achieve your goals in life I'm feeling

151
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:46,910
inspirational that was quite an

152
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:53,209

crown I don't know how Ayla and Evan are

157
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:14,779
even still alive I'm a big guy there was

158
00:10:12,589 --> 00:10:16,579
a point where I was like yo I'm gonna

159
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:18,829
die but I feel like this is a good time

160
00:10:16,579 --> 00:10:20,269
to adjust this guy's as as this stuff is

161
00:10:18,829 --> 00:10:22,940
cooling down I just want to say if you

162
00:10:20,269 --> 00:10:25,670
were here at VidCon and in any way were

163
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:28,640
affected by that negatively I want to

164
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:30,380
apologize wholeheartedly I don't know I

165
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,420
didn't expect it to get that crazy I

166
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,649
knew it would be a crowd but personally

167
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:35,630
like I said guys earlier in the vlog

168
00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:37,250
I've never been like a youtube star

169
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:41,500
always like vine star facebook star

170
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:43,339
whatever and I this level of fandom is

171
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,640
completely different than anything I've

172
00:10:43,339 --> 00:10:47,860
ever experienced if you were

173
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:49,540
or someone hit you or I saw someone

174
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:51,000
tweeted me that they got like food

175
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:53,260
knocked out of their hand I'm guys

176
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,950
legitimately I am so sorry what'd you

177
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:58,780
say you know I would not be surprised if

178
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:01,090
they do I ganna completely understand it

179
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:02,980
it was they say that's a thing ya know

180
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:06,100
it was very irresponsible on my part and

181
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:10,380
I'm like I said I'm sorry I know I can't

182
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:13,840
like I didn't know my toenails here raw

183
