33
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:45,920

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,459
him and I'm literally right after him so

36
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,619
that home he goes sprinting up the side

37
00:01:49,459 --> 00:01:53,959
of the house without hesitation hops

38
00:01:51,619 --> 00:01:55,429
right through the fence he doesn't stop

brother Jake what I'm gonna be honest

57
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,819
with you guys I'm sorry to think there's

58
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:42,519
only one way that we can actually just

59
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:44,799
control call call it doggy on coach's

60
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:46,150
doggy Alcatraz so the theory was guys

61
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:47,709
you know Alcatraz is a prison like in

62
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:50,799
the middle of the ocean it was ocean

63
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:52,299
what's the body-worn francisco bay guys

64
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:53,890
only like two prisoners have ever

65
00:02:52,299 --> 00:02:55,629
escaped Alcatraz the ones who did like

66
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:57,370
died on the swim in so we figured if we

67
00:02:55,629 --> 00:02:58,989
Alcatraz Kong's will never be a little

68
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:01,269

understand my fault for being seen I

114
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:19,700
thought I was stealthy what the manager

115
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,050
texted Armani and she's by the way I've

116
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:23,000
never heard of this girl she must be new

117
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:24,500
cuz Jake's manager is the guy so he was

118
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,520
a conversation that took place ah good

119
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,970
morning can you give me a shot when

120
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,440
you're up

121
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:29,390
Armani says good morning and then she

122
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,540
sends a picture of my baby with the

123
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:35,510
thing over his face mm-hmm and she says

124
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:37,220
is that Logan if so I can guarantee that

125
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:39,500
this will not go over well and that's

126
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:44,199
coming from his best friends in there

127
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:44,199
[Music]

128
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:54,350

00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:58,010

Jake is I don't think he knows what's

138
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,130
going on obviously no one from Team

139
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:31,480
Tennis told him but I think the dialogue

140
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:32,890
is that I just came with Andi to have

141
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,480

142
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:38,320
