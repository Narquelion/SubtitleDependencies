62
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:35,780

a mistake to try to fight me

104
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:54,920
I've made this appeal a continuous lack

105
00:07:52,460 --> 00:08:03,279
of my judgment

106
00:07:54,920 --> 00:08:03,279

heavyweight champions following the big

184
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:42,210
upset at Madison Square Garden this past

185
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:44,040
summer I'm talking about Andy Ruiz jr.

186
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:45,500
I'm talking about Anthony Joshua in

187
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,970
Saudi Arabia

188
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,530
Italy's as an underdog that's a physique

189
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:51,900
it's just nothing like Anthony Josh

190
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:53,910
Vance and social media look at and Ruiz

191
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:56,270
who say all that chunky kid what's he

192
00:11:53,910 --> 00:12:00,740
gonna do

193
00:11:56,270 --> 00:12:03,950
[Applause]

194
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:07,420
Andy's a type of bot ser Hugh - his face

195
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:07,420
he's turning a devil

196
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:28,809
[Applause]

197
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:38,369
you have an immediate rematch clause do

198
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:42,979
you expect to exercise that 100% now he

199
00:12:38,369 --> 00:12:42,979
knows he has to be that's the challenge

200
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:53,350
hey hey hey dr. C I had Peaks for other

201
00:12:51,579 --> 00:12:55,329
fights for this fight is gonna be hard

202
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:57,430
for me to pick and the reason why is it

203
00:12:55,329 --> 00:12:59,199
Natasha was a friend of mine and rohui's

204
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:00,790
came from the bottom just like myself I

205
00:12:59,199 --> 00:13:02,019
thought the boxing League so it's really

206
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:03,339
hard for me to pick I think what the

207
00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:05,439
best man to win this fight

208
00:13:03,339 --> 00:13:06,639
now walk out of there safe we still

209
00:13:05,439 --> 00:13:07,930
think that you think Joshua is going to

210
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,699
be the favorite in this fight but you

211
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:10,930
can never count out any ruins Joshua

212
00:13:09,699 --> 00:13:13,029
will be the favorite fight you can knock

213
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:15,129
it out the underdog never yeah this is a

214
00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:17,139
fascinating matchup and we are here for

215
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:18,579

been doing this professionally for

727
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:26,880
nearly a decade when you see this unfold

728
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:32,340
on that stage here today leading up to

729
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:34,470
the big rematch normally happens leading

730
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:36,000
up to a traditional boxing match no no

731
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:38,220
it really don't but I feel like they

732
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,750
selling the fight and I've played a

733
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:42,270
series I feel like somebody's getting

734
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:43,680
knocked out first round

735
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:45,960
they're both claiming a first round

736
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:48,750
knockout now that's really difficult to

737
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:50,220
say I'm not sure whether they go first

738
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:52,050
or the six but someone getting knocked

739
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:54,060
off the stone they're still done as we

740
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:57,000
speak they're still on the stage they

741
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:58,920
cannot be separated I can't tell if this

742
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,960
is an actor or not now so now they're

743
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:02,940
smiling at each other but it looks like

744
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,870
they're still insulting one another this

745
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:07,290
is this gonna stop

746
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:10,740

747
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:14,130

the [ __ ] was that he gave me nothing lot

772
00:43:04,299 --> 00:43:07,959
of trash that's the best he got I saw

773
00:43:06,549 --> 00:43:10,569
the fear in his eyes he had nothing to

774
00:43:07,959 --> 00:43:12,819
say he sat down what who knows who knows

775
00:43:10,569 --> 00:43:15,519
body language watch his demeanor

776
00:43:12,819 --> 00:43:17,019

taking this fight seriously serious as a

803
00:44:00,729 --> 00:44:03,729

don't care about that I mean it's a ring

823
00:44:49,809 --> 00:44:54,430
at the end of the day and I know I need

824
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:55,809
to do so it's it's old if anything it's

825
00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:57,400
more work for him because I know how he

826
00:44:55,809 --> 00:44:58,509
fights now a lot of people are

827
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:02,920
questioning how serious this fight is

828
00:44:58,509 --> 00:45:03,999
two youtubers are extremely serious and

829
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:05,529
that was a lot of trash talk you just

830
00:45:03,999 --> 00:45:06,880
say one more thing to Logan Paul before

831
00:45:05,529 --> 00:45:10,749

00:45:15,759 --> 00:45:20,380
lot Katie well really similar reactions

836
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:22,839
from both of our fighters as we get

837
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:24,339
ready for this rematch following the big

838
00:45:22,839 --> 00:45:26,289
press conference here in downtown LA

839
00:45:24,339 --> 00:45:28,930
Lauren Gardner ton partner here with you

840
00:45:26,289 --> 00:45:30,549
it dude I don't know I've never seen

841
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:32,499
anything like this this was like reality

842
00:45:30,549 --> 00:45:33,609
television and I was here just to watch

843
00:45:32,499 --> 00:45:35,710
it all unfold

844
00:45:33,609 --> 00:45:38,319
maybe maybe Logan Paul learned a little

845
00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:39,489
bit from standing standing because this

846
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:41,249
stuff that scene it Briggs do I haven't

847
00:45:39,489 --> 00:45:43,839
seen it in a very long time I don't know

848
00:45:41,249 --> 00:45:46,509
what to do with my president imagine

849
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:48,759
what's going on I think he was saying

850
00:45:46,509 --> 00:45:50,769
it's all part of a slate of fights right

851
00:45:48,759 --> 00:45:53,380
here on his own starting tonight with

852
00:45:50,769 --> 00:45:55,359
Jaime Mangia we have Triple D triple G

853
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:57,819
rather we also have Canelo Alvarez

854
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:59,140
arguably the biggest name in boxing was

855
00:45:57,819 --> 00:46:00,730
just announced yesterday that he'll be

856
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:03,369
worth fighting Sergey Kovalev

857
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:05,019
and of course all leading up to the

858
00:46:03,369 --> 00:46:06,910
chaos night Logan Paul fight right here

859
00:46:05,019 --> 00:46:09,130
at Staples Center and the biggest one

860
00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:11,109
yet another rematch between the two

861
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:13,809
heavyweights it's andy ruiz jr. and

862
00:46:11,109 --> 00:46:16,620
Anthony Joshua I was there ring sighs

863
00:46:13,809 --> 00:46:18,480
ring side for that huge upset

864
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:19,980
msg it was absolutely incredible so

865
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:22,380
maybe we'll see an upset here we saw the

866
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:25,410
Twitter poll it was heavily in favor of

867
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:27,690
ksi so in your opinion Tevin if you had

868
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:29,010
to pick a guy right here right now based

869
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:31,830
on and everything you've seen here today

870
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:35,220
who would you pick this fight I would

871
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:36,960
pick Logan Paul really he's taller okay

872
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:38,430
I had the advantage and I feel his

873
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:41,130
energy is crazy

874
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:43,200
yeah pretty Energy's yes and that's what

875
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:45,510
fighters need okay so it was more like

876
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:47,070
his demeanor on stage he took over that

877
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:48,660
stage he grabbed the microphone there's

878
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:50,160
no doubt that that guy who's been

879
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:51,630
entertainer he's ready he's entertaining

880
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:54,120

00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:56,130
place out he's ready he's a fighter he's

882
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:57,600
