00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,920
debated bringing this up but I just

76
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,750
didn't because I wanted to get excited

77
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,910
about the house of the facts of life if

78
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:01,590
okay you I'm gonna try to explain this

79
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:03,930
tell me if I'm correct yeah since I'm

80
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:06,600
dropping a lot of money into this house

81
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:08,610
and it's awesome we had inspectors come

82
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,019
to see if the house is up to par and

83
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:11,730
everything's okay with it it was built

84
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:12,930
this year no one's ever lived in it so

85
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:14,820
we just wanted to make sure that

86
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:16,440
everything was working okay everything

87
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,090
is not working okay most of it is

88
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,190
working okay but not all of it and

89
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:22,350
especially some super important or

90
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:24,090
advisors that are giving us all the help

91
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,540
are saying that we may have to walk away

92
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,760
from that

93
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:28,739
it sucks the house is so cool but there

94
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,650
are some like houses it's like extremely

95
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:33,239
improper structural faults and all we're

96
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:35,070
asking for is like the correct

97
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:36,840
information but we're not getting so

98
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:38,489
it's like you just trust that it's gonna

99
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,440
work and everything's weak because yo if

100
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:42,090
I'm standing unless this is an example

101
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,640
