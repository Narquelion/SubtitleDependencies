29
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,049
of you look at the merch bro Mama's

31
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:49,560
Cheerios like you know those golden

32
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:51,540
honey o's I wasn't engineered before I

33
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,790
graduated college I didn't graduate cuz

34
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:56,100
I was studying engineering in college oh

35
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,020
for Logan's crazy right never let's go

36
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,729
and I came up with this really good idea

37
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:01,409
to like combine everything into one

38
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:07,680
efficient me but first we need the

39
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:09,780
material teach you a thing or two about

40
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,340
the dog team okay guys so usually we

41
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,900
would take up one man and that's one

42
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,640
nice banana if I've ever seen we got a

43
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,530
full-fledged uh banana here I'm gonna

44
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,030
carve out the middle okay so if you look

45
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,440
with your eyes you'll see the banana no

46
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:21,750
longer has a middle go ahead and save

47
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,099
this stuff for later oh you're just

48
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:25,200
kidding next up we're gonna take our

49
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:28,200
honey ode and we're gonna stuff this

50
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,870
banana like a teddy bear oh oh oh wow

51
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,280
that looks good I'm gonna take our milk

52
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,379
pour it in the groove here this little

53
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:40,050
canal that's pretty much it we got

54
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:42,569
ourselves in one of these oh well if

55
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:44,190
buyer likes right about damn damn like I

56
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:48,510
would definitely do this in real life

57
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:49,950
not as for the long seen the stripper

58
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:55,470
