56
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:22,599
scientist in fact I'm just a ChaCha

57
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,860
vlogger from Ojai what we did a little

58
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:26,440
bit of research and we know we need

59
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:28,269
whatever the that is and also a big

60
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,250
big lint this lens we're using right now

61
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:31,959
like Brendan show how far zooms that's

62
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,220
not enough to capture the Sun we're

63
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:35,079
actually going to the camera store right

64
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:37,750
now before the airport we are gonna get

65
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:41,890
just a big cougar see like long dead

66
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:43,900
just like what in just a lens

67
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:47,650
risa barely underestimate how big this

68
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:54,160
oh I'll just wait dude I do pro-q like

69
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:56,889
you could you can carry it I thought I

70
00:03:54,160 --> 00:04:03,010
told you about that no fortune thousand

71
00:03:56,889 --> 00:04:05,139

this eclipse better than I'm excited

73
00:04:05,139 --> 00:04:08,920
probably we could make history this

74
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:11,019
could be mean drugs this contingent I

75
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,639
just know this is work by the way guys

76
00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:13,989
asking this guy to like stay here and

77
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:18,400
wait for us was the hardest thing to

78
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:20,979
like communicate hi yeah it really

79
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,630
talked along is a weird dog like a bit

80
00:04:20,979 --> 00:04:23,490
like what dog likes this I don't even

81
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:26,200

82
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:27,850
he loves it I don't know this Kong is

83
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,200
registered actually as a service dog I

84
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,940
don't know we got that because I don't

85
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,740
really have like many problems besides

86
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,389
the fact that my ego is too big I'm

87
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,800
colorblind I have flat feet my vision

88
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:37,210
horrible I suck at geography and I'm

89
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,620
just an overall sure it's good because

90
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,930
we can take it one place it's efficient

91
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:43,930
lots of services dog cause named Kong

92
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:45,550

for some reason whenever at the airport

I think it's knobby I get stopped every

100
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:06,010
time with the TSA and they have to check

101
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:07,840
