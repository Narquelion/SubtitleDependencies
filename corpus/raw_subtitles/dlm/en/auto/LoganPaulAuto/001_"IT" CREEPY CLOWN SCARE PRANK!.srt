152
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:08,470
bad day for filming inside the stores

153
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,150
and like I feel like it shouldn't be

154
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:13,600
this hard to get a clown costume but

155
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:16,350
okay just take a day back it's gonna be

156
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,350
worth it let's give up

157
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:33,070
you know what else I was thinking always

158
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,229
good to have flowers at the house so the

159
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:36,640
ladies I'm saying you never know when a

160
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:38,229
girl is gonna come over and you're gonna

161
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:48,570

162
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:48,570

right here like this is freaking weird I

166
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:04,450
didn't used to think balloons were

167
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:10,510
creepy right until you saw the movie and

168
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:13,240
then the balloons like for a second got

169
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:17,650
the Roses you never know

170
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:19,270

174
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:26,770
and the shoes as well this is gonna be a

175
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:28,210
scary costume where I actually invited a

176
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:30,600

177
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:33,400

where that she just sent me this video

181
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:46,810

182
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:49,110
the day what's she doing I got a text

183
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:50,670
