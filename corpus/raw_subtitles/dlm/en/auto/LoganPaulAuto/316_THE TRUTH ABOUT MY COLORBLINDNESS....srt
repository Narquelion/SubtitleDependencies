76
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:47,430
been meeting to make this vlog for now

77
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:48,930
I've been meaning to make this vlog for

78
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,700
a while I wasn't sure when the right

79
00:05:48,930 --> 00:06:01,830
time to do it was but okay listen let's

80
00:05:50,700 --> 00:06:04,080
talk about no it is a big deal it is a

81
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:06,270
big deal when I first started doing

82
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,830
YouTube I was at about a half million

83
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:10,140
subscribers which actually by the way

84
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:13,980
Evan is that right now and he's he has

85
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:15,690
like two videos out screw you wait and I

86
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:17,730
made this video called these glasses

87
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:20,430
cured my colorblindness currently I'm

88
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:23,760
looking at it it has 19 million views

89
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:25,320
I'm talking anyways I'm sure you've seen

90
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,390
the video but if you haven't the gist of

91
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:29,370
it is I got these glasses and they cure

92
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:30,870

93
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:32,940
title and that's what I made it look

95
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:36,840

[Music]

114
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:50,420
and I'm just sitting here like damn I

115
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:51,950
just started YouTube why am i the center

116
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:53,480
of attack right now because the worst

117
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:56,810
part about it I'm just gonna say right

118
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:58,820
now I am color blind however there were

119
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:01,850
some things I did in the video where I

120
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:04,040
made a mistake and opened the doors for

121
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:07,820
getting made fun of so like your birds

122
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:11,720
just one color to you what your bird is

123
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:13,070
just one color yeah to you what what

124
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,420
you're saying but he's like four

125
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:17,330
different colors he's all of those

126
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:21,290
colors he's orange red yellow maverick

127
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:23,480
yeah my bird your bird man whose burden

128
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:26,780
we'll be talking about maverick is

129
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:29,600
yellow I know for a fact maverick is not

130
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:31,820
all yellow for a fact I put that in the

131
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,130
video thinking people would a hundred

132
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:36,110
percent take that as a joke because in

133
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:38,390
the vlog I made it very clear that I'm

134
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:39,320
red green colorblind which by the way if

135
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,789
you don't know what that means I'll

136
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,220
explain it in a second here this is you

137
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:44,960
time that was one second so a red-green

138
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:46,910
colorblind bait it's not like I can't

139
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:49,070
see red or green colorblindness in

140
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:51,110
general means when a bunch of colors

141
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:53,030
that are like sort of the similar shade

142
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:55,100
are like next to each other and mesh

143
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:57,530
together to me it looks like a giant

144
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:59,450
blob anyways I said I said I thought

145
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:02,450
maverick was all yellow and people

146
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:05,360
believed me and that was that was a huge

147
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:05,930
point of attack for people I shouldn't

148
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,790
have said that

149
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:18,110
I thought it was obvious that that was a

150
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:19,760
joke I guess I'm just like okay yeah

151
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:22,280
first let me start by saying that whole

152
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,990
vlog I wanted to create an amazing story

153
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:25,670
an amazing piece of content that first

154
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:26,240
started by showing like what it means to

155
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,920
be colorblind

156
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,510
testing the glasses seeing if they kind

157
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,100
of work and then ending on a beautiful

158
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:33,590
sunset and looking at it with the

159
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:38,960
glasses on just like any storyteller I

160
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:40,550
made it a I exaggerated my reactions and

161
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,950
the colorblindness that's why people

162
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:44,870
thought that I was lying however I will

163
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:47,300
say this I did not lie I did not like

164
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:49,310
what I did do is embellish there's a big

165
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:51,140
difference embellish is like and what I

166
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:53,240
was doing in that vlog is you heighten

167
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:56,060
the circumstances or make something yeah

168
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:59,110
yeah exactly hi in the circus to see if

169
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:59,110
I would war still

170
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,130
you make something a little bit more fun

171
00:10:02,329 --> 00:10:06,170
a little bit more exciting but there is

172
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:11,060
a core any root of truth to it

173
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:26,540
did it work be crying it's beautiful

174
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:28,160
like like life life happen and then as

175
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:31,060
far as my reaction goes where I actually

176
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,060
saw the sunset

177
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,920
what those glasses did for me is they

178
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,769
accentuated the blues I've never I

179
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:47,380
legitimately had never seen the sunset

180
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:49,930
that intense and that beautiful so it

181
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:52,089
was it was very easy for me to to get

182
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:53,889
that reaction out of me like it my hands

183
00:10:52,089 --> 00:10:55,600
down was the most beautiful sense that

184
