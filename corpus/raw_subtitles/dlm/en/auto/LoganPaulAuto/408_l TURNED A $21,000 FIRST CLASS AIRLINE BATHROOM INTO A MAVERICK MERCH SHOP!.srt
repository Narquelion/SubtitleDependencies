00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:18,160
like a city to any given point there's a

75
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:20,709
million people in the mall that's at

76
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,209
once that's that's 20 times as big as

77
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:23,140
the city I grew up in yo this is what

78
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:23,420
I'm saying it's literally gonna be the

79
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,980

83
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:41,330
I've seen the videos I've seen the

84
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,920
commercials but I've never been in an

85
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:44,840
airplane where you can shower on the

86
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:53,840
airplane my only wish is that I had a

87
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:56,090
girl so one thing I noticed

88
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,440
scientifically guys heat rises and in

89
00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:00,110
this room it's a little hotter that's

90
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:02,150
because we are on the second floor of a

91
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:10,880
double-decker plane floor one and floor

92
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:12,380
two oh mylanta I hate you so much

93
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:23,240
oh this is I mean you're still in

94
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:25,220
business class Brad yes I was actually

95
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,169
reserving that space for Evan oh he's

96
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:29,300
he's actually doing it do you actually

97
00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:30,320
think I'm gonna make this much closet

98
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:33,380
room and they're gonna like peek over

99
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,600
the edge you do it they got a little

100
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:40,370
like beauty wait I have a question

101
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:42,380
you guys have showers she hits me with

102
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:43,789
the of course we do like like every day

103
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:58,130
you go out you go on plans that don't

104
00:04:43,789 --> 00:04:59,990
have to go what am i a peasant just so

105
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,800
much space look you can't do this a

106
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:02,600
normal plane

107
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,130
my only concern genuinely is like I

108
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,630
thought the Cubbies like we're closed

109
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:07,310
and I'm sure there are planes with

110
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:09,380
closed cubby they're gonna see me just

111
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:11,870
literally just building a merch closet

112
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:13,100
on the plane also I feel like now is a

113
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:14,060

like whoa I'm not hiding from anyone I

131
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:14,000

out how I'm gonna get the merchants here

155
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,719
