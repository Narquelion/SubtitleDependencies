123
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:51,440

126
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,080
being a little hypocritical because

we're going we're going to sell off

128
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,840
but other than that i think this plan is

129
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,840
pretty buttoned up

130
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,720
