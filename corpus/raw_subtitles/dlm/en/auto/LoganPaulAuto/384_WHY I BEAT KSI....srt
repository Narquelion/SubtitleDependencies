know what you're thinking right the ksi

18
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,219
thing is getting old we've been talking

19
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,620
about the fight for too long and I agree

20
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:38,969
I promise this is my last video talking

21
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,410
about the fight until we figure out when

22
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:41,460
the rematch is gonna be but I figured

23
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,770
it'd be cool to talk about what was

24
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,120
going on in my mind during the biggest

25
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,390
internet event in history during my

26
00:00:45,120 --> 00:01:00,989
first ever boxing match yeah bro yeah

27
00:00:48,390 --> 00:01:03,570

get ready to rumble dude like you see

30
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,400
I'm like walking out like trying to act

31
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,930
cool and stuff in my mind I'm just like

32
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,570
fanboy and so hard so during the whole

33
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:14,640
ring walk I'm not gonna lie I was oddly

34
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:16,890
calm yeah I had one goal it was to beat

35
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,810
the SH out of ksi nothing else really

36
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,250
mattered like I phased out the crowd my

37
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,869
friends everything I got in there I

38
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,729
raised my hands and by the way to every

39
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:25,710
one of my fans and Jake's fans that

40
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:27,659
showed up at the arena you guys were

41
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:29,490
absolutely amazing I'm surprised that

42
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:31,259
there weren't more ksi and edgy fans

43
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,670
there it actually seemed pretty even

44
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:35,430
they know they can't touch us

45
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,140
boo boo ksi came out wearing the full

46
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:39,540
mask obviously and I did not see this

47
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,700
but this is oh god this has got to be

48
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:44,130
the cheesiest most cringe thing i've

49
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,899
ever seen in my life and I'm I can be

50
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:49,939
pretty cringe like I've made some pretty

51
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:49,939
cringe content but this is bad dude

52
00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:00,420
he's in a horror movie he like turns his

53
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:02,100
head he's like here's the best part look

54
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,480
it I'm not even looking at him my back

55
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,770
is turned right I didn't even see that

56
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,870
we're just happening so then we're

57
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:09,210
facing off again I'm pretty chill

58
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:10,410
JJ's making kissy lips at me and he's

59
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:12,270
like he's moving him up and down it's

60
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,890
really really weird you guys know this

61
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:16,200
he loves to play the mental game and so

62
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:17,640
like still literally moments before the

63
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,080
fight he's like trying to get in my head

64
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,820
but again I had like tunnel vision right

65
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:24,030
now so no matter how hard he tried to

66
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:25,050
kiss me was not gonna faze me so the

67
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,370
bell rings we're kind of getting a feel

68
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,930
for each other he's thrown a couple

69
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:30,209
punches I'm throwing a couple jabs right

70
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:32,880
off the bat I learned that he's actually

71
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:34,830
surprisingly quick cuz I'm pretty quick

72
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,570
but he was he was dodging some punches

73
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:38,040
he was moving like at a pretty good pace

74
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:39,630
and again at this point my boxing career

75
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,730
I don't really know what I'm doing

76
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:44,040
but I did realize I was a little bit

77
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,540
faster so I got pretty comfortable yeah

78
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,030
big right hand right there but it's

79
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:50,790
crazy cause like I'm in the ring with

80
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:53,430
this guy who's this incredible

81
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:55,950
invincible youtubing boxing rapping dude

82
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:57,840
and like in the first round I'm big

83
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:00,060
right hand just I'm [ __ ] this dude up

84
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,530
so right here like ksi does this all the

85
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:03,930
time right there like I don't know what

86
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:06,000
this is or how after a year of training

87
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,560
you're still doing this stuff like what

88
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,570
these aren't punches man so there's

89
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,340
about one minute left and I start to

90
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:13,590
enjoy myself because I'm like damn I'm

91
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,810
quicker than this dude he's sloppy ish

92
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:20,640
I'm gonna have fun so I turn on the Jets

93
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:22,260
dude this jabs are so quick like there's

94
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,000
nothing he can do and I know that so I

95
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,680
put my hands down just snap these jabs

96
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,150
out bang bang bang at this point I'm

97
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,459
having so much fun like I'm literally

98
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:31,590
just smiling cuz it's my fight I'm

99
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,930
controlling it he's literally at the

100
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:35,489
mercy of my hands I'm such an a-hole I

101
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,660
was like shaking my head and stuff like

102
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:38,340
yo what's good like what are you gonna

103
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:40,260
do because like again this is not like

104
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,489
the ksi we see on the Internet

105
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,930
this dude's getting picked apart in

106
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:44,790
front of millions of people it gets

107
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:48,840
really bad right here big right hand and

108
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:50,820
then watch bang bang bang bang oh one

109
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:54,930
more time baby it's just a big right

110
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:56,840
hand and then it's just a 1 3 2 3 all of

111
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:59,790
them land followed up with another hook

112
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:01,500
this is where I stop and I should have I

113
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:03,810
don't know why I did this but I stopped

114
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:06,209
and I'm I'm holding my arms out like

115
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:07,460
let's go bro what's good and I should

116
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:08,390
have just attacked him

117
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,460
I coulda ended the fight right there

118
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:12,110
what JJ is good at what I'm good at - we

119
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:14,300
can both take hits we both got really

120
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:16,280
good Chin's what that she does rattle

121
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:18,290
you it does faze you if you get hit hard

122
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,580
like sure you can take hits but if your

123
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:21,380
brain hits the edge of your skull like

124
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:22,640
that's it so this is my mistake just

125
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,720
stopping like that that's not gonna

126
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,950
happen again in the next fight it's

127
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,620
funny though because after those two

128
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:30,230
punches right there you can see ksi like

129
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:33,230
just oh my god that's such a flush jab

130
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:34,850
uh-huh bang you can see right there this

131
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:37,730
is where he started to respect me you

132
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:41,420
could see he oh because after this

133
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:44,630
flurry of punches this is where I saw

134
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:47,780
his spirit break ksi the internet guy

135
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:49,160
became JJ some kid from London you guys

136
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:50,660
know before the fight we were going back

137
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,190
at it playing mental games whether it

138
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:54,440
was on Twitter YouTube whatever like he

139
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:56,690
tweeted me once you're a [ __ ] hole I'm

140
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,920
gonna put you in deep waters boy you can

141
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:59,030
do whatever you want to try to protect

142
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,430
yourself but it won't matter

143
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:03,620
just wait at Logan Pole and then you hit

144
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:06,560
him with these four punches one after

145
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:08,390
another I'm like are those the deep

146
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,590
waters you were talking about cuz you

147
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:11,510
kind of look like a [ __ ] right now

148
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:12,830
you're a scared little boy you're in way

149
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:15,110
over your head I know you're scared

150
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:16,880
Logan it's okay to be soon your audience

151
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:18,230
will realize you're all you're not all

152
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,210
that and then again it's like oh my

153
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:22,460
audience is gonna realize that literally

154
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:30,530
I'm playing ping-pong with your brain

155
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:32,330
inside of your skull ridiculous anyways

156
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,770
the first round ends I go to my corner

157
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:35,090
you can see my coach is jumping up and

158
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:36,950
down like a like a little boy who just

159
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:38,990
found his first pubic hair I'm sitting

160
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:41,510
in my corner literally like almost a

161
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:43,490
hundred percent energy feeling savage I

162
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:45,080
know I just beat the [ __ ] out of this

163
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:48,680
guy and I'm not just saying this this

164
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:50,930
was easier that any sparring session I

165
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,550
had this year literally so I'm sitting

166
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:54,290
there and I'm thinking this is my fight

167
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:55,880
this is easy work there's no way this

168
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:57,410
guy is gonna beat me I even said to my

169
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,610
coach at one point I go you know Milt

170
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:01,070
why is this so easy

171
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:04,370
I have sparred potatoes that were better

172
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:05,750
than this so second round starts he's a

173
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:07,400
little scrappy or he started to turn on

174
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,840
the Jets a little bit okay I knew it was

175
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,520
coming eventually but still I'm quicker

176
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,500
than him he's a little sloppy so the

177
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:16,700
jabs at land land land every time

178
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:20,090
there's two jabs right there then what

179
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:21,270
look what is this dude what is this

180
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:22,470
punch what is that

181
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:27,240
who wants to go pro he doesn't even know

182
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:30,900
how to throw a punch my god bro

183
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:32,789
it's just domination literally it's too

184
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,889
easy I'm quicker than him I see his

185
00:06:32,789 --> 00:06:36,389
punches coming from a mile away i watch

186
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:39,630
this he goes to throw the big right pull

187
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:42,360
back uppercut and then straight right to

188
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:44,970
the circuit oh and then again I make the

189
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,440
mistake of standing there versus jumping

190
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:48,960
on him cuz I was like almost like

191
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,490
patting myself on the back like wow good

192
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,370
job you're doing good Logan instead of

193
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:54,810
like actually boxing into the rope so at

194
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:56,669
this point in the fight I had full

195
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:58,889
energy I felt great he was starting to

196
00:06:56,669 --> 00:07:00,870
land some punches but still just bang

197
00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:05,550
bang there's nothing he could do to stop

198
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:06,990
me and then you guys know that the clay

199
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,400
through the clinch

200
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:10,259
that's my wrestling background kicking

201
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,630
in and in boxing you can do this when

202
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:13,919
you're in trouble or things aren't going

203
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:15,419
your way oh you even want to break you

204
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,710
can like hug the dude and clinch him and

205
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:18,690
get out of it and you can best believe

206
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:21,300
if I'm in a position that I don't like

207
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:24,030
I'm gonna grab the shoes to you and if

208
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:26,310
you don't like it suck my ass this was

209
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:28,229
funny Jordy was talking about how ksi

210
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:30,150
hits hard and there's like a four second

211
00:07:28,229 --> 00:07:40,139
pause and then Joe Weller is I ignore he

212
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:42,120
doesn't live internet Joe just had to

213
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:44,130
slip that in amazing but on that note I

214
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,020
didn't think he didn't hit hard

215
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,789
I've sparred due to hit harder but like

216
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:49,259
he throws big punches and when they land

217
00:07:47,789 --> 00:07:53,490
like obviously they don't feel the

218
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:55,710
greatest I am so disappointed in myself

219
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:58,289
for this so JJ fakes up and then he goes

220
00:07:55,710 --> 00:08:00,210
to the body bang he does it again fake

221
00:07:58,289 --> 00:08:01,590
up go to the body bang and then I should

222
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:03,210
have known there was something common

223
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:05,580
man it's happened to be in sparring

224
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:08,819
sessions this exact move does it again I

225
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:10,409
get whacked in the face oh yeah but I

226
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:12,419
knew he was gonna be like oh I hit him

227
00:08:10,409 --> 00:08:14,550
for the first time so immediately

228
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:17,400
returned all those so he hits me and

229
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:19,169
then bang bang bang three punches right

230
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:21,990
off the bat don't give him time to think

231
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:24,690
and then a fast jab quick jab again guys

232
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:26,550
I'm in like 90% energy right now I feel

233
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:28,199
amazing the pool backs are still there

234
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:32,310
I'm still striking hard and then you

235
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:34,979
guys know the bell rings this this dude

236
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:36,959
oh my God look I've always been a fair

237
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:38,940
for I've never I've never been one to

238
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,889
play dirty but this kid is a dirty

239
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:43,550
fighter man and this hit after the Bell

240
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:46,110
like sure I didn't do anything but like

241
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:48,180
what's good bro you can see like I turn

242
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:49,740
and I'm like smiling it's you know what

243
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:51,300
are you gonna do and then Jay cops in

244
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,500
the ring I'm gonna be honest I have no

245
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,269
idea what Jake was gonna do I don't want

246
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:59,070
he was thinking I will say I have never

247
00:08:54,269 --> 00:09:01,500
seen Jake this the word to describe him

248
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:04,740
would be primal I've never seen his

249
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:07,649
heart so invested in something like the

250
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:09,870
dude who is cheering and yelling at me

251
00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:11,160
in my corner was not Jake Paul that

252
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:13,110
night because remember guys Jake was

253
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,519
fighting desi and again desi man you

254
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:16,500
impressed all of us but we all know you

255
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:17,790
were gonna lose Jake we all we all knew

256
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,579
Jake was gonna win that fight brother

257
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:21,990
Jake I love you for this bro I know you

258
00:09:20,579 --> 00:09:24,600
were mainly doing it for me you were

259
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:26,190
mainly doing it to push me and make sure

260
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,560
I was where I needed to be for this

261
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:31,260
fight and Jake actually told me he was

262
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:34,470
more nervous and hyped for my fight than

263
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:36,300
he was his own so Jake bro you know this

264
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:37,290
I love you thank you man this dude

265
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,880
always got my back

266
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:40,529
even if he's gonna stop himself in the

267
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,630
middle of the ring so it's the end of

268
00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:44,010
the second round I'm in my corner and

269
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:46,380
I'm at straight-up

270
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:49,230
I'm talking to my coach I feel great I'm

271
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:50,880
at like 90% energy I cannot be stopped

272
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:54,060
like I just won the first two rounds

273
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:58,069
without a doubt so the bell rings right

274
00:09:54,060 --> 00:10:02,639
here I don't know what the [ __ ] happened

275
00:09:58,069 --> 00:10:05,880
literally had zero energy I was feeling

276
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:07,560
so good like invincible the bell rang I

277
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,810
was like what the [ __ ] is wrong with me

278
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:12,089
where is all my energy God just

279
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:13,920
dissipate it in a matter of seconds and

280
00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:15,449
I'm like oh it's literally it's the

281
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,639
beginning of the third round I have four

282
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:19,829
rounds to go how am I gonna do this like

283
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:22,079
look I don't know why the ref was taking

284
00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:23,370
this time to talk to ksi but I'm like

285
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,709
leaning on the ropes I'm literally like

286
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:28,529
I'm sitting there like oh this sucks I

287
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:30,600
don't know how about to do these next 12

288
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:32,069
minutes I'm dead right now and that was

289
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:35,819
the beginning of the end of Logan Paul

290
00:10:32,069 --> 00:10:37,470
so we start this is where ksi 1ups me he

291
00:10:35,819 --> 00:10:39,269
went like this like he was getting more

292
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:41,819
and more energy so I'm still in the game

293
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:43,890
obviously like three two big punches

294
00:10:41,819 --> 00:10:45,660
like who knows to JJ for taking these

295
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:47,339
and like like dude's got a warrior

296
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,630
spirit for sure that's the one takeaway

297
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:51,090
from this fight but again it

298
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:52,860
I realize I'm faking it so ksi would

299
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:55,710
land a couple I get him in the clinch

300
00:10:52,860 --> 00:11:00,720
I'm I'm sort of buying time and I'm sort

301
00:10:55,710 --> 00:11:02,700
of trying to get him off of me like it

302
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,710
looks like he's doing stuff right only

303
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,810
like one of those landed but Jo Weller

304
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:07,980
actually did a full breakdown of this

305
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:09,540
round if you guys really want to see you

306
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,880
should go check out his video he did not

307
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:13,140
land that many punches it looked like

308
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,550
because he was swinging a lot and

309
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,380
everyone in the arena thought like he

310
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:17,610
was the aggressor but he missed most of

311
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:20,280
them and when it comes to significant

312
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:21,930
strikes there was less than three so

313
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,280
about halfway through the third this is

314
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:25,020
definitely where the table started to

315
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,940
turn like check this out I throw this

316
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:28,740
big right hand bang get him across the

317
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:31,080
chin but he's like now I'm not done yet

318
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:33,660
but again he missed that punch but look

319
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:38,610
when you play it in fast motion it looks

320
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:40,650
like he lands it but I was robbed man

321
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:43,050
from this fight I think most people that

322
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:45,690
watch it back afterwards realize but

323
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:49,410
damn this sucks and listen you can hear

324
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:51,060
the commentators say he's landing now

325
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:52,440
he's landing now no he's not but it

326
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:54,660
looked like it cuz his hands are flying

327
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:57,650
everywhere story of the fight man ksi

328
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,650
misses with a big right hand

329
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:03,330
Jordie is so right he goes Logan's

330
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,760
looking a little bit tired now yeah yeah

331
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:11,970
man literally had zero in my tank I was

332
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:12,780
just faking it at this point so this is

333
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:14,820
where he threw me

334
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:16,110
I was not happy about that man for me

335
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:18,570
it's frustrating cuz it's like dude if

336
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:20,790
you want to throw me again let's do MMA

337
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:22,890
let's make the rematch happen in the

338
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:25,950
Octagon but I know you won't do that cuz

339
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:27,330
you're a little [ __ ] and you're using

340
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:29,370
your own words and you have to fight

341
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,720
dirty you throw me down in a boxing

342
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:32,940
match just like bro I've said it before

343
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,920
you are a scumbag of a fighter I cannot

344
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,300
wait to hit you so hard you forget how

345
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,780
to make youtube videos that's right I

346
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,240
said it

347
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:41,250
bell rings and around three look at me

348
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:45,780
literally bend over first thing I do I'm

349
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:47,760
like holy Shh coach sat me down yo

which I did I did tell him that all

355
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:59,730
through training camp we'd be running

356
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,500
stairs running whatever doing sprints

357
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:02,940
and he'd be like you tired in every

358
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,380
trying to be like you know a man I

359
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,820
thought I'd be like I don't get tired

360
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:07,560
but I don't know something happened in

361
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,270
this fight we're like all my energy was

362
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:11,610
drained so quick so I look at him I'm

363
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:13,350
like yeah coach I lied I'm freaking

364
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:15,810
tired now no you're not this is your

365
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:17,310
fight get up there and like so it's

366
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:18,660
round four I'm like I at this point I

367
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:20,520
got to play smart so I made a mental

368
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:22,800
note before this round I'm like I'm

369
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:25,590
literally gonna cruise through this

370
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,480
round so I can have enough energy to win

371
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:28,950
the fifth round and get that four to

372
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,440
decision pretty much everything I'm

373
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:33,990
throwing here it's a little sloppy it's

374
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,570
to keep him off me keep me looking busy

375
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:39,270
but this was 100% definitely is round he

376
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:41,400
just controlled it his sort of scrappy

377
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:43,050
movements and energy played to his

378
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,940
advantage here this part was interesting

379
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:48,000
we got in this clinch here and I push

380
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:50,160
him over and he like a like he's so

381
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,260
dramatic he puts both arms out and he's

382
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,180
just playing himself on the ropes you

383
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:56,820
can see my arm is cocked back and I made

384
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:59,220
the decision not to break his ribs I'm a

385
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:01,950
good sport about it next time I'm going

386
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:03,450
to it's a fight so I definitely should

387
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:05,640
have been an [ __ ] my pit what's my

388
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:09,330
pig doing Pearl Bingbing what are you

389
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:10,890
doing she's so cute that pearl Bingbing

390
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:13,140
on Instagram by the way so it's n around

391
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:15,870
for you could see I'm in the corner I am

392
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:17,700
dying bro like this is death to me if

393
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:18,960
you've ever felt this feeling before it

394
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:21,120
might be the worst feeling in the world

395
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:22,710
just completely out of energy but

396
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,210
knowing you still have more to do and

397
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:26,010
this is where the mental game comes in

398
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:27,690
luckily this is what I've been training

399
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:29,340
my whole entire life for fifth round

400
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:31,860
this is it I saved up enough energy

401
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:33,360
right away comes out of the back right

402
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,710
so I knew I was gonna win this round I

403
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,450
told myself again

404
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:38,700
if I like the fight was under my control

405
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:40,170
if I wanted to win around I could do it

406
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:42,030
the only thing I was playing with was

407
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:43,740
the levels of energy I had this is the

408
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:45,330
moment right here that won me this round

409
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,950
so right here he starts doing this duck

410
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:48,900
thing and I hit him with one punch right

411
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:50,370
there on the side of his head and he

412
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:52,290
must have been rattled a little bit like

413
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:54,330
he was guarding but it was strictly

414
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:56,130
defensive I want to win on the offense

415
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:57,840
and just through a flurry of punches and

416
00:14:56,130 --> 00:15:00,120
as I'm throwing these I'm like dude I

417
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:02,760
hope one of these knocks him out because

418
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:07,080
if this doesn't work I have no energy

419
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:09,060
left this face right here this is the

420
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,380
face of disappointment that you still

421
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:12,390
have a round and a half to

422
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:14,340
so I turn around I'm like oh yeah I'm

423
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:16,890
still fighting okay so we get in there

424
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:18,960
and then again just sloppy boxing from

425
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:21,510
both of us it's just exhaustion but he

426
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:23,340
doesn't make that final push that would

427
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:25,740
have run hit one hand around back so

428
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:27,450
it's the other on fire I look fast

429
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:31,050
forward to do this look I'm just leaning

430
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:33,540
on the ropes oh my god I can't emphasize

431
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:35,940
enough how dead I am I don't even need a

432
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:38,160
trained boxing this next for the rematch

433
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:40,080
duty if I just have more energy can you

434
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,090
imagine if I didn't get tired

435
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:44,640
the fights mine easy this dude's not

436
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:47,310
boxing he's like backyard brawling oh my

437
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:51,060
god I feel I feel bad for myself so it's

438
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:52,470
the final round at this point ksi didn't

439
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,220
finish me like he said he was gonna do

440
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:54,720
in the fourth round

441
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:56,280
I didn't finish him like I said I was

442
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,470
gonna be doing the third round we both

443
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,480
realized that we're being warriors and

444
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:01,830
this is gonna be a dogfight

445
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:04,560
unfortunately for me at this point the

446
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:06,090
fight I was a bag of wet noodles that's

447
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,860
that's the best way to describe me look

448
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:10,410
it okay I pushed me at one point and the

449
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:12,300
ref turns his back I literally take a

450
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:15,660
break and I just sit on the ropes like

451
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:17,520
that him be a maverick like who tells

452
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:19,530
you you're not allowed to do that during

453
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:21,510
the middle of a boxing match I'm a rule

454
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:23,010
breaker baby read the merge read the

455
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:24,000
frickin merge dude by the way if you

456
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:25,290
haven't copped it yet you know where to

457
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,810
do so link in description

458
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:30,480
or look appalled calm slash shop so put

459
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:33,120
quite simply this six round mentally I

460
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,650
was sent back into the third grade this

461
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,570
is where I was not quicker than him I

462
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:38,190
wasn't anything better than him so he

463
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:39,960
was able to land these big punches and

464
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:41,640
again if he didn't knock me out I'm just

465
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:44,460
the type of dude like I could take these

466
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:45,810
hits so unless I go unconscious like you

467
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:50,970
know I'm still gonna keep coming forward

468
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:53,070
oh my god this is so this is just a dog

469
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:54,570
fight got to give it to a man gotta give

470
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:57,870
it to him don't like the kid but got to

471
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:59,550
give it to him so there's about 15

472
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:01,980
seconds left when I say I'm on the verge

473
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:04,910
of death it's not a joke literally he's

474
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:08,190
just bang bang head shot body shot I am

475
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:12,000
about to collapse I'm like when is this

476
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:14,820
bell ring bell rings this might be the

477
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,440
greatest moment of my life like I was so

478
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:18,000
really the first thing I do is go over

479
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:20,430
to the ropes and lean over just sheer

480
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,230
relief and they picked him up right away

481
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:23,750
I'm like what I'm like bro you

482
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:26,060
definitely didn't win

483
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:27,530
to either one or it was a draw but I

484
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:29,740
knew I didn't lose and J told me the

485
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:32,120
same thing he's like yo you did not lose

486
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:34,810
but you might have had a draw and sure

487
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:37,880
enough dude raises both of our hands

488
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:39,980
just confusion no idea what's going on

489
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,540
no idea what a majority draw means or

490
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:42,800
how that conclusion was reached cuz

491
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:44,600
again I'm not a boxer I didn't study

492
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,590
boxing everyone is just confused my

493
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,350
coach goes that's good it means you

494
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:50,120
didn't lose and in my mind I'm like okay

495
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:51,680
but I also didn't win and then the first

496
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:54,410
thought was like damn the rematch is

497
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:55,970
gonna be that much crazy you like that

498
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:58,070
would happen that would happen in my

499
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:59,960
life where it's just a tie but

500
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:03,440
nonetheless it was fun I obviously know

501
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:05,900
going into it next time that if I don't

502
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,220
get tired there's no chance of me losing

503
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:09,410
I don't even want to sit here and like

504
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:10,580
say how bad I'm gonna be KS higher like

505
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:11,930
