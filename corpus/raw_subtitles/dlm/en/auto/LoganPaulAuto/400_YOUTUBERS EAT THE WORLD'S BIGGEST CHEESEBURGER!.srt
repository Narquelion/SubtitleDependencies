outside but there's one crucial crucial

23
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:54,640
thing that I missed for hosting a Super

24
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:55,330
Bowl party I really messed up I dropped

25
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,040

32
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:29,260
that's the point that's exactly so we

33
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,670
