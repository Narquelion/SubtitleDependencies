102
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:29,780
we're sitting in the back of this uber

103
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:31,460
here talking about how basic jack is so

104
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:32,990
just like a ride right off the bat first

105
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:35,060
glance let's start with the green teas

106
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:35,750
from Starbucks like that's numero uno

107
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,280
basic Oh

108
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:40,250
number two look at these sunglasses like

109
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,349
that's that's oh come on you had me yeah

110
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,820
cuz I'm a guy and I love red man and

111
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:45,530
then I think just the thing that takes

112
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,729
the cake for me is the hoop earrings

113
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:48,979

114
00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:53,479
