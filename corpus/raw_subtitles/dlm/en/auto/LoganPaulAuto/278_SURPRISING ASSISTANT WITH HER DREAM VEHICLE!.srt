p.m. my assistant Danny loosely hints

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,240
that today is her two-year anniversary

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:23,070
working for team members now am I an

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,539
[ __ ] he doesn't forgot yeah maybe but

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,789
obviously my mind starts racing cuz I

9
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:28,080
had nothing planned absolutely nothing

10
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:29,640
so I started thinking back and I

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,179
realized that I've known Danny for like

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,650
four years

13
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:33,059
basically heard a few other people

14
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,469
randomly linked up with my dad when I

15
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:35,940
asked him to drive my school bus from

16
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:37,590
New York to California she has been a

17
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,910
badass since day one she's literally one

18
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,040
of the best people I've ever had the

19
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,629
pleasure of working with somehow she has

20
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:50,010
not quit after two years of this

21
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:52,350
[ __ ] so today I'm gonna get Danny

22
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,120
her dream vehicle the only problem is I

23
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,010
have no idea what that is

24
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,600
have you talked to Danny do you know

25
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:02,160
what her dream car is a newer version

26
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,489
yeah it hardly stars but it works which

27
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,140
means a better one a new one yeah yeah I

28
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:10,080
think it might be but we better find out

29
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,760
yes I'm gonna ask her brother so then I

30
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,560
did that and then I called her mom and

31
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,930
they both confirmed that Danny indeed

32
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,409
wants a 2020 Jeep Grand Cherokee okay

33
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,880
great

34
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:19,320
so I called my financial manager to see

35
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:26,210
if we could even do it your investment

36
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:30,869
portfolio because of coronavirus are you

37
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:32,310
I mean the ideally we find a sponsor so

38
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:34,740
that brings me here guys today this

39
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:37,020
video is brought to you by no except me

40
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,280
myself maverick clothing we couldn't

41
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,200
find the sponsor in time but also I

42
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,970
don't know I preferred promoting my own

43
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,140
it's not even just mine anymore it's not

44
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,729
maverick by Logan Paul anymore it's

45
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,200
maverick clothing calm and we spent the

46
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:48,149
past year rebranding coming up a new

47
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,170
creative ideas designs etc they're

48
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,280
simple they're sleek they're cool

49
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,329
they're low-key still keeping the

50
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,009
meaning of the brand which obviously

51
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:55,320
means the world to me hopefully you guys

52
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:56,850
do the idea of using and embracing your

53
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,350
differences to fuel your ship it's a

54
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,180
very simple concept I think being the

55
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:01,290
kid that was laughed at being the kid

56
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,640
that was undermined that no one thought

57
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:04,170
was gonna do the thing who did the

58
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,790
[ __ ] thing it just resonates with me

59
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:07,469
so excited to launch this the bad news

60
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:09,209
unfortunately he can't get any of it yet

61
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:10,030
it's not available yet if full launch is

62
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:12,280
coming mate

63
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:13,420
the second so mark the day I [ __ ] up a

64
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,560
lot in my life I've made a lot of

65
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,210
mistakes I've also had a lot of

66
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,110
successes and when I was at bat low

67
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:18,850
point in my life you know I never

68
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:20,680
thought I'd make it out but I am living

69
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:22,150
proof that it can happen and the launch

70
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,530
is gonna set her around the idea that

71
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,390
you can and even even though you feel

72
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:26,620
like you've gotten beat down by life it

73
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:28,780
starts right here started there for me

74
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:31,660

77
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,800

Danny literally like does everything for

79
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,490
me if I need something usually she gets

80
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:41,020
it done so today to distract her from

81
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:42,370
what's actually happening via text I

82
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,870
