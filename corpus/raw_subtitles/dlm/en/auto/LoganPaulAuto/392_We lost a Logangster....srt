81
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:06,109

00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:12,109
time you could stop even when you're

86
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:13,699
holding a camera is the pop zooms are

87
00:04:12,109 --> 00:04:14,660
good for vlogs genuinely but like I

88
00:04:13,699 --> 00:04:17,030
think you're doing a little too much

89
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:18,620
typically on a pop zoom it's cause like

90
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:20,000
you're overcompensating for something or

91
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,440
something's not funny or just like spice

92
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,460
it up say a joke is not funny check this

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,620

00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:05,750
for the day for me and it's it's this is

136
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:08,130

147
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:36,270

recently passed away

156
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,190
Nick vanderlin from the Netherlands lost

157
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:59,280
his battle earlier this month

158
00:07:55,190 --> 00:08:02,940
normally I would keep this private I'm

159
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:06,750
sure his family is grieving plenty but

160
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:08,280
this next sentence kind of I felt like

161
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:10,350
Nick would want this we've been told

162
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,150
that in his final weeks he talked about

163
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:14,010
Logan a lot and how big the impact of

164
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:16,050
his wish was on Nick stayed up every

165
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:17,370
night waiting for the new video Nick

166
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:18,810
would have wanted us to let Logan know

167
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:21,039
of his passing and how much does it wish

168
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:23,389
experience might

169
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,860
