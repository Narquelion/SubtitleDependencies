00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:57,200

27
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,910
here I'm gonna be shutting my phone off

28
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,860
literally my only source of

29
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:02,210
communication is gonna be these vlogs

30
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,770
and it's not even a conference is

31
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:05,930
there's no communication it's just me

32
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:08,510
posting vlogs like no one's gonna be

33
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:10,490
able to reach me running bro what's up

34
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:12,860
this is convened rocks this could mean

35
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:15,890
drugs I'm gonna be saying that's so

36
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:18,340
often because everything here could mean

37
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:18,340
drugs

38
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:31,940
the best here is like dangerously crazy

39
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:33,440
the problem is it gets literally

40
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:36,230
everywhere like it's probably gonna seep

41
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:40,280
into this camera yeah no unfortunately

42
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:42,380
your camera we take all the crevices

43
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,740
show like the lens the audio jack the

44
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:47,209
LCD screen on the back basically we're

45
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:48,920
professionals last year we had a little

46
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:50,450
issue with recording the entrance to

47
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:55,580
have to scout your car to see if you're

48
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:59,120
smuggling anyone in the only weapons I

49
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:02,780
got of these guns haha the only animal I

50
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,140
got is these guns check in the back

51
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,220
right now

52
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:11,630
I really hope we don't have any weapons

53
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:12,650
or anything literally like what like so

54
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:14,209
security here at Burning Man is

55
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,950
obviously like a little subpar we easily

56
00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:17,270
could have snuck Evan here but I think

57
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:20,270
it's just cuz everyone's here to have

58
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:27,080
fun like we just chilling rock bottom

59
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:28,850
