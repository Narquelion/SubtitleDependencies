2
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:14,370
14 years old

3
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:16,020
freshman year basically consistent of

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:18,060
getting beaten up popping pimples

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,890
getting beaten up trying to fit in

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,960
begging not to get beat up and getting

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,630
beaten up more let's just say this was

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,810
not my year I could compare it to a 2018

9
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:29,670
Logan Paul anyways I had not hit puberty

10
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,590
yet I was the shortest one out of all my

11
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,719
friends my voice was still high and my

12
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,640
dick was still small fabulous but still

13
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,920
I remember freshmen Logan was so

14
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:41,850
intrigued by some of the senior girls

15
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:44,489
they were so hot how did they have so

16
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,870
many curves and womanly features it

17
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:48,570
didn't make any sense

18
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:50,399
well the hottest one her name was Sarah

19
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,399
Campbell let's call her she happened to

20
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:56,340
be in my study hall this girl was a dime

21
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:59,969
when she walked by us it was fireworks

22
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,859
baby the booty the boobies the beauty

23
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:03,840
sitting behind her for half the year was

24
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:04,229
one of the greatest experiences of my

25
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,850
life

26
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:08,189
one day after getting beaten up I

27
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,140
decided I was done looking at the back

28
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:12,659
of Sarah Campbell's head for 45 minutes

29
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,939
every day I was gonna march right up to

30
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:15,869
her and make her my wife while I still

31
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:19,439
had the chance

32
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:30,479
so I give my battle call Hannah and I

33
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:33,180
say okay look I literally don't know

34
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,939
what's yours I take your bread meanwhile

35
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:38,040
I'm sweating bullets I'm a rock hard for

36
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:42,479
some reason and I feel like my lungs are

37
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:44,640
about to explode oh thanks but are you

38
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:50,430
okay she must have noticed that I wasn't

39
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:52,020
breathing on the floor well my tactics

40
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,670
work and she must have thought me being

41
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,350
unconscious was cute because from that

42
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,600
day on sometimes Sarah would initiate

43
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:58,010
conversations with me and I even helped

44
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,840
her

45
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:01,700
homework once but I knew that our

46
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,800
relationship had to go to that next

47
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,570
level and to do that I needed her phone

48
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,130
number so I asked my freshman friends

49
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:09,260
for advice and lucky for me my one

50
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:11,180
friend Jamie was actually family friends

51
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:12,740
with Sara and he had her number so I

52
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:14,980
took it from him because I did not feel

53
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:16,640
like passing out again in front of Sara

54
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:18,890
not my brand

55
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,930
that night moment of truth phones out

56
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:23,150
fingers ready to texts ears so [ __ ]

57
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:31,070

58
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:39,410

00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:44,000

60
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:45,680

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,600

62
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,920

63
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,360

64
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,130

68
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:59,900
lived in and what her favorite movie was

69
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:01,970
all of us were losing our minds finally

70
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,800
one day Sara and I were texting and she

71
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:06,260

and then

96
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,020
incoming picture message from Sarah

97
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:18,090
Campbell my hands are shaking

98
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:21,359
I opened the message and oh my gosh what

99
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:23,250
the [ __ ] was I looking at that first is

100
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:24,960
looking to chuck or maybe a Pokemon

101
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,510
potentially that Pokemon that looks like

102
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,880
a duck side but no after further

103
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:32,010
inspection I realize I'm looking at an

104
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:35,940
extreme close-up of a man's face and

105
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:38,910
then it hits me that man is Jamie my

106
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:41,010
friend Jamie the one who gave me Sarah's

107
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:43,500
number in the first place except now

108
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:45,840
it's very clear to me it wasn't Sarah's

109
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:48,450
number I had been flirting with my

110
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,270
friend Jamie over text for the past two

111
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:53,730
weeks and sure I'm embarrassed but what

112
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:56,160

113
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:58,860

121
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:13,950
