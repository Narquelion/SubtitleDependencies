burning me on one road to get to Reno

11
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:30,570
and that road is closed because there's

00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,160
a huge fire if you are attending Burning

13
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,140

14
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,420
your trip because the main highway that

15
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,690
