black horse it was

one hey jokes aside i'm actually really

20
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,160
happy with how this turned out it took

21
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,440
about three days to paint there's a lot

22
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,640
of really pretty colors in there none of

23
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,000
which i can see of course i'm actually

24
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,199
kind of embarrassed to say this but i

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,400
bought this horse lamp for about eight

26
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,920
thousand dollars but now that it's in

27
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,400
our piece i could probably give

28
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,520
one one to two million dollars i bet i

29
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,560
