I mean I got stuff to do I have to

114
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:23,419
address the problems that actually hi oh

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,100
hello Wow but this is actually perfect

116
00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:39,440
because okay so just follow me into the

117
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:40,789
kitchen so the problem has to do with

118
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,310
these two things right here

119
00:05:40,789 --> 00:05:44,690
comm and plates hi buddy as you guys

120
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:46,370
know when it comes to plates

121
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:47,509
I like plates car-lengths plates look

122
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:49,520
we've all look everyone in the house

123
00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:50,990
loves plates look see what's Kong has

124
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,440
made a distance I will take a plate and

125
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:56,330
I'll throw it now great look look look

126
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,949
he's still over there now I'll grab

127
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:59,900
another plate I'll look I'll make eye

128
00:05:57,949 --> 00:06:03,500
contact look he's still over there okay

129
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:06,590
and I'll throw the place he's still over

130
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:08,810
there granted he may have got a little

131
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:11,479
closer but the point is my boy is safe

132
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:14,419
okay so I guess the best way to describe

133
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:16,310
this um we got an email on the store

134
00:06:14,419 --> 00:06:18,050
website local Paul cops last shot and it

135
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:20,270
was a combination of like yelling at me

136
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:22,159
but also like really funny and creative

137
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:23,960
and witty and I resonated with it I was

138
00:06:22,159 --> 00:06:25,789
like whoa this is like kind of funny but

139
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,729
at the same time they're yelling at me

140
00:06:25,789 --> 00:06:30,560
because I I throw plates around calm I

141
00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:32,539
completely understand it I get how it

142
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,729
would appear as if I'm putting my dog in

143
00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:36,260
danger trust me guys I'm not we make it

144
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:37,940
a point that Kong is a safe distance

145
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:39,949
away whenever I pick up a plate the

146
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,630
house rule is Lydia goes and grabs Kong

147
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:44,120
just because obviously I'm not like I

148
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:46,699
don't want to hurt my dog with my stupid

149
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,740
antics however this person is not

150
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:51,650
they're not aware of that so I decided

151
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:55,009
to make a cartoon out of the email they

152
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:57,020
send okay so I've been waiting for this

153
00:06:55,009 --> 00:06:59,690
vlog my dad was actually the one who

154
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:00,979
noticed this email comeback I need you

155
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:02,210

158
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:08,599
this funny email and it was just like

159
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:10,940
the most diabolical evil yet funny email

160
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:12,530

161
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:14,030

where's got to be something I can do

163
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:17,810
with after about a solid 30 seconds of

164
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,340
thinking I was like Gregg yo we need to

165
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:21,169
make that into a cartoon when I was a

166
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:24,110

hopefully save call losing and I are

177
00:07:44,449 --> 00:07:48,349

00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:56,030
until Kong is standing in the wrong

183
00:07:54,110 --> 00:08:01,280
place at the wrong time and that is I

184
00:07:56,030 --> 00:08:02,599
pierced by surrounded oh I've lost count

185
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,250
of the amount of vlogs in which I've

186
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:05,810
seen Kong standing dangerously close to

187
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:07,159
the area of impact whatever you guys

188
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:08,900
decide to turn the play into a

189
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:12,259
projectile by hurling it aimlessly it's

190
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:13,849
a grounder wall ah ha wait pause yo at

191
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:19,129
this point I'm reading this email I'm

192
00:08:13,849 --> 00:08:20,539
like with them another like two and a

193
00:08:19,129 --> 00:08:23,270
half minutes I'm just incredible in this

going to feel when young dog Oh starts

197
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:31,699
yelping and excruciating amounts of pain

198
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,680
rambling around on your kitchen floor

199
00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:35,659
his little paws slipping in the blood

200
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,339
seeping from his head trying to correct

201
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:39,320
his clumsy attempts at staying upright

202
00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:42,289
all while trying to make sense of what

203
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:44,180
the hell just happened I'll tell you

204
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:46,010
right now how you're going to feel in

205
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:47,570
those mere seconds after you discover

206
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:48,920
what you've done to poor puppy you'll

207
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,149
question how you could have been so

208
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,010
stupid

209
00:08:50,149 --> 00:08:53,959
by putting innocent family members in

210
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:56,060
harm's way offer a little more content a

211
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:57,890
few extra views and a bit more attention

212
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:59,720
you'll wish nothing more than being able

213
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:01,610
to wind the clock back 10 seconds and

214
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,260
choose not to smash that ceramic canine

215
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:04,670
cannon on the floor which may result in

216
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,920
forever saying goodbye to that little

217
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:10,250
fluffy good boy both you I and all of

218
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:13,339
the low gang loved so as if it's not

219
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:16,279
already just like weird and way too far

220
00:09:13,339 --> 00:09:20,240
this guy's freaking goes darker bro like

221
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:21,860
really dark go after those mere seconds

222
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,480
of laughs the overwhelming gravity of

223
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,950
the situation will begin to sink in

224
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,630
waves of gut-wrenching

225
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:28,370
we'll rush through your body you will

226
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:29,870
find it physically impossible to aid

227
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:32,090
Kong in the moment so fingers crossed

228
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:34,310
Lydia will be there to rush him out the

229
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:36,020
door to the nearest vet hospital Brendan

230
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:37,670
will be lost for words as he frantically

231
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:40,090
delete the footage before turning the

232
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:42,110
camera off and sitting down in silence

233
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:43,760
you'll find yourself in the most

234
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:45,470
deplorable distressing in self

235
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,750
disdaining situation one could ever

236
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:50,150
create for themselves the absolute

237
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:52,220
destruction you just cost it will all of

238
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:53,840
a sudden seem so stupid and completely

239
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:56,690
avoidable as your mind starts to process

240
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:58,100
all of the agonizing consequences no

241
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:59,600
more than a minute would have passed but

242
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,760
you've somehow just inflicted a

243
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,070
lifetime's worth of suffering and regret

244
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,750
upon yourself glancing down at the floor

245
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:07,310
you see nothing but shattered ceramic

246
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:10,970
maverick remains covered in the blood of

247
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:13,070
the Savage your savage our savage

248
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:14,660
looking up your cylindrical rope feature

249
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:16,220
you'll contemplate cutting a piece off

250
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:17,570
and ending things quickly over the

251
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:19,190
balcony rather than dealing with the

252
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:20,840
ramifications this event will have on

253
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:22,340
your personal and professional life at

254
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,380
what point will your ego stop

255
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:25,940
blindsiding your common sense and duty

256
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:28,460
of care for the general well-being and

257
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:30,320
safety of others Logan I hope these

258
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:32,480

259
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,520
