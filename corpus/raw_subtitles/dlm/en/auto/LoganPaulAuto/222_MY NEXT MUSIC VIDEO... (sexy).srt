66
00:02:52,500 --> 00:03:02,370
weirdest dad ever me yeah hey kids

67
00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:06,060
you're smashing in there yeah

68
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:13,530
the city is lighting up you got Wi-Fi

69
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:14,910
Lydia Wi-Fi so no handlebars it's about

70
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:17,489
bikes right and there's a lot of hot

71
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:21,690
females I had this idea where I would

72
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:22,950
ride them but like but like a bicycle

73
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:24,600
not in the sexual way so we're gonna

74
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:26,220
make this thing as formation out of

75
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,080
people it's called the human but we're

76
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:30,540
gonna put the girls and me on this

77
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,989
platform and then roll down this issue

78
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:35,730
is it looks kind of ridiculous like this

79
00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:39,630
so yeah except it's gonna be four girls

80
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:41,250

81
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:43,920

82
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:47,370
