but it's actually deep and we're going

295
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,760
we're going in it's the deeper story

296
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,200
um that happened at the beginning of the

297
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,000
year the behind the scenes the stuff

298
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,160
that

299
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,079
um people didn't know about stuff that

300
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,120
was going on internally with me and my

301
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,360
team and where i was

302
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,040
in my headspace and how such a

303
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,040
catastrophe happened and

304
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,120
the past six months and then trying to

305
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,720
become a better person you know become

306
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,880
more empathetic and more compassionate

307
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,519
and use the boxing match against ksi as

308
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,120
a way for

309
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,680
for me to keep my head up essentially

310
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,360
and and and literally i guess continue

311
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,079
fighting but yeah well we just got deep

312
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,600
bro next question dude

313
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,200
here's one that kind of ties into the

314
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,959
last uh question that you just answered

315
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,480
how do you deal with hate

316
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:18,160
yeah yeah a lot a lot of hatred this

317
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,160
past year and most of it is

318
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,240
is warranted but guys when it comes to

319
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,000
hate 99 of the time when someone is

320
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,640
exuding negative energy that usually

321
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,320
comes out

322
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,320
in the form of hate or mean comments

323
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,399
whatever it is it's a reflection

324
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,240
of how they feel about themselves where

325
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,600
they're at in their own life so like

326
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,120
don't don't take it personal

327
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,839
if you because like picture this you're

328
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,399
so angry and not content with your own

329
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,640
life

330
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,519
you have to protrude that onto other

331
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,360
people

332
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,720

the approval of other people to do what

338
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,410
you want to do in life
