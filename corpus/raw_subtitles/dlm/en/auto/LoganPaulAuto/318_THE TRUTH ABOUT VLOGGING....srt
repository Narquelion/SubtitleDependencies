15
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,119
from four to six minutes

16
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,650
but anyways hey what's up little game

17
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:15,540

00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,950
actually wanna like take a second to

21
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:21,270
talk about blood if you're not part of

22
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,560
the Logan make sure to subscribe smash

23
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:24,450
the button in the face to me cuz as you

24
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,220
can see we are the strongest most lit

25
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,869
and probably weirdest family on YouTube

26
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,299
we do have a flaws though we have some

27
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:31,530
flaws such as whatever happened here I

28
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:33,329
don't understand what happened bro when

29
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:39,619
I was building the ramp it all made so

30
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:39,619
much sense in my mind it's all science

31
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,450
you guys know I just got back from

32
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:51,550
Coachella yeah boy yeah boy definitely

33
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:53,530
chill at his ass off but basic level was

34
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:55,420
very high I fun fact I haven't showered

35
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,860
or even shaved since then once again

36
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,030
I'll say yeah we're working on it and

37
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,560
you guys can probably hear my nasal

38
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:00,100
passages are a little congested I've

39
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:14,920
been sick

40
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:37,000
which reminds me by the way quick put

41
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:38,560
all the energy on a real note we gotta

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,959
figure out what we're gonna do about

43
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,970
this soil in the pool because because

44
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,959
soil doesn't necessarily mix with water

45
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,680
I don't think this is gonna just

46
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:47,290
disappear

47
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,430
Adam I'm a real adult level it's

48
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:53,620

121
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:19,110
family you inspire me the reason I make

122
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:21,090
content is literally for you guys so I

123
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:24,240
felt like this needed to be said ha

124
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:26,100
vlogging a daily vlogging I did not vlog

125
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,840
for the past two days because that was

126
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:30,450
at Coachella and in combination with me

127
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:32,400
being sick and having low energy like I

128
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:34,890
made a conscious decision to put every

129
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,210
ounce of energy I had into like dancing

130
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:38,040
and just having fun in like my real life

131
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:39,840
and you guys don't know this at

132
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,820
Coachella you're not a lot of film

133
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,440
professionally and even though it is

134
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:45,540
just a couple of us running around like

135
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,310
idiots with the camera technically it is

136
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,900
like professional and again you guys

137
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:50,580
don't know this but we had this issue

138
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:52,170
with Burning Man after the festival was

139
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:53,790
over we ran into some difficulties with

140
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:55,380
filming inside and whatnot even at your

141
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:57,000
70 National Park and we were there the

142
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:58,380
forest rangers they're like yo you you

143
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,400
cannot monetize any of these videos I

144
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,660
don't know if you guys noticed none of

145
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,950
them are monetized there were no ads in

146
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,270
the u.s. 70 videos over my birthday

147
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:04,560
weekend which was fine but when it

148
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:06,390
basically when it comes to filming in a

149
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,950
large environment like Coachella there

150
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:09,510
are so many things that I just didn't

151
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:10,980
feel like worrying about in combination

152
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:12,780
with being sick in combination with the

153
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,680
fact that it's a music festival so every

154
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,730
time there's music playing in the

155
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,380
background which was all the time

156
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:17,760
there's gonna be a copyright complaint

157
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,620
and then the video would just be either

158
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:23,160
taken down or not monetized just the

159
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:24,780
storm of us and I did not really feel

160
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,670
like dealing with but the reason I bring

161
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:28,470
this up is because I want to dive a

162
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:30,180
little deeper into the conversation

163
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:32,340
because it is it goes beyond just

164
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:34,020

to my full potential whether it's me

187
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:15,080
being sick whether it's me wanting to

188
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:17,120
allocate my time to branch out and do

226
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:31,010
universe for us when it comes to content

228
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:35,480

229
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:38,840
week in the Coachella this vlog as silly

230
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:41,090
as it is is so much bigger than me and

231
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:43,460
my team I had a fan come up to me at

232
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:45,500
Coachella you know who you are you dog I

233
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:46,850

234
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,560
saying it now I hope you're ok with it

235
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:50,810
the low gang is gonna know so he had

236
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,580
lost someone very close to him they were

237
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:54,980
like this and he told me he was broke

238
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:56,570
the only reason I got out of bed the

239
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:59,120
next morning was because I was looking

240
00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:01,010

241
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:04,490

inspired to make vlogs so I take that

246
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:16,930
and it just re-energizes me and is a

247
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:18,940
positive confirmation for me that I need

248
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:21,880
