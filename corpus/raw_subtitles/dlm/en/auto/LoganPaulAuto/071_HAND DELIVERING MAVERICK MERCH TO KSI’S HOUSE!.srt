41
00:01:24,539 --> 00:01:28,050
fight all right I'm like what what's

42
00:01:26,429 --> 00:01:29,130
going on how did this boy there's must

43
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:30,690
have been some sort of mix-up so I

44
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,909
watched this video Logan

45
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:37,500
Jake and you do this just me and the

46
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:41,490
mayor of the gym just practicing oh can

47
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,390
I do that bro I gave you that idea I

48
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,039
already did it

49
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:46,229
I can't believe you said that it's so

50
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:48,209
dumb I've gone cross-eyed so at this

51
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:51,899
point I'm just confused right so I keep

52
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:54,090
watching - OH - quick he's too quick

53
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:56,069
he's too powerful literally just look

54
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,289
how much that bag is swinging truly

55
00:01:56,069 --> 00:01:59,700
truly remarkable so I keep watching and

56
00:01:58,289 --> 00:02:01,619
they end up talking to Floyd Mayweather

57
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,179
senior when you think of boxing you

58
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:05,129
think of this guy he trained Floyd

59
00:02:03,179 --> 00:02:06,929
Mayweather Jr his whole life dude is an

60
00:02:05,129 --> 00:02:08,759
absolute legend and he's talking about

61
00:02:06,929 --> 00:02:18,840
how fast he is and someone from KS ice

62
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:20,819
team had the audacity to say this we

63
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,269
asked young JJ to show his speed and

64
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:23,269
throw it yeah

65
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:48,500
yeah big dumb dummy yeah so at this

66
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:49,940
point everyone's dog I'm like kind of

67
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,530
feeling bad for ginger like you gotta

68
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,250
train somewhere that was like yeah by

69
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:54,920
the way you suck

70
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:57,170
no it's sug we're not like ya know I

71
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,000
would not be had following their ergo

72
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:01,370
therefore what so it's like a transition

73
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,890
were like this like Leslie thusly

74
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:05,090
thusly he starts interviewing people

75
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:07,070
around the gym and he the first

76
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:09,520
interview does he interviews a Jeff aka

77
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:11,390
hot dog that dude is gonna win okay so I

78
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,190
know pause I know what you're thinking

79
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:14,870
why why did you call him hot dog guy cuz

80
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:16,340
when I went there he interviewed me and

81
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:20,350
he asked me a question that actually got

82
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:20,350
me thinking this act this blew my mind

83
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:37,220
no he asked me if a hot dog was a

84
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:39,560
sandwich help me please it's a hot dog

85
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:41,690
inside two pieces of bread like it's a

86
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:46,280
bun they're surrounding like a sandwich

87
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:48,500
bro it just doesn't know me Jeff yeah

88
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,260
we're boys we had hot dog discussion of

89
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:55,120
course he was on the spot so he answered

90
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:59,090
talk what did you kiss

91
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:01,010
Jeff's my boy Paul's tall he's got good

92
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:02,660
reach he forgot extremely handsome but

93
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:04,700
I'll let it slide and then he literally

94
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:08,989
in front of ksi goes what who are you

95
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:10,640
ksi what did you kiss again at this

96
00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:12,440
point I'm just feeling bad for JJ I'm

97
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,290
just like did you go to a gym to train

98
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:21,769
everyone's like like even people in the

99
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:23,000
US like here Lydia do you know okay I

100
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:26,300
like what you do with your hair by the

101
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,800
way Lydia she darkened it it's called an

102
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,600
ombre I think I don't know I'm not a

103
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,070
girl anyway okay so then ksi did not

104
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,510
learn his lesson from Jeff and he asks

105
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:34,900
the same question to Floyd Mayweather

106
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,900
senior

107
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:49,270
he avoids the question completely and

108
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:51,009
he's like I know one thing I can beat

109
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:53,530
that so then they're like trying to tell

110
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:55,150
him to like say ksi is gonna win right

111
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:56,349
and for whatever reason why did they

112
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:57,639
leave this part in the Edit you could

113
00:04:56,349 --> 00:05:01,479
have just like cut around it so the

114
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:03,039
prediction was right but I have no idea

115
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:04,569
honestly this is probably the same guy

116
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,919
that said ksi as fast with a Floyd

117
00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:06,879
Mayweather senior one of the greatest

118
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,710
boxers of all time

119
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:16,389
JJ you got to fire this guy bro he's a

120
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:21,580
Jewish is the most uncomfortable step

121
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:23,560
seen in my life oh honey no pop asking

122
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:27,639
people this dudes clearly uncomfortably

123
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:29,949
is like yeah ksi no one at this gym even

124
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:43,870
the guy training you thinks you can win

125
00:05:29,949 --> 00:05:45,250
this way yeah yeah uncle Jeff he's gonna

126
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:46,509
be working with Floyd Joyce we got to

127
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,949
make sure his hands are ready and then

128
00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:50,229
after that you got to get some rounds in

129
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:52,150
the body hey guess what JJ I sat in that

130
00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:53,800
same chair with uncle Joey and he also

131
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:55,029
wrapped my hands always that video not

132
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,680
enough proof literally I still have the

133
00:05:55,029 --> 00:06:02,680
wrap dispenser follow me coming in my

134
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:05,680
country training with my trainers that

135
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:12,339
says LP wraps they made me the same

136
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:13,300
exact dude I can do everything you can

137
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:16,120
do can do better

138
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:17,949
anything you can do I can do better it's

139
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,810
true though okay let us continue okay so

140
00:06:17,949 --> 00:06:25,419
at this point it's pretty clear JJ's

141
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:27,009
been taking hella elves and uh I planned

142
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:29,050
for this I knew this would happen so a

143
00:06:27,009 --> 00:06:31,120
few days ago my friend Mac was here he

144
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:32,289
actually lives in London sort of near JJ

145
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,339
and I was like you know I'm sure there's

146
00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:34,750
gonna be a day with Jay Z is like

147
00:06:33,339 --> 00:06:36,250
feeling down order which was probably

148
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,659
when he got clown at the mayweather camp

149
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,979
so I'm coming in like you're walking out

150
00:06:37,659 --> 00:06:40,539
well how can I help how can a chair mom

151
00:06:38,979 --> 00:06:42,190
and if there's one thing I guarantee

152
00:06:40,539 --> 00:06:43,779
nobody's doing one thing that just makes

153
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:46,440
people feel savage like a boss like

154
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:46,440
winner is

155
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:51,880
that maverick merch right so I figured

156
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:57,880
I'd hand-deliver through Mack JJ a

157
00:06:51,880 --> 00:07:00,550
package of merch it's about to go down

158
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,960
ksi is about to be KS mine okay guys

159
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:06,190
come here this is my English friend his

160
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:10,570
name is Matt inside the maverick store

161
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:12,370
and Mac okay so I also know JJ lives in

162
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:14,080
London I had this idea right the kids

163
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:16,270
not quite a maverick yet he probably

164
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,490
never will be but there is hope so I

165
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:20,620
thought I would give JJ a gift in the

166
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:22,030
