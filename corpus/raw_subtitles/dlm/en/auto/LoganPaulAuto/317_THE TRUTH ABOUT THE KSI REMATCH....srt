1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,799
can i get some logan

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,320
ksi v logan paul tickets no it doesn't

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,160
look like it's gonna [ __ ] happen

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,840
because logan's too [ __ ] [ __ ]

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,599
logan's too [ __ ] [ __ ] can't be

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,960
talking about me right

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,960
not me i'm not a [ __ ]

8
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,280
what's good i'm just saying and mind you

9
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,040
this dude he's good at manipulation

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,880
that's his tactic the first three videos

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,600
he actually made of this year were about

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,680
me

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,600
and the fight just an ample amount of

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,200
words coming from his mouth and i've yet

15
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,239
to weigh in on what's happening with the

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,760
rematch and i want to

17
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,520
finally say something because i saw this

18
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,000
video today and i found it uh comedic

19
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,680
logan's too [ __ ] [ __ ] me [ __ ] was

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,960
[ __ ] good

21
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,680
so listen i felt about a month ago jj's

22
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,920
team

23
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,760
seemed sort of uninterested in pursuing

24
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,680
the conversation around the fight and

25
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,160
actually making progress to make it

26
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,559
happen

27
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,640
i was unsure if he was gonna still do it

28
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,159
because guys i'm still training and by

29
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,760
the way i'm not training for no reason

30
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,760
not to stay in shape i'm training so i

31
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,760
can beat ksi's ass so this doesn't

32
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,080
happen again

33
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,960
in fact the other day we had our gym

34
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,000
rearranged

35
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,479
to train more efficiently oh no oh my

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,119
god

37
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:27,840
oh my god this is incredible shut the

38
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,840
[ __ ] up

39
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,000
so i'm taking this very seriously i want

40
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,799
to make this happen not only for

41
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,240
for me as like a sort of finish what i

42
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,600
started type thing but for the fans

43
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,200
obviously like you guys want to see the

44
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,720
rematch so i'm training and then i go

45
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,159
online and i see um

46
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:49,600
ksi's is is making videos where wow wow

47
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,600
you my friend are looking a bit sick

48
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,360
what what what happened what i mean are

49
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,040
you even trying and so i'm wondering if

50
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,399
he's like losing motivation if he

51
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,920
doesn't want to do it like

52
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,920
here's what i will say i am fighting

53
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,640
someone this year and we will have a

54
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,719
venue

55
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,759

this month in february and after the

83
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,599
last fight when we proposed to

84
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,040

00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,080
ksi refused he did not want to do that

87
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,760
and he backed out

88
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,120

90
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,800

you're good bro not to mention it is

94

unsanctioned boxing match approved

96
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,000

97
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:33,840
like england is

98
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,840
