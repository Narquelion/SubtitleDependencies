66
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:23,110
going to forget those stupid honestly

67
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,690

68
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:26,310
okay so it's called the g-wagen

69
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:27,960
like the idea of just taking out the

70
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:30,900
space as I said and just calling it the

71
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:32,610
wagon wagon class but it needs more like

72
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,980
looking this thing it's a big literally

73
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:36,480
towering over vehicles I'm looking down

00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,730
on this thing I can't even see like this

75
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,560
thing's a piece of frickin Beach I was

76
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:42,540
thinking like a Goliath big wagon or

77
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,890
like Godzilla the black baby Caesar the

78
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,630

00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,160
cherry that's like anyone else like out

80
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:48,870
of sleep on asleep and a thought to

decide what color I want to get a man so

82
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:55,920
