19
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:50,550
in a while hire a drill instructor to

up by drill sergeant no long there we go

65
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,760

have fun colors like blue Logan you're

102
00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:07,860
colorblind yeah I can see blue bro I'm

103
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:09,960
reading green color bud this is great

104
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,310
yeah I swear to God Lydia and I had this

105
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,660
problem like this just looks like a

106
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:14,069
darker color of this and then my

107
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,539
assistant Lydia informed me that they're

108
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:17,130
not the same color look the point is I'm

109
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:19,139
colored by I can see certain colors I

110
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:40,560
can see like certain shades of red I can

111
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:42,060
see yeah just working we hired him to do

112
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:46,800
a job he's doing the job

113
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:48,960
oh so things have been going interesting

114
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,430
today hiring a drill instructor was

115
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,860
definitely a bold move I'm slightly

116
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:56,120
concerned George Anthony is kind of

117
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:56,120
taking things to his own hands

118
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:07,560
but needless to say he's doing a great

119
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:09,180
job also my assistant Lydia just showed

120
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,980
up and she actually has been doing a

121
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:31,080
good job lately so I think we're just

122
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:32,550
gonna shower her with compliments kind

123
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:35,790
of a theme of the day right we're a blog

170
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:55,950
seconds or so as a moment to cherish our

171
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:58,550
