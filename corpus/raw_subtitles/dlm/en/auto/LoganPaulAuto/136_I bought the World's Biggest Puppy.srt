112
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:23,360
size of the ships can you imagine the

113
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:25,790

cuz they're gonna be brother and sister

118
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:33,650

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,660
breathe the Husky Mastiff off offspring

120
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,990

125
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:53,310
this dog is five months and you can tell

126
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,870
there's an extreme size difference okay

127
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:57,840
I'm rolling calm down calm down

128
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:59,400
I just don't want hurt like snapping you

129
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,900
don't saying because you know she snaps

130
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,980
and it's over I'm glad they're gonna get

131
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,210
to grow up together because otherwise

132
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:20,070
I'm not sure this would work

133
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:24,450
no play time here we go I think he's

134
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:26,610
done as some of you know I'm inserting

135
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:30,210
the the World Championship Russian slap

136
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:33,090
boxing competition my mom is not a fan

137
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:35,970
but we've been practicing right because

138
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:37,260
I'm used to punching and boxing and

139
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:39,060
obviously slapping is different like

140
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:42,150
these guys are wild they beat the SH

141
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:44,400
each other so we've been trying to

142
00:07:42,150 --> 00:08:05,630
master how hard I hit figure out which

143
00:07:44,400 --> 00:08:07,860
way is the most effective to my hand

144
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:09,450
it's the morning after we got the

145
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,220
Tibetan Mastiff and I try to bring her

146
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:13,020
back in the backyard and she just she's

147
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:18,690

148
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:22,830
really scared you see her she's

149
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:24,290

156
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:41,720
separation anxiety from her family if I

157
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:44,000

184
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:12,470
studio and got like caught in a corridor

185
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:14,210
some [ __ ] was connected to a piano and

186
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:15,680
dragged the piano through the yard this

187
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:18,320
is the type of problems you haven't you

188
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,440
get big dollars it's perfect you

189
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,850

190
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,830
responsibility I can't wait to see what

191
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:27,920

man - see here I'm gonna try thing she

194
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:34,240
ways especially 70 80 pounds 32 pounds

195
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:40,570
so she's not even halfway done growing

196
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:48,620
up with a name for her her name is

197
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:51,320
ginger the giant because she's a ginger

198
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:53,240
dog and she's a giant that looks just

199
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:57,610
like Broly like she's just a giant dildo

200
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:57,610
dog she's just super floppy

201
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:02,510
let's ginger ginger the giant what's

202
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:04,010
your fur so we wanted to make sure just

203
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:06,320
like with Broly that everything was okay

204
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:15,530
figure out why she's got extra toes or

205
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:18,440
something extra toes that is genetic

206
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:20,150
right so the only bad thing about it is

207
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,250
they don't hit the ground so don't wear

208
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:24,490
the claw down they can actually grow

209
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:38,089
