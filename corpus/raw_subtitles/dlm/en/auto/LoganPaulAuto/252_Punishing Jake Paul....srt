49
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,020
little stream behind me so we could have

50
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,190
a boat race we each had about an hour to

51
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,420
build their own little homemade boats

52
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,770
now the winner of the race gets a

53
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,390
hundred dollars but unfortunately the

54
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:47,310

55
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:48,660

56
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,920

57
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,330
obstacles and make it to the finish line

60
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:55,740
