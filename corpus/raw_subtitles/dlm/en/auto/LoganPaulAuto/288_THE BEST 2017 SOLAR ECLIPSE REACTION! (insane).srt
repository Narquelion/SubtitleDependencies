00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:37,380
clear the air is hot and I'm still a

9
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:39,239
challenge my team and I have flown 2,000

10
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,480
miles in an attempt to capture and

11
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:44,899
document the great American solar

12
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,899
eclipse

13
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:49,270
[Music]

14
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:57,360
my name is Logan Paul and welcome good

can't hold up I can explain no it's just

18
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,380
a thing we do in our vlogs it's not

19
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:18,090
they're not real punch this is fake yo

20
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:19,740
you could throw guys that's Kobe we're

21
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,259
staying out at his house in Nashville

22
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,820
Tennessee oh oh oh maybe actually hit

23
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:25,740
him on that last one I'm not sure I

24
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,300
think you made contact yeah anyways guys

25
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,530
Kobe dude thank you for letting him stay

26
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:32,250
here as you guys can see he's in the

27
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:33,210
Logan shop are you guys good that's my

28
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,610
boy

29
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:38,759
oh wow dude I like it when you do this

30
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:40,530
I'm so excited for today like I'm making

31
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,270
this for me like finally I feel like I

32
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:44,430
can make a piece of content for myself

33
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,780
to enjoy I'm a space geek bro and when I

34
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:50,429
found out there was a solar eclipse

35
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:51,630
happening this year I was like oh you

36
00:01:50,429 --> 00:01:54,119
know what I mean I haven't brought it's

37
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:58,470
a bit hot outside if it gets too hot can

38
00:01:54,119 --> 00:02:00,210
I use that Rolex to say I is mom boy the

39
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:02,580
boys are getting scientific Yul Brynner

40
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:04,650
what are you doing bro building our

41
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,299
filter cuz guys the Sun is so strong

42
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:08,009
that you need something to protect the

43
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:08,340
lens it would melt the inside of the

44
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:10,170
camera

45
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,549
that's scientifical actual factual guys

46
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,230
this is Josh by the way he's gonna be

47
00:02:11,549 --> 00:02:17,060
helping us hold up bro

48
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:21,209
is that Jake Palmer shine you know okay

49
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:23,310
the water broke localized oh yeah yeah

50
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:25,110
yeah okay we're gonna test this

51
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,549
concoction so it's crazy because in real

52
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:28,709
life this looks like a solid piece of

53
00:02:26,549 --> 00:02:30,360
foil when you pointed at the Sun it

54
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:31,590
doesn't look like a solid piece of foil

55
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,150
this is funny because we're gonna be

56
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:34,739
doing a bunch of scientific stuff today

57
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:36,690
we don't know what the hell we're

58
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:37,290
talking about yeah science [ __ ]

59
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:40,260
resonant

60
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:42,420
what do you see I think I see the Sun

61
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:44,250
where's this damn it cliff it's coming

62
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,989
bro we have like an hour of speaking of

63
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:48,000
that Colby bro we got to get going soon

64
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:49,860
we're gonna miss ya as usual guys we're

65
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,510
running late yes I refuse to mr. solar

66
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,250
eclipse I would rather my brother lose

67
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:54,239
all his subscribers actually kind of

68
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,040
happen the other day I'm just gonna

69
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,139
here's the deal low gang I must be some

70
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,669
facts it's actually factually the last

71
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:02,010
time a solar eclipse like this occurred

72
00:02:59,669 --> 00:03:03,000
was in 1979 it was pretty cool to see

73
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:06,270
here check

74
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,490
while the footage isn't that amazing the

75
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:11,640
last total eclipse of the Sun for North

76
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:14,580
America for the year 2017 well guess

77
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,870
what mr. newsman its 2017 also I'm not

78
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,370
sure if this is true but this is what

79
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,900
I've been saying solar eclipses like

80
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:20,550
this is only gonna happen once in our

81
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,550
lifetime what that means I don't know

82
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:24,900
maybe just like across America again I'm

83
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:27,240
not sure I think that is what it means

84
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,980
it is America so a solar eclipse like

85
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:31,020
this probably will happen elsewhere in

86
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,640
the world this one is the Great American

87
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:39,510
solar eclipse and it's only gonna happen

88
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:42,030
once in our lifetime u.s. totally we are

89
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:43,200
headed to a private Airport apparently

90
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:45,480
when the eclipse happens there's like a

91
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,250
360 degree sunset so this particular

92
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,660
Airport has like a lot of space we're

93
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,550
going to see all of it hopefully not

94
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:53,430
sure whose idea it was to run up in an

95
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:54,930
airport senator hasn't so much as we

96
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,880
love you Heather and you know you but

97
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:59,050
you sound

98
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:59,050
[Music]

99
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:11,820
all probably Hebrew set up dogs that are

100
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,800
$14,000 lamb shot whatever

101
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:15,420
Brendan made this morning don't I think

102
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:23,940
I'm gonna chase you solar eclipse and

103
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:27,420
I'm gonna get you engaged or slip and we

104
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:33,920
can show these doors I too easy to be

105
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:38,480
blasted amazing as Cochran oh my god yes

106
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:38,480
this is a little sketchy I love it

107
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,360
okay guys does the reason we chose the

108
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,960
rooftop obviously like I said so take a

109
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,960
look around guys

110
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:54,919
everywhere that we can you the Sun will

111
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:59,349
be setting it is curly up there I decide

112
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:59,349
I'm Margot Paul okay we can see anything

113
00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:08,419
that's my boy

114
00:05:03,289 --> 00:05:10,190
I got you of it yeah we are going to go

115
00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:12,229
back up there later that's the viewing

116
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:14,300
flooded part I will say yo it's really

117
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:16,159
hot and I heard when the moon covers the

118
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,569
Sun the temperatures drop a little bit

119
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:19,280
some wait for that because you are

120
00:05:17,569 --> 00:05:22,460
freaking burning that bro I'll be a

121
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,090
Jonas brother did it that's if you get

122
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:25,190
that reference

123
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:27,259
- thanks also most people don't know

124
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:29,050
that I majored in engineering in college

125
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:31,370
what does that have to do with space

126
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:32,810
nothing nothing but here's our solar

127
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:33,710
eclipse or Logan I'm a teacher of

128
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:36,530
science in a fun way

129
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:39,020
Evan call me come here okay so this is

130
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:41,090
what we do so let's pretend Evan is the

131
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:42,889
moon and Colby is the Sun normally if

132
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:44,210
the moon ever crosses the Sun it doesn't

133
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:46,069
matter because it doesn't completely

134
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:48,409
cover it so that rarely happens but

135
00:05:46,069 --> 00:05:49,879
today given our current location on

136
00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:51,919
planet Earth the moon is going to cover

137
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:54,949
the Sun in such a way that it completely

138
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:56,750
and fully blocks out the Sun so normally

139
00:05:54,949 --> 00:05:58,969
maybe the moon possibly sound like this

140
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:00,949
you think nothing of sometimes the moon

141
00:05:58,969 --> 00:06:02,810
crosses the Sun like this again still

142
00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:03,469
nothing where you saw we're like partial

143
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:09,680
solar eclipse

144
00:06:03,469 --> 00:06:11,599
but today the moon is going to did I get

145
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,880
ya Edgar do that where it completely

146
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:15,770
covers the Sun for a duration of two and

147
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,539
a half minutes during that time the

148
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,990
earth will get pitch black like it's

149
00:06:17,539 --> 00:06:19,460
nighttime

150
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:21,979
apparently you'll be able to see stars

151
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:23,389
and the planet Venus animals will start

152
00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:24,469
acting differently that's why I brought

153
00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:26,569
Kong I want to see what he does

154
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:28,099
apparently able to hear like crickets

155
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:29,810
chirping because you know they all think

156
00:06:28,099 --> 00:06:31,789
it's night time to quit idiots it's just

157
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:33,289
a neglect sigh to all the animals who

158
00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:35,150
wants to have logs just to remember just

159
00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:37,009
gives you merch link in description logo

160
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:38,810
balkon / shot one thing i forgot to

161
00:06:37,009 --> 00:06:39,979
mention is during the Eclipse we yeah we

162
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:42,259
get to wear these really cool-looking

163
00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:44,599
Eclipse glasses mmm these are these are

164
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:46,849
super cool look at eyes this feel like

165
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:48,199
I'm at the premiere for Spy Kids 3d it's

166
00:06:46,849 --> 00:06:49,789
crazy guys because I can't see anything

167
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:51,680
it's absolutely pitch black the only

168
00:06:49,789 --> 00:06:54,080
thing I could see is the Sun Oh Evan oh

169
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,720
that is oh I know what Evan we're not

170
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,700
yet

171
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,190
sure look Brendon can you see through

172
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:00,510
them nope I told you pitchblack that way

173
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:02,160
we don't burn our eyes when we look at

174
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:03,780
the Sun that would be bad

175
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,970
hey guys so life wouldn't be life

176
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:08,130
without problems one we are experiencing

177
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:09,930
right now this lens is like breaking of

178
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:11,640
the Brendon what's happening bro it just

179
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,970
says it won't communicate with this

180
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:16,800
camera no oh

181
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:18,420
$14,000 lady we tried that camera we

182
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,950
tried Brendan's camera that lens was

183
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:21,750

fact right now you can see that the moon

249
00:09:50,999 --> 00:09:54,479
is covering maybe more than like

250
00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:56,159
three-quarters of the Sun when the moon

251
00:09:54,479 --> 00:09:57,509
completely covers the Sun a couple

252
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:59,159
things are going to have one there's

253
00:09:57,509 --> 00:10:00,809

I'm not a scientist Brahma blocker but I

heard there's going to be a ringer on

256
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:05,309
the Sun and if you have a lens that can

257
00:10:03,599 --> 00:10:07,319
get close enough to see the moon you can

258
00:10:05,309 --> 00:10:08,459
see the sun shining through the ridges

259
00:10:07,319 --> 00:10:10,649
of the moon there's going to be like a

260
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:12,029
big flash when it like finally happened

261
00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:14,629
