104
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:09,419
get this dog it was pretty cool oh you

105
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:13,500

106
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:16,069
more of a brain it's very very slightly

107
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:20,939

tanks for a snake

115
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,770

116
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:43,409
care of a snake it's not too difficult

117
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:45,300
betting changes feeding you could do

118
00:06:43,409 --> 00:06:48,960
that easy yeah this just in from the

119
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:51,090
legal team snakes will have to be caught

120
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,610
and will not be purchased and must be

121
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:55,949
caught out of scenes 42 through 46 in an

122
00:06:53,610 --> 00:07:11,550
effort to make continued content that is

123
00:06:55,949 --> 00:07:14,819
suitable for all you said where you

124
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:16,349

Friday

132
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:36,300

133
00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:38,909
showing the sculptures that Lydia's been

134
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:40,860
making out of clay all day but

135
00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:42,060

136
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,680

140
00:07:47,219 --> 00:07:55,460
