00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,740
we're gonna let you know how we feel

184
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,569
about it and we're going to be

185
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:30,169
completely honest as soon as we do it so

186
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:34,330
your room oh I'm not just saying it it's

187
00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:34,330
if the house is surreal

188
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:39,610
yeah apparently while we were there like

189
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:41,500
checking it out seems we were actually

190
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:43,570
going to get it they closed the deal bro

191
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:46,840
so like I just like it's got a size the

192
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:48,970
bases we go through [ __ ] oh it's

193
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:51,220
crazy like I feel I'm adulting I'm

194
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:52,780
buying houses and getting car upgrade

195
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,699

older Paul brother I feel like it's not

203
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:09,610
I should get involved in what's going on

204
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:11,560
on YouTube okay guys so apparently uh as

205
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:13,930
usual there's some drama going on on

206
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:20,710
YouTube and once again as usual it

207
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:22,180
involves my brother oh my god you ready

217
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:39,180
is this weird I'm sitting here I'm like

218
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:42,490
what's going on to subscribers

219
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:44,169
okay yeah oh yes I know that I'm just

220
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:46,360
like I'm trying to understand why and I

221
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:49,000
think I know why there's like some some

222
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:51,130
Jake Jake's vlog yesterday that my

223
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,110
assistant got assaulted is she did have

224
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,940
a very prominent bruise on her neck but

225
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:57,670
apparently the person who they accused

226
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:59,410
of doing this is like says it didn't

227
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:02,260
happen or something and like they made a

228
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:05,650
video against Jake and result but right

229
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:08,230
so scary it's like burning man so it's

230
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:09,940
the hell man YouTube's supposed to be a

231
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:11,950
happy place did I'm just kidding i

232
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:13,930
freaking love drama but when it involves

233
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:16,750
my brother and the accusations are

234
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:18,730
getting a serious is this I'm like I try

235
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:20,110
to take a step back evaluate both sides

236
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:22,060
whatever I don't know what's going on

237
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:23,440
I'm kind of ignorant in the subject of

238
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:26,410
discussion but I will educate myself

239
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,760
shortly here I just figured I to address

240
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:30,250
this for you the Logan but you know back

241
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,920
to the happy blog that I like guys I'm

242
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:34,870
sorry this okay so with YouTube and

243
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:37,420
vlogging everything as you guys know is

244
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:39,940
so invasive now like I've come to really

245
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:41,860
enjoy my privacy I value it so much more

246
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:43,570
now that you guys see like I said about

247
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:45,320
80% of my life I've made that sacrifice

248
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:46,700
so you guys can live and be

249
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,810
be everyday and have some for my

250
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,280
entertainment to do after you're done

251
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:50,810
with work homework whatever it is

252
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,660
watching your kids whatever the [ __ ] it

253
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:54,770
is that's what I'm here for master

254
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:57,530
that's what that's what the local gang

255
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:59,210
is here for I just okay I got educated

256
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:01,190
on the topic that I just said I was

257
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:02,660
going to get educated on I know we said

258
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:04,220
you were going to go meet Apollo today

259
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,840
but we are actually going to postpone

260
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,740
this guys I was wondering what I was

261
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,170
going to do about this whole situation

262
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:10,880
because when it comes to real-life drama

263
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:13,400
such as in this case which we're dealing

264
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,830
with alleged assault it's a little bit

265
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,780
too real for me especially when my last

266
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:19,430
name is involved in the form of g8 I

267
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:22,430
know this kid guys I've grown up with in

268
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:24,050
my whole life 18 19 20 20 20 years now

269
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:25,610
yeah I'm just gonna I'm gonna I'm going

270
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:27,290
to question Meg I'm going to question

271
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:29,180

306
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:48,470
questions to clear up what everyone's

307
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:50,660
thinking what I know and get your side

308
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:53,150
of the story and just just let the

309
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:54,920
audience form the opinion as as we know

310
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:56,480
there are two sides to every story but

311
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,340
everyone skews things in certain ways

312
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,140
and I know who you

313
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:00,610

this is the first time meeting a dog

319
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,380
before we start I just want to say like

320
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,360
this

321
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:12,520
likewise I got to be such like weird

322
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,380
tension okay I won't have your hit

323
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:16,060
YouTube dude okay let's let's just dive

324
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:19,300
right into this I want to start by

325
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:21,250
saying um and thanks thanks thanks video

326
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:23,020
something that stuck out to me and again

327
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:25,930
I'm just stating facts he never once

328
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:28,570
explicitly said that the whole assault

329
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:30,250
same by the way is Megan here yeah okay

330
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:32,200
oh hi Megan we're gonna bring her in

331
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:34,300
shortly but he never once explicitly

332
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:37,180
said that it did not happen which to me

333
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:39,580
as a viewer means there's a very good

334
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:42,400
chance something like this went down

335
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:44,380
yes so it like I did happen that's why

336
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,610
he never directly denied it happening he

337
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:47,230
knows that there's footage and the

338
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:49,420
police are getting the footage so okay

339
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:52,510
I'm that no the manager of Warwick said

340
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:56,140
no police report was ever filed yeah so

341
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:58,690
I just so happened to take a picture of

342
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:00,339
Megan and with the police filing the

343
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:01,990
police vehicle it's barely this is when

344
00:13:00,339 --> 00:13:03,250
when was this picture taken this is

345
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,780
yesterday she's wearing the same outfit

346
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:06,820
as she was in the video and my blog

347
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:08,890
whatever okay great so just to clear up

348
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:10,030
everything there a police report once

349
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:12,280
filed I'm not sure what the club is

350
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:14,290
denying that or what is the police

351
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,550
report oh I imagine the club is trying

352
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:17,260
to stay out of it guys I'm looking at

353
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:19,660
the police report right now so the tapes

354
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:21,400
are on their way which resin over here

355
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:24,970
son of a [ __ ] the fact that he didn't

356
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:27,580
know that she was on Team ten means it

357
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,839
could have been any girl which and we

358
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:31,660
just happen to have a voice to be able

359
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:33,250
to like bro would let out hotly because

360
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,640
it is a huge problem and it needs to be

361
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,339
stopped

362
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:38,290
yeah I agree I agree so that is then

363
00:13:36,339 --> 00:13:40,660
till then let's get let's go to what

364
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:42,459
banks said the reason why it may have

365
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:46,089
happened is because he was under the

366
00:13:42,459 --> 00:13:48,520
influence of drugs and/or alcohol most

367
00:13:46,089 --> 00:13:51,550
definitely alcohol but he's claiming

368
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:55,480
that a member of team 10 drugged him

369
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:59,200
which my opinion right now that is the

370
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:01,540
biggest hypothetical and a big finger to

371
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,939
point at someone so that that to me is a

372
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:05,679
wall goes up just like because I'm like

373
00:14:03,939 --> 00:14:07,599
okay like again hi let's say

374
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:10,049
hypothetically that happens still not an

375
00:14:07,599 --> 00:14:12,789
excuse to put your hands on a woman

376
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:14,379
under under no circumstances is that an

377
00:14:12,789 --> 00:14:16,449
excuse to put your hands on a woman can

378
00:14:14,379 --> 00:14:18,629
I talk to Megan yeah again would you

379
00:14:16,449 --> 00:14:21,399
mind sitting out of the circle here

380
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:21,959
there she is there's the woman of the

381
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:27,849
hour

382
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:29,859
I see this thank so you're still a

383
00:14:27,849 --> 00:14:33,369
little purple and green even a couple

384
00:14:29,859 --> 00:14:34,929
days after yeah so just to let you guys

385
00:14:33,369 --> 00:14:37,119
know when I first saw this video like

386
00:14:34,929 --> 00:14:38,439
straight up I was like I just haven't

387
00:14:37,119 --> 00:14:41,259
discussed this just like you said I

388
00:14:38,439 --> 00:14:44,739
don't around with this question for you

389
00:14:41,259 --> 00:14:51,519
why is banks denying that he was kissing

390
00:14:44,739 --> 00:14:53,409
another girl I mean I literally saw and

391
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:56,829
I remember this vividly we saw him from

392
00:14:53,409 --> 00:14:58,779
the balcony and two people I was with

393
00:14:56,829 --> 00:15:00,339
her like that bank and I was like

394
00:14:58,779 --> 00:15:02,139
there's no way he's sitting up with that

395
00:15:00,339 --> 00:15:03,399
other girl and that's not Alyssa so he

396
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:04,720
cuz he claimed to have his friends

397
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:06,399
around him the whole time

398
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,319
of course his friends are gonna have his

399
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,329
back yeah and he's like I know he's

400
00:15:08,319 --> 00:15:12,369
tweeting like stuff like screenshots of

401
00:15:10,329 --> 00:15:13,659
people texting them being like hey I saw

402
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:15,549
you you didn't do anything just like I

403
00:15:13,659 --> 00:15:17,529
could have Anthony anyone in this house

404
00:15:15,549 --> 00:15:19,599
text me and say oh I was there and I saw

405
00:15:17,529 --> 00:15:21,909
it happen it's not valid at all true I

406
00:15:19,599 --> 00:15:24,849
also want to say one thing like you're

407
00:15:21,909 --> 00:15:26,409
not an actor right I love you so anyone

408
00:15:24,849 --> 00:15:28,859
what did you come out to LA to do

409
00:15:26,409 --> 00:15:31,449
alright singing okay so where you from

410
00:15:28,859 --> 00:15:33,309
you're from Colorado you're not an actor

411
00:15:31,449 --> 00:15:34,720
I can see you're like you're sort of

412
00:15:33,309 --> 00:15:38,099
getting emotional about this guy's this

413
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:41,319
is not a girl who who has the even

414
00:15:38,099 --> 00:15:43,299
slightest ability to lie I'm an actor I

415
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:44,859
see through it I can see through people

416
00:15:43,299 --> 00:15:46,389
on YouTube like that but I think the

417
00:15:44,859 --> 00:15:48,459
problem here is that it goes beyond

418
00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:50,529
lying it goes beyond the fact that the

419
00:15:48,459 --> 00:15:52,899
people involved I'll believe what

420
00:15:50,529 --> 00:15:55,989
they're saying and they deem that as the

421
00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:57,309
truth which is which is an issue when it

422
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:59,049
comes to who you are as a human being

423
00:15:57,309 --> 00:16:00,369
because then it's not lying if you if

424
00:15:59,049 --> 00:16:01,929
you believe something is true and you

425
00:16:00,369 --> 00:16:03,669
speak that aloud and you really actually

426
00:16:01,929 --> 00:16:05,169
believe it who can blame you right it

427
00:16:03,669 --> 00:16:06,999
just it comes down to facts and like

428
00:16:05,169 --> 00:16:08,499
hopefully this video will shed some

429
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:10,119
light on the situation okay so there may

430
00:16:08,499 --> 00:16:12,620
have been a tangent I'm not a counselor

431
00:16:10,119 --> 00:16:14,480
just a vlogger the next thing I found

432
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:19,190
kind of sickening was that they said

433
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:21,380
Jake was abusive and he has assaulted

434
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:25,430
females in the past and even went as far

435
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:29,090
to say he has spit on girls I've never

436
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:31,130
seen you I'm not even kidding you're a

437
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:35,090
guy I've never seen damn my life let

438
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:37,550
alone on someone or near someone if

439
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:39,590
you're showing disdain upon them that's

440
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:41,870
not how you've ever handled your problem

441
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:42,640
so I know when I saw that I'm just like

442
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:44,960
eyes

443
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:46,310
that's fall and then when I when I keep

444
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,860
hearing these things that may or may not

445
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:50,600
be true and they're proven to be false

446
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:52,670
and false and false and false at what

447
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,260
point are used like yo this like this

448
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:55,430
whole story is that well not only that

449
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:57,170
but it's like people can just say

450
00:16:55,430 --> 00:17:00,080
whatever they want and unless there's

451
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:03,890
hard proven facts all of them then then

452
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:06,110
there's no validity and you the audience

453
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:08,089
even in any of these situations any

454
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:10,699
drama online not just this one unless

455
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:11,750
there's facts and and proof you

456
00:17:10,699 --> 00:17:13,850
shouldn't believe it because it's not

457
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:16,010
credible okay I wasn't sure which I

458
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:19,130
guess in this scenario is going to come

459
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:20,900
to fruition in the form of DVD not even

460
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:23,570
that but like for them to say that I

461
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:25,459
even laid a finger on ELISA is the most

462
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:27,350
absurd thing in the world she made a

463
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:29,480
video it was like her video that she

464
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:32,300
came out and like told the truth on

465
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:34,460
everything in the situation on why she

466
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:36,260
left the team pan out don't you think in

467
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:38,420
that video she would have mentioned that

468
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:39,890
I was abusive if she really wanted to

469
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:41,540
get everything off of her chest which

470
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:42,680
she didn't mention it there she didn't

471
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:44,030
mention that I didn't spit on there

472
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,530
there she didn't mention any of those

473
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:47,390
things and now all of a sudden she wants

474
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:52,040
to make that up and bring that up it's

475
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:53,870
childish to me that's a very good point

476
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,310
I'm not going to say anything I'm gonna

477
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:57,170
let the audience decide on that

478
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:58,640
obviously I don't take the whole abuse

479
00:17:57,170 --> 00:18:01,220
thing lightly and he also said you

480
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,980
abused Erica so they basically said that

481
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:06,020
I also was abusing Erica or something to

482
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:07,490
her or whatever it was which is the most

483
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:11,750
untrue thing in the world she lives with

484
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:14,750
me were like I'm actually so I'm gonna

485
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:17,810
call Erica and so that shows i'ma call

486
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:19,920
Erica okay yeah

487
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:22,170
she had a new number change and now

488
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:24,090
she's calling me doctor yes hey it's

489
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:24,510
Logan Paul I just have one quick

490
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:28,800
question

491
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:32,430
just like answer it truthfully yeah all

00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:38,610
honest with me has Jake ever laid a

494
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:41,600
finger on you or dare I go as far to say

495
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:45,840
as abused you in any way shape or form

496
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:47,700
literally loving never and like I'm

497
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,280
sitting here watching these videos with

498
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:53,610
people thank you spit on me and I'm

499
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:55,740
getting so like angry because I was

500
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:59,460
about to know where these British coming

501
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:59,910
from I guess honestly making me mad join

502
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,320
the club

503
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:03,510
I'm making a vlog about it it's my title

504
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:05,370
and thumbnail okay that's a lot of you

thing like that was like never happen I

508
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,880
think what you could take away from them

509
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:16,470
saying that and not having any

510
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,540
credibility on it is the fact that they

511
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:21,150
are that like most of that whole entire

512
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:22,530
video is them like making stuff up just

513
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:24,030
to fire back at me and to bring me down

514
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:25,350

515
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:27,840

00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,530
do it for fun and when our name is

542
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,910
potentially slandered and what I say our

543
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:22,500
because although he's the only one

544
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:24,510
involved he has the same last name as me

545
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,620
brothers actual factual and I think like

546
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:27,980
what he's saying is we want to use this

547
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:30,169
platform for good

548
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:31,730
and and influence people in the right

549
00:20:30,169 --> 00:20:33,679
way and how things I should be and again

550
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:35,330
we got the whole thing was drawn out of

551
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,950
proportion and getting away from the

552
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:38,240
fact that a human was assaulted by

553
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:40,070
another human which is where this all

554
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,870
started and the rest of it to me is the

555
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:44,360
S agree so just try to stay positive

556
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:46,490

anyways that's it let's go home I'm so

572
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:21,830
sorry I I listened to this interview on

573
00:21:19,429 --> 00:21:23,870
the way back of a phase talking to the

574
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:25,520
face banks talking to this guy and I

575
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:27,320
just I'm just gonna ask I'm just gonna

576
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,450
ask a couple more questions I'm so sorry

577
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:31,370
ok I stuck I'm sorry I gotta have my

578
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:33,110
brother's back especially in situations

579
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:35,360
like this but the finger pointing at em

580
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:37,360
is so big and in such a negative thing

581
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,590
Jake Paul I think you're an idiot but

582
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,150
this just isn't adding up for me okay

583
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,470
listen and I kind of like elbow the

584
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:44,660
scroll the neck or something or like

585
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:47,559
like I don't know I don't know what I

586
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:50,179
did like to this girl but I definitely

587
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:56,350
1,000% sure I didn't intentionally

588
00:21:50,179 --> 00:21:59,380
assault this girl it's just I wrote

589
00:21:56,350 --> 00:22:01,429
intentional or unintentional not stop

590
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:03,169
here okay so here's what I wanted to

591
00:22:01,429 --> 00:22:05,720
bring this up this kid is 6 foot 5 at

592
00:22:03,169 --> 00:22:07,330
the 6 foot 5 guy in a club Megan is

593
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:09,980
maybe how a taco would you see me like

594
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:11,299
by the Knicks I was gonna say 5 6 as a 6

595
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:14,270
foot got a 5 guy in a club

596
00:22:11,299 --> 00:22:15,860
unless you're dancing like this is no

597
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:17,780
not even like it was your arms down here

598
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:19,549
unless you're dancing like this and like

599
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:21,500
I've seen Fey he seems like he has some

600
00:22:19,549 --> 00:22:23,419
swag he's probably not dancing like this

601
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:26,150
like that's the only are you good from

602
00:22:23,419 --> 00:22:28,280
are you good bro that's the only way I

603
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:30,169
can see he's like karate chops his girl

604
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,490
in the neck logic people don't get hit

605
00:22:30,169 --> 00:22:33,590
here I'm trying to think even if you

606
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:35,690
even even if you swing up it's like a

607
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:37,520
chin right you swing down or like an

608
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:38,960
elbow lands on a shoulder right but does

609
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,240
there's no way that your elbow is

610
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,510
hitting this girl who is almost a foot

611
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,460
short

612
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:45,800
than you in in the neck you have to go

613
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:47,540
beneath the face under the chin and hit

614
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,470
her in the neck unintentional part

615
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:50,000
doesn't make sense

616
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:52,220
