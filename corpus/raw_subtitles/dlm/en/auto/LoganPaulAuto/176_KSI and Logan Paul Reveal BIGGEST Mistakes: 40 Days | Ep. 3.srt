00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:10,350
I'm always pushing the boundaries that's

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:13,940
just how I am okay I never thought I'd

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,940
be even a pro box at all

5
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:20,490

15,000 people watching and a million

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:32,579
plus at home I went in there essentially

10
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:34,979
beat him up there wasn't a time to fight

11
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:37,409
where I felt threatened I'm ten times

12
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:40,100
better of a boxer an athlete than him

13
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:43,229
I hate harder than unfossilized

14
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:48,809
everything better than him in the first

15
00:00:43,229 --> 00:00:50,129
fight I should have won it I want to

16
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:51,929
fight most people thought I want to

17
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:54,269
fight if there was another round I would

18
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:56,129

00:00:54,269 --> 00:01:00,749

00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:17,920
booing you at your first boxing event by

37
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:20,950
the way you're not like not really a

38
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:23,700
boxer the first fight it's sold out the

39
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:28,360
Manchester Arena and it was 1.2 million

40
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:31,720
pay-per-view buys any loss will be big

41
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:34,420
two very big names and I knew the whole

42
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:37,019
America versus the UK thing was gonna be

43
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,019
huge as well

44
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,819
it was like a movies swear to God like

45
00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:47,019
you are walking out people in this part

46
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:49,090
I look I look to him

47
00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:51,129
I remember thinking what the [ __ ] is he

48
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:52,239
wearing watch right here this is the

49
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:54,420
cheesiest thing I've ever seen in my

50
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,420
life

51
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,740
[Music]

52
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:04,890
he's suggesting

53
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:06,570
both these guys clearly have a personal

54
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:07,080
disdain for each other they got very

55
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:12,590
heated

56
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:15,120
Loden as the maturity of a 12 year old

57
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:27,480
the kid wanted to eat my face

58
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:34,140
and I felt that that cycle still the

59
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:34,620
look yeah right now they don't know what

60
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:37,230
to do

61
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,720
I noticed off the top that you know my

62
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:44,240
guy he knows how to throw punches he had

63
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,240
a good job and he was quick no he's not

64
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:51,810
logan paul what you saw was him starting

65
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:53,280
really really fast this is where I

66
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:55,260
started to get cocky because I knew I

67
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,840
was faster than him right and I was

68
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:59,730
landing punches that he he wasn't robbed

69
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,730
one I felt like the greatest boxer in

70
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:04,740
the world I literally couldn't believe

71
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:07,350
how much better I was in this man

72
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:10,200
so I started taunting him cuz I'm an

73
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:13,840
[ __ ] she's hoping to

74
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:18,170
this is this is where it gets good

75
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,170
[Applause]

76
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:26,730
[Applause]

77
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:33,810

81
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:50,070
that slightly win the respect buck

82
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:54,960
because feels like he's lost that first

83
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:55,740
rung swings are getting wild what the

84
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,510

wasn't focused on like hey I should

93
00:05:19,809 --> 00:05:21,939
probably end this fight as quickly as I

94
00:05:21,339 --> 00:05:24,219
can

95
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:26,379

right we never did it before you know he

97
00:05:26,379 --> 00:05:29,619
didn't understand about stepping up to

98
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,239
the plate after you know in combination

99
00:05:29,619 --> 00:05:33,099

100
00:05:31,239 --> 00:05:36,210

102
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:41,690
[Applause]

103
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:43,060
that he's such a dirty scumbag who was

104
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:45,920
in a hometown that's okay

105
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:47,600

117
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:37,289
in this box

118
00:06:39,059 --> 00:06:44,399
round three started zero all of a sudden

119
00:06:41,999 --> 00:06:46,439
I had nothing left I had no energy I can

120
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:49,559

161
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,309

00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:26,980
your chin yeah yeah he's conscious

167
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:41,290
I'm telling you now if he hit hard you'd

168
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:43,810
be able to tell me I said come on come

169
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:45,250
on stop there was a point in the fight

170
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:46,990
where case I got hit by like four

171
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:48,880
punches and I'm like okay he's gonna

172
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:50,380
he's gonna beat this kids ass I don't

173
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,270
know what I thought I just knew he was

174
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:55,149
showing signs of weakness so I went for

175
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:57,160
it as you sure champ in the fifth round

176
00:09:55,149 --> 00:09:58,990
I thought you know Logan kind of got

177
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,310
control of himself and he was back to

178
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:01,540
straight punch and the Atlanta some

179
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:06,149
great shots I thought was great for

180
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:08,110
frankly gt6 it up as if it's nothing

181
00:10:06,149 --> 00:10:12,220
shockingly good with puppets I'm

182
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:18,280
changing this

183
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:21,970
I literally do not remember my corner

184
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:24,790
telling me anything I went I blacked out

185
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:27,400
I'd have no idea what they said I think

186
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:31,750
at this time I said boy we need this

187
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:39,400
round we need to win this round this is

188
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:41,740
when JJ goes to tongue round six I'm

189
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:44,890
like this is gonna be the longest three

190
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:47,220
minutes of my life this is uh he's gonna

191
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:47,220
be tricky

192
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:52,520
[Applause]

193
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:55,230
good shot good shot

194
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:57,600
keeping top of him whether his fitness

195
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:59,730
wasn't quite the same level over the

196
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:04,589
rounds he started to actually empties

197
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:06,209
ten in case I came back into the fight

198
00:11:04,589 --> 00:11:09,120
times I thought case I might look to

199
00:11:06,209 --> 00:11:11,730
stop him in the contest this was such a

200
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:15,300
crazy experience fighting with no energy

201
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:16,800
for like two by two rounds now believing

202
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,300
I'm winning the fight by the way and

203
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:22,610
just knowing that I got one more round

204
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:25,470
to go just hold up and follow today

205
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:29,660
the only rounds I give him was three and

206
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:34,040
six if that I can't really do a six shot

207
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:34,040
it's really swinging the swinging

208
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:51,300
tell me he won the fight he finished

209
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,810
that fight so strong Logan had

210
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:57,209
absolutely nothing left 25 seconds she

211
00:11:54,810 --> 00:12:07,680
was talking if there was another round I

212
00:11:57,209 --> 00:12:15,180
would have finished him for sure not

213
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:17,209
this year I couldn't believe what just

214
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:19,769
happened

215
00:12:17,209 --> 00:12:25,589
he's actually gasps these they're like

216
00:12:19,769 --> 00:12:26,130
yes so many different thoughts are going

217
00:12:25,589 --> 00:12:27,870
through my mind

218
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:29,339
milton whispered to me he goes it's good

219
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:32,070
you didn't lose I'm like but I didn't

220
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:38,220
[ __ ] win okay so what's the point the

221
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:42,329
point is dissolved it's gonna be big

222
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:46,949
it's gonna be very different and let's

223
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:50,490
hope he's prepared for it looking back

224
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:51,990
in the fight you learn last year I kind

225
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:53,459
of knew what I was doing this year

226
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:55,649
there's an animal inside me there's a

227
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:58,260
killer that I I suppress because he's

228
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:59,699
[ __ ] evil but on November 9th he's

229
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,350
gonna come out and it's not gonna be

230
00:12:59,699 --> 00:13:03,990
pretty

231
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:06,240
last year I was just a white next five

232
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:07,769
I'm ending his career you're gonna see

233
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,050
much better technique I'm gonna see look

234
00:13:07,769 --> 00:13:11,370
like a professional fire it's a

235
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:13,199
different ballgame now you know I'm

236
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:14,760
seeing ksi doesn't respect a little bit

237
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:17,160
I think I'm gonna come out you're gonna

238
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:19,889
stop on punished on November this is a

239
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:21,569
big moment I believe for professional

240
00:13:19,889 --> 00:13:23,850
boxing we've seen the biggest stars in

241
00:13:21,569 --> 00:13:25,440
the world in a rematch said we need to

242
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:27,420
lose the head cuts and you got to use

243
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,399
tennis clubs the ones that really crack

244
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:31,260
it might be a little bit surprised at

245
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:33,180
just how big some of those punches feel

246
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:34,500
when you're not wearing headgear and

247
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,600
you're wearing those 10 times closer

248
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:39,389
fight night they're like weapons dude it

249
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:42,420
feels like I'm holding lethal firearms

250
00:13:39,389 --> 00:13:45,170
in my hand one right hand and I'm

251
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:47,880
putting Logan to sleep

252
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:49,110
if someone is gonna step in the ring

253
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,089
with me I'm gonna do everything in my

254
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:52,649
power to take over this person mentally

255
00:13:51,089 --> 00:13:54,750
and physically this is like a death

256
00:13:52,649 --> 00:13:56,519
match he can punch me in the face and

257
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:58,110
I'm still going to be that and then he

258
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:00,120
can punch me your face again I'm still

259
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:02,700
gonna be there and when he realizes I'm

260
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,709
still that it's gonna scare him the

261
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:06,510
first fight is any indication these guys

262
00:14:04,709 --> 00:14:07,440
are coming for each other and coming to

263
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:09,839
finish each other off

264
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,450
someone will get knocked down it won't

265
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:18,930

who the hell is gonna win JJ's

268
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,410
