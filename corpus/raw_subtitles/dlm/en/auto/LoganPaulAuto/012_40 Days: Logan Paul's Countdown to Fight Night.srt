1
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:31,370
you probably think you know me after all

2
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:33,350
I pretty much lived my whole life on

3
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:38,089
camera

4
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:41,750
you've been inside my house you see me

5
00:00:38,089 --> 00:00:44,199
doing crazy [ __ ] you know my friends my

6
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,199
family

7
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:50,609
you see me at the top and you've

8
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:54,449
definitely seen me fall

9
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:56,480
but the truth is you don't really know

10
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:56,480
me

11
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:03,420
way to go way to go you don't know

12
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:06,960
what's inside my heart and you don't

13
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:09,119
know how hard I'm prepared to work or

14
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:15,090
how far I'm prepared to go to achieve my

15
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:17,450
goals you have no idea what I'm capable

16
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,450
of

17
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,210
but you're about to find out

18
00:01:45,289 --> 00:02:01,560
I saw a digital camera in a magazine

19
00:01:55,909 --> 00:02:04,679
when I was like 9 News $150 can afford

20
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:08,190
that I'm nine years old and when I mowed

21
00:02:04,679 --> 00:02:09,989
lawns I snowboard driveways I had a

22
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:11,730
birthday party so my friends were giving

23
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:15,150
me money I remember one of my friends

24
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:17,030
brought me $20 in pennies it's actually

25
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:20,310
him right there you're an [ __ ]

26
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:23,819
$20 in pennies

27
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:26,760
for some reason I like the aesthetic of

28
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:29,700
capturing something on a screen from 10

29
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,890
to 18 we made videos Jacob I and then

30
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:35,100
Vaughn came out and we happen to pop off

31
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:36,260
on that these uh stupid little six

32
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:39,030
second videos

33
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:44,600
hey who woulda guessed good night 88

34
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:47,580
[Music]

35
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:50,910
Logan's ability to story tell in such a

36
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:52,920
short form medium was super impressive

37
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:54,870
flipping that switch to go to YouTube it

38
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,860
just took off from there he's fast this

39
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:57,300
channel that will reach a million

40
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,680
subscribers people were living

41
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,680
vicariously through him watching

42
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,269
billions of hours of content I st. Logan

43
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,370
as the biggest entertainer in the world

44
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:07,769
not a country that you can go in today

45
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:09,810
without him being known we're talking

46
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:12,269
the biggest platform in the entire world

47
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:14,250
Logan is number one for video views I

48
00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:16,670
started on vine and then I became a

49
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:23,810
youtuber and

50
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:26,090
a boxer this is weird and so I'm curious

51
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:39,560
what I was like off-camera compared to

52
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:41,600
now yeah you know hello closed my house

53
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,910
is listed on Google Maps as a maverick

54
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:48,709
house hey so this was a little out of

55
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:50,570
the ordinary I don't know how these

56
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:53,120
things get in there I can assure you I'm

57
00:03:50,570 --> 00:04:08,420
not manually putting my address into

58
00:03:53,120 --> 00:04:10,970
Google notion this house is a magnet for

59
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:16,489
crazies it's not just who knocks on the

60
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:18,140
door though we're sort of like a frat

61
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:20,329
house but we're the most successful frat

62
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:22,610
house in the world a chef cooking

63
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:24,710
full-time those guys coming in world

64
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:25,760
class box or anything that you could

65
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:28,580
possibly imagine

66
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:30,470
as far as training rest recovery

67
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:33,590
scheduling to create a championship

68
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:36,800
boxing team we're doing that the first

69
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:38,840
case I fight watching him train and the

70
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,419
passion that he has for the sport I

71
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:43,880
think surprised him as much as it

72
00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:47,210
surprised everyone else for me I'm a

73
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,350
long time boxing fan the rematch is kind

74
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:50,750
of the most exciting part of the whole

75
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:51,800
thing the intensity is just it's just

76
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:54,919
higher than it's ever been

77
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:57,410
everyone is stressed I'm stressed the

78
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:59,000
chef is stressed it's not the same when

79
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:02,060
you wake up and it's fight camp

80
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,690
good morning champ we wake up every

81
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:06,669
single day to boxing coaching Eliot 8:00

82
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:08,860
in the morning

83
00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:10,330
let's go champ look at him champ look at

84
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:12,400
him you got him

85
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:14,259
it's the champ Shannon - Shannon Briggs

86
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:20,650
two-time heavyweight champion of the

87
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:22,780
world and guess what let's don't I go to

88
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:25,840
sleep every night nightmares about let's

89
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:28,199
go just go champ by bringing in Shannon

90
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,819
the stakes jumped up astronomically

91
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:34,599
right the energy changes with Shannon

92
00:05:30,819 --> 00:05:36,729
he's just a powerful motivating energy

93
00:05:34,599 --> 00:05:39,750
force and a two-time heavyweight world

94
00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:48,039
champion that is extremely intelligent

95
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:49,840
animated I'm working loading like a

96
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:51,490
heavyweight champion but this is a

97
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,169
dangerous business and I tell them that

98
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:55,240
every day listen you can play football

99
00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:57,159
play baseball but everything is you

100
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,029
can't play boxing this is the hurt

101
00:05:57,159 --> 00:06:00,550
business man

102
00:05:58,029 --> 00:06:01,960
this [ __ ] is real Shannon is a great

103
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:04,120
coach because here's a great fighter

104
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:06,159
he's been in the ring he is that warrior

105
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,199
when he's screaming at you and telling

106
00:06:06,159 --> 00:06:09,460
you to do something look that rope

107
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:11,169
you know it's from the point of view of

108
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:13,560
hey I've done this before and by the way

109
00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:13,560
it works

110
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:29,259
[Music]

111
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:35,120
this is the only reason I'm able to work

112
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:37,760
out as hard as I am I sort of God this

113
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,850
is it's better than cryotherapy it's

114
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,990
better than any massages any

115
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:46,730
anti-inflammatories this thing the ice

116
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:49,550
bath is a miracle chamber I've never

117
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:52,580
done ice dam I hate being cold

118
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:54,740
it's like 38 degrees today I mean this

119
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:56,419
is hella cliche but this shit's all

120
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:59,060
mental I mean it really is if you can

121
00:06:56,419 --> 00:07:01,460
like go somewhere else for the first 90

122
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:03,410
seconds you're in here and separate

123
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:07,100
yourself from your body like pull your

124
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:09,950
soul out and extract it you can get over

125
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:11,900
it I think we're gonna peak right when

126
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:13,910
the fight Khans Shanna calls it baking a

127
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:16,690
cake dudes baking a cake and he wants to

128
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:16,690
make sure it's cooked to perfection

129
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:24,290
oh wait mine's got this boat right now

130
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:28,520
if any youtuber wants it you can come

131
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:31,220
get it say someone tweeted me like okay

132
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:37,040
this guy KS eyes like Jake Paul Logan

133
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:39,920
Paul I knew kiss that was like a popular

134
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:47,240
youtuber some like whoa what's going on

135
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:50,210
here it allowed Logan to focus all of

136
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:54,310
his attention on a positive pursuit that

137
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:58,340
didn't have the residue of Japan on it

138
00:07:54,310 --> 00:08:00,740
I've made a severe and continuous lapse

139
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:04,270
of my judgment and I don't expect to be

140
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:08,030
forgiven I'm simply here to apologize

141
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:10,690
post Tokyo I had not forgiven myself

142
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:16,850
yeah and I was not ready to move on

143
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:20,240
there's three million tweets trash logan

144
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:21,800
paul rot in hell without ksi calling me

145
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,990
out I don't know what I would have done

146
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:27,800
if you hadn't given me an opportunity to

147
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:34,010
fight like go back to making cringy as

148
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:36,950
vlogs we kind of kept on thinking about

149
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:39,680
it and I came up with the idea where

150
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:41,990
Logan would fight ksi and then I would

151
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,950
fight Deji his younger brother cuz I

152
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:45,350
think his younger brother started

153
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:48,110
talking [ __ ] so we were like okay

154
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:49,790
this fights happening we need to learn

155
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:52,880
how to box I've never I've never boxed

156
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:55,250
before last year ever within 48 hours we

157
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,590
were in a boxing gym I've been hitting

158
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:59,780
the paste by Logan ball before and like

159
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:02,270
it is not a joke at all

160
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:03,410
a week later I'm sparring somebody

161
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:05,990
getting punched in the face like

162
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:09,340
bleeding but in our heads it's like we

163
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:14,590
can't lose like everybody in the world

164
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:14,590
wants Jake and Logan Paul to lose I

165
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:22,940
don't think I knew how big the ksi fight

166
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,430
was gonna be the first time around it

167
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:28,400
was a massive massive thing that became

168
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:31,579
the number one bought pay-per-view event

169
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:35,279
on the internet system

170
00:09:31,579 --> 00:09:37,980
the kid can't box but he is a dog he is

171
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:41,760
an animal and I respect the [ __ ] out of

172
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:44,120
that big ego a lot of pride refuses to

173
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,120
go down

174
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:52,620
the draw the draw was a major letdown I

175
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:55,330
still think that he won the first fight

176
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:57,850
last year was the year of Elle's for me

177
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:59,649
just taking Elle's to the chin over and

178
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:01,540
over and over and over and over again in

179
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:03,670
the fight I had against JJ was my one

180
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:10,660
chance to secure some sort of win in

181
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:12,070
2018 it was a [ __ ] tie uh no I'm

182
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,860
gonna [ __ ] kill this dude I'll rip

183
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:15,660

around I got told about the first fight

219
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:22,370
and I almost wanted it to be a Paul fire

220
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:24,050
it was a really good fight when I was

221
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:25,850
asked to be involved in the rematch

222
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:27,620
I wasn't in any parts I knew it would

223
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:29,690
come with criticism they can criticize

224
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:32,060
you and the event as much as one you're

225
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:33,980
still walking out you find it 20,000

226
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:36,710
people that stay presented to fight

227
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:38,900
another men but with no protection I

228
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:41,150
said we need to lose the head cards you

229
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:43,310
got to use 10 ounce clubs the little

230
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:46,460
ones you know the ones that really crack

231
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:49,490
someone will end up face down here and

232
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:54,230
tie up and quite honestly that's what I

233
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:56,680
want now it's a proper file now someone

234
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:59,420
will get knocked out

235
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:01,520
quite honestly somebody's getting

236
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:03,380
knocked out and quite honestly that's

237
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:07,520
what I want that's right

238
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:08,660
be me and Eddie her and going at it self

239
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,130
aligning that's gonna be the new thing

240
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:11,840
so I'm gonna do that for you you're

241
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:14,530
gonna be the first guy to wear it silver

242
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,530
lining yeah

243
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:20,080
this shouldn't be allowed

244
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:22,660
I sort of God this should not be allowed

245
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:25,220
last year would fought with 12 oz gloves

246
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:26,900
and I know it doesn't seem like a lot

247
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,860
with two ounces is gonna make a lifetime

248
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:30,470
of a difference

249
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:33,200
Logan's punches in the first fight if

250
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:35,180
they're ten ounce gloves would have

251
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,390
knocked him out oh my god these are

252
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:40,250
legal - yeah yeah yeah that's the same

253
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:43,070
thing - triple G uses that's the same

254
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:46,400
one that some guys that used in I feel

255
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:49,010
like I'm holding a gun in my hands are

256
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:51,080
really quick and so if we're practicing

257
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:53,870
an 18 ounce gloves and I'm looking fast

258
00:13:51,080 --> 00:14:05,810
then and then we moved to ten ounce

259
00:13:53,870 --> 00:14:09,470
gloves for fight I'm not even

260
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:11,570
considering the effects of a loss I just

261
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:13,370
can't I can't fathom it I think the

262
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:16,520
loser of this fight will suffer an

263
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:19,240
immense and perpetual amount of

264
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,240
embarrassment

265
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:30,960
I'm an extreme person boxing is an

266
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:32,780
extreme sport every time you step in

267
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:36,150
that ring you were risking your life

268
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:38,400
part of me sort of likes that as it

269
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:49,320
makes me push myself to a level and most

270
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:51,840
humans will never dare to go busting

271
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:54,090
your nose guess what becoming nuclear I

272
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,860
would never and million years want to

273
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:58,680
get in the ring the current fire look

274
00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:02,520
I'm scared for that side there will be a

275
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:05,880
knockout it's not going six rounds this

276
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:07,260
isn't some you to [ __ ] I'm ready for

277
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:10,430
this which is the only thing in my life

278
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:14,300
that matters I'm gonna knock out his eye

279
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:14,300
and it's gonna be sick

280
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:22,790
what kind of man likes to beat up a man

281
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:27,260
trying to beat up him who enjoys that I

282
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:30,680

00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,680
