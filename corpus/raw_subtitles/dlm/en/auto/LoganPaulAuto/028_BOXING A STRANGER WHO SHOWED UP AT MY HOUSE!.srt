173
00:13:49,419 --> 00:13:52,389
quite literally showed up at my house is

174
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,730

set of Russian balls on him

179
00:14:01,989 --> 00:14:04,899
not a lot of people are willing to get

180
00:14:03,489 --> 00:14:07,149
in the ring and I'ma be honest I feel

181
00:14:04,899 --> 00:14:09,519
sort of sort of bad he probably just

182
00:14:07,149 --> 00:14:11,290

183
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,540

184
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:14,499
