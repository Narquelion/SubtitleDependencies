something for us I think it's a big deal

21
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:43,740

00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:45,899
corn bandits on Kong he's dead so as you

23
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,829
guys know this is calm yeah

24
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:52,649
Kong is dead it was killed by a coyote

25
00:01:48,829 --> 00:01:55,680
coyote vs. calm is what fair that's so

26
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:57,990
true unfair what else declared is like

27
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,869
they like that's the rat from kim

28
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,430
possible no yes yes stop interrupting my

29
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:04,160
presence

30
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:09,470
so the plan is Mike Logan we round up

31
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:10,910
five rats in a white box you put the

32
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:13,550
