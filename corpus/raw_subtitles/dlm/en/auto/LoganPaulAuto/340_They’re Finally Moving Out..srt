50
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,849
flashback like nobody's gonna want to

51
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,920
buy these as soon as you sit on him you

52
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:50,200
want to automatically drop yourself into

53
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,510
a pit of acid I feel like you're sitting

54
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,739
on a bed of nails this is uh one of my

55
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:55,840
biggest regrets in my life

56
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:57,370
$90,000 for both of these and I'm not

57
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,319
saying that - Beau's saying that so you

58
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:00,370

59
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:02,439
he's been trying to sell them forever

60
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:03,969

61
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:07,840
for seventeen thousand five hundred

62
00:03:03,969 --> 00:03:09,609

63
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,340
dollars honestly I'm just happy to get

64
00:03:09,609 --> 00:03:14,019
rid of them call them my instinct says

65
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:15,370
he's good but I've dealt if they're fake

66
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:19,169
buying this couch just to be in a

67
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:19,169
YouTube video I'm gonna be [ __ ] pissed

70
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:37,239
back story first in Miami and my

71
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,769
brother's fight he came up to me and so

72
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:40,090
he was a disowned reporter so I ended up

73
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:42,129
doing this interview with him and he's

74
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:43,449
not does no reporter then he showed up

75
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:44,739
at my house to tell me he was gonna go

76
00:03:43,449 --> 00:03:46,150

77
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:47,530

78
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:49,060
got mad at him cuz he showed up at my

79
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:53,349
house I think they're charismatic I have

80
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:56,919
a general rule of thumb understood

81
00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:58,599
lightly yeah I guess he did sneak into

82
00:03:56,919 --> 00:04:00,699
Dan's party cuz I saw him there and now

83
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:02,739
months later he's at my house buying my

84
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:03,970
