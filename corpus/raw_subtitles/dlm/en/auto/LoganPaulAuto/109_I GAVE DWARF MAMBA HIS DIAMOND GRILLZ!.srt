146
00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:34,149
growing up I worked as hard as I

147
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:39,130
possibly could whenever I was put to the

148
00:11:34,149 --> 00:11:40,899
test I would challenge myself my I would

149
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:42,850
challenge myself and I would make sure

150
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:45,160
that I am giving everything that I put

151
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:47,910
my heart into 100% effort I'm fortunate

152
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:50,410
enough to say that obviously it has paid

153
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:52,240
dividends in my life and all has allowed

154
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:54,610
me to do the through crazy shoes that I

155
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,439
do now including buy some dumbass grills

156
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:58,689
and and jewelry and stuff that I really

157
00:11:56,439 --> 00:12:00,850
don't need that's a fact but the point

158
00:11:58,689 --> 00:12:03,100
is fricking grinded bro still now

159
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:05,319
everyday grind grind grind working

160
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:07,480
extremely hard and I'm able to now

161
00:12:05,319 --> 00:12:09,279
afford these luxuries so don't think it

162
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,139
comes easy one day it's gonna happen for

163
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,910
you just put your head down humble

164
00:12:11,139 --> 00:12:15,009
yourself and work as hard as you can I'm

165
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:16,899
a believer in the idea that if you do

166
00:12:15,009 --> 00:12:20,620
good things good things will happen to

167
00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:21,070
you so I am down to spend $30,000 now at

this point

169
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:25,180
my roommate Evan he's not a boy he's my

170
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:26,860
best friend and I know one day he's

171
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:28,330
gonna return the favor or maybe it comes

172
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,980
back around full circle and someone else

173
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:31,180
