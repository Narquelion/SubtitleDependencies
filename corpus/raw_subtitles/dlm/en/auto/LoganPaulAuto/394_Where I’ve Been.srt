1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,549
it is not enough to be not racist you

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:09,750
have to be anti-racist yes believe it or

3
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:11,490
not this is progress but Logan if you're

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:34,410
gonna talk seriously about racial

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:35,790
injustice King move squirtle all right

6
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,350
jokes aside guys as you know we took

7
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,180
last week off from the vlogs as we tried

8
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,680
to push the message of equality in case

9
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,390
you didn't see my video I'm stunned that

10
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,950
we even have to still push that message

11
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,360
but apparently we do and I will not be

12
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,520
on the wrong side of history I'm gonna

13
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,870
make sure you people vote because we

14
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,579
made a lot of noise last week we went to

15
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,870
the protest we had the viral videos the

16
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:53,129
biggest thing to actually enact change

17
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,300
is gonna be meaningful follow up so

18
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:57,030
basically if you see a racist person

19
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,890
punch them in the [ __ ] throat don't

20
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,180
do that I actually probably do that and

21
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,410
then we just got a vote cuz the correct

22
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,789
thing to do here is make sure we're

23
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,470
putting people in office that will give

24
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:06,270
us the change that we so desperately and

25
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,130
unfortunately need so yeah register to

26
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:10,110

27
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:11,130

be honest all the reason I think I was

46
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:17,620
