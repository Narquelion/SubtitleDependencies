00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:39,680

are like cool and holy ass I was right

58
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,160
so Jake went on stage first to talk with

59
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:51,380
a [ __ ] boy Deji and I'm watching from

60
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:53,269
the side and I'm like holy SH this could

61
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,780
get like really violent these fans are

62
00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:56,170
crazy

63
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,170
it's

64
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:08,069
like they were throwing water bottles

65
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,810
that were completely full someone threw

66
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:12,120
a paper airplane at Jake when he was on

67
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:13,680
stage who knows how pointy the end was

68
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,200
catch one of those to the eye and that's

69
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,150
a man when we try to get out they were

70
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,010
kicking our cars the gold rolls and the

71
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:21,730
gold Bentley kids were like climbing on

72
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:24,819
top of buildings in

73
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:24,819
[Applause]

74
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:35,090
at one point full paint cans were being

75
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,090
thrown yes full paint cans

76
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:42,230
who does that so I killed someone I'm

77
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:42,230
just saying it's dangerous out there

78
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:21,020
hunched in the back of the head my dad

79
00:05:17,629 --> 00:05:22,490
did he deserve it maybe you can see at

80
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:31,610
one point at one point the press

81
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:33,139
conference he took my mic and I was just

82
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:34,909
like what the Phaedo how is no one

83
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:36,919
wrangling this man back

84
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:38,839
but whatever but still I'm joking he did

85
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:40,939
not deserve don't don't Sucker Punch a

86
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:42,439
55 year old man that's horrible sad no I

87
00:05:40,939 --> 00:05:49,729
think that dude did get tackled by like

88
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:51,770
five security guards after that anyway

89
00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:53,689
so then I'm asking myself why what what

90
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:57,169
made these fans so aggressive and so

91
00:05:53,689 --> 00:05:59,539
violent and then I remembered daddy told

92
00:05:57,169 --> 00:06:09,169
them to be go out and find if in London

93
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:11,120
its to do to me okay we'll shake you

94
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:18,050
twist the light believe it that's what

95
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:19,610
we do rest in peace dokin in a pool

96
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:21,620
that's what I'm saying rest in peace do

97
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:24,110
what you will do what you want to Jake

98
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:26,719
pool pool I'm pretty sure this is

99
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:29,170
against YouTube's policy for this exact

100
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:32,189
skin reason

101
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:32,189
[Music]

102
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,980
anyways it's my turn I get on stage and

103
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:40,230
as you can see by my face I'm like I'm

104
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:41,820
kind of already over it ksi comes out

105
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:43,110
wearing the blonde wig I thought that

106
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,250
joke was used in the last press

107
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:55,650
conference but apparently we're

108
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:56,640
recycling content okay I just feel like

109
00:06:55,650 --> 00:07:00,960
you should have maybe stuck with the

110
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:02,610
bandanna so he gets right into it and he

111
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:10,530
makes a joke about my scene being cut

112
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:15,200
from Baywatch oh you watch get the pole

113
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:15,200
and still not end up in the final movie

114
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:19,380
pretty good joke I'm not gonna lie he

115
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:21,360
got me good there but again I saw you

116
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:23,370
tweeted about this already like multiple

117
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,660
times I guess I just was confused I

118
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,890
didn't know we're still recycling

119
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,990
content but okay

120
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:30,920
but apparently JJ song made it somewhere

121
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:33,510
in the movie which is I mean that's cool

122
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:36,540
movie I feel like maybe that's why I got

123
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:38,550
an 18% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and was

124
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:40,980
Dwayne Johnson's worst performing movie

125
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:41,730
ever and in hindsight I'm kind of glad I

126
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:44,370
got cut

127
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:48,330
everyone has my back I know it has holes

128
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:51,210
besides your Ludacris mole disgusting

129
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:53,400
delusional giant it's so crazy cuz I

130
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:55,110
just thinking back I feel like he said

131
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,850
the same thing in the first press

132
00:07:55,110 --> 00:08:00,530
conference no one has your background

133
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:00,530
besides your Ludacris bone

134
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:05,220
I won't be honest with you I thought

135
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,139
sitting there at that table I thought my

136
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:08,940
dad in case I were about to go at it on

137
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:10,410
stage he's standing there on stage he's

138
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:12,060
yelling you could see like the veins

139
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:13,500
popping out of his neck even more than

140
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:16,050
my Shafi neck like bro look at this

141
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:19,080
thing right now that's just crazy so at

142
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:20,790
this point I'm like holy SH dude I don't

143
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,470
think he's gonna shut up and then he

144
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:25,500
brings up my testicle joke which is by

145
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:28,110
the way my testicle joke no hey hey hey

146
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:32,909
it's my testicle joke so let me tell you

147
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:35,969
about my test how is he about to roast

148
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:41,000
me with my own joke that I've made very

149
00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:41,000
very public I'm missing 15 percent of it

150
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:56,910
are we still recycling content Wow these

151
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:58,589
brothers sure are creative but whatever

152
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:01,470
man so I'm thinking why it is just so

153
00:08:58,589 --> 00:09:03,510
one-sided why did the moderator let JJ

154
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:05,670
talk for five minutes and 20 seconds

155
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:07,410
straight yes I timed it and why are we

156
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:11,040
not talking about the fight and then I

157
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:13,620
remembered holy asshat this dude's King

158
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,140
hates me bullying poll this kids a big

159
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:18,120
an youtuber America just a douche bag

160
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:19,529
joke why he's not hurting anyone you

161
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,850
know he's a [ __ ] idiot but who cares

162
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:24,000
he's not hurting anyone while those

163
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:26,370
things may be true and you or anyone is

164
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,709
free to have whatever opinion they want

165
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:30,600
about I just don't think the moderator

166
00:09:28,709 --> 00:09:32,220
of the press conference the person who

167
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,010
should be neutral the person who should

168
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:37,670
be the one driving the conversation

169
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:40,770
should be a Logan and Jake ball hater

170
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:42,839
skin pits bro whose decision was that

171
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:45,000
and he's the one who actually reminded

172
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:46,230
ksi to call Jake and I out after his

173
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,110
last fight because if you guys remember

174
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:50,880
ksi literally almost forgot you said

175
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:52,830
before this fight you have something

176
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,240
planned is there anything you want to

177
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:57,430
say to someone out

178
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,420

179
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:01,310
there boys

180
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:03,140
they're freaking boys bro and hehe

181
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:04,550
moderated the last press conference case

182
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:06,020
I had with Joe Weller and he knew what

183
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:08,690
he was doing then he was able to keep it

184
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:09,920
going he's even said it himself reacting

185
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:12,800
to the LA press conference

186
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:15,020
Shannon's lost it here like no one can

187
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,790
get in worded like as the media you have

188
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:19,130
to tell people when it's their tokoto

189
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:21,650
this is just it's gone please please

190
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:25,340
take your own advice you hypocritical

191
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:28,310
douche asaurus rex apparently not

192
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:29,900
Spencer apparently not look so there's a

193
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:31,400
reason I walked out there's a reason I

194
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:33,560
keep saying I'm done with the talk I saw

195
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:35,180
it's awful Daisy it's all Fugazi none of

196
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:37,250
it matters that literally the only date

197
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:38,510
that matters is August 25th and the more

198
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:40,220
and more I mature the more and more I

199
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:41,540
learn and I'm seeing this now this is

200
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:45,560
why I'm like kind of falling back from

201
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:47,900
the talking ksi you are the exact person

202
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:50,690
that I am working hard not to become I

203
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:52,970
made an unforgivable mistake back in

204
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:55,340
January and no one is ever gonna forget

205
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:57,320
that that is a part of my life now I am

206
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:59,810
the one who at the end of every single

207
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,700
day has to look in the mirror and ask

208
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:04,370
myself what the went wrong in my life

209
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:07,460
where I thought that was a good idea so

210
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:10,040
the further and further I can get away

211
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:12,170
from the Logan Paul who did that

212
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:14,240
atrocious act and thought that was a

213
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:15,980
good idea the better and you'll probably

214
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,080
make a response video talking about the

215
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:19,340
forest and how disgusting I am because

216
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,840
that's kind of the only route you can

217
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:22,460
take right now but guess what bro we've

218
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:24,470
all heard it we all know we all know I

219
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:28,100
was wrong we know I felt the difference

220
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:30,520
is every single day I am working hard to

221
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:32,360
craft a better version of myself and you

222
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:34,640

223
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,500
for example ksi I did not want to take

224
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,360

225
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,720
personal but you bring it on my

00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,260
she doesn't want that

238
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:26,810
in fact after I sense this becoming an

239
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:28,580
issue after you said this about Chloe in

240
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:30,590
your last video how's he gonna go down

241
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:33,650
on you a busted lip

242
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:36,890
I'm sorry Chloe but after the 25th of

243
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:40,010
August he liked your prostitute maybe

244
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:43,580
not I mean before the London press

245
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:45,680
conference in my what was a mature

246
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:47,510
attempt to handle this professionally I

247
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,520
had my team send your team a message

248
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:52,040
that I know for a fact was personally

249
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:54,020
received by you a message from Logan

250
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,550
keeping this offline as to not cause a

251
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:57,230
huge whirlwind that destroys everything

252
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:58,850
we've been building the past four months

253
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:00,200
ksi his comments in his video today

254
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:02,330
regarding Chloe and her sexual

255
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:04,220
relationship with Logan resemble an 18

256
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:05,780
year old ksi who sexually harassed a

257
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:07,730
woman at a gaming convention and lost

258
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:09,290
his Microsoft deal a situation that

259
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:11,750
we've decided to stray away from and

260
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:12,890
contractually agreed not to mention but

261
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,180
quote-unquote you're gonna have to

262
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:15,920
you're like a prostitute

263
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:17,840
is a bit far considering what I've

264
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,970
chosen not to bring up so JJ can keep

265
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,470
his EA deal in YouTube red show etc

266
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:23,120
trying to keep it professional and not

267
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:24,380
make an entire YouTube video about it if

268
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,880
he wants to keep hitting below the belt

269
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:27,470
that's fine but I think the

270
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,080
repercussions will hurt all parties

271
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:33,740
involved

272
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:35,270
thanks to 15 but you didn't listen JJ

273
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:37,190
and that's why I'm not going to sit

274
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:39,260
there and talk about your disgusting

275
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:40,470
sexual harassment issues in the past

276
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:43,470

00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:56,340
fingering yourself pardon what I'm being

281
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,760
nice to you

282
00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:01,680

wow I want him to blow his mind

288
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:35,600
I think that us girls need to kind of

289
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:35,600
stand up for ourselves

290
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:45,960
you talk about my girl like she's a

291
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:48,000
piece of meat but you know women have a

292
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:49,440
choice right you know sometimes they

293
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,790
don't like those comments and I feel

294
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,380
like you should have learned that from

295
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:54,540
what happened six years ago you know

296
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:55,950
what I'm talking about right when you

297
00:14:54,540 --> 00:15:00,540
lost everything because you were

298
00:14:55,950 --> 00:15:02,880
disgusting towards women it still hasn't

299
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:04,950
changed six years you're still doing the

300
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,720
same [ __ ] even when I warned you even

301
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:08,400
off-camera when I tried to make it clear

302
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,720
that this was going somewhere I did not

303
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,250
want it to go how do people not know

304
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,830
about how do you have a brand deal with

305
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:16,230
EA or any big brands for that matter and

306
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:18,060
post Malone I'm just wondering this is

307
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:21,720
the guy you want to walk out with my

308
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:24,360
girl is not an object she is a real-life

309
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,860
human being not a girl who gets passed

310
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,890
around to the dude with more ball

311
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:31,500
percentage however when it comes to the

312
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:33,870
objectification of women I'm not even

313
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:35,790
sure I have room to talk as I have been

314
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:37,600
guilty of this in the past specifically

315
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:41,150
with my music video no handlebars

319
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:49,850
it's got 42 million views this type of

320
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:51,320
content no longer accurately represents

321
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:53,540
my brand and the person that I am

322
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:56,510
becoming okay so this is no handlebars

323
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:58,959
I'm going over and I am deleting it from

00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,959

my mistakes

327
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:10,170
and honestly JJ I'm disappointed that

328
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:12,330
you haven't for six years so please stop

329
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:14,310
objectifying women especially my

330
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:15,330
girlfriend I actually did a face-to-face

331
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:17,130
with ksi

332
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:21,570
but this kid literally looked me in the

333
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:23,250
eye and told me he was God g.od God

334
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:26,130
that's where his head is that right now

335
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:28,290
I wouldn't get in the room I'm an animal

336
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:32,310
I'm a dog bro there were two of me on

337
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:35,279
the gold you're you're a god this is

338
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:38,000
what God looks like Jesus Christ we got

339
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:40,560
some work to go white woman what my son

340
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,529
toast he believes it this is crazy

341
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,360
although I would never ever proclaim

342
00:16:43,529 --> 00:16:47,760
myself is God

343
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:51,420
I do recognize this type of behavior

344
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:53,670
before JJ you are me moments before I

345
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:55,709
flew to Japan I know this type of

346
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:58,080
pretentiousness because this was once me

347
00:16:55,709 --> 00:17:01,020
you're getting too caught up in the

348
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:03,510
media the money the views the clout and

349
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:05,880
you cannot see the train that is coming

350
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:07,500
from behind you but even when I thought

351
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,510
I was just last year and I was sitting

352
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:11,220
on my high horse I would never tell you

353
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:14,040
that I would force myself upon your

354
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:16,589
girlfriend are you so insecure in your

355
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:18,630
boxing ability that the only insults you

356
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:20,610
have are attacking my friends and my

357
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:22,439
family but dog it's a little too late

358
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:24,660
now because there are no press

359
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:27,630
conferences and the only day that's left

360
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:30,660
is August 25th and you my friend are a

361
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:33,859
stepping stone for me to get better
