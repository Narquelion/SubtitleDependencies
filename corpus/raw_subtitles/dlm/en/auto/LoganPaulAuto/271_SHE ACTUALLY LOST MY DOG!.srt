the park and steal Kong from her and

184
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,959

ninth floor of the other building so

194
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:21,820

195
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:25,630
Kong twice in one day

196
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:28,600
good job Ayla - we can't have assistants

197
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:35,170

didn't lose my dog we're

203
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:46,530
the way I think part of the challenge of

204
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:48,210
this is gonna be hiding the Yeti his

205
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:49,740
vehicle stands out a lot so we're gonna

206
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:51,270
have to like park around the corner and

207
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,470
then swoop in but I have a plan I have

208
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:55,260
every angle covered

209
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:56,970

227
00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:48,430
say for herself literally I can't

228
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:56,920
imagine losing this dog twice in one day

229
00:11:48,430 --> 00:12:03,339

on the phone and she's still preoccupied

232
