51
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:47,170
barriers of traditional Hollywood as

52
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:49,629
Internet star turned actor political

produced by MGM it's that that lion that

59
00:03:00,579 --> 00:03:05,079

61
00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:12,579

65
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:24,400
Chef I did a demolition derby I've

66
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:25,599
wrestled an alligator I dressed up as an

67
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,970
old person for the day and went to a

68
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:30,099
retirement home oh yeah I hitchhiked

69
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:31,870
from Canada to Mexico and I was the

70
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:33,970
mayor of a small town in Louisiana for a

71
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:35,410
weekend and lastly let's not forget

72
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:37,000
about my movie airplane mode starring

73
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:39,069
your favorite social media stars coming

74
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,579
to YouTube Reds in January I don't know

75
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:41,579
if I'm alive

76
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:49,320
yeah so that's cute that's fufu

77
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:50,730
but the biggest game-changer for me the

78
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,650
thing that helped me build all of this

79
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,630
was when I started the hottest clothing

80
00:03:52,650 --> 00:04:01,710
line on the market maverick by Logan

81
00:03:54,630 --> 00:04:03,660
Paul we had our first maverick pop-up

82
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:06,080
shop in New York and we shut down Soho

83
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:08,940
for three days straight

84
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,560
he's insane seeing everyone joining the

85
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:12,810
revolution and following the brand

86
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,310
literally we possibly work City Kings

87
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:15,840
about 40 million dollars because the

88
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:17,640
planning wasn't the best that's my bed

89
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,180
New York I also took my shirt off hit

90
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,180
head what's new

91
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,860
but it's funny because the second pop-up

92
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:40,180
store was actually on a first class

93
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:41,950
flight to Dubai and just a little

94
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,810
forewarning I don't think I'm allowed to

95
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:47,400
fly on it again throw me off the balloon

96
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:48,730
but it's all good cuz that was fire baby

97
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,410
Wow

98
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:52,000
life is amazing guys I've learned a lot

99
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:53,530
this year too and I think even though

100
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,820
I'm a young charge everyone can take a

101
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:57,280
piece of wisdom with them from my

102
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:58,660
experiences cuz I've done a lot of guys

103
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,000
I believe that life is all about a

104
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:03,220
mindset it's about perspective or how

105
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,040
you look at things for example check

106
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:07,930
this out hey so for me guys the grind is

107
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,610
real like I'm barely sleeping but I

108
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:11,830
found what it is that I love so I

109
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:14,020
started saying I don't work but I work

110
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:15,310
hard maybe start thinking like this I

111
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,900
don't have to go to work

112
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:18,640
I get to go to work right I don't have

113
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,350
to go to school I get to go to school I

114
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:23,520
get to learn think grow better because

115
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:23,520
not everyone has that luxury

116
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,900
needless to say 2017 was absolutely

117
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:30,160

118

189
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:27,570
this year number one exceed expectations

190
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:29,280
it's not overachieving but it's always

191
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:33,540
doing that little extra step to impress

192
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:35,550
people to the theory of yes but know

193
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:38,120
where everything is possible until it's

194
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:40,830
not and even then it's still possible

195
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,080
number three your team your squad the

196
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:44,040
people who you surround yourself with

197
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,540
make sure other people who are willing

198
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,980
to put their heart and soul into every

199
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,080
project you undertake and people who are

200
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:52,390

what is no-one else doing

212
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:20,410
it's called market-making personally my

213
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:21,850
goal isn't to be the biggest actor in

214
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:23,380
