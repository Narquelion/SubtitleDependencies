thing ever every day I just pull in on

41
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,670

the west coast custom as you guys know

44
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,780
we've had some problems with the bus ah

45
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,130
in example the horn

46
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:32,330
we had to shove this water bottle

47
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:34,190
underneath it because if you take it

48
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:36,110
I'll literally does not stop honking

49
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:37,640
probable so have you figured out how to

50
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:39,560
use the Wi-Fi yeah which is a problem

51
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:43,130

on with duct tape get you just hell but

56
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:57,140

00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:58,489
with Devin in the cool bus bang oh you

58
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:00,440

on the highway I did tell me that was

60
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:15,920
