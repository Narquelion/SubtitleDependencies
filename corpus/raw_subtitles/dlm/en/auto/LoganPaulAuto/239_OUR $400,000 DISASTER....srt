actually missed a flight or a train i've

108
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,640
always like made them by the hair of my

109
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,840
skin this is kind of

110
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,000
sad anyway called my business manager

111
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,360
andrew

112
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,720
i asked him last night in the middle of

113
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,160
the streets of italy if it was even

114
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,799
possible for me to get the car this was

115
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,759
last night

116
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:23,440
last night this is hypothetical if i go

117
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,240
to the factory tomorrow

118
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,560
and i see this and i and i want to buy

119
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,400
it

120
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,840
because i put down the 25 000 do they

121
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,600
still have it could i still do that is

122
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,160
it that is that even an option like my

123
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,360
exact

124
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,639
lambor the one that i customized is at

125
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,199

i'm gonna see it

127
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:47,120
we could tomorrow switch things around

128
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,120
as you can still get it

129
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:53,040
it's hypothetical it's all hypothetical

130
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,919
bro this could go down future logan take

131
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,360

train and hopefully don't miss that one

134
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,840
it's a good time to say

135
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,199

209
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,120
middle of nowhere in italy it's going

210
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:18,080
down you're

211
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:21,759
[ __ ] crazy you see your lamborghini

212
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:23,680
is italian that's multicultural

213
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,879
i don't know why i'm excited i don't

214
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,400
even know what i'm getting right now we

215
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:41,839
missed our training

216
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:41,839
oh yeah are we late

217
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:50,099
[Music]

218
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,000
you already spoken with my colleagues

219
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,880
because you should leave

220
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,839
all your cameras here oh they are not

221
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,080
allowed

222
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,519
oh yeah so slight issue right now and i

223
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,920
think this is part of the reason i was

224
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,440
like

225
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,279
on the fence about getting a lambo

226
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,320
hearing those words like no filming bro

227
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,120
just might as well just

228
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,760
stab me in the chest yeah is my like is

229
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,959
my car

230
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:19,200
in there so i can't film it

231
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:22,160
no i'm gonna go all the way to italy

232
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,839
listen buy a 400 000 car and they won't

233
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,839
let him film it

234
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,600
so we're having a little powwow over

235
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,560
there i'm hoping they let us film bro

236
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,839
cause

237
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,279
that would destroy the point of

238
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,360
literally like the reason we're getting

239
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,279
lamborghinis is because of you guys the

240
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,640
viewers the logang the jake paulers and

241
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,720
if we can't film

242
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,760
what like what it doesn't make it making

243
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,839
no sense in the brand of the logan paul

244
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,600
talking to the boss lady the boss man we

245
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,240
were told hey come to italy

246
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,399
order performante pick it up we'll do a

247
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,080
hole on field tensions

248
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,680
tensions are high like that was your guy

249
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,160
that was from you guys you guys said

250
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,720

vehicle is buying

253
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,120
the 400 000 vehicle don't you think you

254
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,760

255
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,839
that

256
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,839
it is

257
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,120

258
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,519
