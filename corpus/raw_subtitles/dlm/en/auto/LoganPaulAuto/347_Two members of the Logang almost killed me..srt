182
00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:00,179
from the bus for real yes it's my toy

183
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:01,709
look at it don't touch it

184
00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:03,029
I have a problem with them looking on

185
00:11:01,709 --> 00:11:05,610
this picture they're standing on my

186
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:06,389
bumper that's that's very that's very

187
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:07,889
disrespectful

188
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:09,870
we had the same problem with the Yeti

189
00:11:07,889 --> 00:11:11,579
this is Merriman Piper thank you for

190
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:14,910
being the low game but does not your

191
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:16,829
property so please a stay away from the

192
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:18,600
bus unless I invite you on it and be

193
00:11:16,829 --> 00:11:20,429
especially especially when I'm not

194
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,990
around don't touch your bus don't go on

195
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:23,519
the bus and don't put objects in the way

196
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:24,839
that can potentially harm that's the

197
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,670
second thing think about where you place

198
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:28,410
that like I could have died

199
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:30,569
I couldn't vlog could be over right now

200
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:32,850
and a local box between grown-ass men

201
00:11:30,569 --> 00:11:34,620
possibly a woman pooping outside my bus

202
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:36,360
and low gangsters trying to kill us it's

203
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,949
been an interesting one looking for

204
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,410
cameras right now whether you're taking

205
00:11:37,949 --> 00:11:45,809
pictures on my bus or hopefully near my

206
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:48,389
bus it's our big day the damn Wi-Fi

207
00:11:45,809 --> 00:11:50,160
security cam I would hate to be someone

208
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:52,440
trying to poop outside my bus what do

209
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,230
you think Lydia

210
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,519
great we'll take five yo okay so I'm

211
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:58,110
looking at this camera here look it's

212
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:00,540
pretty cool some stuff we found out that

213
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:02,459
actually works in our favor hugely 24/7

214
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:05,310
video 130 degree view shows you

215
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:07,949
everything in 1080p HD day or night to

216
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:10,439
open the day pooping the night find you

217
00:12:07,949 --> 00:12:12,029
bro alerts you on your phone see who is

218
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:13,949
there and talk back to get their

219
00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:16,290
attention like I could be sleeping and I

220
00:12:13,949 --> 00:12:18,870
get a notification I swear to God I will

221
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:21,959
get up out of my bed and sprint naked to

222
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:25,949
the bus why make it make you sleep big

223
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:27,660
fine this guy our 24/7 continuous

224
00:12:25,949 --> 00:12:29,220
recording saves everything just in case

225
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,750
so even if I don't catch this guy if I

226
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:33,060
come back tomorrow there's an extra poop

227
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:34,500
dunzo got caught last thing part of the

228
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,610
puzzle that's actually kind of confusing

229
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,560
mmm

230
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:41,430
that is an outlet we can't turn the

231
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:42,870
generator generator on cuz pooper will

232
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:44,519
know that something's going down in the

233
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:45,540
bus so we got over the extension cords

234
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:46,889
over here and then we're gonna walk

235
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,870
around here try to find an outlet like

236
00:12:46,889 --> 00:12:50,250
drape it put it on top of the bus and

237
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:53,220
then just hook up some cameras and

238
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:57,089
hopefully find this guy bro if we do bro

239
00:12:53,220 --> 00:13:00,560
I bought a flashlight for this exact

240
00:12:57,089 --> 00:13:03,209
look at look at that poop look at it ah

241
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:06,180
disgusting I never thought my life would

242
00:13:03,209 --> 00:13:07,620
come to this Oh 100% outlet the one

243
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:11,329
thing I'm worried about are these spikes

244
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,329
a little bit you'll be fine okay cool

245
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:22,519
and I'll live okay so right here baby

246
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:24,470
you are my Savior I also feel like I'm

247
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:25,699
sort of breaking the law right now but

248
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:28,249
like you would think that if there's

249
00:13:25,699 --> 00:13:31,429
security here they would catch the guy

250
00:13:28,249 --> 00:13:33,170
pooping outside my bus he open so that

251
00:13:31,429 --> 00:13:36,410
security camera right there is watching

252
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:38,119
us install a security camera okay so

253
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:39,499
it's connected to the bus Wi-Fi but

254
00:13:38,119 --> 00:13:40,910
obviously when we turn the bus off it's

255
00:13:39,499 --> 00:13:42,559
not going to be connected anymore but in

256
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:43,970

00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:49,779
