movie and you say I'll take you know two

35
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:03,200

36
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:06,200

37
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,540

38
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,220

00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,870
where two people are on top of each

46
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:22,880
other and they wear a trench coat and

47
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:24,050
they go into the movies as one person I

48
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,570
think we're gonna make this happen all

49
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:28,489
we need is disguise so we go and Evan

50
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:32,750
you be the you be the head and you say

51
00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:35,150
one ticket and we save money we only

52
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:37,100
spend money on one ticket instead of two

53
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:43,340
quick question how much is rent here a

54
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:46,130
lot of money bro 10 to 20,000

55
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:48,200
potentially a month yeah yeah so movie

56
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:54,140
ticket us how much like 12 bucks and

57
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:57,350
$0.50 my calculations are correct boys

58
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:59,870
we're looking at 36 bucks a month save

59
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:01,840
if we make just a few more cuts we could

60
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:04,519
even think about starting to eat again

61
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,530
listen are you Roy there's only one way

62
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:09,019
to do this actually for real and that is

63
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:10,730
we needed a very large trench coat a my

64
00:03:09,019 --> 00:03:12,080
wonderful assistant Danny okay you can

65
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:15,080

67
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,500
how much was it 160 bucks do you think

00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:20,150
it's big enough it was the biggest I

69
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,410
could find so let's hope it's big enough

70
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:24,049
because that's one question

71
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:26,350
you spent 160 dollars to try to save 12

72
00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:26,350
