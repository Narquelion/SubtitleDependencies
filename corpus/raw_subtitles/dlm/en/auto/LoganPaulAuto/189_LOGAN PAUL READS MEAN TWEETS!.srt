little more effective you know a little

92
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:07,200
more meaningful because they're just

93
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:08,970

content do you think there's a chance

107
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:38,539
that by telling someone to spit in my

108
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:43,030

118
00:05:11,599 --> 00:05:14,780
making a video about something dead

00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:26,840
good just found out that Chloe Bennet is

122
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:28,550
hanging out with Logan Paul again is it

123
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,870
weird that I trust her judgment Urso

124
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:33,340
strongly that I'm willing to give him a

125
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:33,340
second chance based solely on that

126
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:37,310
Thanks

127
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,900
I really love Chloe Bennet so I'm just

128
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:40,099
gonna give Logan Paul another chance to

129
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:45,009
be a decent human being

130
00:05:40,099 --> 00:05:48,380
starting over wow thanks man

131
00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:50,509

00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:52,310
that thank you okay guys as you can

133
00:05:50,509 --> 00:05:54,500
imagine there are definitely plenty more

134
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:56,210
that are just as amazing I'm so sorry if

135
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,680
I did not get to read your your hateful

136
00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:00,620
messages but that is it for now all

137
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,289
jokes aside Twitter and I guess just the

138
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:04,699
Internet in general can be a pretty

139
00:06:02,289 --> 00:06:06,379
volatile place so for each one of the

140
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:08,300
tweets I read I'm donating five hundred

141
00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:10,190
dollars to stomp out bullying org

142
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,719
they're an amazing organization that

143
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:13,849
does amazing work and at the end of the

144
00:06:11,719 --> 00:06:19,960
day we all we all need to be better

145
00:06:13,849 --> 00:06:21,110
better say that word we're man murder

146
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,930
boredom

147
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:25,729
Letta beauty and imma throw the revenue

148
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:27,169
that this video makes to them so go

149
00:06:25,729 --> 00:06:29,000
ahead and leave a like on it so it hits

150
00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:29,539
that YouTube algorithm and we get them

151
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,490
views

152
00:06:29,539 --> 00:06:33,860
definitely think the hate should stop if

153
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:35,360
you ever feel yourself going to leave it

154
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,370
hey comment or say something mean or

155
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,770
unnecessary to someone do me a favor

156
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:42,020
oh no it's not worth it because it is

157
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:43,490
easy to sit at your computer or have

158
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,930
your phone and hide behind one of these

159
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:46,699
hide behind your keyboard and type your

160
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:49,070
mean comments but at the end of the day

161
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:52,130
we got one life on this floating rock in

162
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:54,470
the middle of an infinite universe

163
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:57,590
so let's spread love baby let's spread

164
00:06:54,470 --> 00:07:00,080
positivity get your March lump all calm
