like dangle some

46
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:17,310

street and just be like like posting bro

48
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:22,290

51
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:29,250
piece of furniture or yo [ __ ] sick

52
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,450
like what okay first off we need the

53
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:33,120
proper chair right this can't be just

54
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:42,750
some other like foo-foo chair kind of

55
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:45,150
like me hey I'm gonna put this on the

56
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,900
forklift yeah bro oh but but it's so

57
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:49,200
nice I know

58
00:02:45,900 --> 00:03:06,359
it's still gonna be nice you'll be on a

59
00:02:49,200 --> 00:03:07,889
forklift no I'm a different breed well

60
00:03:06,359 --> 00:03:09,569
I'm actually freaking out yo you know

61
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:21,239
what the best part about this is the

62
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:38,729
Gucci make sure to tag me on the video

63
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:40,530
at Logan ball okay so you got the two

64
00:03:38,729 --> 00:03:41,970
forklifts on the forklift we have to get

65
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:43,560
a piece of wood to set across it that

66
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:44,669
you can put the chair on but here's what

67
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,449
the physics come in here's with the

68
00:03:44,669 --> 00:03:52,620
physical here's where the physics here's

69
00:03:48,449 --> 00:03:54,269
where that you got this I believe in you

70
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,979
here's where the physics come in there's

71
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:57,989
gonna be a lot of weight right in the

72
00:03:55,979 --> 00:03:59,760
center of the to force right here

73
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:01,560
there's nothing underneath it so the

74
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,590
piece of wood has got to be durable like

75
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:07,590
that can not can not break and people

76
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:14,069
could die and I don't want that oh that

77
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:15,629
would be good click babe I have no IDE

78
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:17,519
we can't have that we can't have a might

79
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:20,690
work bro like you will fall 20 feet and

80
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,690
die oh I want that

81
00:04:20,739 --> 00:05:20,380
the first time in my life early I hate

82
00:04:40,930 --> 00:05:28,020
you early everywhere everywhere watches

83
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:31,720
take me up Brendan hey we're going up I

84
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:34,300
got the dopest neighbors in the game

85
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,639
the world is mine I have a forklift in a

86
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,090
chair and a nice chair at that oh here

87
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,550
we go

88
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:41,259
oh he's pushing me up oh my gosh I'm so

89
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:42,849
high up literally if I fell I would

90
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:44,050
break my tailbone look I'm not scared of

91
00:05:42,849 --> 00:05:45,370
heights that's not the issue the issue

92
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:47,349
is that I could just slip off at any

93
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:49,750
moment like the board on metal is a

94
00:05:47,349 --> 00:05:50,199
slipper he'd probably look ridiculous

95
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,210
right now

96
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:54,070
aka my whole life I mean I could touch
