camera I understand why it's like this

67
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:36,320
intense because we literally shot a

68
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:39,250

the face of spoons and [ __ ] this is the

77
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:41,460
worst thing I figured since Jake and I

78
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:42,900
were beefing and stuff and we may or may

79
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:44,190
not have settled in the music video this

81
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:47,130
sees us together interacting for the

82
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,680
first time we had two other questions

83
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:51,449

said oh that Justin Bieber just shot

137
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,380
some 100% true and there's no proof of

138
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:58,090
hundred percent in Justin Bieber shoot

139
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:00,010

they want on the Internet but where's

147
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:26,890
the validity so yeah what the [ __ ] you

158
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:17,230
Justin Bieber but no but I'm not saying

159
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:19,900
is that's what I'm hearing Justin Bieber

160
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:25,720

that hey look can you hand me the camera

166
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:38,410
you got a tattoo of pewdiepies dick on

167
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:41,050
your leg he said that well I think that

168
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:44,230
the reason why I got a tattoo of a few

169
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:44,740
devices no because the me looks like a

170
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,330
gun

171
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:47,770
but Beauty by that said his dick looks

172
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:51,160
like that the reason why is because I

173
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:55,270
wanted to pay homage to him Oh ask me

174
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:57,250
why why why his most viewed video in the

175
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:58,870
past like five months of me and I was

176
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:02,500
