185
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:48,020
car accident and he's saying someone got

186
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,600
hit by a car

187
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:52,190
if that is true my sincerest apologies

188
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,930
guys obviously that was never my

189
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:55,460
intention I hate hearing about like

190
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:56,780
people getting hurt like negative stuff

191
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:58,490
like this going down when like to me

192
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,930
it's just like it's all positivity it's

193
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:01,820
all fun I show up and get this my dream

194
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:03,530
car back and like I said banks and I

195
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:05,390
scream I apologize earlier in the vlog

196
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:07,460
before I even got this text I said I'm

197
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:09,740
sorry and I'm sorry to hear about what

198
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:11,990
happened but we try to maintain control

199
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:13,760
in the situations I brought them out and

200
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:15,320
then managed to close the gate it's just

201
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,330
so hard because there's so many people

202
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,550
and not enough of me or Brendan's to

203
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:21,900
like push everyone back freaking Lydia's

204
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:24,730
getting trampled herself like

205
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:26,230
but the point is I hope now everyone is

206
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:27,760
safe and hope everything's okay what

207
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:32,410
that said let's get back to the fun

208
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:36,880

what's happening is it how bad is it

215
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,000
