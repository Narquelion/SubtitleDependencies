thanks guys nice why are you down okay

51
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:30,440
well before he's anything else I want

52
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:32,990
you to see my pitch why you should have

53
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:36,350
my baby by Logan Paul you're pretty hot

54
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:40,130
and I'm like I'm alright and I think

55
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:43,780
together we'd make a beautiful baby look

56
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:46,880
how cute she is it's not at all your dad

57
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:51,560
is Jose Canseco the homerun header and

58
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:54,500
my dad is well he's great Paul I have

59
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,630
reason to believe we'd have an athletic

60
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:59,360
baby just because of my dad well cuz

61
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:01,790
he's athletic what about your dad he's

62
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,490
great and then our athletic baby could

63
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:09,640
ride the horse I just got you I also

64
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:09,640
think a baby would make me mature faster

65
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:15,410
interested so far but I think you'll

66
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:17,450
like the next slide as you can see by

67
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:19,820
this chart income on the vlog channel

68
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:22,100
decreases over time but if you look

69
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:24,140
closely the income on the family channel

70
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:27,470
increases over time do you wanna have a

71
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:29,720
kids you can make more money yeah

72
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:31,790
take the ACE family for example they had

73
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,400
a good run they're really entertaining

74
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:41,540
and awesome but step aside A's family

75
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:44,000
it's time for the Paul's all right I

76
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:45,640
feel like do you think I don't know

77
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,530
there's only one way to find out baby

78
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:50,400
what do you say

79
00:04:48,530 --> 00:05:07,710
you know what you might have changed my

80
00:04:50,400 --> 00:05:09,750
mind really kid by myself you stick your

81
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:12,470
face in the dog poop baby you smell too

82
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,470
