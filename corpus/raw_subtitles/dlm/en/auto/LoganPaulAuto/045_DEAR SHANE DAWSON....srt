1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:13,769
dear Shane Dawson I tweeted this before

2
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,809
the series was out when the teaser was

3
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:22,400
released I said don't underestimate hard

4
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:22,400
work trains teaser just turned into or

5
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:29,070
did first off I love what I'm seeing I

6
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,990
love it Shane you are an amazing content

7
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,030
creator you are changing the game you

8
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,890
are paving the landscape of what could

9
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,719
be the future of YouTube and Shane knows

10
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,940
this I I'm friends with Shane I'm

11
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,340
cordial with him we DM today it was

12
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,230
romantic and but when I'm watching this

13
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,480
series there's just a few things I

14
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:47,700
thought I was trying to stay out of it

15
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,960
by I want I need to address them because

16
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,370
Shane the people are watching this

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,930
you're young and impregnable audience

18
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:57,270
you're young and impenetrable audience

19
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:59,430
you're young and impressionable audience

20
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:03,329
will not know any better so I'm here to

21
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:05,700
cut that [ __ ] once again makes a whistle

22
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:07,380
noise when I drink that's the first

23
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,229
stuff like I said I think information is

24
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:12,510
being told in a way that is extremely

25
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:14,880
misleading and that's what I'm here to

26
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,830
clarify also I get that not everyone

27
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,740
likes my brother and me included like

28
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,330
the Paul family is just currently

29
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:23,220
surrounded by controversy a fault of our

30
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:24,689
own plot but he made a comment in

31
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,729
episode one that just tickled me the

32
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:27,420
wrong way cuz I could like I know he's a

33
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:29,009
good dude

34
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,380
and that's why this content works cuz

35
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:33,240
everything he's doing is so genuine and

36
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,640
authentic and you will watch this dude

37
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,770
for 45 minutes straight who's doing that

38
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,250
on YouTube no one and you gotta like him

39
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,020
too

40
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:42,030
he's a likable guy for the record by the

41
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,229
way Shane also said in Episode two Logan

42
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,759
I feel like it's more likable

43
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:47,369
thanks man I'm going off on a tangent

44
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,649
ways in episode 1 right at the beginning

45
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:51,299
as he's setting the stage he said this I

46
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:54,720
thought it was just cringing you know

47
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:57,810
yeah that's all I can might be Logan I

48
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,759
didn't know they were different I don't

49
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:02,159
know why you said that cuz you know

50
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,890
that's not true I think it was cuz it's

51
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,479
very easy to also hop on the train of

52
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,649
like I don't like the polls he's one of

53
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,000
the biggest youtubers in the world like

54
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:11,129
he knows who you guys are not only that

55
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,110
about two years ago I hung out with

56
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:13,350
Shane for like an hour and half I did

57
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:16,710
his

58
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:21,270
Podcast you're gonna start did it start

59
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:24,240
odd oh I was on his podcast Shane and

60
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:25,590
friends featuring Logan Paul I think we

61
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,420
sat in the same room and talked for like

62
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:29,600
an hour so either a you're not telling

63
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:34,470
the truth be you forgot Who I am

64
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:36,930
amnesia classic classic YouTube brand or

65
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:39,150
C like I said it's it immediately gets

66
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:42,500
people on board to be like oh you're

67
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:42,500
right I didn't even know there's two

68
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:55,020
maybe I anyways he said this and I

69
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:56,940
started to not doubt but immediately I

70
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,530
was like well how much of this will be

71
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,630
truthful but again I'm going on a

72
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:08,190
tangent the original point I'm trying to

73
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:12,230
say is Shane you you are scaring your

74
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:16,230
young and interminable honey you are

75
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:19,980
scaring your young and Independence Day

76
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:23,460
audiences like this whole a second

77
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:26,280
episode is just suspense music and then

78
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:29,720
the b-roll the b-roll where did you buy

79
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,720
this b-roll

80
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,770
did you get this stock footage that is

81
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,959
not getting I would love to see your

82
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:41,380
search history human eats human out of

83
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,940
hands

84
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:47,020
why are you doing cannibalism who's the

85
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:48,760
sociopath man series is making me ask so

86
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,980
many questions no but this is this leads

87
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,720
into the point of what I want to say to

88
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,670
that is actually educational the meat of

89
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,780
this video that you guys can stick in

90
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:57,310
the back of your mind from when you're

91
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,200
watching the rest of the series the

92
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:01,360
buzzword that Shane is focusing on in

93
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,010
the reason why he's sitting down at this

94
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:07,209
therapist house who also offered in the

95
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:17,709
drink is sociopath so she's a sociopath

96
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:20,500
so she sociopath sociopath again before

97
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:22,510
I say anything guys i DM shane about

98
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,880
this I gave him my opinions because I

99
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:25,510
it's quite simply it is not black and

100
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,729
white

101
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:30,550
99% of the time someone is not a

102
00:04:27,729 --> 00:04:33,340
sociopath or not a sociopath my opinion

103
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:35,350
is there's a sociopathic spectrum at

104
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,910
which point some people lie higher on it

105
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:38,950
than others and by the way some of the

106
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:42,910
biggest businessmen in the world could

107
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:45,640
be considered sociopathic mark jobs no

108
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:47,910
Steve Zuckerberg Mark Zuckerberg and

109
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:50,530
Steve Jobs a lot of people especially

110
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:52,270
youtubers and Shane touched on this you

111
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:54,210
can't just say like you're a sociopath

112
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:57,460
the word I would like to use is

113
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:58,030
sociopathic tendencies so a lot of us me

114
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:01,539
included

115
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:04,270
we'll do some dumb [ __ ] be some stuff

116
00:05:01,539 --> 00:05:06,039
that lacks empathy strictly for views

117
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:08,260
right it gets us views which gets us

118
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:10,720
subscribers a motivating factor is to

119
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:14,950
reach the next next next level sociopath

120
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:17,919
is boil down someone who is just more

121
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:19,690
savage than everyone else I know it

122
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,190
sounds stupid but I'm making it easier

123
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:23,950
for you to understand cuz the way a

124
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:26,229
sociopath was described in part 2 of the

125
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:28,180
series quite honestly could be applied

126
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:29,740
to most people someone even tweeted at

127
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:31,479
Shane I need a voice of concern Ashley

128
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,740
and Dawson this isn't a call-out but how

129
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:34,479
much thought was put into the idea that

130
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:36,070
after a video like your latest that any

131
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,240
awkward kid including ones with

132
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,950
disabilities could be labeled a

133
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,539
sociopath due to your audience's

134
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:41,800
youthful and experience and another

135
00:05:40,539 --> 00:05:43,330
person said if you think about it like

136
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,919
deep down doesn't everybody fit the

137
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:46,389
scription they gave four sociopaths I

138
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:48,250
feel like most people I know are that

139
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:50,500
way and don't even try very hard to hide

140
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:52,719
it yeah like it's so hard to say and the

141
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:55,389
big sticking point I'm having with it

142
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:58,479
Shane I feel like is trying to make out

143
00:05:55,389 --> 00:06:04,150
a sociopath to be synonymous with

144
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:07,240
Psychopaths the words sound very similar

145
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:09,099
but mean very different things and again

146
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,169
for the young and interpret all audience

147
00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:13,210
they will confuse the two and think

148
00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:15,460
psychopathy means sociopath

149
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:18,759
not the case in fact in Shane's video

150
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:21,310
itself Hillel say the word and then show

151
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:24,129
the word psychopathy I want to talk to a

152
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:26,139
psychologist if he is a sociopath hey

153
00:06:24,129 --> 00:06:29,110
everybody today I want to talk to you

154
00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:30,639
about the word psychopathy and I want to

155
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:32,349
make that clear because even in Shane's

156
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,810
video itself there's a couple times

157
00:06:32,349 --> 00:06:37,210
where he will say the word sociopath but

158
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:38,949
show something psychopathic or even show

159
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:41,349
the word psychopathy I heard Steve Jobs

160
00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:43,479
I don't care about that I heard Steve

161
00:06:41,349 --> 00:06:45,490
Jobs was a sociopath yet the thing says

162
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:47,379
with Steve Jobs of psychopaths what say

163
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:49,960
yes you're confusing people and the

164
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:52,120
reason I'm so intrigued and feel

165
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:54,430
compelled to say something about this is

166
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,810
because at the beginning of the year I'm

167
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:58,240
gonna open up here for a sec you guys

168
00:06:55,810 --> 00:07:00,789
can imagine tons of people even people

169
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,650
in my circle close friends like yo your

170
00:07:00,789 --> 00:07:04,539
sociopaths straight up and I didn't know

171
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:06,069
what the word met cuz I like is it a

172
00:07:04,539 --> 00:07:07,629
psychopath is that what it is so I

173
00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:10,839
looked it up and I had to ask myself I'm

174
00:07:07,629 --> 00:07:12,219
like Oh sociopaths and for sure some

175
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:14,199
things I fit the description of that's

176
00:07:12,219 --> 00:07:16,120
why I'm saying I prefer if we're gonna

177
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:17,919
label Jake a sociopath or not doing it

178
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,719
on a spectrum and where he lies on it

179
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,120
because again it's not just black and

180
00:07:19,719 --> 00:07:25,539
white to quote the great Aristotle

181
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:28,330
there's levels to this so is Shane a

182
00:07:25,539 --> 00:07:30,099
sociopath I don't know he's like clearly

183
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:35,610
I don't want to say forcing but these

184
00:07:30,099 --> 00:07:35,610
reactions seem a little socio-economic

185
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:51,190
you know this bro I love you this is a

186
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:53,259
classic case of dramatics

187
00:07:51,190 --> 00:08:04,090
on YouTube yo Logan I left your car keys

188
00:07:53,259 --> 00:08:06,220
on the counter I don't know bro he's a

189
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:08,889
genuine authentic guy but I get I feel

190
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:11,250
like some of this is slightly theatrical

191
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:14,530
cuz I just don't think this reaction

192
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:16,419
elicits itself in every sentence like

193
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:18,610
you see that easily jarred in real life

194
00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:20,949
like by simple things well last time say

195
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:25,960
I've met him what did when you shook his

196
00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:28,449
hand was he like but 10% of me 10% of

197
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:30,219
that Shane was existent just like bro

198
00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:31,810
you mean me in real life like I'm pretty

199
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:34,329
calm like whatever but I have that part

200
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:39,640
of me it's like but does that make me a

201
00:08:34,329 --> 00:08:41,500
sociopath according to this therapist

202
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:43,719
check it then they also are impulsive if

203
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,899
I was impulsive I would use that clever

204
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:48,610
pun because my last name is Paul

205
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:53,680
impulsive and create a podcast coming

206
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:55,029
sooo to a screen near you I'm also not

207
00:08:53,680 --> 00:09:00,550
wearing pants does that make me a

208
00:08:55,029 --> 00:09:01,959
sociopath I have a [ __ ] pig this

209
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:04,450
video it's not black and white

210
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:06,070
sociopathic to be quite honest with you

211
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:08,320
it's nothing to be like scared of like

212
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:10,390
if your friend might be a sociopath or

213
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,500
has sociopathic tendencies he's not

214
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:12,670
gonna stab you in the middle of the

215
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,380
night when you're not looking I don't

216
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:17,380
think cuz what if he's a sociopath an

217
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:18,670
aside then you plenty simple you look
