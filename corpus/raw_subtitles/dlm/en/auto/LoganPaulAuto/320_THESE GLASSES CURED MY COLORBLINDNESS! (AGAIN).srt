can see that my eyes are ridiculous I

61
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:34,400
guess I'm trying to do here is like

62
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,780
three years have gone by since the color

63
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,430
blind bTW I'm wondering if I'm still

64
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,840
colorblind it turns out I am some of

65
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:41,180
these things I just cannot see wait what

66
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:44,990
are you guys so you guys just see

67
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:47,390
nothing I cannot see Bri you have really

68
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:48,530
real trouble with teals and greens

69
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:50,690
oh-oh-oh

70
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:52,100
Roatan colorblind I'm pretty sure when I

71
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:53,750
made the video back in the day was mild

72
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:55,760
and now it's strong now they're trying

73
00:03:53,750 --> 00:04:01,250
to sell you a glasses well that's the

74
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:02,780
thing maybe now that it's more severe

75
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:05,270
than it was in the past somebody call a

76
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:06,590
tree a tree up we got to gotta go to the

77
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:15,950
new your sunset which I believe is

78
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:16,670
happening inconveniently one hour so

79
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:18,230
beautiful

80
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:20,000
you know last time I did this guys I got

81
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:21,109
pretty emotional you remember but that

82
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,490
was before I grew a dick

83
00:04:21,109 --> 00:04:23,870
so hopefully this time I'll be able to

84
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:25,340
collect myself but it's just hard

85
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:27,680
because you know when I look out I see a

86
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:29,480
black and white landscape nothingness

87
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,520
and ideally these glasses will make me

88
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,900
see a little bit more vivid crisper

89
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,000
definition of this landscape

90
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:39,710

101
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:14,310
exaggerating it like yeah I didn't need

102
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:16,350
