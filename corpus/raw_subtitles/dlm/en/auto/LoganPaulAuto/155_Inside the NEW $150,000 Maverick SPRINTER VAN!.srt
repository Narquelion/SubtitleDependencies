shipped back to LA on a truck hey guys I

99
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:09,110
got a confession to make this video was

100
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:10,760
shot like two weeks ago we've been

101
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:12,440
hiding the Sprinter from social media

102
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,940
we've been using it in LA like we went

103
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:22,940
out last night we partied a little bit

104
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:24,770
here's what that looked like it's just a

105
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:26,480
great thing you know but ideally we

106
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:28,790
finish this vlog with some sort of epic

107
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:30,200
race between the cool bus in the the

108
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:33,050
Sprinter van we just didn't have time

109
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:35,040
but here's a really of what that might

110
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:37,010

111
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:39,210
[Music]

112
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:41,380
[Applause]

113
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:43,240

114
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,710
to just like just talk for a second and

115
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,420

116
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:48,400

00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:51,220
open up my emotions I'm not gonna lie I

118
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,110
