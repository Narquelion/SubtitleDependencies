because I love him but he's here

70
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:32,010
building a fence for us before you could

71
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:33,420
see through the gate and obviously we

72
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,800
don't want people looking at us whenever

73
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,780
running around naked and whatnot so

74
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,069
who's been filling in the gap with spice

75
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,200
literally this thing is looking like a

76
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:41,550
castle sharp pointy spikes for

77
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:49,980
everyone trying to break into my house

78
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:54,840
we got to keep the security tight oh god

79
00:03:49,980 --> 00:04:03,569

80
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:07,170
woman's but it's just a medium I came

81
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:11,250

87
00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:39,120

88
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,830

dangling from the helicopter I've seen

94
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:14,520
in this clip or maybe this clip we had

95
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:16,200
to glue Jake's putting glue on the ends

96
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,760
of the air pods here this might actually

97
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,830
be scarier than the helicopter what if

98
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:28,050
the glue guns in my eardrum I can't hear

99
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:29,820

arts and crafts store that crafts I mean

115
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:10,040

117
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:17,910
