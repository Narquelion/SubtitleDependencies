lot of good stuff here dude it's weird

122
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:02,100
because people wear these eccentric

123
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,720
outfits and it takes place in the desert

124
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,190
so it's hot in the day and really cold a

125
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,290
nice so your outfits range from pretty

126
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:09,390
much being naked to like big big heavy

127
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:11,220
furs maybe if you just wear that maybe

128
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:13,020
if I like just that like no wonder we're

129
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:15,090
just straight-up four great yeah that's

130
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:17,090
a good move oh is that dwarf mama or is

131
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:20,220
that

132
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:22,500

134
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,250

137
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,130
those video it's a little awkward

138
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:38,450
