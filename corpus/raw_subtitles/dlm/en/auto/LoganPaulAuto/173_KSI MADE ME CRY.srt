they actually know how to fight this is

18
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:04,059
not a gimmick anymore I'm no longer a

00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,690
youtuber right now I'm a professional

20
00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:09,250
fighter I'm gonna treat it like that

21
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:11,350
people die in this sport this is a

22
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:13,390
dangerous sport I'm not gonna go to war

23
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:14,880
without my weapons and to get those

24
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:17,890
weapons takes years of training

25
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,740
dedication passion so I don't think the

26
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:23,520
average creator can do that this is this

27
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:23,520

36
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:48,780
everyone was getting so high last year I

37
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,490
was a youtuber first and a showman first

38
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,409

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,630
to look good this year I'm a boxer first

40
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:56,909

plus hours to sort of decompress a lot

91
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:38,320
of [ __ ] was said in the press conference

92
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:40,450
my opinion I got a little out of hand I

93
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,580
went somewhere that unfortunately I

94
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:44,140
didn't want to be mentally and I'll

95
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:46,090
explain that I'm gonna sort of give you

96
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,920
guys a play-by-play of what was going

97
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:50,020
through my mind I will say everything

98
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,940
that I said was true starting off with

99
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:53,800
even just seeing JJ because mind you I

100
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:55,840
haven't seen the kid physically in

101
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,320
person for a year the last time we were

102
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,370
locked in a 20 by 20 foot square

103
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,380
literally just beating the [ __ ] out of

104
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:04,270
each other I was excited to see what I

105
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:06,130
would feel like when I was when I was

106
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:08,770
face-to-face with him again I wish I

107
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:11,950
could say I felt something when I saw

108
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:16,090
him there was no apprehension there was

109
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:17,139
no it was just a pure sense of

110
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:18,969
domination

111
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:20,860
and when I looked in his eyes not only

112
00:06:18,969 --> 00:06:23,020
could I see the fear on him his eye was

113
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:25,030
still bleeding from the last fight if

114
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:27,520
you all remember post August 25th the

115
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:29,529
kid had a blood vessel popped on his eye

116
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,689
I think from a couple of my jab and when

117
00:06:29,529 --> 00:06:33,580
I was looking at him he had a brown spot

118
00:06:31,689 --> 00:06:35,770
where the blood vessels were pop and as

119
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:37,779
soon as I saw that I got crazy confident

120
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:39,639
cuz I was like yo this was from a year

121
00:06:37,779 --> 00:06:41,590
and a half ago and I've scarred this kid

122
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:43,629
I've left him something that's gonna be

123
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:45,370
with him for the rest of his life the

124
00:06:43,629 --> 00:06:47,199
kid is gonna look in the mirror and to

125
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:49,360
be reminded of me that was with head

126
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:53,349
guards and 12 ounce gloves with no head

127
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,819
guards yo oh so then the press

128
00:06:53,349 --> 00:06:56,590
conference started and I hate to say

129
00:06:54,819 --> 00:06:58,360
this but before it started I tweeted

130
00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:00,340
time to do what I do best and that is

131
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,740
quite honestly when I want to flip the

132
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:04,680
switch be an [ __ ] like I can be an

133
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:09,590
[ __ ]

134
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:11,930
[Applause]

135
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:13,820
and this press conference is that it

136
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:15,860
kind of sucks because this press

137
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:18,080
conference is like the epitome of the

138
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:20,600
worst version of myself the one that

139
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,010
just prods and pokes and is a little

140
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,960
cringe and it's just yelling and

141
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:26,330
screaming and saying mean stuff but then

142
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:28,100
again that's my job I feel like as an

143
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:29,780
entertainer as a boxer and my job to

144
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,010
sell tickets and move product I'm here

145
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:32,570
to put on a show you don't have to like

146
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:34,070
me you can hate me I'd rather you hate

147
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:35,630
me than feeling different about me but

148
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:37,040
at least you feel something and you're

149
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:38,510
out there gonna come and watch me beat

150
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,550
the [ __ ] out of the kid or you're gonna

151
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:43,340
come watch me to go watch you mean to

152
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:45,590
watch me to watch me get beat up I don't

153
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:47,060
know what happened there know we're

154
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:49,370
sitting here and Eddie Hearn is talking

155
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:51,020
and I'm like yo this like my opponent is

156
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:52,190
sitting four feet from me why would I

157
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:54,260
not turn to my right and just start

158
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:55,910
saying some [ __ ] so some dude handed me

159
00:07:54,260 --> 00:08:01,190
a cup of of ice water

160
00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:02,389
I took the ice and he got mad the team's

161
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:05,210
kind of gotten a little bit of a scuffle

162
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:06,979
but you know I'm such a [ __ ] punk

163
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:08,840
dude and I know it I've been away from

164
00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:11,030
this kid for a year and a half and he's

165
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,860
right there and I'm fighting him like

166
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,760

167
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,530

197
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:14,940
[Music]

then I go up there it's my turn to talk

199
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,910
I don't feel like staying in one

200
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:19,290
position it's not my thing I like to

201
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:20,970
walk around I like to be mobile and so I

202
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:22,800
go to remove this mic and a few people

203
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:23,640
might have noticed this if you hit me in

204
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,410
the head

205
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,270
all right listen soon as they hit me in

206
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:29,370
that I was like no this is not to do a

207
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:30,840
good start but you could see I pull it

208
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:33,480
yank it up and it just comes right down

209
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,680
and like hits me I was like in case I am

210
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,940
good all notice and they started

211
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:40,710
laughing starte and minds you guys I

212
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:43,110
have no monologue prepared when they

213
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:45,570
told me it was open format I'm like yo

214
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:47,520
okay I don't know what this like do I

215
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:49,140
just stand out there and talk and be a

216
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,730
bully first like the goal is obviously

217
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,770
to piss the kid off but there's no

218
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:55,020
question there's just like I go speak

219
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:56,850
about what dude the first thing I go for

220
00:09:55,020 --> 00:10:00,180
obviously is Deji the brother who

221
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:02,880
disowned him where's that yet where the

222
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:05,280
[ __ ] is that yet where's your family at

223
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,230
I like responding to ksi better like

224
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:09,750
last year he said so many things and I

225
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:11,220
wasn't quite as quick and witty as I am

226
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:13,470
now I think actually partially because

227
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:15,480
of the podcast talking on impulsive at

228
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:18,480
length has made me much better at being

229
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,500
able to respond real-time and so I don't

230
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,900
really know what I'm doing here I

231
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,040
thanked his parents for birthing him so

232
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:26,280
I could be dishing out of him

233
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:28,860
mr. and mrs. ksi thank you for giving me

234
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:32,370
the opportunity to beat the [ __ ] out of

235
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:34,050
your [ __ ] son and by the way I stand

236
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:35,970
by that like thank you guys I would love

237
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:44,340
to give you a gift card of some sort

238
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:46,080

239
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:48,750

00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:06,060
being honest with you he didn't he

248
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:11,610

252
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,610
your wig bro so I started getting

253
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:19,020
confused here cuz he was saying that was

254
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,910
that was my weight he was telling me to

255
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:22,710
take off his bandana and then I was

256
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:24,470
saying last year if you guys remember at

257
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:25,940
that press conference last year I tried

258
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:27,530
the bandana I ripped off the wig and

259
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:29,480
then I tried to take off the bandana it

260
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:31,280
was super glued to his head so yeah I

261
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,990
got super confused I started to question

262
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:34,730
everything around me I was like yo this

263
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:36,440
is a space crime time continuum broken

264
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:38,120
cuz I could have swore could've sworn I

265
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,530
ripped the wig off real easily and then

266
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:42,080
the bandana was the thing I couldn't get

267
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:43,520
Wow by the way your own your brother

268
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,500
said I'm gonna win this fight hey that

269
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,970
is true that is true Deji his own

270
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,160
brother said I had the edge in this

271
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:51,380
fight no good has an edge I don't know

272
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:53,180
what isn't connecting with people when

273
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:54,530
they say that they think ksi is gonna

274
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:56,150
win this fight cuz I see a lot of the

275
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:57,560
Twitter pulls and stuff and ksi is

276
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:58,970
actually he's the favorite right now

277
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,320
technically I'm the underdog which I'm

278
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:01,670
totally cool with I love being the

279
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,930
underdog but I don't get it

280
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:07,310
it's cool though it's a cool opportunity

281
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:09,440
your suit is nice your suit is Usami on

282
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:11,900
every doll at this point cuz every time

283
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,420
this do poster youtube videos are you

284
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:15,890
doing maybe this is why your pupil looks

285
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:17,480
like a fine meatball I don't know

286
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:18,890
wherever dolls been if he's out making

287
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,360
YouTube videos but how many times can

288
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:21,740
you put me in a video before you realize

289
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,480
like yo you should probably focus on

290
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:28,300
making your kid the best athlete you can

291
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:28,300
your suit is loops get a better tailor

292
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:34,460
you gotta pay more oh my god I just

293
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:36,200
realized maybe that's why I don't show

294
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:38,450
up maybe that's why you got this brick

295
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,160
[ __ ] of a man holding pads for JJ

296
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:42,830
and not Vidale so that this was funny

297
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:46,670
but Vidale had to encourage JJ to go he

298
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:48,680
said go get him JJ go go do your best

299
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:50,420
job so this was cool with JJ walked up

300
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,950
finally I'm like yo I don't have to just

301
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:53,390
start holding [ __ ] from my ass I can

302
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:54,740
respond which is what I do best

303
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:56,240
that's it before I talk about you Logan

304
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:58,160
I want to talk about J let's talk about

305
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,780
a chain rule quick that's your opening

306
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:04,520
your opening is yo let's talk about Jake

307
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:06,440
where's the JJ from last year where's

308
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:09,530
the JD who brought the props he had the

309
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:12,290
wig and everything I wanted that JJ and

310
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:14,450
the first thing he says was let's talk

311
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:16,340
about Jake and I can see why I think

312
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:19,370
Jake made him upset when in our first

313
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:22,480
face to face Jake came up to JJ and blew

314
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:22,480
smoke in his face

315
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:32,730
nice yo this dudes talking about

316
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:34,470
spelling I like it for those you don't

317
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:36,270
know what semantics mean it's the branch

318
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:37,890
of linguistics concerning with meaning

319
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:39,240
so I'm like what the [ __ ] is this kid

320
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:42,180
saying he's talking about like a

321
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,020
spelling of the word [ __ ] my brother's

322
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:45,690

00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,750
couldn't sell on a 50-person venue in

362
00:15:40,829 --> 00:15:44,490
your own country so that that was me

363
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:46,410
just getting under his skin because he

364
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:47,670
went on this music tour while I was

365
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:49,019
training this past year at half a if you

366
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:51,360
guys didn't know this he was on tour and

367
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:53,279
some of the venues were so small and not

368
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,750
sold out and as an artist that is one of

369
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,759
the most embarrassing things ever his

370
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:58,079
music videos cost Hawley between fifty

371
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:59,910
and two hundred thousand dollars each

372
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,620
and they get like what two two two to

373
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:03,420
eight million views let's just say JJ's

374
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:05,100
music career is not probably going the

375
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:07,529
way he wants it to I put my hands okay

376
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:09,300
so first of all you look like you're

377
00:16:07,529 --> 00:16:10,740
running with a dildo up your ass what's

378
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:17,550
wrong with having a dildo up your ass

379
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:22,529
shout out to Jordy where'd your

380
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:26,940
personality go like a easy

381
00:16:22,529 --> 00:16:29,339
hey JJ has no dick I reached a point

382
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:32,190
where I realized like after he sat down

383
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:34,170
even just the way he's seated he's kind

384
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:36,750
of slouched over like this body language

385
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:38,639
experts will tell you it's a defeated

386
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:40,410
demeanor everything about him had just

387
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,480
sort of given up and and by the way I

388
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:43,740
actually kind of get this if you all

389
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,259
remember in the press conference last

390
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:48,630
year when I went to England I sat down

391
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:50,459
you could see my face I was kind of sad

392
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:51,899
I didn't really want to be there I

393
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:53,160
wasn't having the best day ever I was

394
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:54,930
kind of tired and that's what happened

395
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,220
if you remember I literally just left

396
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:58,529
because I was like this I don't want to

397
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,939
be here and I I sensed that a little bit

398
00:16:58,529 --> 00:17:03,990
with him here so then this is where the

399
00:16:59,939 --> 00:17:10,079

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,710
after the press conference and the dude

476
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:09,510
is just not in good shape

477
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:11,070

479
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:14,940

482
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:19,260
absolutely honest with all my content

483
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,970
the past six to eight months I've been

484
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:23,310
shot I've tried to be extremely real

485
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:25,650
with you guys after that day my

486
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:25,980
confidence even more so than it already

487
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:28,110
has

488
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:30,810
as skyrocket I don't know if he's

489
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:33,870
satisfied with the amount of money that

490
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:36,570
he's made from this fight or what but

491
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:38,220
that fire that JJ had last year that ksi

492
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:39,180
that I thought last year was gone that

493
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,290
kid was gone

494
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:42,630
dead and gone the kid I'm fighting now

495
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:44,820
feels like he thinks he should be

496
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:47,070
working hard and he should say certain

497
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:50,520
things to offend me there's no substance

498
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:53,040
there the wall was was broke down way

499
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:55,560
way way too easily so yeah I hope he

500
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:57,060
loses sleep every day knowing that I'm

501
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,980
working harder than him knowing that I

502
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:00,210
have more valuable assets on my team to

503
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:02,190
him knowing that I'm also working

504
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:04,470
smarter than him everything about our

505
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:06,420
