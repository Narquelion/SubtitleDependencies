239
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,890

polish the pooper clean him up a little

241
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:39,150

242
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:40,710
light of the moon we found the knife

00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:42,300
section now let's be honest we already

00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,390
pooper but this is just for fun there's

246
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:48,780
so many options you could do like the

247
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:54,110
classic like box cutter I could do the

248
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:54,110
fillet light English fillet knife

249
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:03,690
