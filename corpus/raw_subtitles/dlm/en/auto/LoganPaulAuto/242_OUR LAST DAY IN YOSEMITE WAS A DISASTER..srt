trailer stays attached to the bus yeah

65
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,579
well we're low on gas which probably hit

66
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,950
it

67
00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:12,099

68
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:16,599
Ovilus

69
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:18,879

everything is looking pretty good

74
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:28,540
hopefully nothing else goes wrong

75
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:32,109
the issue is we haven't gone kayaking

76
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:33,760
yet and if you look here on top now

77
00:03:32,109 --> 00:03:35,829
there's also a second issue what we're

78
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:42,090
dealing with here is a Class C grade a

79
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:45,579
level 10 red alert rapid holy Sh I just

80
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:47,019
I just don't know about the risk factor

81
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:48,459
here because the issue is right you come

82
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:50,079
from up the river you can't tell if

83
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:57,760
there's a waterfall down there this is

84
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:59,590
what I see happening there is somewhat

85
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,540
hope here if there Andy what's your

86
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:03,549
background and rowing again I mean I won

87
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:10,689
the national championship we're dealing

88
00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:12,010
with a national championship row okay

89
00:04:10,689 --> 00:04:15,189
it's like the waterfalls that are

90
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:17,109
waiting for it you never know the point

91
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:18,909
is I kind of trust being with em but

92
00:04:17,109 --> 00:04:23,169
just this might not be the move I didn't

93
00:04:18,909 --> 00:04:24,820
really want to get is that you mean

94
00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:26,470
laughs well turns out the microphone

95
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:28,479
broke so here's the voiceover here's me

96
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:30,190
being [ __ ] but we found a river that

97
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,539
was less calmed it didn't appear to be a

98
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:33,039
red alert rapid we were kind of just

99
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:34,630
hoping there weren't any waterfalls but

100
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:36,159
didn't know for sure anyway so got the

101
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:37,599
guy act down Haydon as you can see

102
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:40,060
really helped out with that we got our

103
00:04:37,599 --> 00:04:41,409
life jackets on then because safety made

104
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:44,229
a joke that I apparently thought was

105
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:45,909
funny shop the life jackets on nice and

106
00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:47,770
tight probably too tight definitely yeah

107
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:49,449
too tight carried the kayak down to the

108
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:50,860
launching pad and then proceeded to plug

109
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:52,419
