60
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:16,790
we brought my boy Kong to SAP she hasn't

00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:18,680
been as cute as he could be right no

62
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:22,760
okay yeah all of us had this realization

63
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:24,800
Kong has gotten ugly I know okay I know

64
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:27,620
it's tragic it's not okay look it's not

65
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,810
like he's like ugly he's uglier then he

66
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:32,030
was like I sound bad but I don't know if

67
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:33,290
you guys remember original like og com

68
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:35,960
look at this guy look at him in his

69
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:37,370
heyday puppy Kong off fluffy and all

70
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,940
cute like he used to be a little

71
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,260
puffball

72
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,790
he was so puffy it's like if I had a

73
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:42,650
hundred of him and strike them down I

74
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:44,450
could literally I could start a cereal

75
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:46,340
brand maybe called mini cons and they be

76
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:49,070
looking amazing and I would put

77
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,639
Kellogg's out of business fact but I

78
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:53,389
digress

79
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:55,580
Kong his hair now has gotten long and it

80
00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:57,590
flows down his back like lays down it's

81
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:59,660
not puffy and he write it just like I

82
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:04,760
mean it's no Blaine so Brennan what did

83
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:06,200
you say today no I would think that by

84
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,150
giving a haircut it wouldn't make them

85
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,919
fluffy I think it'll help just puff him

86
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:11,930
back up I don't know the actual science

87
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:13,460
of dog hair growth okay I'm not a

88
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:16,970
scientist I'm not God I'm pretty

89
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:21,320

112
00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:48,529
it as he described it as a cold that

113
00:06:46,729 --> 00:06:51,379

117
00:06:54,409 --> 00:06:57,529
hopefully you know I'll feel up soon but

118
00:06:55,939 --> 00:07:12,110
yo oh oh

119
00:06:57,529 --> 00:07:14,089
what that's definitely not okay okay I'm

120
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:15,979
a little bored we wanted to come pick up

121
00:07:14,089 --> 00:07:18,019
Judy you guys know Judy she's the

122
00:07:15,979 --> 00:07:20,119
Spanish girl who cusses a lot and calls

123
00:07:18,019 --> 00:07:22,009
me stupid a lot so we're gonna go pick

124
00:07:20,119 --> 00:07:23,989
her up literally just to honk the train

125
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:27,619
horn in her face which actually brings

126
00:07:23,989 --> 00:07:29,300
up a funny point my brother Jake is not

127
00:07:27,619 --> 00:07:31,099
so funny actually it's getting sued for

128
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,629
this exact thing the issue is he did it

129
00:07:31,099 --> 00:07:34,339
to a stranger not someone he knows so I

130
00:07:32,629 --> 00:07:36,999
guess technically yes Judy could sue me

131
00:07:34,339 --> 00:07:36,999
but Judy

132
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:56,880

147
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,500
bubbles dog grooming doesn't sound legit

148
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:07,970
barking at that fake dog that's a fake

149
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:10,010

157
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,350
leave his fluffy lion mane and just trim

158
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,780
down his body

159
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:31,550
what if we did the opposite and just

160
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:33,980
shaved his face and then leave his body

161
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:35,930
funky yeah we could do stripes like

162
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:39,350
donuts around his body I grow stripes

163
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:41,270
yeah I like how Kong can be so hype and

164
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:46,430
