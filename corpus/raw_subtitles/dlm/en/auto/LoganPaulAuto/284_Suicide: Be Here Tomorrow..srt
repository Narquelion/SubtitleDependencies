1
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:13,510
for 40 minutes crying like a baby

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:16,540
bikers joggers tourists runners they

3
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:19,360
went by me police officers searching for

4
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:22,270
suicidal people want Bobby twice I'm

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:24,040
standing at the ledge leaning over the

6
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:25,599
rail with tears flowing down to the

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:28,509
waters and I thought to myself

8
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:31,180
absolutely nobody cares and then the

9
00:00:28,509 --> 00:00:34,780
voice in my head said jump now and I did

10
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:37,230
and the millisecond that my hands

11
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:41,050
cleared the rail my legs flew over it

12
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:44,110
was an instant regret the depression was

13
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:47,460
wiped from my mind and all I wanted to

14
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:50,080
do was live and I thought it's too late

15
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,300
Kevin Hines was 19 when he jumped off

16
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,590
the Golden Gate Bridge he is one of the

17
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,030
many incredible people that I've been

18
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:57,040
grateful to meet over the past three

19
00:00:55,030 --> 00:01:00,010
weeks as I aim to further understand the

20
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:03,340
complexities surrounding suicide I know

21
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:06,700
I've made mistakes I know I've let

22
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:08,229
people down but what happens when you're

23
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,090
given an opportunity to help make a

24
00:01:08,229 --> 00:01:11,890
difference in the world the backlash

25
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:14,170
against the social media star very

26
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:15,549
popular guy called Logan Paul is in some

27
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:17,350
honkies are complete and utter

28
00:01:15,549 --> 00:01:19,479
insensitive idiot I'm gonna break from

29
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:21,179
daily vlogging he says his latest

30
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:24,840
content was his biggest mistake

31
00:01:21,179 --> 00:01:27,189
apologize to the victim and his family

32
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,409
it's time to learn from the past as they

33
00:01:27,189 --> 00:01:31,420
get better and grow as a human being I'm

34
00:01:29,409 --> 00:01:32,889
here to have a hard conversation so that

35
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:36,100
those who are suffering can have easier

36
00:01:32,889 --> 00:01:38,319
ones so I've never been so humbled in my

37
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:41,679
life by a single event were you kind of

38
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:45,429
shocked but I was shocked to discover

39
00:01:41,679 --> 00:01:47,920
just how big this is you've never known

40
00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:49,179
anybody that killed themselves no one no

41
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,380
one that was know as that was part of

42
00:01:49,179 --> 00:01:51,909
the problems just my ignorance on the

43
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,770
subject I didn't Ohio where you come

44
00:01:51,909 --> 00:01:54,520
from it's the second leading cause of

45
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:57,369
death

46
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:59,229
and I know while I'm not able to solve

47
00:01:57,369 --> 00:02:00,639
the problem by myself I want to be a

48
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:02,920
part of the solution and that solution

49
00:02:00,639 --> 00:02:05,130
began across the country in New York

50
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,130
City

51
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:13,879
we sat down with dr. Chandra the

52
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:18,049
director of the National Suicide

53
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:20,180
Prevention lifeline we have to change

54
00:02:18,049 --> 00:02:22,849
the conversation publicly from just

55
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:25,280
focusing on suicide and how something

56
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:28,819
bad is happening and say well what do we

57
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:31,040
do about help people understand that the

58
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:32,450
first thing they need to do is reach out

59
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,860
and talk to somebody when they're

60
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:36,260
feeling in despair because you're not

61
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:38,329
alone with anymore they've done studies

62
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:40,069
with people who are who are experiencing

63
00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:42,409
any kind of pain including hanging off a

64
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:48,739
cliff you can hold on a lot longer if

65
00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:51,260
somebody is right there with you I think

66
00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:52,790
as a society as human beings we just

67
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,049
have to be more compassionate and that

68
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:55,639
includes me too that's something I'm

69
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:57,109
learning along this journey and

70
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:58,790
something else that dr. Draper told me

71
00:02:57,109 --> 00:02:59,959
where the five steps that anyone can

72
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:02,150
take to help prevent suicide

73
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:04,010
step one is simply just ask and ask

74
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:05,480
yourself ask others are you thinking

75
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:07,190
about suicide and I know that sounds

76
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,720
like a daunting question but literally

77
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:10,790
that question can save lives

78
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,340
step two accordingly would be to listen

79
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:15,470
be present don't make any judgments and

80
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:16,669
then step three would be be there for

81
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:19,250
them even after you've already asked

82
00:03:16,669 --> 00:03:21,799
because dependability is key step four

83
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:23,750
is then help them connect whether it's

84
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:25,579
with a friend a family member or local

85
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,900
suicide hotline therapist but help them

86
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:28,790
reach out to someone so they don't have

87
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,500
to deal with this alone lastly Step five

88
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:32,269
is just checking on them show them that

89
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,410
you care call them up say hey I want to

90
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:35,299
make sure you're okay can I check in

91
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:37,549
with you over the next few days so one

92
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:40,760
of the things that is so important about

93
00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:43,250
reducing stigma is getting stories out

94
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:45,079
there about people positively coping

95
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,739
with suicide do you guys know anyone I

96
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:48,169
could talk to

97
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:50,000
with the lived experiences absolutely we

98
00:03:48,169 --> 00:03:51,560
have quite a number of people that we

99
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,120
could deliver over to you yeah

100
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,000
that'd be great yeah and that's how we

101
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,010
got introduced to Kevin Hines seventeen

102
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,300
years ago Kevin jumped off of the Golden

103
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:03,150
Gate Bridge and survived

104
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:06,300
these are individuals whose stories when

105
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:09,330
people hear them they say you know maybe

106
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:12,540
I can get through as opposed to hearing

107
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:13,980
the stories when people happen and those

108
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,420
unfortunately those are stories that

109
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:17,430
we've heard before now we're hearing

110
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:19,320
more and more stories of people being

111
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:21,299
more open about it as I was saying

112
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,910
before Logan for every one person that

113
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:25,230
dies by suicide there's 287 other people

114
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:27,300
that think seriously about it but don't

115
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:29,100
those are stories again that have not

116
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,690
been told if we told those stories of

117
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,760
people who got through it as opposed to

118
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:33,990
one who didn't imagine what kind of

119
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:37,410
influence that would have on people's

120
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:39,090
behavior when I found out that one in

121
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,440
six high school kids seriously think

122
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:43,680
about suicide that's that's stunning

123
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:47,790
yeah this is such a common problem Logan

124
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:51,080
all I wanted was for one person to look

125
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:55,110
me in my eyes say hey kid are you okay I

126
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:58,410
am so grateful to be alive and I'm

127
00:04:55,110 --> 00:05:01,590
grateful today for every millisecond I

128
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:03,990
get to breathe cuz it was almost all

129
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:05,730
ripped from me by me what's one thing

130
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:10,740
you would have said to your younger self

131
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:13,980
to the Kevin who was 19 sitting on the

132
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:16,230
bus if you were next to you and instead

133
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:19,650
of the guy who pointed and laughed what

134
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:21,919
would you say I would just put my hand

135
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:21,919
on this

136
00:05:24,169 --> 00:05:32,560
I'll just put my hand on my shoulder and

137
00:05:27,349 --> 00:05:37,480
I would just say I'm here for you

138
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:40,240
I got you we need to be a society that

139
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:42,340
comes together for every person in the

140
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,690
community that's going to hell and in

141
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:45,880
order to do that every person that's

142
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:48,310
going through hell whatever hell has to

143
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,720
be honest about their pain and if

144
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:52,510
they're gonna be honest about their pain

145
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:54,490
we are going to collectively answer the

146
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:56,110
call and be there for that individual

147
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:58,660
because if you don't see beauty and the

148
00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:03,010
next person you meet you're not looking

149
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:06,870
hard enough you're incredible dude this

150
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:09,980
is not it's an honor for me to brother

151
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:09,980
[Music]

152
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:13,660
from this point on I want to make an

153
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,460
effort to contribute and immerse myself

154
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,750
in the conversation so I'm pledging to

155
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:19,150
donate 1 million dollars to various

156
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:21,250
suicide prevention organizations with

157
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:22,570
the first $250,000 going immediately to

158
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,580
the National Suicide Prevention lifeline

159
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:27,130
so they can increase their capacity to

160
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:29,169
help those in need for anyone watching I

161
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:32,440
want you to know you are not alone and

162
00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:34,360
most of the time crisis passes so if you

163
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:36,280
or anyone you know feels alone we're

164
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,080
trapped I encourage anyone to call or

165
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,669
even text a suicide or crisis hotline

166
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,930
both of those numbers over lo and

167
00:06:39,669 --> 00:06:43,150
although this is a tough conversation

168
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:45,070
it's important because things can and

169
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:46,510
will get better it's time to start a new

170
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:48,070
chapter in my life as I continue to

171
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:50,789
educate both myself and others on

172
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:54,660
suicide I'm humbled and thankful to say

173
00:06:50,789 --> 00:06:54,660
this is just the beginning
