the logo that symbolizes the word

maverick which is what I preach is

260
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:26,430
people who don't follow the path of

261
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,440
others it's the black sheep in the group

262
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:30,660
the ones who don't live in the bubble

263
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:32,400
that on society tries to place on people

264
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,990
people who don't follow the rules road

265
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,400
