1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:05,400
the number one question we're getting is

2
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:06,540
how do i watch the fight how do i buy

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,580

nothing more so here we go okay guys

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,139
first things first couple things you

7
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:19,020
need to know one this is the biggest

8
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:21,449
internet event in history but and it

9
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,670
costs ten bucks to watch literally two

10
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:27,779
cups of coffee trust me this is a moment

11
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:30,929
not one to make Wow

12
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:33,210
as far as watching the stream you cannot

13
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:34,410
watch it unless you purchase and watch

14
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,020
it we're gonna have hundreds of

15
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,820
employees removing any pirate extremism

16
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,559

17
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,270
jig when did you buy the flights watch

18
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,469

20
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:46,500
gotta you out of my tech knowledge

21
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:49,170
that's it so there's actually two places

22
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,840
you can buy and watch the flight one is

23
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,309
on YouTube and if the stream on YouTube

24
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,170
is not available in your country the

25
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:57,059
other one is a website called UK both of

26
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:00,449
