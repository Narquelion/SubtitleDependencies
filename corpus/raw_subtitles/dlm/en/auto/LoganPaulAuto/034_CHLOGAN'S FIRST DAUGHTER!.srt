103
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:17,909
looking these first couple days might be

104
00:07:16,499 --> 00:07:19,919
a little stressful for the pig I

105
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:30,840
remember when I got calling it was

106
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:32,129
pretty bad at first okay first thing you

107
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,680
got to do when you get a pet right get

108
00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:36,330
pet supplies it's the most fun part it

109
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,680
really is we're gonna get maybe like an

110
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:39,419
outfit or something I'm thinking like a

111
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,729
sheriff's outfit well dude no one's

112
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:44,129
gonna expect us to be walking around

113
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:46,949
with the pig in encino watch out in the

114
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:48,900
car she was just cuddling with me and

115
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:51,029
now she knows that I'm I represent

116
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,710
safety for her and warmth and health and

117
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:53,729

118
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:56,270
parent at this point in their

119
00:07:53,729 --> 00:07:56,270
