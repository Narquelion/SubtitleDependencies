under the waterfall you guys remember I

226
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:28,890
went under waterfall in Hawaii one

00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:30,120
fourth of this one yeah another fact

228
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:32,940
that was in Hawaii

229
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:34,830

diamond it's looks right I don't know if

232
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:39,570
it's gonna happen but I'm saying it's an

233
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,830
idea okay see it has been planted the

234
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:44,970
idea

236
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:49,940
good question

237
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:52,740
thoughts on going under the waterfall I

238
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:54,750
mean we would be crushed by the fooling

239
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:56,070
water and our rain Jackson I'm just

240
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:58,710
saying bro everyone's going to the top

241
00:12:56,070 --> 00:13:02,250
it'd be a real maverick move to not do

242
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:03,150
that I say we check it out miner Huck

243
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,860
