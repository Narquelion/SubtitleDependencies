and I spent the last two hours fixing

8
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,610
this bowl with a 3d pen over alpha can

9
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,140
identify how the bowl actually broke

10
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,600
yeah that's actually the worst part I

11
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:40,309
was the one who broke it as well I'm

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,309
kind of just trying to stay busy over

13
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:59,789
board bro it works just great all right

14
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,530
so I'm not too happy right now

15
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:03,180
y'all may have seen I've been fed on are

16
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,739
a little bit like painting and stuff and

17
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,210
this morning I woke up to find that a

18
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:07,350
piece of art in my house had actually

19
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:09,030
been vandalized it looked like it was

20
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,799
done with stencil and a spray-paint I

21
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,299
said Banksy wasn't here obviously my

22
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,010
first thought was cool banks he came to

23
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:15,810
my house to vandalize my art but then I

24
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,189
was like this it's most likely not

25
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,560
actually Banksy so I checked the

26
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:21,990
security cameras and at 1:24 a.m. you

27
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,460
can see a tall skinny man entering frame

28
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,979
with his face covered putting his

29
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:28,110
stencil up and ruining my masterpiece

30
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:30,299
and the worst part is I'm pretty sure I

31
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,950
know who did it I just don't know why I

32
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:35,820
know you vandalized my painting you

33
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:38,250
piece of [ __ ] it's just crazy because

34
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,200
that stencil art resembles a lot of your

35
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:42,150
art too let's propose that it was back

36
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,310
see it wasn't [ __ ] Banksy you've

37
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:47,520
analyzed my art that wasn't me if you

38
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:49,470
can prove that I did it retribution huh

39
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,689

40
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:53,310

41
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:56,189
Mac is trying to not walk like that

58
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:35,580

59
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,930
to destroy my image yes my art is
