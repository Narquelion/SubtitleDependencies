never pulled a trailer in my life this

82
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:21,259
this trip is kind of a fingers crossed

83
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:23,380
operation my bag is sitting in the

84
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:25,400
middle of parking lot I'm moving that

85
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:29,750
literally all this stuff is just easy

86
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:31,460
accident this is actually there's a

87
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:36,139
method to my madness I have something I

88
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:37,820
want new there's water in Yosemite so we

89
00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:47,539
knew we needed a kayak now the only

90
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:59,090
issue is getting it on top of the cool

91
00:04:47,539 --> 00:05:05,090
bus alright one more step alright just

92
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:07,240
throw it to me okay Andy maybe help him

93
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:07,240
out

94
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:15,990
what perfect are you sure this is gonna

95
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:17,760
work no I'm not sure of anything on this

96
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:19,530
trip guys by the way you don't have any

97
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,120
plans literally I've never been to

98
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:22,710
Yosemite none of us have you'll have a

99
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,000
campground so we're just gonna kind of

100
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:25,950
wing it no service there so we're not

101
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,940
gonna have GPS or able to text people

102
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,290
and honestly I don't even know if these

103
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,490
vlogs are gonna be able to be uploaded

104
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:31,170
so I guess if you're watching this

105
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:33,120
that's a good sign we're still a lot hey

106
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:34,650
this looks pretty stable I'm thinking

107
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,120
because we're like five hours later so

108
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:37,140
we're gonna miss out of the daylight in

109
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,180
