Justin Bieber hosted me on his Instagram

00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,349
his main feed I'm not gonna lie this is

14
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,029
probably one of the coolest things to

15
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:31,349
happen in my life ever justin is coming

16
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:32,790

17
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:34,890

00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:57,719
pronounced the zone Daz end there's an

31
00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:59,579
app you could download this app it's

32
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,590
like the Netflix for live sports I was

33
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:03,660
actually a subscriber on to zone before

34
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,400
I became a fighter on to zone and they

35
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,320
bought my fights and for some reason I'm

36
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,549
still paying the monthly subscription I

37
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,560
can't believe I don't have a discount

38
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:14,000
there's no in tagline big fights any

39
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,590
device one price yeah that's right a

40
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
super user friendly app very easy to

41
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:19,920
sign up I'm gonna walk you through it

42
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,110
although again like it's really [ __ ]

43
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,520
easy you can go to the zone calm or go

44
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:25,140
to the App Store and type into zone

45
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,180
Daz and I'm not gonna lie it's pretty

46
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,500
self-explanatory you sign up it's very

47
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,509
easy you can get the monthly

48
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,890
subscription or the annual subscription

49
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:34,170
if you like to watch flights a lot which

50
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,479
I do the monthly subscription is $19.99

51
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,460
now that's too much money for you go mow

52
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,079
lawn or something but look you got 20

53
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,640
bucks like ask a friend ask parents like

54
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,619
collect change from under the laundromat

55
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,630
behind $20 you can buy this fight last

56
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:46,799
year it was $10 this year I feel the

57
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,149
value of the fights a little more it's

58
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,590
gonna be a lot more entertaining and I

59
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:51,030
want to say the last fight was heavily

60
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,799
heavily pirated so this is gonna be the

61
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,540
