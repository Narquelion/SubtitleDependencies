1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:07,440
it's not right to do murder okay so this

2
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:09,510
morning I get a text with my brother

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,030
little brother Jake Paul everyday bro

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:14,400
I'm sure you know him anyways he says yo

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,890
I say yo classic brother convo and then

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,859
from left-field he comes at me with some

7
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,990
series he said I'm making you the

8
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:23,250
beneficiary of my life insurance policy

9
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,760
so here's the thing I didn't graduate

10
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:29,640
college guys so I say what's that he

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:32,279
said it's like if I die who gets my

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,930
money to split it up and I will say the

13
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,180
it though was with the capital i dot

14
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,100
capital T Apple you're on some weird

15
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,960
autocorrect right now I'm an ideas man

16
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,480
guys sprockets in my brain start firing

17
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,969
this could be a good cash play for me so

18
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,730
just to clarify I said so dot if you die

19
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:49,860
die die I get to decide how your money

20
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:52,590
is split up he says I guess it's kind of

21
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:55,110
confusing but I think okay so then I go

22
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,730
I put meanwhile in the back of my brain

23
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:58,170
I'm like yo christmas is coming up I

24
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,879
want to buy my dad a mom a nice gift

25
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,140
that could use a little extra cash right

26
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:02,730
Jake me said a lot of money he's like a

27
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,070
multi-millionaire so I thought about

28
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:07,229
what any logical rational human being

29
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:09,770
with a brain would think I I do have to

30
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:09,770
kill my brother

31
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,450
