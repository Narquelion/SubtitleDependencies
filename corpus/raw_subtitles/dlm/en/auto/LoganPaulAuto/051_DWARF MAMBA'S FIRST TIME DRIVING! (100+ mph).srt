space costume anyone he puts it on his

66
00:03:41,349 --> 00:03:45,190
carpet he feels like he's in space cuz

67
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:48,690
the carpet is fluffy and it gives him

68
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:48,690
like the perception of being on the moon

69
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,060
he's genuinely in space anyways yeah oh

70
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:06,159
