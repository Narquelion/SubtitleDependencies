00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,049
with you maverick what yeah

36
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:26,970
because you can fly cuz you're a bird

37
00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:29,250
because Kong can't fly cuz he's a dog

38
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:31,920
but I was thinking what if Kong could

39
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,390
fly yeah because you could give him your

40
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,710
powers I know I'm just kidding you can't

41
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,630
do that it's impossible All Right see

42
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:38,400
you later but what if I built Kong

43
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,110
something that could allow him to fly

44
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,700
would you like that puppy do you want

45
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,079
