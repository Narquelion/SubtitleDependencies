the low gain came across the street this

61
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,870
across the way those of you who don't

62
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,220
know that is actually the reason I got

63
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:28,960
kicked out of this building because I

64
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:30,790
lived right there and the low gang would

65
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,320
like 40 people every day would just

66
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:33,910
stand on top of that parking garage and

67
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,520

77
00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:31,130
cannons are frickin dangerous bro

78
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,690
you leave them out which I don't think

79
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:34,370
you're supposed to do this is the psi

80
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:36,139
chamber and I think the co2 like leaks

81
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:37,550
into it basically it has a mind of its

82
00:04:36,139 --> 00:05:18,380
own and like you could just pull the

83
00:04:37,550 --> 00:05:21,979

182
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,920
why this is like this is a big deal I

183
00:09:28,779 --> 00:09:35,589
can't believe we're the only ones

184
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:42,750
talking about it bro

185
00:09:35,589 --> 00:09:46,480
it might be too much ok so then he peed

186
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:48,730
he has both mature he has his friend

187
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,100
come over and the friend boots on just

188
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:52,810
like a swing and the Maverick hat and a

189
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,790
maverick sweatshirt and they go out in

190
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:56,500
public and for summary this guy has like

191
00:09:54,790 --> 00:10:02,230
a beard and like black hair for some

192
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:06,519
reason everyone thinks that it's me how

193
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:08,680
is this working oh you know this is

194
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:09,970
hilarious alright that worked ok I don't

195
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,620
wanna make this like a reaction video

196
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:13,449
but I just have to address this cuz this

197
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:16,180
could literally like shatter YouTube my

198
00:10:13,449 --> 00:10:18,699
cameras bouncing again you little high

199
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:20,260
the bell rings every time little game

200
00:10:18,699 --> 00:10:23,220
for life but yeah it's up to Logan if

201
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:23,220
heroes me haven't hit this

202
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:44,230

203
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:48,519
name out of his mouth I'm gonna punch

204
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:50,259
your head after you to snake this stuff

205
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:51,100
we can make a district honey we're gonna

206
00:10:50,259 --> 00:10:52,509
be rich

207
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,429
that's what they'll be saying okay

208
00:10:52,509 --> 00:10:55,809
here's the gist huh I'm just gonna keep

209
00:10:54,429 --> 00:10:57,939
this camera angle right here how like

210
00:10:55,809 --> 00:10:59,800
this dramatic effect if I sneak this

211
00:10:57,939 --> 00:11:01,899
right this is not gonna be on purpose if

212
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,879
I sneak this rice I feel like that's a

213
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:06,399
bomb drops on YouTube this is gonna be

214
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:06,759
an interesting mix cold air okay low

215
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,439
gain

216
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:09,910
let's go watch this fight we're headed

217
00:11:08,439 --> 00:11:11,439
right next door to George's house but

218
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:13,389
right here I have one out of the 50

219

221
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:17,820
happens you are you in the low game oh

222
00:11:16,569 --> 00:11:20,929

223
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:20,929
[Music]

224
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:31,710
[Music]

225
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:41,460
[Applause]

226
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:25,500
am i bad amigo no Conor McGregor forgot

227
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,790
I'm aware that at this point in my vlog

228
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,380
it probably looks like I'm rooting for

229
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:34,930
McGregor I just want to make it what you

230
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:37,420
are no no no no I know I'm not well I'm

231
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:38,529
not next I am indifferent to who wins I

232
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,670
just want to see a good fight here's

233
00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:42,519
what I think is gonna happen

234
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:43,660
Mayweather is gonna win for sure no

235
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:45,940
here's why here's why here's why he

236
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:48,130
gregor is it there's both world-class

237
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:50,260
athletes both worked incredibly hard but

238
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:52,660
McGregor obviously is not a boxer right

239
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:55,540
he's stepping into the boxing ring with

240
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:57,279
the best boxer of all time yet level is

241
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:59,529
just too high for me to go with McGregor

242
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,149
how if McGregor pulls this off I think

243
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:02,889
he will go down in history as one of the

244
00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:05,010
best fighters of all time agree or

245
00:13:02,889 --> 00:13:05,010
disagree

246
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:11,410

step outside of his comfort zone and go

265
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:10,550
