93
00:05:52,699 --> 00:05:59,989
area for I know this and I found out

94
00:05:54,829 --> 00:06:02,689
that I'm allergic to tagging it's a

95
00:05:59,989 --> 00:06:07,549

00:06:14,899 --> 00:06:26,749
balls yeah yeah Rommel is two balls but

100
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:28,789
I guess yeah we could go oh that's the

101
00:06:26,749 --> 00:06:31,519
reason you clicked on this vlog there's

102
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:32,899
some more drama brewing on you know what

103
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:35,839
you know why people like drama I think

104
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:37,639
everyone especially like in LA people on

105
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:40,129
YouTube everyone Instagram whatever is

106
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:41,509
so fake and social media definitely

107
00:06:40,129 --> 00:06:43,399
doesn't help with that because it can

108
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:44,989
just heighten people's perceptions of

109
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:47,029
who they think you are quick example

110
00:06:44,989 --> 00:06:48,889
when I walk around in public I'm not

111
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:52,069
like screaming at people but in the

112
00:06:48,889 --> 00:06:54,949
vlogs I but the thing about drama is it

113
00:06:52,069 --> 00:06:56,689
makes people real it's it's a raw form

114
00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:59,029
of entertainment that people just love

115
00:06:56,689 --> 00:07:01,129
watch another quick example on August

116
00:06:59,029 --> 00:07:03,829
25th I'm fighting that I'm beating up

117
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:04,969
that British kid I am gosh darn positive

118
00:07:03,829 --> 00:07:06,259
that it's going to be the biggest

119
00:07:04,969 --> 00:07:08,089
internet event in history just cuz

120
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:12,409
people like seeing people fight and have

121
00:07:08,089 --> 00:07:14,419
drama into it with the Klout gang who

122
00:07:12,409 --> 00:07:15,949
which by the way like it's you add three

123
00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:17,360
letters to low gang and it's clogging

124
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:19,050
I've always had like something so minor

125
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,090
be for that boy specifically this

126
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:25,680
dude Wolfie well I'm actually cool with

127
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:28,020

issue but yeah I remember what it was

139
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:56,849
thought that was weird I'm not the type

140
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,960
of person that like strays away from

00:07:56,849 --> 00:07:59,669
this stuff in person like on the

142
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,560
internet like yo that's cool whatever

143
00:07:59,669 --> 00:08:03,900
but like if you're gonna talk person

144
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,430

like that isn't it that's not that's not

151
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,020
how we grew up in Ohio it's like you

could talk all you want over the

153
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:19,289
internet but in real life if you're

154
00:08:17,219 --> 00:08:20,699
gonna act like a school it's not like
