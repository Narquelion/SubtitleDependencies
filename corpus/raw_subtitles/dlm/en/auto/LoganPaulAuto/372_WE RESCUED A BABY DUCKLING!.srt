for the duck sir are you a duck no it's

26
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,869
just a fish duck duck duck Duck Duck

27
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,070
grew up raising ducks I don't know what

28
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:30,329
we're gonna do with this one also the

29
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,619
fact that he's alone is kind of

30
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:33,210
worrisome I'm hopefully he has like a

31
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:35,189
sibling here somewhere doc if you're a

32
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,479
duck raise your hand you know I'm mating

33
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:39,770
call or something I could draw this for

34
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,770
a duck absolutely

35
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:48,330
I don't think it works well we got well

36
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:51,070
we have a very scared terrified

37
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:53,140
separated potentially orphaned duck oh

38
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:54,310
no we have to be realistic

39
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,380
no no reason why a duckling would be

40
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:58,720
separated as Eva the mother hasn't made

41
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:00,759
it or the mothers abandoned Hayden knows

42
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:02,740
his ducks might have a responsibility to

43
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:05,200
take care of the stock I've raised ducks

44
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:06,970
well yeah I have yeah yeah I grew up

45
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,619
with the most adorable things ever so

46
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:10,360
what does he need like right now I think

47
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:12,459
people really need some warmth some was

48
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,440
a height so we can calm down we need to

49
00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:18,340
get him some him or her some food sounds

50
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:19,510
like a plan chicken feet if you get

51
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:21,130
chicken feet of protein they can grow

52
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:23,230
really strong unless we want to make our

53
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:24,550
duck vegan well not liking food I think

54
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,930
it's what a chicken eat I'm gonna get

55
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:27,730
this duck some protein he gonna be too

56
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:33,700
gnarliest duck in the land we want this

57
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:35,530
dipole to be a bro bro our dog is an

58
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:40,900
animal he's a lion I'm actually gonna

59
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:46,180
take care of the dot no I know what how

60
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:49,060
many ducks you have Brooke yo why are

61
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:54,070
you in the merch store bro the hottest

62
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:55,780
softest much in the game oh my god we're

63
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:56,470
using the hottest softest nurse in the

64
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,360
game tomorrow

65
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:59,530
he's already calm down bro there's no

66
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:07,630
way of telling if it's a male or female

67
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:10,180
you have a false look for his dick dicks

68
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:14,709
hide inside that body oh my god hey

69
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:16,450
that's a dick duck okay so now we're

70
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:17,890
back in real time we have to figure out

71
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:19,299
what to do with the duck which by the

72
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:20,970
way bro I know I said I wanted to name

73
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:24,640
him duck though but I got a better idea

74
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:26,620
what if we named him Huck dude Huck the

75
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,530
duck bro cuz he's looking sitting on the

76
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:35,600
hockey t-shirts befo

77
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:37,670
it's Huck the dock is so perfect no

78
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,050
because it's the ship's yeah so look

79
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:40,850
until I guess we figure out what we

80
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:42,080
actually want to do next we have to take

81
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:43,430
care of this duck so I think we're going

82
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:51,190
to go to the store and get some duck

83
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:56,900
stuff to take care of hook what yeah

84
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:58,520
wait what what do you know dad first of

85
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,080
all you can't just eat a duck a baby

86
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:08,930
duck especially you need the eggs maybe

87
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:10,880
second of all Jesus dad not eating the

88
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:12,200

92
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:24,800

94
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,730
dad is a SMAW might be the most

95
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,540
counterproductive conversation I've ever

96
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:31,850
had in my life

97
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:33,800
Nick GP yeah great stuff I did try to

98
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:38,180
eat the duck and told us he needed food

99
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:39,890
thanks dad alright guys so I'm about to

100
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:41,870
become a dad for the first time that I

101
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:43,190
know I'm early er I did call someone who

102
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:44,660
knows a little bit more about this stuff

103
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:46,190
and like if it's legal or like what to

104
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,870
do and how to do it he's calling me back

105
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:50,030
right now his name is Jed he's a good

106
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:52,490
dude brother talk to me bro I'm glad you

107
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:54,140
reached out we we contacted our people

108
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:55,730
from the city and the state your

109
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:57,620
inclination was correct we wanted to

110
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:59,270
make sure that we followed all the right

111
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:10,880
steps to make sure we protected this

112
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:13,760
takling in the state of California ducks

113
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,920
and hawks are protected by a federal

114
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:18,140
reserve and what that means is that you

115
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:23,150
have to have a federal rehabilitation

116
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:25,010
license to keep and presumably heal up

117
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:26,900
baby huh claims he spent a great time

118
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:29,810
with you but here's the bottom line he

119
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:31,360
has to go as soon as possible to the

120
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:34,270
West Valley Animal Shelter

121
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,889
which is our local shelter and I mean

122
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:37,180
it's a bummer but it's it's the best

123
00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:39,220
thing for him it's the most humane thing

124
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,599
for him and it's the law and you want to

125
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:42,819
make sure that we do all of those things

126
00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:46,659

better

162
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:50,980
well maybe probably more responsible for

163
00:08:48,009 --> 00:08:52,089
sure yeah yeah bro yeah well they said

164
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,410
they're gonna take him to a first to

165
00:08:52,089 --> 00:08:54,759
rehab center because he's been doing

166
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:56,019
like drugs or something they said and

167
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:58,120
then they're gonna get him accustomed to

168
00:08:56,019 --> 00:09:00,279
the wildlife and then too sure about the

169
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,319
drugs they said rehab center as he needs

170
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:03,370
to

171
00:09:01,319 --> 00:09:04,930
well they said a rehab center so he

172
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:06,639
