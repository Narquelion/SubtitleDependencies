138
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:24,770
the hesitancy everyone in the house has

139
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:28,190
you know I achieved everything that I

140
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:30,650

141
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:38,420

186
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:04,050
sure he's not heartbroken at the end of

187
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:06,810
this you still giving him an amazing

188
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:09,840
inspirational talk and it's just right

189
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:11,520
now we made a music pick them up yeah he

190
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:13,290
gets to write it down later and go to

191
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:15,240
school as University and be like here's

192
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:20,100
my social media project my little

193
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:22,330
brother at this point right it would

194
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:26,470
have worked out

195
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:29,620
I don't know what US law is as far as

196
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:32,680
minor traveling from Europe here but 15

197
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:34,060
years old I don't think it's legitimate

198
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,860
that nobody stopped them and asked that

199
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:37,720
question I don't want the parents to say

200
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,970
hey he kidnapped our son yes I don't

201
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,740
know he lured her son from Poland to

202
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:43,720
come there I mean they can say anything

203
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:45,430
anybody can say anything the truth is

204
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:47,890
the truth the kids got a set of balls on

205
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:49,600
him I gotta say like he he's gutsy well

206
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:51,430
he's got a dream and he's following that

207
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,800
dream here's the big question how much

208
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:55,540
time do we have before he is potentially

209
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,340
removed from the United States he's

210
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:59,470

211
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:03,460
couple hours we got like a day I don't
