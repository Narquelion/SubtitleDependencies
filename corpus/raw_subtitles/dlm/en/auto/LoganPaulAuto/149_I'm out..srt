told myself I was gonna go easy and I

88
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:22,090
didn't can you imagine having to go to

89
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:23,470
the sidelines and tell your coach who

90
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:25,390
happens to be 2 Chainz

91
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:27,640
that's you're the one guy that pulled a

92
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:29,830

99
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,880
I did it

100
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:52,750

my German videographer David this was

103
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:06,790
odd this was way odd and then I think

104
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,980
like three days later Heron Sybil she

105
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:11,320
posted on her Instagram story ten signs

106
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:13,810
of maturity and oddly and ironically

107
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:15,940
enough number nine was you sometimes

108
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:18,250
prefer to be silent than to engage in a

109
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:20,769
nonsense fight slightly hypocritical but

110
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:22,030
