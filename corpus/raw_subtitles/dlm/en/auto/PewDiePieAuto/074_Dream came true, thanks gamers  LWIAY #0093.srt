00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,520
Minecraft the whole way and then my

187
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,750
laptop I didn't have my charger it was

188
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,300
the worst day of my life

189
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:18,390

190
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:21,510
meatball it was like finally I can't

191
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:23,130

276
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:39,839

279
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:48,750
of wool when it thunders it could burn

280
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:51,300
down wool easily burns and IKEA power is

281
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:54,930
very tall so we construct easily do you

282
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:57,389
think a mayor lightning struck will take

283
00:13:54,930 --> 00:14:00,510
down the most glorious creation of all

284
00:13:57,389 --> 00:14:02,399
time after meatball number 2 IKEA tower

285
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:04,230
will rise and there's nothing you can do

286
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,560
to stop it I assume whoever wrote this
