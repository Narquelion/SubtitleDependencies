get it we all named our pee pee at one

32
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,040
point in my life but not when you're old

33
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:36,780
okay that's unforgivable this guy's to

34
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,130

35
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,130
together seven non-virgins

36
00:01:41,329 --> 00:01:46,950
alright I'll just be blind this episode

37
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:52,009
it's fine I don't is a virgin I am NOT a

38
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:54,560
virgin I am NOT I am NOT a virgin

39
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:56,299
goddamnit everytime when I watch these I

40
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,430
cuz I think I'm good at gauging people

41
00:01:56,299 --> 00:02:00,560
every time when they do that I'm not I'm

42
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:02,689
like I should be able to pick you up but

43
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,850
I can't it's too hard a liar

44
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:06,590
if the group discovers who the liar is

45
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:09,170
they'll split a cash prize

46
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:11,750
if the liar survives he or she wins the

47
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:13,489
entire prize but if you win that means

48
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:17,540
you're virgin so do you really win

49
00:02:13,489 --> 00:02:19,190
somebody to think about I say we just

50
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,709
start asking questions and everyone

51
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:25,130
answers that's a pretty good strategy I

52
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:28,549
like that that's that point out there

53
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:30,079
shop god I think that's why the Cubs are

54
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:31,160
so savage because it's so easy to just

55
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:32,510
sit here and we're like that's the

56
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,190
dumbest [ __ ] I've ever heard

57
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:35,780
no what we really should do is we don't

58
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:37,489
we should all just have sex right here

59
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:39,799
because that means everyone won't be a

60
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:42,110
virgin and we all win the money easy

61
00:02:39,799 --> 00:02:44,510

62
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:46,489

63
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:48,160

67
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:58,459
talkative let's go around the circle

68
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,560
figure it out yeah everyone that's a

69
00:02:58,459 --> 00:03:02,780
virgin cannot be confident whatsoever

70
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:10,269

71
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:10,269

109
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:36,750
School both virgins didn't know what the

110
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:40,220
hell we were doing it was the first

111
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:40,220
letter of her first exact correct J

112
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:49,050
bloom at 21 would that mean that makes

113
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,760
no sense

114
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:52,500
all right I was late bloomer - I

115
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:54,810
wouldn't pull some 21 she was my

116
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,090
coworker so kind of scandalous what

117
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:59,909
about you

118
00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:04,979
her name was harmony and how'd you guys

119
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:07,680
meet my space my space you next there

120
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:10,919
was harmony we met on myspace where were

121
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,260
widely in love harmony you next sounds

122
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:15,840
almost as realist Demon Slayer 64 in me

123
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:16,860
but okay I was 14 it will last about two

124
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:21,400
minutes

125
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:24,670
so it sounds like a great exchange how

126
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:28,390
was your first experience two minutes I

127
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:30,520
mean it's probably accurate loss to a

128
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:33,340
girl named Stacy Stacy and in back of my

129
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:35,590

132
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:43,210

I believe was my it was my apartment

136
00:06:53,310 --> 00:07:00,760
very suspicious and this is already a

137
00:06:55,990 --> 00:07:10,740
big red flag how many people have you

138
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:32,680

00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:37,090
know see this hickey a guy here yeah

142
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:45,760
that's whatever I had sex last night

143
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:49,330
I'm 25 25 old med I had a thousand girls

144
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:59,350
harmony harmony one harmony to harmony

145
00:07:49,330 --> 00:08:01,480
three it was great hickeys were cool

146
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:02,560
when you were you were a teenager you're

147
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:05,110
25 dude

148
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,680
Jesus Christ you get a hickey when

149
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:12,450
you're not a teenager he punched right

150
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:12,450
away thrown out the window right away

151
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:23,560
because he was playing the game so hard

152
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:26,020
I was like hey she suck with her lip she

153
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:28,660
did come to win to the point of giving

154
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:38,200
himself a fake hickey

155
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:46,060
relationship few months I don't know I

156
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:47,950
don't know anything I just like figured

157
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:52,840
that maybe get rid of the guy with the

158
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:55,180
pony t-shirt I mean yeah to be fair

159
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:57,190
TV I also I don't think it is that him

160
00:08:55,180 --> 00:09:03,370
because it's never the obvious one in

161
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:06,370
these I've learned that much at least if

162
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:08,650
it's obvious we have to yeah it's also

163
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:10,630
fair I can see though I'm kind of

164
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:13,240
flattered I didn't want to be too

165
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:14,440
defensive no I'm not I'm not a virgin

166
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,040
just because I'm kind of like it's okay

167
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,560
if you are

168
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:23,380
what oh absolutely unless you're married

169
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:25,680
of course you guys have had sex like an

170
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:31,260
obstacle course on my college campus

171
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:34,300
like one of those rope course things an

172
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:36,100
obstacle course how does that happen I

173
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,780
feel like I have too many points to make

174
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:40,090
in this video it's just so weird what

175
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:43,660
everyone says obstacle course

176
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:45,610
hey girls see that obstacles you see

177
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:47,710
that obstacle course over there I bet we

178
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:49,150
could slam it out in the obstacle course

179
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:50,860
how does that happen

180
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:54,360
guess if we don't have anywhere else

181
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:54,360
let's hit the obstacle course

182
00:09:54,930 --> 00:10:00,070
she's definitely saying and I actually

183
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:03,930
don't think he is as well but I would

184
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:03,930
still vote him out just for the shirt

185
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:14,470
you should try the obstacle course yeah

186
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:16,780
Jonathan is a hive mentality you just

187
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:21,040
want to be safe and do whatever it takes

188
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:22,680
yeah see

189
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:27,250
[Music]

190
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:29,770
damn everyone I had a different shirt I

191
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:32,770
was told that this shirt worked fine I

192
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:35,470
feel like that may have contributed also

193
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:37,510
maybe don't judge people by the shirts

194
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:43,000
that they choose to bro you had another

195
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:45,130
shirt and you wore that one wait

196
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Jubilees said it was fine to wear it too

197
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:48,250
really

198
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,050
hey I have this house a shirt that says

199
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:51,760
I'm a virgin on it is that is that

200
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,900
cooler I got another one I could change

201
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,840
it no that's fine

202
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:56,530
keep that shirt that's fine if it isn't

203
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,540
Jonathan

204
00:10:56,530 --> 00:11:01,510
boy oh boy will I have learned a lesson

205
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:03,760
today about not judging people by their

206
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:05,590
shirt they wear whatsoever most favorite

207
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:13,750
aspect of sex what you guys like the

208
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:14,470
most about sex I liked it that's my

209
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,480
favorite part

210
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:22,420
I'm not a virgin by the way my favorite

211
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:24,160
part of sex is day that's my that's my

212
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:28,180
favorite part because I have sex I

213
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:31,590
totally had sex my favorite part is that

214
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:33,640
[Music]

215
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:55,720
that's what I know that's just my

216
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:57,790
preference definitely not a virgin I

217
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:00,240
suspect the flower boy and how long have

218
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:02,560
you been with your wavering six months

219
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,290
how long were you singing before that oh

220
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,270
I had another boyfriend from the movie

221
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:09,430
theater but we broke up those new

222
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:09,910
boyfriend and then I had a one-night

223
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:13,990
stand

224
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:18,220
that was three okay I mean that's

225
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:20,820
actually believable statistically if we

226
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:24,400
eliminated her we'd make more money

227
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:28,150
type time at that what what what he did

228
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:30,610
say so he just confirmed that he doesn't

229
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:33,990
think it's her but he wants to eliminate

230
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:33,990
her to make more

231
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:41,260
this guy is either the best actor and a

232
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:43,920
virgin or he's just a douche bag I can't

233
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:45,340
wait to read the comments goddammit I

234
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,860
there it is

235
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:49,840
statistically if we limited her we'd win

236
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:53,590
more money didn't find the virgin but

237
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:56,080
the douche is very I mean he's not wrong

238
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:57,580
why I heard though that's so mean

239
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:04,090
yeah you had sex the least amount of

240
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:06,190
time you gotta go yeah you don't know

241
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:08,560
come on I rather be in a relationship

242
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:20,410
than just have sex with anyone just

243
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:22,840
bullying now oh wow she took her toe she

244
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:25,870
did the whole arm thing like you you

245
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:31,350
like you like look at that I notice

246
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:31,350
issue oh good for you but you're going

247
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:47,170
cuz she was the most introverted does he

248
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:49,060
know what the point you're supposed to

249
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:52,330
find the March ahead god I hope he

250
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:56,610
doesn't lean still there good luck yeah

251
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:58,360
it's their discontent in the group I

252
00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:01,360
think it's one of the black out

253
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:08,410
understand they always pick the ones

254
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:10,540
that you don't think it is she like you

255
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:12,760
said three in the last two weeks but so

256
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:15,670
I went to Palm Springs two weeks ago and

257
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:18,010
then two days ago I had sex with someone

258
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:19,300
so I did team we just kind of like

259
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:22,810
looked at each other we're just like

260
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:24,400
okay we kind of knew that we were safe I

261
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:27,340
think he could potentially still be the

262
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:29,710
more all right to ask questions were you

263
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:31,300
religious to before you had sex yeah

264
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:33,310
so if I called your mom right now and I

265
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,900
was like he's had sex a few times she

266
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:38,620
probably already thinks I do I mean I've

267
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:40,610
never told her do that no one in their

268
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:42,799
right mind would do that

269
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:46,269
yeah back of the Volvo what color was a

270
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:49,339
Volvo by the way it was gold gold damn

271
00:14:46,269 --> 00:14:50,569
alright as far as the Volvo did you have

272
00:14:49,339 --> 00:14:57,410
like padding in there or was it just

273
00:14:50,569 --> 00:15:11,540
like what was the but was the body part

274
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:13,519
that hurt most after you finished my

275
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:15,079
vote is on fire flower guy in the guy's

276
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:19,670
house that were out and his parents were

277
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:22,639
gone usually 30 to 70 18 yeah yep

278
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:26,029
the MAV seems off every damn no she said

279
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:28,160
70 so she had a new guy that means

280
00:15:26,029 --> 00:15:31,009
statistically she had a new guy every 20

281
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,899
days since 14th

282
00:15:31,009 --> 00:15:40,939
I'm not shaming but that's a lot a into

283
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:43,100
now that's up there I don't think it's

284
00:15:40,939 --> 00:15:45,199
anything like that but she could be

285
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:47,239
coming in here trying to be like I'm the

286
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:49,999
coolest she's saying a big number she's

287
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:51,499
young therefore I believe it because if

288
00:15:49,999 --> 00:15:53,419
she was coming in here as a mole she

289
00:15:51,499 --> 00:15:55,040
really know the guy that comes the

290
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:57,230
person that came in to say think they're

291
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:00,589
the coolest is definitely this guy I'm

292
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:03,559
all she I think she's safe and that

293
00:16:00,589 --> 00:16:07,819
global story about your knees that that

294
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:18,860
makes sense I'm a sex symbol okay well

295
00:16:07,819 --> 00:16:21,199
he's good needed to like sway one of

296
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:22,699
them so I was thinking like Trevor was

297
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:25,009
the mole okay we'll just go with a

298
00:16:22,699 --> 00:16:26,929
manual for now but he wasn't budging I

299
00:16:25,009 --> 00:16:30,829
don't think he has a beard with like a

300
00:16:26,929 --> 00:16:32,209
tattoo he didn't throw me in the fire

301
00:16:30,829 --> 00:16:33,470
it's kind of like you know what you're

302
00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:35,209
cool you know throw me and me and

303
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:37,160
Emanuel started kind of indirectly

304
00:16:35,209 --> 00:16:38,689
teaming up to like telepathically if you

305
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,829
think so do you think no other point of

306
00:16:38,689 --> 00:16:41,209
the game at this point or have they just

307
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:43,129
forgotten it seems like they're just

308
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:44,929
trying to bully each other they throw

309
00:16:43,129 --> 00:16:46,819
out the girl because she was the most

310
00:16:44,929 --> 00:16:49,220
introverted and then they team up

311
00:16:46,819 --> 00:16:51,919
because they didn't throw it they don't

312
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:53,410
like a tactic game of not being the

313
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:55,179
virgin

314
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:56,949
he bought the Hickey was a point like a

315
00:16:55,179 --> 00:17:05,259
bottle cap you just put on his neck

316
00:16:56,949 --> 00:17:07,089
bottle cap how does that work oh that's

317
00:17:05,259 --> 00:17:08,949
really everybody's you know it's not

318
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:10,000
hard to recreate that I thought it was

319
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:15,339
real but I thought it was a little

320
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:26,139
scripted I know it's not you yeah those

321
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:27,789
numbers did they work they work do I got

322
00:17:26,139 --> 00:17:33,279
a hickey did it work

323
00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:56,259
can't see all right who's going out no

324
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:57,940
matter what it would have been - V - it

325
00:17:56,259 --> 00:17:59,710
was obvious that Sean and Jolie we're

326
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:08,409
gonna vote Trevor off and then try and

327
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:23,799
get me off yeah I think the mole is

328
00:18:08,409 --> 00:18:38,080
probably out but I want money so here we

329
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:39,370
go oh my god boy I'm so glad he didn't

330
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,679
once I'm so happy

331
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:44,440
people don't expect me to be a virgin

332
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:46,659
and unless asked I don't say anything I

333
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,820
get it it's the game survival of the

334
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:51,750
fittest so I I understand yeah the game

335
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:56,559
that no one played properly associate

336
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:58,580
self-proclaimed sex symbol no you are

337
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:00,769
you're the socio bad

338
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:02,179
you really never know so I'm still a

339
00:19:00,769 --> 00:19:04,460
virgin because I'm waiting for marriage

340
00:19:02,179 --> 00:19:07,640
all right fair enough

341
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:09,740
sex is a covenant between me God and my

342
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:12,110
future wife all right well well playing

343
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:14,059
well that promise to myself and my

344
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:23,149
family and to God that I would wait

345
00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:24,919
until marriage knowing as he was at

346
00:19:23,149 --> 00:19:26,750
least it was that was a good episode I

347
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:28,580
enjoy that now let's read all the

348
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:31,070
comments that is what kind of bully him

349
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:33,049
imagine being 25 thinking it's cool to

350
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:38,809
flex hickeys yeah pretty much

351
00:19:33,049 --> 00:19:40,639
Sean looks like that's not a version of

352
00:19:38,809 --> 00:19:42,350
someone that you want to be damn they

353
00:19:40,639 --> 00:19:45,139
really kicked Emily out just because she

354
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:46,580
was the most wholesome it I felt kind of

355
00:19:45,139 --> 00:19:48,289
good that she got voted out when she

356
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:50,149
started saying something about hi mind

357
00:19:48,289 --> 00:19:53,000
mentally I really felt disgusted with

358
00:19:50,149 --> 00:19:59,630
her what I'm just happy Sean or Julie

359
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:01,399
did say Jonathan and a manual yeah I

360
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:01,730
wished it don't stay longer on that was

361
00:20:01,399 --> 00:20:03,919
funny

362
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:05,510
honestly it would have been like Sean

363
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,220
