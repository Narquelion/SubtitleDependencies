that I will refuse to accept ever to be

45
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:01,110
a thing we should have just thrown it

46
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,270
out right away

47
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:05,610
what makes the world beautiful is the

48
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:07,439
fact that we can not steal from cultures

49
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:09,840
but appreciate other cultures and even

50
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,500
me then what's the problem we're one

51
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,840
nation

oh but historically whites would take

53
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,540
part yeah but that's

54
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:19,459

55
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:21,349
ok just remember for every boomer that

56
00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:23,299

00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:31,400
about not generalizing and judging but

60
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:32,959
you I don't know what movie this is

61
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,480
Florida abortion bill would require a

62
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:39,799
judge to rule if teens mature enough to

63
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:42,920

flu vaccines aren't really a thing here

75
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:07,340
in Europe I don't think you have to get

76
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:09,500
vaccinated for every flu that seems kind

77
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:11,150
of stupid to be honest separating from

78
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,829

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:16,070
it has autism found a job opening that

127
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:18,770
requires for eight plus years of Swift

128
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:21,230
experience Swift is programming language

129
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:23,300
that kima three years ago this is the

130
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:25,880
equivalent of me you need their job to

131
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:28,250
have work experience but you need

132
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:30,200
experience to have job that's exactly

133
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:32,840
what I meant to say the world's richest

134
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:35,750
country came up with just 22 million to

135
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:40,880
fight the Amazon fires Stewart little

136
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:43,700
little budget 103 billion oh yeah

137
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:47,450
what was the return of that oh yeah now

138
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:49,070
that's an investment in the 1980s AMW

139
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:51,320
tried to compete with my there with a

140
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:54,290
McDonald's quarter pounder by selling a

141
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:55,880
third pound burger at a lower cost the

142
00:05:54,290 --> 00:06:01,280
product failed because most customers

143
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:07,670
thought 1/4 pan was bigger but the

144
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:11,630
number is lower bigger brain it's hard

145
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:14,090
oh that's so funny someone should make a

146
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:16,280
fifth pound burger or I can give you a

147
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:19,130
tenth pound burger that's a lot of

148
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:21,650
burger kids these days have it a lot

149
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:23,510
easier than we did growing up that's the

150
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:28,010
goal though right isn't that the point

151
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:30,500
is the Boomer scenario just summarized

152
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:33,470
beautifully how dare these kids have it

153
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:35,690
easier a guy says he was questioned on a

154
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:37,280
plane for doing math during a flight a

155
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:38,810
woman sitting next to the Ivy League

156
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,510
economist told a flight crew

157
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:45,110
she had security concerns about them man

158
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:47,419
Oh God face palming begins after seeing

159
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:51,320
him right in a foreign script it turned

160
00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:55,300
out to be differential equation it must

161
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:58,400
be some sort of terrorist language Oh

162
00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:06,650
security imagine just glancing over at

163
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:12,470
your flights just calm down and tell

164
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:19,010
security if your social security number

165
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:23,030
was the amount of money you had Oh God

166
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:24,950

167
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:28,760
can't be real though are people that

168
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:31,100

00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:11,539
plastic was wrapped in plastic oh that's

186
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:13,490
gonna hurt so hard I know they rap books

187
00:08:11,539 --> 00:08:16,070
just to make sure people don't read in

188
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:19,370
them but that's kind of unusual to do

189
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:21,320
choose wisely Apple Proust and one plus

190
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:23,360
sixty Nintendo switch for games Amazon

191
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,280
fire a year of Netflix if you buy the

192
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,110
Apple Proust and I can guarantee you

193
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,720
that you already have these things right

194
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:32,240
it doesn't really make any sense like it

195
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,770
is a luxury product clearly that does

196
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,900
not mean it's for everyone

197
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:37,909
I'm face-palming about this for the

198
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:39,620
wrong reason call the restaurant to make

199
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:41,960
a reservation but couldn't think of the

200
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:43,520
word so I asked for a food appointment

201
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:48,110
and now I can never show my face there

202
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:50,690
again I feel like I can't relate to this

203
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,440
so many times when I make a call I just

204
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,550
never know

205
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,750
I never prepare what I'm

206
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:56,480
about to saying as soon as I'm there

207
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:57,980
like I need to put appointment yeah I

208
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,640
could see this happening gosh that's

209
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,880

00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:22,339
it doesn't mean anything but it's such a

218
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:24,410
dumb example of like trying to make kids
