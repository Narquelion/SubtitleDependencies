- bad kids are vegan they use cornstarch

128
00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:03,300
- as a bonding agent which is great but

129
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,759
that was my point that every candy ever

130
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:08,280
uses gelatin and it's like why you can

131
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,889

00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:07,880
with people making content is always

262
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:09,620
drama and topical stuff so it's fun to

263
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:12,200
just do your own thing every once in a

264
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:15,140
while if people is a person yeah yeah

265
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:17,360

00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:19,400
beekeeper actually explaining no we

267
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,950
