wonder why do I have this ugly wall here

97
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:36,190
well I wanted to try out if I could

98
00:04:33,729 --> 00:04:40,630
build like a hidden door the thing is

99
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:43,210
like because now when I ah that when I

100
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:45,729
ride out with your again smart again it

101
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:47,680
doesn't work it doesn't work I couldn't

102
00:04:45,729 --> 00:04:50,229
make it the war we like no they're just

103
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:53,289
they're too small for your again so I

104
00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:55,570
want to make like an like a piston door

105
00:04:53,289 --> 00:04:57,849
I think because Pistons are fun get away

106
00:04:55,570 --> 00:05:01,240
from here some so when me and uragan got

107
00:04:57,849 --> 00:05:03,849
an adventure we hit button door open and

108
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,770
we go out and it's epic fun time okay

109
00:05:03,849 --> 00:05:07,930
let's do that I don't know how to do

110
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:10,210
that let's figure it out right Sven

111
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:12,400
let's use our peepee poo-poo brain okay

112
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:14,680
okay so first what we have to do is we

113
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,570
have to cook a steak I need I know I

114
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:19,719
have okay I have three sticky pistons I

115
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:22,230
think I might need more I need these and

116
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:24,990
I need a lever probably a new axe

117
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:28,650
I don't mind my anvil broke I'm so low

118
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:31,350
on steel fine you know what fine this I

119
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:34,320
have a lot of diamonds okay I think I

120
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:36,600
think I can spare to make an axe what

121
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,200
level am i 27 I'm freakin rich

122
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,090
freaky

123
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,800
all right and chaunt min time what do we

124
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:44,760
get what did we get what do we get

125
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,470
efficiency 3 ok I guess I'll take it

126
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:48,870
dude can we talk about how I'm fully

127
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:50,580
diamond can we talk about that you guys

128
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:53,760
want to talk about that I'm gonna talk

129
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:55,830
about how rich I am why don't I have so

130
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:58,170
much diamond no steel because how will

131
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,740
this work let's test it out on neutral

132
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:00,750
ground

133
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,160
I don't know how sticky piston work but

134
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:05,610
I think what they can do is they hold

135
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,020
they hold the block that it's listen I'm

136
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:08,990
a Minecraft veteran I think I know

137
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:12,930
better than you so don't even

138
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:14,610
Stevens Mead and how does this work does

139
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:19,430
it come back it comes back that's epic

140
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:22,080

142
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:28,140

because when I went all across the sad

236
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:34,959
I discovered a jungle I know I never

237
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:39,040
went like inside it but it's time to go

238
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:44,259

leash I need to bring a leash there's so

242
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,970
many things you need to think about in

243
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:53,350
Minecraft at least if you care about

244
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:56,889
your animals it becomes a whole

245
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:59,230
different aspect of the game because you

246
00:11:56,889 --> 00:12:00,610
can't go without really glad I spent

247
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:03,759
half the episode trying to build a

248
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:05,920
freaking redstone it's fun I like it

249
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:08,589
look it's cool

250
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,869
I think it's cool I wish I was better at

251
00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:13,299
hiring the hiding the wiring and stuff

252
00:12:10,869 --> 00:12:15,549

253
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:17,350
know Sven is with us sorry I wish this

254
00:12:15,549 --> 00:12:18,670
wind could go on the horse on the air

255
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:20,199
again that'd be so cute all right well

256
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:23,019
this is a good time for me to shout out

257
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:24,879

258
00:12:23,019 --> 00:12:28,239

00:12:30,939 --> 00:12:33,160
same time all right what else could you

262
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:36,549
want in life

263
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:39,040

00:12:51,129 --> 00:12:53,889
bucket a lot of people have been saying

271
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,509
that you can actually put the ender

272
00:12:53,889 --> 00:12:59,889
dragon in a bucket and a lot of people

273
00:12:55,509 --> 00:13:01,209
