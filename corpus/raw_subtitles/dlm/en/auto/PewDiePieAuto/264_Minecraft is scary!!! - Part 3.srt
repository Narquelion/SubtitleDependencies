stigma against digging straight down but

play Minecraft oh I hear the lava what

134
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:41,050

thought that I was pure panic but I

163
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,870
actually managed to go to the surface so

164
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:39,370
I think I didn't actually lose my items

165
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:40,960
pray to knotch and gaben's baby Oh God

careful when you play video game you

179
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:14,320

180
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:17,140
