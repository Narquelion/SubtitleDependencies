00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:56,520
Aeneas rock extrusive mafic extrusive

441
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:59,460
igneous rock form from the rapid cooling

442
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:02,100
of magnesium rich in the iron-rich lava

443
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:04,140

make a basalt generator that's so cool

447
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:15,390
so it's basically like a new form of

448
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:18,929
stone block and they form because lava

449
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:21,750
fall cools in this area I guess it's

450
00:23:18,929 --> 00:23:24,030
cooler that's why the the fire has a

451
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:27,539
