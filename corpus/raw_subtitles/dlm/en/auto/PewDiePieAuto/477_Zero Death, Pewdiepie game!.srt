18
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:41,820
this is where I've been working for 14

19
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,890
days because you uh you made me make a

20
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,300
game for you so it's all your fault okay

21
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,149
I feel like you're putting a little bit

22
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,590
too much of me there okay you so for

23
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:50,250
those who you don't know maybe you

24
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:53,640
should explain

25
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:57,420
so I dared PewDiePie to dare me to make

26
00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:00,870
a game in 14 days for him and so he said

27
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:04,019
yes in the latest lie yes that's right

28
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:07,409
and then I was like oh crap I actually

29
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:09,600

30
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:12,330

the best it was literally probably the

42
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:42,409
best idea for the game they wanted to

43
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:52,979

artwork was done by gamers for good

57
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:44,810

58
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:47,450

there we go here's the 3:19 chair

183
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:13,899
perform an epic 399 smash attack just

184
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:16,610
hold down while jumping and attacking

185
00:09:13,899 --> 00:09:18,740
who knows might help you get you the

186
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:28,930
meme cemetery so what what side what is

187
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:30,829
a hold poke down while I go oh yeah yeah

188
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:33,769
that's awesome

189
00:09:30,829 --> 00:09:34,850
we know of course of Coriana you do that

190
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:48,620
your spirits up

191
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:53,829
yeah this is our I had no idea what I

192
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:56,360
was talking this is a great voice

193
00:09:53,829 --> 00:10:01,120
reverberating that's our word that I use

194
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:01,120
in my mind actually not strong

195
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:11,280
they took a step into the meme cemetery

196
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:16,620
oh god oh god Thomas no you like it dark

197
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:18,240
but this is just too much okay things

198
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:24,900
you got to start getting intense Felix

199
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:27,150
oh oh oh don't you worry about it

200
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:29,490
I figured the barrels were a good place

201
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:31,740
to be in like in the meme cemetery of

202
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:32,460
course and you got a nut goes where he

203
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,410
belongs

204
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:35,850
yeah so it was really tough figuring out

205
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:37,970
which needs to include in the mean

206
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:41,700
cemetery because I mean there's like

207
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:43,650
hundreds of thousands and so we sort of

208
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:46,110
everyone in that I raised yeah they want

209
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:50,660
everything we they sort of voted on them

210
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:53,730
on the subreddit now of course nice oh

211
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:56,010
it's so it's such a bizarre experience

212
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:59,250
playing a game like based on you but

213
00:10:56,010 --> 00:11:00,090
it's so sure you're gonna knuckles a

214
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:04,230
tombstone

215
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:07,770
you got a knuckles for January 2018 died

216
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:10,890
July 2018 cause of death unknown

217
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:13,410
okay sure hahaha oh god they're flying

218
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:15,770
now rest in peace you've gotten enough

219
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:15,770
goals

220
00:11:16,529 --> 00:11:29,129
Oh God it is getting intense you're not

221
00:11:19,589 --> 00:11:32,159
joking hey is there another button to

222
00:11:29,129 --> 00:11:35,849
punish instead of miles no and I've had

223
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:37,609
requests for that but I figured I think

224
00:11:35,849 --> 00:11:41,969
maybe you'll get used to it

225
00:11:37,609 --> 00:11:43,709
okay I feel like but okay but by the way

226
00:11:41,969 --> 00:11:46,499
you see you jump in space for you some

227
00:11:43,709 --> 00:11:48,329
loot yeah okay you got it you jump with

228
00:11:46,499 --> 00:11:51,659
space and maybe I need to change it yeah

anytime you see a missile Felix you can

288
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:38,840
do that air attack and it won't hurt you

289
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:38,840

having three hands to play this game

300
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:18,890

301
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:20,660
three hands you have to realize hey this

302
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:24,220
is why I should stress test games

303
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:28,940
because I play like all the idiots I

304
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:31,839

monetization points now get in that

376
00:20:20,379 --> 00:20:27,479
rocket at a crisis arranger oh yeah I

377
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:32,649
like how are you in the rocket is

378
00:20:27,479 --> 00:20:35,940
silently already I was lonely now 300

379
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:39,849
days aboard that cold and grant rocket

380
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:40,089
felt like a lifetime supply for running

381
00:20:39,849 --> 00:20:43,359
there

382
00:20:40,089 --> 00:20:47,349
I was scared I was very sad I would

383
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:57,700
hungry I was even tempted to eat one of

384
00:20:47,349 --> 00:21:00,519
my leg whoa I love it beware psychotics

385
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:02,919
psychotic nine-year-olds memory loyalty

386
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:08,469
to fugitive peopie has led to psychosis

387
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:10,670
and self-mutilation of the legs wait a

388
00:21:08,469 --> 00:21:13,850
minute

389
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:20,330
my god the nine-year-old they don't have

390
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:22,760
legs what do you think oh my god are

391
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:25,100
those cows what is happening back there

392
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:27,650
tell us what is happening right there so

393
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:29,210
part of the reason dude why the nine

394
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:30,950
year olds don't have legs I mean

395
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:33,530
obviously it's a story telling it but

396
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:34,970
the main reason is because I was running

397
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:38,690
really low on time

398
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:40,810
hahaha and so animating legs is like one

399
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:43,760
of the hardest things to do oh really

400
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:45,770
for me at least like your character well

401
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,470
it took forever to animate it looks like

402
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:50,150
the running say nice but I didn't want

403
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:56,120
to have to do it for the 9 year olds

404
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:59,150
like it is it's so should I go to the

405
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:01,280
right first or should I go up here did

406
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:03,080
you talk to the rover no I'll do that

407
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:07,160
then go talk yeah go talk to the robot

408
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:14,150
can can you please get me my bleep bleep

409
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:16,520
oh battery's about this yeah what was

410
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:17,900
cool about this is I I had no idea what

411
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,400
I wanted to do I just knew I needed to

412
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,970
block the player from getting to the

413
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,310
right of the screen

414
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:24,500
ah so you're on your audience said hey

415
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:29,480

416
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:32,300
to it to block it put the Tesla oh oh

417
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:36,080
yeah and so it crash-landed into Mars

418
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:37,880
because it's that whatever Oh the

419
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:41,300
