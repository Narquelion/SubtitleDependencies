careful don't quiet

22
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:03,809
I'm just cautiously optimistic to always

23
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,670
aim for the head yeah we know you know

24
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:09,200
that we're totally when I did something

25
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,200

27
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,330

29
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:24,310

32
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:34,710

33
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:37,940
things to save our friends

34
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:37,940
to protect our home

35
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,810

36
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:50,710

it's never go alone hmm

42
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:14,390
interesting very interesting I wonder

43
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,000
what it's like to grow up in a world

44
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:23,209
that so many bad things are just normal

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,980
that it's sort of because you have other

46
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:27,830
people with their definition of bad and

47
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:33,430
good but you've grown up in this nature

48
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:33,430
that it's obviously so different

49
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,249
[Music]

50
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:46,290

220
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,319
little harder for myself because I'm

221
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:28,569

00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:32,279

225
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:43,850
remember way back in the day I did a

226
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:48,950
promo with Walking Dead and I got to do

227
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:49,910
the official Walker makeup so they put

228
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:52,070
me like this

229
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:54,470
ask the one they used for this show it

230
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:59,840
was really cool that's basically how I

231
00:16:54,470 --> 00:17:02,590
look like exactly like that and they

232
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:05,990
told me that each Walker on the show

233
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:08,449
tries to do their signet signature

234
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:10,310
Walker move or whatever it looks like

235
00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:10,910
I'm making fun of something that's not

236
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:14,020
anybody

237
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:16,430

238
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:18,410
alright you know what screw it I don't

239
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:22,000
know where it goes I should just stop

240
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:22,000
talking walkers in the other direction

241
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:31,970
I saw his eyes when he did it my point

242
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:33,410
was they wanted to be recognized on the

243
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:36,940
show even though they're Walker's which

244
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:36,940
i thought was kind of cute go

245
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:42,450
also props to everyone for getting that

246
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:45,180

247
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:53,940
hours to get on and then an hour to

248
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:57,210

00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:10,190

253
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:13,140

than just survival like what rule 1

435
00:29:56,299 --> 00:30:03,190
never go along the very first rule is

436
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,190
about how to survive

God kids are so complicated the shores

525
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:27,420
that way school is probably that way

526
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,830
you're just gonna head back to the

527
00:36:32,589 --> 00:36:34,830
school

528
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:52,650
a sim was the third huh the day after AJ

529
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:57,390
killed Marwan you already know viola and

530
00:36:52,650 --> 00:37:00,720
I vote for you to stay a sim was a third

531
00:36:57,390 --> 00:37:03,920
vote wait that means Omar voted us out

532
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:08,460
and a ruby uh yeah

533
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:11,130
damn huh what made you think of that a

534
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:12,570
sim said you knew how to survive he

535
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:16,740
could just tell the school would be

536
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:17,940
safer with you there I voted for you

537
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:23,760
because I liked you

538
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:26,400
but his reason it was better I just I

539
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:31,980
just thought you should know the sim was

540
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:36,810
right we were who we were more scared

541
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:38,640
than we let on when you met us oh he

542
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:40,020
meant that you were safer that's really

543
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:43,200
nice but he meant the opposite I was

544
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:44,970
like what ha ha it's not a character

545
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,450
that we're out of danger and climbing

546
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:51,660
back home you just made me think of it I

547
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:54,000
like assume if Marlon was still in

548
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:58,470
charge we'd be taken away to wherever or

549
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:00,960
dead instead we fought back because you

550
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:03,630
showed us how we weren't saved with

551
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:09,330
Marlon even in his safe zone

552
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:11,510
we were just hiding mm-hmm okay that's

553
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:15,750
great honey

554
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:19,250

555
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:19,250
it gonna be huh

556
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,130

559
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:44,680

00:38:54,790 --> 00:39:00,640
did everyone will come out damn right

562
00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:05,440
they took clementines back to the school

563
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:05,440
I'm here for the emotional look for us

564
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:10,180
never would have forgiven myself if I

565
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:10,180
didn't

566
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:24,020
it's over Clem the Raiders are gone and

567
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:25,550
we got everyone out alive Ruby said

568
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:26,300
violets eyes aren't affected so that's

569
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:29,230
good too

570
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:33,410
they'll all be waiting for us back home

571
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:35,420
any idea which way that is I haven't

572
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:40,510
been out travel but I think there's a

573
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:43,960
bridge no no houses way back let's go

574
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:49,070
mmm how about another way around huh

575
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:51,350
what's there not a safer way you imagine

576
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:53,780
if they didn't do me Sean and instead of

577
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:57,140
doing me Sean they do the same season

578
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:59,180
but with two vastly different arcs there

579
00:39:57,140 --> 00:40:01,430
you could go into how freaking cool

580
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:03,650
would that be that would literally shut

581
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:05,620
up all the criticism that these games

582
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:09,350
get about the choices not really matter

583
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:11,900
we can live without me Sean I mean why

584
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:14,450
do they me Sean broke me that's when I

585
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:17,030
realized it's just not as fun as it used

586
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:21,070
to be but he magically knew that I'd be

587
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:21,070
so cool back on the boat

588
00:40:27,229 --> 00:40:31,919
was that your first because you knowing

589
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:37,109
at the end of the season

590
00:40:31,919 --> 00:40:40,969
yeah two or three it feels you get to

591
00:40:37,109 --> 00:40:40,969
pick if you want to stay with Ken or not

592
00:40:41,179 --> 00:40:45,869
you have a tendency to beat yourself up

593
00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:47,459
Louis it would be cool to keep being

594
00:40:45,869 --> 00:40:50,219
able to keep playing with him right back

595
00:40:47,459 --> 00:40:50,789
or if you kill and we'll get a different

596
00:40:50,219 --> 00:40:53,819
story

597
00:40:50,789 --> 00:40:55,289
having a home means defending it that

598
00:40:53,819 --> 00:40:57,269
means you can stay with the characters

599
00:40:55,289 --> 00:40:59,039
that you enjoy or if you don't like you

600
00:40:57,269 --> 00:41:01,979
start alone you're gonna die on that

601
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:03,239
boat instead of constantly just

602
00:41:01,979 --> 00:41:05,999
resetting always goes through my head

603
00:41:03,239 --> 00:41:08,130
when that happens my old pet turtle Jeff

604
00:41:05,999 --> 00:41:09,539
my grandma's phone number the word that

605
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:12,539
lost me the fourth grade spelling bee

606
00:41:09,539 --> 00:41:14,400
recommend I hate when they fell Jeff

607
00:41:12,539 --> 00:41:17,630
would Joe sorry if that's your name

608
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:19,919
anything new it throws me up every time

609
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:22,829
before my parents divorced they were

610
00:41:19,919 --> 00:41:25,949

611
00:41:22,829 --> 00:41:28,469

01:26:48,850 --> 01:26:56,409
back at first I was ashamed so I

1033
01:26:54,100 --> 01:27:02,550
followed the river for a long time I'm

1034
01:26:56,409 --> 01:27:02,550
just thinking about Benny and yeah

1035
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:10,290
I found their bodies I saw what the

1036
01:27:06,270 --> 01:27:16,880
walkers did to them they were just bones

1037
01:27:10,290 --> 01:27:24,440
and stuff me that's really sad kind of

1038
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:32,100
kind of no I know it's sad now I just I

1039
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:35,910
wasn't sad then my god do you know what

1040
01:27:32,100 --> 01:27:36,360
night youth means no never taught me

1041
01:27:35,910 --> 01:27:38,820
that one

1042
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:40,890
do you remember that joint I made for

1043
01:27:38,820 --> 01:27:43,680
you the night Brody died with the house

1044
01:27:40,890 --> 01:27:46,680
and the walkers and my sisters and me I

1045
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:48,240
remember you said you sometimes drew

1046
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:51,560
your sisters like the walkers left them

1047
01:27:48,240 --> 01:27:56,820
instead we put it on the wall in a room

1048
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:58,980
you drew me in and Klem naive means you

1049
01:27:56,820 --> 01:28:01,850
think a certain way because you don't

1050
01:27:58,980 --> 01:28:01,850
know the way it really is

1051
01:28:04,250 --> 01:28:10,460
when I saw Minnie's body for real how

1052
01:28:07,470 --> 01:28:10,460
the walkers left her

1053
01:28:11,050 --> 01:28:18,489
I realized those drawings were stupid

1054
01:28:14,430 --> 01:28:21,730
that house will never be real I'll never

1055
01:28:18,489 --> 01:28:25,480
meet my sister's again the only thing

1056
01:28:21,730 --> 01:28:27,310
real is when we're alive I don't think I

1057
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:32,739
really know anything about the world AJ

1058
01:28:27,310 --> 01:28:36,000
I think you did ring them can can you

1059
01:28:32,739 --> 01:28:36,000
teach me to be like you instead

1060
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:42,420
the way I think just gets people in

1061
01:28:40,210 --> 01:28:42,420
trouble

1062
01:28:42,580 --> 01:28:51,760

01:38:18,110 --> 01:38:26,630
between my batch and your stump

1126
01:38:20,940 --> 01:38:26,630
we almost make a full pirate are I

1127
01:38:28,610 --> 01:38:36,389
wanted to wait till you were up and

1128
01:38:30,750 --> 01:38:39,389
about but how I behaved on the boat it

1129
01:38:36,389 --> 01:38:44,070
was really unfair my head Mercer messed

1130
01:38:39,389 --> 01:38:48,119
up by lily and Minnie I was so wrapped

1131
01:38:44,070 --> 01:38:50,670
up in my own [ __ ] it's okay he went

1132
01:38:48,119 --> 01:38:51,650
through hell in that boat and I let that

1133
01:38:50,670 --> 01:38:56,360
happen

1134
01:38:51,650 --> 01:38:56,360
I'm just glad we got you out of there

1135
01:39:03,880 --> 01:39:11,620

1136
01:39:07,450 --> 01:39:13,240
exhausted AJ no it's okay I kind of just

1137
01:39:11,620 --> 01:39:15,730
feel like playing a little after

1138
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:19,020
everything that's happened good you

1139
01:39:15,730 --> 01:39:19,020
could teach me how you draw so good

1140
01:39:27,680 --> 01:39:33,340
what are you drawing eyes

1141
01:39:31,570 --> 01:39:35,139
but they don't look like they do in my

1142
01:39:33,340 --> 01:39:38,230
head oh yeah

1143
01:39:35,139 --> 01:39:41,619
eyes are hard the ears are good I like

1144
01:39:38,230 --> 01:39:43,869
the yellow yeah but you couldn't tell

1145
01:39:41,619 --> 01:39:46,599
they were eyes when you're starting out

1146
01:39:43,869 --> 01:39:48,699
you don't have to get so detail just use

1147
01:39:46,599 --> 01:39:51,929
shapes like a circle inside a circle

1148
01:39:48,699 --> 01:39:51,929
works for the pupil

1149
01:39:59,789 --> 01:40:09,480
yeah you suck well I'm getting tired

1150
01:40:06,210 --> 01:40:15,650
kiddo mind talking with me before I turn

1151
01:40:09,480 --> 01:40:15,650
in sure

1152
01:40:38,530 --> 01:40:46,360
gotcha sorry it's okay I stare at it too

1153
01:40:43,890 --> 01:40:48,640
if it was just you and me alone out

1154
01:40:46,360 --> 01:40:52,180
there and I was like this I don't know

1155
01:40:48,640 --> 01:40:55,060
if I'd make it two weeks I'm gonna need

1156
01:40:52,180 --> 01:41:02,280
these to go anywhere and if we ever had

1157
01:40:55,060 --> 01:41:02,280
to run it wouldn't be pretty

1158
01:41:04,449 --> 01:41:13,710
you made it so we don't have to run Clem

1159
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:13,710
we're safe now yeah I guess we are

1160
01:41:18,770 --> 01:41:29,170
yeah oh this

1161
01:41:26,369 --> 01:41:31,750
it's worth it

1162
01:41:29,170 --> 01:41:34,570
all those times you would ask me if we'd

1163
01:41:31,750 --> 01:41:36,070
find a home all I could ever tell you

1164
01:41:34,570 --> 01:41:38,800
was we'll see

1165
01:41:36,070 --> 01:41:41,710
and your face would fall every single

1166
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:44,260
time it's better than saying yes and

1167
01:41:41,710 --> 01:41:47,830
lying to me and that's what I told

1168
01:41:44,260 --> 01:41:51,790
myself but you want to know something I

1169
01:41:47,830 --> 01:41:54,100
didn't tell you I never had a plan I

1170
01:41:51,790 --> 01:41:57,160
never knew where we were going I never

1171
01:41:54,100 --> 01:42:01,670
knew anything I just bought and fought

1172
01:41:57,160 --> 01:42:06,559
and fought and hoped you didn't notice

1173
01:42:01,670 --> 01:42:06,559
hope we'd find something before you did

1174
01:42:08,449 --> 01:42:12,320
did I do a good job

1175
01:42:15,989 --> 01:42:26,460
you tried really hard that's all that

1176
01:42:19,389 --> 01:42:26,460
matters right it's part of it a big part

1177
01:42:29,110 --> 01:42:34,699
when we were in the barn you didn't

1178
01:42:31,150 --> 01:42:37,480
listen to me and if you had

1179
01:42:34,699 --> 01:42:39,160
I'd be dead

1180
01:42:37,480 --> 01:42:43,120
I shouldn't have said you weren't ready

1181
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:44,940
back in the cave you showed me how wrong

1182
01:42:43,120 --> 01:42:47,560
I was

1183
01:42:44,940 --> 01:42:49,860
you'll have to be strong for the both of

1184
01:42:47,560 --> 01:42:49,860
us

1185
01:42:51,980 --> 01:42:58,969

1186
01:42:57,080 --> 01:43:02,980

you're welcome for everything

1188
01:43:17,330 --> 01:43:23,840
can we have a Star Wars ending where

1189
01:43:19,500 --> 01:43:23,840
everyone comes back just to dance

[Music]

1191
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:55,680
they're walking dead

1192
01:43:56,250 --> 01:44:07,560
what does it say still not been final

1193
01:44:02,820 --> 01:44:10,820
season is that all the developers doing

1194
01:44:07,560 --> 01:44:10,820
their signature that's really nice

1195
01:44:16,510 --> 01:44:21,330
the s-sean

1196
01:44:25,960 --> 01:44:29,860
okay okay in you go

1197
01:44:34,740 --> 01:44:41,260
we can now play okay

1198
01:44:39,179 --> 01:44:42,929
okay I'll just do that then I don't

1199
01:44:41,260 --> 01:44:47,030
really know let's explain how this works

1200
01:44:42,929 --> 01:44:52,039
but it still seems like magic

1201
01:44:47,030 --> 01:44:55,639
[Music]

1202
01:44:52,039 --> 01:44:55,639
and you complain

1203

[Music]

1204
01:45:10,110 --> 01:45:16,020
36% said AJ wasn't ready interesting

1205
01:45:16,059 --> 01:45:25,239
41% decided to add a skylight who cares

1206
01:45:21,780 --> 01:45:27,699
79% asked 80 to kill you

1207
01:45:25,239 --> 01:45:28,500
interesting I wasn't sure if that was

1208
01:45:27,699 --> 01:45:33,389
the right choice

1209
01:45:28,500 --> 01:45:35,829
it wasn't it all right

1210
01:45:33,389 --> 01:45:40,119
it's definitely the best episode of the

1211
01:45:35,829 --> 01:45:41,110
season and I did I feel satisfied with

1212
01:45:40,119 --> 01:45:44,349
that ending although it was very

1213
01:45:41,110 --> 01:45:46,809
nerve-wracking to say the least

1214
01:45:44,349 --> 01:45:50,079
again I really appreciate the people the

1215
01:45:46,809 --> 01:45:52,449
developers finishing this I'm not sure

1216
01:45:50,079 --> 01:45:54,750
exactly how that happened but I think

1217
01:45:52,449 --> 01:45:54,750
that's great

1218
01:45:55,530 --> 01:46:02,260
and I'm glad it's it had an ending a lot

1219
01:46:00,219 --> 01:46:03,179
of shows just don't seem to know when to

1220
01:46:02,260 --> 01:46:05,110
quit

1221
01:46:03,179 --> 01:46:06,070
obviously they don't have a choice I

1222
01:46:05,110 --> 01:46:07,780
don't know what I'm trying to say I'm

1223
01:46:06,070 --> 01:46:09,520
just like I'm glad he's wrapped up and

1224
01:46:07,780 --> 01:46:14,800
it was wrapped up nicely I'll have to

1225
01:46:09,520 --> 01:46:18,010
say that and it's it's sad looking back

1226
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:20,170
at how this started this series so long

1227
01:46:18,010 --> 01:46:23,980
ago look this is the oldest years we've

1228
01:46:20,170 --> 01:46:26,710
ever done on the on the channel and it

1229
01:46:23,980 --> 01:46:28,809
kind of ended almost with a resentment

1230
01:46:26,710 --> 01:46:31,090
for a while I was really like angry at

1231
01:46:28,809 --> 01:46:35,170
the game for becoming the way it's done

1232
01:46:31,090 --> 01:46:40,059
but I'm really glad how it ended I

1233
01:46:35,170 --> 01:46:43,059
thought I was great and I hope you guys

1234
01:46:40,059 --> 01:46:46,829
enjoyed this very long series if you

1235
01:46:43,059 --> 01:46:49,389
watch all the episodes props to you and

1236
01:46:46,829 --> 01:46:52,210
roll we'll move on to another series

1237
01:46:49,389 --> 01:46:55,440
hopefully in the future that's it for me

1238
01:46:52,210 --> 01:46:55,440
for now goodbye
