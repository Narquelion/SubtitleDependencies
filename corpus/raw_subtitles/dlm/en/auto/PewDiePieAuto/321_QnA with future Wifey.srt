hi this is from sweet bliss clearly a

80
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,720
fan of Sweden why did you move from

81
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:54,910
Sweden and have you ever thought about

82
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,220
moving back here why did we move minds

83
00:03:54,910 --> 00:04:00,400
yeah we wanted a place where we could

84
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:02,290
both speak and be independent because in

85
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,720
easily you would have to mean a means we

86
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:07,660
do not have to read news yeah so you can

87
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,670
seem like a pretty in between times and

88
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:11,290
middle ground basically but we really

89
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:13,160
cherished the time we had in Sweden

90
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:15,380
because that's what we got my and

91
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:18,470
yeah that's it was a humble beginnings

92
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:20,810
in Sweden that's what I think about

93
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:23,030
going back to Sweden yeah but I think if

94
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:26,390

95
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:27,980

wanted which is the time to focus on

127
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:04,610
