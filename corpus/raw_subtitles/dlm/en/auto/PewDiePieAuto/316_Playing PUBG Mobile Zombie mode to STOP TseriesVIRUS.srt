65
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,380
gameplay at all I hope I don't get any

66
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:14,730
text messages when I play this

67
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:17,549
I chose whether to add the audio just so

68
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:20,549
I can hear it and play good or it's

69
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:22,350
shitty through my speakers and I chose

70
00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:23,970
to chitti oh wait maybe I can connect

71
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:26,930
this or Bluetooth now I think about it I

72
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:30,419
don't think my computer has bluetooth

73
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:34,820
for the love of God I don't think this

74
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:37,320
map actually has any bad stuff in it so

75
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:39,479
fix the green oh okay sorry I thought

76
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,820
the green screen was good I may have

77
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:43,520
gotten the wrong idea

78
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:45,600
all right let's get that chicken dinner

79
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:55,289
yeah we're playing happy Willis that's

80
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:58,530
it leave it like bits okay I'm curious

81
00:04:55,289 --> 00:05:00,360
should I check like it's like I can look

82
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:03,180
at my phone but I can also look at the

83
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,800
screen it's really weird I don't know

84
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:07,710
where like where to look okay

85
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,260
Paradise Resort now it's been a while

90
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,289
computer

91
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:33,540
the audio is muted near the map that

92
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,890
makes sense

93
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:38,860

just do that where are they

593
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:15,700

594
00:55:13,870 --> 00:55:17,860
with the audio but then you guys can't

595
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:20,380
hear them and then I just sound insane

596
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:23,500
when I talk to random people I don't

597
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:25,210
know why like I'm using how I always

598
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:31,300
record but some reason audio doesn't

599
00:55:25,210 --> 00:55:37,150
want to show up in my computer oh look I

600
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:42,400

605
00:56:09,309 --> 00:56:19,609

00:56:12,499 --> 00:56:30,019
happened to my phone number restart the

607
00:56:19,609 --> 00:56:32,170

okay I'm restarting you can play with an

610
00:56:46,009 --> 00:56:54,079
emulator wouldn't I be cheating I didn't

611
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:57,199
think of it that's awesome it's actually

612
00:56:54,079 --> 00:57:00,019
a great idea just link the game with

613
00:56:57,199 --> 00:57:02,079
your social media I should probably do

614
00:57:00,019 --> 00:57:02,079
that

615
00:57:03,069 --> 00:57:13,910

1093
01:50:02,090 --> 01:50:08,000

enough yourself yeah I get that

1095
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:18,740
