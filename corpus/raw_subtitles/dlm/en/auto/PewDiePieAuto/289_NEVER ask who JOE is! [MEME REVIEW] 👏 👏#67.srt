it must have been like

116
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,600
and then he came back with the fourth

117
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,680
wall breaking thing

118
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,360
where he stared into the camera me in

entire class

123
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,639

126
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,880
why do everyone want chum gum so bad

127
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,960

how does that even work time travel

135
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,199
question mark the news host when their

136
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,800
video calls

137
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:34,720
are delayed what the first guy

138
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,400
to discover the nether portal must have

139
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,400
been like epic

140
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,240
when you rub your eyes a bit too much

141
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,680
this meme is too relatable it has too

142
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,600
many relatable points

143
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:48,800
uber driver me

144
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:52,720

the top of the titty me i'm so glad that

172
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,479
ad

173
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:02,160

college girl fails a test is there

179
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:14,240

and i kind of feel like

187
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,759
since we know that's going to be the

188
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000

189
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,400
