I can replicate it just like so

130
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:08,760
get an idea what they did okay so first

131
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:12,090
of all they increase the saturation by

132
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:13,830
like increase saturation and they blur

133
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:16,110
the background it looked like they

134
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:17,670
increase the white point as well and

135
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:21,020
then they did such a poor job of

136
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:24,570
cropping out her hair that it looks like

137
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:26,580
one entity of things and then for some

138
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:33,599
reason they didn't made the eyes and

139
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:37,289
nose massive yeah they lifted the nose

140
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:40,039
