I'll take it damn I'm the real I I hate

8
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:31,219
to let you guys down the reason I think

9
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:34,890
I'm so optimistic about time is that I

10
00:00:31,219 --> 00:00:36,809
want to have more time to stream and I

11
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:40,129
know oh okay I'll get all my stuff done

12
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:40,129
and then then we can get going

13
00:00:40,219 --> 00:00:43,890
but then that's just not the reality a

14
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:48,480

68
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:59,360
was thinking about the game yesterday

69
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,970
couldn't if they started off with a B

70
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,900
instead it could have been so much

71
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:06,830
better I wouldn't hate her immediately

72
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:09,020

yesterday

00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:49,840
I could have opened the door

261
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:08,210

can you imagine so you're gonna tell me

263
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:13,250
the real reason whether after you know I

264
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:15,620
did they want to kill a little boy

265
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:22,130
because he shaved his head I wasn't

266
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:27,200
alone so I broke it so why'd you do it

267
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:29,240
I don't know motion-tracking yeah

268
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,860
it means they wore the suits when they

00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:37,130
did the sex scene I don't know if that's

270
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:40,910

there's an otter pick in the set

388
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,900

399
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,970
Oh

400
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:24,570
damn we're completely out on them

401
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:36,700
I think it's the drawers that are so

402
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:40,150
annoying it's like a lot of times

403
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:42,630
there's nothing in them even I say that

404
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:42,630
and then this

405
00:32:55,570 --> 00:33:01,250
20:12 pewdiepie let's plays with no face

406
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:03,080
cam what is this damn I remember when it

407
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:06,080
was like frowned upon to have face cam

408
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:07,940
oh you just care about yourself

409
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,889
the gameplay should be more important

410
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:11,649
you're so eager centric that you have a

411
00:33:09,889 --> 00:33:13,940
face cam Wow

412
00:33:11,649 --> 00:33:16,610
it only face cam I only really started

413
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:20,620
because of horror stuff because people

414
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:22,880
wanted to see the reaction

415
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:27,039
it's kind of interesting how it changed

416
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:29,809
now it's like a standard for any game

417
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:33,470
but I do remember is generally frowned

418
00:33:29,809 --> 00:33:35,000
upon for people to have face cam for a

419
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:38,080
long time and then it just sort of

420
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,909
slowly changed people's ideas around it

421
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:43,700
now no one cares good for your cousin

422
00:33:40,909 --> 00:33:46,630
it's interesting things that upset

423
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,630
people in the fans

424
00:33:52,999 --> 00:34:12,619

she was starting

492
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:48,990
she saved dozens of people in waste no

493
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:51,030
one can explain she blew up trucks and

494
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:51,570
killed some soldiers not that hard to

495
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:56,540
explain

496
00:39:51,570 --> 00:40:08,730
have you read her writings skimmed some

497
00:39:56,540 --> 00:40:12,120
you'd benefit from it sure so why did

498
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:14,250
she get exiled from the group because

499
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:16,730

500
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:16,730

was gonna be friends but he shaved his

509
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:07,480

510
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:11,500
have the haircut

511
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:14,100

artists

606
00:51:07,609 --> 00:51:13,150
so when you feel free you should think

607
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:18,499
about how your body is getting ready for

608
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:21,380
only when they are very much history and

609
00:51:18,499 --> 00:51:32,690
that what in speech inspired her to kill

00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:45,140

611
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:47,359

right building but I've never been to

this part of it the bridge drops herself

668
00:58:27,130 --> 00:58:33,609
at the back of the building this is new

671
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:49,020
underneath where the odds an indoor pool

672
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:55,890
it's chilling the hot nine Oh

673
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:24,630
had to check my fears arena that's the

674
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:27,990
worst of it we got off lucky maybe it

675
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:30,270
wasn't luck maybe it was some wolves

676
00:59:27,990 --> 00:59:36,660
believe in God oh now the game makes

677
00:59:30,270 --> 00:59:39,060
sense there's jinns well I don't if I'm

678
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:41,000
gonna die I'm gonna die for me then what

679
00:59:39,060 --> 00:59:44,000
are you doing here

680
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:49,940
why didn't you come back for us

681
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:56,850
guilt what you don't owe us anything I

682
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:59,570
just wish I had this many dumbbells your

683
00:59:56,850 --> 00:59:59,570
name fan man

684
01:00:09,209 --> 01:00:18,130
there was a huge gym earlier that I

685
01:00:11,619 --> 01:00:22,869
missed oh listen I respect muscle gains

686
01:00:18,130 --> 01:00:26,369
on anyone but abacus doesn't it doesn't

687
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:26,369
look real that's the thing

688
01:00:35,829 --> 01:00:41,480
there's a game about shooting zombies

689
01:00:38,809 --> 01:00:42,950
and you care about religion yeah because

690
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:49,819
they're trying to make the game seem

691
01:00:42,950 --> 01:00:52,220
realistic oh yes I care I'm not some

692
01:00:49,819 --> 01:00:55,220
sort of like looking at enemy girls

693
01:00:52,220 --> 01:01:00,279
going where are her organs ah it's more

694
01:00:55,220 --> 01:01:03,579
like did this doesn't fit in my opinion

695
01:01:00,279 --> 01:01:05,720
like they made some character in

696
01:01:03,579 --> 01:01:07,220
uncharted 4 I don't remember her name

697
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:14,029
they made her really buff and it was

698
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:15,829
just kind of cool I got all my I don't

699
01:01:14,029 --> 01:01:17,410
mind I think it's a cool thing I was

700
01:01:15,829 --> 01:01:19,549
thinking it's the same thing with the

701
01:01:17,410 --> 01:01:21,319
pregnant lady that's probably the

702
01:01:19,549 --> 01:01:24,200
dumbest okay this is safe I'll look for

703
01:01:21,319 --> 01:01:25,849
it the pregnant lady going out in calm

704
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:28,819
mind has probably one of the dumbest

705
01:01:25,849 --> 01:01:33,650
thing in the game I feel like there's

706
01:01:28,819 --> 01:01:36,140
few people that can refute that even in

707
01:01:33,650 --> 01:01:37,670
a logical standpoint if you don't give a

708
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:40,670
[ __ ] about the baby for some whatever

709
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:45,799
reason you still have to carry that

710
01:01:40,670 --> 01:01:48,380
[ __ ] thing around for nine months

711
01:01:45,799 --> 01:01:50,599
just just from that perspective it's

712
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:52,940
like why would you risk all doing having

713
01:01:50,599 --> 01:01:56,299
to do all that again unless you really

714
01:01:52,940 --> 01:02:02,750
really really don't care and that's this

715
01:01:56,299 --> 01:02:03,950
being generous with the argument but

716
01:02:02,750 --> 01:02:05,930
then I was thinking like it could be

717
01:02:03,950 --> 01:02:08,480
cool to have a really badass pregnant

718
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:09,710
lady it is a zombie apocalypse after all

719
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:11,359
like what if there was a lady that had

720
01:02:09,710 --> 01:02:13,460
to pretend to be pregnant we met her in

721
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:15,259
the woods she was forced to defend

722
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:16,970
herself that could be like oh yeah okay

723
01:02:15,259 --> 01:02:20,809
I'm praying the lady she's badass she's

724
01:02:16,970 --> 01:02:23,660
going out because she had to you know

725
01:02:20,809 --> 01:02:25,250
that's the difference here's this

726
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:30,589
someone that choose to do it and it's

727
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:32,119
just so cringy so I feel like a lot of

728
01:02:30,589 --> 01:02:33,950
ideas in this game they're not bad

729
01:02:32,119 --> 01:02:36,500
itself this is how they do them it just

730
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:38,329
makes me like that just seems too

731
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:39,910
obvious that the developer have some

732

01:43:32,350 --> 01:43:36,360
lower floors yet would they have what I

1093
01:43:35,410 --> 01:43:41,610
need

1094
01:43:36,360 --> 01:43:44,640
yeah probably but it's rough down there

1095
01:43:41,610 --> 01:43:46,060
she seems like a genuinely good person

1096
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:51,130
feel better

1097
01:43:46,060 --> 01:43:54,280
Ellie kill her so horrific elite you get

1098
01:43:51,130 --> 01:44:02,880
caught I had nothing to do with this of

1099
01:43:54,280 --> 01:44:08,170
course come on compartments Angela

01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:13,570
[ __ ] yeah always lucky he's a doctor

1101
01:44:08,170 --> 01:44:14,920
I'll do it okay fine she was so [ __ ]

1102
01:44:13,570 --> 01:44:17,850
up after I said talk to her

1103
01:44:14,920 --> 01:44:20,950
I really just smack it since Mac

oh I like this part where the game you

1107
01:44:32,920 --> 01:44:39,570
just walk really so it's my favorite

1108
01:44:37,390 --> 01:44:39,570
bits

1109
01:44:40,320 --> 01:44:46,780

on I don't want to be here all day fine

1114
01:44:56,040 --> 01:45:07,719
thanks I guess what they were going for

1115
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:09,670
is that and you're okay they knew where

1116
01:45:07,719 --> 01:45:12,070
you would hate Abby but then you they

1117
01:45:09,670 --> 01:45:13,659
wanted to change your mind

1118
01:45:12,070 --> 01:45:14,980
step by step so you would realize

1119
01:45:13,659 --> 01:45:16,060
yourself hey there's different

1120
01:45:14,980 --> 01:45:18,940
perspectives and then different

1121
01:45:16,060 --> 01:45:24,909
parallels of one person's enemy is

1122
01:45:18,940 --> 01:45:30,010
another person bing-bong you know he's

1123
01:45:24,909 --> 01:45:35,040
been I just feel like I've done the

1124
01:45:30,010 --> 01:45:35,040
trick for me I feel so bad for Mel yeah

1125
01:45:42,379 --> 01:45:47,070
for anything a lot of the details that

1126
01:45:45,359 --> 01:45:51,239
you have found out about Abby was just

1127
01:45:47,070 --> 01:45:53,849
like the trauma center and a few

1128
01:45:51,239 --> 01:45:55,979
surgical suites it sounds perfect

1129
01:45:53,849 --> 01:45:58,530
there's a reason we haven't touch this

1130
01:45:55,979 --> 01:45:59,359
area yet it was ground zero for the

1131
01:45:58,530 --> 01:46:01,469
whole city

1132
01:45:59,359 --> 01:46:03,749
they brought the first infected before

1133
01:46:01,469 --> 01:46:05,809
anyone knew better it's gonna be

1134
01:46:03,749 --> 01:46:10,109
overgrown - [ __ ]

1135
01:46:05,809 --> 01:46:11,609
awesome to be fair like it would have

1136
01:46:10,109 --> 01:46:13,019
been better to start off with Abby but

1137
01:46:11,609 --> 01:46:14,309
at the same time if they did that you

1138
01:46:13,019 --> 01:46:16,019
would have just been like why the [ __ ]

1139
01:46:14,309 --> 01:46:26,129
am i playing is Abby no matter what it's

1140
01:46:16,019 --> 01:46:35,749
like one hooker my bling is happy why am

1141
01:46:26,129 --> 01:46:38,609
i looting worst case look for ambulances

1142
01:46:35,749 --> 01:46:40,139
they're contained and I've gotten lucky

1143
01:46:38,609 --> 01:46:40,919
before yeah we played a baby for like

1144
01:46:40,139 --> 01:46:43,079
ten minutes

1145
01:46:40,919 --> 01:46:44,219
the point was they could have changed

1146
01:46:43,079 --> 01:46:47,899
the order of things and he might have

1147
01:46:44,219 --> 01:46:47,899
been more impactful

1148
01:46:50,620 --> 01:47:00,130

their life to their body

1157
01:48:01,570 --> 01:48:10,990

02:01:16,820 --> 02:01:19,809
that before we upgrade

1259
02:01:21,429 --> 02:01:28,870

right off this way

1467
02:28:42,471 --> 02:28:52,251
I leave now I go I don't go

1468
02:28:49,690 --> 02:28:55,190
so someone said that this is a pretty

1469
02:28:52,251 --> 02:29:06,891
true recreation of their aquarium in

1470
02:28:55,190 --> 02:29:16,521
Seattle which is kind of cool y'all need

1471
02:29:06,891 --> 02:29:19,131
to stop why doesn't want to go to Santa

1472
02:29:16,521 --> 02:29:21,621
Barbara she's worried about her mom

1473
02:29:19,131 --> 02:29:22,150
about what'll happen to her because of

1474
02:29:21,621 --> 02:29:25,341
us

1475
02:29:22,150 --> 02:29:32,331
shitty was a lifetime he needs to focus

1476
02:29:25,341 --> 02:29:35,961
on his own safety right now what could

1477
02:29:32,331 --> 02:29:38,381
happen to her sometimes parents are held

1478
02:29:35,961 --> 02:29:41,150
responsible for their children's sins

1479
02:29:38,381 --> 02:29:42,730
but I'm home is so devout not come

1480
02:29:41,150 --> 02:29:46,280
she'll probably be fine

1481
02:29:42,730 --> 02:29:48,881
are there still permission for helping

1482
02:29:46,280 --> 02:29:52,551
her he can't convince her to leave

1483
02:29:48,881 --> 02:29:59,351
no one could I'm more worried of what

1484
02:29:52,551 --> 02:30:03,860
she did to him love I'm sorry love

1485
02:29:59,351 --> 02:30:07,161
you know I wonder if he saw this he

1486
02:30:03,860 --> 02:30:10,030
loves sharks love sharks but hates the

1487
02:30:07,161 --> 02:30:13,671
ocean though he really opened up to you

1488
02:30:10,030 --> 02:30:17,921
we've bonded over her shared for me

1489
02:30:13,671 --> 02:30:17,921
dying you hear that love

1490
02:30:27,540 --> 02:30:33,790

1492
02:30:33,790 --> 02:30:38,620
to play hey girl

1493
02:30:35,740 --> 02:30:52,900

1494
02:30:38,620 --> 02:30:56,710
okay watch go get it [ __ ] [ __ ]

1495
02:30:52,900 --> 02:30:59,370

1496
02:30:56,710 --> 02:31:03,931
you killed now you're gonna play with it

1497
02:30:59,370 --> 02:31:03,931
would you feel bad for killing his dog

1498
02:31:06,391 --> 02:31:09,630
good job

1499
02:31:11,220 --> 02:31:18,271
typically you kill the dog bro you wanna

1500
02:31:13,960 --> 02:31:18,271
try that doesn't seem like a good idea

1501
02:31:20,490 --> 02:31:27,480
she's not going to bite right nope I

1502
02:31:24,730 --> 02:31:27,480
promise

1503
02:31:31,400 --> 02:31:37,790
that's the worst I guess I can't judge

1504
02:31:40,580 --> 02:31:47,270
what can I do it again no no I think she

1505
02:31:44,880 --> 02:31:47,270
would love that

1506
02:31:48,320 --> 02:31:52,010
keep the hog tuned

1507
02:31:59,270 --> 02:32:14,939
my turn

1508
02:32:01,070 --> 02:32:18,170
and secret get out doesn't let me we

1509
02:32:14,939 --> 02:32:18,170
should keep looking for him

1510
02:32:22,700 --> 02:32:43,710
let it go let it go don't hold day-dawn

1511
02:32:28,920 --> 02:32:45,540
any mo game makes you feel something

1512
02:32:43,710 --> 02:32:47,310
it's done and strong I guess so

1513
02:32:45,540 --> 02:32:49,170
I mean that's why I was thinking like

1514
02:32:47,310 --> 02:32:53,280
I'd rather slightest games than a really

1515
02:32:49,170 --> 02:32:58,530
mediocre sequel hey do you think maybe I

1516
02:32:53,280 --> 02:33:00,090
could convince your mom she saw him like

1517
02:32:58,530 --> 02:33:07,020
this she'd strangle him with her bare

1518
02:33:00,090 --> 02:33:08,490
hands I'm actually curious how they get

1519
02:33:07,020 --> 02:33:14,790
those scars did he tell you I never

1520
02:33:08,490 --> 02:33:19,100
honestly not much I heard some of your

1521
02:33:14,790 --> 02:33:19,100
people calling him Lily

1522
02:33:24,820 --> 02:33:35,310
for a long time I didn't understand why

1523
02:33:29,470 --> 02:33:35,310
he was questioning the laws traditions

1524
02:33:35,521 --> 02:33:45,670
when he explained to me how he felt

1525
02:33:41,470 --> 02:33:47,790
inside I told him he had to keep it to

1526
02:33:45,670 --> 02:33:47,790
himself

1527
02:33:50,319 --> 02:33:54,880
I was hoping it'd snap out of it he

1528
02:33:54,040 --> 02:34:02,470
seemed to fine

1529
02:33:54,880 --> 02:34:09,189
for a while then he shaved his head okay

1530
02:34:02,470 --> 02:34:13,689
so he wasn't that guy was suicide is

1531
02:34:09,189 --> 02:34:19,319
that when you ran first I screamed at

1532
02:34:13,689 --> 02:34:19,319
him I hit him

1533
02:34:21,250 --> 02:34:24,250
stupid

1534
02:34:27,750 --> 02:34:34,521
yeah I have an idea when we find

1535
02:34:31,830 --> 02:34:34,521
somebody chairman

1536
02:34:46,619 --> 02:34:52,140
why do you think he did it now shaved

1537
02:34:49,500 --> 02:34:55,649
his head I mean last week he got

1538
02:34:52,140 --> 02:34:58,050
assigned his role in the community he

1539
02:34:55,649 --> 02:35:00,390
wanted to be a soldier like sir cool but

1540
02:34:58,050 --> 02:35:11,189
they decided he was to be a wife to one

1541
02:35:00,390 --> 02:35:13,819
of the elders hmm where is Santa Barbara

1542
02:35:11,189 --> 02:35:16,520
yes Seattle's in the north of California

1543
02:35:13,819 --> 02:35:19,100

1544
02:35:16,520 --> 02:35:25,319

1870
03:10:54,840 --> 03:10:58,790

1875
03:11:07,790 --> 03:11:10,359

1876
03:11:12,150 --> 03:11:18,980
somewhere I heard that get the moves

1877
03:11:16,800 --> 03:11:18,980

I'll look for it thanks guys

1880
03:11:36,060 --> 03:11:40,950
it seems like the kind of people that

1881
03:11:37,960 --> 03:11:40,950
would have bazookas around

1882
03:11:52,751 --> 03:11:58,621
this is bad I'm gonna get through this

1883
03:11:58,951 --> 03:12:04,751
the gate will be locked the lumber mill

1884
03:12:03,070 --> 03:12:07,480

1885
03:12:04,751 --> 03:12:11,501

1886
03:12:07,480 --> 03:12:14,280

03:12:11,501 --> 03:12:14,280
kids to the ranch

1888
03:12:31,340 --> 03:12:34,271

1889
03:12:35,390 --> 03:12:40,609
okay they build walls and [ __ ] that's

1890
03:12:37,129 --> 03:12:41,330

1891
03:12:40,609 --> 03:12:44,420
they're [ __ ] everywhere

1892
03:12:41,330 --> 03:12:44,420
[Music]

1893
03:12:58,330 --> 03:13:02,229
and I wish you could move body

1894
03:13:07,699 --> 03:13:10,930
kind of wanted to shoot her

1895
03:13:18,840 --> 03:13:27,240
[ __ ] it what I said no find who did this

1896
03:13:28,571 --> 03:13:38,901

03:13:31,871 --> 03:13:54,440

03:13:38,901 --> 03:13:56,741

1899
03:13:54,440 --> 03:13:56,741
good

1900
03:14:12,740 --> 03:14:16,260
justise plan this is part of the plan by

1901
03:14:15,390 --> 03:14:19,021
the way

1902
03:14:16,260 --> 03:14:33,390
I call this the stealth strategy not a

1903
03:14:19,021 --> 03:14:36,410
lot of people can pull it off on you say

1904
03:14:33,390 --> 03:14:36,410
how you stopped here

1905
03:14:45,140 --> 03:14:48,949
see the game wants you to think that

1906
03:14:47,119 --> 03:14:52,069
you're supposed to stealth this area but

1907
03:14:48,949 --> 03:14:53,840
in reality life doesn't always work out

1908
03:14:52,069 --> 03:14:57,199
like that so it's really a lesson in the

1909
03:14:53,840 --> 03:14:58,939
game about animal head all right

1910
03:14:57,199 --> 03:15:01,120

1911
03:14:58,939 --> 03:15:04,189

03:15:46,239 --> 03:15:52,700
there's only two guys left right

1917
03:15:50,150 --> 03:15:58,681
