263
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:51,040
one thing we have these magma blaze rods

264
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:55,000
and ender pearls we have a lot of ender

265
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:59,680
pearls for ones and so I think you do

266
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,910
this I'm not sure and then you do this

267
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,280
yes

268
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:05,680
all right let's bring a couple because I

269
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,460
think they break on the way when you're

270
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,640
coming with me

271
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:11,050
should I bring Garrigan smoking I feel

272
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,390
like I should bring Jurgen smart again I

273
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:17,170
think I think two pegs is well enough to

274
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:19,780
bring okay sorry class all down the

275
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:22,900
fortress okay so last time we threw the

276
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:24,490
ender pearl or the eye of ender it went

277
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:27,070
that direction so I think we should just

278
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:29,350
start going there so I want to throw it

279
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:31,900
as little as possible okay as long as

280
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:34,420
it's not as far as the freaking mansion

281
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:36,160
oh god it could actually be as far as

282
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:38,740
the mansion oh god I don't want to do

283
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,850
that at least then you know Ellie's man

284
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:42,580
because I think we're gonna have to go

285
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:43,630
far and I I can't do that to our walk

286
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:46,420
again I just can't

287
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:48,700

chance of breaking or did I pick it up

300
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:19,930
