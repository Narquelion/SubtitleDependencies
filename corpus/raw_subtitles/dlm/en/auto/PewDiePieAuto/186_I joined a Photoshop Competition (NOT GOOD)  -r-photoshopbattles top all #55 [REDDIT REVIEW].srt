00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,640
today I'm entering a bit of a

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:08,069
competition we're doing reddit Photoshop

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,530
battles this is actually how I learned

4
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:12,929
Photoshop I used to do tiny like

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,679
sub-community competition in like anime

6
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:15,179
forums

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,890
I remember how thrilling it was to

8
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:18,600
submit and have people vote on what you

9
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,050
made in Photoshop I thought that was so

10
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,930
fun

11
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,850
even if five people participated it was

12
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:27,029
still cool and that's what got me into

13
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:28,859
Photoshop so I thought I'll submit to

14
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:31,109
some of these I really liked the seal

15
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:33,350
one that was supposed to 11 hours ago

16
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:39,540
let's have a look at our competition

17
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:41,399
okay all right yeah all right I feel

18
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,649
like I can I can probably make something

19
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:46,410
out of this because it's already so

20
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:48,329
funny whenever I see chins I just want

21
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,190
to add more Chin's but then again

22
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:52,440
there's not that much to work with maybe

23
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,750
I can try and make the background a

24
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:58,050
little bigger see I mean already that

25
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:59,969
looks I didn't mean for that alright

26
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:02,760
we've made it bigger this means of

27
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:04,500
course we can add more chins nothing

28
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,270
like a good chin you know what I mean

29
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:12,180
you ever made something and then you

30
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:15,200
realise is complete garbage yeah oh man

31
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:19,380
that really did it didn't it

32
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:24,720
I'm shoulder I mean this calls for blush

33
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:26,340
cheeks okay alright I guess

34
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,000
uncomfortable is what we're going with

35
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:32,600
here I don't care if it's good it's

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,600
making me laugh

37
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:40,270
I want people that really truly question

38
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:44,380
their sexuality do you think we can add

39
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:47,380
a wig oh yeah oh yeah yes we can

40
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:49,180
yeah I'll freak a walrus I need

41
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:54,430
something higher resolution as well

42
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:59,680
okay okay okay girl keep talking all

43
00:01:54,430 --> 00:02:01,860
right and let's lend shadows is really

44
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,880
what makes it come alive I think and

45
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,490
messing with light and stuff like then

46
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:11,410
on this photo we can see that the whites

47
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:14,230
are really popped I don't know yeah see

48
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:16,150
he's got the blend on the on the top and

49
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:19,750
we can't have that just trying to create

50
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:21,760
this yeah if we want to be like

51
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:25,570
attention to detail I guess the hair is

52
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:27,270
like hitting the water or something look

53
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:29,740
at that

54
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:31,810
sounded pretty good guess we should do

55
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:35,980
the lips as well it's got a little bit

56
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:36,700
of that Joker touch to it but you know I

57
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,709
like it

58
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:41,050
I really want to hit the sparkle on the

59
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:43,750
eye oh yeah that's dark in the roots all

60
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:47,050
that does a lot nice she has that kind

61
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:49,209
of faves you know it's a she

62
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:52,180
wish I want to play a fun more a bit

63
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:58,450
subtly like oh oh

64
00:02:52,180 --> 00:03:02,050
standby oh yes I'm shading what you

65
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:04,870
think I am shading no I don't need you

66
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:06,190
to judge me for it okay all right I want

67
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,200
to do others as well so I'm just gonna

68
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:10,360
end that there and save it this is

69
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:13,030
actually the first time I pull something

70
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:15,640
like this so what that was to start this

71
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:23,110
is the result okay so it's uploaded I'm

72
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:26,110
sorry in advance all right let's move on

73
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:30,700
to the next one okay

74
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:32,890
a blue whale pooping what people talk

75
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:35,140
about plastic in the ocean but blue

76
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:35,890
whales poop come on dude that's

77
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:39,890
disgusting

78
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:43,220
alright that's nice that's garbage

79
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:46,540
what would I do would first cover up all

80
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:49,790
the poop so we got a fresh fresh ocean

81
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:50,440
nice and clean and then see what we can

82
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:59,479
do with this

83
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:59,479
[Music]

84
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:14,230
[Music]

85
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:16,239
haha I've done it it's fun

86
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:18,669
I get to do typography I haven't done

87
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:22,449
that in so long I'll just go into the

88
00:04:18,669 --> 00:04:25,120
air I guess guess it makes more sense

89
00:04:22,449 --> 00:04:27,040
that it ends on the f' guess if you want

90
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,190
to be picky it should like fade over

91
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:33,040
time or something like he started riding

92
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:36,510
Epstein should be more faded as well I

93
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:39,900
realized but I think that's good for now

94
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:44,889
it makes me laugh so that's always good

95
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:48,639
original remake time to comment what are

96
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:50,320
the odds I can't wait to go back and

97
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,180
later in a few days to check what people

98
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,910
are saying that's gonna be my favorite

99
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:57,940
part all right let's pick two or three

100
00:04:54,910 --> 00:05:00,120
more okay here's an easy one you just

101
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:03,460
change the TV I mean come on

102
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:06,639
okay there's a couple already yeah

103
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:09,280
alright this is extremely difficult I

104
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:12,039
mean this required immense amount of

105
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,830
skill and technique to really properly

106
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:19,360
pull off yeah not even worth posting I'm

107
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:21,370

108
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,099

turn gamer my time to shine

111
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:31,630
what I like about this is that you can

112
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:33,370
easily make it bigger very easily the

113
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:35,740
background is essentially blue anyway

114
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:38,200
there you go pretty well blended now we

115
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:40,599
can make his limbs now we can focus on

116
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:46,990
making his limbs gigantic without even

117
00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:48,750
having to mask a lot of it leg you know

118
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:51,490
let's just get rid of the tennis racket

119
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:53,639
it looks funny if you don't have it I

120
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:55,750
[Music]

121
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:58,510

a lot of things I can do with this I

169
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:18,330
feel like the obvious is just to put

170
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,950
some sort of low polygon yeah maybe I'll

171
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:22,440
put her inside

172
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:23,970

173
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,890
that looks like [ __ ] okay I'll do

174
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:28,410
