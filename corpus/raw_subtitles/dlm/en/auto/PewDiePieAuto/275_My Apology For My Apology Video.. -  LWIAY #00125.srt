334
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:34,060
suck a PP did you know that if a

335
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:36,880
restaurant messes up your order you can

336
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:38,380
simply say oh actually I had instead of

337
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,270
screaming at the 16 year old employee

338
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:44,110
and they will still fix it for you

339
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:46,840
yeah that's fair that is fair my

340
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:49,030
strategy is always before I get angry I

341
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:50,770
double check because it's so easy to do

342
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:53,140
you got to hear their side first

343
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:54,730
and if they sit back up and they say

344
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:56,830
guys stand their ground then you can get

345
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:58,150
angry like sometimes things can just be

346
00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:01,810
a misunderstanding but

347
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:03,400
to misunderstandings then they die then

348
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:12,390
they get the wrath of the floor gang oh

349
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:16,260
