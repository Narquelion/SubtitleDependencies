to molest him no one likes opening doors

57
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,970
for anyone that much spoilers the reason

58
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:17,980
is because a cool cat

59
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:20,170
and open doors because of his giant

60
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:21,610

some sort of way for this guy the

112
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,880
director and the writer to just show off

113
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:18,650
whatever it is he wants to show off you

114
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,570

115
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:23,240
I thought this wasn't actually real I

116
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:26,540
thought this movie he was one of those

117
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:30,020
movies purposely made to be bad that's

118
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:32,630
not the case after some examination it's

119
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:34,820

understand yo

195
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,860
it's always really good in the movie

196
00:11:13,149 --> 00:11:15,639
when you get to see someone walking down

197
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:18,459
the stairs

198
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:20,410
that always makes a good movie if you

199
00:11:18,459 --> 00:11:27,579
get a full sequence of someone walking

200
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:29,920

[Music]

251
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:23,360
[Music]

252
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,360
cougar

00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:39,930

looks like the parade so they just

257
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:54,210
hijacked someone else parade but then

258
00:14:52,170 --> 00:15:02,880
they are actually in the parade and I'm

259
00:14:54,210 --> 00:15:04,740
just like what is his parade cool cat is

260
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,000
the creation of Hollywood's very own

261
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:08,430
Derrick Savage

262
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,350
cool cat and his adventures are featured

263
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:13,230
in several children's books including

264
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:15,450
cool cat loves karate as well as a new

265
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:19,710
video project called cool cat stops

266
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:23,420
bullying cool cat is holding me at

267
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:26,220
gunpoint cool cat is the greatest movie

268
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:29,190
like how he brought his camera for this

269
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:31,530
event but the shots that he gets of the

270
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:34,740
audience it's just like actually worse

271
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:36,690
quality than my videos it's always so

272
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:38,460
weird to me like this guy clearly tried

273
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:40,250
to create some sort of concept you

274
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:44,400
probably put a lot of money and time and

275
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:47,910
effort into it it's you know in a way I

276
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:50,790
feel bad but also cool cat I don't know

277
00:15:47,910 --> 00:16:02,400
so all the sudden tables are turned here

278
00:15:50,790 --> 00:16:05,640
that the bullied becomes a bully and

279
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:07,620
they added as a trivia character error

280
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:09,600
despite the matter yeah and cool cat

281
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:12,360
said earlier that bullying is bad and

282
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,550
shouldn't be done so it done she is

283
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,470
later seen bullying butch by making fun

284
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:18,690

285
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:20,820
house of vivica a fox then all the

286
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:23,070

287
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:25,470
the scenes I don't know who he is but

288
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:30,000

everyone how do we stop bullying I just

315
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:21,340
let the cops arrest the bully that's all

316
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:24,010
that you need to do this sends a great

317
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:27,160
message and how to stop bullying I never

318
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:30,429
seen any more better ideas

319
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:33,010

320
00:18:30,429 --> 00:18:34,570
through the ranch kid I feel like it

321
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:36,309
would be a lot more forgiving to this

322
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:38,620
film if it actually had some good

323
00:18:36,309 --> 00:18:41,830
anti-bullying message that I could

324
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:43,330
actually kids benefit from so then the

325
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:48,419
movie takes it really really really

326
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:48,419
really weird turn cool cat finds a gun

327
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:57,730
now you can shoot the bully defense

328
00:18:55,059 --> 00:19:00,450
somehow they mess it up and their bully

329
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:00,450
