it's so stupid I think what bothers me

82
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:54,100
most about the current political climate

83
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:56,410
is the fact that you know the opinion

84
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:58,720
that the majority has isn't gonna be

85
00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:01,000
remember in the future when they look

86
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,740
back at the shift happening now we're

87
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,840
all gonna look like idiots even if we're

88
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:06,970
