friend

242
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,320
hey you saw my first messages with my

243
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,560
turn if you show him

244
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,440
that you're interested right away

245
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,519
instead of acting

246
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,360
like some little beta [ __ ] trying to

247
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,360
act like a nice guy hoping to win there

248
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,360
off because you're too much of a [ __ ]

249
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,360
to confess that you like someone and

250
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,200
then you carry up all this anger and

251
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,880
resentment towards that person

252
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,440
and then tell them to [ __ ] off just

253
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:42,480
because they don't see you that way

254
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,040
even though it's your fault entirely all

255
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,240
right

256
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:48,240
