1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,300
if you don't know what stoicism is don't

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,430
worry I didn't used to have a clue

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,379
either even in my last philosophy video

4
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,090
I said this I find it kind of humorous

5
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:11,099
with the neverending self-help books

6
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,230
that exists that still tries to answer

7
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:16,080
this question today when it was answered

8
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:18,630
over 2,000 years ago by the ancient

9
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,100
Greek word eudaimonia I was talking

10
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:22,199
about happiness and what the best

11
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,880
practice to achieve it was the irony of

12
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:26,070
my statement is that a lot of self-help

13
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,779
book today are based on stoic practices

14
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,250
but I have been rebranded to fit the

15
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:30,840
modern world so even if you're not

16
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,520
familiar with stoicism there's still a

17
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,140
good chance that you practice it even

18
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,360
without knowing it for example things

19
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,520
like journaling meditating practice of

20
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,800
self-restraint are all in a way stoic

21
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,960
exercises even cognitive behavioral

22
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,910
therapy which some psychiatrists use to

23
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,039
treat their patients were developed out

24
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:49,200
of the ideas of stoicism the difference

25
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,969
is that CBT is used to help patients for

26
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,739
the time they need it while stoicism

27
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:54,930
goes beyond and is more of a way of life

28
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:56,550
so to explain what so is ISM is can

29
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,530
sometimes be tricky because it's a wide

30
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,300
subject with many great practices and

31
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,010
many great philosophers so let's begin

32
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,660
with its origins because to fully

33
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,280
understand and engage with ideas we need

34
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,500
to understand where they came from I

35
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,570
think that was so Cretaceous I love the

36
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,340
origin of stoicism its foundation comes

37
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,890
from its own name which in latin is

38
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,750
stoah i like iris tatl in plato who had

39
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,299
their famous grandeur in schools stoah

40
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,890
meant simply a painted porch this is

41
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:21,780
where the first teaching of stoicism

42
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,909
were held stoicism derives directly from

43
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,049
cynicism if you watch my last video in

44
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:26,759
Diogenes some sign up

45
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:28,829
I find it mind-boggling that a man

46
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,229
living inside a barrel affects our life

47
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:33,240
still to this day and how we live so

48
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:35,009
weeks recognize just like cynicism that

49
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,900
virtue is the only good the main

50
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:38,729
difference here is that instead of

51
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,979
neglecting anything that isn't according

52
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:43,079
to nature so it's recognized that some

53
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:45,240
things such as money for example are not

54
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:47,610
necessarily good or bad in themselves or

55
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,560
they can be used for good or bad too for

56
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:51,450
that matter Plato and Aristotle share

57
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,310
this view as well and they don't count

58
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,380
as Stoics so let's just get into the

59
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,909
nuances there are many great Stoics

60
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,469
epictetus being one of the most

61
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:00,869
recognized but there is no written

62
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:02,520
record of his practice but luckily for

63
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:04,469
us I think this is so cool

64
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,659
he had a fan that wasn't just anybody

65
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:07,890
but the Roman Emperor of that time

66
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:10,379
Marcus Aurelius

67
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,360
Marcus frequently quotes epictetus in

68
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:14,730
his famous written word meditation

69
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,340
Epictetus describe what the fundamentals

70
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:19,380
of psoases amaze which is actually very

71
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,030
simple it goes like this there are

72
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:23,160
things in life you can't control and

73
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:25,020
there are things that happen without our

74
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,210
control or beyond our control

75
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,740
according to Epictetus we should calmly

76
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:30,990
accept when things out of our control

77
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:33,000
happen but we as individuals can however

78
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:34,800
control our own actions through

79
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,570
self-discipline you probably done this

80
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,730
yourself at some point without the

81
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:39,860
self-discipline part when realizing that

82
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,940
something was out of your control

83
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:44,010
suddenly and abruptly what has

84
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,780
previously seemed terrible becomes

85
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:47,460
unimportant the idea of not letting

86
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,990
things out of your control change your

87
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:51,300
behavior is a simple practice that

88
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:53,220
anyone can immediately grasp but it's

89
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:56,310
much much harder to act upon achieving

90
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:58,950
virtue is not easy however the length

91
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:01,200
the Stoics went with this idea is often

92
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:03,510
heavily criticised misunderstood and

93
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,570
dismissed as being called an epithet 'ok

94
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:08,790
here's an example xenophobe when told

95
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:11,400
about the death of his child responded

96
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:13,650
simply and calmly with I knew my son was

97
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,360
immortal you can take the extreme of

98
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:17,160
this quote in any way you want but the

99
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,290
reality of the lesson is to simply not

100
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:21,300
fight against nature and let it consume

101
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:23,610
you focus on what you can't control

102
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,440
and let it be your virtue Marcus

103
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:27,930
Aurelius who is known as one of the five

104
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,540
good Roman emperors did not live an easy

105
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,100
life he dealt with chronic pain and his

106
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:34,620
ruling as Emperor would be fought

107
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:36,450
against to practice self-control every

108
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:38,250
morning Marcus would meditate he would

109
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:40,140
meditate over all the bad horrible

110
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,580
things and people that would oppose him

111
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:43,260
that day here's a quote from his

112
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:45,660
meditations when you wake up in the

113
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:47,730
morning tell yourself the people I deal

114
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:50,370
with today will be meddling ungrateful

115
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:51,900
arrogant dishonest jealous and surly

116
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:53,820
they are like this because they can't

117
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,739
tell good from evil but I have seen the

118
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:57,570
beauty of good and the ugliness of evil

119
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:59,730
and have recognized that the wrongdoer

120
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:01,410
has a nature related to my own not of

121
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:03,330
the same blood and birth but the same

122
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:05,640
mind and possessing a share of the

123
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:07,830
divine and so none of them can hurt me

124
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,810
no one can implicate me in ugliness nor

125
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:11,730
can I feel angry at my relative or hate

126
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:14,519
him we were born to work together like

127
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:16,680
thief hands and eyes like the two rows

128
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:18,900
of teeth upper and lower to obstruct

129
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,150
each other is unnatural to feel anger at

130
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,140
someone to turn your back on him these

131
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:24,810
are unnatural

132
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:25,260
despite cbt deriving from stoicism as

133
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,630
previous

134
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:29,580
mention sources emit self doesn't talk

135
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:31,830
much about depression services some

136
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,870
focus rather more on anger they look at

137
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:36,000
anger as Marcus describes as ugly and

138
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:38,490
irrational if you imagine an angry face

139
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,500
it's rarely a pretty one however it's an

140
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:42,600
emotion that is often today displayed in

141
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,670
media when a character in a film for

142
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,590
example acts in revenge he's often seen

143
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:48,390
carrying at the same bad lead that was

144
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:50,700
originally done to him but we still

145
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:52,710
recognize his action as somewhat Noble

146
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:54,180
and satisfying we even enjoy seeing

147
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:56,640
anger if it's justified

148
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,830
Marcus however received the word one day

149
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:01,260
that his close friend in general Ovidius

150
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:03,270
kasia's had betrayed him kasia's had

151
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:05,130
found out a rumor that Marcus was close

152
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:06,750
to death and possibly even dead

153
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:09,090
and so Casius took this as an

154
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:11,250
opportunity to declare himself as a new

155
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:13,290
Caesar a betrayal of this magnitude

156
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:15,000
would enrage and upset anyone if it

157
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:17,310
happened to us but well Marcus did

158
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,440
especially for the time being was

159
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:21,150
astounding he did nothing he didn't want

160
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,500
to cause panic among his people if the

161
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:24,930
word got out of the betrayal and

162
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,940
confusing of ruling he instead acted

163
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:28,980
rationally without anger and without

164
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:31,320
hatred and made the announcement that he

165
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:33,660
will march against Casius not to kill

166
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:35,220
him but to capture him when a friend

167
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:37,410
betrays us we have every right to get

168
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:39,300
angry but Marcus controlled this anger

169
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:41,190
even mentioned that he hoped Cassio's

170
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,320
would not kill himself in shame before

171
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:45,030
his arrival for Marcus coming would be a

172
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,740
great testimony of his virtue

173
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:49,890
Marcus managed to not just calm himself

174
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:51,660
but his people and while doing so he did

175
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:53,910
what needed to be done which was to

176
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:55,980
secure the Empire and he succeeded

177
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:57,480
Plato long before him said that

178
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,940
philosophers should be Kings

179
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:02,190
this act of Marcus was a true testimony

180
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:04,560
to that statement a famous story quote

181
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:06,300
once said it is not possible to live

182
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,640
well today unless you treat it as your

183
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,650
last death is always near in stoicism

184
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:12,900
markers meditated heavily on this theme

185
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:14,370
as well it might seem morbid but it

186
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,470
helps remind oneself to live in the

187
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:18,450
moment it helps you build virtue build

188
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:20,940
character and prepare yourself to be

189
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:22,770
ready to depart at any moment Marcus

190
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:25,080
would meditate every evening to remind

191
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:26,850
himself to be grateful for every day to

192
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,680
me this is the most powerful part of

193
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:30,510
Stoicism it's called memento mori

194
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,190
remember that you might have heard it

195
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:34,170
before I used to study a fair bit of

196
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:36,270
Buddhism and what struck a chord in me

197
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:37,810
was the idea of reincarnation if you

198
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:39,669
live a virtuous life you will be

199
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:41,560
rewarded in the next but if there's no

200
00:06:39,669 --> 00:06:43,240
reincarnation then you still live the

201
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,220
virtuous life Marcus had the same

202
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,570
sentiment but for it way more eloquently

203
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:48,700
here's another quote from his

204
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:50,470
meditations live a good life if there

205
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,120
are gods and they are just then they

206
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:53,740
will not care how devout you have been

207
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,540
but will welcome you based on the

208
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:56,020
virtues you have lived by if there are

209
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,730
gods

210
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:59,800
but unjust then you should not want to

211
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:01,570
worship them if there are no gods then

212
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,220
you will be gone but when I've lived a

213
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:05,260
noble life that will live on in the

214
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:07,810
memories of the loved ones just like

215
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:09,669
Nietzsche said he was a why to live for

216
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:11,560
can bear almost any how if you have a

217
00:07:09,669 --> 00:07:13,780
purpose you can live through any pain

218
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:16,090
and suffering the purpose for the stoic

219
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:17,830
is virtue and it turns any pain on its

220
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:19,510
head that's what makes so isn't so

221
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:21,310
powerful and timeless that is still

222
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:23,470
practiced today memento mori

223
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:25,690
do not let it frighten you or remind you

224
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:28,030
to live life with virtue memento mori

225
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:29,710
by practicing so is ISM there's no pain

226
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:31,630
and suffering in this world that you

227
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:33,610
can't endure memento mori

228
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:36,430
nothing can be taken from you for a

229
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:38,110
stoic only values virtue memento mori

230
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:39,880
any suffering and pain will be an

231
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:42,340
opportunity for you to display and

232
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:43,630
practice your virtue memento mori by

233
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:45,400
living life to the fullest

234
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:47,590
you are also ready to let go at any

235
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,870
moment to not meet death with fear or

236
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:52,180
anger or rather welcoming because some

237
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:55,320
