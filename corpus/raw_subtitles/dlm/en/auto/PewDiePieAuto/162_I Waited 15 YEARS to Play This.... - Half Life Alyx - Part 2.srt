1
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:07,859

00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:11,730
welcome back

3
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:14,250
Oh to Alex got a lot of great feedback

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:16,049
from the last episode it should be a

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:19,080
little smoother for you guys now I don't

6
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:21,300
know if you can tell basically if I look

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,550
it should be less like which was

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:27,230
annoying another thing was that you guys

9
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:29,369
wanted me to actually move in the game I

10
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:31,289
was being a little selfish

11
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:33,719
okay I was being a little selfish

12
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:34,410
because I don't I get the motion sick

13
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,649
very easily

14
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:40,350
and I don't like feeling sick I'm sorry

15
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:42,540
but there's a lot more people watching

16
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,309
than me playing so I was supposed to

17
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:49,280
look through the AI to find a puzzle but

18
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:49,280
I just luckily got the right one anyway

19
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:56,550

20
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,410

22
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:04,470
raving about the game so that makes me

23
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,689
very excited what's happening you guys

24
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,369
also told me to look around more I'm so

25
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:09,930
surprised that that's the feedback I got

26
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:14,220
cuz that's what people tell me every

27
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:16,140
game I play I don't know how much fun

28
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:20,310

I was like oh I have no ammo and it

36
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:43,829

55
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,960

00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:47,520
all right cool found it

236
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:49,590
let's check this out for the meme in in

237
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:52,200
the original half-life it's a fly - I

238
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:54,570
mean there was always a ton of extra

239
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:57,930
like hidden stunned but they always

240
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:59,310
marked it with a half-life symbol so you

241
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:01,710
would always know if there is one nearby

242
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:08,610
I assumed they would do the same thing

243
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:10,920
in this game I just don't know that

244
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:14,390
looks like a weird guy I have one shot

245
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,390
left I don't know if I should just like

246
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:26,160
reload before or if I should conserve

247
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:34,950
that one shine I have a lot of health so

248
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:39,150
I'll confirm the shot where oh there I

249
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:45,000
see it that zombie has a shotgun if only

250
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:51,770
we can like pin there alright alright

251
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:56,320
butyou check if it's safe is it safe

252
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:58,340
well no is it safe

253
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:01,670
I'm sure it's safe I'll be right there

254

all right so we're just gonna pull this

255
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:04,310

256
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:12,040
where would they come from

257
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:12,040

can I pull this down oh it's just a play

337
00:23:51,260 --> 00:24:03,370
great nice I keep thinking I put it in

338
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:05,720
and we write gamers you know I'm talking

339
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:08,260
well I'm ski excuse me I'm wearing this

340
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,260
for my face

341
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:21,890
God when he gets so close to me I can't

342
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:28,020
do it yeah

343
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:29,430
ain't nobody alright so I assume we have

344
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:39,690
to go up that ladder but I want to check

345
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:44,520
out here yeah okay don't do that

346
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:46,890
I hate those packaging things whenever

347
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:50,700
my take - I guess like punim promo stuff

348
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:53,970
because she she's like in the old beauty

349
00:24:50,700 --> 00:25:00,540
vlogger sphere and they send her so much

350
00:24:53,970 --> 00:25:02,640
stuff and they always package them I

351
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:05,850
thought that would be cool but I guess

352
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:08,400
not what they're not cool not cool it

353
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:12,000
what three shots kill I thought it was

354
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:15,530
the thing I thought three oh I hit the

355
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,460
[ __ ] aah I'm getting so annoyed

356
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:21,960
alright let's go back and check the

357
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:27,840
thing I hit the trigger with the fire

358
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:29,430
hitting the everything I said about

359
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:32,210
getting better is getting worse it's

360
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:32,210
getting worse gamers

361
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:50,390
