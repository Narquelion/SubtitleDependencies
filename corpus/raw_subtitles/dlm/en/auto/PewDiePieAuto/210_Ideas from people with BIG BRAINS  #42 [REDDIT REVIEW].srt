it and give the person using it and

58
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:58,130
paralyze be expected

59
00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:00,530
it's like when you're waiting for the

00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:02,510
elevator and the the button is clearly

61
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:04,310

69
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:25,760
with capitalist America why can't they

70
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:28,610

71
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,860
ball but they chose not to disgusting

72
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:34,000
