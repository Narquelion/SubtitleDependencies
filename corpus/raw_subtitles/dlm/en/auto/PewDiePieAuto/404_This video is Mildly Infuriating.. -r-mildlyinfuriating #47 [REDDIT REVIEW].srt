infuriating this is make you Molly

6
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:18,660
infuriated I have a confession to make

7
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:22,500
first of all when I looked up at this

8
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:24,510
subreddit this image shows up the way my

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,720
grandmother eats pizza

10
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:30,779
I've eaten pizza this way for over 20

11
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,969
years and every time we are out with

12
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:35,100
French and I start eating my pizza it

13
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:37,050
always goes weird and quiet and I'm like

14
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,399
what and everyone's just staring to what

15
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:41,040
I'm doing to the pizza

16
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:45,180
it's amazing what you eat pizza with

17
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:48,390
your hands creams bro listen there's a

18
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:51,660
stigma all I ask is that you try it ok

19
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:54,180
it's really epic I don't like the crust

20
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:56,010
and when you're done eating it you have

21
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,079
a pizza frame and you can put your face

22
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:01,230
in it and be like hey pizza face it

23
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:07,140
salsa I'll cut you with you try it and

24
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:10,140
then you can see if you like it alright

25
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:13,439
let's move on to more mildly infuriating

26
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:15,420
shin Buster 9000 I'm not sure what I'm

27
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,460
looking at it's not a bed frame that

28
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,259
sticks out I think that site is supposed

29
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,970
to go towards the wall you're you

30
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:23,009
literally that you're using your bed

31
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:26,100
backwards that is making me more

32
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:28,740
infuriated hits then the post itself job

33
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:31,070
expectations minimum 5 years experience

34
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:34,350

35
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:38,430
animation or familiar seniority level

36
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:41,820
entry it's like the meme you need

37
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:43,130
experience to get job but I need job to

38
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,840
get experience

39
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:47,939
society seems fair YouTube they

40
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,600
monetizes tons of videos with no reason

41
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:52,619
whatsoever

42
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:54,930
also YouTube lies ecology I got this is

43
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:57,210
YouTube summarize this video showed up

44
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:59,969
in my recommendation it has like 80

45
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:02,070
million views because it has lice Aiko

46
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:04,079
she naked it'd be funny you could use

47
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:07,079

48
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:09,569
monetize yeah I'm gay I feel like I'm

00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:12,260
getting mildly but I'm getting mildly to

50
00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:15,080
monetize I mean fury ate it

51
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:18,799
happening written questions number two

52
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:23,030
political efficacy is described as what

53
00:02:18,799 --> 00:02:27,560
your vote counts answer incorrect answer

54
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:30,650

55
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:34,849
isn't measurable and my Friday is ruined

56
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:36,829
one two three four five seven that's it

57
00:02:34,849 --> 00:02:38,329
that is mylÃ¨ne for your reading I don't

58
00:02:36,829 --> 00:02:40,190
know it's a I feel like mildly

59
00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:41,900
infuriating is worse than just

60
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:43,879
infuriating because if you really gotta

61
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:46,040
amp yourself up to get really infuriated

62
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:47,900
about something mildly infuriating it's

63
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,879
like someone poking you with a stick and

64
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,680
I hear you annoyed are you annoyed yet

65
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:53,599
that's what it that's like that's like

66
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,609
when you try and enjoy your pizza and

67
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,989
you start eating it and everyone judges

68
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:59,930
you for the way you eat your pizza

69
00:02:56,989 --> 00:03:01,790

70
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:04,730

71
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:07,459

five point five correct nineteen forty

73
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:11,480
eight point fifty did I say it wrong

74
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:13,340
that would be mildly infuriating if I

75
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:16,519
said it wrong people who do this are

76
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:18,650
just the worst sell chicken what do you

77
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:21,019
mean people there aren't vegans shut up

78
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:22,549
vegans okay no I I get it

79
00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:26,299
I do this all the time I wouldn't do it

80
00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:27,379
with a frozen food that's come on they

81
00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:29,180
have people there they gotta do

82
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:30,680
something I'm joking of course

83
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:33,139
I only do it if I'm really in a hurry

84
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,489
okay I actually I don't even do it that

85
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:37,669
anymore I don't do it anymore

86
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:40,879
my new insurance refuses to pay for meds

87
00:03:37,669 --> 00:03:43,040
I've been on for years my doc gets free

88
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,930
samples and gives them to me this is the

89
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,870
packaging for 15 days of pills

90
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:49,940
what there's so many layers of

91
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:53,209
infuriating here the waste of packaging

92
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:56,090
get a tune by be like ah what I can see

93
00:03:53,209 --> 00:04:00,139
the carbon I work with an office full of

94
00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:02,180
sadists oh the effort that this would

95
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:03,859
have taken as well that's beautiful

96
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,419
maybe they try to do like a creeper face

97
00:04:03,859 --> 00:04:07,400
and then it didn't work out at least

98
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:09,949
then I would be a well valid

99
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,790
justification these baseball fields in

100
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:13,459
my city ah

101
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:15,769
this makes me angry what is it about

102
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:17,900
symmetry that is so beautiful and what

103
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:20,359
is it about asymmetry that is so

104
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:22,370
infuriating what makes it so annoying

105
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:25,159
it's like I want to be God and just be

106
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:26,090
like you know I'm saying make part

107
00:04:25,159 --> 00:04:28,040
noises while I just

108
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:30,770
as well God that pisses me off I'm not

109
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:33,380
gonna lie too I'm actually quite pissy

110
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:35,180
peace please do not park like this this

111
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:37,160
is my car on the right I was

112
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:38,960
contemplating having to crawl across the

113
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,880
passenger seat when the woman who owned

114
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,590
the car on the Left came back I pointed

115
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,389
out calmly that she needs to be more

116
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:50,720
aware of the cars around her when

117
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:53,330
parking you were on the side of the how

118
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,760
do these people exist it blows my mind

119
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:58,400
she even tweeted it out peace is Christ

120
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:00,169
there's so many delusional people oh my

121
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,790
god it's like the other day I drove my

122
00:05:00,169 --> 00:05:03,950
sit to the airport and there was these

123
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:07,190
two two trucks literally next to each

124
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:09,320
other taking up both the in spaces we're

125
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:10,940
on a rush to go to the airport and this

126
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,169
is like a British road that changes

127
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,580
frequently it's not like there's this

128
00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:15,350
one road that they've been sitting on

129
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:17,150
for a long time there's no reason for

130
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:20,180
him to try and pass his truck that is

131
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:22,310
clearly driving the same speed as you

132
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:23,930
are and then when I passed him I

133
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:26,449
obviously have to tell him you're an

134
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:29,000
idiot so I hug ppppp you're an idiot

135
00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:30,440
and then he hung back at me and I hope

136
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,630
you're watching because you're a stinky

137
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,830
brainer don't ever hug back to me again

138
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:35,990
you're a fool

139
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:38,479
a stinky fool and I was mildly

140
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:40,700
infuriating the way my dad puts things

141
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:45,669
away in the fridge this is a piece of

142
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:49,580
steak mmm delicious steak for later look

143
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:52,700
I'll have that later thank you a plate

144
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:55,310
wrapping foil no waste of environment

145
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:57,470
straight to the fridge with you you know

146
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:59,330
what is this someone in my office keeps

147
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:03,860
pouring their coffee grounds the toilet

148
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:07,160
and leaving it like this that is very

149
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:09,860
important is more than mild maybe got on

150
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:12,470
the rim of the seat dude I don't want a

151
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:15,020
coffee but no one wants coffee but no

152
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:16,849
one I say it now I there's a stigma

153
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:19,099
against coffee butts my school that

154
00:06:16,849 --> 00:06:22,520
started an eco-friendly project by

155
00:06:19,099 --> 00:06:24,050
giving out apples to students okay I'm

156
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,690
already annoyed did you do this on

157
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:28,550
purpose whatever is wrong with you this

158
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:30,889
feels like Japan in Japan they have

159
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:33,050
super strict recycling rules let me see

160
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:34,490
if I can find it so naturally when me

161
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:36,860
and my sister try and recycle for the

162
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:38,810
first time we were terrified you have to

163
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,590
separate everything and if you mess up

164
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:41,930
you get the

165
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:43,880
red level of shame saying you did it

166
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:45,680
wrong and they won't accept your trash

167
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,390
and you're like oh that's that's

168
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,890
actually really good like everyone has

169
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:50,450
to recycle that's good for the

170
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:52,850
environment that everyone makes an

171
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:54,500
effort to recycle but my god they wrap

172
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:56,570
everything in plastic literally

173
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:58,190
everything is wrapped in plastic you buy

174
00:06:56,570 --> 00:07:00,320
candy and like every single piece of

175
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:01,850
candy is wrapped in plastic you buy

176
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:04,030
plastic and that's wrapped in plastic

177
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:07,160
what they need to do alright here's my

178
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:10,300
here's my pitch to save the environment

179
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:13,670
every single product has a designated

180
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:15,710
carton right a recyclable carton that

181
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:17,630
uses minimal amount of wasteful

182
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:20,780
materials if not hundred percent and

183
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:23,090
everything goes in a specific place so

184
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:24,980
they can all be used again at some point

327
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:22,940
honest but you've decided to just take a

328
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:25,640
photo of it instead of just telling

329
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:28,340
someone if it's annoying how is the

330
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:31,310

notifications and this number just won't

336
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:47,390

343
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:59,480
time

344
00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:00,290
keyboards like this I don't understand

345
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,380
the issue

346
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:05,090
there's no [ __ ] there's no space either

347
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:06,560
do you mean like when you have a remote

348
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:08,540
and you have to like go left and right

349
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,700
is that what's annoying cuz yes that is

350
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:12,650

00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:14,600
having PlayStation and Xbox accounts

352
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:16,520
because signing up and entering your

353
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,800
address and all that stuff it's the

354
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:21,530
worst all the urinals on campus do this

355
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,570

hell this is what I mean

362
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:50,050

Internet technology every time pushing

382
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:55,529
new boundaries but for some reason these

383
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:58,199
sinks exists why why do we still have

384
00:15:55,529 --> 00:16:00,120
medieval plumbing I don't need this

385
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:03,329
thing to either be burning hot or

386
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:05,279
freezing cold yes that is a problem for

387
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:08,490
someone who's very privileged but I

388
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:11,399
still annoying why why does it always

389
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:13,649
take so long for the sink to get hot all

390
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:17,190

391
00:16:13,649 --> 00:16:21,089
seconds to just wash my hands in regular

392
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:24,480
temperature water I am an adult and I

393
00:16:21,089 --> 00:16:26,850
deserve certain things this whole videos

394
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,740
me just seeming like it spoiled brat it

395
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:30,329
is annoying I just don't understand why

396
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:32,760
it's still a thing this has almost

397
00:16:30,329 --> 00:16:34,500
five-star rated why would anyone find

398
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,870
this oh this one actually you can change

399
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:40,199
what when there what's the point what is

400
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:41,100
this what is wrong with sinks sinks suck

401
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:43,890
so much

402
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:46,680
oh it's traditional their sign no its

it is you see one of these I leave I

405
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:54,779
lick my hands clean instead cuz that's

406
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:57,329
better than this take hot water you take

407
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:59,970
cold water and you combine it to a nice

408
00:16:57,329 --> 00:17:02,279
temperature don't separate them it ain't

409
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:03,180
that hard who came up with this idea it

410
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:05,520

enough to kill a man I hate sinks I hate

414
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:14,760
them the only thing annoying about this

415
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:17,429

so funny because Larry David actually

Marty's pizza is bigger than Lewis pizza

476
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:58,080
that is not possible because five six is

477
00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:01,740
greater than four sick so what is a more

we're clear if you're driving on a road

490
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,600
I understand that some cars have like a

491
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:32,310
limiter on them so they can't go past a

492
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,830
certain speed here's your answer

493
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:37,290
don't pass and I understand that some

494
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:39,720
cars it's illegal for them to blink out

495
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:41,400
to let people pass them because that

496
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,520
makes them legally viable and I

497
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:48,830
understand that you have a stinky brain

498
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,830
