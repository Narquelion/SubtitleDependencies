with more memes basically anything with

8
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:41,540
the first guy was probably like this guy

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:45,180

10
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:46,789

11
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:49,079

13
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:55,050

to ever get glasses mister be right it's

18
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:09,840
funny because it's scientifically

19
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,640
accurate and only really really smart

20
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,229
people would understand this meme dumb

21
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,390

oh you're awake I don't like I scare him

26
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:26,820

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:43,979
that underwent mitosis was to be like

33
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:46,590
it's funny because it's scientifically

34
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:48,479

it gets up okay that's what it gets if

191
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:53,830
anyone asks what you think of this meme

192
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:56,440
this is what you say life's meme guys

then you're fully updated on the memes

195
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:04,210
that if anyone asked what you think of

196
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:04,810
you can be like blip blop it's this

197
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:07,090
Indian guy

200
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:15,550
literally it's okay here's the original

201
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:18,220
one says two guys chillin and then

202
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:24,790
whatever happened no one knows but he

203
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:26,740
gets super angry why did they make this

204
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:29,140
with support I'm so confused

205
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:30,730
but it leads to the only thing important

206
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:32,710
here it doesn't matter okay

207
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:35,500
they leads to good memes and that's

208
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:37,270
really what we should all ask us ourself

209
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:39,160
about anything what's the purpose of

210
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,990
this if it isn't good memes then what's

211
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:43,119
the point

212
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:43,119
