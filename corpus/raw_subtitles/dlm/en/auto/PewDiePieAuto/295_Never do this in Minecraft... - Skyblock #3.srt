3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:15,269
smart kids who like to go way on up

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:17,670
beyond and do watch science okay

5
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:20,730
okay again cobblestone generator time

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,920
lights go okay I've got to make the

7
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,600
fastest cobblestone generator in the

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,220
planet I got a point out that we have

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,500
more than one island and the Sun is

10
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:33,350
moving I think double stone generator

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:55,800
you're doing it let's go okay all right

12
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:58,379

up you do lava I do lice okay wait we

21
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,100

22
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,860
they just gonna get robbed we don't do

23
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:51,240

learned our lesson at one time we've

31
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,420
built this stupid cobblestone generator

32
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:15,420
like 12 times now he's talking there

33
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:17,670

it's about getting it perfect any big

35
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:22,200
old doofus can build a cobblestone

36
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:24,150
generator but and not any big old doofus

37
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:29,790

38
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:33,240

need to throw out so that like generates

70
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:58,029

72
00:07:58,029 --> 00:08:04,149
you could actually miss you could

73
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:06,190
actually burn down the whole tree their

74
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:08,349
whole tree Wow

75
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:11,379

00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:05,300
sorry did I just make a cobblestone

88
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:06,709
generator I'm sorry why did you even

89
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:16,370

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,250
dig some dirt if I look up there the

93
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:24,650
trees on fire again are the cobblestone

94
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:28,250
generator is gone I'm gonna be bearing

95
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:32,770
with your generator is locked solid okay

96
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:35,900
it's but I can mind this right now right

97
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:37,690
mining it with my hands this is what we

98
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:45,020
used to do in Sweden in the Stone Age

99
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:47,930
right right hey maybe oh my god good job

100
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:50,029
of it see it's screwed up again why

101
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:51,950
would you ever think that I would mess

102
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:53,600
anything up maybe we'll get back up you

exactly I'm talking to that's right you

106
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:03,110
know that's what another noble price is

107
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:05,600
a Swedish invention because we were so

108
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:08,660
smart that we decided other people need

109
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,980
some words for smartness and who got the

110
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:14,150
first awarded you could give it to

111
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:18,160
yourselves we gave it to you know what

112
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:18,160

we're going backwards maybe okay this is

119
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:55,070
actually all the space we need yeah

120
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:55,070
eight times now okay okay wider than me

121

122
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:08,580
it's working so far see how easy it is

123
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:11,250
ken the water's like flowing backwards

124
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:13,980
is that right is that this first flow

125
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:15,750

spawn so can't spawn here but later what

286
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:19,450
we can do is we can make an island that

287
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:27,640
is 5 by 5 and we can use that to get the

288
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:30,040

00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:06,590
don't want to live anymore and he did

299
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:10,789
he'd left

300
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:14,409
oh then we go do we have to have him I

301
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:16,399

302
00:22:14,409 --> 00:22:20,029
we don't have another one how we gonna

303
00:22:16,399 --> 00:22:23,360

did we need him for something well we

306
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:29,749
can make them freak and we can give them

307
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:32,749
professions and then we can trade

308
00:22:29,749 --> 00:22:33,769
something it seems like pretty like late

309
00:22:32,749 --> 00:22:38,330
in the game that you would do something

310
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:40,820
like that but stay here okay good wait

311
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:44,029

wheat seeds so we can grow wheat so this

313
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:51,799
is going really really good I think

314
00:22:45,999 --> 00:22:53,330
trying to expand the land that's what

315
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:56,240
you Americans do don't you

316
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:57,350
yep that's right well I mean written

317
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:02,539
really right

318
00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:05,929

workbench they don't have to Frick but

324
00:23:17,539 --> 00:23:22,220
technically now since you kill one we

325
00:23:19,999 --> 00:23:24,619
can't expand the village maybe one will

326
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:27,230
magically reappear yeah maybe he'll just

327
00:23:24,619 --> 00:23:28,940
