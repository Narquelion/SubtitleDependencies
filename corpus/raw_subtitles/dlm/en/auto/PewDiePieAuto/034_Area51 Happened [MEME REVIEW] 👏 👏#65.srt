00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:36,239
okay so this is him he says he was here

44
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:38,519
a month ago I came here and I was

45
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,620
practicing my my route to running he was

46
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:42,569
the chosen one wait he actually went

47
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,420
there a month ago to practice that's

48
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:50,569
awesome but of course this means new

49
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:56,250
meme format sunlight prism rainbow

50
00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:58,769
cheese shredder try that chase I like it

51
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:01,500
that's a good meme template main quest

52
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:03,810
whatever I'm doing so what did people

53
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,209
actually do besides that one person

54
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:08,430
doing that route to run well you know

55
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:11,250
this is what the expectations were I

56
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:13,799
hate to break it to you this is this is

57
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:15,630
kind of how the race worth that but I

58
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:17,190
think it's probably for the better I'm

59
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:20,359
actually glad like no one did anything

60
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:23,459
stupid this is what it looked like

61
00:03:20,359 --> 00:03:26,250
clap alien cheeks save easy from the

62
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:27,599
government they are all idiots and men I

63
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,700
am truly proud of

64
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:33,349
I mean came and be mad at them at least

65
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:39,419
they showed up you know area 51 Stormers

66
00:03:33,349 --> 00:03:41,130
area 51 because facts no matter what

67
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:42,660
happens at the RF used to one rate every

68
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:44,549
single person action showed up isn't

69
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:47,130
frequently I kinda have to agree if you

70
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:49,139
like well done although if you live in

71
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:51,780
Nevada you're not a legend you're just a

72
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:53,760
local let's get real here how we thought

73
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,940
the area raid was gonna go I would

74
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,940
actually

75
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:05,300
again absolutely why would you want to

76
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,890
miss that a bunch of random people in

77
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,600
weird costumes standing outside of

78
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:10,880
government pays that's a

79
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:13,100
once-in-a-lifetime experience it's like

80
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:15,890
Halloween but we are all just annoying

81
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:18,200
people now that's a meme I can get

82
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:20,630
behind guys instead of being mad that

83
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:22,570
the raid wasn't successful wait what do

84
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:25,910
people think it's successful would be

85
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:28,880
there was an actually alien girls with

86
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:31,130
alien [ __ ] the raid wasn't successful

87
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,200
we all could just meet up at area 51

88
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:35,540
every year on September 20th and

89
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:38,240
celebrate it as an internet tradition

90
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:40,550
and flex on all the boomers let's raid

91
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,580
beaches next year and clean them up

92
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:45,620
boomers will be even more confused okay

93
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:50,510

00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:55,640
bong pretty good probably one of the

96
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,260
bigger memes this year it definitely

97
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,540
helped the fact that he had a deadline

98
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:02,600
because all memes are just dead after a

99
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:05,270
week nowadays but thanks to the Facebook

100
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,310

more Alvin Theodore

120
00:05:54,200 --> 00:06:00,680
or Simon the albinus philosophy seems to

121
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:04,040
be occupying the majority of Chipman

122
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,960
inks as a Theodore Ian and myself I must

123
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:08,630
condemn that I do not share my opinions

124
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,970
with such dull minded persons similes

125
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:14,860
could not comprehend

126
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:17,410

129
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:23,920
PB brain if you say they're you're a

130
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:26,410
novelist tiny pea pea brain object Evo

131
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:30,820
no master barmy

132
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:35,320

si taco sombrero okay all right let's

134
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,770
get this out of the way disclaimer the

135
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,020
following essay does not reflect my

136
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:43,240
personal belief and is Mayor proposition

137
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:45,280
that contrasts with the norm belief when

138
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,920
asking the question who is getting the

139
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,370
best head it is important for us to

140
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:52,780
disregard the Chipmunks and Chipettes

141
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:54,760
personalities and characteristics from

142
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:56,770
the equation we do this to avoid

143
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:58,210
confounding varieties that would

144
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:00,460
otherwise make it harder to come up with

145
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:02,740
a clear answer since we are examining a

146
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:05,080
still image we can only form our

147
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:07,900
conclusion based on body language well

148
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:10,480
most interpretations of the image claim

149
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:12,520
that Toki it's theater spoilers it's

150
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:14,050
theater I'm saying it right now it is

151
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:16,030
very frustrating however because we

152
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:18,340
can't know for sure we don't know what

153
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:20,140
subjective experience is and how do we

154
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:22,120
measure it compared to others who's

155
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,770
enjoying them so them selves more what

156
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,140
would you pick tell me honestly right

157
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:28,990
now seriously know me every memes a sign

158
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:31,530
10 million dollars in cash or knowing

00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:33,250
which chipmunk is getting the best head

160
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:35,230
