though they sell for only 1499

16
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,289

filmmaker and I made videos on his

60
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:05,320
previous work in the past which is

61
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:07,650
nothing short of oscar-worthy

62
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:27,900

68
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:43,510
I say Neil is the bass I love this

69
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:46,660
background that he chose it says so much

70
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:48,459
and so little at the same time which is

71
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:50,920
actually a great way to describe his

72
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:52,870
film now a couple a couple of days ago

73
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,700
me and some friends in Brighton we

74
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:57,459
watched it another one of his films one

75
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:59,230
of his older work called the double down

76
00:03:57,459 --> 00:04:03,420
now why don't we double down together

77
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:03,420
and go through this masterpiece

78
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:13,870
Neal Breen psychological thriller Double

79
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,250
Down it's a masterpiece I'm not gonna

80
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:17,109
lie it's a little light it's a little

81
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,880
hard to sit through there are some

82
00:04:17,109 --> 00:04:21,970
moments I'm questioning why I watch this

83
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,440
film but there are those golden moments

84
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:26,169
and that's what we're gonna focus on

85
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,570
today's so the film starts up with this

86
00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:31,500
lovely footage of clouds and you think

87
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:34,300
wow this actually looks pretty great I

88
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:36,520
like the music it's made by Neal Green

89
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:38,770
we don't know what Neal brain has done

90
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:41,620
but we know that he is involved in this

91
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:43,630
field there's now I know what you're

92
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:46,330
asking yourself will there be another

93
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:48,400
Neal green text on the screen please I

94
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:50,919

95
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,310
screen don't worry it is coming there's

96
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:56,620
got to be patient because this video

97
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:58,630
because this film has to be in our 30

98
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:00,400
minutes so that it can be quite where

99
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:03,190
producers writen and directed by Neil

100
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,199

being an excessive use of laptops Neil

Breen loves to use laptops why use one

144
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:47,090
laptop when he's can use two laps down

145
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:48,830

really glad that laptop has made it an

158
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:43,540
apparent here as well

159
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:48,550

never end he's talking about t-series

163
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:58,780
vs. PewDiePie that's right I snuck that

164
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:01,540
one in there so Neil Green is basically

165
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:02,200
like an undercover agent type of really

166
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:05,380
hard to explain

167
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:09,750
Neil brain character is like a super

168
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:11,310
rogue agent to secret war underground

169
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:15,130
desert-dwelling

170
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:20,740
character I disappear he can disappear

171
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:22,210
home and he also has a force field which

172
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:24,400
is pretty much filled with cause for

173
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:26,260
shield sir if an intruder the force

174
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,240
shield will cause death if an intruder

175
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:29,800
draws near just letting you guys know

176
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,870
that that's the thing that Neil Breen

177
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,910
has this is important for the plot and

178
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:37,030
story no it isn't but that is not

179
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:43,630
necessary in Neil Breen's films okay you

180
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:45,430
just don't understand three laptops at

181
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:47,260
the same time port or truth

182
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:51,760
how many laptops do you use at the same

183
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:54,340
time huh one two threes but there's no

184
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,950

00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:06,010

189
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:09,520

190
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:11,620
climber and an excellent athleticism but

191
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:13,480

00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:15,910

196
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:25,740
this video what is he finding

197
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:35,440
another laptop everyone the fifth laptop

198
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:35,440
makes this appearance

199
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:44,500
yep that's a laptop yep

200
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:46,670
confirmed it is in fact a laptop

201
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:49,580
remember we were seven and it was love

202
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:52,310
at first sight we loved each other since

203
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:55,490
because you have matching pants is that

204
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:59,960
why Neal there he is again with the

205
00:09:55,490 --> 00:10:02,930
laptops now to be clear here we are 17

206
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:06,770
minutes into the film and we haven't

207
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:09,950
seen or heard any dialogue whatsoever

208
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:12,320
it's just been nothing but this and Neal

209
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:14,690
Breen talking over the footage there was

210
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:18,530
an error in the calculation okay all

211
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:21,440
right but let's go to the best fit in my

212
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:23,690
opinion of the entire film it starts off

213
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:29,450
with the footage of a very public pool

214
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:31,430
as you can see here then cut to Neal

215
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:38,950
brain beam naked in this pool with naked

216
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:45,040
lady I love you will you marry me yes

217
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:45,040
yes yes I will marry

218
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:05,070
you can tell she really feels strongly

219
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:08,340
about this clip now I definitely want to

220
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:11,550

221
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:17,040

00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:20,840

I cannot recreate that fantastic sound

232
00:11:56,390 --> 00:12:09,020
only one man jeez that is the shriek of

233
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:11,750
pure agony now if you thought this whole

234
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:15,040
scenario was obscure enough I guess we

235
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:15,040
it gets a spear

236
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:28,360

00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:53,260
yes thank you very much Neil Breen for

240
00:12:46,520 --> 00:13:01,520

241
00:12:53,260 --> 00:13:17,089
art and he's gone oh okay there he is

242
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:18,920
I find myself waking up on the ground PJ

243
00:13:17,089 --> 00:13:21,260
pointed out this when we watched at it

244
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:23,720
it's like we see him waking up from the

245
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:25,880
ground we don't need him I'm sorry Nia I

246
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,310
don't think what he need him pointing

247
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:30,800
out that he's waking up from the ground

248
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:33,290
as much as I love the soothing sound of

249
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:36,200
Neil Greene's buttery voice just just a

250
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:38,930
thought the whole plot of the film kind

251
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:41,120
of sounds like Neil Greene's personal

252
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:43,490
thoughts I don't know how to explain it

253
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,500
but showing this I'm always amazed that

254
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:47,930
how governments all over the world are

255
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:51,380
so concerned about nuclear missiles and

256
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:54,520
nuclear bombs and all the very expensive

257
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:57,610
and secret technology involved

258
00:13:54,520 --> 00:14:00,250
the reality is that chemical and

259
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:02,730
biological weapons can be much more

260
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:05,950
destructive to societies and economies

261
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:07,839
in nuclear weapons all right Alex Jones

262
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:12,360
all right thank you appreciate it

263
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:15,580
oh he's laying on the ground again

264
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:17,529
now wait what just happened did he wake

265
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:19,720
up or did he find himself waking up in

266
00:14:17,529 --> 00:14:23,339
the ground is that what happened Neil

267
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,339
you're not explaining what's going on

268
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:35,250

269
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:38,190

I've received their directions now

271
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:46,029
introducing the greatest character of

272
00:14:40,899 --> 00:14:48,520
all time Neil Breen is walking through

273
00:14:46,029 --> 00:14:52,209
the desert in the middle of nowhere and

274
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:56,500
he stumbles upon none other than desert

275
00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:58,089
Santa desert Santa everyone he sits in

276
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:01,029
the desert I don't know what desert

277
00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:03,640
Santa does now unfortunately don't get

278
00:15:01,029 --> 00:15:06,430
too attached to desert Santa I know as I

279
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:12,279
love him dearly as well but deserts

280
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:14,709

what is desert Santa gonna do follow him

287
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,930
there's no way desert Santa can follow

288
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:51,810
him that was some way too tricky of a

289
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:54,720
path no one could ever do that no one

290
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:57,740
has to parkour skills to follow neoprene

291
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,740
in the desert

292
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:11,620
Neal Breen knows this of course no no it

293
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:13,720
was a goddamn me he shouldn't have tried

294
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:17,250
to follow neoprene the path was too

295
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:23,590
strict he got outplayed desert Santa

296
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:25,780
outplayed son I was drawn to him I felt

297
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:28,600
I knew his spirit now this is actually a

298
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:32,830
love story between Neal and desert Santa

299
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:35,980
which is quite tear breaking the blood

300
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:40,240
is gone from his head but he's still

301
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:40,800
dying what are you saying deserts ain't

302
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:46,030

303
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:48,570

304
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:48,570
he gave him

305
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:57,090
[Music]

306
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:57,090
the desert santa stone

307
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,879
[Music]

308
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:08,090
that's a nice shot and that's a nice

309
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:09,170
Barrett you just just put some rock over

310
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:12,680
him he'll be fine

311
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:13,720
he gets he's alive he's just sleeping in

312
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:16,910
his rocker babe

313
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:20,210
then we have Neela visiting his parents

314
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:25,730
I guess I don't I don't know what's

315
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:31,040
happening here I like this I like this

316
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:38,480
shot it's kind of aesthetic dad it's

317
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:41,870
like a good wallpaper we are filled with

318
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,410
love and we are at peace well that's

319
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:44,360
nice

320
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:46,910
so apparently even if you're dead you

321
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:49,460
can still not properly walk in it still

322
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:52,210
hurts to walk on gravel and stone how

323
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:54,800
about that hey that just looks painful

324
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:57,070
all that we do is drive around and get

325
00:17:54,800 --> 00:18:00,170
caught up in spectacular car chases and

326
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:03,530
dude buildings blowing up and wild

327
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:05,540
gunfire and so on that only happens in

328
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:09,260
the movies and on TV it really doesn't

329
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:12,280
happen in real life in a real life

330
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:17,090
everything we do is done very silently

331
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:18,950
undercover and electronically the public

332
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:22,400

387
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:09,900

394
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:35,550
opportunity to marry neoprene and it

395
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,350
only lasted five seconds gosh damn it

396
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:39,690
ten seconds well at least you

397
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:45,690
experienced those 10 seconds of pure joy

398
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:50,340
and bliss and love I'm pretty sure Neil

399
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:51,810
isn't supposed to need that skull but I

400
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:53,490
like the touch anyway

401
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:58,620
Hey look it's more Neil running in the

402
00:21:53,490 --> 00:22:00,950

00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:24,550
oh excuse me contact so relatable I

407
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,260
think that's why I like his films

408
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:29,160
they're just really able another

409
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:31,930
reoccurring theme in needle spoons that

410
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:35,470
Ferraris that's right is that the sake

411
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:37,380

413
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:42,760
he just took Jim's Ferrari he loved that

414
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:44,800
car I don't know if there's any point of

415
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:46,840
me explaining what's going on I think

416
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:49,240
it's better to just appreciate these

417
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:58,980

418
00:22:49,240 --> 00:23:04,690

00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,750

422
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:18,880
tuna cans

423
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:21,940
does he recycle them or does he just

424
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:24,190
have a cardboard box in his trunk

425
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:26,260
where he keeps all the tuna cans and I'm

426
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:29,170
just really glad that we finally had the

427
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:31,420
answer what happens to all the tuna cans

428
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:34,570

429
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:36,550
unanswered now of course in the end we

430
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:38,820

00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:38,820
