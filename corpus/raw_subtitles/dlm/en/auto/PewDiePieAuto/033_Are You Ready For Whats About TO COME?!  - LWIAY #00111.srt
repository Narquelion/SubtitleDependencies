the bottom it's got a distinct style

19
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,090
it's actually harder for an artist to

20
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,500
draw surrealistic instead of realistic

21
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:10,470

other weather-related incidents have a

154
00:07:05,419 --> 00:07:10,400
lot of effect on how we manage the

155
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:12,949
forest and so often we need new plans

156
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,479
because the forest did not get as old as

157
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:16,970

00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,410
