00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:09,059
go go go go go go go bhaga bhaga bhaga

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:21,660
good evening i'm pop it's more iya the

3
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:23,930
new news anchor a few news our first

4
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,689
story comes from YouTube YouTube is

5
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:29,340
canceled that's right YouTube is fine

6
00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:32,550
170 million dollars for collecting

7
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:34,649
children's personal data big oopsie very

8
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:37,440
large oopsie by YouTube they have to see

9
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:39,450
fine Google 136 million they are forced

10
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,840
to pay an additional 34 million to the

11
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:44,040
state of New York why I don't know

12
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,020
because they collect their children's

13
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,910
personal data this is actually an old

14
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,129
story that happened back in September

15
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,180
but now it looks like it's affecting

16
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:52,890
everyone

17
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,750
every single person on the platform it's

18
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,370
pretty nuts I didn't think it was a big

19
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,989
deal at first but the more I look into

20
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:59,129
it the more I realize this is actually a

21
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:01,050
huge deal

22
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:02,730
YouTube has previously said that it's

23
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:04,379
for 13 years and older if you sign up

24
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,510
for YouTube you can't do it unless

25
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,880
you're over 13 I don't know exactly how

26
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:11,040
it works but they have the kids app for

27
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,500
people younger than 13 because it's

28
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,210
illegal to collect personal data on kids

29
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,340
that's how YouTube gets their

30
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:19,860
advertising revenue that's how I make my

31
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:22,020
money because you get targeted ads based

32
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,880
on personal data which are obviously

33
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,040
much more worth than I don't know

34
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,509
normal ads I guess that's Google's whole

35
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,450
business model if you didn't know that

36
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:32,759
well I don't know what to tell you

37
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:35,850
so what the government of you would say

38
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,439
even though it's American base it still

39
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:40,350
applies the worldwide because obviously

40
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,329
YouTube is located in America America

41
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,829
has this government-run facility called

42
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:45,750
the FTC I don't know if this is correct

43
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:47,640
but they have this I don't know what

44
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:49,380
they call it an act called Coppa which

45
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,720
is Children's Online Privacy Protection

46
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,430
Act and it's to protect kids online

47
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,680
which makes sense you know I don't think

48
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,750
collecting kids data is good I don't

49
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,610
want that no one is arguing for that and

50
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,619
I think it's really confusing to me

51
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:03,719
because obviously YouTube has the kids

52
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:05,460
app so what's the issue I assume what

53
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:07,020
happened was that YouTube created kids

54
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,940
app and said okay well this is where all

55
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,950
the kids goes but then FTC comes back

56
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,050
and be like actually you know what kids

57
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:15,150
are still watching YouTube on you too

58
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:17,550
this is not enough and that's why they

59
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:19,710
got the fine but then again why is it

60
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:22,890
youtubes fault that your kid is going

61
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:25,020
online decision American take on things

62
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,160
it's never the parents fault it's always

63
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,800
someone else's fault

64
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,660
so now what every YouTube creator has to

65
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,400
do is they have to make a choice when

66
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:34,680
they upload a video saying what's this

67
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,540
video made specifically for kids or was

68
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,280
it not made specifically for kids and

69
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,900
YouTube uploaded this video to instruct

70
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,480
about you create content for YouTube

71
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,250
this video is very important to watch as

72
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,860
it describes changes to the upload

73
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:49,680
process all of your existing videos and

74
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,820
potentially your monetization so what

75
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,140
you have to do now so you have to go

76
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:54,780
into your advanced settings and you can

77
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:57,600
say no my videos isn't made for kids

78
00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:00,090
epic okay fine that's almost a problem

79
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,220
right now YouTube knows in addition to

80
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:04,560
this setting will use machine learning

81
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:06,630
systems to help us find content that is

82
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,860
clearly made for kids that's cool

83
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:09,720
machine learning has always worked

84
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:13,410
really well in YouTube is this like the

85
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:14,820
opposite hahaha apocalypse before you

86
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:16,740
kiddin make edgy constant now you're not

87
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:19,770
allowed to make family-friendly content

88
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:21,480
it's so confusing well regardless you

89
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:24,140
know it seemed like the liability was on

90
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:26,370
YouTube YouTube is getting fine

91
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:28,890
mm-hmm-hmm Federal Trade Commission made

92
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:31,110
a statement and it's pretty shiny ology

93
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:32,459
that I think of is the expression about

94
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:34,260
shooting fish in a barrel

95
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:36,570
YouTube is the barrel and the content

96
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,280
creators are the fish did he just say

97
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:40,140
he's gonna shoot us there will be

98
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,670
consequences Jesus Christ this guy is

99
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:45,360
terrifying there will be consequence

100
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:48,300
what did I do we have a variety of tools

101
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,730
at our disposal to cull through those 23

102
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:52,770
million channels and in an expeditious

103
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:55,560
way so when we talk about what does that

104
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:58,760
mean we are typically talking about

105
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:01,320
civil penalties not only can we sue

106
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:04,290
Google and YouTube for compliance with

107
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:07,260
Coppa but also individual channel owners

108
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:11,160
and content creators cool so not only

109
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:14,709
can they sue YouTube they can sue people

110
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:20,180
that upload content online

111
00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:22,699
why my what that makes no sense control

112
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:24,500
your children please so I think the

113
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:26,780
maximum that FCC can sue you for is

114
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,280
fifty forty two thousand that's what I

115
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:30,680
heard at least but that's per video

116
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:33,889
basis I have five thousand videos on my

117
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:37,100
channel if twenty four videos get deemed

118
00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:39,410
by FTC is targeted for kids then I own

119
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:41,090
them one million dollars epic I forgot

120
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:44,270
to mention so what happens if a video

121
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:46,180
gets made flag made for kids the video

122
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:48,680
will not get recommended by other videos

123
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:50,300
most of the revenue will be a removed

124
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,620
from sixty to ninety percent of the

125
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,870
revenue is just caught off completely

126
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:55,490
and all the comments will be removed

127
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:57,320
from that video as well I mean when I

128
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:59,660
first heard about I was like oh well I

129
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,460
never purposely made content for kids I

130
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:03,620
never try and direct my content for kids

131
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:06,050
but then at the same time YouTube now

132
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:08,240
has changed their format so you can't

133
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:10,729
swear edgy content is really not allowed

134
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,349
so you're kind of forced to be

135
00:05:10,729 --> 00:05:13,729
family-friendly but now it seems you're

136
00:05:12,349 --> 00:05:16,370
getting punished for it you could

137
00:05:13,729 --> 00:05:18,530
possibly get a lawsuit it's so crazy

138
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:20,270
and then first again at first my initial

139
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:22,849
reaction was like yeah you know what if

140
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:25,789
I understand FTC there's a lot of

141
00:05:22,849 --> 00:05:27,979
clearly 100% clearly in my opinion

142
00:05:25,789 --> 00:05:30,050
content that is made for kids on the

143
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:32,979
platform which is very profitable and

144
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:36,139
very very lucrative I mean you got

145
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:40,070
morgues I can't see anyone over the age

146
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:41,330
of 12 watching morgues and it's always

147
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:43,190
kind of weird like why is that on

148
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:44,870
YouTube why is that not on the kids app

149
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:47,000
isn't that what the kids have is for

150
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:49,280
right in case you didn't know this the

151
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,349
most profitable channel on YouTube is

152
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,780
Ryan's toy review which is a

153
00:05:51,349 --> 00:05:56,389
seven-year-old unboxing toys that's

154
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:59,570
clearly made for kids okay no add up

155
00:05:56,389 --> 00:06:01,370
that let that's an obvious case in my

156
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:03,199
opinion what the finding is we are

157
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:04,940
inside a PC Knights part he's passed out

158
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,880
in the back Regina what did you do I

159
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:09,860
didn't you got until Battle Royale with

160
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,340
a bunch of huggers and they did this to

161
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:13,960
him

162
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:15,760
I don't see anyone over the age to tell

163
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,770
watching this is either sorry chat but I

164
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,690
think he knows these are clearly made

165
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:21,490
for kids right and it always weirded me

166
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:23,200
out and even Jake Paul you know I

167
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:24,640
remember a nerd seated it did a really

168
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,490
good video on this where he showed just

169
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:30,540
how Jake Paul is marketing to kids all

170
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:33,190
these colored areas is him talking about

171
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:35,320
plug for different merchandise and

172
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:37,690
different products and touring this is

173
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:40,590
all promos for kids and Jake Paul

174
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:42,970
himself even said what his audience is

175
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:45,400
I'd say it's like eight years old to

176
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:49,420
like 16 years old and so that's why okay

177
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:51,760
ladies and gentlemen we got him a fake

178
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:53,290
now here's what he changed for me

179
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,510
because YouTube is already starting to

180
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:57,580
strike down on videos and and flagging

181
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:59,410
them as kit for kids only and by the way

182
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:01,660
what happens if the video gets flagged

183
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:03,400
for kids only or specifically made for

184
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,900
kids it means you get caught up from

185
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,420
recommended you're not allowed to read

186
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:09,040
the comments anymore and most of your

187
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:10,570
revenue is gonna go away probably

188
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,860
between sixty to ninety percent of your

189
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:14,020
revenue is gonna be gone

190
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:16,960
so it's hits a pretty significant change

191
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:18,610
it's hitting people that I don't think

192
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,950
deserve it like this channel for example

193
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:23,620
pixel ban his content was flagged by it

194
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:26,440
he does figurines he shows figurines old

195
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:28,390
toys it doesn't strike me as for kids at

196
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:31,180
all when I watched it but I guess since

197
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:32,830
his toys that makes it liable and that

198
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:37,020
shows kind of where the line is drawn on

199
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:40,300
he tweeted that his Watchmen figurine

200
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:42,880
was made for kids his South Park series

201
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,410
made for kids South Park's I was really

202
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,570
wrong I'm like oh so it's not for kids

203
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:48,190
no way it is they specified it for kids

204
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:50,950
obviously YouTube is gonna do wrong but

205
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:53,170
at the same time goddamn this really

206
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:56,920
shows and it's not just him there was

207
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:59,860
another figurine channel Jang bricks for

208
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:01,600
example who just like Lego builds adults

209
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,880
can enjoy this stuff I enjoy this stuff

210
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,500
it's like máximo fooders Pokemon a card

211
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,450
autoboxing he's clearly not made for

212
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:10,270
kids but it wouldn't surprise me if he

213
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:12,160
gets flying as well delightful who made

214
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:13,900
the point of why am I supposed to swear

215
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,470
now is that what's happening because I'm

216
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:19,780
doing four dull videos it again

217
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:21,430
sure may be kids watching but how is

218
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:22,790
that hurtful they're clearly not

219
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:24,620
directed to kids at least

220
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:26,510
not the vibe I got artistic preference

221
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:28,100
of course but I prefer exaggerated or

222
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:29,810
simplified characters faces -

223
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:32,210
realistically sculpted one so seeing

224
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:33,950
that is this it makes it very very very

225
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:35,720
annoying even cypher dentists well who's

226
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:36,919
done animation on my channel they are on

227
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:39,470
my channel

228
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:41,960
they got flat as made for kids what

229
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:44,000
because it's a cartoon because it's

230
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:46,600
animation think about all the animators

231
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,840
on YouTube now are they gonna like

232
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,330
YouTube

233
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:56,120
don't make edgy content also YouTube

234
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:58,070
don't make family-friendly content feels

235
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,840
like a joke at this point I think jack

236
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:01,750
is a good example too cuz I think people

237
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,770
have this idea that Jack is

238
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:05,600
family-friendly or because he plays

239
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:07,840
games or whatever but in reality he

240
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:11,330
swears a lot he drops a freaking C word

241
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:13,250
or is FTC gonna be able to see that

242
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:15,740
nuance and be like oh well he plays

243
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:17,630
minecraft so adults can enjoy kids games

244
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,890
it's not a kids game kids just like it

245
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:20,660
that's not my fault

246
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:22,190
me when I rewatched PewDiePie videos and

247
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,900
forgot he used to swear line yeah I

248
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:25,850
stopped swearing in my videos and since

249
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:27,470
it's my bread and butter if I upload it

250
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:29,060
once a month and had like a brand deal

251
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:31,370
yeah it wouldn't matter but I'm not

252
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:33,680
gonna lose revenue just to say [ __ ] it

253
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:35,150
just seems so stupid but now it's my

254
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,160
minecraft video who's gonna again I

255
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:39,590
don't understand another thing I have

256
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:41,810
figurine an unboxing collection I don't

257
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:44,060
think it's for kids but looking at how

258
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:45,920
YouTube is looking at these videos how

259
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:47,750
do you respond to that it feels like I'm

260
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,550
supposed to hit this is made for kids

261
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:51,380
even though I don't think it is and then

262
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:52,910
if FTC says oh by the way you flagged

263
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:54,590
this as for kids we're gonna sue you or

264
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:56,720
whatever I know this is a problem

265
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:58,580
improbable thing that will happen but

266
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,460
still it would make me legally liable

267
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:03,020
ISA if I flag it for kids right because

268
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:05,180
that's admitting guilt that's admitting

269
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:06,260
yo yeah no I think you're right when I

270
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:08,180
don't think it's right so I'm just

271
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:10,190
forced to remove this video instead

272
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,990
that's like the only thing I know how to

273
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:13,730
deal with this I love this to eat me

274
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:15,700
trying to make roblox videos for fun the

275
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:18,890
FTC stop right there criminal scum

276
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:21,320
nobody breaks the law and my watch I'm

277
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:24,230
confiscating your stolen goods now pay

278
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:25,790
your fine or it's off to jail there's

279
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:27,830
Ryan's tour review and then there's

280
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:29,930
people making content that kids maybe

281
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:32,180
enjoys what the hell are they supposed

282
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:34,430
to do about that it makes no sense and

283
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:35,779
it's only also saw this tweet honestly

284
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:37,399
the whole thing is backwards

285
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:39,769
access the common suggestion - a user

286
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:43,069
should be done on a per account basis

287
00:10:39,769 --> 00:10:44,990
not her video basis yes thank you

288
00:10:43,069 --> 00:10:46,670
there's so many channels on YouTube that

289
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:49,819
make really good family-friendly content

290
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:51,110
is that not a thing anymore and I think

291
00:10:49,819 --> 00:10:53,269
it's one of these things where we just

292
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:55,069
gonna have to wait and see and and see

293
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:56,809
how FTC enforces this if you're a

294
00:10:55,069 --> 00:10:59,089
smaller Channel I wouldn't I guess I

295
00:10:56,809 --> 00:11:01,399
don't know I know one thing for sure is

296
00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:03,100
for sure what's up my 19 year olds

297
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:06,100
that's right your 19 year old now

298
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,100
congratulations

299
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:12,170
dammit I can't believe it

300
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:15,230
they grow up so fast you can comment on

301
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:17,990
this proposition and leave your feedback

302
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:20,449
if you want to I love this by the way in

303
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:23,809
in their presentation as example slang

304
00:11:20,449 --> 00:11:29,990
and pop-culture phrases such as fun free

305
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:33,709
stuff whatever cool duh duh you know I

306
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:36,019
use ironic family-friendly jokes in my

307
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:38,180
in my minecraft series like clip clop

308
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:40,610
and I say all this like childish work

309
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:43,009
words as a joke are they gonna be able

310
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:46,069
to tell that I don't know stop why is

311
00:11:43,009 --> 00:11:47,420
YouTube air always like this always can

312
00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:49,550
you imagine these channels that are

313
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:52,100
making like figurine or Lego or whatever

314
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:53,870

next news oh my god if I go on Twitter

318
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:02,629
this is what I see these anime avatar

319
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:05,029
kids are just absolutely relentlessly

320
00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:07,189
calling me i trans folk on Twitter I

321
00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:09,259
like this person with the most retweets

322
00:12:07,189 --> 00:12:13,819
who then admitted no I didn't watch the

323
00:12:09,259 --> 00:12:16,100
video epic so why am i transform well

324
00:12:13,819 --> 00:12:18,620
because I allegedly purposely

325
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:20,660
misgendered someone it was in my dr.

326
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:22,220
Phil video Zoomer thinks his mom is too

327
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:24,319
irrelevant this video I got claim by the

328
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:28,550
way r.i.p i'm glad we went through all

329
00:12:24,319 --> 00:12:31,309
this extensive effort to try and try and

330
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:33,709
get it monetize regardless this person

331
00:12:31,309 --> 00:12:37,040
who to me so clearly was a jeffree star

332
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:39,079
wannabe or look-alike or inspired

333
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,459
whatever and I honestly I don't even

334
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:42,559
think about it because she had a

335
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:43,429
masculine name her name was Bama and and

336
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:46,009
I looked it up

337
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:48,079
BAM Aaron is a boy's name so he's not

338
00:12:46,009 --> 00:12:49,190
that weird to think they would be

339
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,840
referred as a he

340
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:53,090
and she wasn't mentioned as she anywhere

341
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:55,250
by anyone in the video so it's not that

342
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:56,690
weird if I did I would have noticed and

343
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,620
I would have changed it but no I'm a

344
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:59,690
transfer okay

345
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:01,520
did you not know that I didn't watch the

346
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:03,980
video but PewDiePie is a transform I

347
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:06,200
know what his intent is at every point

348
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:08,540
you know I actually support LGBT I would

349
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:10,610
never and I could have been more careful

350
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:12,440
but I would never purposely misgender

351
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:14,060
someone as a way to antagonize her troll

352
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,520
like but I wouldn't do that same with

353
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:18,410
sexuality that's not that's not okay you

354
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,910
shouldn't do it either I wouldn't do it

355
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:22,640
