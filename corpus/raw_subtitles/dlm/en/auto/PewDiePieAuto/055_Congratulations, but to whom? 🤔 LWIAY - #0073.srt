the well soon in the comments you know

8
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,079
the thing about having no attention to

9
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:36,570
quality with your videos is that it

10
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,670

11
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:42,149

15
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:49,079
funny thing is with that song was that

16
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:51,690
we made it with the intention that

17
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,879
t-series were gonna pass us so we rushed

18
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:57,210
this video out so quickly

19
00:00:53,879 --> 00:01:00,300
Joel flew in from LA stayed for like ten

20
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:02,789
hours we spent I don't know 12 14 hours

21
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:05,729
straight just filming the video and then

22
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:08,369
he flew back home and then it took four

23
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:09,930
months four teasers to pass so we had

24
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:12,180
all the time in the world to make this

25
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:14,820
video but I'm glad we finally got to

26
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:17,490
release it and it means we are winning

27
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:20,130

back there were like 200,000 away

71
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:00,840

72
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,290
world where are we finding the last ones

73
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:07,050
we should stop calling t-series t gay

74
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:10,740
gay people don't deserve to be compared

75
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:13,080
to such filth I think people should stop

76
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:14,400
calling T gay regardless it's like one

77
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,770
of those things where it's clearly just

78
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,570
an ironic insult but it wouldn't

79
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:20,520
surprise me if the media picks up on it

80
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:22,530
and goes like Opie PI's family they're

81
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,090
all Helmer phobic look they're calling

82
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:26,820
them T gay this is so awful

83
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:29,640
plus it's just kind of stupid I'd say

84
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:32,430
we'd call them T bad that's right that's

85
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:35,070
a real insult T bad you can't recover

86
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:38,370

00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:56,630
Twitter bot signed off t-series have

148
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,970
been in the lead for 24 hours

149
00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:04,340
Felix doesn't care anymore did we just

150
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:06,710
lose oh no oh no the media peopIe hates

151
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:09,410
Indian people 55 fans what about the

152
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:11,990
time he donated 246,000 towards Indian

153
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:14,060
charity the media did the past really

154
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:16,160
happen why do we have to bring out a

155
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:17,930
balanced view of a person when we can

156
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,480
just solely focus on the negative bids

157
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:23,330
why should the media be unbiased and

158
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:25,970
unpark it reminds me of the in the song

159
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:28,330
we have this line where it's like we

160
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:31,640
wanted to come up with the dumbest line

161
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:33,730
possibly you could make about someone to

162
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:36,750
not be offended and it's this one

163
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:39,910
[Music]

164
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,910
[Applause]

165
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:46,229
people are actually genuinely upset over

166
00:06:44,609 --> 00:06:49,559
that line because they take it out of

167
00:06:46,229 --> 00:06:52,049
context like Jesus Christ when is it

168
00:06:49,559 --> 00:06:53,699
gonna stop just stop taking things out

169
00:06:52,049 --> 00:06:55,739
of context what's the point

170
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:57,299
you just look stupid I just find it

171
00:06:55,739 --> 00:06:59,099
funny because in Dave's video we're

172
00:06:57,299 --> 00:07:15,179
literally like no one's gonna get mad

173
00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:18,959
about that of course you can just take

174
00:07:15,179 --> 00:07:20,969
it out of context so dumb the first and

175
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:23,459
last brofist is that is that my first

176
00:07:20,969 --> 00:07:26,429
brofist did someone find the first I'm

177
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:29,099

hey more lines to reference yay here's

184
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:43,110
one last brofist from the number one in

185
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:45,089
the world it's been an honor

186
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:47,279
I would always skip past this part when

187
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:49,499
I watch the video cuz I I just find it

188
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:51,389
so cringy but I'm glad a lot of people

189
00:07:49,499 --> 00:07:52,019
got something emotional out of it at

190
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:53,999
least

191
00:07:52,019 --> 00:07:56,339
yeah who would have thought the brofist

192
00:07:53,999 --> 00:07:58,079
actually has so much emotional impact on

193
00:07:56,339 --> 00:08:00,119
people the brofist has kind of become

194
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:01,709
like minecraft at this point it's

195
00:08:00,119 --> 00:08:04,169
something that people used to do and

196
00:08:01,709 --> 00:08:06,389
then it kind of became overly popular

197
00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:08,789
and kind of cringy and then taken over

198
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:10,860
by kids and then now it's sort of

199
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:13,319
working its way back again to where it

200
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,909
actually has a stronger bond because you

201
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:17,699
associated with the certain nostalgia

202
00:08:14,909 --> 00:08:18,299
it's just me or is that just what I

203
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:20,129
think

204
00:08:18,299 --> 00:08:22,199
okay sometimes I put my mouse cursor

205
00:08:20,129 --> 00:08:24,299
over Felix cursor and pretend we're

206
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:26,219
