their role is simple I am in a

34
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,470
self-defense scenario for legal reasons

35
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:43,200
they're attacking to you of course they

36
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:45,899
are attacking me I did nothing wrong but

37
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:50,070
I am forced to defend myself okay right

38
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:52,799
right whereas I have the rightful choice

39
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:55,290
as to go all the way you know all the

40
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,149
way to execute or if I want to just

41
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:58,619

character hard right like select your

59
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:42,890
fighter weaknesses 9 you already filled

60
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:44,569

61
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:49,130

00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:56,360
than Morsy is and very tall all right so

65
00:02:54,470 --> 00:03:00,110
I'm not the most built person in the

66
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:02,600
world fine I'll admit but good slender

67
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:05,230

00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:15,430
yeah you quick quick witted maybe no

72
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:17,840
yeah I like that

73
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:18,470
like the Cerebral Assassin you get in

74
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,780
their heads

75
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:23,239
you make them overthinking attack that's

76
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:25,340
right thank you all right weakness can

77
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:27,829
we agree on no no I can't agree on that

78
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,790
we have like you already filled out none

79
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:31,070
as your weakness

80
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:32,870
I can't tell people my wig fits the

81
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:34,579
maybe you're overconfident maybe you're

82
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:40,430
just a little overconfident yeah all

83
00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:44,090
right maybe we'll put maybe maybe can't

84
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:47,329
type a little over confident

85
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:49,640
just little x okay okay all right now we

86
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:53,600
have that filled out let's get into the

87
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:54,859
duel yeah Logan Paul here's bigger than

88
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,630
me I'll give him that

89
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:59,329
maybe tiny bit stronger than me I'll

90
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:01,400
give him a little bit maybe which kind

91
00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:03,440
of puts him over here and then you

92
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:06,400
realize you know would Logan Paul kill

93
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:09,829
me he has an affinity for dead people so

94
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:13,430
absolutely he would kill me and then

95
00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:14,840
film it too on top of that oh that's the

96
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:17,450
thing that I think will make me

97
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,579
persevere I will be in last stand like

98
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:21,739
Call of Duty I will be in fetal position

99
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:23,840
Yeah right right I'll be like oh god no

100
00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:25,340
I can't let Logan Paul kill me that

101
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,389
would be the worst thing possible I

102
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,280
think I heard somewhere

103
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:30,110
has like 15% of his testicles or

104
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,969
something like that I have no idea I

105
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:35,409
don't know any more about testicles and

106
00:04:31,969 --> 00:04:40,009
I do yeah I do because I started my

107
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:43,340
course I said fetal position grab those

108
00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:45,650
last 50 percent and he drops down to

109
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:47,389
fair fight ah airFiber

110
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:48,620
probably it's hard for my called the

111
00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:50,389
boss and traitors and all that stuff

112
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,889
he's doing do you'd have you'd have that

113
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:54,650
advantage right oh that's right I think

114
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:56,360
that actually puts me there thank you I

115
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:57,770
mean you'd be on the ground he'd be

116
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,389
going for the kill shot that he's also

117
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:00,560
like you know turn into a screw making

118
00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:02,419
sure they're getting the shot on camera

119
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,419
and during that moment you just grab

120
00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:09,069
them and drop them down position to be

121
00:05:05,419 --> 00:05:09,069
fair though I will die in the process

122
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:18,020
I'll bleed out but it'll be worth it and

123
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,300
again I want to point out self-defense

124
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:22,189
self-defense right now I think I feel

125
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:25,279
like in that scenario everyone wins you

126
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:29,120
went out epically no but he also got a

127
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:31,580
dead body in his all right he got he got

128
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,560
he got scars to remember me I I like

129
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:34,639
that PewDiePie grabbed him by the nuts I

130
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:39,110
mean who wouldn't be a winner in that

131
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:42,860
situation I say all right next up Shane

132
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:46,069
Dawson Dean Dawson yeah all right good

133
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:48,830
eye it begs the question how tall is

134
00:05:46,069 --> 00:05:50,690
Shane Dawson I don't know I have no idea

135
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:54,409
he looks like he's at least seven foot

136
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:57,349
tall he looks so Thomas videos 183 what

137
00:05:54,409 --> 00:06:02,229
is that that's like a half a dozen way

138
00:05:57,349 --> 00:06:05,389
taller than me he's 510 Brett all right

139
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:07,250
okay you're so tall I did watch one

140
00:06:05,389 --> 00:06:09,439
Shane Austin video where he was working

141
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:11,029
out for like 15 minutes I think that

142
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:13,129
puts him an advantage over me as well

143
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:15,349
right actually working out there that's

144
00:06:13,129 --> 00:06:17,659
that takes a lot of effort I also think

145
00:06:15,349 --> 00:06:19,699
Shane Dawson has secret hidden strength

146
00:06:17,659 --> 00:06:21,740
inside him that will put him in an

147
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:24,979
advantage right right right been through

148
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:26,810
a lot in his lifetime he knows he has

149
00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:29,419
experience yeah he has experience he's

150
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:32,689
been through it however quick that's

151
00:06:29,419 --> 00:06:34,520
right I'm quick I'm drop I know Shane's

152
00:06:32,689 --> 00:06:36,919
weakness I'll drop some trivia about him

153
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,690
yeah some trivia that is gonna blow his

154
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:39,919
mind like Shane the floor is made of

155
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:42,710
floor

156
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:45,020
Shayne will be distracted I'll go for

157
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:47,419
the I won't go for the nuts but I'll go

158
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:49,219
first I'll go for his liver go for his

159
00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:50,449
liver okay yeah you tell him that and it

160
00:06:49,219 --> 00:06:51,979
like starts playing like the intense

161
00:06:50,449 --> 00:06:54,650
music and zooming in on his face he's

162
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:56,840
just like shaking his head like he's

163
00:06:54,650 --> 00:07:00,020
drop-kicking from the side yeah yeah yes

164
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:02,330
when he least expected um I wouldn't

165
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:04,039
deliver the final blow however I'll put

166
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:06,740
him somewhere here no I think he just

167
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:08,270
needs to learn a lesson right okay yeah

168
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:14,449
I'll just do something weird like spit

169
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:16,400
in his mouth or something you gotta make

170
00:07:14,449 --> 00:07:18,020
sure they didn't come at you again just

171
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,250
still one of his shoes or something so

172
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,849

yeah the car I'm completely not

260
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:35,950
responsible but there was going to be a

261
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:37,270
pool of lava underneath don't do that to

262
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:37,690
that poor lava that by lava didn't

263
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:40,480
deserve that

264
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:41,020
poor lava I've seen the Chad for the

265
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,360
lava

266
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:45,340
all right so Tana and Oh actually I

267
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,170
think Moritz as well classifiers in this

268
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:49,420
category where they're the kind of

269
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:51,550
youtubers that they don't die like I can

270
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:53,260
try and dip them in a pit of lava they

271
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:55,570
would come back they always come back

272
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:57,880
yeah always come back so I would have to

273
00:11:55,570 --> 00:12:00,670
use some sort of tactic to immobilize

274
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:03,640
them like something really bad oh you

275
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:05,110
can block them on Twitter no I meant

276
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,700
like hurting them physically what is

277
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:10,890
that would that would hurt them

278
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:10,890
perfectly what about their only weakness

279
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,990
come on Twitter James Charles you can't

280
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:20,140

5,000 squats we should press your head

in between those and you'll like it

284
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:27,280
another thing is that he knows how to

285
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:29,020
dress up as a woman which could throw

286
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:31,660
you off because I'm not supposed to hurt

287
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:35,610

00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:56,339
but he wouldn't kill me Jack would never

362
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:58,709
hurt me or maybe those scenarios where

363
00:15:56,339 --> 00:16:00,930
you think Jack would never hurt me but

364
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:02,820
once you're hanging on that Cliff on the

365
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:15,330
pool of lava he looks down at you and

366
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:16,560
say it's my time now I would want to

367
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:22,470
fight you though he'd want to get along

368
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:24,660
with you you know he is nice put them in

369
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:27,029
the middle you guess start to fight but

370
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:28,740
then you just decide that it's not worth

371
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:31,770
it so you guys kiss and make up

372
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:33,720

markiplier this is a tough one

374
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:38,820
he is extremely short with them

375
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:40,980
extremely large head though so it's an

376
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,970
easy target for you there's a big hitbox

377
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:52,740
he's dead already

378
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:54,630
