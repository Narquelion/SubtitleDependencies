care what other people think and other

47
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,679
people's feelings we don't have empathy

48
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:13,330
alright it isn't mumbo Jumbo's fault

49
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:15,850
YouTube is awful this card was May

50
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:19,450
as a better Skype it's time for a

51
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:22,720
battery and that's a fact

52
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:27,220
damn is it me or is something super

53
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:29,410
Savage d rehire Papa Gloria for Pugh

54
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:33,610
news it's not gonna happen

55
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:35,050
stop crying she's dead that's right she

56
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:38,530
had no money to pay for her hospital

57
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:43,500
bills and she passed away last September

58
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:45,850
and you did nothing much I bet you feel

59
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:49,270
yeah here it is again

60
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:51,790
what 24-hour challenge should I do next

61
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:53,920
why don't you ask mr. bass like

62
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:55,480
obviously this is blatantly ripping off

63
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,130
but at the same time there's always a

64
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,690
thin line between these things that I

65
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:00,790
think a lot of people look way too much

66
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:02,620
into and if I play the same game of

67
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:04,960
someone else when the little goddamn

68
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:07,390
game came out that day people still say

69
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:10,600
oh you're a copy I don't want to promote

70
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:12,160
that sort of toxic behavior okay I want

71
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,530
everyone to be free and make whatever

72
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:17,320
video they want but Morris is copying

73
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:20,880
mr. face and let that word echo

74
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:23,470
throughout the month end of YouTube

75
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,810
Thank You Felix for both the videos that

76
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:28,270
you made about the situation meant a lot

77
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:29,739
that you saw what was going on and the

78
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:31,810
advice in your second video was

79
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:33,070
incredibly helpful and appreciated love

80
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:35,500

00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:36,970
ah yeah here we go again I'm surprised

82
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,640
to acknowledge the second video because

83
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:42,430
it was very critical of him I mean props

84
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:44,770
for that can't tell if genuinely nice or

85
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:47,170
spineless you definitely watch Pierce

86
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:49,030
video but apologies very nice but he

87
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:51,250
didn't reference the mom line which I

88
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:53,980
thought was good this generation we live

89
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:55,330
in is disgusting from the beauty

90
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:58,300
community drama this week two people

91
00:03:55,330 --> 00:04:00,790
take okay so Jake Paul addresses that

92
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:03,489
people call out on his anti-bullying

93
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:06,100
video where's the good where's the fun

94
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:09,519
where's the love too many negative souls

95
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:12,070
did you read a Bible or something you

96
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,890
wrote diss tracks on your brother abuse

97
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:17,260

well played hey Chad wouldn't be epic if

104
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:34,420
I went on cold ones I know I don't do

105
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:38,650
podcasts but that could be epic cringe

106
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:42,130
Tuesday material yeah I don't feel so

107
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:44,440
good mr. Starr I feel like this is setup

108
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:46,750
though it has to be set up this is fake

109
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:49,630
when I tell my dad I lost my virginity

110
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:53,350
what he expects I broke my balls what I

111
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:55,720
tell him I broke my a ten out of ten

112
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:58,419
well played guys tech companies when

113
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:00,370
they changed the Gotham hoji to a water

114
00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:03,460
gun well boys we did it

115
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:06,070
violence is no more we cancel violence

116
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:08,770
hashtag violence escapes from everyone

117
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:11,140
we made a profound positive impact today

118
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:15,450
and we took a stance against violence

119
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:18,669
everywhere no one pickets raffle tickets

120
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:21,460
hey I'm working on it I'm trying to work

121
00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:23,740
out the camera stuff I'm still trying to

122
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:26,919
figure it out basically all the merch

123
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:30,040
money will go into trying to figure out

124
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:35,430
the camera stuff that's right meanwhile

125
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:35,430
in universe 69 69 I broke my bra Oh

126
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:42,160
rest in peace

127
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:44,380
Epps in the chat boys I broke from

128
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,450
abouth hey I remember touching your

129
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:48,729
balls thank you ball doctor I'm glad you

130
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:50,740
remember it would make me feel worse if

131
00:05:48,729 --> 00:05:52,750
I went through that traumatic experience

132
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:54,760
and then you don't even remember it it

133
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:57,280
was like the one time I kissed a guy for

134
00:05:54,760 --> 00:06:00,160
the first time he remembers nothing I'm

135
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,770
scarred for life not fair another story

136
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,590
time perhaps Tati may not have monetize

137
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:10,450
her video but she sure is monetizing

138
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:12,910
mine Tati this video was monetized she

139
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:14,710
probably made like 200 grand just from

140
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:17,140
that revenue let's not even get into the

141
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:20,500
beauty product how can someone be so

142
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:23,169
lucrative to promote a product that is

143
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:27,750
supposed to enhance your beauty me

144
00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:27,750
drawing baby pie from memory

145
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:33,999
yes it's beautiful um thank you for

146
00:06:31,689 --> 00:06:35,050
drawing the nose entering my face that's

147
00:06:33,999 --> 00:06:37,930
very beautiful

148
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:40,289
I thank you so much if Jack Paul's point

149
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:42,939
is that you have to be publicly

150
00:06:40,289 --> 00:06:45,309
humiliated to learn then why the Frick

151
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:48,999
are you the same Jake I added the Frick

152
00:06:45,309 --> 00:06:50,979
there for extra savagery get I wonder

153
00:06:48,999 --> 00:06:53,979
because a lot of people's problem with

154
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:55,389
Jake criticizing bullying is like where

155
00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:57,219
you're the wrong person to do that

156
00:06:55,389 --> 00:06:59,830
you've done all this bad thing but just

157
00:06:57,219 --> 00:07:00,999
because you've done some bad things does

158
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:03,580
that mean you're not allowed to

159
00:07:00,999 --> 00:07:05,740
criticize other bad things it seems a

160
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:08,620
little bit stupid as well but at the

161
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:10,409
same time he did it so poorly and and I

162
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:14,319
think trying to pretend like you're

163
00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:16,419
above everyone else at least it seemed

164
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,520
that way in the video I think that's the

165
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:20,319
issue I don't think it's like Jake can't

166
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:23,770
criticize these things like it was

167
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,449
insinuated in the first week my point is

168
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:27,219
I don't have as big of a problem with

169
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:29,020
Jake Pallas I think people think I have

170
00:07:27,219 --> 00:07:31,029
it's just that I don't where he gets

171
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:33,939
these ideas when you're kids gets

172
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:36,639
hepatitis B instead of hepatitis A plus

173
00:07:33,939 --> 00:07:39,849
this is so sad I don't even get the joke

174
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:44,069
watching an eight minute apology video

175
00:07:39,849 --> 00:07:46,930
watching peers review it for 16 minute I

176
00:07:44,069 --> 00:07:49,060
feel like it's a good testimony if I

177
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:50,589
managed to make the most painful video

178
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:54,069
to watch them all time actually

179
00:07:50,589 --> 00:07:57,159
watchable I'll take it papi Gloria after

180
00:07:54,069 --> 00:07:59,770
getting fired this is so sad youtuber

181
00:07:57,159 --> 00:08:02,559
makes bad apology video pues fix it time

182
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:04,300
