talk to everything sweet yeah yeah

184
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,550
all right kind of afraid to actually

185
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,670
actually I remember the headphones that

186
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:13,910
no no run

187
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:17,510
run don't make my mistake don't make my

188
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:19,280
mistake I'm joking I am so happy

189
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:31,190
besides the headphones everything was

190
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:34,400
perfect okay probably the personality

191
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:36,230
the personality guy look pretty but I

192
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:39,700
can't talk to you about anything it's

193
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:42,100
like how is that gonna go rich Brian won

194
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:47,060
he did eh

195
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:48,860
there's hope there result I just have a

196
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:50,510
lot of fun getting to know you I enjoy

197
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:51,800
talking to you as well so you just want

198
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:54,260
to keep getting to know each other a

199
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:58,850
little bit more I mean if you want to

200
00:10:54,260 --> 00:11:00,200
he's pretty submit sure I mean I've seen

201
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:05,990
these sides probably more oh yeah

202
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:10,430
surprise for you but stand up nothing

203
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:16,610
changes Bo he's taller than you why are

204
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:18,500
you rated with 3 he's taller she rated

205
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:20,450
him low because she wasn't taller

206
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:23,620
I mean opposite of what I said well 1/2

207
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:26,210
of what office said what I said yeah

208
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:34,940
look it's way taller breath personality

209
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:37,460
pretty high you know usually like

210
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:41,390
looks-wise no but like personality wise

211
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:42,880
like I raised she's gonna die so that's

212
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:45,680
kind of cool ish you picked the

213
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:48,830
personality over look but at the same

214
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,990
time is she gonna have to tell him what

215
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:59,930
she rated him cuz that's gonna be

216
00:11:50,990 --> 00:12:01,970
interesting usually when I pick people

217
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:03,620
now it's like out of social setting and

218
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:05,090
it's definitely all by looks because I

219
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:06,560
don't get to talk to all of them

220
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:09,110
it's definitely change my perspective a

221
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,000
little bit on like how I write better

222
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:11,810
you know I appreciate her bringing out

223
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,520
the person that has the highest

224
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:15,230
personality because I think that you can

225
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:17,090
grow to become physically attracted to

226
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:19,010
them if you and if your personalities

227
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:20,600
align very well I thought was gonna say

228
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:24,460
grow as a person and not be so kind

229
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,460
shallow but okay I guess that works too

230
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:32,579
sure oh it's all good I mean I was

231
00:12:31,319 --> 00:12:41,670
