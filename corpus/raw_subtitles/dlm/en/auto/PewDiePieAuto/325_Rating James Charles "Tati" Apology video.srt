1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:15,809
apology video time how I'm gonna record

2
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:19,289
this video dude James Charles legendary

3
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:23,369
apology to Tati now with 47 million

4
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:26,970
views god damn up on its way to becoming

5
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:30,750
the most viewed apology video of all

6
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:34,320
time almost beating Logan Paul's so

7
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:35,280
sorry for my severe lapse of judgment 55

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,530
million views

9
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,320
I bet Logan is actually heard about that

10
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,540
dammit my apology video is number one

11
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,579
most people would be like ooh finally

12
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,940
people moved on to another cut I don't

13
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:49,320
know I'm just joking anyway yeah now I

14
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,320
think it's safe to say that people

15
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,270
didn't like this apology video not just

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,940
from losing I what is it now

17
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,890
over three million subscribers but for

18
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:01,350
having three million dislikes on the

19
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:03,359
video and I always say just come to me

20
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:06,530
if you need to make an apology video

21
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,830
just come to me so this doesn't happen

22
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:10,380
alright

23
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:12,479
when will you learn wait will you learn

24
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,220
so therefore we will go through what's

25
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,369
wrong with this apology video what's

26
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:26,580
right about it spoilers not much so

27
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:28,740
without further ado hi now James is

28
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,299
doing the classic I'm just gonna turn on

29
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,579
the camera and talk for eight minutes

30
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:33,960
which I can appreciate in the sense of

31
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:34,560
at least you know he doesn't have a

32
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,200
script

33
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,150
it's just speaking his emotions but at

34
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,090
the same time you have a lot of people

35
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,590
angry James you wanna be clear and

36
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,479
concise with what you're gonna say

37
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:48,450
generally if you want to get a message

38
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:51,119
across any message okay the number one

39
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:53,729
rule of information is the easier the

40
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,130
message is to say the quicker it will

41
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:58,200
spread right and to just turn on the

42
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:01,969
camera and bla bla bla bla bla bla bla

43
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,969
isn't gonna do that okay

44
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:06,910
I'm currently traveling abroad and just

45
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:08,619
woke up but I wanted to sit down and

46
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:11,920
make a video addressing all everything

47
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:14,320
going on right now okay so so far what

48
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,540
15 seconds in he said nothing that we

49
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:19,360
can already tell by just watching this

50
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:21,460
video alright you just woke up hey guys

51
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,410
I just woke up from my hair

52
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:24,880
can you tell even though I apparently

53
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:27,310
sleep with earrings on

54
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:29,950
so that makes no sense I owe everybody

55
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:35,590
an explanation but most importantly I

56
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:41,620
owe to important people an apology to

57
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:44,320
talk to you and James Westbrook I'm

58
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:45,750
sorry for everything that is going on

59
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:52,420
everything that I have put you through

60
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:55,660
over the past few weeks it looks like

61
00:02:52,420 --> 00:03:03,880
he's about to sneeze what is that that's

62
00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:05,860
great I love that god damn this who

63
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,840
speaks slowly again if you want the

64
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:10,269
message across you might want to be a

65
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,070
little quicker so he apologized to Tati

66
00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:13,780
which in a way you know it's big of him

67
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:15,970
to do but at the same time it just

68
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:18,030
reaffirmed was kind of it everything she

69
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:20,170
said you know if you make it a mistake

70
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:22,030
apologizing is the right thing to do

71
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:24,459
without a doubt but if you made a

72
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:26,590
mistake with someone else when people

73
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:28,660
don't really know what happened to just

74
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:30,910
flat-out apologize seems to me like

75
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:33,820
everything they said was right I met

76
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:35,920
Tati and James

77
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:37,870
almost three years ago now when I was

78
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:41,890
first coming into the industry and when

79
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:46,810
I had no friends and nobody to talk to

80
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:51,549
or look up to and Tati very quickly took

81
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:53,290
on a parental role with me because she

82
00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:55,780
knew my parents were across the country

83
00:03:53,290 --> 00:04:01,040
and

84
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:02,540
over the past few not her family I think

85
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,880
another thing worth mentioning here is

86
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:08,570
that this video has more views than

87
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:10,010
taught this video so I understand that

88
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:12,080
he's trying to explain some context

89
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:14,300
behind the situation of how he met Conte

90
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:18,830
what if you don't know who Patti is it's

91
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:21,460
just so bad a lot of money most of my

92
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:26,360
career over the past few years has been

93
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:28,640
about me making mistakes and trying to

94
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,840
learn and grow from them and they

95
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:33,110
haven't always done the best job of that

96
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:35,660
hey James I guess we're not so different

97
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:42,740
you and I can't really be too harsh on

98
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:45,110
him okay always trying well try harder I

99
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,460
was really curious about James past

100
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:48,770
controversies because I don't know

101
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:50,750
anything about him but tachi said

102
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:52,820
something about it boil it all a scandal

103
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:56,030
and everyone was really afraid that he

104
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:57,680
was very toxic so what do you do this is

105
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:59,750
last year I can't believe we're going to

106
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,470
Africa today oh my god what if we get

107
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:07,610
Ebola James were fine we've gotten it as

108
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:10,310
sheep Oatley last year what we could

109
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:12,050
have gone to a shovel what let's keep

110
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:15,590
there's a lot of people watching me and

111
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:21,830
then a lot of people look up to me as a

112
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:25,250
role model and I hate knowing that I

113
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:27,410
disappointed not really them but most

114
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:31,900
importantly to people that have been

115
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:35,169
role models to me doing this

116
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:36,160
um I wish that I could say this is the

117
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:43,690
last time that I would make a mistake

118
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:46,539
that won't be what a train wreck yeah

119
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:48,910
you know if you're gonna apologize maybe

120
00:05:46,539 --> 00:05:51,280
it's not the best to lead with I'm gonna

121
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:53,830
make more mistakes guys like before

122
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,930
anyone's even seen that you've made any

123
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:58,030
effort to improve I'm still gonna make

124
00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:00,220
more mistakes guys this is just adding

125
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:02,169
more fuel to the flame at this point I'd

126
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:04,570
be lying if I said I'm still gonna make

127
00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:09,160
some moves these guys I know that I'm

128
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:10,750
just the point people more and more as I

129
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:18,820
continue to learn and grow every single

130
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:21,370
day I'm gonna go very long way to go I

131
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:23,410
like how it seems like he catches

132
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:24,039
himself smiling there and then it's like

133
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:29,169
oh God

134
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:34,330
need to follow up with a pretty long way

135
00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:35,349
to go here's where you say I'm still

136
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:37,150
gonna make mistakes

137
00:06:35,349 --> 00:06:39,910
after you've acknowledged that you're

138
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:41,320
trying to improve not before Jesus

139
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:43,300
Christ and be the best version of me

140
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:45,690
that I possibly can be I'm know I'm not

141
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:52,780
perfect I'm still gonna make mistakes

142
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:55,030
so stupid I'm sorry in regards to the

143
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:57,580
coachella situation with the brand deal

144
00:06:55,030 --> 00:07:01,860
on the security guard I've already told

145
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:04,060
my truth about this twice and instead of

146
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:06,310
talking about it for a third time and

147
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:09,389
explaining it and going into detail and

148
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:13,120
pulling up receipts it doesn't matter

149
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:15,909
it does matter James I've tried my best

150
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,370
to look into this drama I have no idea

151
00:07:15,909 --> 00:07:19,960
what happened okay people don't know

152
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:22,389
what happened so you might want to

153
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:24,070
address it okay just because you've said

154
00:07:22,389 --> 00:07:26,080
it twice doesn't mean that everyone's

155
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:28,060
already heard it okay clearly you have a

156
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,949
lot of new eyes on you here you want to

157
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:31,870
treat this video as if someone

158
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:34,330
completely new to you who's only heard

159
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:36,099
about you from this scandal and give the

160
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:37,870
context from there to say that you've

161
00:07:36,099 --> 00:07:38,349
already explained it doesn't mean

162
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,129
anything

163
00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:41,259
I

164
00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:43,149
understand that no matter what I say and

165
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:45,099
then he follows it up with probably the

166
00:07:43,149 --> 00:07:46,989
dumbest line you could say one of the

167
00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:50,800
dumbest line I've heard in an apology

168
00:07:46,989 --> 00:07:54,639
video I understand that no matter what I

169
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,499
say or do they're always gonna be people

170
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,709
that don't believe me and will think

171
00:07:56,499 --> 00:08:02,080
that I am lying yes yes you're not wrong

172
00:07:59,709 --> 00:08:04,539
but why God sir would you say that

173
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,519
that's like insulting these people that

174
00:08:04,539 --> 00:08:11,110
you're trying to persuade in your

175
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:12,969
apology like you have all these new eyes

176
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:15,639
on you that are gonna look at you

177
00:08:12,969 --> 00:08:16,959
extremely critically and to say doesn't

178
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:21,879
matter what I say you're not gonna

179
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:23,740
believe me anyway like yes technically

180
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:25,749
you're not wrong people are very riled

181
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:27,639
up right now and in a way it probably

182
00:08:25,749 --> 00:08:29,740
doesn't matter that much what he says

183
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:31,689
but at the same time to say that it's

184
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,370
such a dumb idea there's plenty of

185
00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:36,550
things that yes technically you're right

186
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:39,669
but to say that in this context is a bad

187
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:43,870
idea there's a bad idea James that's

188
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:45,970
okay at this point the truth really does

189
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:48,040
not matter even worse following about

190
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:51,189
the truth doesn't matter you're all just

191
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:52,720
so wrong about me then tell us tell us

192
00:08:51,189 --> 00:08:54,459
people don't know they haven't heard you

193
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,939
talk about these things he talks about

194
00:08:54,459 --> 00:08:59,139
how the boys situation where he has been

195
00:08:57,939 --> 00:09:00,850
hitting on a bunch of straight people

196
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:02,860
he's been very public about this and

197
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:04,750
he's saying I wish I wasn't public about

198
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:06,790
it instead of saying I wish I didn't do

199
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:10,689
that he just says I wish I didn't tell

200
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:12,339
people I did that great idea boys have

201
00:09:10,689 --> 00:09:13,990
been a topic that I've talked a lot

202
00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:18,340
about

203
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:21,970
my social media journey and it's a topic

204
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:24,610
I wish I hadn't people think what you

205
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:26,140
did was wrong to say that you just wish

206
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:28,780
you didn't tell people about it instead

207
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:30,730
of I acknowledging that what you did was

208
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:32,230
wrong is really strange but

209
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:34,360
coincidentally enough talk to you really

210
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:36,520
once one of the people to set me down

211
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:42,040
and tell me how it looked from the

212
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:44,050
outside and let me know hey talking to

213
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:53,950
these boys might get you in trouble one

214
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:55,900
day and she was right in regards to so

215
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:58,240
he just brushed through the whole boy

216
00:09:55,900 --> 00:10:17,670
situation without any acknowledgment of

217
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:20,890
that being wrong good job why why why

218
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:22,690
why are you dressing your mom is this

219
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:23,800
how he talks to his mom they don't text

220
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:25,330
each other they don't call each other

221
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:29,080
they just talk through his YouTube

222
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:33,180
channel no matter what if anybody is

223
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:33,180
saying or commenting or talking about

224
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:46,030
person anyway sorry I I know this is not

225
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,890
a laughing moment but it seems like he

226
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:49,870
wanted to run round this up on an

227
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:52,000
emotional part and bringing up your

228
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:54,670
parents when you've disappointed it's

229
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,440
obviously gonna hit anyone really hard

230
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:58,300
that's just how I interpreted this I

231
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,610
can't understand why else he would just

232
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:03,280
bring up his parents maybe to get some

233
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:06,610
sympathy I don't know it's really weird

234
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:08,590
an apology video should be to the people

235
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:11,280
you're apologizing here and then you're

236
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:11,280
an amazing mother

237
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:15,519
and I don't know what i'ma do without

238
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:18,570
you

239
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:20,620
well she clearly didn't do a good job

240
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:26,079
for me and the lessons that you have

241
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:29,730
taught me and and everything that you

242
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:32,470
continue to do for me and my brother I

243
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:35,800
need you to know that I need you to know

244
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:39,070
that all right okay chill out James and

245
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:43,360
the same thing goes for talk to you as

246
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:44,889
well who is an amazing person what goes

247
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,829
to Tandy I already forgot what he said

248
00:11:44,889 --> 00:11:50,290
he speaks so goddamn slowly my god

249
00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:52,449
don't waste people's time I feel I

250
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:55,360
watched it all at seven minutes it feels

251
00:11:52,449 --> 00:11:58,240
like an hour and truly does want the

252
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,680
best for everybody around her I wonder

253
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,380
how many people actually watch the whole

254
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:07,990
thing I doubt many people did it's so

255
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:14,699
boring my god I'm so disappointed to

256
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:14,699
myself that I hurt her

257
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:23,899
end the video James some a lot of times

258
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:28,639
when I kind of address things in the

259
00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:31,850
past oh my god I keep it on today out of

260
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,740
impulse and I've gone off that what the

261
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:36,350
hell is this how is this not an impulse

262
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:38,779
a lot of other times I got in drama I

263
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:41,839
reacted an impulse you uploaded this the

264
00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:44,060
day after this video did nothing but add

265
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:46,639
more fuel to the flame you want to take

266
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:48,470
at least one day off for people to say

267
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,480
what they need to say about you so then

268
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:53,269
you can come in and also for you

269
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,970
yourself to kind of take in what's going

270
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:56,389
on and not just immediately going oh I'm

271
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:57,829
sorry

272
00:12:56,389 --> 00:12:59,449
it doesn't matter what I say you're not

273
00:12:57,829 --> 00:13:08,630
gonna believe me anyway and tried to

274
00:12:59,449 --> 00:13:10,190
pull a receipt it's probably too dumb to

275
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:12,170
be able to do that anyway I know that's

276
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:14,180
kind of mean to say but Patty's clearly

277
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:16,220
way smarter than James she's got more

278
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:18,079
experience there's no way even if you

279
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:19,970
had the fact that he would be able to

280
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:22,250
pull that off there's almost he's just

281
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:23,630
admitting defeat at this point the video

282
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:26,600
goes on I can't I can't literally

283
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:29,389
actually not finish it here's the thing

284
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:31,699
this video did nothing now it's been a

285
00:13:29,389 --> 00:13:33,709
couple days since it's been uploaded and

286
00:13:31,699 --> 00:13:35,389
what's gonna be the follow-up he's

287
00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:36,889
already said he's not gonna address

288
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:38,720
anything because people aren't gonna

289
00:13:36,889 --> 00:13:40,970
believe him anyway so what is he gonna

290
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,220
do now people just added more and more

291
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:45,709
rumors and speculations because you

292
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:47,720
didn't address any of it and people are

293
00:13:45,709 --> 00:13:50,149
very confused of what actually happened

294
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:52,279
so he can't come back and explain the

295
00:13:50,149 --> 00:13:54,529
situation how is he gonna come back from

296
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:57,079
this I don't know and I think that's why

297
00:13:54,529 --> 00:14:00,560
this is such a terrible apology video

298
00:13:57,079 --> 00:14:03,079
and also literally all he had to do in

299
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,199
my opinion this if I was James Charles

300
00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:08,240
the way I would have done it is to say

301
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:10,670
explain the context of your personality

302
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,980
change of you becoming this ugly figure

303
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:15,410
you can explain I'm very young I became

304
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:17,420
extremely so sex no not extremely that

305
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:20,089
would be gloating but I became very

306
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:23,329
successful very quickly and that has had

307
00:14:20,089 --> 00:14:26,180
a very negative impact on my personality

308
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:29,569
and now that I've heard people around me

309
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:32,570
I realized that and then so hurt that it

310
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:35,060
took me this long to understand this

311
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:36,770
and then I'm gonna take some time off to

312
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:38,090
to focus on rebuilding these

313
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:41,090
relationship and saving these

314
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:43,040
relationships and also taking time to

315
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:44,810
focus on improving myself because I know

316
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,910
that's what I need to do now more than

317
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:48,410
anything I'm sorry to everyone that I

318
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:50,840
hurt and I'm sorry to everyone that I

319
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:53,240
disappointed at least then you said

320
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:54,890
these things you've acknowledged that

321
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,540
what you did was wrong and that you're

322
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:58,880
gonna improve and then when you come

323
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:00,530
back you have something to come back to

324
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,360
I don't know how James is gonna come

325
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:05,210
back from this I think this actually

326
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:07,970
could be the end I don't know he's still

327
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:09,470
so young however and people don't tend

328
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:12,950
to care about these things for too long

329
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:15,350
so I think he'll be fine but I think it

330
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:18,380
again another testimony of how you

331
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:21,110
express yourself in a controversy will

332
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:22,640
massively affect your career they could

333
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:24,470
make it worse or they could make it

334
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:27,350
better this one definitely made it worse

335
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:29,000
which is why you should come to me now

336
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:30,530
I'm joking about like oh you should come

337
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,780
to me about apology videos and that

338
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:35,120
might seem like I'm super calculative

339
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:37,310
about my apology videos I think luckily

340
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,170
I've been able to speak for in an honest

341
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:41,090
way and I think that also matters more

342
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:43,220
than anything but when you have so many

343
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:45,350
emotions going when you're in the middle

344
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:47,990
of a controversy like this it's easy to

345
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:50,420
get sidetracked and and confused about

346
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:52,550
what you're doing what do you think

347
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:54,620
