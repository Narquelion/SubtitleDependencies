00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,360
explain this so it doesn't get taken out

377
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:28,720
of context for media to just go like

378
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,279
he doesn't care about his fans i love

379
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,120
meeting

380
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,399
you guys that's the thing like i love

381
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,519
doing these meetups

382
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,000
where it's a set place to hang out and

383
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,160
just talk

384
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,600
and and meet up and get a chance to meet

385
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,959
you guys i think that's always something

386
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,880
i really love doing but

387
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:45,279
i think my life has just become to a

388
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,560
point where whenever i go outside i have

389
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:49,680
to just be ready

390
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,759
whatever i'm doing uh to just stop

391
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,519
and take a photo and i don't mind just

392
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,279
to stop and chat with you guys but the

393
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:58,800
whole photo process to me

394
00:16:55,279 --> 00:17:00,880
i don't i don't like it you do like

395
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,079
10 000 of them and after a while you

396
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,319
just feel like you're an

397
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,439
animal at a zoo that's like a prop for

398
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,319
someone

399
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,959
and i don't i don't like it i'm tired of

400
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,280
it

401
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,959
i don't want to do it anymore so don't

402
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,760
misunderstand me like if you meet me i

403
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,959
would love to

404
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:20,079
meet you like chat quick whatever but

405
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,199
i don't want to take a photo i'm done

406
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,120
i know that's hard for people to

407
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,919
understand and i don't expect everyone

408
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,600
to understand

409
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,039
this is something i decided so i can

410
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,880
feel more comfortable going out in

411
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,799
public because i'm kinda

412
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,480
i kind of feel weird about always being

413
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,880
ready to take a photo with someone

414
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,760
and there's a lot of other layers to it

415
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,760
as well with that

416
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,039
i don't always want people to know where

417
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,640
i am

418
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:42,160
you know if everyone just took their

419
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,240
photo and

420
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,320
didn't share it fine but the problem is

421
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,760
people share it online and then people

422
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,200
other people online see it and they're

423
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,160
like oh there he's there what is he

424
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,480
doing there and

425
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,160
yeah yeah i feel like i always have to

426
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,320
it's so uncomfortable and

427
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,640
like you meet a fan that's outside your

428
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,320
house and you don't really want to say

429
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,919
hey can we not do a photo because i

430
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,520
actually live here

431
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,960
because you don't want them to know that

432
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:09,039
you actually live there

433
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:10,880
it's so hard to explain these things uh

434
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:13,280
there's a lot of nuances to it and in

435
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,799
general i think the main thing is i just

436
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,200
don't i just don't like it

437
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,799
and i think my audience respect me

438
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,039
enough to understand that uh

439
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,559
i'm happy to do a selfie if it's an at a

440
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,400
meeting meeting

441
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,320
and greet place or whatever because it's

442
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,520
a different context but when i'm out in

443
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,160
public

444
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,840
it's just uh it's just gotten to a point

445
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,480
where it feels dehumanizing and i don't

446
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,720
enjoy

447
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,600
being in public anymore because of it so

448
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,440
i decided

449
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,039
uh for my own sake i'm not doing it

450
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,919
anymore i might change my mind in the

451
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,679
future but

452
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:45,280
i already feel better with this decision

453
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,280
so thank you for understanding

454
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,720
