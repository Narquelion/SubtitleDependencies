there's a limit to everything

33
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:39,119
oh my god alright let's watch this my

34
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,860
life's not to revolve around kpop and I

35
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,049
want my entire lip to look like Jimmy

36
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,329
and the lead singer would be Jessica's

37
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:47,460
for me he's perfection I just kind of

38
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:49,619
wanna I mean he's not wrong if you gotta

39
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:51,840
pick anyone to look like Jim and that's

40
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:55,470
not a bad pic at least maybe fewer

41
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:58,740
korean at least I don't

42
00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:00,840
oh god I don't want to be mean but it's

43
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,030
gonna be hard about my entire look to

44
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,630
look like Jimmy he's gonna say my my

45
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:09,810
k-pop idol Oh No

46
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:12,510
jimin from BTS is his k-pop idol he's

47
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,970
like a 12 year old teenage girl trapped

48
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,830
in an

49
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:18,570
old man's body that's what this is

50
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:18,570
because that's what they would do right

51
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:24,790
BTS debuted in 2013 now is actually I'm

52
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:26,980
getting Bart Baker vibes from this and

53
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:29,740
what this is alt Universe bait marker

54
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,210
the Korean version Bart Baker this is

55
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,950
his current hostile environment let's

56
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:35,050
plan for the replicator you know you can

57
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:36,850
have your own hairstyle right gym and

58
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:39,580
change hairstyle I have to change it too

59
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:41,320
because I don't know I want to be here

60
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:44,770
but I was ever questioned he liked to

61
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:47,380
wear this okay pop stars of us what he

62
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:49,680
wants to be him but he also have a crush

63
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:52,360
on him what is that how does that work

64
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,280
it's getting creepier as we go these are

65
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,990
some of my shoes that these ones they're

66
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,910
very very very striking especially with

67
00:02:55,990 --> 00:03:00,340
the spikes though the k-pop stars wear

68
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:02,320
this particular brand as well now these

69
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:06,850
ones were expensive one where he has oh

70
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:09,670
my god 5700 790 this one was my most

71
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:11,620
expensive clothing item over 7000 this

72
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:13,840
how do they always afford this this is

73
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:16,360
why some people needs to be poor okay no

74
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,970
offense poor Chi Minh actually wore this

75
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,140
in the fake love video so I'm super

76
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:21,430
obsessed to wear it all the time it's so

77
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:24,700
yeah this is very special to me because

78
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:26,410
obviously Jimin wore the same one so I'm

79
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:28,510
gonna go on a limb here and say this man

80
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:30,790
is obsessed with Jimin if any one of you

81
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:32,980
[ __ ] ever do this on me I will shoot

82
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:35,080
you I will shoot you in the face I don't

83
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,790
have guns but I'll figure it it out in

84
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,830
the kpop stars have so much pressure on

85
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:40,570
them before they even become famous they

86
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:41,739
have to train for four years they lived

87
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:43,600
together we have to Train eight hours a

88
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:45,190
day it's all manufactured the way they

89
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,410
look the way they perform they all look

90
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:49,209
incredibly perfect yeah that's the whole

91
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:51,940
thing right it's all manufactured they

92
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:54,790
all do surgery in Korea it's all just

93
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:56,860
companies producing these stars like out

94
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:59,049
of a treadmill and you want to

95
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:00,400
appropriate that when I actually watch

96
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:00,970
their videos I cry just because they're

97
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,340
so beautiful

98
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:05,680
that's definitely normal you guys have a

99
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:07,810
crime watching my videos that's okay

100
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,850
though one is actually an original photo

101
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:12,459
I'm trying to think how long ago this

102
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:14,530
was maybe like see he looks fine

103
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:16,419
you look fine you don't have to look

104
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:18,489
like Jermaine you don't have to look

105
00:04:16,419 --> 00:04:20,799
like Jermaine you look better there I'll

106
00:04:18,489 --> 00:04:22,720
say it you look way better there gives

107
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,940
the thing with plastic surgery it's like

108
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,710
yeah I understand you have some part of

109
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:29,710
you that you maybe want to change but

110
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:31,480
you look like plastic surgery it's not

111
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:34,300
like a natural look you look like

112
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:36,280
surgery happen to your face and I don't

113
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:38,200
understand how that is helping anyone

114
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,750
I had very bad acne when I was at school

115
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:42,880
and I had a very last time I checked you

116
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:45,520
don't need surgery for acne where's all

117
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,740
the acne then me my nose is very big

118
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,510
it's horrible I can't it's very hard to

119
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:51,550
look at it I don't even recognize the

120
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:55,270
person they come I just don't even seem

121
00:04:51,550 --> 00:05:00,120
to relate to this person it's weird

122
00:04:55,270 --> 00:05:00,120
I had all of the fatty tissue removed

123
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:05,700
I was gonna be in a British girl cousin

124
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:08,130
but I would like to look as close as

125
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:11,520
possible to Koreans like Korean pop

126
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:15,980
stars and Jimin he wants to look as

127
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,980
closely as possible to Korea

128
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:24,420
he's like my version of like in Japan I

129
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,910
don't know this could be me guys he

130
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:28,500
undergoes a surgery and then he's

131
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:31,320
supposed to meet up with his friends and

132
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:34,650
they judge it afterwards and this is

133
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:36,180
where it gets real cringe so what do you

134
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:38,040
guys think of the new look then it's

135
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,350
obviously very different like what do

136
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,940
you think the eyes are it is taking me a

137
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:44,490
little bit of time to adjust to actually

138
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:45,780
because yes do you know it still made

139
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:48,060
you feel like it's still me or do I look

140
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:49,710
more like Jimin I don't ever want to

141
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,230
picture you like this I know starting to

142
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:55,110
be on it oh my god you're upset a little

143
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:56,670
bit because you're upset oh yeah I like

144
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:58,890
you just don't want you to get to a

145
00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:00,660
point where you can't undo anything I

146
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:02,910
mean well I think we crossed that

147
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:09,420
threshold heaven we looking at how we

148
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:19,800
used to like no I'm not gonna get

149
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:20,430
addicted I don't think I've done that

150
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,960
much you know

151
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:26,160
what how do you think no he's is he you

152
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,020
know I don't think it's an addiction I

153
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,800
just think it's a I have a strong

154
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:35,550
interest in pursuing my my gold they

155
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:41,760
don't have anyone doing this early it's

156
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:44,430
a very common thing in their career you

157
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,990
know really oh yeah they do I heard

158
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:48,030
about this they do the puffs underneath

159
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:49,410
the eyes actually that's very popular I

160
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:52,050
think I think that's the surgery

161
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:53,670
you did why do I know that yeah it's a

162
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:56,160
trend because it's it's the thing in

163
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:58,350
Korea it is a point like it's weird for

164
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,150
finally think of a good equivalent that

165
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:02,330
doesn't sound too racist so I'm just not

166
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:05,250
gonna say it but it is weird

167
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:07,850
that's why that's not my goal I want to

168
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,850
look Korean

169
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:16,770
Jimmy Jimmy I wanted to get a lateral

170
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:19,050
canthoplasty with it's cutting me

171
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:20,910
incisions here and kind of cutting the

172
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:22,800
skin out and then it's already planning

173
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:25,140
to make the eyes more of an almond shape

174
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,030
so I don't want to look like her he

175
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:29,040
wants to make the eyes more of an almond

176
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:32,430
shape you basically want like the

177
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,880
typical Korean eyes imagine leafy coming

178
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:35,130
back

179
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,320
he's got chin implants it looks exactly

180
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:39,870
like the Chad meme he's got the haircut

181
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:41,970
he's got the big nose he's got the

182
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:42,450
muscles that would be amazing I'm not

183
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:44,310
addicted

184
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:47,850
I just want to pursue perfection so now

185
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:50,640
a year later Ollie has not 100% reached

186
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:54,920
his goal yet he's not addicted okay stop

187
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:54,920
it he's doing a couple more surgeries

188
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,480
Gangnam style I know that reference it's

189
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:02,160
like that song where he already looks so

190
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,590
different geez form into a kpop star

191
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,330
it's gonna be very painful not actually

192
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:09,090
changing my race cultural appreciation

193
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:11,730
but you are changing to look exactly

194
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:14,070
like a Korean person and that's what you

195
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:15,630
said in the last video I'm not changing

196
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:17,820
my race I'm just trying to look exactly

197
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:20,520
like another race not cultural

198
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:22,830
appropriation control appreciation I

199
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:25,260
like it

200
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:26,910
I'm not gonna see my new face they're

201
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:28,410
gonna see these are new friends these

202
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:29,670
are different friends if you're one of

203
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:31,110
those that goes through a cycle of new

204
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:32,910
friends every year or what's happening

205
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:35,310
or he has more than two friends maybe

206
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:38,970
that's it I can't really today oh god I

207
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:41,400
just be amazing and their body and I

208
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:42,900
feel for them in a way so now that I'm

209
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,640
done Korea I'm really trying to find

210
00:08:42,900 --> 00:09:01,040
Djimon I'm going to all of his favorite

211
00:08:44,640 --> 00:09:04,260
hangouts favorite places I love you army

212
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:06,090
army and wonder what the BTS stands

213
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:08,550
think about this guy is there the most

214
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:11,610
insane people on the planet it's a very

215
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:15,290
not everyone not everyone somewhere the

216
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:15,290
mine I think that's a pretty fair

217
00:09:15,339 --> 00:09:20,329
amen and they would have grow very harsh

218
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,610
on him so I was able to release the kpop

219
00:09:20,329 --> 00:09:25,519
music video which I never dreamed would

220
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:27,680
happen before on my dream and hopefully

221
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,240
meeting Jim in the most important reason

222
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,579
that I'm in Korea is obviously for my

223
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:34,130
beautiful transformation which I'm about

224
00:09:31,579 --> 00:09:36,709
to undergo he's doing another surgery

225
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:38,389
guys the first five hundred didn't do

226
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:39,199
the trick but he's not addicted did they

227
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:41,750
have to him in flavor

228
00:09:39,199 --> 00:09:53,300
my flavor it's Italian though isn't it

229
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:57,139
look at that and also reducing my

230
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:58,850
cheekbone I'm having a bone shades down

231
00:09:57,139 --> 00:10:00,949
too late West so he's explained to his

232
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:03,139
friend what the surgery procedure is and

233
00:10:00,949 --> 00:10:05,990
I really love this big way it's coming

234
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:08,990
all that in symmetrical I know it's

235
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:11,269
gonna be painful baby I know but it's an

236
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:17,420
amazing Hospital amazing medical team

237
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:20,089
and it's worth it you know if a person

238
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:22,639
that clearly has done a lot of surgery

239
00:10:20,089 --> 00:10:25,160
already looks at you when you tell them

240
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:26,870
about your surgery that way and maybe

241
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:29,089
that should be an indicator that maybe

242
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:30,889
you're doing a couple too many of the

243
00:10:29,089 --> 00:10:38,000
surgeries that's just my opinion

244
00:10:30,889 --> 00:10:40,339
Korean people love me every Memorial

245
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:46,639

00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:49,759

he's always forgetting his bags that's

294
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:16,080
always a funny quality of someone my

295
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,580
favorite stand-up comedians always

296
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:20,640

00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:24,480
k-pop in joke that I don't know about

299
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:26,010
I'm sorry oh I'm sorry to keep up stands

300
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,710
watching this video we're actually at

301
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:28,960
the exact

302
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:31,510
same restaurant that semen and BTS

303
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,140
frequently came to enjoy meals what they

304
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:35,860
eat

305
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:38,710
BTS eat what oh my god

306
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:52,030
is that the holy sanctuary of BTS they

307
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:56,380
probably just came there n8y filming in

308
00:13:52,030 --> 00:14:02,260
the background this is where Jim in

309
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:04,090
shock he's sitting on the scene to say

310
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:17,230
it yeah his butt has touched when he

311
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:20,500
eats but she's talking like this is the

312
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:24,880
church and she's a priest and an Jimin

313
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:31,360
is gone that's how this sounds like this

314
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:36,180
is my dream so I I shake your hand and I

315
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,180
touch do you mean for you it's oh my god

316
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:44,560
the Church of BTS it would surprise me

317
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:46,120
ok methey Oh some dreams just maybe you

318
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,830
shouldn't pursue actually I don't I

319
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,460
don't want to just oh my god that food

320
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:53,080
looks amazing oh my god

321
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:54,970
okay to wrap this up the reason I find

322
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:57,310
out about this cuz he recently went on

323
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:58,600
dr. Phil it's pretty funny I'm not gonna

324
00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:00,250
lie there's some funny clips in there

325
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,410
but it's more or less what we just saw

326
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:04,630
only it seems like a decent guy as a

327
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:06,340
person he doesn't seem I've seen way

328
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:09,220
worse people in dr. Phil put it that way

329
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:10,720
but you know he says in his videos from

330
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:12,370
what I gather he's doing this to be

331
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,680
happy right so there's nothing wrong

332
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:16,540
with then I'm doing what makes me happy

333
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:19,600
I'm following my dreams and then he has

334
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:21,340
a song that is I am perfection that's

335
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,960
his song that's the lyrics of a song I

336
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:25,510
think let me show take a look at me

337
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:27,850
flawless is me I'm more than just pretty

338
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:30,370
great great lyrics and then he goes on

339
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:32,230
dr. Phil and he says you know dr. Phil

340
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:34,000
is like you feel like you need to be

341
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:35,890
someone else and he he confirms it say I

342
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,960
never feel good enough he isn't happy

343
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:39,940
with himself and that's the problem with

344
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,620
this you're never gonna be happy trying

345
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:43,120
to pursue someone that you're not I

346
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:45,220
think it's totally fine if you want to

347
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,590
learn or take from other people some

348
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:50,320
bits that you'd like but just blatantly

349
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:53,050
being what is that stupid expression I

350
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,700
hate expressions but it is I be yourself

351
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:56,350
because no one in the world can be

352
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,810
better at it than you or something like

353
00:15:56,350 --> 00:16:01,180
that I know it yeah it's stupid and

354
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:02,830
cheesy I like this comment as well to be

355
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:04,090
honest he doesn't even look Korean in

356
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:05,830
the slightest he looks like a

357
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:06,820
middle-aged English woman who had

358
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:09,070
plastic surgery

359
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:11,080
he doesn't even pronounce Jimin red

360
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:12,970
cringe he doesn't even know how to

361
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:14,350
pronounce Jimin it seemed to me watching

362
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:16,150
that interview that hey at least he

363
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:18,100
knows he has a problem but he still

364
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:20,020
feels good doing the surgery so that's

365
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,400
his way to cope I feel like if he didn't

366
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,260
he wasn't addicted to this it would have

367
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:25,810
been addicted to something else and I

368
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:28,210
feel for him I'm not gonna lie I feel

369
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:30,190
bad that he's gone to undergone all of

370
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:32,590
this because I doubt he's actually

371
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:34,300
happier that way than if he was before

372
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:36,100
maybe he likes to tell himself that he

373
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:38,290
