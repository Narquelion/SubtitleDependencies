1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,899
before this video begins I have an

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,790
important announcement you want to hear

3
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:07,830
about this there's a new app called

4
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:10,889
nemesis where if you download it your

5
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:13,980
life will become a social media game as

6
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:17,010
soon as you register every single minute

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,650
of your life will be quantified Internet

8
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:22,050
occurrence and this is collected from

9
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:24,269
since you register not just how much you

10
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,070
use your phone or you spend in the app

11
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:28,380
so the more names you have the more

12
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,660
powerful and influence you get now just

13
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:33,210
imagine for a second if everyone

14
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,280
downloaded is that it's a pretty insane

15
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:38,250
concept I don't think I heard about any

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,410
idea anywhere like this excepting sci-fi

17
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,210
scenarios nemesis users could

18
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:44,730
potentially buy real things in the

19
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:47,910
future using their names like your next

20
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:49,800
Tesla or your next represent coms slash

21
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:52,020
PewDiePie merch collection there are

22
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,809
social roles within the app such as the

23
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:57,149
user and icon you get your names you own

24
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:59,579
them and then you save them and everyone

25
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:01,500
sees how many names you have you can be

26
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:03,449
a regular users or you can actually try

27
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,869
and grow your influence and reach the

28
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:08,760
unreachable icon status just imagine if

29
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:10,470
everyone was using this I think it's a

30
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,659
pretty insane idea and I'm really

31
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:15,900

00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:29,420
I'm innocent now let's get into the news

55
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:31,520
our first story comes from Sid who has

56
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:33,739
now responded to dead G his brother

57
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:37,760
calling him out in not just one video

58
00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:40,370
but two videos and ksi has now finally

59
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,980
responded so you thought going on low

60
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:45,739
composed podcasts to talk about me was

61
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:47,269
the best way to branch out for my bro we

62
00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:50,000
went on there to talk about something

63
00:02:47,269 --> 00:02:52,430
else than fine but you did it it was all

64
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,400
pretty much about me the best way H to

65
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:58,760
branch out from me is to not talk about

66
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:01,370
me at all and then on top of that make

67
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:04,310
good quality content that your fans

68
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:06,820
would enjoy does he have a god complex

69
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:09,980
is it that's what I mean like his ego is

70
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:12,049
insane he's like year is distracted

71
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:15,110
cordetta he compared himself to Aries

72
00:03:12,049 --> 00:03:18,049
brah maybe Devi has some points that are

73
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:20,209
fair maybe case I wasn't great brother

74
00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:21,739
or whatever but I think case I did a

75
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:23,420
really good job explaining his side of

76
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:26,870
the situation you can talk to me

77
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:29,420
especially if you having dark thoughts

78
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:31,880
or just feeling low I'm always here for

79
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:35,209
you whether we're on good times or bad

80
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:37,730
terms whenever you message me I always

81
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:40,730
replied edge I want you to succeed in

82
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:44,930
everything you do but Deji man you have

83
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:47,000
to communicate with me how how else am I

84
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,370
going to know how you're feeling and I

85
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,400
got

86
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:52,830
say like hatreds video has mid-roll

87
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,080
zoning he comes with his video out of

88
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:57,840
nowhere with the video that has mid

89
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:00,360
rolls on it 42 minutes right after the

90
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:06,000
whole tattoo situation became a huge

91
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:07,680
viral thing and it's kind of hard to

92
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,440
side with someone that puts that

93
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,769
perspective on it especially when case I

94
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:16,169
made it a lot of good points I'm sorry

95
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:18,180
case I also said that in his video he's

96
00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:20,220
gonna donate all the ad revenue to

97
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,620
suicide prevention charities and in

98
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:25,169
light of day G being in the dark place

99
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:28,560
but then I don't know where Logan Paul

100
00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:31,889
decided to animate laugh and claim the

101
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,990
video haha fu [ __ ] if you don't see ads

102
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:35,430
it's because it's being claimed by Logan

103
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:37,289
Paul's Network Logan

104
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:39,720
what the Frick are you doing do you want

105
00:04:37,289 --> 00:04:41,850
people to hate you what history's money

106
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:45,930
go into suicide prevention charities

107
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:48,000
Logan Paul haha now it's clear let Logan

108
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:49,830
Paul didn't know this and he said I

109
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,720
jumped the gun on that one I'll make

110
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:54,210
sure the automatic claim is removed case

111
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:57,330
I've still a PP this whole situations is

112
00:04:54,210 --> 00:05:00,300
dumb it's dummy dumb dummy dumb dumb now

113
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:03,210
let's go into probably the biggest noise

114
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:06,470
I have ever heard Jesus and it's about

115
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:09,090
the steven crowder versus carlos masa

116
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:10,770
situation but this head here and the

117
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:12,840
other head here they here they are it

118
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:15,990
all started with Fox News reporter

119
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:17,940
Carlos masa who wrote in his Twitter so

120
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:19,949
I have pretty thick skin when it comes

121
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:21,870
to online harassment but something has

122
00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:24,690
been really bothering me he pointed out

123
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:27,570
how whenever steven crowder debunks his

124
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:29,820
videos he also ridicules his sexual

125
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:32,400
orientation and ethnicity before we get

126
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:36,510
to the video with our favorite favorite

127
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:38,220
and lispy right it's ridiculous it's

128
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:40,260
bonkers you're being given a free pass

129
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,820
as a crappy writer because you're gay

130
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:45,349
that's Federline on his a little queer

131
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:48,300
graph there now the graph is queerness

132
00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:49,800
violence Phil okay so the little queer

133
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,169
could eat his chips all nonchalantly

134
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:57,210
it's code for Ray mr. queer eating chess

135
00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:59,700
on the box channel Thanks this is what

136
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:01,060
mr. gay Vox wants to do mister let's be

137
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,440
queer from Bach now Steven

138
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:05,080
for those who you don't know is a

139
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,900
right-wing youtuber and apparently

140
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,940
according to himself he's the biggest

141
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,419
conservative channel on YouTube wait is

142
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:13,870
that true

143
00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:17,110
how many does ben shapiro have 1.7 bruh

144
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:20,139
massa also pointed out how he got doxxed

145
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:22,090
and he got a bunch of text messages

146
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:23,800
saying debates even Crowder

147
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:26,680
now blurred the numbers but I like how

148
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:29,610
Massa complains about being darks and

149
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:32,410
then he talks is all these people

150
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:34,540
regardless he also points out how

151
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:37,479
YouTube's policies against harassment

152
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:40,479
and bullying are not aligned with the

153
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:42,220
comments that Steven has said about him

154
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:45,940
that being said I'm not mad at at

155
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:47,530
Crowder well that's a lie are you sure

156
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:49,510
about that but he does raise a good

157
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:51,970
point I mean I haven't even seen this

158
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:54,340
content that is deliberately posted in

159
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:56,350
order to humiliate someone content that

160
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:58,720
makes hurtful and negative personal

161
00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:01,630
comments videos about that person that's

162
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:04,630
so vague but it does apply doesn't it

163
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:07,000
yeah he does have a point Carlos also

164
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:09,460
pointed out how steven crowder sells a

165
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,430
shirt that says socialism is for FIGS

166
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:14,950
although it's one of those edgy jokes

167
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:17,890
that it can be interpreting their way

168
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:19,900
and he sees it as socialism is for facts

169
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:22,570
now this shirt will be important later

170
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:24,820
okay so let's just remember this shirt

171
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:27,640
for now I have to say I think it is good

172
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:30,550
that Massa speaks out there is a problem

173
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:32,740
with people there is a big issue online

174
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:34,419
where people with audiences criticize

175
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:37,450
each other which they should be able to

176
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:39,639
do but then the audience joins in and

177
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:42,580
makes the whole place toxic with

178
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:44,800
harassment daxing etc of these

179
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:47,350
individuals this is obviously not OK and

180
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,900
if anyone ever does it for me then you

181
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:51,970
can eat the fat Lord okay I want nothing

182
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:54,280
to do with you obviously most people

183
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:56,200
don't want this Crowder has spoken out

184
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:58,930
against this as well but it is a larger

185
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:01,570
issue that none of the less deserves to

186
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:04,090
be brought up so I think it's good he

187
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:07,150
spoke out however the timing of all this

188
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:09,310
is pretty interesting obviously this was

189
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:11,020
posted one day before Pride Month the

190
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:12,669
clips that showed about steven crowder

191
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:15,159
making fun of

192
00:08:12,669 --> 00:08:17,680
were not new ones these are older clips

193
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:20,259
which made it seem like this was a

194
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,110
deliberate attack to go after Steven as

195
00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:24,729
much as possible but also in a way if I

196
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:27,279
was going after someone that was way

197
00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:28,749
bigger than me yes technically he works

198
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:30,819
under box was such a billion-dollar

199
00:08:28,749 --> 00:08:32,829
company but he didn't tweet this out

200
00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:35,200
through vogue okay he tweeted out it on

201
00:08:32,829 --> 00:08:37,690
his personal Twitter so I will if I was

202
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,029
Mozza I would probably want some sort of

203
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:42,399
support to back me up as well so in a

204
00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:44,260
way I can understand that it just seems

205
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,870
like the whole tone is more coming

206
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:49,449
across as aggressive as opposed to just

207
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:51,399
wanting to out him on his behavior mas a

208
00:08:49,449 --> 00:08:54,160
is not just going after Crowder he's

209
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:57,430
also going after YouTube directly saying

210
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,920
that YouTube has this sort of flag and

211
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:02,410
and banner in support of Pride Month but

212
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,990
in reality he thinks that YouTube does

213
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:06,310
not give it Frick about queer creators

214
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:08,500
u2 does not give a freak about

215
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:10,000
marginalized creators YouTube does not

216
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,709
give a freak about diversity or

217
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,540
inclusion you to one's clicks you to

218
00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:15,250
ones clicks you to once click now this

219
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:17,050
is either willfully ignorant or just

220
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:19,959
ignorant okay YouTube doesn't want

221
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:22,390
clicks okay YouTube has plenty of clicks

222
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:25,360
YouTube has a goddamn monopoly of clips

223
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:26,820
they don't need more clicks I don't know

224
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,079
how you can come to this conclusion

225
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:32,350
anyone working in the industry knows

226
00:09:29,079 --> 00:09:34,839
this YouTube wants to avoid at all cost

227
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:37,390
a scandal that will make them lose

228
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:39,790
advertisers which is obviously what is

229
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:41,680
trying to get stirred up here at least

230
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:43,779
that's what it seems like to me and so

231
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,760
we did Washington Post posted a

232
00:09:43,779 --> 00:09:47,860
right-wing youtuber hurled racist

233
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:50,380
homophobic taunts at a gay reporter the

234
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:52,480
company did nothing vice news saying

235
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:54,970
Google says right-wing YouTube star can

236
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,980
continue his racist and homophobic abuse

237
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,899
these are some pretty hefty headlines

238
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:01,149
YouTube decides that homophobic

239
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:03,279
harassment does not violate its policies

240
00:10:01,149 --> 00:10:04,990
YouTube may allow hate speech if it's

241
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:08,320
part of a larger argument

242
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:10,240
yikes they put likes in the title

243
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,310
that's a yikes for me now I don't think

244
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,440
I've said this but I don't agree with

245
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:15,699
Steven's comments against massa yes I'm

246
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:19,320
probably not the right person to

247
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:22,269
criticize what someone says and yes

248
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:24,670
worse things are said almost every day

249
00:10:22,269 --> 00:10:26,300
on YouTube honestly you cannot pay me to

250
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:28,939
wear one of these shirts

251
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:31,429
YouTube's response to this has been very

252
00:10:28,939 --> 00:10:34,009
interesting because it's come in three

253
00:10:31,429 --> 00:10:36,410
waves four waves number one first

254
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:38,899
YouTube says actually we reviewed all

255
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:41,029
hit Stevens content and we came to the

256
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:43,249
conclusion opinions can be deeply

257
00:10:41,029 --> 00:10:45,800
offensive but if they don't violate our

258
00:10:43,249 --> 00:10:48,499
policies they'll remain on our site so

259
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:50,720
basically YouTube saying we look into it

260
00:10:48,499 --> 00:10:52,759
they don't violate the policies and it

261
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,600
seemed like that was gonna be it but

262
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:55,850
then YouTube

263
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,939
oh my emotion darude out of nowhere and

264
00:10:55,850 --> 00:11:00,709
said update on our continued review we

265
00:10:58,939 --> 00:11:02,959
have suspended this channels

266
00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:05,329
monetization basically the monetizing

267
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:07,100
Steven Carter's entire channel we came

268
00:11:05,329 --> 00:11:09,529
to this decision because of a pattern of

269
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:11,449
egregious actions has harmed the broader

270
00:11:09,529 --> 00:11:13,550
community and is against our YouTube

271
00:11:11,449 --> 00:11:14,959
Partner Program policy this was not

272
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:17,149
enough for call us at least and he

273
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:19,610
criticized this decision by saying that

274
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:21,649
he is selling merch that says socialism

275
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:23,929
is for [ __ ] and YouTube is basically

276
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:25,720
enabling this and then YouTube responded

277
00:11:23,929 --> 00:11:28,339
to say in order to reinstate

278
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:30,290
monetization he will need to remove the

279
00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:31,999
links to his t-shirt and I think Steven

280
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:34,249
has done that already actually but then

281
00:11:31,999 --> 00:11:36,619
you to made another update Jesus Christ

282
00:11:34,249 --> 00:11:38,720
sorry for confusion this channel is to

283
00:11:36,619 --> 00:11:40,999
monetize due to continuous blah blah

284
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,670
blah to be reinstated he will need to

285
00:11:40,999 --> 00:11:47,839
address all issues with his channel all

286
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:51,290
issues will be addressed apparently to

287
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:53,240
top all of this crate like back and

288
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:55,819
forth response from YouTube first saying

289
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:58,730
all we're fine with this then saying you

290
00:11:55,819 --> 00:12:01,399
know what it's all monetized to top all

291
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:03,199
of this off YouTube I don't know where

292
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:05,980
they decided that they're gonna announce

293
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:08,569
their new policies against hate speech

294
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:11,929
YouTube's on their official blog said

295
00:12:08,569 --> 00:12:15,619
our ongoing work to tackle hate ah the

296
00:12:11,929 --> 00:12:17,929
same day the same goddamn day they did

297
00:12:15,619 --> 00:12:20,240
this this left a lot of people confuse

298
00:12:17,929 --> 00:12:22,730
okay a lot of people seem to think that

299
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,929
these two think the events are coin site

300
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:26,209
is that a word

301
00:12:23,929 --> 00:12:28,040
sure YouTube has been planning this for

302
00:12:26,209 --> 00:12:30,019
a long time okay they don't just change

303
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,309
their policies on a whim although I

304
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:34,040
guess they have in the past actually

305
00:12:31,309 --> 00:12:36,139
basically what this new policy is saying

306
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:38,419
is that they're gonna go strike harder

307
00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:39,209
on hateful content saying that they're

308
00:12:38,419 --> 00:12:41,100
gonna remove hate

309
00:12:39,209 --> 00:12:43,499
the premise content from YouTube saying

310
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:45,449
that they're gonna prohibit videos

311
00:12:43,499 --> 00:12:47,850
alleging that a group is superior in

312
00:12:45,449 --> 00:12:50,160
order to justify discrimination and

313
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:52,709
they're gonna remove videos denying

314
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,329
well-documented violent events and I

315
00:12:52,709 --> 00:12:56,910
gotta say I'm all for this this is a

316
00:12:54,329 --> 00:12:59,519
good update I don't really have a

317
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:01,889
problem with this previously YouTube has

318
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,290
dealt with this type of content and at

319
00:13:01,889 --> 00:13:05,910
putting it in a locked state where

320
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:07,949
basically you can't engage with the

321
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:11,269
video no comment no likes no nothing

322
00:13:07,949 --> 00:13:13,829
it's still technically on the site but

323
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:15,449
not really but now they're striking

324
00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:20,069
harder on it and saying okay we're just

325
00:13:15,449 --> 00:13:22,050
gonna remove it and great sure remove

326
00:13:20,069 --> 00:13:24,059
hateful content I don't care but this

327
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:25,850
led a lot of people thinking okay this

328
00:13:24,059 --> 00:13:28,079
is because of Carlos thing and now

329
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:29,910
because of him all these channels are

330
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,259
getting to monetize now because of this

331
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:33,290
it seemed like journalists that we're

332
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:36,420
posting videos in the context of

333
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:37,379
criticizing this type of content got

334
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:39,269
striked as well

335
00:13:37,379 --> 00:13:41,970
even this History Channel got

336
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:43,949
demonetised completely and banned for

337
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:45,929
hate speech because apparently had some

338
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:47,610
Nazi propaganda speeches in it I'm

339
00:13:45,929 --> 00:13:50,189
devastated to have this claim leveled

340
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:52,290
against me and frustrated that 15 years

341
00:13:50,189 --> 00:13:55,199
of material for history teacher

342
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:57,509
community had ended so abruptly Jesus

343
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:59,429
Christ an update to this they did

344
00:13:57,509 --> 00:14:01,920
reinstate his channel but why the hell

345
00:13:59,429 --> 00:14:03,990
does this always happen why do all these

346
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,420
channels get them on so old frequently

347
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:08,129
this channel unjustly get demonetized

348
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:10,110
when it's someone's livelihood someone's

349
00:14:08,129 --> 00:14:13,709
I worked on something for 15 years

350
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:17,279
YouTube has human people initiating the

351
00:14:13,709 --> 00:14:19,920
final strike do a better job please

352
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,389
delete hateful comment by old means but

353
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,480
then at least make sure you know what

354
00:14:21,389 --> 00:14:27,179
hateful comment content is now whatever

355
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,490
your opinion about masa or Steven I

356
00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:32,069
think what really matters here is the

357
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:33,689
effect okay there's definitely even

358
00:14:32,069 --> 00:14:36,720
tighter restrictions here on YouTube

359
00:14:33,689 --> 00:14:38,249
many people pointed out how obviously

360
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,259
since Steven is a right-wing Channel and

361
00:14:38,249 --> 00:14:42,299
Carlos is a left-wing Channel people

362
00:14:40,259 --> 00:14:44,939
started pointing out the hypocrisy in

363
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:46,799
the enforcement of the policies because

364
00:14:44,939 --> 00:14:49,139
a lot of people from the right saying

365
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:52,010
well people on the Left have actually

366
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:54,170
said way worse why don't they get it get

367
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:57,110
demonetized but because of this whole

368
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:59,480
event we have it now spelled out more

369
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:02,810
clearly that YouTube even themselves

370
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:05,000
said even if a creators content doesn't

371
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:06,890
violate our Community Guidelines we will

372
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,660
take a look at the broader context and

373
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:10,070
impact and if their behavior is

374
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:12,530
egregious and harms the broader

375
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:14,420
community we may take action so if you

376
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:16,160
make it it's not about who's right and

377
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:18,680
wrong it's about who makes the most

378
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:21,560
amount of noise and that's what Carlos

379
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:24,020
managed to do again I don't agree with

380
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:27,650
Stevens comment about it but if YouTube

381
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:30,350
it's so bizarre to me how it's not about

382
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:32,480
the what policies it is because the

383
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:35,510
policies against harassment and bullying

384
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,700
would take down way more content than

385
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:39,950
just this it happens all the time when

386
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:41,930
you do fine alone as someone who's been

387
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:44,210
attacked by the mainstream media steven

388
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:47,000
is most likely just going to benefit

389
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:49,100
from all of this happening ironically it

390
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:55,120
is the Streisand effect and that's just

391
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:55,120
how it works now today in awesome news

392
00:15:55,930 --> 00:16:07,010
Ella had the baby hey Ethan Aniela

393
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:08,390

00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:29,330

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,940
million followers struggles to sell 36

403
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:33,590
t-shirts ah this was going viral on

404
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:35,660
Twitter with hundred and fifteen

405
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:38,390
thousand likes the influencer bubble is

406
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:40,640
bursting this young lady has well over 2

407
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:43,430
million followers and couldn't sell 36

408
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:45,530
shirts Jesus Christ it breaks my heart

409
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:47,330
to have to write this post I poured my

410
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:49,610
heart into this drop for my photo shoot

411
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:52,040
I flew out a photographer and makeup

412
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:55,100
artist okay well it doesn't look that

413
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:57,230
good there's a lot of things that go

414
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,860
into selling mark I haven't released

415
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:59,870
merch

416
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:02,030
many years ago where I had more than 2

417
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:03,410
million followers that's sold like 50 or

418
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:04,620
something like that because it was

419
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:06,449
either boring design

420
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:09,480
or people just didn't care enough about

421
00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:12,180
it where I marketed it poorly now I sell

422
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:15,329
merch very ethically because people

423
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:17,819
actually care about what merry hem has

424
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:20,459
to say and they actually listen to him

425
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:22,470

428
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:30,150
that freaking hard on the idea that the

429
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:32,670
influencer bubble is bursting it just

430
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:34,140
sounds so goddamn stupid I will say

431
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:38,280
though there seems to be so many

432
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:42,059
Instagram in influencers don't pay them

433
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:44,120

434
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:46,830
