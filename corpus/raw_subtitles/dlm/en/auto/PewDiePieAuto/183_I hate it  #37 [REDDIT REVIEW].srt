8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,199
the boundaries on what is content here

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,039

reddit it's called awful taste but

16
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,480
great execution for everything that

17
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,200
displays

18
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,160
quality craftsmanship in the least

19
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,280
elegant way

20
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,280
possible it's basically as if you were

21
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,120
extremely talented at something

22
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,800
that no one cares about that's

23
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,920
essentially this reddit a woman

24
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,640
crocheted

25
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,039

26
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,280
dog

27
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,320
see i saw the dog first and then i look

28
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,800

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,559
of god would you do that

31
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,600
that takes a long ass time to do that as

32
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,920
well why

33
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,439
would you do that you don't just wake up

34
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,080
one day morning and go

35
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,640
i'm gonna crochet not just myself but my

36
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,720
dog

37
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,680
and it's gonna be epic you know if she

38
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,920
did it for the meme

39
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,799
i can understand but you know she didn't

40
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,360
do it for the mean

41
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:24,000
so there will be no respect for me okay

42
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,560
a long time lurker then i saw this

43
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,640

101
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,879
