00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:08,230
[Music]

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,960
how's it going bro

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,759
my name is and today we're looking at

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,759
sushant

5
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,600
singh raiput now i'm not going to

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,279
pretend like i knew who this guy was

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,199
but i recently found out about him and i

8
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,600
talked about him in a video in it and so

9
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,920
many

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,720
people freaked out this guy is a big

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,160
deal i

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,279
just watched some videos of him and i

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,560
thought he would seem like a really

14
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,640
interesting dude

15
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,599
unfortunately he passed away about a

16
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,520
month ago

17
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,280
so i just wanted to make this video to

18
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,120
kind of tribute him and

19
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,960
bring attention to him in his life if

20
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,559
that makes sense i don't know

21
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,000
i just think he's a cool dude i'm not

22
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,320
gonna pretend like oh i was the biggest

23
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,399
fan

24
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,360
no i had no idea who he was but i like

25
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,440
what i've seen

26
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,520
now for those who don't know he was a

27
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,320
big actor he was in movies like

28
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,079
detective biam keshi bakshi you ever

29
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,079
seen that one

30
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,120
he was big in india in bollywood

31
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,000
basically

32
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,480
uh he got a nomination for best actor

33
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,559
and

34
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,640
he's been in commercially successful

35
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:07,920
films like kedarnath

36
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,159
and yeah

37
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,119
his acting is cool enough all right but

38
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,799
i think what

39
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,560
is more impressive about him is the fact

40
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,119
that he's actually really smart

41
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,920
i found out that he was ranked number

42
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,720
seven

43
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,280
in the engineering exams in of all of

44
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,280
india

45
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,799
not bad i used to study engineering

46
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,400
myself so

47
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,560
i remember i was pride when i got the

48
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,640
highest out of 200 people

49
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,759
uh i feel like out of all of india it's

50
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,759
a little bit more of a

51
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,040
more of an achievement and he also what

52
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,040
i like about him

53
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,159
he came from humble beginnings as well

54
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,399
i'm not gonna try and force

55
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,159
like oh with this name it's i'm saying i

56
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,079
can relate to him that's all

57
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,520
like it's anything the same growing up

58
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,040
in sweden and india

59
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,799
sorry i just realized how this sounds

60
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,240
like

61
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:57,600
he was also national olympiad winner in

62
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,360
physics what smart dude basically

63
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,680
uh and you can tell just by listening to

64
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:05,280
him apparently i saw here he worked for

65
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:07,280
uh kapoor remember her that [ __ ] dumb

66
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,840
thing

67
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,080
i noticed uh sushant followed me on

68
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,680
instagram and i was so confused by it

69
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,760
i wonder if it was because i trolled

70
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,560
ekta i don't know

71
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,040
regardless he dropped that engineering i

72
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,840
dropped that

73
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,040
engineering to pursue his dream uh to

74
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,599
work in show business

75
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,319
and uh one of the videos the first one i

76
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,239
saw of him was

77
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,360
when he did this university talk which i

78
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,560
thought was super interesting and i

79
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,840
wanted to share with you guys today

80
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,160
because i think he had a lot of

81
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,280
really valuable lessons on life uh so

82
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,560
let's watch it

83
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,760
excuse me if i don't make sense excuse

84
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,640
me if i get a panic attack right now

85
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,640
but i'll try my best

86
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:51,120
[Applause]

87
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:55,760
yeah i became an actor because i had

88
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:58,720
a problem i was an introvert

89
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:01,200
you know i'm the youngest in my family

90
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:05,120
and i was so pampered in

91
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:07,920
my heart that when i used to step out i

92
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,720
didn't know how to deal with people so i

93
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,879
i

94
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,400
gradually i became this very shy

95
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:16,840
introvert kid

96
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:19,519
who could not talk well i still cannot

97
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,920
talk

98
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,120
here i go here i insert myself again i

99
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,120
can just relate to it

100
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,280
i was such an introvert as well i still

101
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,920
am but i found this medium through

102
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,159
youtube

103
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,560
to be extroverted and be this character

104
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,840
it's just been so fun i guess he got the

105
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,440
same way through acting

106
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,440
all right i would love to share my

107
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,480
journey with you my learning so in case

108
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,280
you decide to drop

109
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,599
out and join me in bollywood it will

110
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:48,080
come very handy

111
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:50,400
so i was thinking in the car what do i

112
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,480
talk about wait this guy wrote the

113
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,959
script for what he was gonna speak to

114
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,480
university on the car on the way there

115
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,319
that's impossible

116
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:02,159
but after deep clicking i i i zeroed

117
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,000
down into two things that i can actually

118
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:07,040
discuss about

119
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,920
these two things talk about

120
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,959
chasing your dreams and actually living

121
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,080
your dreams

122
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:16,400
which unfortunately nobody mentioned

123
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,600
to me when i was starting out that's

124
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,600
funny because i had the

125
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,440
absolute opposite advice given to me

126
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,160
people were like follow your dreams

127
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,919
pick what you want and i'm like nah i'm

128
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:30,240
gonna pick the job i hate

129
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:34,880
because money so those two things are

130
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:38,479
the biggest lie and the only truth

131
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,240
about success that i was told about

132
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,520
i don't remember what it said but i'll

133
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,479
tell you what i think

134
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,759
is that success has way more importance

135
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,320
i know it's easy for me to say

136
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,040
this but i think people put way too much

137
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,960
importance

138
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,080
on success itself if you're having fun

139
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,759
with what you're doing

140
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,840
then you're already successful and you

141
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,520
can sustain yourself anything beyond

142
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,720
that it's just unnecessary

143
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:05,440
i think at least money

144
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:07,919
plus recognition is equal to happiness

145
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,120
is equal to success was that the lie

146
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,960
because i totally agree

147
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,199
i feel like such a broken record because

148
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,400
i think i've said this so many times and

149
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,479
every time i say it

150
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,400
everyone gets so mad and i get it

151
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:21,520
everyone's situation is different

152
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,759
but it is a general assumption in

153
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,440
society that these things will lead to

154
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,840
happiness i'll just be

155
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,440
extra clear when i say this obviously if

156
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,479
you can't afford to pay your rent and

157
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,240
all these things yeah

158
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,840
it will help you you will get happier if

159
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,720
you get it but i'm speaking money and

160
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,039
excess

161
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,080
money and its multitude what people

162
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,080
dream about

163
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,240
people imagine what would it be like if

164
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,759
i had so much money like millions what

165
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,280
would i do that'd be crazy

166
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,560
you know people love to fantasize about

167
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,199
these things that's why the lottery

168
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,120
exists

169
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,400
and people like to find science what it

170
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,520
would mean to be

171
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:56,800
recognized or some someone of notoriety

172
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:59,280
and we generally see hollywood stars

173
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,319
shiny and smilingly and all that stuff

174
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,360
when it happens

175
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:05,919
absolutely nothing to do with that

176
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,600
uh your happiness i think so at least

177
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,479
obviously people react differently to

178
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,479
different things but

179
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,759
they are literally things that are just

180
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,600
like anything else

181
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,199
after a while they're not going to be as

182
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,039
appealing anymore there are

183
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,400
sensational pleasures essentially

184
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,160
they'll flee away

185
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,520
so let me begin by mentioning that i

186
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,880
come from a very

187
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,160
uh middle-class family and when i was

188
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,560
growing up

189
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,280
money was a big big big difference in my

190
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,280
life

191
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,759
same for me because my parents were so

192
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,520
successful they made a lot of money but

193
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,120
uh and i always felt like oh god i need

194
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,759
to live up to their standards i need to

195
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,919
get a job

196
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,039
just so i can be like them i know like

197
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,240
boohoo me right

198
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,880
i'm just saying there was a lot of

199
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,319
pressure to perform well in that regard

200
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,840
and it wasn't until i decided you know

201
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,160
what i'm just gonna go on my own path

202
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,360
where

203
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:54,160
i actually found a lot more of it

204
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,479
ironically generations of my family that

205
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,360
i

206
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,759
know of that are documented nobody knew

207
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,360
what

208
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:05,599
fame uh felt like so basically

209
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:07,520
uh both uh money and recognition

210
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,280
were missing when i started out so i

211
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:13,039
already started out as a failure

212
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:17,840
let me be very precise my family told me

213
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:17,840
that i had to become an engineer

214
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,800
examination and then probably yeah that

215
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,319
would be

216
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,840
like opening the doors for all kinds of

217
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,560
happiness and i'll be forever

218
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,080
successful i'll be forever happy this is

219
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:42,240
the action

220
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:45,520
that i experienced

221
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:48,319
all right fair enough sweden or india

222
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,000
it's the same apparently that's so funny

223
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,199
but right so i became very good in

224
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,919
studies

225
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,400
did fairly well in my time board exams

226
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,479
and then

227
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,000
off i went to delhi for my classroom got

228
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:01,039
myself a drawn in a nice

229
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,240
school and uh with them there and

230
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:07,680
fiji and half a dozen of our

231
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,120
other coaching institutes and i used to

232
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,319
share my room with three other similar

233
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,440
aspirants

234
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,400
what it meant was every day after

235
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,400
finishing my

236
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,160
assignment school assignments and

237
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,120
preparing for my engineering entrance

238
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,879
exam

239
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,280
i had to wash my clothes and i had to

240
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,919
cook

241
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:30,400
food for myself i wasn't complaining

242
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:33,120
well it was worth it because after all i

243
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:36,159
was for the very first time in my life

244
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:39,200
i was so close to become

245
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,399
successful for the first time in my life

246
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,120
so yeah

247
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,959
finally i slopped i got selected for

248
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,800
several engineering colleges

249
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:49,600
and i decided to take a mission in delhi

250
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:55,839
college of engineering which is crazy

251
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:55,839
now known as gtu thank you

252
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,800
it's funny i got into my university

253
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,839
through entrance exams as well which i

254
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,720
worked really hard for

255
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,480
and it was like i got in it's crazy how

256
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,160
similar experience we had and i thought

257
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,560
as well like damn i made it like now

258
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,640
it's a smooth sailing from here

259
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,240
i could finally stop for a while and

260
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,959
breathe you know

261
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,880
i was telling myself that you know what

262
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,399
now you're made

263
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,880
you should be happy because you're

264
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,040
supposed to be happy

265
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,640
but it wasn't working that much

266
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,880
something was missing there was a void

267
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:34,080
that i could feel

268
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:37,040
so i i thought maybe something bigger

269
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,600
was required for some reason for some

270
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,160
reason

271
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,600
incidentally while uh the first 18 19

272
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:45,040
years of my life

273
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:48,240
the future of me was much happier

274
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:50,399
much successful than the president made

275
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,279
so like all right so i was forcing

276
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,360
myself

277
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,680
i promised uh as i promised i started

278
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,320
preparing the civil services examination

279
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,200
and i was forcing myself to slaughter uh

280
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,200
but i was bored

281
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:05,680
um exams were still far away

282
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,480
and the main time i thought of doing

283
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,959
theater and

284
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,920
uh i thought to learn dance because to

285
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:13,680
counter the

286
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:15,279
the shyness that i had still have

287
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:19,839
and also because there were no girls in

288
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,839
my engineering college for some reason

289
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,480
yeah so somebody told me that they are

290
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:32,720
very good-looking girls in

291
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:34,320
dance schools so i was like fine

292
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,920
there you have it just pick up dancing

293
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,760
and you'll meet girl scout

294
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,000
there you have it once i started

295
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:43,440
performing art

296
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,440
i knew one thing for sure

297
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:50,000
i knew that i quite liked it

298
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,440
and three years later imagine me sitting

299
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,880
in the campus

300
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:57,600
and i'm thinking all right i'm very

301
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:00,800
interested in performing arts

302
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:03,920
and all i want to do is to earn money

303
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:06,640
and to be recognized so if i become a

304
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,640
movie star

305
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,760
hmm i actually was very serious and i

306
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,760
dropped out of my couch

307
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:19,600
[Music]

308
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:21,440
no way he was that close wow

309
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,279
yeah i dropped that way sooner because

310
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,959
obviously i found youtube and i was

311
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:27,200
enjoying that so much more that

312
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,320
didn't feel like i lost to drop out the

313
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,920
idea was to just

314
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,480
quit quit school for a year and then

315
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,480
i'll come back

316
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:38,880
yep got heavily into theatre

317
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,680
and also the skills that i thought were

318
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,200
necessary

319
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,240
to become an actor and by the way this

320
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,120
time i stayed with

321
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:50,560
six other guys in a single room kitchen

322
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:53,440
but this time i was prepared for it

323
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,760
this time there was one difference i was

324
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,760
driven

325
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,399
that folks in engineering and b schools

326
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,880
should never become

327
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,399
so i had to prove a point to everybody i

328
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,920
had to prove a point

329
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:23,040
to my family most importantly

330
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:25,760
i had to prove a point to myself

331
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,440
and this was the time when i was also a

332
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,160
background dancer

333
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,800
so i was dancing behind all the possible

334
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,959
stars that you can think of

335
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,160
everybody and i was thinking i was

336
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,000
thinking to myself while i was

337
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:41,680
performing okay it's just three steps

338
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,079
away there and

339
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,839
everything will be solid and i kept

340
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:49,120
going like that

341
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:52,480
and two years later guess what

342
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:55,440
i got myself my first big break

343
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,880
i was selected for a prime time show on

344
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,959
a tv

345
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,920
now hear me out was a seriously a big

346
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:03,519
break

347
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:06,480
because i started earning right people

348
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:09,600
started recognizing me

349
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:20,320
to be honest i would deliberately go and

350
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:23,040
roam in all these malls

351
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,680
that's funny i don't think i've ever

352
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,680
done that done

353
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,440
i guess i did i did go on like make

354
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,800
videos where i broke his people

355
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,800
i also suddenly discovered that

356
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,959
i actually had many friends i'm like

357
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,720
what absent all this while but suddenly

358
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:42,000
they popped up

359
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,480
crazy how that works i was making good

360
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,920
money

361
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:48,240
to a point that money

362
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,480
stopped being a differentiator in my

363
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,839
life

364
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,560
[Music]

365
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,040
and i was becoming more and more popular

366
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,519
now

367
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,320
i cannot go to all these malls that i

368
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,160
was going

369
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,760
all alone right so i wanted somebody to

370
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,680
be with me to save me

371
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,360
that's the thing you don't realize first

372
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,720
time you get recognized is amazing you

373
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,639
love it it's so cool and that's

374
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,560
an experience everyone wants to feel but

375
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,680
then you almost feel isolated where you

376
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,079
can't go to

377
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,199
malls and you can't go to closely packed

378
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,920
areas anymore

379
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:17,040
you just feel like an alien it's very uh

380
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,240
limiting

381
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:23,920
the first dream house

382
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:27,199
i bought myself my dream car

383
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,839
and just a note volvo xc90 thank you

384
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,680
very much

385
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:34,000
to you as well i was getting such

386
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,360
female attention that my engineering

387
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,519
college friends

388
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:44,320
could only possibly fail got em

389
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:48,000
got em man

390
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:52,399
so i was having a time of my life

391
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,399
and then something unusual happened

392
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:59,440
i got used to everything

393
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:03,279
i felt cheated i stayed with

394
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:05,680
all these dreams for 10 and 15 years of

395
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:08,880
my life

396
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:11,040
i was promised happiness and i was

397
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:14,320
promised success

398
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:18,160
but all these things stayed with me

399
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,560
just for few days right i'm punctuating

400
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,600
me

401
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:24,880
because i started from zero money

402
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,800
and zero recognition so i was not happy

403
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,839
how could that it be

404
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:33,199
i didn't like this version of success

405
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:35,199
and the future me again was luring the

406
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:39,360
present me

407
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:43,279
but this time i decided

408
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,279
otherwise i would do something else

409
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,759
so that gets us to the second point

410
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,519
which is the only truth

411
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,600
yeah i think he said it pretty well it's

412
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,079
like he imagined these things happening

413
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,079
for 10

414
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,600
15 years of his life and then they

415
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,120
disappear in a couple days and i think

416
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,680
that's it they're nice to have and

417
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,600
everyone

418
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,880
wants to experience it but they don't

419
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,959
last and we put

420
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:07,839
way too much importance to them it's a

421
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:10,000
fantasy it's always greater in our head

422
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:12,720
i won't take too much time i'll just try

423
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,360
to keep it shut

424
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,199
i figured something i figured that

425
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:21,279
something

426
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:25,040
seemingly big things were not that big

427
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:28,320
once i got them and looking back

428
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:31,839
in the past i realized that

429
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:34,560
maybe smaller things were way bigger

430
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,519
and there was one thing that was missing

431
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:39,040
in my life

432
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:42,560
that was the cause of this illusion

433
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:46,160
and that thing that was missing

434
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:48,240
was now so true

435
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,000
yes i'll let him finish his sentence and

436
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,120
then i'll say what i want to say

437
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,160
i was all these years

438
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,560
just i was obsessed about what's going

439
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,560
to happen

440
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,880
we are taught in schools but if this

441
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,760
happens i'll do that

442
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:08,000
and uh six months from now i'll be here

443
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,439
so i wanted to be in control i was so

444
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,199
obsessed about my future oh my gosh

445
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,919
taking the entire responsibility about

446
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,480
the past

447
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,559
but all i was doing was frequently

448
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,280
swinging from past to future

449
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:20,480
i noticed the words he used control and

450
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,559
the presence or the

451
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,720
or now he was always looking for the

452
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,319
next thing and that's the problem with

453
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,000
with money and fame like

454
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,440
you will never have enough of it it's

455
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,720
something that you can chase forever but

456
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,799
there will never be enough

457
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,240
but i also think in general you know one

458
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,080
thing i noticed especially here on

459
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,880
youtube it's these channels that

460
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,240
make uh routine videos where they say oh

461
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,640
we wake up i wake up at

462
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,400
six i sleep four hours and then from six

463
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,559
to seven i do this and seven to eight i

464
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,400
do this and then and then

465
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,480
on and on and on and on and on and on

466
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,679
and i i get that those videos are very

467
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,840
inspiring

468
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,120
but being so focused on the things you

469
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,960
need to do constantly

470
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,120
seems like a nightmare to me i and i

471
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,559
think it's the illusion of control which

472
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,400
is what he said you want to think that

473
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:04,640
you have control over your future

474
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,240
when in reality it doesn't matter

475
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,039
happiness comes from the moment

476
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,160
and personally as well the more i find

477
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:12,559
myself in the moment

478
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,320
the better i'm doing it as a person i

479
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:16,320
really really strongly believe that

480
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,480
uh we always have this dream that we

481
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,360
want to chase oh if i do this then i'll

482
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,120
be happy

483
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,400
oh if i reach this goal then i'll be

484
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,880
happy what about now

485
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,320
anyone no matter who you are should be

486
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,080
able to be happy in the moment

487
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,520
that's the goal of life that's what we

488
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,240
should try and aim for

489
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:34,080
there's no always gracious greener or

490
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,840
situation that will make you feel better

491
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,120
why not just be happy now your life will

492
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,880
never be perfect

493
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,880
just recognize that and be happy for

494
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,000
what you have if you're in the moment

495
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,160
you immediately

496
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,679
realize and become thankful for the

497
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,039
things you do have instead of the things

498
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,840
that you don't have at least that's what

499
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,520
i notice

500
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,120
and i think meditating is a really good

501
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,640
technique to do that

502
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,559
but there are other ways as well of

503
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,080
course sorry this became a whole big

504
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:58,000
rant but i find that uh

505
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,600
especially today with it's so easy to

506
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
get distracted by things

507
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,440
you can occupy your mind constantly but

508
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,400
i think it's important to set away some

509
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,240
time to just

510
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:10,480
do nothing focus on nothing and that's

511
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,039
what puts you in the moment i also

512
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,240
figured

513
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:15,919
that when i perform on stage or in front

514
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,039
of camera

515
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:25,840
i am so much excited i am so much

516
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:25,840
interested i am

517
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:37,650
[Music]

518
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:42,080
and for the first time trust me in a

519
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,320
long time

520
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:47,039
i understood the true meaning of success

521
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:51,600
which was not

522
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:55,039
money plus recognition but it was

523
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:58,080
now plus excitement

524
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,720
i love this guy so much such a great

525
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,000
dude

526
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:05,200
now let me share another day's shots uh

527
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,760
story with you when i was in school four

528
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,480
to 5

529
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:10,720
30 p.m was the time and i was allowed to

530
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:14,080
go out and play

531
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,600
i was asked to be an engineer but the

532
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,640
entire day i was

533
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,559
i used to wait for 4pm to happen i would

534
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,240
step out and the next one and a half

535
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:25,360
hours

536
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,360
felt like five minutes

537
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:32,960
i didn't understand uh this then

538
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:36,000
but now wait honestly very confidently

539
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:39,039
i can tell you this that i am

540
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:49,600
living that 4 to 5

541
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:52,080
30 life right now since

542
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,280
cause and effects i know are not

543
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,320
different

544
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:58,240
excitement is the cause excitement is

545
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:01,280
the effect

546
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,080
i get hired again and again because all

547
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,120
these success

548
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:06,720
mantras that we talk about you know hard

549
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:10,400
work belief

550
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:13,280
focus vision risk taken talent

551
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:15,440
perseverance we can go on and on but all

552
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:18,240
these success mantras

553
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,960
are now the side effects of the process

554
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,000
itself

555
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,520
i'm so engaged i'm so it commands my

556
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,960
attention so much

557
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,520
that there is nothing else that you can

558
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:30,559
think about so hard work doesn't

559
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:32,559
feel it feels like hard work and there's

560
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:35,679
nothing else that you can do but to

561
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:37,520

00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:49,039
so here i am right now five years

me calling me recently

576
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:15,280
about asking me to plan this interaction

577
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,080

[Applause]

583
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:42,960
so good sorry i know this is very long

584
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,679
but he's such a cool dude such a smart

585
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,159
guy

586
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,840
such a good message as well i that i so

587
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:50,240
wholeheartedly believe in

588
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:52,159
just such a tragedy it really makes you

589
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,559
sad to think that he passed away

590
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,480
at such a young age and i think i

591
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:58,559
mentioned before in a video because

592
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,320
the police say he died from suicide and

593
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,039
at least personally someone that lives

594
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,360
in the moment

595
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:04,320
i cannot make sense out of committing

596
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,520
suicide

597
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,159
and there's a bit there's been this

598
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:10,080
whole controversy and and uh

599
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,840
theories about did he really what

600
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,280
happened people don't know and i don't

601
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,120
really want to get into that i wanted

602
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,720
this to just be a video of attributing

603
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,799
him because i think he's a cool dude

604
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,720
and i wanted to share with my audience

605
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,000
but yeah it's just this statement he had

606
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,919
about living in the moment i

607
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,039
obviously this was a couple years ago

608
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,559
but it this

609
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,240
you wouldn't commit suicide if you had

610
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:30,640
this mindset it just

611
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,360
i don't believe that at all i really

612
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,120
don't

613
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,720
uh but then again yeah it is a couple

614
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,520
years ago and i don't want to add things

615
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,280
to that but

616
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,600
that's just how i felt while listening

617
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,240
to it rest in peace or sean i would love

618
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,320

619
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,000

623
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,480
bit different but that's it for now
