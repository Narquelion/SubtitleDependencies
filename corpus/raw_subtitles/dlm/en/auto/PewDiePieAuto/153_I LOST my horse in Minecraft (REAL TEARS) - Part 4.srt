89
00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:48,229
you're supposed to row a boat backwards

90
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:50,419
so this game isn't that historically

91
00:04:48,229 --> 00:04:51,800
accurate after all okay

92
00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:53,330

93
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,120

what I thought all right we're making

103
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:19,389
