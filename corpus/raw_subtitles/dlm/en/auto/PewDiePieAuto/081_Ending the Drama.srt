she's a crossbreed though so she'll

268

270
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,200
she looks super cute like a little puppy

271
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:34,240

shout out to an irish

284
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,519
small irish youtuber the rest is oh the

285
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,120
modern [ __ ] i don't even know this

286
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,399
guy seems crazy i really

287
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:08,200
i did an impression of whatever

288
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:10,959
it is he's doing dude he only had

289
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,320
244 views on that video was that a

290
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,519
reason upfront

291
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,920
he seemed really funny his name is

292
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:19,200
jacksepticeye

293
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,959
you should check him out that's nuts

294
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,279
uh i definitely want to do another one

295
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,680
of these because i did the video where i

296
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:27,040
i donated to twitch streamers or

297
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,000
whatever and i think a lot of people

298
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,800
were like oh he's really

299
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,440
cheap he only donates 69 which is like

300
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,680
well

301
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,519
yeah people need money but i think if i

302
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,200
i was thinking like okay i remember when

303
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,880
i started off what really bothered me

304
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,959
was that not enough people were watching

305
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,800
and it was so hard to grow your audience

306
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,320
it's like teach a man to fish kind of

307
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,920
thing like if you give someone a shout

308
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,480
out that can really boost off to

309
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,560
to get your career going instead of just

310
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,639
giving a bit of cash which is fine too

311
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,240
i'm not hitting on that but i also think

312
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,720
people put way too much

313
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,760
value and money in general and it

314
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,720
becomes the whole thing every time i

315
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,519
bring it up so i don't have to talk

316
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,639

402
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,959
those are you sleeping with your eyes

403
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,480
openly

404
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,320
are you pretending are you pretending to

405
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,760
watch the weirdest [ __ ] i've ever

406
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,399
experienced as a sweet is when

407
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,519
around mid oh i remember this yeah mid

408
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,279
20s

409
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,279
2000s it became popular sweet for

410
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:32,079
teenage boys to wear rubber bands

411
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,759
around their legs on top of their jeans

412
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:36,520
the more rubber bands you had

413
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:38,320
and variety in colors the more alpha

414
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:42,959
[Laughter]

415
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,959
you became to the other teenage boys

416
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,079
oh that's freaking funny it's true

417
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,320
because yeah

418
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:52,320
and then mid-2000s how old was i then it

419
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,440
was like i think i was in seventh grade

420
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,920
and it was like the time

421
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,360
where you start picking your own outfits

422
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,160
and your mom doesn't buy your clothes

423
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,000
anymore

424
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,680
at least for me in my age so a lot of

425
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,880
people just started

426
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,160
doing this and uh it you would have

427
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,600
this guy's doing it wrong though you

428
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,120
would have like baggy pants and then at

429
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,600
the bottom you would just like

430
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,959
strap it in so it it would look cool but

431
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,199
then you have the people that are

432
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,480
morons who think they're alpha that way

433
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,560
overboard with it

434
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,759
and it's not that weird as well because

435
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,759
uh i think people

436
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,360
that ride motorcycles do this so that

437
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,000
their pants won't get tangled in the

438
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,399
wheel

439
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,680
it has a utility purpose but obviously

440
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,680
it was just a dumb trend

441
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,199
i think the dumber trend in sweden and

442
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,040
i'm talking about this way too much

443
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:35,759
was when every [ __ ] on the

444
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:38,959
planet had the exact same sweatshirt

445
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,519
it was gl only swedes will get this

446
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,279

447
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,720
maybe you maybe for some re maybe this

448
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,240
is like the swedish pancakes

449
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,639

pew news is done it's done i already had

528
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,280
the idea

529
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,440
that i wanted to stop doing covering

530
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,000
drama it was fun while i last said but i

531
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,480
think

532
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,840
i realized just drama is great for views

533
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,840
and it's great for continent

534
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,840
and it's fun i'm not going to pretend

535
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:01,200
i'm above all drama but also

536
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:03,280
i find it just not productive and

537
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,360
as someone that's been trying to work on

538
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,720
myself over the past couple months

539
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,159

540
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,880
the [ __ ] other people are doing and i i

541
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,640

give that energy to other people as well

543
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,760
fix yourself first and then you can

544
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,679
start giving a [ __ ] about

545
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,760
what other people are doing is

546
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,799
