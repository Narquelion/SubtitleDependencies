15
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:35,610

there's no game stores to open right now

20
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:55,930

21
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:57,370
gone to the game so it's funny huh seven

22
00:00:55,930 --> 00:01:00,280
years later I still have a crappy

23
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:01,690
internet I was like god dammit it's

25
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:03,730

29
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,729
I loved the first game it was one of the

30
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:12,190
biggest playthroughs I've ever done on

31
00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:16,750
this channel I've been getting messages

32
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:20,530
for weeks literally asking me yes I'm

33
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:24,040

34
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:25,869
am delivering that's right probably the

35
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,300
most anticipated game in a very long

36
00:01:25,869 --> 00:01:29,800
time when I played this game last of us

37
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,539
for the first time it was a special time

38
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,039
for me because it was when I was just

39
00:01:31,539 --> 00:01:36,490
about to become the biggest channel on

40
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:38,410
YouTube because I I don't get excited

41
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:40,210
for games very often and I've been

42
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:42,280
extremely excited for this one I'd

43
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:44,130
literally be counting the youtubes and I

44
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,810
was neck or neck with this other channel

45
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:48,880
and I was a bit worried about it I

46
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:52,330
thought I only get one chance in this in

47
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,979
my life I need to deliver and then this

48
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:56,710
game came out and delivered for me cuz

49
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:59,830
it was massive for the channel so thanks

50
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:01,780

615
00:48:45,150 --> 00:48:53,999
