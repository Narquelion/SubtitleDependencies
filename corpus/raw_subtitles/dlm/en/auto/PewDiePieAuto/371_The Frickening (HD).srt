140
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,840

162
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:49,280
at the checkpoints

163
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:51,680

169
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:07,520
sam also reviews bad games

170
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,360

172
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,160
your money

173
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,759
sam really cares about you instead of

174
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,280
reviewing a good game i thought i'd

175
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,319
review a bad game

176
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,160
so people will know not to play it

177
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,680
you know you're the benders of the

178
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,919
skylanders franchise

179
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,919
then

180
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:28,560
[Music]

181
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:32,160

[Music]

184
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:39,519
and then overall score zero out of ten

185
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,039
it's sad to see what happened to spyro

186
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,240
we've had a lot of buildup

187
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,800
we understand now to understand a man's

188
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,040
thought

189
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,880
to understand a man's pain we must

190
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,680
understand where these thoughts come

191
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,080
from

192
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,880

197
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:05,360

[Music]

203
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,640
i never seen a more compelling argument

204
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,640
for anything in my entire life

205
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,200

reason a demon a demon grows inside this

208
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:48,320

211
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,040
idiots

212
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,959
i'm so thankful that this exists can you

213
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,200
argue with that

214
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:07,680
you can't and that's not all people say

215
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:09,279
sonic is unappealing to the eye really

216
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,040
i'm pretty sure with all the sonic fan

217
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,640
fiction art that i've seen i don't think

218
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,320
people would say that

219
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,160
sonic is not appealing to the eye i

220
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,440
don't think anyone can make that point

221
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:23,279
isn't that enough

222
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,279
let it out sami let the demon out

223
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,680
it's basically me if i started making

224
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,440
videos

225
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,440
like three years earlier than i did

226
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:47,839
i know our games are still good yes

227
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,839
seriously and i'm going out here

228
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:56,800
let's get into the classic rant against

229
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:59,120
sonic fanbase you know what they say

230
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,200
you either die a hero you're living long

231
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:05,440
enough to become the villain

232
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:08,560
okay that is it this is the final

233
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:11,279
straw i've had with all the

234
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,880
freaking trolls no you freaking haters

235
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:17,200

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,440
don't ruin sonic for everyone

238
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,360
you're the one that said sonic wasn't

239
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,480
appealing to the eye i didn't mean to

240
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:32,000
for it's not my fault with freaking

241
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:36,720
sonic team because you freaking threats

242
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,720
just can't be captured be quenched

243
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,920
your fantasies can't ever be quick okay

244
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,079
it's so good i love it so much when

245
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,000
you're faced on your final judgment

246
00:11:54,079 --> 00:12:00,720
basically the same script

247
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,560
when will he learn when will he learn

248
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,040
how does he go that high pitch i don't

249
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,120
know i think he's talking about all the

250
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,800
freaky fan art that comes out of sonic

251
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,240
there was like a meme at some point

252
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,760
people just making the most

253
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,519
despicable sonic fan art i mean i get it

254
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,600
i i'm fully 100

255
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,720
on sam's side here you've ruined the

256
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,959
sonic series

257
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,240
the side series is dead because of a

258
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,399
sonic fan base

259
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,519
i will forever hate the sonic fan

260
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:29,440
basically i'm dancing

261
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:33,040
for everything they do everything

262
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:39,839

263
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:39,839

264
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:47,680
[Applause]

265
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,480
this video led to a lot of attention to

266
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:53,760
sammy and people started uh

267
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,120
hating on him he got some trolls people

268
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,639
saying that

269
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:01,360
he's uh not actually 15. i'm over

270
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,920
five feet tall this is me when someone

271
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,639
tells

272
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:07,839

tall

274
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:14,720
but it seems that so over the years

275
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:17,200
sammy really he kind of calmed down

276
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:22,480
sonic the hedgehog

277
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:26,880

278
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:31,120

279
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:36,480
from idiots

280
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:39,199
to first of all what the freak

281
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,639
when the world needed him the most it

282
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:46,000

sammy has grown up and he returned and

287
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,160
it is an experience tell that i was

288
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,079

289
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,839
especially sonic mania i

290
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,279
was basically saying hey i have

291
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,959

292
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,440
