i do like the rainy thing it could be

376
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,959
nice if there was some splash of the

377
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,160
rain

378
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,240
you know you're kind of missing that

379
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,760
right technically it should hit here

380
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,480
here maybe it could be nice with some

381
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:22,160

480p 720p after marriage

390
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,040
yeah you dragged them down to your own

391
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,199
level

392
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,399
yeah that's how it's done right edgar

393
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,360
why do you look so

394
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:49,040
amazed by the scream what do you he

395
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,040
really likes the memes huh

396
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,120
he's really stuck on something isn't he

397
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,399
i cannot for the love of god remind

398
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,639
remember this tweet

399
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,600
but i have not seen any tweet more times

400
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,199
in this tweet

401
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,800
the alleged tweet is said to have been

402
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,920
posted on the eighth day of february

403
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,680
2017.

404
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,199
looking at way back machine snapshots of

405
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,600
pewdiepie's twitter timeline from the

406
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:09,279
12th of february 2017 we can see that

407
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,040
the alleged tweet does not exist

408
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,560
now one might argue that the tweet might

409
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,320
have been deleted soon after it was

410
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,160
posted and therefore was not archived in

411
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,600
the wayback machine snapshots well

412
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,040
digging further through the historical

413
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,800
snapshots we can establish that

414
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:23,040
pewdiepie only started using this duck

415
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,040
avatar in april of 2018 which is the

416
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,560
same avatar visible in the screenshot

417
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,399
this implies that the tweet must have

418
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,320
not been deleted until at least april of

419
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,639
2018 and should have been visible in the

420
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,440
snapshot from the 12th of february 2017

421
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,279
if it were real

422
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,959
whatever your fantasies may be it is

423
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:39,600
time for you to accept this reality and

424
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:42,800
to stop reposting this fake screenshot

425
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:45,199
so true i knew i wasn't crazy i knew i

426
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,120

because like you have this low-fi

467
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,600
music right it's a bit too intense

468
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,160
almost it needs to be

469
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,760
