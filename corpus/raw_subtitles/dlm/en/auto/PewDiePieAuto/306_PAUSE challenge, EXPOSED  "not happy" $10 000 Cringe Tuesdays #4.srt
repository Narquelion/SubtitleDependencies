00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,410
it's Tuesday my dudes

2
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:19,710
[Music]

3
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:27,699
and you know what that means

4
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:28,720
cringe to state time yeah Tuesday's is

5
00:00:27,699 --> 00:00:30,489
Tuesday

6
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,680
that's right everyone and today we're

7
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:34,750
looking at probably a video that a lot

8
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:37,120
of you have already seen I'm probably

9
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:39,280
one of the last commentary channels I

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:44,649
guess that's what I am to comment on

11
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:59,859
this but it's just too good to be true

12
00:00:44,649 --> 00:01:00,850
mogs pause video now morgs Canada Sapir

13
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:03,910
for a while I don't know if you're

14
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:06,460
familiar with this kid but he came back

15
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:12,210
he came back with his family and it's

16
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:12,210
just it's as weird outside all day

17
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:21,700
you don't have to do anything so the

18
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:24,010
gist of these videos is that you can

19
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:26,470
polish someone with a remote control at

20
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:29,410
any time now what the rules are beyond

21
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:31,570
that it's never explained who has to

22
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:33,760
controller how long do you get to use a

23
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:35,200
controller can you pause anyone at any

24
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,880
and all I need to know the rules

25
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,280
otherwise how the Frick you my supposed

26
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:47,110
to understand but all you need to know

27
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:48,880
is of course the mom really likes to

28
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:53,190
make that face and it makes me very very

29
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:56,979
very very very very uncomfortable

30
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:58,869
there's $10,000 on the line it's like

31
00:01:56,979 --> 00:02:00,850
the perfect example of youtube these

32
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:03,310
days you can't do anything well there's

33
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:12,160
not $10,000 on the line well why should

34
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:14,470
I care then huh why should I you can't

35
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:19,739
start a video without a giveaway first

36
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:22,269
this is 2019 god damn it we gotta do

37
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:32,320
yeah cuz liking doesn't do anything you

38
00:02:22,269 --> 00:02:34,660
just have to subscribe talking about

39
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,680
iPhones where is the iPhone I want one

40
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:41,000

he get the iPhone what is happening

43
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:55,129
that's why I liked most about these

44
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:56,659
videos this is super thick accent for

45
00:02:55,129 --> 00:02:58,730
some reason they're all just yelling

46
00:02:56,659 --> 00:03:00,349
constantly I don't understand him

47
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:16,639
everyone is his family's death

48
00:03:00,349 --> 00:03:18,889
apparently Shay she always does that

49
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:27,849
face and I don't like it I don't like it

50
00:03:18,889 --> 00:03:30,500

my videos I mean I guess this is

58
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,000
literally me in 2013 I can't really be

59
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:55,000

89
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:15,230

do the exact same thing you want to do

99
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:51,890
something annoying you always set it up

100
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,539
like oh yeah I should probably remove my

101
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:55,460
socks oh yeah we should probably shoot

102
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:57,080
this on the floor that's easy to clean

103
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:58,490

00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,280
guys I know this might come as a shock

105
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:04,490
this is fake all right if you point the

106
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:08,200
remote at someone and say it doesn't

107
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:08,200

00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:43,270

for those of you who don't know what

123
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,970
it's like if a girlfriend interrupts you

124
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:48,900
in a video game I had the exact same

125
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:51,420
reaction she went too far this is the

126
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:59,760
first time I've ever seen you on the

127
00:08:51,420 --> 00:09:05,310
treadmill okay I definitely did not need

128
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:10,130
to see that how is she being careful not

129
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:10,130

131
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:24,139
[Music]

132
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:33,580
oh this is so awkward

133
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:35,900
getting imagine filming this with my mom

134
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:49,100
just have your mom laying there on the

135
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:51,560
floor like how they went through all

136
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:53,270
this and then they thought hey Liss that

137
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:58,670
was awesome we replayed the clip three

138
00:09:53,270 --> 00:10:02,890
times but we should do to get she's

139
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:02,890
getting back on she's getting back on

140
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:16,340

146
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:52,740
Jesus Christ damn it don't say I didn't

147
00:10:51,870 --> 00:11:02,910

himself as well can you imagine being

151
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:16,740
neighbors to this family I guess

152
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:26,480
actually it's probably not worse than

153
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:26,480
being a bag of ice jokes over me

154
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:39,060
I think I am too pushy yeah oh my god

155
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:42,060
it's not like you could have done that

156
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:44,420
anyway why do I care it doesn't matter

157
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,420
it's

158
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:52,259
[Music]

159
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:54,749
he got destroyed that's some pause

160
00:11:52,259 --> 00:11:57,269
action right there that's what you get

161
00:11:54,749 --> 00:12:03,059
for killing him in fortnight these

162
00:11:57,269 --> 00:12:04,589
girlfriends got to learn like how now

163
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:06,629
after they've done the groceries they

164
00:12:04,589 --> 00:12:08,309
had their food they come back and they

165
00:12:06,629 --> 00:12:10,259
thought to themself in the car hey

166
00:12:08,309 --> 00:12:13,350
wouldn't be epic if we like pause in the

167
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:16,499
car since you humiliated me in the shop

168
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:25,169
Morgan no Morgan no don't do this mold

169
00:12:16,499 --> 00:12:31,919
and it's crazy no Morgan we're in the

170
00:12:25,169 --> 00:12:35,669
car oh my god Morgan you can't do that

171
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:37,470
if she dies we die because we are in the

172
00:12:35,669 --> 00:12:40,739
car we're all sitting in this car

173
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:41,819
together so if she crashes then we all

174
00:12:40,739 --> 00:12:46,559
crash

175
00:12:41,819 --> 00:12:49,410
I think Morgan you can't do that I bet

176
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:51,660
you weren't expecting male ones on your

177
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:53,999
these are the stinkiest bugs I can find

178
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:56,069

179
00:12:53,999 --> 00:12:58,019
eaten those they're not that bad

00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:08,459
Thanks gross okay this is nothing shake

185
00:13:06,509 --> 00:13:13,349
my head you call this a pause challenge

186
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:14,279
know what miss buck and also it's no one

187
00:13:13,349 --> 00:13:16,259
gonna point out there they're not

188
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:17,699
actually pressing the pause button

189
00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:20,009
they're just pressing the off button

190
00:13:17,699 --> 00:13:23,129
okay see that's not the pause button

191
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:25,619
alright so I think that finally confirms

192
00:13:23,129 --> 00:13:28,259
that the pause challenge is actually in

193
00:13:25,619 --> 00:13:29,939

00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:31,949

all day until the hair turns off the

209
00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:38,950
only way you can stop me is by giving up

210
00:14:37,619 --> 00:15:01,330

211
00:14:38,950 --> 00:15:04,630

220
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:35,440
weird seeing a whole family do this at

221
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:37,510
the same time it's clearly just like a

222
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,980
kids show at this point it's surreal to

223
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:41,320
me seeing how these things are still

224
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:43,840
