articles like BuzzFeed every day without

citing a source promote channels that do

28
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,740

00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:59,040
that she's been on the trending page two

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,170

careful there buddy you're showing a bit

56
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,890
too much information

00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:45,870

00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:50,489
great thank you

60
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:52,430
careful not to show too much just put

61
00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:54,959
the contract out there they're crazy

62
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:56,910
2018 oh my god there's so much

63
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,280
information we didn't know if he wanted

64
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:01,380
more monthly salary we sent him a deal

65
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,880
that was gonna pay him seven figures a

66
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,380
year why do they always do that they

67
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,269
always take seven figures it's in 1

68
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:08,340
million whenever someone says seven

69
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:10,590
figures that means a million it doesn't

70
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,390
mean anything else seven figure oh a

71
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:15,329
million so they address the allegations

72
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:17,400
that face is taking money out of the

73
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:19,920
code T few stuff which apparently is a

74
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,870
lot of money into the Fortnight purchase

75
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,549
code thingamajigger we've seen a little

76
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:25,739
miscommunication in terms of community

77
00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:27,150
understanding about in-game items and

78
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:29,220
what that might mean and what that apply

79
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,600
to let us be very on the record right

80
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:32,549
now that has nothing to do with support

81
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,859
of creator coach T P was signed in April

82
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:37,950
of 2018 while epic announcement

83
00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:40,079
supporter created in October of 2018 so

84
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:42,060
they're basically saying it was

85
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:43,920
impossible for us to take money out of

86
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,389
it because you know they would have had

87
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,130
it in their deal if this contract

88
00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:49,739
happened after they announced this

89
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:51,120
support a creator program you know you

90
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:52,230
know damn well they would put something

91
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,920
in there but they're saying that they

92
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,790
wouldn't do that

93
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,650
I

94
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:57,629
I kind of doubt on that when it became

95
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:00,390
clear to us that his Puran I've never

96
00:03:57,629 --> 00:04:02,430
seen more private texts in my entire

97
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:04,500
life than these past three weeks every

98
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,819
one is just aa private text I will put

99
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,400
that in a video when it became clear to

100
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:10,980
us that his pure intention was really

101
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:14,129
just to leave that's very difficult

102
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:16,019
so they address the criticism that face

103
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:17,639
been getting because T P obviously wants

104
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:21,239
out of this contract why can't you just

105
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:23,729
let them him and they say this oh why

106
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:25,860
didn't you just let him out we are fans

107
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:27,840
much more of a debt than that because

108
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,310
our fans have invested their time and

109
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,139
their effort and their care and their

110
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:33,750
love into the relationship that we

111
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:36,090
created with T foo to kind of argument

112
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:38,370
is that it's for the fans guys they're

113
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:40,320
just looking out for the fans so they

114
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:42,210
want to preserve this relationship that

115
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,449
they have between the fans and face

116
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:47,789
Klein and Teague but Teague clearly

117
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:48,990
wants nothing to do with favs claim so

118
00:04:47,789 --> 00:04:51,720
what kind of relationship are you

119
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:53,520
preserving there am I am I am I cavemen

120
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,099
dummy dumb I don't get it what's the

121
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,530
argument and for us to just drop him

122
00:04:56,099 --> 00:05:00,479
solely because he wanted out I don't

123
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:02,070
think anybody can rationally claimed it

124
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:05,010
that would have sat well with our fan

125
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:06,810
base or frankly the culture of hit

126
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:09,000
gaming and relationships in general if

127
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:11,789
we were to just drop him the culture and

128
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,979
the relationship of gaming in general if

129
00:05:11,789 --> 00:05:16,110
they drop him would be hurt what the

130
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:18,000
[ __ ] are you talking about that culture

131
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:19,680
is ruined because you didn't want to let

132
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,479
him out TV who said that I want to make

133
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,800
it clear that I tried multiple times for

134
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:24,479
multiple months to get out of this

135
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,370
contract no one was blindsided by

136
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,849
there's no one this relationship is

137
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:32,760
publicly broken how do you apply this

138
00:05:29,849 --> 00:05:35,340
argument it doesn't make any sense I get

139
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,990
it from a business standpoint and I

140
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:39,389
totally get that they want to

141
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:41,400
renegotiate with TV you to keep him

142
00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:43,169
signed that's obviously better for face

143
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,669
and they I understand that they built

144
00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:46,770
this relationship that they need to keep

145
00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:48,229
intact the contract actually did leak

146
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:50,729
and I showed it in my life's video

147
00:05:48,229 --> 00:05:51,900
because Brad put it in but I hadn't

148
00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:53,550
actually seen it so I didn't get a

149
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:56,159
chance to react to it because it

150
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:59,520
happened as the video went up and the

151
00:05:56,159 --> 00:06:01,259
split was between phase and Tipu 80% in

152
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,320
favor of phase plan between brand deals

153
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:06,599
and then brand deals brought in by by T

154
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,110
few so he wasn't exclusive but if he

155
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:10,320
brings in the

156
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:14,580
randal he still has to pay them 50%

157
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:16,020
okay appearance fees 50% okay well I'm

158
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:19,320
just not gonna do any tournaments or

159
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:23,940
like public places then and tournaments

160
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:25,710
they take 20% damn what a great deal wow

161
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,880
I don't understand what if you want to

162
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:28,890
get out of this contract

163
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:32,010
now the cherry on the cake here is that

164
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:32,820
if he wants to leave or it gets out of

165
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:34,980
the contract

166
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:38,280
gamers shall be prohibited from playing

167
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:40,890
video games publicly online or in live

168
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:43,110
tournaments or professionally for a

169
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:44,790
period of six months I don't understand

170
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:46,050
why T few wants out of this contract it

171
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:50,280
makes no sense at all

172
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:52,470
what the Frick a lot of Frick's I don't

173
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:54,630
get it at the end of the day t for you

174
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:57,060
is a dummy dumb dumb for signing this

175
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:59,010
contract and face Klein is a dummy dumb

176
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,990
dumb for having this contract to begin

177
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:02,160
with it's a weird situation where I can

178
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:04,890
understand both sides

179
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,780
I understand T few from not wanting to

180
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:07,620
renegotiate when you're already in a bad

181
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:10,170
situation

182
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:13,200
but it also sounds like face gave good

183
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:15,060
deals to T few and good as a way to

184
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,370
compromise from this situation I think

185
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:20,280
it is interesting that T few spoke up

186
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:22,170
I'm curious if other people will as well

187
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,910
other people maybe are stuck in these

188
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:25,230
similar contract cuz otherwise I don't

189
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,970
think we'll hear anything about this

190
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:29,340
anymore because now both parties that

191
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:31,470
kind of said there's until there's some

192
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:33,750
legal development and whatever that's

193
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:36,270
gonna be it's gonna be hit hard I think

194
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:39,120
unless they settle outside a court T few

195
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:41,520
has now changed his fades Klan logo

196
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,970
threw spongebob Squidward

197
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:48,270
that's not squid or that's Patrick idiot

198
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:50,880
next news rest in peace social blade

199
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:52,530
YouTube just famous social blade

200
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,410
everyone YouTube announced that they're

201
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:57,150
changing the site to round out the

202
00:07:54,410 --> 00:08:00,270
subscriber numbers it will no longer

203
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:02,610
show the specific number of each

204
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:04,830
subscriber it will round it up currently

205
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:06,300
all craters with over thousand

206
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:07,320
subscribers get their subscriber cone

207
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,600
displayed differently in different

208
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:13,050
places on YouTube and for the sake of

209
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:14,790
consistency they are changing this so

210
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:17,070
YouTube for example on their channel

211
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:20,050
says 15 point blah blah blah

212
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:21,849
it will now just say 7.20

213
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:24,009
instead of four thousand three hundred

214
00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:25,750
four point three and depending on how

215
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:27,729
high subscriber count you have or how

216
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:29,440
low subscriber count it will round it

217
00:08:27,729 --> 00:08:31,720
out differently so if you have low

218
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,580
subscribers it will it won't just show

219
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,649
nothing or whatever and this goes up

220
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:37,930
until a thousand and I think that's a

221
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:39,940
reasonable number at least to round it

222
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:41,800
off off but people were very unhappy

223
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:44,140
with this saying this is just annoying

224
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:47,140
I'd rather see the number go physically

225
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:49,120
up lul nobody once states I have a great

226
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:52,089
idea youtube listen to your creators

227
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,339
this also means the end of these flare

228
00:08:52,089 --> 00:08:56,560
TV like live streams with the subscriber

229
00:08:54,339 --> 00:08:58,029
counts going up and down because that

230
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,769
will no longer function then YouTube

231
00:08:58,029 --> 00:09:02,140
will no longer give that information and

232
00:08:59,769 --> 00:09:03,370
that was confirmed on Twitter as well I

233
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:05,200
think there's a couple things to note

234
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:07,089
here when YouTube said consistency I

235
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,610
thought they meant initially like other

236
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:13,300
websites have consistently like that

237
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:15,820
like Twitter shows the same way they

238
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:17,620
round up there's the numbers and same

239
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:20,890
with Instagram they round up the numbers

240
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:23,019
so I thought our consistency across the

241
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:24,459
internet but it no its consistency

242
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:26,649
across their website but I think most

243
00:09:24,459 --> 00:09:29,170
people understand that this isn't just

244
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:31,779
because of that it's also to end these

245
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:33,610
sort of live subscriber count' drama

246
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:35,260
battle dwarfs or whatever you want to

247
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:38,740
call it we just clearly become a

248
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:42,270
phenomenon that's a word and of itself

249
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:45,310
that maybe I had a little bit part of

250
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:47,290
having something to do with maybe just a

251
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:49,510
little I think especially after this

252
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:51,279
Tati versus James situation where James

253
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:53,170
Trotter literally lost millions of

254
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,000
subscribers largely due to these live

255
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:57,970
streams that went on die showed the

256
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,010
subscriber camp it got it so popular and

257
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:01,899
and then I mean at the end of the day

258
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:03,730
James Charles pretty much came out on

259
00:10:01,899 --> 00:10:05,589
top but he still lost so many

260
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:08,800
subscribers from it which I don't think

261
00:10:05,589 --> 00:10:11,560
he has recuperated yet so it's

262
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,390
interesting regardless what YouTube

263
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,190
decided to do by this and and I don't

264
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:17,290
know it's rich for me to talk about this

265
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:19,870
because obviously I benefited from this

266
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:22,089
but I don't see this is that bad of a

267
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:25,480
thing I think in general people are

268
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:26,980
misplaced with YouTube and they want a

269
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,110
positive change I think YouTube

270
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:31,630
desperately needs a positive change for

271
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:32,950
the website something that people will

272
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:35,680
go wow that's some cool

273
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:37,149
I like that because right now it makes

274
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,779
it impossible for you to to announce

275
00:10:37,149 --> 00:10:44,310
anything that isn't positive like fixing

276
00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:47,110
the sub count system gaining fixing the

277
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:48,970
fixing this copyright system

278
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:51,339
nobody YouTube's changing something that

279
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:55,510
no one wanted basically brah

280
00:10:51,339 --> 00:10:57,399
next news what forty thousand videos

281
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:59,019
tell us about the trending time this

282
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:02,470
YouTube recalled coffee break made a

283
00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:04,029
video exposing the trending tab I'm

284
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:06,910
trying to understand what does YouTube

285
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:08,889
want from from us aspirated a clip from

286
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:10,779
the show the view that has 10,000 views

287
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:11,920
is not trending but it's number three

288
00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:13,779
trend that's when you start to think oh

289
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:18,070
this is real I want to show you a clip

290
00:11:13,779 --> 00:11:20,170
from the trending tab and as you can see

291
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:22,389
all of the videos don't seem to be made

292
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:26,220
by Creative bra now YouTube has

293
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:28,990
responded on this already Susan in her

294
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:29,500
promises for 2019 I don't know if that's

295
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:31,899
what it's called

296
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:34,600
I did say that at least half the videos

297
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:36,610
in trending will come from youtubers so

298
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,740
they are already implementing changes

299
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:40,990
for the training tab to benefit creators

300
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:43,149
which they've been largely criticized

301
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:45,070
for but I think what this video really

302
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:48,149
showed really well in this study that

303
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:51,070
coffee break did it's just visualizing

304
00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:53,470
how it is right now so basically they

305
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:55,570
took data from 40,000 videos but data

306
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:56,649
40,000 entries a lot of my reason for

307
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:58,690
doing this is I want to answer the

308
00:11:56,649 --> 00:12:01,060
age-old question is YouTube biased

309
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:04,420
towards traditional media I mean yes I

310
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:06,790
think generally youtubers has been seen

311
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:10,240
as something unsafe you know you can't

312
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:12,190
rest assured that every youtuber isn't

313
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,320
gonna be consistent with what they put

314
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:16,690
out there in terms of sparking

315
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,670
controversy and I think maybe I am a

316
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:21,160
testimony to that and generally

317
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:22,720
traditional media is a lot more safe

318
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,519
than that and that's why they're biased

319
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,730
towards it I mean I think that's

320
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:29,079
basically it but regardless them getting

321
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:31,540
on training how many views they needed

322
00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:33,459
to get on trending and then we have so

323
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:36,339
the way the graph works is that it shows

324
00:12:33,459 --> 00:12:38,889
average views before trending and number

325
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:41,500
of training videos Lele pons she seems

326
00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:43,449
to have trended about ten times on the

327
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,970
training tab and she it took her about

328
00:12:43,449 --> 00:12:46,690
four million views on average to get on

329
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:49,090
trending go

330
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:51,940
10 times ok so that's how to read this

331
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:54,750
so what do we find who do we find with a

332
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:58,060
lot of times on trending the answer is

333
00:12:54,750 --> 00:13:01,960
overwhelmingly traditional media

334
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:03,670
traditional media as in ESPN as you can

335
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:07,380
show Jimmy Fallon Jimmy Kimmel Stephen

336
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:11,100
Colbert Netflix MBA a CNN box brunt

337
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:13,410
almost all late-night or like

338
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:16,780
traditional meat like the most

339
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:19,360
mainstream of mainstream media is who we

340
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:20,500
see over represented on trending over

341
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,680
and over and over again

342
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:25,810
and I want to stress this is not due to

343
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,790
the fact they're getting more views than

344
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:30,010
these other youtubers right because then

345
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:32,530
they would be up here for example if

346
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:35,830
Logan Paul's barrier to trending is

347
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:37,930
about 11 million views then no matter

348
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:40,000
how much he uploads he's a lot less

349
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:41,890
likely to trend frequently didn't

350
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,180
someone like ESPN who's barrier to

351
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:46,720
trending is on average about five

352
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:48,460
hundred thousand views eighty four brah

353
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,620
you know I always thought of the

354
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:52,600
threshold theory of like okay well could

355
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:55,450
Logan Paul gets consistently high of you

356
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:57,160
so you shouldn't need that much he would

357
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:59,860
have to actually get a lot higher abuse

358
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,820
to trend but eighty four something else

359
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:03,790
caught my eye

360
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:05,740
PewDiePie I know that guy his training

361
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:08,590
data is super interesting because he

362
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:10,840
trends all over the world yet he barely

363
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:12,250
trends in the US now here's where I tell

364
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,960
you that we don't just have the US data

365
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:17,230
set we have all these other countries

366
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:18,730
too and when you look at those countries

367
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:22,530
PewDiePie is crushing it everywhere

368
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:25,330
except the us even in non-english

369
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:27,190
algorithm it's bizarre though you got

370
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:28,750
now YouTube is mentioned for some time

371
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:31,860
that they have human moderators perhaps

372
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:36,610
he gets blocked most of the time perhaps

373
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:38,020
maybe but how do you test that I decided

374
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:41,080
to look at other controversial creators

375
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:42,940
too I don't think you need to test it he

376
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:45,070
then compares the stats with Canada

377
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:46,630
because it's similar this is because

378
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:48,160
Canada is operating in the same time

379
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:49,630
zones they have similar cultural

380
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,430
interests and they also speak English

381
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:53,170
now all of these controversial creators

382
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:55,089
are extremely popular and have some

383
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:57,339
level of swearing or edginess to them

384
00:14:55,089 --> 00:14:58,990
and this is what I found on the US side

385
00:14:57,339 --> 00:15:00,070
many of these creators aren't trending

386
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:01,840
at all or if they

387
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:03,970
are trending it's once or twice and

388
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:11,410
that's it for comparison here's the

389
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:15,400
Canadian side Oh 45 that means 45 times

390
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:16,060
someone at YouTube went PewDiePie get

391
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,890
him out of here

392
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:22,030
PewDiePie get him out of here PewDiePie

393
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:24,130
get get him out of here oh my god that's

394
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:26,170
amazing what else do we got the only

395
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:29,020
thing that makes up for it is maybe the

396
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:33,490
idea that America had moderation at this

397
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:35,410
point and maybe just maybe now he points

398
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:37,030
out the hypocrisy of the fact that a lot

399
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:39,400
of traditional media is actually very

400
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:42,010
edgy I moved on her like a venom cook

401
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:43,690
but I couldn't get there that's clearly

402
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:46,150
not what it's about it's not about

403
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:50,530
edginess is what YouTube deems save

404
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:54,280
content at least I haven't tested that

405
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:56,440
theory but I wonder how 44 of my videos

406
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:58,630
like what were those videos that were

407
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:01,540
deemed unsafe if that was the case

408
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:04,900
rename it sponsor tab there problem

409
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:07,690
solved just delete the trending tab

410
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:09,490
please I'm sick of hearing about it

411
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:11,340
what's the point it's just making people

412
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:14,860
pissed off like either make it

413
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:17,800
completely fair then again they they

414
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:19,960
have to the thing is if YouTube doesn't

415
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:22,570
censor the training tab there will be

416
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:24,400
articles written about how YouTube is

417
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:27,610
showing on this front page of YouTube

418
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:31,000
these bad content you know this is more

419
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:33,040
media attacks coming to YouTube if that

420
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,420
was the case how long is this video I

421
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,220
didn't realize it's gonna be this

422
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:39,190
goddamn long I have so much more to

423
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:42,100
cover here on PO news keep watching but

424
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:44,920
we have one more news I'm sorry whoever

425
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:49,240
has to edit this video it's God awfully

426
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:51,040
long but chaos I just got cancelled and

427
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,810
I need to put that in the title because

428
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,960
that's gonna bring more people in they

429
00:16:52,810 --> 00:17:00,400
GK's eyes brother six minute video

430
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:02,380
called by where he calls out ksi his own

431
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,480
brother so apparently this is a concept

432
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:06,850
now where someone exposes someone that

433
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:10,240
they are close to in a 40-plus minute

434
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:12,250
video showing a private texts and making

435
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,280
the other person lose subscribers I mean

436
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,410
ksi is losing

437
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,510
subscribers now now they GE frame says

438
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:19,910
he he doesn't want this to happen and

439
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:21,770
he's just trying to stand up for himself

440
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:24,200
apparently a lot of people see him as

441
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:26,900
the bad guy and this is him showing I'm

442
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:29,870
not actually the bad guy and I don't

443
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:31,430
even try and follow the dead Guk side

444
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:33,230
drama that's been going on with all the

445
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:34,730
disk tracks and bla bla bla I never seen

446
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:36,290
dad yes the bad guy so I'm not sure

447
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:39,110
exactly who he's addressing here

448
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:40,640
probably ksi fanboys which mine probably

449
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:43,670
won't be changed regardless of this

450
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:47,900
video also let's not forget about the

451
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:50,030
dark place they made a new O's in a dark

452
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:54,200
place it just put me in a dark place

453
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:55,520
dark place in a very very dark place why

454
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,140
do all these people go to the range

455
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,030
without my permission

456
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:00,650
it's old video to me just seems like a

457
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:03,050
little brother not being feeling

458
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:06,680
recognized by his brother I couldn't

459
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:09,070
explain cuz I have done nothing but

460
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:11,750
support my brother

461
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:12,500
everything I've supported him with his

462
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:15,020
music

463
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:17,270
JD addresses a lot of the drama that's

464
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:19,070
been gone on between them behind the

465
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:21,320
scenes of the diss track talking about

466
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:23,870
how he was actually hurt by a lot of

467
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:25,280
things that went down and talking about

468
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:27,260
the drama that happened between

469
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,790
Christmas apparently there was something

470
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:30,980
that happened and he wasn't actually the

471
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:32,960
bad guy I cannot be bothered to get into

472
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:35,450
it I am don't care about the research I

473
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,650
give up okay it seems to me like haze I

474
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:38,990
maybe isn't the most compassionate

475
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:41,540
brother and a lot of history haver he's

476
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:44,450
kind of put towards Isis Panther and

477
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:47,570
they G maybe is a little more sensitive

478
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:50,660
than your average person it's just the

479
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:52,580
bits of banter please digi this is just

480
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:55,130
blunt but it also seems like a lot of

481
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:57,320
stuff went too far between them but here

482
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:59,870
we are private stuff in the public eye

483
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:01,640
very fun very interesting now it did

484
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:03,560
seem like this video actually swayed a

485
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,150
lot of people's opinion I used to

486
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,650
dislike you watching this video is

487
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:08,150
relatable I misjudged you without

488
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:09,680
knowing your backstory I wish you the

489
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:11,630
best day Jean it sort of became

490
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:14,090
overwhelming support for JD in this

491
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:16,430
video I guess now we can expect a 45

492
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:18,170
minute video from ksi addressing this

493
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:19,950
whole thing and another more back and

494
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:21,930
forth with private matter

495
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:23,730
that I don't even know I also feel like

496
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:25,800
this whole thing they already have a lot

497
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:28,170
of drama in the public eye so I can't

498
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:30,440
really be too critical about this whole

499
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:33,540
concept but it's just like god damn it's

500
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:35,880
another one it hasn't even been a week

501
