their allowance because he wasn't happy

20
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:02,489
with the amount his mom walked out of

21
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:04,769
her room and saw this what would you do

22
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:12,299
if this was your child Gabe you send

23
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:15,060

138
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,819
give content today when you went to

139
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:00,620
adult websites you didn't really

140
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:03,080
understand how the parents knew that you

141
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:06,229
went to the website at least I just knew

142
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:08,599
that my dad could figure it out huh but

143
00:08:06,229 --> 00:08:11,330
I didn't know how so I thought okay if I

144
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:13,250
go I need to make the motor side of this

145
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:15,830
so how can I make you know I crossed

146
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:17,900
this border how do I make the most out

147
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:21,680
of it and he just just went in all the

148
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:25,370
way no I I decided hey I'm gonna print

149
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:29,029
out I'm gonna print out all these

150
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:30,319
pictures right you're right have I not

151
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:32,270
told you this I don't think you have

152
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,430
either you ever I forgot about well we

153
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:37,579
had a really fancy printer that was like

154
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:43,610
in the cub or and it was a Wi-Fi printer

155
00:08:37,579 --> 00:08:45,910
so it it it as I was printing I realized

156
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:50,149
no god what have I done this is terrible

157
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:53,360
so I canceled all the prints and then a

158
00:08:50,149 --> 00:08:56,230
few days later my dad comes in with a

159
00:08:53,360 --> 00:09:00,020
bunch of printed on pictures

160
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:06,079
yeah and he told me wow you like girls

161
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:09,850
with big titties and I just grabbed the

162
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:09,850
pictures and I locked myself in the room

163
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:24,830
finally dad Thanks I've been waiting for

164
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:29,210
these - see this is the a prime example

165
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:33,470
of kick not all kids okay clearly I was

166
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:35,750
an innovator I was taking that extra

167
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:38,750
step you know what maybe I need to go to

168
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:40,650
range maybe that's why I turned out this

169
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:42,520
way because I never went to the ranch I

170
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:46,010
[Music]

171
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:48,650
would say that I've never heard of you

172
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:50,990
might willingly go to the ranch before I

173
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:53,540
realize it's time you know that's what

174
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:57,920
childhoods go to die right yeah that's

175
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:59,690
where I go to die now tea services

176
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,480
probably passed me anyway I might as

177
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:07,490
well thank you Ken this has been very

178
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:10,400

179
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:13,220

180
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,780
ranch man don't go don't go I'm going

181
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:18,550
