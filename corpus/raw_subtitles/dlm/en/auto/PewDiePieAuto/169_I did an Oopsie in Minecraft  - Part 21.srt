191
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:57,420

staying whole spent you come with me so

206
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:39,820
I have something to admit okay I've made

207
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:46,270
an oopsie I basically added I cheated

208
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:47,530
okay I cheated I'm sorry I feel what

209
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:49,900
does it feel like I've done something

210
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:52,270
awful when I was memeing with the pigs

211
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:53,770
I changed the game mode so I can't get

212
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:57,130
more potatoes how do you think it was a

213
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:59,230
big deal I think it probably isn't a big

214
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:00,550
deal for a lot of people but since some

215
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:02,380
people were bothered by it and I can

216
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:04,420
kind of understand the whole like okay

217
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:06,610
well if you cheat on this thing did he

218
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:09,100
actually built the meatballs yes I built

219
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:10,330
the meatball stop saying that

220
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,740
even though most people don't care and

221
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:14,440
they're like I just have fun playing the

222
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:17,950
game I want to stick I want to stay true

223
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:19,840
to - what the - what the series is so I

224
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:23,110
promise I pray this is a PewDiePie

225
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:26,740
promise I will not never not on my spare

226
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:28,780
time not another thing use it okay just

227
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:31,600
so we're clear I prom I promise I

228
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:34,090
thought today that I was gonna build a

229
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,980
memorial for year again and show me

230
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:38,560
actually building it so you will

231
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:40,720
actually believe me that I built this

232
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,360
thing okay so I know most people don't

233
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,940
care about that the whole creative mode

234
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,260
thing but I really care about this

235
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:49,540
playthrough and I know a lot of people

236
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:51,190
do as well so and I feel like it only

237
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:53,770
makes sense for me to build this for

238
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:56,530
uragan and do it the right way

239
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:58,750
I'm gonna need some spruce Panks but

240
00:13:56,530 --> 00:14:01,560
it's gonna be worth it cuz Jurgen was a

241
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,560
spruce II guy

242
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:09,879

243
00:14:07,129 --> 00:14:13,879
what do you guys think hey there's men

244
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:15,859

245
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:19,339

246
00:14:15,859 --> 00:14:20,689
I'm gonna need to make Spain I'm gonna

247
00:14:19,339 --> 00:14:22,849

[Music]

274
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:05,880
dinosaur but I don't think he's working

275
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:07,170
