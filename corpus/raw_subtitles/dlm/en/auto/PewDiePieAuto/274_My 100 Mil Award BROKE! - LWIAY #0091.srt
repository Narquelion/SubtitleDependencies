1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,440
stop I just wanted to interrupt this

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,150
video because I need to make an

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,340
announcement did you guys see the video

4
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:10,139
I made where I celebrated a hundred

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,820
million subscribers it was the video I

6
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:14,849
was really excited about I talked about

7
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,859
my journey from going to zero to one

8
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:18,900
hundred million subscribers it did have

9
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,359
a brand attachment to it which maybe

10
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,430
wasn't the most fitting place but it was

11
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,990
a cool product so I thought it wouldn't

12
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,000
matter when we were planning the

13
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,070
collaboration we thought it would be

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,439
nice to donate to a charity as a way to

15
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,840
celebrate I made the mistake of picking

16
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,210
a charity that I was adviced instead of

17
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,629
picking a charity that I'm personally

18
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,980
passionate about which is 100% my fault

19
00:00:38,629 --> 00:00:43,440
usually when I pick a charity I take my

20
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,780
time I find a charity that I'm really

21
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,059
excited about and actually passionate to

22
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,690
donate to so when I uploaded the video

23
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:53,640
talking about the charity it was very

24
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:56,070
brief and people could tell something

25
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,690
was off the whole internet just didn't

26
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:00,120
believe in like why is he donating to

27
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:03,809
this charity look at his face full of

28
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:06,600
conspiracy mode and it was very

29
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:08,760
interesting to watch that unfold to be

30
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,320
fair I saw it as an opportunity to put

31
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,299
an end to these all trite claims that

32
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,490
has been thrown against me it wasn't to

33
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:16,950
try and clear my name or save grace if

34
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:19,979
it was I would have done a years ago but

35
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:22,290
after the Christchurch tragedy I felt a

36
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:24,390
responsibility to do something about it

37
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,759
because it's no longer just about me

38
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:29,340
it affected other people in a way and

39
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,560
I'm not okay with that I've struggled to

40
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,119
figure out how to do that but this was

41
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,400
not the right way to go about it

42
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,020
I knew it wasn't perfect but I also

43
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,680
didn't know a lot of things that

44
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,939
surfaced

45
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,700
throughout this whole thing about the

46
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:43,619
charity that doesn't fit at all so I

47
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,270
understand why people had concerns about

48
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:47,399
it and these are things that I would

49
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:49,229
have known myself I had just taken my

50
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:52,579
time this whole thing was planned during

51
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:54,869
my wedding and the honeymoon and

52
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:57,360
100,000,000 was coming up as well so it

53
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:58,890
was all very rushed it really doesn't

54
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,950
feel genuine for me to proceed with a

55
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:04,590
donation at this point and I instead

56
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:06,899
wanted to actually do take my time keep

57
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,250
the intent that I had but just doing it

58
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:10,710
with the right charity

59
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,360
and doing it properly I just wanted to

60
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:14,310
make that clear I'm sorry for all the

61
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,670
confusion and I'm sorry for messing this

62
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:20,390
up that's what I do

63
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:20,390

137
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:18,720
theories in late 2022 hmm bro tickle the

138
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,099
fattest bro tickle will come if we met

139
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,849
I'm kidding I'm not playing into that

140
00:06:20,099 --> 00:06:25,889
anymore but the fattest bro tickle

141
00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:27,770
Maya's old now she doesn't want the same

142
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:30,990
food anymore

143
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:33,570
why is that sad she says old and sassy

144
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:35,130
she's like nah I'm not having it

145
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:38,540
screw you you've been feeding me the

146
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:40,770
same food every single day for years I

147
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:41,160
mean it's kind of understandable isn't

148
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,720
it

149
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,480
you wouldn't like eating the same food

150
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,470
every day you had to get however no

151
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,080
problem

152
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:51,540
I feel like Maya is more of a person

153
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,580
than than a dog sometimes cuz she she

154
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:55,380
always communicates stuff to us like if

155
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,830
she wants to go out she'll go to the

156
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:58,800
door

157
00:06:55,830 --> 00:07:01,470
if she wants food she'll start petting

158
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,230
the bowl if she wants cuddles

159
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:04,590
she starts patting my face wait what is

160
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:07,230
this

161
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:10,860
you know how pewds goes like Bing bong

162
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:14,280
Bing Bing bong well I know what it means

163
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:18,840
Oh God if Bing it's one and bong is zero

164
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:22,650
it would be one zero one one zero in the

165
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:26,760
binary number system that is equal to 22

166
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:29,700
in normal numbers 22 in letters is BB if

167
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:34,640
you pronounce BB it sounds like Bab a I

168
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:34,640
think Felix is secretly telling us that

169
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:44,730
you figured me out at Hertz dude put all

170
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:49,140

better at redstone if you're like

252
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,910
registered is one of those things that

253
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:27,530
looks complicated if someone else

254
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:30,890
explains it but when you do it yourself

255
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:32,240
it's so easy and basic I like I always

256
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,860
feel really dumb when I watch all the

257
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,350
people but then you put the stuff in as

258
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:38,600
