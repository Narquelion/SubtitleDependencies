99
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:18,890
butt other guys trying to interact and

100
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:22,100

101
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:24,410
up over something finally thank you it's

102
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:27,530
been so passing this whole time I mean I

103
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:29,720
can't hold her as a slave and keep her

104
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:31,130
in my basement but if there's you know

105
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,750
guys saying like hey let's go out to

106
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:34,790

107
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:36,170

108
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:41,720
then she's getting sent back to Russia

109
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:43,310

110
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,620
times where men are gonna try out gates

111
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:48,500
I guess it's where like you know the

112
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:50,150
love and the trust you know really has

113
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,100
to play a big part it's good that they

114
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:53,750
have that foundation at least it's good

115
00:05:52,100 --> 00:06:09,710
that they have love and trust to go on

116
00:05:53,750 --> 00:06:12,860
because they owe George King the

117
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:16,240
jell-o's we do like we do with

129
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:04,710
sister isn't

130
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:10,770
yeah well that one I know I know I'm 1

131
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:13,110
atm quick all right I can feel that they

132
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:16,140
don't really like what you have so many

133
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:24,600
likable quality George but that was just

134
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:28,230
some sit down who tells their sister

135
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:30,420
about their problem what the hell oh my

136
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:33,980
god I was thinking a lot about their

137
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:37,800
origin Jorge it's like yeah obviously

138
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:40,290
what she does that's on her 100% right

139
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:43,230
but he's also allowing her behavior to

140
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:45,150
happen you know if unless you put your

141
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:47,040
foot down in a relationship and say no

142
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:49,410
I'm not gonna tolerate this or you went

143
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:51,270
too far it's just gonna keep going and

144
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:53,730
going and going and she's just going as

145
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:55,980
far as she can at every time so he is

146
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:59,100
technically allowing her behavior to

147
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:00,750
happen by just lighting its lime you

148
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:02,790

223
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:55,269
