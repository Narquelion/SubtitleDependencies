1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:07,649
do all gamers think the same well today

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:09,510
we find out when they just said the

3
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:10,530
phrase it's just a game it's such a weak

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:14,219
mindset

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:16,590
I also fully free Jubilee uploaded this

6
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:18,330
video do all gamers think the same the

7
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,400
premise is that you have a bunch of

8
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,380
gamers and they go to the left or to the

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,050
right depending on how much they agree

10
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:28,830
on an issue regarding to gaming I'm a

11
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:32,820
gamer so let's freakin do this

12
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:35,250
I don't think gaming is anti-women

13
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,050
like no guy is saying oh you can't play

14
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,399
online today because you're a woman I

15
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:41,760
don't think it's anti that's because

16
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:45,800
she's never played with me it's a joke

17
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:48,960
but I think there's just a lot more Sam

18
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:52,770
Sam you don't understand you have it

19
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,930
really bad all right I'm joking by the

20
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,469
way these are not my real opinions I am

21
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,469
just making jokes

22
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:03,410
spectrum that's what all gamers are on

23
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:05,690
get it that's one thing gamers have in

24
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:09,980
common as a joke another joke why do I

25
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:11,540
keep making them I'm Ariana Gamboa I'm

26
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:14,360
19 years old and I play Halo

27
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:17,000

runescape and overwatch nice well done

31
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:29,060
Jubilee are you really sure

32
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:30,890
oh god one misconception is how much

33
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:34,580
work people actually put in there's a

34
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:36,320
lot that goes into it a lot of people

35
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:38,060
you know how to negative stigmas playing

36
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,560
games do nothing with his life rather it

37
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,820
can be a quite a healthy outlet and

38
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,000
people really build in the future stop

39
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:48,020
again don't do that don't point at me

40
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:51,009
all right so here we go finally let's

41
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:51,009
play along okay

42
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:55,790
I like energy drinks you guys can play

43
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:58,610
along alright so left side is agreed

44
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:00,050
sorry right side is agree left side is

45
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:00,560
disagree I would probably put myself

46
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,509
here

47
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,789
because I drink energy drinks all the

48
00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:10,039
freakin time check out G fuel

49
00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:12,050
enter the code P D pipe back keep

50
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:14,030
jumping he's definitely gonna go for it

51
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:17,150
wait I'm sorry can can you give me a

52
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:18,140
second to think about this this is not a

53
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:23,840
tough question

54
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:25,310
God Oh guys I please maybe drink an

55
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:35,180
energy drink I'll help you figure it out

56
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:37,340
okay damn 50/50 I only like energy

57
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:39,470
drinks with alcohol and easy drink with

58
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:41,720
alcohol isn't that super unhealthy is

59
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:42,380
that really bad many people actually die

60
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,150
from that

61
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:46,190
I definitely acknowledge the health risk

62
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:48,350
that some energy drinks have but for me

63
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:50,660
I mean not if you're drinking G fuel no

64
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:53,150
health risks entered the code PewDiePie

65
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:55,849
I don't know if I can say that yes sure

66
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:57,890
I am sure anxious non-stop having to

67
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:59,220
play at the top of my game and it helps

68
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:02,760
out a lot

69
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:11,580
culture not colliding the definition

70
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:13,170
that I what it's like what's a woman I

71
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,250
needed a definition of that what's a

72
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:16,380
woman tell me right now

73
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:19,380
alright this will be interesting okay

74
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:21,690
left or right I agree or disagree we can

75
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:24,060
already see oh I don't know where I

76
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:26,820
would go I probably go somewhere here

77
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:28,800
just so so I can now I'll go here

78
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:30,750
because any time I see a girl play a

79
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,300
video game and they say they play Halo

80
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:34,410
competitively in reality I just imagine

81
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,600
that they're really just playing

82
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:42,540
runescape and overwatch so I don't

83
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:44,580
really believe it Oh everyone has that

84
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:48,150
experience when they're in a Gaming

85
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:50,190
Lobby and well probably us females

86
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,760
probably experience this more why she

87
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:53,610
said it

88
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:55,350
everyone everyone struggles with it good

89
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:57,300
redic did can have a definition of

90
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:59,670
everyone like what does that mean as

91
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:02,040
soon as we speak we get called fat we

92
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:03,480
get called all these ugly names it

93
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:07,350
happens to me all the time as soon as I

94
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,800
speak fat I get her point I get her

95
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,810
point

96
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,160
she plays runescape okay I understand it

97
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:13,200
happens the line and that is still

98
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:16,080
something I deal with today as I did

99
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:19,229
10-15 years ago it is definitely a

100
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:20,640
terrible thing to experience I have a

101
00:04:19,229 --> 00:04:22,770
girlfriend that dreams though sorry I

102
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,330
feel like I've gotten more open mind not

103
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,800
gonna lie I needed I need a definition

104
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,150
of what a girlfriend is I need about it

105
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,410
and understanding and I can definitely

106
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,910
understand those it's a funny night

107
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:31,800
females have to go through it's pretty

108
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:33,660
tough from people just saying dumb [ __ ]

109
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,430
or saying you're bad saying you

110
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:37,290
shouldn't compete or I think that's a

111
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:40,200
fair thing you don't really notice how

112
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:42,479
much girls get the same kind of dumb

113
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,550
jokes over and over it's like oh why do

114
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,530
you care but it's like it's so run to

115
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:48,630
the ground a lot of that people say to

116
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:50,160
girls online that it's just like it just

117
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:52,050
stopped being funny years ago basically

118
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,460
hear those things too but they don't

119
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:55,080
hear it because they're men you're right

120
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,370
right right they hear it because of

121
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,900
whatever like the internet wants to hate

122
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:59,669
on some manager

123
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:02,130
I disagree though cuz I think in general

124
00:04:59,669 --> 00:05:04,229
people are much harsher on men because

125
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:08,070
oh it's like oh you can take it I'm a

126
00:05:04,229 --> 00:05:10,040
competitor like I don't care about what

127
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:12,470
my gender is

128
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:15,230
what how much I weigh I don't care about

129
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:17,120
any of that like if I'm good enough like

130
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:19,490
that I'm good enough I just don't really

131
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,190
believe in that I think that's a fair

132
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:23,930
argument too and it's like you don't

133
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:25,400
want to be put in a box just because

134
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:27,290
people say oh well it's tough for you

135
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,780
that doesn't mean that you want to be in

136
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:31,460
that and acknowledge that in a way it's

137
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:33,410
like how do we fix these issues well

138
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:36,350
maybe just don't bring it up all the

139
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:37,730
time I don't know no guy is saying yeah

140
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:39,740
you cannot get on your computer because

141
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:45,020
you're a woman like no guy is saying

142
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:47,210
like she's like no I agree with that and

143
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:48,590
like I do agree that the skills speaks

144
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:51,380
for itself I agree with the skills

145
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:53,660
speaks for itself also disagrees with

146
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:56,180
the whole argument what the hell anyone

147
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:58,880
can typically play any game they want

148
00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:00,890
and become good the environment makes it

149
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,440
so that it's much harder to succeed as a

150
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:05,360
woman than it is as a man there's no

151
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,640
doubt that the experience will be

152
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,470
different oh yeah this is different but

153
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,670
I don't think gaming is anti-women

154
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:12,560
I don't know I don't think it's anti

155
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:15,680
women but I don't think that way that

156
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:19,640
way then what are you doing over there I

157
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,830
think there there's just a lot more they

158
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,420
have to deal with um so like back then

159
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:25,760
you know arcades in the first like home

160
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:27,560
consoles girls and video games just

161
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,870
weren't a thing you know it was like a

162
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,370
boys only Club anytime a girl was like

163
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:34,040
interested video games guys would be

164
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:35,150
like oh no just go play make over go

165
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:39,470
back to the kitchen or something about

166
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:41,840
what the hell no sounds like you did

167
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:43,250
that you did that if any in my

168
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:47,150
experience whenever girls wonder place

169
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:50,150
like wait yeah hell yeah no please come

170
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:52,670
join the hell don't project your ideas

171
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:54,020
don't project your misogynistic history

172
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:55,760
and upper compensate for it by

173
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:58,010
government over there gaming culture has

174
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:00,500
advanced right and it's become more

175
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:02,090
accessible and diverse unfortunately

176
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,250
there's still you know some people out

177
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:06,640
there that still treat it like it's the

178
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,640
nineties

179
00:07:11,449 --> 00:07:19,859
oh-oh-oh

180
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:20,699
someone agreed Oh take your because

181
00:07:19,859 --> 00:07:22,379

182
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:24,479
Wow I just want to like kind of not be

183
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:26,489
the odd one out the only reason I want

184
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:29,159
to say a little bit here is because

185
00:07:26,489 --> 00:07:32,639
anyone remembers Columbine like they

186
00:07:29,159 --> 00:07:35,609
were inspired by video games but like

187
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:38,669
it's just all mental health at the end

188
00:07:35,609 --> 00:07:41,099
of the day I just think anyone who who

189
00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:42,959
has those kinds of issues is gonna find

190
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:45,119
that inspiration from any kind of medium

191
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:47,909
including movies including games

192
00:07:45,119 --> 00:07:50,159
including books that's why I'm saying we

193
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:51,509
need to censor all of it all media it's

194
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:53,309
not kind of going against the argument

195
00:07:51,509 --> 00:07:55,469
though you're basically saying that all

196
00:07:53,309 --> 00:07:57,779
of these things are encouraging it it's

197
00:07:55,469 --> 00:07:59,879
kind of disingenuous to say that video

198
00:07:57,779 --> 00:08:02,129
games doesn't and at least some way

199
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:04,979
encourage it hear me out hear me out I

200
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:06,929
finish thought because any medium will

201
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:09,089
inspire you in a way doesn't mean it

202
00:08:06,929 --> 00:08:11,369
encourages it I think that key word is

203
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:13,559
encourage inspire it could inspire

204
00:08:11,369 --> 00:08:15,599
violence I would say I just think it's

205
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:18,299
disingenuous to say that because we all

206
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,949
know they do these things that you can't

207
00:08:18,299 --> 00:08:22,319
argue against that but I think the

208
00:08:19,949 --> 00:08:24,479
argument that putting video games in a

209
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,869
specific box saying okay well it's their

210
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,209
fault

211
00:08:24,869 --> 00:08:29,159
that's completely pointless and doesn't

212
00:08:27,209 --> 00:08:31,319
solve any issue whatsoever

213
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:33,599
does that make sense I don't think there

214
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:35,579
would be such controversial topics Jesus

215
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,779
Christ there's so many of us that play

216
00:08:35,579 --> 00:08:38,550
video games that don't have those kind

217
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:41,360
of thoughts how would it it's like your

218
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:41,360
site it's just a scapegoat

219
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:57,500
what oh okay good for traditional sports

220
00:08:54,830 --> 00:09:00,050
you have to push your body to such

221
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:02,450
lengths to be able to do those physical

222
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:05,840
feats to be them yes whatever I just

223
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:08,120
don't think that it's as hard I agree

224
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:11,930
I'm usually like sitting on my computer

225
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:14,060
for almost 10 to 12 hours a day that's

226
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:16,820
physically demanding alright I'm not

227
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:19,250
doing anything near and NFL NBA players

228
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:21,140
do anything I don't play basketball but

229
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:23,630
I don't think that they're working on

230
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:27,080
like frames-per-second kinds of levels

231
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:29,240
of reaction and speed yeah in basketball

232
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,790
players they will never understand the

233
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:34,030
frames per second he strongly agrees

234
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:36,140
then you know not all sports are as

235
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:38,090
intensive as like football and like

236
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:39,860
soccer and you probably all thinking

237
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:41,750
basketball for me yeah what are you

238
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:43,610
talking about right bio chefs

239
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:45,860
it's a sport too and that's equally

240
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:47,510
physically demanding imagine a pro Matta

241
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:50,410
and video game player meeting them up

242
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:52,610
with a real football player be like yeah

243
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:56,600
we're pretty much the same we're pretty

244
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:59,360
much we pretty much put out the same

245
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:01,610
amount of physical work I met a lot of

246
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,680
people that are professional eSport and

247
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:05,660
I know it's highly demanding but I don't

248
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,580
think physically it's that it's the same

249
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:10,450
thing because it's like it's the

250
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:12,740
mainstream stuff you know because

251
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:16,220
there's also but there's also golf

252
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:18,260
there's also arts in bowling darts

253
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:20,030
almost a question competitive gaming is

254
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:21,980
just demanding as a physical sport a

255
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:23,540
physical sport when people say physical

256
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:28,700
sport they generally not talking about

257
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:31,320
bowling are they or darts trash talk

258
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:34,549
it's part of the fun

259
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,549
[Music]

260
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:39,690
damn it's hella fun it's competition you

261
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:40,710
know you trying to get everyone riled up

262
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:42,600
you turned out to throw everyone off

263
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:46,350
their game he's waiting for this one

264
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:48,900
yeah you know once we will start taking

265
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:50,580
like life problems and wait and try to

266
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:53,360
like find stuff up on you that's where

267
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:55,710
it gets petty and it's childish but um

268
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,570
trash-talking is super fun I do it a lot

269
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:59,760
on stream you know I'd yeah I mean I

270
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:01,890
love I love trash-talking people it's so

271
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,900
fun I never seen people bond so much of

272
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:06,950
our topic Jesus Christ Chuck you know

273
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,950
brings people together

274
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:13,020
I only say it on the mic because then

275
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:16,740
you can tell like you can understand my

276
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:19,920
tone is women calling us virgins all the

277
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:28,830
time it's not fair it's or not being a

278
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:32,580
woman also virgin family's skeptical

279
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:37,460
about career okay let's see their varied

280
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:40,410
them I'll start wait I don't understand

281
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:42,390
why does it say oh it's the Instagram

282
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:44,760
poll oh okay I was wondering why that

283
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:46,350
was different all the time damn so this

284
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:48,300
is kind of like what you guys would say

285
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:50,070
I mean my parents did a very similar

286
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:52,230
thing and after I graduated high school

287
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:54,210
I asked for a chance I was like hey

288
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:55,500
could I have just a year I want to

289
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:57,390
really see if I can make this work you

290
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,710
know I want to pursue - pretty fair he

291
00:11:57,390 --> 00:12:01,890
asked your parents won the tournament

292
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:04,170
the course shot of him yeah if this was

293
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:06,210
three years ago I'd say I'd be over

294
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:07,650
there saying baby they'd be skeptical

295
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:09,150
dead I don't know but my dad's always

296
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:10,800
been supportive of me and I'm thankful

297
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:13,589
for that they understand it when they

298
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,060
see the money yeah you have to make

299
00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:17,580
money for people to realize it's

300
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:20,120
actually a career yeah you sure well

301
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:23,220
that's the definition of the career

302
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,600
it's so fun judging people that are just

303
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:27,030
throwing away sentence that's not

304
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:29,010
thinking about it and then I can go what

305
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:31,830
a bunch of idiots I've never said

306
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:33,750
anything stupid in my life

307
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:35,190
YouTube is great to be fair I had the

308
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,990
same struggle by the way like my parents

309
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:39,360
when I talked about youth it was like no

310
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:41,520
no you're not doing this to be fair it

311
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,940
wasn't even a thing then that's right

312
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:45,560
I helped out gamers now when kids go and

313
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:49,529
say

314
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:55,610
but parents will be like now no even

315
00:12:49,529 --> 00:12:57,839
more you're welcome oh great

316
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:59,550
actually I'll probably put disagree

317
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,250
because generally my gaming videos don't

318
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:09,180
do that well anymore so yes probably

319
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:10,709
strongly disagree so it depends on what

320
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:13,860
you guys to find us good living god this

321
00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:15,449
guy can you stop being contrarian in

322
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,190
every point depends on what you guys to

323
00:13:15,449 --> 00:13:19,470
find us good living I live in Silicon

324
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:21,690
Valley in the Bay Area the highest cost

325
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:23,880
of living ever this competitive gaming

326
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:26,399
career I have is it's a side hustle but

327
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:28,259
then move it somewhere else I'm poor

328
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,269
it's not a good job because I live in

329
00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:32,160
expensive area what if I just did any

330
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:34,139
one of those by itself I would not make

331
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,720
it I used to live in a trailer with my

332
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:38,190
dad in Ohio so I understand the struggle

333
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,660
you know I used to sleep on the mattress

334
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:41,730
on a floor

335
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:43,290
you know gaming I started streaming I

336
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:45,120
started you know getting a lot of

337
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:46,920
attention in tournaments I was making a

338
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,660
lot of money there I mean now I live in

339
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,459
like in the really nice part of

340
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:52,589
California like rent free with my

341
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:55,339
girlfriend and there's a lot of money to

342
00:13:52,589 --> 00:13:59,069
be made in gaming whether it's streaming

343
00:13:55,339 --> 00:14:01,110
YouTube tournaments sponsorships the

344
00:13:59,069 --> 00:14:04,079
World Cup that was like 30 million like

345
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:06,540
there's just the reason why I'm not on

346
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:08,940
stream strongly agree is because it's so

347
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:10,410
unreliable and inconsistent in my

348
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:13,050
opinion which is something that's pretty

349
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:15,420
fair ya know if we're gonna place topic

350
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:18,060
i'm i agree with Ariana comment payouts

351
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:19,199
can take months i i'd say i make a

352
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,819
really good living i think that

353
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,620
fortnight has given me a lot of

354
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:25,920
opportunities I mean the viewership and

355
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:27,690
the tournament prize winnings alone is

356
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,889
ridiculous I mean even for me I've

357
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:30,449
always just looked at YouTube like oh

358
00:14:28,889 --> 00:14:35,089
yeah it's pretty on a reliable job

359
00:14:30,449 --> 00:14:35,089
I probably shouldn't take it seriously

360
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:44,840
[Music]

361
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:47,570
we guess all of them because they only

362
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:49,280
play video games all day big surprise

363
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:50,900
like sure and we just have the time of

364
