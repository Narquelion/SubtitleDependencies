76
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,160
on the internet is not to ask a question

77
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,319
it's to post the wrong answer

78
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,280

82
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,159

86
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,480
go wrong

87
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,440

88
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,440

91
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,000
this is cunningham's law and not

92
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,239
murphy's law

93
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,680

95
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,440
i just got played so hard i've seen this

96
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,040

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,959
knew because a lot of times you don't

101
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,200

102
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,799

103
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,799
