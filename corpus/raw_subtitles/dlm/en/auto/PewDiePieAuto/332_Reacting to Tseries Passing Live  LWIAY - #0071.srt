1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,870
we did it yatta destiny first 290

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,840
million oh boy

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:12,929
tea service was right behind us but we

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,360
did it oh man it took us a nice very

5
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:17,430
nice thank you everyone

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,800
I can't believe everything is just

7
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:22,890
changing so quickly you have all these

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,960
news articles Priya is it called

9
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:28,740
preemptively preemptively

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:31,140
yeah preemptively celebrating the fact

11
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:33,329
that tea's serious has passed us but oh

12
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,790
no no I think it's important to know

13
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:37,500
that unless we have a common goal this

14
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,719
is just gonna go on forever

15
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,239
and I think we've proven ourselves that

16
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:45,090
we're more than capable of doing just

17
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,770
that okay but if we don't have a common

18
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,289
goal then we're just gonna look like a

19
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:51,780
bunch of idiots we're never good this is

20
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:54,149
just gonna go on forever which it easily

21
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,430
can by the way which is fine but we're

22
00:00:54,149 --> 00:01:00,930
more than that we have more integrity

23
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:04,559
than that we're not don't care okay it's

24
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:06,960
first to 100 million and then we will

25
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,960
let t-series passes you will have my

26
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,869
permission to pass after we hit a

27
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,960
hundred million I will write full a step

28
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:18,659
aside I will graciously step aside and

29
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:23,119
let you pass these theories leave your

30
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:23,119
entry pros

31
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:32,299
why using the Drake format using the new

32
00:01:29,869 --> 00:01:35,420
Marzia format because Marzia memes get

33
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:37,179
more uploads imputes me what i can do

34
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:40,340
funny faces guys please

35
00:01:37,179 --> 00:01:41,329

37
00:01:41,329 --> 00:01:45,140
I don't understand at least where

38
00:01:43,219 --> 00:01:47,659
actions anymore just don't forget about

39
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:50,479
me when I lose to t series that's all I

40
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:52,520
guess well it's not gonna happen it's

41
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,280
not losing if we let him win

42
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,679

the headphones changed ah oh my god this

80
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:52,970
is so embarrassing yeah our minds I

81
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:54,950
thought the game was relevant they told

82
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:57,950

83
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:59,720
so relevant and I'm like this is awesome

84
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:02,930
I'll tell everyone how relevant the game

85
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:06,760
is I felt so disappointed

86
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:06,760
while I made pewds what an amazing guy

87
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:14,390
next me Thank You Shane

88
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:17,630
very cool he said something I appreciate

89
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:19,430
a lot in his video today almost nights a

90
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:22,250
thing that I did mention in that video

91
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:24,200
is that I said that I watched him back

92
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:25,610
in the day but I like Shane a lot more

93
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,680
now because he seems like he's more

94
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:30,530
honest and open with himself and I think

95
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,790
that's the thing with YouTube that I

96
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:34,340
really like so

97
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:37,700
keep going Shane you're doing great it

98
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:43,010
works i screen recorded and uploaded a

99
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:46,040
video with a song Oh hit books so

100
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:48,770
there's this theory that it's not a

101
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:50,720
theory but this is mean that to fight if

102
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:53,030
you don't know the name of a song just

103
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,250
upload it to YouTube because they have

104
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:58,850
all this advanced technology to claim

105
00:04:55,250 --> 00:05:00,830
the video it's so it will say what song

106
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:02,510
it is because they will get claim well

107
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:04,820
if you upload it and someone did it

108
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:06,820
hi dragon boy yo the Content ID claim ur

109
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:09,530
is time is on my side

110
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:11,960
claimed by um G I think I heard

111
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:15,040
somewhere the reason why you can't sing

112
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,040
happy birthday on

113
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,009
is that the one sing happy birthday and

114
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,840
it will cost you

115
00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:23,970
turns out the pablor song is under

116
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,250
copyright performers are supposed to pay

117
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:27,479
do not you're not allowed to sing it

118
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:30,990
happy birthday to you

119
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:33,389
at restaurants because it's not licensed

120
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:35,819
just to give you a taste of how bad then

121
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:38,909
in my opinion the music industry is with

122
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:41,150
with protecting the artists it is

123
00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:43,650
certain no integrity involved with

124
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:47,310
sharing something that you created I

125
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:49,650
don't get this idea but it's literally

126
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:52,139
the same thing here on YouTube even if I

127
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:54,300
hum a song that's enough for a video to

128
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:57,719
get claimed entirely

129
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:59,729
I can't wait for article 13 I really

130
00:05:57,719 --> 00:06:02,580
hope I'm just imagining things

131
00:05:59,729 --> 00:06:09,210
Oh God break out on forehead bags under
