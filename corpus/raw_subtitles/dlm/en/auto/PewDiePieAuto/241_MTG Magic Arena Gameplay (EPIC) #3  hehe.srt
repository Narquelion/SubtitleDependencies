1
00:00:02,149 --> 00:00:21,930
all right so what does he have there it

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:23,550
is ha ha ha nice you got it bye that's

3
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:26,730
just what I wanted to happen

4
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:28,439
what's up gamers magic time please look

5
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,970
like a baby the video place behaves but

6
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,949
hey hey if you don't know anything about

7
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,260
card games or magic all you need to know

8
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:35,610
no you need to know a lot of things how

9
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,280
do I treat this video I don't know

10
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:40,530
everyone plays the same King deck okay

11
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,540
there's a limited a bunch of cards and

12
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,789
people have figured out okay this is the

13
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,100
best combination of cards so everyone

14
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:48,809
just plays the same goddamn decks all

15
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,820
over again you can play a deck that

16
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:53,309
everyone else plays or you could play

17
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:56,250
something that is good against these

18
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:58,800
decks an answer to that is angry white

19
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,629
woman we had hunted witness very good

20
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,030
day against mana read a two-for-one

21
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:05,400
trade of legions landing good form on

22
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:08,070
the red titty shaker good against mana

23
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,260
blue die your fleet daredevil I love

24
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:11,010
this card so much very underutilized

25
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,570
card

26
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,450
hopefully we get to see some action of

27
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:18,240
it maybe you shouldn't have lava coil

28
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:20,159
big lava coil just good removal just

29
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,350
strike it's nice to have an instant

30
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,330
removal resplendent angel and breakable

31
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:27,030
formation I only have a breakable

32
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:28,799
formation for expert control Legion war

33
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,990
boss because it helps flipping the

34
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,909
legions landing and again if you have

35
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,729
unbreakable formation with it it's very

36
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:37,860
nice excellent finding self-explanatory

37
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:38,579
rekindling Felix because Felix really

38
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,590
because why not

39
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:42,119
Aurelia it's my favorite card of the

40
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,880
deck it's so good and then of course

41
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:47,070
Lyra three Liars because you

42
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,110
I literally just hit mythic rank again

43
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:51,119
third time baby feels good man

44
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:53,250
my name is now PewDiePie forever number

45
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,990
one because someone reported my name

46
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,689
thanks for that appreciate that

47
00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:00,060
it used to be asked like her 47 and then

48
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:03,180
someone reported my name and then that

49
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:05,040
just led to me asking to change it I

50
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,649
changed it into a bunch of joke name so

51
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,729
I added like fortnight game or 47 or

52
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:12,010
like played against

53
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:15,069
musashi you don't see green a lot these

54
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:18,489
days I pick for that gamer or like smoke

55
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:20,470
bush for 19 plus one and then they just

56
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:22,269
basically dabbed on me and said I don't

57
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:24,629
have any removal I'm basically screwed

58
00:02:22,269 --> 00:02:26,650
here titty shaker go

59
00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:29,319
apparently I have the attention span of

60
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:31,840
a five-year-old they changed my name to

61
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:33,400
sub T series that's it that was the

62
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,920
point of the story yeah this game is

63
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,049
lost I don't know what to tell you guys

64
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:40,090
there you go it begins the pain begins

65
00:02:38,049 --> 00:02:42,040
I'd literally used to run for two

66
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:44,709
counties just against these kind of

67
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:48,780
decks but I never see them anymore so I

68
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:48,780
just removed them but I guess here we go

69
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:57,790
holy how much thinking do you need

70
00:02:52,840 --> 00:03:00,489
to make you did it congratulations

71
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:01,690
now give me a lava coil alright

72
00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:04,209
this game is over I don't know what to

73
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:09,130
tell you guys I could flip the legions

74
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:10,780
but that would cost me two creatures but

75
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:14,380
also what do I have to lose at this

76
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:16,840
point then then if we draw a line right

77
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:18,910
now that's the only way I really see

78
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:26,620
this oh you figured out which one to

79
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:29,200
block with Congrats you idiot you fool I

80
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:31,690
had hunted witness all along please no

81
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,150
mana okay there's no mana great

82
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:34,989
he literally has no mana that's amazing

83
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:38,170
hey look at that

84
00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:39,850
okay so now he wants to play his disc

85
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:43,500
our next turn so I don't think he'll

86
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:46,640
take the block and that means we can

87
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:52,700
what am i doing what am i doing

88
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:54,620
I did not expect that okay

89
00:03:52,700 --> 00:04:00,590
you place the Rangers right he gets

90
00:03:54,620 --> 00:04:09,230
lives and cards and good times and I get

91
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:11,980
to suck dick if we draw Mountain extern

92
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:14,300
we're in pretty good shape

93
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:20,709
let's just keep attacking with our air

94
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:23,270
support keep the pressure on this [ __ ]

95
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:27,080
it's not as long as it doesn't play any

96
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:29,920
good cards I think we're okay oh I just

97
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:33,740
noticed 1069 he has a lot of cards

98
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:36,020
that's a lot of cards play the lion

99
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,880
maybe this pro tip you can you can play

100
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,920
that Lane I don't know if you knew about

101
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,300
this but you can play lions did he hold

102
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:47,030
her to play a Landis turn I didn't pay

103
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:50,200
attention so he has four mana maybe he's

104
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:54,140
contemplating playing the crack the

105
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:56,210
snake flyer because that's usually what

106
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:59,120
 all right you played the lion you

107
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:00,770
did it you didn't pay the life for it

108
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:06,560
though so that means he's not playing to

109
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:06,950
snake this turn taking a long time here

110
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,350
buddy

111
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:15,620
taking a very long time by the gods

112
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:17,030
you're taking a very long time I don't

113
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:19,160
know if you knew about this but you

114
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:22,160
taking a Barrett he did it got sad isn't

115
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,900
it alright I wish he had gone for my

116
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:41,150
angel

117
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:42,470
but I guess air support go [ __ ] oh you

118
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:49,479
believe in land again

119
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:49,479
 no no get away get away oh yeah no

120
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:56,319
maybe your [ __ ] oh he played another

121
00:05:54,169 --> 00:05:59,110
elf that cheeky [ __ ]

122
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:02,399
ah I need another line it would be so

123
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:06,819
good if I got a lot of line all right

124
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:16,499
you go there you go there and you guys

125
00:06:06,819 --> 00:06:19,469
just sit tie it all right I okay well I

126
00:06:16,499 --> 00:06:22,899
should have played Legion more bus and

127
00:06:19,469 --> 00:06:26,860
landing that I prefer our support right

128
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:29,349
now if we can draw a line next turn then

129
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:32,409
it's pretty much over because then I can

130
00:06:29,349 --> 00:06:36,309
activate the ability we get to token

131
00:06:32,409 --> 00:06:45,999
angels and well it's over regardless I

132
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:47,619
have lethal next turn but yeah it's a

133
00:06:45,999 --> 00:06:48,159
clamp his ass cheeks though I don't

134
00:06:47,619 --> 00:06:49,569
think so

135
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:52,119
that's strange I guess he wanted to

136
00:06:49,569 --> 00:06:56,490
double play I would have gone for more

137
00:06:52,119 --> 00:06:56,490
buff on the snake I guess he wants life

138
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:07,899
he knows there you go no I'm missing oh

139
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:13,930
it's a red land it's a red land oh that

140
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:16,589
sucks it really sucks ooh ooh I wonder

141
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:19,180
if this works no way it doesn't I

142
00:07:16,589 --> 00:07:20,830
thought if I can activate this then

143
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:23,409
flick the landing and then get another

144
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:25,860
white mana but I need this to activate

145
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:25,860
this turn

146
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:39,890
okay we're just gonna god damn that

147
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:42,050
sucks could I could I have done that

148
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:45,110
I'll try next turn I'll try next turn if

149
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:56,210
I can but now the game is stalled so I

150
00:07:45,110 --> 00:08:01,670
don't think this is Gigi anymore red

151
00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:04,580
mana can't believe it or red mana pure

152
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:08,060
ready I think I only have like ah God it

153
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:09,620
begins the pain you're just pulling the

154
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:18,890
best cards you could possibly pull

155
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:21,800
aren't you I don't like this I don't

156
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:24,700
like this game anymore this does not

157
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,700
look good for me at all

158
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:39,140
that look okay alright give me the white

159
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:40,970
mana so I know I can activate this

160
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:44,150
ability during combat and kind of trick

161
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:47,230
him to kill the snake but I don't trust

162
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:47,230
this game a lot of the times

163
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:05,220
he could choose to kill my flier but I'd

164
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,740
rather make sure that baby and dives in

165
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:13,020
case he just decided to block my

166
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:16,370
resplendent angel you know what I mean

167
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:16,370
you know what I mean

168
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:23,800
I like where they always look at the

169
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:31,959
bottom ones like they're flying [ __ ] oh

170
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:33,550
he did do that okay interesting so

171
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:35,950
unless you can pull another Vivian out

172
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:38,769
of your ass it's not looking too good

173
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:40,060
for you another Vivian or a snake that's

174
00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:41,589
all I don't want to see you can do

175
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:43,449
whatever you want in between there or

176
00:09:41,589 --> 00:09:44,860
finality okay there's a lot of cards

177
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:47,829
that he could pull out of his ass

178
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:51,399
that one I'm fine with go ahead go ahead

179
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:53,829
I don't care yeah yeah yeah get go yeah

180
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:55,990
you guys you got a bunch of lanes but

181
00:09:53,829 --> 00:10:07,750
you ain't got no snakes what I call it a

182
00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:09,820
snake it looks like a snake oh now I can

183
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:26,320
activate the ability oh well doesn't

184
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:29,079
matter who do we mentor the life link we

185
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,300
don't have lethal we're one against

186
00:10:29,079 --> 00:10:34,240
lethal he has to block with the snake

187
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:39,790
well he doesn't have to he'd be wise to

188
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:44,470
block with a snake oh you blocked that

189
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:50,529
one with the snake why all right so he's

190
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:52,269
down to one health next turn and we

191
00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:53,769
don't have to buff it cuz the life link

192
00:10:52,269 --> 00:11:01,990
of this will give us the triggered

193
00:10:53,769 --> 00:11:06,870
ability anyway shut okay I got nothing

194
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:11,260
oh you doctor one now [ __ ] and now you

195
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:13,540
should met shouldn't that trigger why

196
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:17,580
did it not trigger oh that one didn't

197
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:19,990
have life link okay I'm an idiot bye

198
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:22,060
doesn't matter doesn't matter that I

199
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:24,430
miscalculated and did a couple of

200
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:26,680
misplace because I'm the best gamer of

201
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:28,750
the world you guys don't understand

202
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:31,870
don't even try to have your pre built

203
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:34,270
shitty decks going Oh guru's pretty good

204
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:42,070
pathetic the epic I can't play anything

205
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:47,610
turn one that's always fun oh my

206
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:50,680
god this again alright take this

207
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:55,120
moustache man go paranoid moustache man

208
00:11:50,680 --> 00:12:00,160
that would kill him not God Jesus Christ

209
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:02,920
the synergy begins a talk yeah cool I

210
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,510
have no removal this is epic do I block

211
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:07,030
that I feel like I need to save it for a

212
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:08,860
later block health collectors is gonna

213
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:12,640
get stronger now I can't play

214
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:14,740
resplendent I can't play anything I'm

215
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:17,350
basically I don't want to play dire

216
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:19,390
fleet daredevil but I also don't think

217
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:24,520
this guy plays any spells

218
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:29,320
usually these kind of decks don't so

219
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:33,160
we'll see he shocks himself to play

220
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:36,880
another I hope he doesn't get buffed it

221
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:38,940
does cool that means Pelt protector gets

222
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,650
buffed as well that's awesome

223
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:43,060
or does it it doesn't okay nevermind

224
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:53,020
then I don't know how they works I never

225
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:55,270
play with it um tricky tricky tricky hmm

226
00:12:53,020 --> 00:13:00,040
how many does he have a graveyard one so

227
00:12:55,270 --> 00:13:05,790
if he plays a crowd 3 it will be 4 or so

228
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:11,380
you won't die so I can play this now and

229
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:15,010
I can buff this guy and most likely they

230
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:17,740
won't take the block they might either

231
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:20,650
way I get life back which I gladly take

232
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:23,650
I probably should have tried to flip the

233
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:25,420
Legion they're actually open another

234
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:28,540
creature died he gets buff that's how it

235
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:30,910
works how do I not know that that's

236
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:33,070
really good whenever a creature you

237
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:35,080
control and divide it or dies if that

238
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:37,570
creatures power is greater oh I see okay

239
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:41,730
you know these things

240
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:41,730
alright is he gonna play this guy yeah

241
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:49,890
alright so what do I want to do here I

242
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:58,620
feel like I want to flip the Legion but

243
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:58,620
it doesn't seem worth it right now

244
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:07,180
oh really I can put pressure for now dye

245
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:09,630
fleet daredevil will hold off anymore

246
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,630
fault

247
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:18,300
this is have trample no it isn't okay

248
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:24,359

should I let that one slide what could

262
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:22,080
he have he could have moment of craving

263
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:22,080
doesn't matter he's that anyway

264
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:35,260
nice good move that was really good no

265
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:47,660
he tricked back he doesn't know I have

266
00:15:40,670 --> 00:16:02,600
explained it angel it's fine [ __ ] what

267
00:15:47,660 --> 00:16:03,530
else do you got yeah yes keep staring at

268
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:12,950
it see what happens

269
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:15,530
oh you thought you could trick the trick

270
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:17,090
sir I didn't trick him at all he tricked

271
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:21,980
me but I just had a second car that

272
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:26,660
could win oh why I love magic

273
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:27,470
so fun he thought he had me that's

274
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:29,030
hilarious

275
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:30,680
I was acting cocky too even though I

276
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:35,990
know he could have had something against

277
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:39,620
me but thank God I that could have been

278
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:42,620
really humiliating for sure I don't love

279
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:46,730
this hand I could potentially have three

280
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:53,030
dead cards but what are you gonna do

281
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:57,170
69 epic what do I play I'll pay it could

282
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:58,640
be mana red I would suck it but so far I

283
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:59,630
haven't seen it in mythic how great is

284
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:04,400
s4 gg

285
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:06,890
like I said three dead cards sorry let's

286
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,700
attack for one and then he 19 rounds

287
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:14,450
he's dead

288
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:19,930
seems like a solid plan to me how can

289
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:21,950
you still play it oh he's not Esper what

290
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:29,210
then what are you

291
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:31,529
titty shaker he plays titty shaker what

292
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:37,740
alright I'll go for a taxi betrayed

293
00:17:31,529 --> 00:17:40,940
doubted nope but I have another paranoid

294
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,940
mustache man yeah

295
00:17:41,149 --> 00:17:48,389
squeeze one damage out of here I don't

296
00:17:45,929 --> 00:17:51,450
like when they are God it begins yeah I

297
00:17:48,389 --> 00:17:53,279
thought every sure so what would I take

298
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:57,110
if I was him I don't know what cards he

299
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:57,110
adds probably exelon yeah

300
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:05,430
Oh God the thing I hate about thought

301
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,900
race is that they get to survey

302
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:08,460
afterwards so not only do you have to

303
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:10,230
wait for them to decide which card to

304
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:12,780
pick the olds have to decide what car to

305
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:13,490
pick in they're an [ __ ] I don't like

306
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:19,680
it okay

307
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:24,690
let's attack what are you gonna do with

308
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:28,140
mr. titty shaker a lot of thought

309
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:38,400
process going into this decision to

310
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:39,630
damage that is a considerable amount he

311
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,810
managed to make a decision

312
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:44,730
absolutely incredible okay if

313
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:46,650
resplendent angel doesn't die this turn

314
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:50,690
I think we might be in a good shape but

315
00:18:46,650 --> 00:19:00,740
I also see a removal coming probably

316
00:18:50,690 --> 00:19:06,090
cast down or a jihad nany all right I

317
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:07,710
Johnny what is this deck all right

318
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:12,720
you're gonna buff the titty shaker come

319
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:18,660
on Jesus Christ just do it you did it

320
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:21,660
congratulations I think I'll just say

321
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:25,020
he'll go to six I need two turns to kill

322
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:30,600
him yeah I think the best way does a

323
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:33,240
whole lot for now he will he will buff

324
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:36,390
titty shaker next turn so I can't block

325
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:37,920
him with a hundred witness so

326
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:39,090
technically I should probably keep

327
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:43,530
attacking right now

328
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:47,690
but regardless Johnny will be dead next

329
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:47,690
time I don't feel like wasting tokens

330
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:57,530
lash out

331
00:19:52,110 --> 00:20:00,530
Oh dah so does have any I'm more

332
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:00,530
creepers

333
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:04,850
then also potentially forget an

334
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:08,750
allegiance landing a car

335
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:10,640
what is this deck I see what he draws

336
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:14,210
then I'm legit curious now we get to see

337
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,950
some stuff at least what exile target

338
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:17,240
creature put two loyal encounters on a

339
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:24,320
Plains Walker

340
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:27,380
it's a planeswalker deck exile target

341
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:29,920
creature I don't like that don't examine

342
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,920
my creatures

343
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:35,900
well now it's like now I have to kill

344
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:37,540
car all right we'll see if we draw he

345
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:40,280
doesn't attack he's a boy

346
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:44,440
interesting ok so we can't play your IRA

347
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:46,760
this turn but we can next one

348
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:55,100
unbreakable formation won't do anything

349
00:20:46,760 --> 00:21:03,680
against exile do we want to use them

350
00:20:55,100 --> 00:21:06,250
right it's too late to use it now ok no

351
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:13,940
what am i doing I was supposed oh

352
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:17,750
 [ __ ] you dumbass alright I can

353
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:19,580
I can save this it was a plan - it was a

354
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:21,680
plan to play justice strike next turned

355
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:23,830
out that was the plan sure let's go with

356
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,830
that

357
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:35,350
alright so now he'll - Karn no he

358
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:35,350
doesn't ok you get a lion

359
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:44,120
it's oh it's if the French it's a friend

360
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:45,850
stick so the titty shaker is just a

361
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:50,000
distraction it's literally just to keep

362
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:52,490
something on the board I like this kind

363
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,600
of decks but if he goes on too long

364
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:55,600
we're gonna be in trouble

365
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:02,170
deal combat damage well that's not gonna

366
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:02,170
happen

367
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:07,700
are you are you gonna deal combat damage

368
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,840
alright

369
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:18,269
so it's a bit [ __ ] to play this on

370
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:22,049
his turn but oh god I'm actually

371
00:22:18,269 --> 00:22:31,830
[ __ ] now we can actually

372
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:33,389
brain-dead let's go for con the Miss

373
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:39,359
plays I'm making is just freaking

374
00:22:33,389 --> 00:22:58,349
pathetic why why would you not block her

375
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:59,909
splendid angel why why weird alright so

376
00:22:58,349 --> 00:23:01,919
he goes for the exile card he'll

377
00:22:59,909 --> 00:23:03,599
probably use it on Lyra but we have

378
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:07,409
another lion he doesn't know about that

379
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:14,999
so it doesn't really matter he actually

380
00:23:07,409 --> 00:23:18,889
just saves us some time well that might

381
00:23:14,999 --> 00:23:18,889
be annoying is it that fast

382
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:37,410
that sucks we might just have to go for

383
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:45,240
his face yeah we might just have to go

384
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:55,530
for his face I'll kill that all right so

385
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:59,940
now the goal is to ignore Jace and just

386
00:23:55,530 --> 00:24:01,260
go for its face that rhymed as well

387
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:05,179
doesn't make me so anxious to play

388
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:07,559
against I don't know what's happening I

389
00:24:05,179 --> 00:24:09,780
mean it has a bored wife I'm pretty much

390
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:18,059
screwed we lost our only protection for

391
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:21,030
it you never see people playing Jays

392
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:24,660
it's really interesting it's not a good

393
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:26,370
card maybe if you have oath of Teferi

394
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:30,510
you can make it work I'm surprised you

395
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:36,440
managed to get it too it's just too many

396
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:36,440
Planeswalkers pong play tribunal by Lara

397
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:42,090
it's okay we can still activate

398
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:43,650
resplendent Angels ability so it doesn't

399
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:46,280
really matter he doesn't have any flight

400
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:46,280
control

401
00:24:50,040 --> 00:25:00,600
yeah all right oh I think I'll save it

402
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:06,210
just because if there's a bored wife I'm

403
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:10,650
screwed basically so we have lethal next

404
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:12,780
turn anyway so unless you have a bored

405
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:26,400
white I think it's sayonara I miss

406
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:28,320
service cilona considering how long he's

407
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:35,640
thinking about it I don't think he has

408
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:39,419
support why all right going into the

409
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:42,270
thinking phase thinking hard oh no not

410
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:47,610
more not more tokens on the ground what

411
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:50,309
will I ever do I guess his tactic is

412
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:53,460
really just to get these out as

413
00:25:50,309 --> 00:25:55,530
protection and not roll like if I had a

414
00:25:53,460 --> 00:26:01,830
deck like this I would run settle to the

415
00:25:55,530 --> 00:26:05,000
wreckage or he attacks or something like

416
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:05,000
that you know

417
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:14,950
so no combat damage has been done he

418
00:26:10,149 --> 00:26:16,990
hasn't spent any money yet and I just

419
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:18,940
barley fell because I blocked the titty

420
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:22,840
shaker cuz I'm actually a freaking brain

421
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:28,200
light I was a good move

422
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:28,200
I'm an idiot I forgot about the plier

423
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:47,769
that was a pretty bad miss play on me I

424
00:26:40,149 --> 00:26:49,659
gotta say there was really no reason for

425
00:26:47,769 --> 00:26:53,010
me to block the titty shaker I just saw

426
00:26:49,659 --> 00:26:53,010
it I don't want him to draw another card

427
00:26:58,019 --> 00:27:05,019
that's a lot of clicking to do yeah it's

428
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,820
kind of cool I never see people play

429
00:27:05,019 --> 00:27:09,669
this I played it in one neck

430
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:13,450
alright I don't have a no I have a

431
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:18,480
choice I can block all of these I'd

432
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:18,480
rather keep him from drawing cards

433
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:25,080
tonight the malleus it's good game

434
00:27:28,009 --> 00:27:35,370
yeah I don't really feel good about that

435
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:37,169
one I'm not gonna lie that was pretty

436
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:41,279
tame three in a row baby

437
00:27:37,169 --> 00:27:44,970
let's make four angry white women you

438
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:46,620
don't understand the power it's really

439
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:51,240
not that good of a dick I hope people

440
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:54,200
don't watch Mona blue potentially have

441
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:54,200
not played that in a while

442
00:27:54,499 --> 00:28:00,210
it's definitely mana blue considering

443
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:03,659
that hey he opted everyone Wow

444
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:10,820
oh he went for top I don't like that I

445
00:28:03,659 --> 00:28:10,820
do not like that no it's not mana blue

446
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:17,220
coil

447
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:20,399
why would you waste a lava coil on a in

448
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:21,659
hunted witness that's really good that

449
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,460
he played that because we have dire

450
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:28,289
fleet daredevil I will not play that

451
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:31,440
then any extra lava coils again Drake is

452
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:37,350
as amazing he basically gave us one

453
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:39,210
obviously he doesn't know that so Drake

454
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:40,919
or Phoenix's you just have to keep

455
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:43,230
paying attention to their graveyard to

456
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:47,269
see if the Phoenix is in there it isn't

457
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:51,360
so far the longer that goes the better

458
00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:55,279
again no reason to play anything until

459
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,279
turn four

460
00:28:55,700 --> 00:29:01,010
depending on what he plays now okay

461
00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:05,930
perfect it's tempting for me to just

462
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:16,210
play exons binding as a Bigfoot you he's

463
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:16,210
tapped out as well and yeah why not hey

464
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:23,690
usually red-blue doesn't have any

465
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:26,540
enchantment removal see there it is

466
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:29,540
there's the Phoenix he hard casted it

467
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:32,050
and here's me laughing my ass off

468
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:35,330
because your Phoenix has gone forever

469
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:39,830
sayonara Phoenix Sun maybe you shouldn't

470
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:46,190
have lava coil [ __ ] why is he not

471
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:54,710
clicking oh god why is it oh thank god

472
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:56,030
oh no oh well he doesn't look too good

473
00:29:54,710 --> 00:30:02,180
for you does he why don't you play

474
00:29:56,030 --> 00:30:03,980
another Drake huh Hitler miss a does he

475
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:06,050
discard does it discard another one

476
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:07,820
please don't please no it didn't it

477
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:13,220
discovered a new lion another one

478
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:15,490
he's digging deep no no Phoenix's oh

479
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:18,590
[Music]

480
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:21,690
another one in hell dude three in a row

481
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:25,250
and never bothered it's okay he got it

482
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:25,250
that was nice I'll give him that

483
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:35,700
we can't actually play our Phoenix

484
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:38,340
that's a little annoying let's go for

485
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:43,950
some life gain I would say we might as

486
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:47,370
well play bow and another legions

487
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:50,670
landing so hopefully we can flip it next

488
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:57,690
turn doesn't matter that much at this

489
00:30:50,670 --> 00:31:01,050
point alright it looks like it's going

490
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:11,240
for another Phoenix or you just want to

491
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:18,600
get better cards alright that's two and

492
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:21,440
that's three yeah I guess he's just

493
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,440
digging at this point

494
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:27,860
I have a feeling he probably just has a

495
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,769
shock or something like that so I'm

496
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:33,649
better off not blocking he could

497
00:31:30,769 --> 00:31:43,059
obviously get a Phoenix out now it's

498
00:31:33,649 --> 00:31:45,879
very likely interesting oh that's

499
00:31:43,059 --> 00:31:50,840
interesting

500
00:31:45,879 --> 00:31:52,399
should I play that now or later I can't

501
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:59,330
play the Phoenix and I think I need to

502
00:31:52,399 --> 00:32:01,250
start dominating a little bit so now the

503
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:04,909
dire fleet tower devil can deal with any

504
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:11,980
Phoenix's if he decides to block we

505
00:32:04,909 --> 00:32:15,220
should still buff the daredevil I think

506
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:19,299
I'm not sure if that's the best move but

507
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:19,299
we're hitting them pretty hard here

508
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:32,630
damn he didn't even block with anything

509
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:35,980
he must okay that makes me a little

510
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:40,220
worried actually we'll see what happens

511
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:46,190
radical idea on my end step interesting

512
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:48,290
he must be digging alright

513
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:50,780
the digging commences he can play a lot

514
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:53,440
of cards here it makes me worried he's

515
00:32:50,780 --> 00:33:05,480
gone through half the deck to phoenixes

516
00:32:53,440 --> 00:33:09,710
there's two more come on this is so

517
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:14,030
anxious come on he's looking a lot of

518
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:17,780
the cards or she there is actually

519
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:21,080
female magic players all four of them

520
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:23,690
all right

521
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:26,380
it doesn't discard a Phoenix keep it

522
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:29,060
that way I like that I like that a lot

523
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:33,320
he has a lot of cards he could keep

524
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:33,920
playing come on Oh he passes two

525
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:40,610
attackers

526
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:45,880
so no Phoenix's what does that mean we

527
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:50,679
win no he's not done

528
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:54,580
now he does that okay surveil to than

529
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:55,600
drawcard why would he do that after

530
00:33:54,580 --> 00:34:00,460
attacking he could have gone into

531
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:08,020
Phoenix what was that a mistake

532
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:10,929
ah that sucks that really sucks we still

533
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:18,190
live lethal ah sucks

534
00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:20,700
ah and here's the shock alright you

535
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:20,700
don't have lethal

536
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:40,240
we lost lethal I repeat we lost but

537
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:42,340
where's my red mana dude alright I think

538
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:44,200
just keeping the pressure on now that

539
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:52,929
he's so low health and we have legions

540
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:54,490
landing is really the way to go but the

541
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:56,169
fact that this brings him down to one is

542
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:59,440
nerve-wracking to say the least

543
00:34:56,169 --> 00:35:04,200
oh that's that Drake you couldn't play

544
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:04,200
so sad for you alright

545
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:16,380
so let's play this and pray to the gods

546
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:24,450
that that's not a draw card spell yeah

547
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:27,920
Oh angry and damn foreigner oh baby bar

548
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:27,920
in a row [ __ ]

549
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:50,230
am i playing against myself it's Mona

550
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:52,150
why we should be okay against this I

551
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:53,680
don't really see this I don't know why

552
00:35:52,150 --> 00:36:00,610
you would play this type of deck in

553
00:35:53,680 --> 00:36:02,680
mythic not to just I think I don't want

554
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:04,360
to play Legion actually so I think he's

555
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:10,690
gonna play at Johnny and I just want to

556
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:14,220
kill a Johnny right away he doesn't play

557
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:14,220
a Johnny I just waste at a time

558
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:26,710
it's actually not that bad because now

559
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:29,560
he's tapped out and we can play leaving

560
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:32,800
more box and he's not gonna he's not

561
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:36,910
gonna take that straight and the more we

562
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:37,750
can build up the Legion the batter why

563
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:40,330
it doesn't right

564
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:42,870
run more boardwax he does have removal

565
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:42,870
though

566
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:58,819
so far yeah it looks bad but I'm really

567
00:36:53,540 --> 00:37:03,920
not worried so we can play titty shaker

568
00:36:58,819 --> 00:37:08,540
and legions landing and then we're going

569
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:11,140
Lyra next turn so the more he can waste

570
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:14,510
his removal is the better we wanted time

571
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:17,140
we want to flip our legion so next turn

572
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:19,970
I'll just walk with titty shaker

573
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:24,890
hopefully he waste his removals he does

574
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:30,230
fine okay I'm not blocking anything this

575
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:31,490
time Oh does that exile oh I didn't know

576
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:36,109
it exile

577
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:37,940
then I will block this turn except I

578
00:37:36,109 --> 00:37:40,750
came all right let's get rid of this

579
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:40,750
it's annoying

580
00:37:47,440 --> 00:38:01,820
I'll save x1 in case he has sac on clay

581
00:37:50,990 --> 00:38:04,030
tribunal but home to I'm sorry I mean

582
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:07,190
why are you playing this garbage tank

583
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:10,520
like why what are you hoping to achieve

584
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:11,360
oh you're not doing anything now that's

585
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:13,670
cute

586
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:19,070
go Lyra go why don't you block with your

587
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:20,630
little birds that BQ I love Lara so much

588
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:22,960
as soon as she enters the board it's

589
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:30,140
like the whole game has changed

590
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:35,390
completely all right let's play this and

591
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:36,860
this and this and see what they play we

592
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:42,950
can justice strike whatever they got

593
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:45,290
anyway easy oh not the bodyguard six

594
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:48,680
hours too late what the hell is the

595
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:50,180
worst why dagger I've seen I guess he

596
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:52,280
was waiting for a Johnny I get it but

597
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:54,800
it's like I have removals for it

598
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:56,600
I want him I hope he's hoping to get it

599
00:38:54,800 --> 00:39:00,470
so that once he finally gets it out I

600
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:02,000
can just go hey he does get or health

601
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:07,220
back each turn though I'll give him that

602
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:12,890
like this is kind of annoying we're both

603
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:14,420
a life gaming back at this point the

604
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:21,110
thing is we are gaining way more health

605
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:23,000
than they are so my god this is so long

606
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:29,170
another bodyguard

607
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:32,500
I guess he's waiting for like a legion

608
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:32,500
whatever they call

609
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:40,800

612
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:52,860
now the game dynamic change for you

613
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:58,440
didn't a lyra has vigilance and dust for

614
00:39:52,860 --> 00:40:06,120

00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:07,980
what why don't you attack me I want it I

616
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:13,100
want him to get a good car just so I can

617
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:16,640
destroy his confidence his emotions I

618
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:19,850
should have flipped the légion there but

619
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:26,160
it's not that important right now

620
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:27,750
never know the creature enters okay you

621
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,580
want to play any more useless cards or

622
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:32,570
are you done with that okay he doesn't

623
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:32,570
attack that's cute

624
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:41,250
do we buff Lyra or a really yeah like we

625
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:45,540
should Aurelia and then try and flip the

626
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:50,790
landing my name trying as 100%

627
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:53,070
completing because then he can him

628
00:40:50,790 --> 00:41:00,270
and then he's forced to sack one of its

629
00:40:53,070 --> 00:41:04,190
creatures you want to block alright I

630
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:04,190
will just concede good game

631
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:31,310
he doesn't give up I mean he's still in

632
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:34,839
there

633
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:34,839
he's got more than half his hell oh

634
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:41,690
that's annoying

635
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:49,930
that's actually really good I might have

636
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:52,849
to binding that he's going all out boys

637
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:57,710
he's going all out so I don't want him

638
00:41:52,849 --> 00:42:09,579
to I'll kill the ones that give him life

639
00:41:57,710 --> 00:42:09,579
what am i doing there you go okay

640
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:45,010
there it is

641
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:48,990
hahaha nice you got it bye that's just

642
00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:51,820
what I wanted to happen I'm so thankful

643
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:54,640
so there you have it everyone angry

644
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:57,250
white Vaman it's a pretty versatile deck

645
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:58,720
dire fleet daredevil I gotta say I love

646
00:42:57,250 --> 00:43:01,330
this card I really should have more of

647
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:04,030
it but a lot of these just go on the

648
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:04,630
principle of two for one so this is two

649
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:07,090
for one

650
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:12,130
this could be a 2 for 1 this is 2 for 1

651
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:12,820
this is 2 for 1 it buffs itself this is

652
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:15,670
2 for 1

653
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:17,230
this is almost always 2 for 1 this is so

654
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:20,230
strong so he's almost always two for one

655
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:22,480
two for one so it's really good against

656
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:25,630
aggro it's just too slow for us for

657
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:27,640
control it always loses almost always

658
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:28,900
unless I have been breakable well yeah

659
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,290
that's it hope you guys enjoyed this

660
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:32,800
video

661
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:37,860
I know not everyone likes magic but it's

662
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:37,860
just one of those days so cry me a river
