the way i really appreciate it um

192
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,680
it's [ __ ] dope isn't it

193
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,480
uh i also so my half bow doesn't look as

194
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,360
good as my long bow because the long bar

195
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,399
has the little

196
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,760
fluffy bit at the end uh i really like

197
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,519
those tangly little

198
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,519
bits at the end of the sword and they're

199
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:06,160
red on top

200
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,279
but i wish the tangly bits were red

201
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,639
because now it looks a bit

202
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,200
scattered you know what i mean kind of

203
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,560
cringe

204
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,519

215
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,519
glad you asked that while i was talking

216
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,200
about armor in a video game

217
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,040
because i don't i don't drink coffee

218
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,000
because i eat

219
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,399
salted caramel porridge in the morning

220
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,560
and

221
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,399
coffee just doesn't go well with it even

222
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,560
though i do like coffee

223
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,399
so i hope we're clear on on this coffee

224
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,200
issue over here

225
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,959
is my consensus is i drink coffee and i

226
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,560
would like to but i do like salted

227
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:03,839
caramel porridge

228
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,519
more than i like so we're clear

229
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,959
are there any confusion if you guys have

230
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,000
questions

231
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:12,399
just like uh hit me up in the dms

232
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,839
actually just ask saib about the coffee

233

and he'll tell you

234
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:20,240
now what's more important about

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,720
my coffee drinking is which sword will

236
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,240

and i'm curious what your thoughts on

768
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:47,920
this is because it bothers me a lot

769
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:51,920
and it's the how long it takes to eat

770
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:53,920
out if you go to a lunch place in uk

771
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,680
or anywhere in europe i would say for

772
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:59,359
that matter

773
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:59,359
you have to wait so long

774
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:02,640
like it almost makes me not want to go

775
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:04,400
out and eat because it do

776
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:07,200
you just have to wait so long whereas in

777
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:10,400
japan i know cringe japan is great

778
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:14,560
and it gets old to hear it but it's so

779
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:14,560
fast it's so fast

780
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:22,319
and you just you just want your food i

781
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:23,680
just want my food i just want my food

782
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:26,559
i don't want to wait for my food i want

783
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:28,240
my food right away i sit down

784
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:30,079
i don't want to wait more than it takes

785
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:32,960
for my chair to cook a meal

786
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:32,960
that's the criteria

787
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:40,480
where the [ __ ] is his mongol armor piece

788
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:44,640
rescue hostages assassinate an enemy

789
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,280
from above

790
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:47,280
i gotta do that

791
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,280
it's just because we went to a sushi

792
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:52,240
place and we were there for i swear

793
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:56,319
almost an

794
00:47:52,240 --> 00:48:00,960
hour and in japan

795
00:47:56,319 --> 00:48:04,000
i mean it's uncomparable this service

796
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:05,040
incomparable whatever the english is not

797
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
to mention the fact that you don't have

798
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:08,319
to wait so long

799
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:11,040
i don't i don't understand why why does

800
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:11,040
it take so long

801
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:20,800
did he hurt him

802
00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:49,839
out

803
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:58,079
we got any cool pictures from us i feel

804
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:59,520
like i saw manny but i was too late to

805
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:01,680
all right let me see what you guys

806
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:05,040
thought about it

807
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:05,040
so she's worth the wait here

808
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:12,880
chick-fil-a's got his son well that's a

809
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:15,280
franchise i'm just mentioning like

810
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:19,280
any restaurant you go to the uk you

811
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:19,280
still have to wait a pretty long time

812
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:28,240
the food is good so it's worth it so we

813
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,240
still go but

814
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:34,480
it seems like i was like okay why don't

815
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:34,480
why don't someone create a restaurant

816
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:40,000
um with the same principle here in uk

817
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:41,920
but it seems like people just don't mind

818
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,440
waiting like they go out to eat to just

819
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:46,000
sit down and

820
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:47,200
that's part of it simp grind is still

821
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:59,839
going have a good

822
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:59,839
thank you tony appreciate it

823
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,960
i sound like a karen why because i want

824
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,960
my food fast

825
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:13,839
like every person ever

826
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:27,839
hey look at leg though god damn that's

827
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:27,839
some photo mode moment right there

828
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:37,359
i cannot find this [ __ ] mongol [ __ ]

829
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,040
maybe it comes from the oh it comes from

830
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:43,760
the leader once we're done with this

831
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,760
quest isn't it

832
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,599
thoughts on slow walking person their

833
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:55,760
worst

834
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:58,319
they're the worst they're the worst

835
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:58,319
thing worse

836
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:08,559
slopes slow-moving people i can get

837
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:11,280
around slow-moving people at airports

838
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:13,599
needs to be uh escorted out like they

839
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:16,160
need to be treated like terrorists

840
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:17,599
because they are and i'm tired of

841
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:22,079
pretending that they're not where is

842
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:25,280
this guy

843
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:25,280
oh nice

844
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:29,359
you're in an airport you can't walk slow

845
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:32,400
you have to go to the side otherwise

846
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:34,880
i know the rules be conscious around the

847
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:36,800
people around you

848
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:40,240
there are more people in the world

849
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,240
you're a terrorist get away

850
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:52,640
worse i'm so glad you brought that up

851
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,680
if you're a slow-moving people person at

852
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:56,000
an airport

853
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:58,240
i don't care how good of a person you

854
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,400
are or how big of a fan

855
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:02,720
you will be treated like terrorists that

856
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:05,599
you are

857
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:05,599
mental terrorists

858
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:13,760
the escalator stand on side thing is a

859
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,440
bit controversial though

860
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,800
now that's really interesting because if

861
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:18,079
everyone just

862
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,839
stood next to each other at the

863
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:21,520
escalator it would actually go quicker

864
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:26,160
as opposed to

865
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:26,160
uh have the people standing on the side

866
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,599
so in some ways i find it a bit annoying

867
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,640
this rule that you have to stand on the

868
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:34,800
side

869
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:36,240
especially when it's really busy because

870
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,599
it would actually go quicker if everyone

871
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:41,040
just stood next to each other

872
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:41,040
because there's more space being filled

873
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:46,640
but i digress whatever it's called

874
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:50,079
english i don't speak it

875
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:50,079
alright we got another piece sweet

876
00:52:53,760 --> 00:53:00,079
ew who even goes into public yeah

877
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:01,359
i know that's not a carrot you guys

878
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:03,040
don't know what a cairn is if you think

879
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:15,839

880
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:15,839
you guys are cringed now i cringe in you

881
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:24,720

here

883
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:32,319
that's so far

884
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:32,319
noise

885
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,559
anyone i don't agree with is a karen

886
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:38,559

888
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:45,040

chad chad society mean that's what that

895
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:13,359

though

905
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:36,880
uh this is if i'm a dictator basically

906
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:39,520

00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:13,119
yeah i'm making this up as i go but i

914
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,920
actually it actually makes a lot of

915
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:16,400
sense now that

916
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:21,520
it's coming out of my mouth i actually

917
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:24,960
oh i got the armor hey

918
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:26,799
just a wee bit i don't like it that much

919
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:28,079
maybe if we change color on it i'll go

920
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:31,520
to the

921
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:31,520
uh black color merchants

922
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:37,920
what else annoys me um

923
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:39,599
bad design yeah bad design in general

924
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:40,880
really pisses me off i talked about this

925
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:44,160
many times before

926
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:45,520
but yeah designers that uh either focus

927
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:47,839
too much on design

928
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:48,559
and too little on utility or too much on

929
00:55:47,839 --> 00:55:51,040
utility

930
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:54,319
and totally a little on design uh

931
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:54,319
ppsnipped it's gone

932
00:55:54,960 --> 00:56:01,839
we're an aesthetic based society we

933
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:03,520
value art

934
00:56:01,839 --> 00:56:05,119
not art because artists cringe obviously

935
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:07,920
but aesthetic looking

936
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:09,520
uh things i would i don't know how to

937
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:10,319
phrase that really but you know what i

938
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:12,640
mean

939
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:12,640
uh

940
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:19,839
yeah let's try the white dye first

941
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:20,720
like people dressed really ugly yeah

942
00:56:19,839 --> 00:56:30,880
people get snipped

943
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:32,559
if you dress bad is that you're done

944
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:34,079
it's more about how you interact with

945
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:34,480
the world that's why art is cringe

946
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:37,599
because

947
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:37,599
art doesn't help the world

948
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:43,760
so you want to slowly castrate people to

949
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:45,119
keep them in line

950
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:47,839
yeah what do we do with about the women

951
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:51,119
i never thought about this

952
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:51,119
i didn't really

953
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:59,839
oh come on they don't give you an armor

954
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:59,839
die for

955
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,880
for this one seriously

956
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:13,680
what about the black armor i think it's

957
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:27,839
here somewhere

958
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:27,839
you're an artist for a living

959
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:37,119
so you can't dye this armor

960
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:37,119
i hate it it's so ugly yeah i mean

961
00:57:38,839 --> 00:57:41,839
oh

962
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:55,839
should i buy this while i'm here

963
00:57:56,559 --> 00:58:00,559
that was cool too if i get a good hat to

964
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:00,559
it

965
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:06,880
that looks pretty good too but i don't

966
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:06,880
want it

967
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:20,839
uh what in the world did you just try

968
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:23,839
and say captain because i can't read

969
00:58:20,839 --> 00:58:23,839
that

970
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:37,839
even that looks cool

971
00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:46,559
okay let's upgrade the armor then i've

972
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:48,839
been saving it for a long time

973
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:50,240
so i should have a lot of upgrades

974
00:58:48,839 --> 00:58:53,760
available

975
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:53,760

977
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:00,319
utopia that i

978
00:58:57,839 --> 00:59:00,319
created

979
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:07,200
loud noises in general so that's a

980
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:10,079
boomer

981
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:11,119
yeah you're not allowed to have certain

982
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:15,920
decibels

983
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:15,920
over different things right

984
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:23,200
uh motorcycles you get the full

985
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:23,200
castration

986
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:33,839
what the [ __ ] is that mask

987
00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:47,839

992
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:18,880
health reduces all damage by major

993
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:20,640
amount disguises you while out of combat

994
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:21,119
massively reducing mongol detection

995
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:24,559
speed

996
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:24,559

01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:45,440
what's happening

1122
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:50,960
without the ghost armor dun

1123
01:12:57,679 --> 01:13:01,360
i'm actually i'm actually i won't say

1124
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:02,800
i'm happy

1125
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:03,920
jurgen died but i'm happy i have the

1126
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:05,120
white horse because i actually wanted

1127
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:06,960
the white horse

1128
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:10,159
to match me so i'm it's not it's not

1129
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:12,719
that i'm happy it's more like

1130
01:13:10,159 --> 01:13:14,000
uh conflicting emotions jurgen number

1131
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:15,760
six is uh

1132
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:17,120
i'm happy with the argument number six

1133
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:20,080
but i'm still sad

1134
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:20,560
that yoga number five died stealth zero

1135
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:23,600
shut up

1136
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:23,600
you haven't even started yet

1137
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:32,960
okay where do i go

1138
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:36,000
what the [ __ ] what the [ __ ] dude

1139
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:36,000
can i oh i can jump okay

1140
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:40,560
oh close

1141
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:43,760
uh will i do more collabs with

1142
01:13:42,239 --> 01:13:45,440
jacksepticeye well i

1143
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:47,199
am jacksepticeye so that'd be kind of

1144
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:48,960
cringe if i didn't

1145
01:13:47,199 --> 01:13:50,640
have you ever seen us in the same room

1146
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:53,120
together i don't think so

1147
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:55,280
hope that answers your question bro all

1148
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:55,280
right

1149
01:13:56,960 --> 01:14:00,239
it's good i'm wearing the white armor

1150
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:02,080
it's like extra stealth if you wear

1151
01:14:00,239 --> 01:14:04,400
white because you can't see white in the

1152
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:04,400
dark

1153
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:14,320
if i attack the guards it will chrome a

1154
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:16,239
monster they think i am not

1155
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:17,679
all right i guess i can't kill them that

1156
01:14:16,239 --> 01:14:19,360
means i can't use the wind charm either

1157
01:14:17,679 --> 01:14:20,960
there because they have a poison on them

1158
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:21,760
because i upgraded them new technique

1159
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:25,040
available

1160
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:25,040
all right all right all right

1161
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:31,760
have i finally done it no we have these

1162
01:14:29,199 --> 01:14:35,120
i didn't see them

1163
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:35,120
otherwise we're almost maxed out

1164
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:38,800
see i wish i could just have it selected

1165
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:43,840
right

1166
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:43,840
you can make a quick change

1167
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:49,600
it's a bit of a flaw in the game to be

1168
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:49,600
honest

1169
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:53,120
because now i have to change these as

1170
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:53,120
well

1171
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:57,840
oh wait i don't have to have that

1172
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:25,840
oh my god we're sort of the stealth ones

1173
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:39,840
i don't know

1174
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:53,840
where are they there

1175
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:53,840
my god

1176
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:10,080
there we go he's ready

1177
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:12,800
what does one have to do to become a

1178
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:15,840
moderator nothing

1179
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:15,840

1181
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:26,640
all right this is very easy so far not

1182
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:26,640
gonna lie kind of cringe

1183
01:16:27,679 --> 01:16:31,600
obviously they want us to swim at this

1184
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:31,600
part

1185
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:37,040

1186
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:40,080

1187
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:42,640

1193
01:17:08,239 --> 01:17:11,520

1194
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:20,159
that way yes

1195
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:22,400

1196
01:17:20,159 --> 01:17:22,400
there

1197
01:17:23,199 --> 01:17:31,840
i don't know

1198
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:48,480

01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:47,679
yeah i would love to play dark souls i

1210
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:55,840

1211
01:18:47,679 --> 01:18:55,840
[ __ ] that up

1212
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:11,840
don't fall down the waterfall

1213
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:14,320
i just got platinum on this game 20

1214
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:14,320
minutes ago

1215
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:21,199
hell yeah i don't know what that means i

1216
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:25,760
think i was supposed to jump here

1217
01:19:21,199 --> 01:19:25,760
i have this i have this thought

1218
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:31,280
nice

1219
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:37,440
so we're literally going the same way as

1220
01:19:34,159 --> 01:19:40,159
last time this is so easy

1221
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:41,120
we got smoking sarah that's so far feels

1222
01:19:40,159 --> 01:19:42,719
good as well

1223
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:44,080
i don't mean to rub it in that but you

1224
01:19:42,719 --> 01:19:46,159
guys are probably not very good at video

1225
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:47,600
games

1226
01:19:46,159 --> 01:19:50,480
i don't want to make you guys feel bad

1227
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:54,000
or anything but uh i'm probably

1228
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:55,679
a little better than you man

1229
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,920
i i would probably cringe really hard if

1230
01:19:55,679 --> 01:19:59,760
i watched you guys play a video game

1231
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:01,040
it would be tough for me to backseat

1232
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:02,840
game because uh

1233
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:05,120
i would just feel bad the whole way

1234
01:20:02,840 --> 01:20:07,600
through

1235
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:08,239
i'm being you yeah you see how annoying

1236
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:11,040
that is

1237
01:20:08,239 --> 01:20:11,040
you understand now

1238
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:19,040
okay where

1239
01:20:30,719 --> 01:20:36,000
all right should i go in here you can't

1240
01:20:33,199 --> 01:20:39,440
see me he can't see me i might miss him

1241
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:39,440
i'm a shadow in the night

1242
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:50,800
i am a shadow in the night

1243
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:53,040
and night oh yeah we already stopped

1244
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:56,719
here i forgot about it

1245
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:56,719
where's the ladders around the corners

1246
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:59,520
you think they up their security after

1247
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:00,960
what happened last time you know what i

1248
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:02,960
mean

1249
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:04,639
because you're a huge inspiration so i

1250
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:09,679
made my own jaws cars

1251
01:21:04,639 --> 01:21:09,679
hopefully oh cool hell yeah

1252
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:15,840
dope

1253
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:29,840
all right we gotta get in his private

1254
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:29,840
quarters this time

1255
01:21:30,159 --> 01:21:33,840
oh man we're going in there that's kind

1256
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:33,840
of cool

1257
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:37,199
this could actually be fun how about

1258
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:38,639
that

1259
01:21:37,199 --> 01:21:43,840
okay so they fixed a lot of their

1260
01:21:38,639 --> 01:21:43,840
security flaws from last time huh

1261
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:57,760
yes we have to prove

1262
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:59,679
we fight with honor

1263
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:01,920

01:40:12,159 --> 01:40:16,639
is a butt man and they're about to get

1489
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:17,600
expelled so he has to prove that he's a

1490
01:40:16,639 --> 01:40:19,679
butt man

1491
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:22,719
because any butt man the man that likes

1492
01:40:19,679 --> 01:40:26,080
butts can't be bad

1493
01:40:22,719 --> 01:40:28,639
so he goes through this epic rant it's

1494
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:28,639
so funny

1495
01:40:29,679 --> 01:40:33,280
why butts are better because of

1496
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:35,600
evolution

1497
01:40:33,280 --> 01:40:36,800
because we used to walk on four legs so

1498
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:39,679
we would look up on

1499
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:41,920
butts they are the source of everything

1500
01:40:39,679 --> 01:40:41,920
good

1501
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:50,239
it's so funny and it gets so worked up

1502
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:50,560
talking about why butts are superior

1503
01:40:50,239 --> 01:40:52,400
that

1504
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:54,800
the principal just starts hugging him

1505
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:54,800
it's okay

1506
01:40:55,679 --> 01:41:00,560
i used that scene to convince my wife to

1507
01:40:57,920 --> 01:41:05,840
watch it wow

1508
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:05,840
all right here we go epic video games

1509
01:41:06,480 --> 01:41:12,719
this should be epic this is the end so

1510
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:12,719
let's get into this [ __ ]

1511
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,239
whoa

1512
01:41:17,360 --> 01:41:20,159
well i [ __ ] up

1513
01:41:30,239 --> 01:41:33,840

1514
01:41:55,280 --> 01:42:01,840
damn she's a badass

1515
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:01,840
i was trying to be moonstone

1516
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:17,840
general

1517
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:17,840
why won't you die

1518
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:29,840
oh this is cool we're all going together

1519
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:29,840
i like that

1520
01:42:46,159 --> 01:42:48,719
nice

1521
01:42:54,840 --> 01:42:57,840
nice

1522
01:43:00,239 --> 01:43:11,840
okay where are they

1523
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:30,320
nice

1524
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:53,840
oh

1525
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:53,840
i can never learn

1526
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:07,840
not ishikawa

1527
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:17,199
gotta have my bro bro get up bro stop

1528
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:17,199
sleeping

1529
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:25,600
he said manga that's so cool

1530
01:44:21,600 --> 01:44:25,600
yes oh that was cool [ __ ] i should

1531
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:35,840
nice

1532
01:44:45,440 --> 01:44:49,840
i hope there's more fighting [ __ ] yeah

1533
01:44:47,119 --> 01:44:49,840
this is so epic

1534
01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:55,679
hey games what are they doing what are

1535
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:55,679
they doing

1536
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:02,960
that's right we are saved

1537
01:45:28,080 --> 01:45:33,119
even though i would probably puke the

1538
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:33,119
[ __ ] out all over it

1539
01:45:33,679 --> 01:45:38,320
i don't know samurai

1540
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:41,520
it is not the way

1541
01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:50,800
oh god it's one of these [ __ ] all right

1542
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:50,800
i guess i don't go

1543
01:45:53,760 --> 01:46:00,159
where the [ __ ] am i going

1544
01:45:56,800 --> 01:46:02,320
i know my body is nowhere

1545
01:46:00,159 --> 01:46:04,800
that almost ended in a cringe here we go

1546
01:46:02,320 --> 01:46:04,800
this way

1547
01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:13,840
sarah that's gotta keep it gotta keep it

1548
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:13,840
so far

1549
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:27,840
you know what's really tempting to use

1550
01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:27,840
here

1551
01:46:31,199 --> 01:46:33,600
these

1552
01:46:37,360 --> 01:46:40,880
i think i'm not supposed to fight right

1553
01:46:38,639 --> 01:46:43,520
now i'm just supposed to

1554
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:43,520
go up high

1555
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:49,679
thank you ray ray breathing is something

1556
01:46:48,159 --> 01:46:51,360
i never actually thought about that but

1557
01:46:49,679 --> 01:46:52,880
yeah needing oxygen

1558
01:46:51,360 --> 01:46:55,199
you're technically in need of someone

1559
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:56,639
else when real chads are completely

1560
01:46:55,199 --> 01:46:58,719
independent

1561
01:46:56,639 --> 01:47:00,960
so i have to agree with you on that one

1562
01:46:58,719 --> 01:47:00,960
chief

1563
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:08,639
uh is this not high enough i need to go

1564
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:10,000
higher

1565
01:47:08,639 --> 01:47:23,840
can i fight my way there because that's

1566
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:23,840
more fun

1567
01:47:34,840 --> 01:47:37,840
dammit

1568
01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:58,000

oh i've always wanted to get that one

1573
01:48:38,719 --> 01:49:00,800
it's not a cool background

1574
01:48:46,560 --> 01:49:03,280
maybe we changed

1575
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:05,600
it's a bad angle i should get it another

1576
01:49:03,280 --> 01:49:05,600

here we go oh

1935
02:31:51,520 --> 02:31:57,840
the pressure playing on hard mode is

1936
02:31:54,840 --> 02:31:57,840
difficult

1937
02:32:05,680 --> 02:32:14,720
can you imagine the tension

1938
02:32:11,200 --> 02:32:14,720
how you almost feel in your gut

1939
02:32:16,640 --> 02:32:25,840
having to fight against someone like you

1940
02:32:19,359 --> 02:32:25,840
don't want to

1941
02:32:36,840 --> 02:32:39,840

1942
02:32:42,399 --> 02:32:47,040

02:32:47,040 --> 02:32:50,160
and then i can loop that and have as a

1945
02:32:48,399 --> 02:32:53,280
background

1949
02:32:56,399 --> 02:32:59,280
wallpaper yes

02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:21,840

that

1961
02:34:42,840 --> 02:34:45,840

oh wait i get to do the fight

1966
02:35:27,680 --> 02:35:31,359
what you don't understand is i'm too

1967
02:35:29,040 --> 02:35:31,359
strong

1968
02:35:35,760 --> 02:35:41,840
i studied the blade with you son

1969
02:35:57,200 --> 02:36:01,439
what the [ __ ] i blocked all of those

1970
02:36:05,680 --> 02:36:08,720
what happened there all right guess this

1971
02:36:08,399 --> 02:36:10,319
will

1972
02:36:08,720 --> 02:36:22,800
take a little while i would be cool to

1973
02:36:10,319 --> 02:36:37,840
do it on the first try

1974
02:36:22,800 --> 02:36:37,840
there it is

1975
02:36:50,399 --> 02:37:05,840
there it is

1976
02:37:11,520 --> 02:37:19,840
i try to do that

1977
02:37:30,840 --> 02:37:47,840
um

1978
02:37:32,319 --> 02:37:47,840
oh come on yes

1979
02:37:58,840 --> 02:38:05,040
uh

1980
02:38:01,600 --> 02:38:05,040
you were like a father to me

1981
02:38:13,280 --> 02:38:16,319
the warrior's death

1982
02:38:16,479 --> 02:38:23,680
more your staff obviously

1983
02:38:20,560 --> 02:38:26,080
always that would just you that would

1984
02:38:23,680 --> 02:38:30,720
disgrace him so badly otherwise

1985
02:38:26,080 --> 02:38:30,720
to let him live is to die anyway

1986
02:38:33,680 --> 02:38:44,479
he's okay

1987
02:38:43,200 --> 02:38:46,399
it looks like i picked the choice that

1988
02:38:44,479 --> 02:38:49,120
no one wants you guys don't you guys

1989
02:38:46,399 --> 02:38:49,120
don't understand

1990
02:38:54,399 --> 02:38:57,840
my tails

1991
02:39:22,840 --> 02:39:25,840
damn

1992
02:39:38,479 --> 02:39:43,520
he was all about honor it was all his

1993
02:39:41,280 --> 02:39:46,640
whole character was about it

1994
02:39:43,520 --> 02:39:46,640
it totally fit

1995
02:39:48,640 --> 02:39:52,880
i didn't understand why that was even a

1996
02:39:50,840 --> 02:39:55,040
choice

1997
02:39:52,880 --> 02:39:57,120
and it was also his way to finally obey

1998
02:39:55,040 --> 02:39:59,040
honor which is what he wanted his son to

1999
02:39:57,120 --> 02:40:01,920
do anyway i know he wasn't his son

2000
02:39:59,040 --> 02:40:04,720
so he makes sense it's a sweet ending if

2001
02:40:01,920 --> 02:40:07,840
you think about it

2002
02:40:04,720 --> 02:40:07,840
sucker punch well done

2003
02:40:12,319 --> 02:40:21,840
i would not spare him if i played it ten

2004
02:40:14,720 --> 02:40:21,840
times more

2005
02:40:27,279 --> 02:40:35,840
that was the good ending i'm serious

2006
02:40:40,319 --> 02:40:44,319
beautiful i actually really really like

2007
02:40:42,240 --> 02:40:45,760
that ending a lie

2008
02:40:44,319 --> 02:40:47,520
even though i i wasn't on board with

2009
02:40:45,760 --> 02:40:51,200
this story a lot of times

2010
02:40:47,520 --> 02:40:52,640
that was an incredible ending so good

2011
02:40:51,200 --> 02:40:54,880
i love that i wish there was more of

2012
02:40:52,640 --> 02:40:54,880
that

2013
02:40:55,680 --> 02:40:59,520
you made the right choice especially in

2014
02:40:56,880 --> 02:41:03,840
their culture right yeah

2015
02:40:59,520 --> 02:41:03,840
totally fit

2016
02:41:03,920 --> 02:41:08,319
i don't doubt a second it's noisy great

2017
02:41:06,240 --> 02:41:09,680
game that's so much fun

2018
02:41:08,319 --> 02:41:11,760
i'm actually going to keep playing it

2019
02:41:09,680 --> 02:41:12,960
because i want to get all the

2020
02:41:11,760 --> 02:41:16,160
unlockables and [ __ ]

2021
02:41:12,960 --> 02:41:17,920
i'll probably 100 it just because i

2022
02:41:16,160 --> 02:41:20,319
think it's so pretty and i just enjoy

2023
02:41:17,920 --> 02:41:21,200
playing it i've been playing a ton of it

2024
02:41:20,319 --> 02:41:22,880
on my own

2025
02:41:21,200 --> 02:41:24,720
doing side quests and just looking at

2026
02:41:22,880 --> 02:41:26,800
shrines and [ __ ] it's so fun

2027
02:41:24,720 --> 02:41:29,279
it's a long time ago since i enjoyed a

2028
02:41:26,800 --> 02:41:32,880
game like that

2029
02:41:29,279 --> 02:41:34,399
uh i loved it i could could it

2030
02:41:32,880 --> 02:41:36,000
definitely could have been better uh

2031
02:41:34,399 --> 02:41:37,279
there's a lot of things to improve but i

2032
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:39,840
that makes me excited if they do a

2033
02:41:37,279 --> 02:41:39,840
sequel like

2034
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:42,479
so cool

2035
02:41:43,120 --> 02:41:46,880
i'll probably give an eight and a half

2036
02:41:45,040 --> 02:41:51,040
almost a nine

2037
02:41:46,880 --> 02:41:51,040
very close to a nine eight point nine

2038
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:59,120
it goes eight out of ten but game of the

2039
02:41:55,760 --> 02:41:59,120
year anyway yeah i can see that

2040
02:42:05,200 --> 02:42:10,840
you get a better house if you spare him

2041
02:42:06,960 --> 02:42:13,840
yeah well you get a worse ending if you

2042
02:42:10,840 --> 02:42:13,840
spam

2043
02:42:15,279 --> 02:42:19,600

2047
02:42:25,040 --> 02:42:27,840
the roots

2048
02:42:28,319 --> 02:42:31,439
the way i saw it killing him was a

2049
02:42:29,680 --> 02:42:33,600
contradiction to dean's character

2050
02:42:31,439 --> 02:42:35,439
yeah i i thought about that too but i

2051
02:42:33,600 --> 02:42:37,760
saw it as he's doing what

2052
02:42:35,439 --> 02:42:40,000
his uncle wanted him to do all along

2053
02:42:37,760 --> 02:42:43,439
he's fulfilling that wish

2054
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:43,439
when one of them have to die

2055
02:42:43,600 --> 02:42:47,760
he's going with what he wanted all along

2056
02:42:45,920 --> 02:42:49,439
which is to follow the way of honor

2057
02:42:47,760 --> 02:42:51,279
even if it wasn't a samurai anymore it

2058
02:42:49,439 --> 02:42:54,560
was a one last

2059
02:42:51,279 --> 02:42:55,920
decision to do it for him which is a

2060
02:42:54,560 --> 02:42:58,319
tough decision to make

2061
02:42:55,920 --> 02:43:00,000
but it's the one he wanted so i think it

2062
02:42:58,319 --> 02:43:03,439
was a

2063
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:03,439
beautiful ending that's great

2064
02:43:04,240 --> 02:43:09,840
there's another scene after the credits

2065
02:43:06,240 --> 02:43:09,840
i'll wait

2066
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:36,720
if you replay in slow-mo you can catch

2067
02:43:25,840 --> 02:43:38,640
us we've gassing shut up

2068
02:43:36,720 --> 02:43:40,720
i'm not like ellie all right i'm not

2069
02:43:38,640 --> 02:43:51,840
just gonna let him go in the end

2070
02:43:40,720 --> 02:43:51,840
all right

2071
02:43:57,600 --> 02:44:01,760
well done i don't know how they made a

2072
02:44:00,319 --> 02:44:03,680
game so pretty

2073
02:44:01,760 --> 02:44:05,359
i don't know how they did it it's so

2074
02:44:03,680 --> 02:44:07,840
good

2075
02:44:05,359 --> 02:44:09,760
it's crazy how just a game looking nice

2076
02:44:07,840 --> 02:44:11,359
makes you want to play it i've never

2077
02:44:09,760 --> 02:44:13,520
i mean obviously there's a ton of pretty

2078
02:44:11,359 --> 02:44:16,080
game that i liked playing but

2079
02:44:13,520 --> 02:44:17,040
just graphically it it was a while ago

2080
02:44:16,080 --> 02:44:18,960
you're like whoa

2081
02:44:17,040 --> 02:44:21,040
i love this i want to be part of this

2082
02:44:18,960 --> 02:44:23,040
world i don't even care if it's just

2083
02:44:21,040 --> 02:44:25,120
running around doing [ __ ] i'll actually

2084
02:44:23,040 --> 02:44:27,200
really like that

2085
02:44:25,120 --> 02:44:28,479
thank you name i'm glad you agreed we

2086
02:44:27,200 --> 02:44:29,359
don't always have to agree on the

2087
02:44:28,479 --> 02:44:33,840
choices but

2088
02:44:29,359 --> 02:44:33,840
i feel strong about it what i did

2089
02:44:35,920 --> 02:44:38,960
and i know i mean last of us last of us

2090
02:44:38,080 --> 02:44:40,960
yeah uh

2091
02:44:38,960 --> 02:44:42,560
if i if someone asked me like which game

2092
02:44:40,960 --> 02:44:43,279
do you recommend this one or the last of

2093
02:44:42,560 --> 02:44:46,080
us um

2094
02:44:43,279 --> 02:44:48,160
there's no doubt this is a game you can

2095
02:44:46,080 --> 02:44:50,880
have so much more fun with

2096
02:44:48,160 --> 02:44:53,040
last it was just dreary and annoying

2097
02:44:50,880 --> 02:44:56,000
like comparing it to this my god

2098
02:44:53,040 --> 02:44:57,920
why was it so like uh maybe last of us

2099
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:59,040
came out in a bad timing or something

2100
02:44:57,920 --> 02:45:02,720
that man

2101
02:44:59,040 --> 02:45:02,720
looking back at that just gives me like

2102
02:45:07,920 --> 02:45:17,279
makes me angry makes me sad

2103
02:45:14,240 --> 02:45:17,279
it's too much man

2104
02:45:23,760 --> 02:45:27,439
not much of a gamer and i completely

2105
02:45:25,600 --> 02:45:28,080
skipped this generation of consoles but

2106
02:45:27,439 --> 02:45:29,439
this place

2107
02:45:28,080 --> 02:45:31,359
was truly a pleasure to watch thank you

2108
02:45:29,439 --> 02:45:33,920
so much gt i'm glad you enjoyed it

2109
02:45:31,359 --> 02:45:33,920
that's great

2110
02:45:35,520 --> 02:45:38,080
props to

2111
02:45:39,040 --> 02:45:43,520
naughty dog for making a bad game so we

2112
02:45:41,279 --> 02:45:46,560
could make i'm just kidding i'm joking

2113
02:45:43,520 --> 02:45:48,080
that's rude last of us wasn't two wasn't

2114
02:45:46,560 --> 02:45:57,840
bad it was just wasn't the game

2115
02:45:48,080 --> 02:45:57,840
anyone wanted

2116
02:46:03,359 --> 02:46:06,240
what's next

2117
02:46:07,840 --> 02:46:13,040
i want to play dark souls or sakura

2118
02:46:11,359 --> 02:46:15,279
or maybe even god of war since i never

2119
02:46:13,040 --> 02:46:25,840
actually finished it but

2120
02:46:15,279 --> 02:46:25,840
we'll see

2121
02:46:26,399 --> 02:46:31,840
dark souls 3 in case i didn't say that

2122
02:46:29,760 --> 02:46:39,840
i might do a poll and we'll see which

2123
02:46:31,840 --> 02:46:39,840
one of those three gets more votes

2124
02:46:49,840 --> 02:46:56,720
yeah i remember when i started playing

2125
02:46:52,800 --> 02:46:58,800
god of war i was so excited to play it

2126
02:46:56,720 --> 02:47:00,319
i don't know why i was so like i guess i

2127
02:46:58,800 --> 02:47:02,399
was really busy at the time i was

2128
02:47:00,319 --> 02:47:03,520
in japan at the time it just didn't feel

2129
02:47:02,399 --> 02:47:06,800
right for me to start a

2130
02:47:03,520 --> 02:47:08,000
let's play i like the soundtrack it's

2131
02:47:06,800 --> 02:47:11,120
nice

2132
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:14,240
now if i can stream it it's more fun

2133
02:47:11,120 --> 02:47:16,240
to share i enjoy this so much more

2134
02:47:14,240 --> 02:47:21,840
personally i enjoy playing games like

2135
02:47:16,240 --> 02:47:21,840
this more as a let's play formula

2136
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:29,040
your playthrough games were equally epic

2137
02:47:28,080 --> 02:47:30,640
hell yeah

2138
02:47:29,040 --> 02:47:32,399
it was fun to play last of us i had some

2139
02:47:30,640 --> 02:47:34,240
great moments

2140
02:47:32,399 --> 02:47:36,640
i think last of us probably wins in a

2141
02:47:34,240 --> 02:47:39,680
lot a lot of the details

2142
02:47:36,640 --> 02:47:41,840
of the design of the graphics

2143
02:47:39,680 --> 02:47:43,680
like fingers and that kind of stuff look

2144
02:47:41,840 --> 02:47:45,439
way more like

2145
02:47:43,680 --> 02:47:49,840
that's kind of stuff i kind of miss on

2146
02:47:45,439 --> 02:47:49,840
this i want the fingers guys

2147
02:47:54,640 --> 02:47:58,399

02:47:56,880 --> 02:47:59,680
add that to the list

2149
02:47:58,399 --> 02:48:04,240

2244
02:56:59,840 --> 02:57:02,479
ghost sense

2245
02:57:02,560 --> 02:57:09,840
what sorry doggie

2246
02:57:18,080 --> 02:57:21,120
if there's norse mythology in god of war

2247
02:57:20,000 --> 02:57:25,359
that might be really fun

2248
02:57:21,120 --> 02:57:28,560
too i read a little bit about it it is

2249
02:57:25,359 --> 02:57:32,720
interesting there are some really good

2250
02:57:28,560 --> 02:57:32,720
philosophy from the time as well

2251
02:57:34,000 --> 02:57:39,279
we weren't all booga booga back then you

2252
02:57:36,640 --> 02:57:39,279
know what i'm saying

2253
02:57:44,240 --> 02:57:51,840
is this liberated boosh

2254
02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:51,840
next one

2255
02:57:52,960 --> 02:57:58,399
that's the god of war is all about cool

2256
02:57:56,640 --> 02:57:59,760
i have it literally ready i could start

2257
02:57:58,399 --> 02:58:05,840
it now

2258
02:57:59,760 --> 02:58:05,840
i think i have it i'm not sure though

2259
02:58:12,240 --> 02:58:19,840
oh god i forgot our useless you can

2260
02:58:14,399 --> 02:58:19,840
smear guinness

2261
02:58:30,840 --> 02:58:33,840
uh

2262
02:58:38,399 --> 02:58:44,640
i i would start it now but it makes it

2263
02:58:41,120 --> 02:58:44,640
confusing because um

2264
02:58:44,720 --> 02:58:48,640
the the parts of the videos like this

2265
02:58:46,800 --> 02:58:50,720
will be the end of ghost of tsushima and

2266
02:58:48,640 --> 02:58:52,240
the beginning of god of war if i do that

2267
02:58:50,720 --> 02:59:00,319
that that's just very confusing for

2268
02:58:52,240 --> 02:59:02,399
people to find it i think

2269
02:59:00,319 --> 02:59:03,680
you get a light lion cloth armor if you

2270
02:59:02,399 --> 02:59:05,760
get all the hot springs here

2271
02:59:03,680 --> 02:59:08,399
what is that because i have uh i think i

2272
02:59:05,760 --> 02:59:11,920
almost have all the hot springs

2273
02:59:08,399 --> 02:59:14,080
uh two more should i do that is that

2274
02:59:11,920 --> 02:59:29,840
worth it

2275
02:59:14,080 --> 02:59:29,840
ain't got time for your sims

2276
02:59:33,520 --> 02:59:43,840
kill an enemy with a smoke bomb

2277
02:59:37,359 --> 02:59:43,840
that's a sticky bomb

2278
02:59:54,840 --> 02:59:57,840

03:00:01,200 --> 03:00:11,840

feelings for way you didn't kill your

2397
03:10:25,439 --> 03:10:28,399
uncle you would have gotten the red

2398
03:10:27,040 --> 03:10:31,520
variation

2399
03:10:28,399 --> 03:10:34,720

2403
03:10:38,840 --> 03:10:41,840

it's only fair that i'm naked too

2406
03:11:05,359 --> 03:11:09,840
this is the best armor of the game

2407
03:11:11,920 --> 03:11:15,200
i said it before i was playing around

2408
03:11:13,439 --> 03:11:17,359
with my head i'm like it would be cool

2409
03:11:15,200 --> 03:11:20,319
if this game had online multiplayer

2410
03:11:17,359 --> 03:11:22,000
and focus more on the duels because the

2411
03:11:20,319 --> 03:11:26,000
parts that i enjoyed the most

2412
03:11:22,000 --> 03:11:26,000
