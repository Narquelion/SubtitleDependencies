subreddit without watching the latest

00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,360
video

167
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,360
i'm always so confused fake fan didn't

168
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,160
watch the latest video fake fan

169
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,680
you see you need an extremely high iq to

170
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,800
understand pewdiepie

171
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,800
okay the lore goes extremely in depth

172
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,240
her he's probably thinking about other

173
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,000
villagers him

174
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,520
what if pewdiepie actually got the job

175
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,360
he applied for at mojang

176
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,280
and the job was to become a youtuber

177
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,919
again and gain a large

178
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,840
enough platform to revive the game after

179
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,080
it initially lost popularity

180
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:53,280
oh my god can you imagine how much

181
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,960
minecraft gained from not hiring me

182
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,280
because instead i just went and became a

183
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,680
youtuber and helped promote the game

184
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,520
the cape you saw on minecraft character

185
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,400
is not because of your resource pack

186
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,400

440
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,799
but we had some dope adventures we

441
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,120
crossed the land and see

442
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:45,039
in every kind of weather sometimes i

443
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,200
would get lost i can get a bit

444
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:49,360
distracted but i always knew you'd find

445
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,919
me so it never really mattered

446
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,160
my stable was so epic and jeb was so

447
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:56,160
pathetic but when dinner bone and broke

448
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,320
out when i did feel empathetic

449
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,880
i saw someone ride the rails and wanted

450
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:15,520
to have a run so even though it killed

451
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:24,760
me at least i died having some fun

452
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:24,760
[Music]

453
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,840
okay

454
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,080
but i think it's safe to say that i'd

455
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,600
rather die again and suffer through

456
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,919
another lonely day

457
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:42,240
at your place it was horror a disgrace

458
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,799
you have no honest say you miss me now

459
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:47,039
but in life it was all torture you never

460
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,600
knew the value that i had when i was

461
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,679
living

462
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,120
but now i'm gone you realize what you

463
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,360
were always missing

464
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,480
i was the perfect sheep and now when

465
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,960
you're asleep

466
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,960

to give my opinion

476
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:53,120
