116
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:52,480
traumatic where's this freaking tub

117
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:55,510

118
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:58,360
a flying fish why are they flying I

119
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:59,860
pluck you oh I killed him sorry I didn't

120
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,020
mean to do that I had one of my most

121
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:04,180
traumatic experiences ever because we

122
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:06,010
were fated we were snorkeling in this

123
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:08,440
amazing water kind of like this

124
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:10,660
obviously not alien fishes and stuff but

125
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,790
it was like unreal for a Swedish person

126
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:15,669
at least who's done a lot of snorkeling

127
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:18,280
in my day I was still amazed by all the

128
00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:19,930
fishies hey I can make the fiber now to

129
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:22,240
make the radiation suit does it make two

130
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:24,250
of them or does it make one at them I

131
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,250
think it made one of them dang it

132
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:28,750
so I was fishy to me she fishing as you

133
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:30,580
do as a Swedish but I put the egg in

134
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:33,190
there looking at the fish chest it was

135
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:35,260
all relaxing it was all nice it was

136
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:38,340
wonderful it was so cool you could like

137
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:41,320
swim up to fish and be like hey do that

138
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:44,919
but then all the sudden all the fish is

139
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:48,070
just boom and I was like oh that's weird

140
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:50,080
and I'm like out pretty far as well like

141
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:51,550
this it was basically like this you see

142
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,830
all the fishes just fly away and I'm

143
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:55,630
like alright strange guest fishes do

144
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:59,050
that no they don't

145
00:06:55,630 --> 00:07:02,260
in out of nowhere comes to giant fish

146
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:16,770
with teeth sticking out like in my

147
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:16,770
peripheral where do you come from

148
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:23,070
[Laughter]

149
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:32,010
[Laughter]

150
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:41,210
[Laughter]

151
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:50,780
at least I can pause in the game because

152
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:53,540
what happened was I I saw it and I was

153
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:56,270
so scared I threw myself up on the beach

154
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:57,710
like wow I thought it was a shark it

155
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:59,630
wasn't a shark it was a fish like this

156
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:02,090
like I think it was a barracuda or

157
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:04,250
something it still scared me clearly

158
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:06,680
