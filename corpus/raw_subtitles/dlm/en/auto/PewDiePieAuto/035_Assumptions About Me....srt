3
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:21,060

21
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:06,210
sponsor party I've been playing a lot of

22
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:08,430
rocket League lately and in game

23
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:10,830
matchmaking can sometimes be amazing and

24
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,900
sometimes be their worst experience ever

25
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:16,020

great teammate I love to play more with

28
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,060
him so I know all about ending up with

29
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:22,710
the wrong kind of players but the fact

30
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,210
is there's a ton of great players out

31
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:25,920
there and especially in rocket League as

32
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:28,020
well sometimes I end up with people that

33
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,970
are so nice that it makes me regain

34
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,740
respect for Humanity so why not just

it's cool ok now back to assumptions ok

58
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:13,470
number one you can't go outside because

59
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,540
you'll get stopped everywhere

60
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:17,610
that's not true I don't get stop that

61
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,800
off there I think it's that every time I

62
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:21,780
go outside I have to be conscious that

63
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,820
it's gonna happen I think that's more

64
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,820
that's annoying then the fact that it

65
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:28,380
does usually I like it it's just it

66
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:30,420
changes your perspective on going

67
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:32,760
outside which I don't always like okay

68
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:35,850
heard this crazy one where they said

69
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,650
PewDiePie does have no next what is this

70
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:39,780
garbage come on people think you are

71
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:45,300
uninformed about the world beyond Kings

72
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:47,670
and memes I mean yeah you're not wrong I

73
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,860
think the world I don't know much about

74
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:51,959
the world but I do have a good

75
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,730
understanding of myself which is my

76
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:56,430
world which is all that matters

77
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:59,750
thank you you seem well educated humble

78
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:03,600
and and I thought I read genius first

79
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:05,310
yes and generous your wealth has an

80
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,590
inflated your ego and you seem to be

81
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:09,300
passionate about what you do look at

82
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:11,730
Timmy you're supposed to be going on

83
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,770
leaves not to be so nice Jesus I don't

84
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:16,260
know where I go on this now money hasn't

85
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:18,360
inflate my ego because I don't value it

86
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:20,220
that much anyway I think when people put

87
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,110
more importance on money than it is

88
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:23,880
that's when that sort of thing happened

89
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:26,070
educated no I don't really think so

90
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:28,050
humble yeah maybe generous and that

91
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:29,670
could be more I could be more generous

92
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:33,390
let's get real here you really hate

93
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:35,370
compliments yes but they're meaningful

94
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:37,920
to you I don't know if meaningful that's

95
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:39,989
right word I do appreciate it of course

96
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,190
who doesn't like compliments but they do

97
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:43,799
generally make me feel uncomfortable

98
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:45,540
most of the time and I think I also am

99
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:47,610
aware that I like to compliment people

100
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:49,620
because I want them to feel good I mean

101
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:52,080
maybe it doesn't come across as hundred

102
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:53,790
percent genuine even though I wanted to

103
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,430
so I feel like in the back of my mind

104
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:58,860
when I receive money I'm projecting my

105
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:01,980
own way of approaching compliments unto

106
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:04,709
other people ah you're really smart and

107
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:06,959
an intellectual yeah actually kin pal I

108
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:09,630
feel like I'm very dumb I'm not gonna I

109
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,220
feel like I'm dumb smart if I really put

110
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:12,450
my mind I'm more of a slow thinker I

111
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:16,500
would say and I think that's why I like

112
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:18,930
philosophy I'm not so snappy as I'd like

113
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,580
to be but thank you I always thought you

114
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:22,620
were a genuine guy but often we'd go

115
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:25,229
through an existential crisis when

116
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,630
things go wrong no not when things go

117
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:29,390
wrong just my well

118
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:31,940
being and how how things seem online are

119
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:34,850
not the same thing I would say but not

120
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:37,460
anymore no more existential crises yeah

121
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:39,290
I wanted to do something like dab

122
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:42,020
ironically but I feel like even that

123
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:43,910
doesn't count as ironic anymore but I'll

124
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:45,740
do it anyway who cares it's 20/20

125
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:47,390
anything can happen I think some people

126
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:49,100
think you are overrated because you're

127
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:51,260
just at home recording videos but they

128
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:56,750
don't understand the immense work you

129
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:59,270
went through and stuff I think hmm I

130
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:00,890
don't know about that it's not like its

131
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:03,770
immense work I'm gonna use that

132
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:07,550
adjective but if anything I think people

133
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:09,680
under assumed or evaluate the risk I

134
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:12,860
took going into YouTube during that time

135
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:15,170
when it wasn't even a job at all it's

136
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:17,350
something that I wanted to pursue so the

137
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:21,310
risk involved with approaching it and

138
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:23,630
the consistency required to perform and

139
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:27,650
constantly change and adapt in the

140
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:32,360
platform to keep things fresh which is

141
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:33,950
ironic flora gag oh I think it's my

142
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,180
point is it's easier to just look at one

143
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:37,550
of my latest videos and be like I don't

144
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:39,140
really get it this is not that big of a

145
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:40,670
deal and I agree yes

146
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:42,380
but there's this whole catalogue of

147
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:43,130
years and years alright it takes time

148
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,800
all right

149
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:47,570
obvious one is that you're right leeming

150
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:51,200
I hear that a lot whenever I watch your

151
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:52,820
videos what from me not from me who is

152
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,320
telling you from watching my videos I

153
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,880
don't know where my political views are

154
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,620
and I don't care to state them online

155
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,350
anyway because it doesn't matter that's

156
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:02,390
not why I make videos do you feel that

157
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:04,640
when you were in office in the office

158
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:06,230
I'm like another political goddammit

159
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:08,540
so I used to have an office a few years

160
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:10,700
ago and they assumed that I had a battle

161
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:12,830
and State at the time it seemed like as

162
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:15,320
a youtuber it was like okay we're gonna

163
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:17,180
build like a team and we're gonna have

164
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,920
like an office and we're gonna like make

165
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,930
this a production and all of a blah and

166
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:23,090
I'm like yeah I guess that makes sense

167
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:25,310
from a natural progression standpoint

168
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:27,590
but from what I like about YouTube no I

169
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:29,270
and I think it's the same with you guys

170
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:31,630
that's the charm of YouTube aside it's

171
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:34,820
not necessarily these big productions

172
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:37,940
big words helped me at least that's what

173
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:39,620
I enjoy I can enjoy production stuff as

174
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,460
well I think the multitude of YouTube is

175
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:42,620
what makes it fun

176
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,690
there's no right and wrong but is this

177
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:49,040
going from what I prefer that's what I

178
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:51,410
learned bad mental state always it's

179
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,970
like I did a video celebrating my 10

180
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:55,250
years and I'm like oh that was a tough

181
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:59,720
year oh my god that wasn't even tougher

182
00:06:55,250 --> 00:07:01,130
year oh my god it's like I I think for

183
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,290
the first time in a long time I'm right

184
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:05,690
I'm really glad to be making videos and

185
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:08,690
just doing my thing and not dealing with

186
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:10,040
all this drama for once everyone thinks

187
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:12,020
you're really humble but you've actually

188
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,820
had to think about and deal with your

189
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,950
fame and money through a philosophical

190
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:19,220
approach and you'd had ups and downs

191
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:21,440
with the ups and downs absolutely I

192
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,910
think my interesting philosophy doesn't

193
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,500
necessarily have anything to do with my

194
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:26,780
situation on YouTube it's just something

195
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:29,870
I enjoy and I like to draw parallels

196
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:32,270
between it from my own experiences but

197
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:34,160
it's not something that I did because to

198
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:36,140
deal with fame and money know on how to

199
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,910
deal with it I'd like to think you act

200
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:39,320
just as crazy off-camera and that might

201
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:43,490
send was some time like to stab you in

202
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:47,510
the back because she can't have - no

203
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:49,190
that's not true I think myself is says

204
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:51,230
I'm way too serious off-camera

205
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:53,600
which I don't like but I don't like when

206
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:55,940
people are always crazy I think a lot of

207
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:58,370
youtubers that our act crazy are

208
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:59,750
actually crazy but I I'm not the case

209
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:02,030
and I think that's why I like about my

210
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:05,090
personality is that I can have different

211
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:06,740
sides of the same personality I think

212
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:08,690
that it's more interesting

213
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:10,970
you're a proper introvert that would be

214
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:12,980
a really good friend once you are close

215
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:14,540
enough to someone well I like to think I

216
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:17,390
am but I don't have that many close

217
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:19,790
friends I would say I'm in ambivert both

218
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:23,810
introvert necks extroverted but probably

219
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:27,440
more introvert I assume you don't have a

220
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:30,110
skincare routine hey I do

221
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,880
I'm oyster right my skin gets very dry

222
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,830
thank you very much

223
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,210
I tried skincare at teens and I can't

224
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:37,460
tell a difference I'm like I feel like

225
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:39,640
this is just expensive you're self aware

226
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:42,710
of your attractive qualities

227
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:45,380
narcissistically mm-hmm well I do know

228
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:47,900
what I like about myself but I know if I

229
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:50,060
wanted to look the best I had to look I

230
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:52,300
wouldn't be rocking this haircut and

231
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:54,670
this beard okay I'm well aware of that

232
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:57,850
so I wouldn't say I'm that narcissistic

233
00:08:54,670 --> 00:09:00,610
about my attractive qualities the floor

234
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:02,880
gang is a cult no it's a religion come

235
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:05,320
on that I hate the spotlight

236
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,660
whatever let's make this fake I'm just

237
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:09,910
thinking I guess I don't like speaking

238
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:12,400
unless I feel very confident that I have

239
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:14,950
something to contribute so if I'm put in

240
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,270
the spotlight on deliberately I don't

241
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:17,950
thrive on the attention that that

242
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:19,570
generates that I think a lot of people

243
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:21,310
get energy from that doesn't mean

244
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:21,730
there's a right and wrong it's just how

245
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:24,160
I am

246
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:28,030
at big that you were actually Felix

247
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:30,670
check know that guy Hayden we need to

248
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:32,650
cancel Felix Kjellberg he always gets

249
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:34,720
away with it it's always PewDiePie does

250
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:36,940
this PewDiePie to say no one talks about

251
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,890
Felix Kjellberg huh people are seeing

252
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:40,810
assume you're still the old PewDiePie

253
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:43,000
and haven't changed for the better after

254
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:44,680
your controversies yeah it's been pretty

255
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,210
clear that the people that have made up

256
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:48,340
their mind about me are just gonna think

257
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:50,440
that way forever and I'm okay with that

258
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:53,170
that's their problem not mine your

259
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:55,420
choice of clothing is an expensive and

260
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:58,690
unrealistic for some people check out

261
00:09:55,420 --> 00:10:02,800
the merch guys buy it yes I think you're

262
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:03,790
right I try to avoid fast fashion

263
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,980
because it's not good for the

264
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:08,410
environment but it's not something that

265
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:10,630
I judge out there for if they don't or

266
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:13,390
wear expensive clothing to sort of

267
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:15,160
boasts about status or something I just

268
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:18,970
think it's better okay it's better

269
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:22,390
better quality better design it lasts

270
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:24,760
longer better for environment more

271
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:26,650
ethically produced since I have the

272
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,690
choice to do it then why shouldn't I

273
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:30,700
people think you play horror games as

274
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:32,530
your main content yeah it's funny this

275
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:34,930
happens all the time especially when I

276
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:36,730
get recognized that's how I know I don't

277
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:38,590
need that whole what it would we had a

278
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:40,330
code word before if you were gonna meet

279
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:42,220
me on the street what would say if math

280
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:51,340
related to science I don't need it I can

281
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:52,930
tell ya I mean I yeah I do are you just

282
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:55,180
want to be polite and reply as well it's

283
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:57,730
so it's so weird some people I know

284
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:58,840
think that you're petrified wouldn't

285
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:02,140
thinking about letting go of YouTube

286
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:03,640
like you don't know what next

287
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:05,150
I think the break that I had this

288
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,650
January was a very good

289
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:08,330
in Decatur because I wasn't sure as well

290
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:10,310
but I definitely learned that I'm I

291
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:12,470
don't have to make it to videos I was

292
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:14,360
really happy not doing it as well but

293
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:15,410
it's just something I enjoy I'm not

294
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,270
afraid of letting go

295
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:19,460
that doesn't mean I'm gonna stop I'm not

296
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:21,590
I'm not planning on it okay calm down if

297
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:23,180
anything I enjoy YouTube now like these

298
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:24,860
past months has been the most fun I had

299
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:27,020
in a long time especially building

300
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:28,730
members that's been really fun you're

301
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:31,430
shy but won't admit it

302
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:35,900
yeah I'm shy what do you want huh thank

303
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:38,210
you god damn Mike I hate to setup no I'm

304
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:41,180
shy but I don't like it that that's the

305
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:42,470
truth I try to push myself to not be but

306
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:45,080
it's really hard and it comes to them

307
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:46,400
people kick when it stays and it comes

308
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,890
across very obvious when they interact

309
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:51,620
with other people online sometimes and I

310
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:53,840
hate it and that makes it worse the fact

311
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:56,270
that I'm aware of it it's like oh god I

312
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,740
got a hiccup sign if he doesn't need the

313
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:59,780
money why is it so worried about

314
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:01,340
monetizing his videos clearly you just

315
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:03,140
care about money that's an assumption

316
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:04,280
people make I'm not gonna stand in line

317
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:06,650
and say I don't like money

318
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:08,870
of course if I have to the choice of

319
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:10,670
having money and not having it I will

320
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:11,420
choose to rather have it thank you very

321
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:14,330
much

322
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:16,250
however it's not a driving factor for me

323
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:16,910
it's not what makes me want to make more

324
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,130
videos

325
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:21,140
it does help and having YouTube as a job

326
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:23,000
has helped me be more consistent with it

327
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:25,820
so it has some factor I would say but

328
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,950
for example with memberships all the

329
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:29,990
money goes to charity and I really

330
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:32,420
really like kind of starting from

331
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:34,100
scratch and building a community again

332
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:36,230
from the bottom and that's it's been

333
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:38,390
really motivating and fun for me and I

334
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:41,180
don't make money out of the members

335
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:42,650
anyway so I think it's clear where to me

336
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:44,390
at least where my motivation is that it

337
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:46,880
doesn't make it less motivating for me

338
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:48,410
highly self-aware I'd say yeah I think

339
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,270
you took kind of forces you to become

340
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:51,410
more self-aware it forces you to be

341
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,030
self-aware especially when you're on

342
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:54,770
there's a lot of scrutiny because you

343
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:57,800
have to just be honest with yourself a

344
00:12:54,770 --> 00:13:01,190
lot of times when people online get

345
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:04,490
upset about things you really have to

346
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:06,080
examine it sounds like I'm excusing my

347
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:08,030
past behaviour it's not what I meant but

348
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:10,520
when so many people hate you online you

349
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:13,280
just have to understand what is actual

350
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:15,170
ate and what is actual criticism and

351
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:17,540
do actually really take in a lot of

352
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:19,550
criticism but because I'm forced to

353
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:21,620
learn how to be self-aware I have to

354
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:23,870
I've learned to make the distinction of

355
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:26,000
okay what is actual criticism and what

356
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:28,370
is actual just random hate and I think

357
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,330
that's how I become more self-aware it

358
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:34,790
feels a bit cringy to say oh I'm so self

359
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:39,410
self-aware which me recognizing that is

360
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:41,180
kind of self-aware this guy's famous

361
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:43,190
just because he's handsome this guy is

362
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:46,100
number two and under most handsome faces

363
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:48,230
just because he's famous oh you walked

364
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:51,860
in your own trap a loophole

365
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:54,980
just like when I drink while peeing good

366
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:57,380
comment very nice I have nothing to sex

367
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:59,600
you really dislike most of YouTube which

368
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:02,660
is why you don't collab with anyone new

369
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:05,330
it's not true a collab with ninja I

370
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:07,370
could live with James Charles and that

371
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:10,070
was fun and I'm not necessarily the

372
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:12,530
biggest fan but I still enjoy it I think

373
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:14,660
it's more the fact that I don't like

374
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:16,520
asking people hey you want to collab

375
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:18,350
that feels weird to me I don't know why

376
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,940
I really hate asking people for stuff

377
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:21,740
probably because people ask me

378
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,400
for stuff all the time for that I'm just

379
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:24,380
kidding

380
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:26,720
I do enjoy it that's what I'm saying I

381
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:28,820
just don't like asking my assumption you

382
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,000
enjoy interacting with fans even if you

383
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:32,240
can't do it often yeah absolutely

384
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,710
absolutely

385
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,720
I hold the meeting Greeks and everyday

386
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:37,220
stuff are always super fun Adam see how

387
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,650
I know one can just like that you're

388
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:41,510
uninterested in life now no I think for

389
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:43,880
the first time in a long time I feel

390
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:45,620
very enthusiastic about the future my

391
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:47,660
life and where things are gonna go next

392
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:50,780
so I'm happy I've seen a few people

393
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:52,640
assume you're bisexual what you said a

394
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:54,500
few times in lives and stuff but a lot

395
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,570
of time I honestly can't tell every

396
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,640
joking or not because you do use a lot

397
00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:03,350
of sarcasm all right well let me clear

398
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:05,360
this up I'm not bisexual how where do

399
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:07,460
people make that assumption I find men

400
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,860
to be very gross and I don't even

401
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:11,839
understand how women can like men but

402
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:13,880
each to their own I guess you have a

403
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:16,070
habit like you are being recorded all

404
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,630
the time for example and you like

405
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:19,330
talking with yourself while playing

406
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:24,140
games even though you're not recording

407
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:26,480
know what the hell I know how to switch

408
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:27,860
it on and up it's very easy for me I

409
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,240
you script a lot of videos in my head

410
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,160
though if they're supposed to be

411
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,779
scripted I most of them aren't but if

412
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,699
there's a bigger video I usually don't

413
00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:36,560
have to write notes before I'd Sisley

414
00:15:34,699 --> 00:15:38,540
boom I have it in my head I always

415
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:41,269
assumed you were super short yeah and

416
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:43,790
guess what I'm 9 usually people that

417
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:45,139
seem you're tall because they don't see

418
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:47,389
you on camera what the hell all right

419
00:15:45,139 --> 00:15:49,940
there you go there you go everyone

420
00:15:47,389 --> 00:15:52,070
confirm I'm 180 by the way stop assuming

421
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:57,019
otherwise why is it even a thing even

422
00:15:52,070 --> 00:16:02,870
though I say it 179 okay fine I think

423
00:15:57,019 --> 00:16:06,680
you sometimes actually die no no no you

424
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:08,870
do like drugs like weed and stuff no god

425
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:11,779
I keep getting hiccups sorry I just had

426
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:15,170
lunch it's not me lying

427
00:16:11,779 --> 00:16:17,389
I don't hiccup when I look didn't have a

428
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:20,209
whiskey face though you like Ben Shapiro

429
00:16:17,389 --> 00:16:22,040
Paul Joseph Watson ed Trump although we

430
00:16:20,209 --> 00:16:23,810
all know you clearly don't yeah it seems

431
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:26,120
like a lot of people wants to impose

432
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:27,709
political views onto me especially

433
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,269
better up here because he was on meme

434
00:16:27,709 --> 00:16:30,980
review personally I don't like their

435
00:16:29,269 --> 00:16:33,199
whole oh you can't interact with someone

436
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:35,839
just cuz you engaged with someone means

437
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:38,180
to share their political opinions which

438
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:40,339
isn't true and I hate that idea that you

439
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:42,829
can't even talk to each other what's the

440
00:16:40,339 --> 00:16:44,329
point I just find that very toxic how do

441
00:16:42,829 --> 00:16:46,069
you change people's mind if you don't

442
00:16:44,329 --> 00:16:47,899
engage with each other that's not why I

443
00:16:46,069 --> 00:16:49,130
did the collab a for anything I did it

444
00:16:47,899 --> 00:16:55,190
just because I thought it was really

445
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:57,380
funny that's the sole reason and I feel

446
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:59,209
like that's a good explanation of all my

447
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:00,949
controversies because I've always just

448
00:16:59,209 --> 00:17:02,899
proved okay this is funny to me

449
00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:05,480
some people might misunderstand this but

450
00:17:02,899 --> 00:17:07,790
it's really funny that's what's putting

451
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:11,990
me in trouble for most things you are

452
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:14,049
action NOLA no 179 I'm alright I'll

453
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:16,309
measure myself like at some point

454
00:17:14,049 --> 00:17:18,470
subscribe and come member join the

455
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:20,000
member gang and then we'll settle it

456
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:22,040
once and for all

457
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,929
alright you still want to literally your

458
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,370
channel and start over again because you

459
00:17:23,929 --> 00:17:26,900
like warm since their communities

460
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:28,700
well not anymore now that we can build

461
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,950
members I keep chilling for members but

462
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:33,860
it's been so fun I really really really

463
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:35,480
enjoy that that's really was reminding

464
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:37,429
me of what I enjoy by YouTube it's not

465
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,030
like I have to be forced or surrounded

466
00:17:37,429 --> 00:17:40,740
by obviously super fans but

467
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:42,930
who doesn't like to be around positive

468
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:44,370
people I don't know I do I mean I don't

469
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:45,930
I do I do

470
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:51,210
a lot of people have the assumption that

471
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:54,660
you don't work much is that true I would

472
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:55,740
say I have worked a lot yeah I work a

473
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:58,440
lot I work a lot

474
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:00,210
- ever definitely say it - I guess I

475
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,220
compare myself to other jobs and I know

476
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:03,990
there's so many harder jobs out there

477
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:07,470
especially with with how much you work

478
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:09,390
so it feels a bit mean to say I work a

479
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:10,890
lot but at the same time I feel like I

480
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:12,600
figured out how to be very effective

481
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:14,430
with YouTube and that saves me a lot of

482
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,530
time and sometimes I can be frustrating

483
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:19,590
too because I making videos is what I

484
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:21,480
really enjoy and a lot of times like 90

485
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:23,700
percent of the work I do doesn't show

486
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,750
because it's not in videos and you know

487
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,910
like I said sometimes that can be

488
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:30,120
frustrating because it's like on talking

489
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:31,740
to all these different people about all

490
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,330
these different things that doesn't feel

491
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:35,520
like this is not what I signed up for

492
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:37,110
but it's necessary for me to maintain my

493
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,000
business I guess you know what I mean

494
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:40,440
you know what I mean that's why I like

495
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,560
live streams it's more time to engage

496
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:45,450
with you guys so become a more Vicki

497
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:47,340
description you had a STONER face whisky

498
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:49,050
face whisky face for sure

499
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:51,420
now you're annoying dude who do question

500
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:52,770
of things for views and fame I've

501
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:55,200
actually seen a lot of people assume

502
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:57,570
this like I some have deliberately got

503
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,700
into all these controversies which to me

504
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:01,830
so silly I know some people do obviously

505
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:03,660
create controversies deliberately but

506
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:05,940
I'm just really dumb I've said it as

507
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:08,370
many times two things consistent floor

508
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:13,170
gang me very dumb reckless is the right

509
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:14,610
word why am i wearing headphones I don't

510
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:16,380
need more views and I don't need more

511
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:18,390
fame why would I deliberately cause a

512
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:20,490
bunch of controversy so many people

513
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:22,620
start so strongly believing that there's

514
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:24,050
no such thing as bad publicity he

515
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:26,430
clearly did this on purpose

516
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:29,550
there's definitely something called bad

517
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:31,620
publicity a schlub and Paul this is the

518
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:33,960
best example you are tired of political

519
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:35,970
correctness we have this day and age you

520
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,280
would love doing more dark humor again

521
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:41,040
if it wouldn't immediately result in

522
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:42,750
shite [ __ ] reporting the comedy a lot

523
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:45,210
of times is walking that balance of

524
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:46,830
where it's okay to joke about and where

525
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:48,390
it's not and there can be a lot of

526
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:49,920
stress and tension around that and I

527
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:51,780
think that's why people like to laugh at

528
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,800
the dark humor because it alleviates

529
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:55,230
that

530
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:57,390
where the line goes I don't think really

531
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:59,490
matters it's not like darker is better I

532
00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:01,560
think it's more of how you approach that

533
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:06,720
line it's something I've learned way too

534
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:08,610
late way too late dark over ng stuff to

535
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,080
me now it's just kind of cringing you

536
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:11,940
want to speak about some hot topics or

537
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,580
things that happen around the world but

538
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:16,740
you can't be honest because in that case

539
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:18,780
it will harm your reputation so it's the

540
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:21,420
same thing except I had talking about

541
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:23,370
topics I think it's fun to see both try

542
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:26,040
and at least understand both perspective

543
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:27,860
of different ideas and I like to play

544
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:30,060
devil's advocate so even if I don't

545
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:32,490
agree with something I like to try and

546
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:34,170
understand okay well how do they come to

547
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:36,810
this conclusion or is there something

548
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:39,950
good in their approach that's not

549
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:42,390
allowed to do online you cannot do that

550
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:44,850
people just immediately say oh you're

551
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:47,610
defending this or oh yeah it's it's not

552
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:50,040
a big deal but it's that's frustrating

553
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:52,590
to me more than the whole oh you've been

554
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:54,090
TPT or whatever people assume you're

555
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:57,090
racist well this is great because now I

556
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:58,650
can say flat out I'm not racist I don't

557
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:01,890
know the time and energy to raise this

558
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:03,210
and it if I had the time and energy

559
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:07,290
though was kidding

560
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:08,160
dice shouldn't joke got that me your

561
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:09,570
understand what I mean

562
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:12,390
I'm just saying like it doesn't even

563
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:14,280
make sense you are an extreme clean

564
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:16,620
freak you hate and feel unproductive

565
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:18,240
when your house is a mess that your

566
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:20,130
perfection is and all your videos have

567
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,720
to be perfect have you seen my camera

568
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:26,790
quality I'm not a perfectionist

569
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:28,680
whatsoever although it does look kind of

570
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:30,420
nicer and because I have the lights on

571
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:32,880
that's why you can see them clean free

572
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:34,350
yeah yeah I would say I think if you

573
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,370
take care of the things you have and

574
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:37,770
make sure they're clean you'll

575
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:40,290
appreciate them much more as opposed to

576
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:42,780
maybe you have a lot but it's really

577
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:44,490
messy and crazy I would much rather have

578
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:46,440
fewer things and really care for them

579
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:48,660
and I don't know if that has as much to

580
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:50,400
do with clean freak as how I look in

581
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:51,780
items you never give up you always

582
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,400
strive to be either next time that's

583
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:56,010
right if you never give up you can never

584
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:58,230
fail remember that gamers that was a all

585
00:21:56,010 --> 00:22:01,440
right that was fun a lot nicer than I

586
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:03,030
thought it would be but thank you Thank

587
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,710
You members best a memory effect right

588
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,750
there

589
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:07,130
I feel like if I if I asked in the

590
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,899
general chat people would just make a

591
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:10,460
bunch of troll once yeah I feel like

592
00:22:08,899 --> 00:22:12,320
that would be a good time to just say

593
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:13,940
thank you like I said before I think for

594
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,429

00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:18,200
just genuinely happy with everything in

596
00:22:16,429 --> 00:22:19,940
my life obviously there's things I wish

597
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:23,090
would change you know me and my sister

598
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:25,039
were supposed to move yada yada yada but

599
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:26,720

00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,309
things will never be perfect and you

601
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,649
just need to be happy in the moment and

602
00:22:28,309 --> 00:22:33,440
