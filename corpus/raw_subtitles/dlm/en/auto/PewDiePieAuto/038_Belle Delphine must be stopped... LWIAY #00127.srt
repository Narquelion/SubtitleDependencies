on this subreddit

199
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,480

203
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:33,519
air whoa

204
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:36,640
all right long ago

205
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:38,880
all four gangs live together in harmony

206
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,200
then everything changed when the feeling

207
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:44,480
gang attacked

208
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,360
only the avatar master of all four gangs

209
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,519
could stop them

210
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,399
but when the world needed him most he

211
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,480
vanished

212
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,560
a hundred years passed and my brother

213
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,120
and i discovered the news

214
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,040
a floor gang member named pewdiepie and

215
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,959
although his tambourine playing skills

216
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,959
were great he has a lot to learn before

217
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:03,519
he is ready to defeat kokomo

218
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:05,839
but i believe pewdiepie can save the

219
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,839
world

220
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,279
