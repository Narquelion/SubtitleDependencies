doing your part I want to print it is

28
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:38,759
that's so sick camera quality of 77 year

29
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:40,560
old man with 137 subscribership camera

30
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:46,860

31
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:50,430
subscribed youtuber all right I'll let

32
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:53,610
you in on a little secret it's not me

33
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:55,649
who messes up the camera quality it's my

34
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:57,719
editor and I know my editor sitting

35
00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:01,079
there I don't know Brad or side go an

36
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:03,210
earlier to look look at this do you see

37
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:06,540
this high quality camera that I have

38
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:08,729
right here you can't see it right maybe

39
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,020
you can see it for a second I'm not

40
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,780
joking that I have lutely

41
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,310
I know it seems like I'm like but I have

42
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,260
this high quality

43
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:19,140
but anytime I send over the footage it

44
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:22,860
looks like garbage hello everyone it's

45
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:25,349
me Aluna larionova I genuinely have no

46
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:29,099
idea how he manages to make the footage

47
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:33,120
look so bad when I look over here is the

48
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:37,560
information on his video quality

49
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:40,709
it's an MPEG movie it's 10 AE frame rate

50
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:44,400
of 30 there's nothing here so it's

51
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:49,530
technically wrong it's only 1 point 4 9

52
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:53,569
gigabytes for about 25 minutes of

53
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:58,379
footage I am recording on a webcam at

54
00:02:53,569 --> 00:03:00,930
720p through OBS it's the same process

55
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:03,120
that he uses and yet my quality looks

56
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:07,230
like that and his looks like that so

57
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:09,180
it's not me and it's not scythe I don't

58
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:12,569
know how he does it and after 5 years

59
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:14,790
I've stopped trying to figure out what

60
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:16,410
he's doing over there I just take the

61
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:20,639
footage and go that's what he's given me

62
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:22,950
and I edit it into something thanks bye

63
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:25,260
we should all subscribe to Marcia and

64
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:28,349
give 10 million diamond play blood as a

army that is so sweet I think it's not

67
00:03:31,889 --> 00:03:35,549
the camera

68
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:37,200
it's just peer to himself it's not in HD

69
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:40,349
this is what I'm talking about

70
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,480
it's not the camera I care about quality

71
00:03:40,349 --> 00:03:44,609
guys it's one of my most important

72
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,160
aspects of the video I say if the camera

73
00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:50,069
quality is not good enough we cut the

74
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:53,639

most subscribed to movie reviewer end I

126
00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:14,899
mean I appreciate it thank you very much

127
00:06:11,509 --> 00:06:17,169
but this is the kind of language of

128
00:06:14,899 --> 00:06:19,669
someone admitting defeat

129
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:22,369
there will be no brofist for this

130
00:06:19,669 --> 00:06:23,719
episode for this kind of attitude I know

131
00:06:22,369 --> 00:06:26,089
it might seem a little harsh because

132
00:06:23,719 --> 00:06:28,939
this is a heartfelt genuine message but

133
00:06:26,089 --> 00:06:31,129
I cannot condone this

134
00:06:28,939 --> 00:06:33,439
 of attitude alright I don't want

135
00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:36,240
to say that word but that's what you are

136
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:39,330
we either win it or we die

137
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:42,960
that's how life works Sun Tzu's said

138
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:45,240
himself the general warlord anyone

139
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,160
fighting to the death will fight ten

140
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:51,860
times stronger and that's what we're

141
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:54,900
doing here none of this book precomposed

142
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:57,810
losing strategy I don't think so

143
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,979
not on my watch and therefore I retract

144
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:02,099
any brofist

145
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:03,960
that I have previously given that's

146
00:07:02,099 --> 00:07:06,810
right I bet you didn't know I had this

147
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:09,539
power but at any given moment I can give

148
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:10,979
and I can take and I take away brofist

149
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:13,080
just like that

150
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:15,090
I take of them away from you and I don't

151
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:18,780
care about the tears because we have a

152
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:23,160
mission we have something to work ok

153
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:24,900

delivery service ok

think should this be the new upvote

171
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:19,320
design it looks like they've already

172
00:08:16,469 --> 00:08:20,039
implemented very well the people have

173
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,979
spoken

174
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:26,669
I love democracy you've seen gold Brad

still wear pants ok even if I don't have

179
00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:41,190
legs I can still wear them this is the

180
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:44,159
kind of discriminatory nature that makes

181
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:46,959
me reflect brofist pewdiepie vs t series

182
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:51,620
