that one too i did the side quest

69
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,520
is that better

70
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:25,759
massive increase to health stagger

it's whatever i i also have the blow gun

357
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,320
now which can

358
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:19,360
poison and hallucinate people i still

359
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,360
don't know how it works

360
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,840
but yeah that move is pretty good

361
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,679
the armor makes it so i can do one more

362
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:34,640
extra slice and then

363
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:34,640
there's the move where i can charge uh

364
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:41,360

try the blowgun in this area okay yeah

368
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,720
that might be a good time to try it

369
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,720
because i never actually tried it

370
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,200
so hallucination makes it so they go
