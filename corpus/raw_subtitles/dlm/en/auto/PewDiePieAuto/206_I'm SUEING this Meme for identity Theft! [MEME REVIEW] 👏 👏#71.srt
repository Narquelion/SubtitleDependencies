00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:32,460

00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:09,659
around this purpose is the one where

21
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:18,500
their girlfriend is in the window epic

00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:24,659
just that it's so relatable and watch

25
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,619

97
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,800
I wouldn't fall for it I'm a stupid

98
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:02,260
child this has become a meme for

99
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:07,360
whatever reason to lie about it gonna

100
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:09,910
tell my kids this is Obama I'm gonna

101
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,220
tell my kids this is Jana and Yoko

102
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:14,200
that's so nice gonna tell my kids this

103
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:18,070

104
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:20,440

00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:26,470
my kids this was Obama okay alright

108
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:31,840

00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:33,670
my kids in this is just intruder okay

110
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,260
that's good that's good I like that I

111
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:37,840
can see there's meme popping off it's

112
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:40,930
still pretty early so therefore I will

113
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:43,540
give it at zero there's really why am I

114
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:45,400
even doing this episodes so bad you do

115
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:47,620
things that are typically considered

116
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,630
inappropriate or immoral but the author

117
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:51,670
consider them to be good or maybe he

118
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:53,260
doesn't I can tell when these are ironic

119
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:55,900
and when they aren't because my brain is

120
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:57,820
so small this is correct statement why

121
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:00,070
does this look like me Jesus Christ even

122
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:01,129
the camera angle this is fate I need

123
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:04,239

183
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:37,039
how can this happen

184
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:38,899
so there's a bunch of controversy about

185
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,060
the new Pokemon game saying that they

186
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:44,390
are reusing models from different

187
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:45,920
Pokemon games even though allegedly the

188
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,329
studio said we want to focus on high

189
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,300
quality animations and make the game

190
00:08:47,329 --> 00:08:52,519
more expressive overall wow it looks so

191
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:53,870
expressive so much in the game I think

192
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:56,240
they also said that they were gonna cut

193
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:57,620
some of the pokemons from in like

194
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,839
they're just gonna be less pokemons in

195
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:02,420
this one because they wanted to make

196
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:05,300
them good I guess but in reality they

197
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:07,730
just took the exact same model wow I

198
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:09,950
mean I guess it's not that big of a deal

199
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:11,870
to reuse animations and stuff like that

200
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:13,690
but if you lie about it that's a

201
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:15,980
different story I mean look at this

202
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:18,140
embarrassing you know what Pokemon like

203
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:20,510
game didn't lie to their audience that's

204
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:22,640
right Beauty pipes pixel Inc we didn't

205
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:24,950

[Laughter]

209
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:45,690
[Music]

210
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:52,790

211
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:55,850

216
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:05,230
more examples

217
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:12,960
guys we couldn't add enough Pokemon said

218
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,180
we just really needed to make it unique

219
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:17,580
and make a high quality as possible

220
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:19,650
Brock can I copy your homework yeah just

221
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,910
make sure like no one notices okay

222
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:22,560
just make it a little bit different

223
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:24,690
there are of course the contrarians

224
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,310
saying people are just nitpicking people

225
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:28,770
are just being freaky sneaky peeky

226
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:32,220
pokemon sword and shield versus ocarina

227
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:35,390
of time Wow pokemons stole directly the

228
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:36,600
texture pack from ocarina of time

229
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:39,270
unbelievable

230
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,490
why does the game look so bad gene says

231
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:43,380
this has led to a lot of fans being very

232
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:45,300
angry I don't really care I just like

233
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:47,370
being part of an angry mob really just

234
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:49,230
got a three point three user score not

235
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:51,510
happy people are very angry as they

236
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:54,030
should as they should these are the

237
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:55,890
things that truly matter 450 Pokemon

238
00:10:54,030 --> 00:11:05,460
were cut for these high quality and it

239
00:10:55,890 --> 00:11:08,340
may shed wow that looks so good fact

240
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:10,320
criticism is not toxicity in fact having

241
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:12,060
standards for a sixty product is not

242
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,250
being entitled Game Freak lied about

243
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:15,840
models being remade supporting or

244
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:17,370
praising these Pokemon tile is fine but

245
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,620
pertaining Game Freak can't possibly do

246
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:23,820
better is not oh the whole game freezes

247
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:25,530
if you go on the ladder okay so

248
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,780
apparently that gif is from illegally

249
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:30,390
stream gameplay and they have explained

250
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,690
that NPCs do indeed freeze when climbing

251
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:33,180
ladder

252
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:36,440

this is an older meme but it's still

261
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:02,750
good it's from the release of the color

262
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:05,920
duty trailer when he goes Bravo six

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,570
epic when you're beating your meat in

265
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:22,760
the bathroom and you hear footsteps near

266
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:25,760

going so bad when you're new on reddit

269
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:32,900
and learn that dark mode is superior

270
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,540
Bravo six

271
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:37,220
going dark how do you not know that

272
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:39,110
Jesus Christ that's pathetic when you're

273
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:41,210
pooping for so long

274
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:44,150
the automatic bathroom lights turns on

275
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:46,610
Bravo six going down that's good I like

276
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:47,240
that whenever that happens I never flail

277
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:49,520
my arm

278
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,290
I just keep squeezing so hard that the

279
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,410
light just comes back on when you

280
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:56,840
decline Google to know your location

281
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:59,690
Bravo six going down when you enable

282
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:01,910

having the Nintendo DS underneath your

288
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:17,000
pillow just like the greatest thing of

289
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:18,950
all time because back in the day when

290
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,330
when you had Game Boy you still needed a

291
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:22,160
little light because they didn't have an

292
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:23,990
internal light source there's a there's

293
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,790
a boom we're talking okay but the D is

294
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:27,550
you could still play it in your bed

295
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:29,090
without in light and it was the best

296
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:31,370
Professor Layton
