tick speed on too quickly

82
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:03,050
these people clearly know nothing about

83
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:07,100

84
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:09,170
about re I know this is very this is

85
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:10,370
extremely controversial and I know a lot

86
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:12,350
of people are gonna say a lot of things

87
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:15,110
about it but I'm thinking about moving

88
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:17,900

90
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,990

98
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:46,490
to do it which is an automatic rule of

99
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,090
