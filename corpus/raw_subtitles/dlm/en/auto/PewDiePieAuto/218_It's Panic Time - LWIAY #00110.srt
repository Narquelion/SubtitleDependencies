times no matter bad time epic meantime I

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,369
think the formula goes the worse things

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:36,239
are the better the memes really so let's

8
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:37,950
just jump in I like this this is good

9
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,170
because it doesn't mention anything hey

10
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:42,390

11
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,190
