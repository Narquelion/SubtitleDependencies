Pro Jared cheated on his wife

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,900

7
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:27,260

pictures of you know I don't want to get

19
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:03,809
into the detail that's for pew news I

20
00:01:00,469 --> 00:01:05,790
think what's important here is the memes

21
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:06,840
okay I don't really care about anything

22
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,880

29
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:27,150

jontron you know the guy that was kicked

50
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:19,600

00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:22,300
things I don't know exactly what he said

52
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,800
but bad things he said bad things we

53
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:28,810
demand that you talk about your old

54
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:31,450

55
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:33,730

00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:42,790

72
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,489

00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:17,110
about this whole thing there's a lot of

74
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:17,830
puzzle pieces that don't really make

75
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:20,050
sense to me

76
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:22,120

77
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:25,060
