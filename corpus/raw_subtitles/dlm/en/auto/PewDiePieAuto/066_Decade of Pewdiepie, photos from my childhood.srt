50
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:16,670

why did you not draw it Felix just so

56
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,250
it's not just my Barry let's find some

57
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:36,650
old photos apparently I liked whatever

58
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:38,900
that squid god I look like a sociopath

59
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:41,510
look at that why am i squeezing that so

60
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:45,680
hard that poor Hedgehog there's me my

61
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:48,350
sister they think this is third grade

62
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,030
that haircut was so popular it was

63
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:51,800
called like a pop haircut because it

64
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:54,140
looks like they put a pot on your head

65
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,360
and cut around but there was a pig I

66
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,800
mean here's a self-portrait that I did

67
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,990
I'd say it's pretty indistinguishable

68
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,709
here's me in first grade you can barely

69
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:03,620
tell them apart

70
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:05,090
honestly nice shade of skin color I

71
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,920
remember that was such a hard thing when

72
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:10,220
you were a kid even like wait what color

73
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:11,930
is skin color who knows no one knows I

74
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:14,510
want to share it with you guys something

75
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:17,780
very special which is the very first

76
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:19,880
comic book I ever made I did the text

77
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:22,190
and I did the illustration it's called

78
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:24,800
the worm I think it was based on the

79
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:26,840
worms the game which was popular at that

80
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,570
time and I'll try and translate the best

81
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:33,530
I can for you guys it was once a mask

82
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:36,820
who lived under a yard or a barn one day

83
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:41,300
he saw frigerator was empty so he

84
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:45,350
descended to himself to go out and hunt

85
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:47,120
he went to the henhouse and took an egg

86
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:49,400
it doesn't look like he took an egg it

87
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,760
looks like he freaking shot an egg with

88
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,080
a bazooka just like worms he boiled the

89
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,270
egg okay

90
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,880
what the breakfast he said then during

91
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:03,060
dinner he was hungry so he went through

92
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:07,440
the forest and haunted then he saw a fox

93
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:09,690
and then he ate Fox for dinner he ate

94
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,580
the Fox hears him shooting the Fox

95
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:14,310
I remember thinking it was so funny to

96
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:14,940
make the ice pop out like I did here in

97
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:17,519
this picture

98
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:19,530
comical genius I was on to something I

99
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,710
knew it I'm into this story it's really

100
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:26,430
good later after dinner he was hungry

101
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:29,760
again so he ate and mousse and he was so

102
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:32,400
full that he exploded then the chicken

103
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:35,400
jumped out of Bailey from the worm bing

104
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,380
bang bong bing bang bang bong my god

105
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:40,680
where's this going and then the chicken

106
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:43,410
ate the worm and then Fox came out of

107
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:47,040
nowhere then the Fox came and ate the

108
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:52,110
chicken and then mousse made the Fox and

109
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:53,700
all that was left was that for moose the

110
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:57,660
end what a story

111
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:59,700
Wow incredible what a Swedish story I

112
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:02,250

00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:04,440

with the background I had to sing for

142
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,690
some performance here and I drew it and

143
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:19,390

always said don't eat them but what we

150
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:34,660
find that later was that the Vikings

151
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:36,670
made them to get amped up and sure and I

152
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:38,140
don't I'm not into drugs and stuff but I

153
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:40,660
kind of want to go back and eat them

mean my Felix is celebrity on YouTube

164
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:13,000
this is in 2012 dude this felt so huge

165
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:15,430
to be recognized for what you were doing

166
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,360
that's crazy he's spoken about for his

167
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:22,330
immersive humor and not the least easily

168
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,890
scared scared early schedule E&S I don't

169
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:26,740
know how they're in translating Felix

170
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:28,690
Kjellberg nickname beauty pie has on a

171
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,650
short time become a celebrity through

172
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:31,540
his YouTube channel

173
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:35,710
very interesting there's a quote from me

174
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:38,500
saying it has really changed my point of

175
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:42,130
view in life I was absolutely not the

176
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:44,170
guy who take a bunch of chances before I

177
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:46,180
don't know that doesn't sound like me at

178
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:48,220
all I think a lot of media in the

179
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:50,080
beginning try to make me seem like I was

180
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:52,060
a total loser and down on my luck

181
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,010
because that sounds like a good success

182
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:55,690

damn I look good man I'm myself just

206
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:51,930
want to be clear that I was not cool but

207
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:54,360
the school photo was also the chance you

208
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:56,550
can get to pretend that you are cool by

209
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,620
making some sort of weird pose that was

210
00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:00,180
your moment to change everything you

211
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,410
want to get a haircut Felix how about

212
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:05,070
that you wanted to try and get a haircut

213
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:07,350
done I really like this one a lot

214
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:09,500
because I let my belt hang between my

215
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:14,700
legs

216
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:19,140
yeah show that Phoebe why I didn't know

217
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:20,490
it'd be weird to put it aside wouldn't

218
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:23,010
it I remember thinking about it that's

219
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:24,750
so dumb I am like well it's a belt what

220
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:26,250

221
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:28,410
do that that's ridiculous

222
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:31,579
oh yeah I found these old posters that I

223
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:36,029
used to I used to sell these posters

224
00:09:31,579 --> 00:09:39,180
they were really cool and I used to

225
00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:42,810
handwrite all of the messages here's the

226
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:46,740
only prize ever won it was for sailing I

227
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:49,760
think first prize oh yeah that was so

228
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:53,839

229
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:59,160
Gothenburg 12 first prize Division three

amazing ah not a good photo

231
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,930
Oh God we got more it never ends does it

232
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:06,300
I'm doing this to expose myself okay

233
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:08,190
yeah I played Peter Pan and I remember

234
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:10,230
this because I borrowed it that I

235
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:12,450
borrowed the outfit from a girl and I

236
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:14,459
for some reason thought that I should be

237
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:16,560
naked underneath the costume by

238
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:18,630
completely naked no underwear I wore no

239
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,820
underwear that caught under that costume

240
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:22,110
is for sick look I'm completely thank

241
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,610
you

242
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:26,560
and I remember having that dilemma of

243
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:28,839
like wait do I wear my underwear

244
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,850
underneath this or not I don't like that

245
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:32,800
would makes no sense because it there's

246
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:34,420
no there's no underwear in this outfit

247
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,459
and I actually remember it was the first

248
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:38,500
time I was on stage and I remember just

249
00:10:36,459 --> 00:10:39,910
kept looking out on the audience I know

250
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,440
I'm supposed to interact with the person

251
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:43,660
it's really how I remember this so well

252
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,160
and I remember looking at the audience

253
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:48,550
and I I just didn't understand why they

254
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:50,110
were laughing at I just didn't

255
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:51,310
understand what was funny I'm sure he

256
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:53,410
did something cute or something like

257
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:54,760
that hey I have a very distinct memory

258
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:58,860
on that and I think I was only four

259
00:10:54,760 --> 00:11:02,829
years old or something ah that's better

260
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:03,310
1997 I ran something I ran it good job

261
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:05,529
Felix

262
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:07,120
there's been Florida on a jet ski that's

263
00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:08,709
cool right I remember they said there

264
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,839
were sharks out there so you have to be

265
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:13,870
careful this guy did not give a [ __ ]

266
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:15,790
about that I thought this is funny

267
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:18,010
because I clearly stole this from the

268
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:20,440
library of Gothenburg and I think this

269
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:24,040
is before I had cut went over to Mars

270
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:27,699
yeah I'm sorry Gothenburg library I'll

271
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:31,839
return it one day a course in Italian 68

272
00:11:27,699 --> 00:11:34,420

276
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:45,339
entertaining for you as it was painful

277
00:11:41,199 --> 00:11:47,399
for me had a really good upbringing I'm

278
00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:50,140
very privileged and happy I had it and

279
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:52,240
you know if I had to go back maybe I

280
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:54,459
would change a couple of haircuts you

281
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,230
know maybe a couple things would be

282
00:11:54,459 --> 00:11:58,420
different but overall I'm pleased with

throne where T is the game to play

296
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:52,720
