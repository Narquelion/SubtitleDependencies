[Music]

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,969
we all have bad ideas I know you for

3
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,800
example clicked on this video how's it

4
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:18,660
going everyone my name is Peter Pan and

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,460
today we're looking at don't fund me of

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,760
people that have bad ideas and then

7
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:26,640
decided I need money for this bad idea I

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,490
mean am I gonna put my own investment

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,439
into this yeah I don't really feel like

10
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,690
doing that I just believe in the idea

11
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,940
too much to put my own money in it so

12
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,980
let's see what people ask for money for

13
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:41,190
here we have a GoFundMe page for

14
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:43,350
I would like $3 for some green beans and

15
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:45,360
he got five well done

16
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:47,700
see gamers it's that easy you want some

17
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,760
green beans you can count on the

18
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:53,550
Internet to be there for you Wow should

19
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,320
I pay for racing my own children no I

20
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,610
don't really feel like doing that I

21
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,190
think the internet should do that

22
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:02,609
because as you all know raising a big

23
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:05,129
family is expensive you can help we all

24
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:06,689
know it's expensive so therefore you

25
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:09,810
should pay me what it is the push

26
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:12,330
thought version of logic my body

27
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:15,000
oh my body builder has been injecting

28
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:17,610
oil to make them bigger but now wants to

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,909
raise money to make them smaller begging

30
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:23,009
for UK surgery to reduce biceps I think

31
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:25,650
there's a good you look just like a B in

32
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:28,229
lessons so that's how she did it huh

33
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,220
that's how she got those games it all

34
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:31,829
makes sense now

35
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:34,590
I didn't say anything it looks natural

36
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:35,820
of course what am I talking about but

37
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:38,460
you know it's not just poor people

38
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,740
asking for money everyone needs a bit of

39
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,979
extra money like this televangelists

40
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:46,200

Dimas fly commercial Oh God

45
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,229
I believe that if the Lord Jesus Christ

46
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:04,920
was physically on the earth today he

47
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:08,610
