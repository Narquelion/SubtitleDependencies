00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,350
needed to do to fix the telltale games

12
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:07,520
this is remove all the animations and

13
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:11,160

00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,130
the full context here is that he went

50
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,740
into a bathroom he filmed inside a

51
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:49,350

63
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:11,670
clearly people know there's a camera I

64
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:13,530
don't really see a problem in that all

65
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:14,430
right if you go in their bathroom with a

66
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,890
hidden camera

67
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:20,609

78
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:57,090

been in so many good Phelps late wasn't

81
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:03,030
that great why is he not credited there

82
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:06,180
it is Sherlock Holmes

83
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:08,280
Gnomeo and Juliet hey this man signed a

84
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,900
contract seven years ago

see this is thing they did with actors

86
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:13,500
right if they want to do a sequel I

87
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:18,630
think they're contracted to it most

88
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:27,180
likely he was only one week away from

89
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:30,130
