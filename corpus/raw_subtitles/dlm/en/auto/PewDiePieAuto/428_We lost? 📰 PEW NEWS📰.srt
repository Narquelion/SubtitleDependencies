mercury that is available on a limited

26
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,500
time only I guess that's the only way to

27
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,930
for this channel to survive another ad

28
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:25,320
pocalypse if everyone buys at least 10

29
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:27,360
pairs then maybe I will survival now I

30
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,549
had pocalypse - why are people talking

31
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,090
about this why are ads pulling away from

32
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:35,640
YouTube to understand this very complex

33
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:37,350
situation we need to go back yeah the

34
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,390
way I first heard about this was in

35
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:41,460
regards to another channel called girls

36
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:44,430
Couture Club which we will not show

37
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:46,079
there no pictures for those of you don't

38
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,329
know girls Couture is a YouTube channel

39
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,920
it's kind of like a modeling agency I

40
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:52,470
don't think at least it's just a group

41
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,880
of them young girl models now if you

42
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:57,420
check out their channel page the most

43
00:01:53,880 --> 00:02:00,119
popular videos are all bikini related so

44
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,670
already that's kind of disturbing and at

45
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:03,240
the same time as people pointed out that

46
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,720
this

47
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,789
Cannell exist to regular family friendly

48
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,039
I think at least gaming channels got

49
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:13,800
shut down by YouTube out of nowhere

50
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,750
saying so my channel just went down for

51
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,239
Community Guidelines strikes for sexual

52
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:20,190
content y'all into Pokemon or something

53
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,739
that's right mystic seven who uploads

54
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:24,360
pokemon gold videos got his channel

55
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:26,310
terminate him same thing happened to

56
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,140
violence Ki bum 94 woke up with my

57
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:31,230
youtube channel terminated great

58
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:33,660
fantastic bielski you upload clubpenguin

59
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:35,549
video so people started wondering why

60
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:38,040
did this happen is it because there has

61
00:02:35,549 --> 00:02:41,040
CP in the title CP which of course in

62
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:43,830
Pokemon memes combat points but in other

63
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,280
terms it could also mean add a file no

64
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,680
wait

65
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,650
cat porn and then you have Club Penguin

66
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:52,400
which stands for CP as well as pointed

67
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:53,819
out by Emperor lemon YouTube vs CP

68
00:02:52,400 --> 00:03:00,180
pokemon goat

69
00:02:53,819 --> 00:03:02,640
no Club Penguin bikinis ah YouTube logic

70
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,230
everyone now this doesn't necessarily

71
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,830
have anything to do with the ad

72
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,930
pocalypse

73
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:09,390
but I think it's important for context

74
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:12,269
after all now I don't know where this

75
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:14,640
guy name what it is Matt what it is made

76
00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:16,739
a video and he talked about how YouTube

77
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,260
is facilitating the ad sexual

78
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:22,829
exploitation of children and it's being

79
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:24,329
monetized parentheses 2019 always

80
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:26,489
helpful to know what year it is

81
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:28,230
so what Matt pointed out was that if you

82
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:30,630
click on videos on YouTube a certain

83
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:32,910
type of videos you will eventually enter

84
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:35,430
this click hole where YouTube will

85
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:38,160
recommend to you videos of really young

86
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:39,720
girls wearing skinny clothes or maybe

87
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,670
doing gymnastics or something like that

88
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,859
the more you click on it the more those

89
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:45,750
videos will be recommended to you and

90
00:03:43,859 --> 00:03:47,400
I'd be lying if I said I was surprised I

91
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:49,859
mean this is how it works on YouTube

92
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,569
YouTube wants you to stay on the website

93
00:03:49,859 --> 00:03:53,280
as long as possible so the way the

94
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:54,870
algorithm works is that if you watch a

95
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,480
certain type of content for a long time

96
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:59,549
YouTube is going to recommend more of

97
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,680
that content to you now the irony of

98
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:04,109
this is that YouTube's algorithm has

99
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,049
been serving pedophiles videos of young

100
00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:08,670
girls I mean it's not funny but it's

101
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:10,260
just messed up another thing Matt

102
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:12,479
pointed out was that if you check the

103
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:14,579
comments on these videos there's a bunch

104
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:16,829
of people writing kind stamps now this

105
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:18,780
is a way for people in these pedophile

106
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:21,539
rings to help each other out to find the

107
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:23,759
explicit sexually explicit part or what

108
00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:25,590
can be interpreted as such in these

109
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,629
videos now these videos in Sutton in

110
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:29,310
themselves are just innocent videos of

111
00:04:27,629 --> 00:04:31,139
girls they're not doing anything in

112
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:33,210
particular but there might be like that

113
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:34,770
one point where maybe they show a little

114
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:36,360
bit more or something like that and

115
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:38,819
through the youtube comment section

116
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:41,310
people find those parts more easily

117
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:43,139
models have pointed out how the

118
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:45,960
hypocrisy that these videos are actually

119
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:47,639
monetized as well showing ads on them

120
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,620
and the Apocrypha being that YouTube's

121
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:51,479
constantly be monetizing its creators

122
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:53,849
while serving ads on this type of

123
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:55,469
content it's kind of annoying but I

124
00:04:53,849 --> 00:04:57,750
think there's a bigger issue at hand

125
00:04:55,469 --> 00:05:00,509
here which is of course this clickhole

126
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:02,490
of videos now up until this point I'm

127
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:04,590
completely aboard with Matt and I agreed

128
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:06,210
like this is just completely disgusting

129
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:08,759
something obviously needs to be done

130
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:11,129
about this but somehow this whole thing

131
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:13,199
became let's try and get ads to pull

132
00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:14,909
away from YouTube and let's try and make

133
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,659
that happen and then I think what I'm

134
00:05:14,909 --> 00:05:18,000
gonna do is I'm going to start

135
00:05:15,659 --> 00:05:20,219
contacting McDonald's and things like

136
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,020
that if you go to my video YouTube is

137
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:24,389
facilitating the sexual exploitation of

138
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:27,090
children in the description I've

139
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:29,879
included all the social media contact

140
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:32,219
information for every brand that appears

141
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:34,020
in my video and will I it worked

142
00:05:32,219 --> 00:05:36,210
advertisers started pulling out from

143
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:39,120
YouTube because of this now a lot of

144
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:41,129
people asked why is pulling ads from

145
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,379
YouTube stopping pedophiles well

146
00:05:41,129 --> 00:05:45,930
obviously it doesn't it might raise more

147
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:47,430
awareness or urgency to YouTube but

148
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:49,020
other than that it just seems like

149
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:51,120
you're just gonna hurt everyone on the

150
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:53,669
website it's there is it the right way

151
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,789
to go about it now a side effect of this

152
00:05:53,669 --> 00:05:59,099
became that not just advertisers pulled

153
00:05:56,789 --> 00:06:01,110
up courts but channels that uploaded

154
00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:03,180
family-friendly content with their kids

155
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:04,830
in it got their videos to monetize

156
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:06,900
Jessica balling ever who pointed out

157
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:08,460
that the videos of her five-year-old son

158
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:11,669
got the monetized

159
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:13,319
and not just the monetized but she all

160
00:06:11,669 --> 00:06:16,289
the comments on these videos were

161
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:18,569
disabled as well YouTube responded to

162
00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:20,490
this saying that out of abundance of

163
00:06:18,569 --> 00:06:21,470
caution some videos that include minors

164
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:23,900
and

165
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:26,000
at risk of predatory comments may have

166
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:27,650
comments disabled this is only related

167
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,050
to content that may invade your minors

168
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:31,760
more info they also recommended that if

169
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:33,350
you have videos with minors in them you

170
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,870
should hold off comments and review

171
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:37,790
which honestly seems pretty sensible if

172
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:40,400
you ask me YouTube also said that they

173
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:41,780
terminated 400 channels and reported

174
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,030
illegal comments to the law enforcement

175
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:47,000
which is great but people were furious

176
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:49,400
people were genuinely outraged saying

177
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,290
this is the end of YouTube because of

178
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,790
this response that YouTube made with

179
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:54,380
regards to the action that we've taken

180
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:56,660
even if your video is suitable for

181
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:58,700
advertisers inappropriate comments could

182
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:02,570
result in your video receiving limited

183
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:04,880
or no act so comments on YouTube could D

184
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:06,830
monetize for the Creator which seems

185
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,360
pretty crazy if you think about it and a

186
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:10,040
lot of people who are not happy about

187
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,050
this saying YouTube is now officially

188
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,940
the monetizing videos in the comments

189
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:15,950
section how easy it is now to rekha

190
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:17,810
YouTube verse career just leave insults

191
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:20,510
on their videos and they get punished

192
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:23,660
for it and a lot of people echoed this

193
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:25,190
sentiment basically going well so what

194
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,870
you're saying is that if I'm powerful

195
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:29,090
enough troll I could single-handedly

196
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:30,620
destroy someone's livelihood and you

197
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:32,840
don't see anything wrong with that I

198
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:35,630
think for the first time in a long time

199
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:37,669
I'm on the side well YouTube this is

200
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:39,919
obviously a swift and short-term

201
00:07:37,669 --> 00:07:42,410
solution because people like Matt who

202
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,419
just want to see the site burn and are

203
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:46,310
contacted advertisers and doing all this

204
00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:48,260
stuff to to just cause as much damage

205
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:51,229
and havoc as possible they obviously

206
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:53,900
need to act quickly the videos that got

207
00:07:51,229 --> 00:07:56,630
demonetized from Jessica are gymnastic

208
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:58,520
videos of a five year old I'm sorry but

209
00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:01,390
maybe you can live without them being

210
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:04,070
monetized it seems kind of questionable

211
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:06,010
already even if they are advertiser

212
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:09,229
friendly given the circumstance

213
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:10,790
obviously they could be problematic I

214
00:08:09,229 --> 00:08:12,680
think I have the right to talk about

215
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:14,210
this because pretty much exact same

216
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,669
thing happened to me there's in a

217
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:18,590
different context of me making jokes

218
00:08:16,669 --> 00:08:21,050
okay it's not the exact same thing but

219
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:22,490
basically I made jokes about Jews and

220
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:24,410
then you had actual aunt who sent my

221
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:26,330
taking it seriously and that caused a

222
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:28,520
bunch of problems for me and

223
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:32,380
it's kind of similar in a really weird

224
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:35,660
way it's annoying how minority of

225
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:37,849
disgusting idiots are causing so much

226
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:39,950
problem but that's the reality of the

227
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:42,200
situation I think there's a larger issue

228
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:43,760
at hand here where it goes back to the

229
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,320
beginning with the girls Couture stuff

230
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,390
where you have girls in bikinis very

231
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,130
young what do you do with that are you

232
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:51,260
gonna allow that to be monetized from

233
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:53,000
now on and where do you draw the line on

234
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:55,280
that it's family-friendly no longer

235
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,890
family-friendly hmm they're not setting

236
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:59,450
a precedent by removing comments or de

237
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:00,950
monetizing these videos it's not

238
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:02,660
something that's gonna affect everyone

239
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:05,420
on the site it's clearly something

240
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:07,280
they've done just to act swiftly at a

241
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,840
time when it's necessary and to be

242
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,600
honest I appreciate that YouTube does

243
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:14,210
that so before everyone freaks out and

244
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,520
see YouTube is over no it isn't calm

245
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:18,770
down they are working on and I trust

246
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:20,750
that they are actually now something

247
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:24,020
worth actually getting outraged about

248
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:25,850
the sub gap PewDiePie versus T Series

249
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:28,220
now obviously I'm completely impartial

250
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:30,110
in this matter I don't care who wins or

251
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:35,270
comes down on top t gay

252
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:37,880
t gay but last night the sub gap closed

253
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:39,970
now of course viewer discretion is

254
00:09:37,880 --> 00:10:00,890
advised what I'm about to show you is

255
00:09:39,970 --> 00:10:03,790
extremely disturbing that's right these

256
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:06,350
series you thought you had me the job

257
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:10,030
YouTube those slides son of a guns

258
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:12,950
decided to delete 20,000 subscribers

259
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:16,910
immediately from my channel the sub gap

260
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:19,360
was at 22,000 and then very quickly they

261
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:22,820
took over T series actually past

262
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:26,180
PewDiePie in subscribers for 10 minutes

263
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:28,490
ten excruciating painful minutes but it

264
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:31,010
was necessary because now they got a

265
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:33,710
taste of what it means to be number one

266
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:36,350
and that's all you're ever gonna get TV

267
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:37,390
series they meant nothing because you

268
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:40,209
know what happened

269
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:44,950
even must came down from the sky and

270
00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:49,209
hosted me review and now the sub gap is

271
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:51,430
at 55,000 and PewDiePie is rightfully at

272
00:10:49,209 --> 00:10:53,560
number one again I'm not supposed to

273
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:55,000
give my opinion on that of course but he

274
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:58,140
deserves it goddamnit

275
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,820
Nix News Reggie the CEO of Nintendo
