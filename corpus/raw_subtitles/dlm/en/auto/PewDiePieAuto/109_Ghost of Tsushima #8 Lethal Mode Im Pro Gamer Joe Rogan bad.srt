1
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:59,840
am i alive

2
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:59,840
my internet went down

3
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,840
it was like the lord

4
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,000
what up gamers

5
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,960
can you see me

6
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,040
i gotta confuse her for a minute

7
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:44,880
what time is it for you [ __ ]

8
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,880
speedy time right answer

9
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:57,040
only correct answer

10
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,719
i wanted to stream yesterday i didn't

11
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,479
have time

12
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:05,520
i had a very annoying day yesterday

13
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:08,000
where nothing was going the right way

14
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,039
i know boo hoo me so i thought i'll

15
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,120
stream today instead

16
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,560
even though today technically not the

17
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,360
streamer day

18
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,360
but i thought uh why waste a day away

19
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,080
when you can be playing video game

20
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:23,440
that's right

21
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:26,879
joe rogan you were wrong [ __ ] you

22
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:30,560
video kept getting claimed yesterday

23
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,560
and i don't understand why

24
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,879
this is one of those annoying companies

25
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,480
that i won't

26
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,480
understand fair use i guess

27
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,360
so shank is a really [ __ ] good video

28
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,200
we'll wait to see if

29
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,480
we can get it released my toes are

30
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:53,280
shaped like beans

31
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,800
that's funny marcha thinks i have ugly

32
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,440
toast but i think my toes are

33
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,360
like peak per peak physique like

34
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,760
perfection

35
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,200
i never i guess like i never looked at

36
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,920
other people's toes

37
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,840
so i always use my own toes as like the

38
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,120
pinnacle of

39
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,120
what toes should look like

40
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,959
so i had the perfect toes but basically

41
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,840
what i'm saying

42
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,840

time tetris

53
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,560
every day if you could only play one

54
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,280
game for the rest of your life what

55
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,640
would it be

56
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:15,840
that's the real question isn't it try

57
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,840
lethal difficulty there is

58
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:32,240
how do i change difficulty

59
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,720
my beans toes voices are better no shut

60
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,919

62
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:40,479
but i have the best toast this is a fact

63
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,080
fact of life

64
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,080
you can try i have to

65
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,040
when do i change the settings

66
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,720
gameplay maybe let's try lethal

67
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,720
death is always close at hand a single

68
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,080
sword strike is lethal

69
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,080
i like that that's cool

70
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,880
if i could only play one game for the

71
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,840
rest of my life

72
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,840
what game would that be

73
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,160
you'd think it's a game that you can

74
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,240
just get really good at

75
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,479
maybe chess but then i have someone to

76
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,560
play against

77
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,160
like something purely gameplay-based it

78
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,120
had to be i got fired today because i

79
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,840
chewed on

80
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,479
shoot a guy out for using the girls

81
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,600

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:35,199

all right one two

88
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:07,280
no i died oh i didn't die i thought

89
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:09,759
lethal was like you died of one

90
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,759

91
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:21,840
is it did i not set on lethal

thank you thank you finally people know

100
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:59,120
how to work this

101
00:06:54,479 --> 00:07:02,479
properly and not always just roast me

102
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,560
i have feelings

103
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,960
why am i so dumb i changed the settings

104
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,039
two seconds ago it was in game play

105
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,720
it isn't lethal death is always close at

106
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,919
hand a single sword strike is

107
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:17,840
lethal so it's more implying it i could

108
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,840
die from one third strike

109
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,080
you play minecraft you guys are playing

110
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,599
minecraft i guess that makes sense

111
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,440
but man you get [ __ ] sick of

112
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:28,840
minecraft after a while i guess

113
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,319
no because it's creative and it's up to

114
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,400
you

115
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,599
that's a tough one man yeah i guess

116
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,599
minecraft you could sink

117
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,520
you could sink some hours into

118
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,120

119
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,599

is such a long game

190
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,600
and i honestly didn't mean to do it i

191

it has a lot of cool ideas with it

00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,840
very shallow and forgettable

00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,840
unfortunately

361
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,080

362
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,080
of it but

363
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,000

e-girls

574
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:19,599

575
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:20,640
was affecting his life

576
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:21,839
like it's kind of thing where you kind

577
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,440

578
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:23,920
like haha simp but it's also like you

579
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,119

580
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,480

581
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:30,560
what a [ __ ] loser if anything i

582
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,079
respect that he was talking about it

583
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,400
and he talked about how he overcame it

584
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:39,119
thanks to his girlfriend

585
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:39,119
she uh she helped him like recognize him

586
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:46,240
it helped him monitor him so he wouldn't

587
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,800
don't like monitor his bank accounts and

588
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,800
stuff like that

589
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:58,000
simping is an actual illness

590
00:35:54,480 --> 00:36:01,359
who would have thought serious we've

591
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,200
been making fun of it this whole time

592
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:05,040
i wonder if the fact that it's such a

593
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,720
stigma to be a simple is like

594
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,240
actually causing more harm because

595
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,359
people get addicted and then they can't

596
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,640
get out of it and they don't

597
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:13,440
they don't want to admit it to other

598
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:15,440
people so they can't get help

599
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,040

663
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:16,000
sometimes i can't tell if i'm crazy or

664
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:17,920
if i'm going through a mid-life crisis

665
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,160
it's like i genuinely don't want these

666
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:24,000

667
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:26,560
they're so important but i don't wanna

668
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,560

nothing has value anymore

00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:47,040

675
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:49,040
know it sounds super

00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:37,040
other people's reaction to his opinion
