to a video that even my mom sent to me

00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:18,060
so you know it's pretty important what

6
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:22,080
Indians think of PD PI versus T Siemens

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:25,019
so far the Indians have been quiet their

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,960
voice have been silenced I assume by

9
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:30,990
t-series themselves but now thanks to

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,030

00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:39,840
let's just find out what the Indians

14
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,940
feel about it hi

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,620
it's Chris from Asian boss even with all

16
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,719
the serious tensions between India and

17
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,460
Pakistan at the moment the online world

18
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:49,980
appears to be more interest in their

19
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,930
battle for YouTube supremacy as they

20
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,840
should I don't know actually I don't

21
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:55,410
know but they should this is what really

22
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,020
matters

23
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:01,020
okay worse are no longer fight through

24
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:04,830
soldiers and mercenaries they're

25
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:06,630
fighting through nine-year-olds we're

26
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:09,210
talking about PewDiePie versus t-series

27
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:11,729
the question is do Indian people even

28
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:13,830
know who PewDiePie is how big is

29
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:15,810
t-series in India our Asian boss

30
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,490
reporter Manisha hit the streets of

31
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,979
Mumbai to ask these hard-hitting

32
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:23,610
questions these are hard hitting

33
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:25,530
questions yes finally we will know I got

34
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:30,299
I'm actually nervous have you heard of

35
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:32,549
the brandy series yes obviously yes I

36
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:35,009
don't know if I like how they refer that

37
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:36,689
obviously okay I bet most people find

38
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:37,350
out about tea serious things to me

39
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:39,689
anyway

40
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:42,150
if anything TC should be thanking me

41
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:43,890
viewers who might not be aware of these

42
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,939
theories can you briefly explain what it

43
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,850
fresh

44
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:50,280
their tribe music company we distribute

45
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:52,230
music albums and songs t-series the

46
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,320
biggest

47
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:58,190
you know database of all I thought I was

48
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:01,170
gonna say biggest youtuber but no no

49
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:03,390
their intro database that's right there

50
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:06,690
yep see instead of primarily music and a

51
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:08,790
lot of it is the favor of India okay it

52
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:10,770
is a music label which makes original

53
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:13,290
music oh is that what they do they make

54
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:16,140
original music very interesting I

55
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:17,970
thought you know they just copyright and

56
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,450
other people's music that's really

57
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,940
strange

58
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:23,370
how often do you come across these

59
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:25,770
series is a huge it is it it is a huge

60
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:28,500
brand actually most of the talk songs in

61
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:30,750
India are made by t-series I think it is

62
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,490
it has the biggest market share in with

63
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:35,790
the music industry in this country that

64
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:37,830
sounds awful by the way one one company

65
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:40,590
making all the music for India don't

66
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:44,100
like the biggest channel right now from

67
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:45,420
India that's right from India they keep

68
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,670
leading up to something

69
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:49,410
but no it's the biggest channel from

70
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:52,020

00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:17,459
watch TCS on a daily basis and I know

83
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,350
for a fact that one of the biggest

84
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:28,110
YouTube channels in the world is TCH an

85
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:30,620
emphasis on one of okay why do you think

86
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:34,909
the series is so big Ananda

87
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:37,819
oh okay first of all like the YouTube

88
00:03:34,909 --> 00:03:41,360
algorithm alright

89
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:43,159
this kids this kid knows what's up it's

90
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,580
the YouTube algorithm that's all there

91
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:45,709
is

92
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:48,799
I like this kid finally someone speaking

93
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:50,930
some truth here okay before sleeping be

94
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,700
videos Rd right if they come up they

95
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,379
pose like 20 minutes a day YouTube it's

96
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:56,480
like oh yeah we need to purge this no

97
00:03:54,379 --> 00:03:58,579
human being can push to any videos a day

98
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,010
is the only advantage they have on me

99
00:03:58,579 --> 00:04:02,599
catches on they come up with music that

100
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:04,579
people really like so

101
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:06,590
that is the basic reason okay fair

102
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:08,569
enough alright I don't want to keep you

103
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:10,220
know something on t-series I I can

104
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:12,680
acknowledge that they do make music

105
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:14,599
videos I I will acknowledge that they

106
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,970
make videos Pete is keeping me in a

107
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:19,699
musical life giving the newcomers a

108
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:21,380
chance in India because music connects

109
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:23,600
the whole world that's what I understand

110
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:26,060
any kind of art form connects the old

111
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,060
boys it's like [ __ ] lasagna connected

112
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:32,120
literally everyone even Indians are on

113
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,630

I just realized tea service is a music

116
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:41,300
company and we absolutely stomp them by

117
00:04:37,849 --> 00:04:42,590
making a song that actually makes it

118
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,389
even funnier I never thought of it

119
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:46,460
because it's been closed for the longest

120
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:48,380
time yeah that's right a long revelation

121
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:50,840
when it comes to their quality of videos

122
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:53,780

123
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:56,030

00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:19,160
the baby

187
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:21,200
the only reason I'm not subscribed to TC

188
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:24,680
reason because I don't want 20 videos a

189
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:27,380
day blocking - yeah damn right this kid

people that's a familiar with the major

197
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:53,030
online battle going on between DC's and

purify yes this is I mean don't do that

199
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:56,780

200
00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:00,170
don't condone that behavior whatsoever

201
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:02,360

00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:04,130
for like months now yes it everybody's

203
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,990

into it for views and everything I am

205
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:08,690
back what's your understanding of the

206
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:10,730
situation

207
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:12,830
so basically PewDiePie is right now the

208
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:16,010
most subscribed channel thanks righties

209
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:18,740

00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:25,490
you're wrong kid that's where you're

00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:26,960

strong okay

214
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,980
which they have in India it's like the

215
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:33,260
Battle of subscribers right now

216
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:35,720
PewDiePie has been campaigning to retain

217
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:37,879
his number one position but the series

218
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:40,040
is right behind him

219
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:42,290
I wouldn't say right behind I would say

220
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,029
like if I look over I'd be like at

221
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:47,540
whatever you know were you being chased

222
00:09:44,029 --> 00:09:49,310
by so yeah we all can relate and you

223
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:51,589

a yeah I can keep going it's fine

225
00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:55,189
that's how I would describe it but

226
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,769
that's just me of course so just for fun

227
00:09:55,189 --> 00:09:59,589
who are you more inclined to support in

228
00:09:57,769 --> 00:10:03,139
this life oh it's about to go down into

229
00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:04,790
support pcs damaged I don't want to say

230
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:10,639
I'm holding that above and position you

231
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:13,430
want ec yes more inclined to see their

232
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:16,850
antennas fill my childhood when I was

233
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:20,059
five or six years old and now I'm 24 23

234
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:24,800
then it's very good I need to fact-check

235
00:10:20,059 --> 00:10:29,029
this series when was teen series founded

236
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:31,459
it sounded like a lie 1983 okay fine

237
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:33,889
fine whatever like who's counting and

238
00:10:31,459 --> 00:10:36,379
though why not beautiful because I'm not

239
00:10:33,889 --> 00:10:44,930
interested in gaming at all and he

240
00:10:36,379 --> 00:10:48,490
called me I called t-series a business

241
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:51,529
idea okay bliss that's not even in it

242
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:54,290
I'm sorry I'm sorry

243
00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:59,149
come back to me I'm sorry for calling

244
00:10:54,290 --> 00:11:01,579
you bases I although foreign youtubers

245
00:10:59,149 --> 00:11:04,189
are on side of PewDiePie and I also I

246
00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:06,279
also inside a few jeepers because I

247
00:11:04,189 --> 00:11:08,750
don't like Theseus personally this

248
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:12,110
independent creator is still PewDiePie

249
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:13,759
so it doesn't make a difference and even

250
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:16,040
if he is not he's making the same

251
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:18,950
content it doesn't matter if he's like

252
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:26,630
above or below TC reason

253
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:29,180
not to me a dance this is so cool these

254
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:30,800
CDs is just for singing random videos on

255
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:34,040
the internet and becoming the biggest

256
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:36,980
you do plan on the bed but that doesn't

257
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:38,600
really you know isn't fair for PewDiePie

258
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:42,829
because he's been working so hard for so

259
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:46,730
long individual youtubers like PewDiePie

260
00:11:42,829 --> 00:11:48,860
t-series is a big corporation who have

261
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:54,320
they have like unlimited resources to

262
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:58,240
gain that's right I can't how can you

263
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,240
maintain his number-one position ok

264
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:04,190
just keep doing what he's doing right

265
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:06,320
now that it became de Beauvoir if I'm

266
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:08,600
really desperate I mean I'm not

267
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,180
desperate of course but let's say I was

268
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,740
desperate like what do i do then

269
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,480
t-series will have a good quality of

270
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:16,639
production but you can never beat what

271
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,589
PewDiePie other connection PewDiePie has

272
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:21,230
with his audience oh yeah much better

273
00:12:18,589 --> 00:12:25,610
than like anybody so that is why he is

274
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:27,350
popular see I do not like I do not like

275
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:29,080
not appreciated at first it's a good

276
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:31,660
thing that being an individual person

277
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:34,030
but then somebody at some point of time

278
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:35,620
started p-series alone - right it's just

279
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:37,630
not like it just came to be a big

280
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:38,980
cooperation it started but that's not

281
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:41,080
necessarily true

282
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:43,300
okay a lot of companies start off really

283
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:47,980
big they have investors they have a lot

284
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:49,300
of people a lot of capital okay so even

285
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:51,250
though being an individual it's a big

286
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:53,740
thing but being a politician I think is

287
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:55,540
your enough to you know carry - so do

288
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:57,970
you see him holding onto his number one

289
00:12:55,540 --> 00:13:01,090
position or will he be overtaken by TC

290
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:03,070
oh yeah I guess be overtaken versus

291
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:06,130
what because t series is becoming

292
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:07,780
popular and popular day by day so or

293
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:09,670
associating with more and more new

294
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:12,340
companies Bollywood companies I think

295
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:14,380
it's like it's very stylish to have like

296
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:16,000
a battle it's regularly the T series is

297
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:18,100
not the win because the Indian audience

298
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,050
is increasing so this model is from

299
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:22,060
India coming on the internet saying here

300
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:23,890
that t-series is going to win he does

301
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:25,360
not actually care about her tribal and

302
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:26,920
he's not doing it like he has no

303
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,930
personal grudges honesty series it's a

304
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:32,140
TKO I lost some people get it and some

305
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:36,040
people are like it's a barrel he called

306
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:38,080
me [ __ ] Sonia so if we cross him I

307
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,700
think it'd be tough to compete as an

308
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:42,640
individual you have a hard time if we

309
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:44,680
cross him and he become number one

310
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:47,230
t-series are still continuing to grow

311
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:49,030
because India geo whatever for a global

312
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:53,620
viewers who don't know what gos can you

313
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:56,560
explain basically geo is a Wi-Fi company

314
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:58,300
that's offering like Wi-Fi at really

315
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,850
cheap hours now

316
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:04,740
so like a lot of India is now suddenly

317
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:08,110
on online damn this kid is so smart

318
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:09,910
YouTube higher this kid okay so

319
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:11,350
basically India is getting internet

320
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:13,450
which is a good thing obviously I

321
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:15,370
wouldn't joke like oh that's so bad but

322
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:17,980
honestly that's terrible

323
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:20,850
so basically India is getting internet

324
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:23,320
and t-series dominates India obviously

325
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:25,750
with it as soon as you make an account

326
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:27,370
in India I tried this out myself

327
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:29,830
you'll just be blasted by t-series

328
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:32,890
videos they have a huge advantage there

329
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:38,020
but sooner or later they will run out of

330
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:41,440
Indians and there are forever infinite

331
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:44,140
nine year olds do you see YouTube as a

332
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,690
space where it's the platform for big

333
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:49,630
corporations to run ads or is it a place

334
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:51,430
for creators to you know create content

335
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:53,560
actually both if you create content

336
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:55,810
people are attracted and when people are

337
00:14:53,560 --> 00:15:04,870
attracted then you can earn money by you

338
00:14:55,810 --> 00:15:07,959
know showing ads YouTube is encouraging

339
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:10,029
a lot of creators in India and the

340
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:12,790
corporations are also using it for that

341
00:15:10,029 --> 00:15:15,880
business used to be a individual creator

342
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:17,850
content thing but now with like

343
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:20,319
monetization and things

344
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:22,569
definitely moving towards that's right

345
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:24,009
company saying and you might say you

346
00:15:22,569 --> 00:15:27,009
know what there's nothing bad with that

347
00:15:24,009 --> 00:15:29,170
and companies had the same set of rules

348
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:31,149
that applies to everyone else

349
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:33,879
but I think it's more a concern from the

350
00:15:31,149 --> 00:15:37,779
community of YouTube's been shifting

351
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:40,629
towards less creator focused for years

352
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:42,279
now and now seeing an actual company

353
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:44,230
taking over as the biggest channel

354
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:46,959
people feel like that's a a symbol

355
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:50,049
almost of losing that another touch of

356
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:51,819
the creator side of YouTube creators is

357
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:54,009
why people love YouTube and that's what

358
00:15:51,819 --> 00:15:55,989
created YouTube and I people want to

359
00:15:54,009 --> 00:15:58,360
protect that I understand that I don't

360
00:15:55,989 --> 00:16:00,579
think necessarily t-series is the fault

361
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,319
for all of it obviously that's not how

362
00:16:00,579 --> 00:16:04,480
it is but I think that's why especially

363
00:16:02,319 --> 00:16:10,299
people are so caught up in this battle

364
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:11,529
so interesting to watch this really like

365
00:16:10,299 --> 00:16:14,709
it there you go

366
00:16:11,529 --> 00:16:16,689
we used to get more content that we

367
00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:18,989
can't get now everything is getting like

368
00:16:16,689 --> 00:16:21,579
into the same algorithm like nervous

369
00:16:18,989 --> 00:16:24,160
1001 tt over quality that's what we're

370
00:16:21,579 --> 00:16:25,959
getting now so the battle was supposed

371
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,309
to be between PewDiePie versus t-series

372
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:29,290
but the narrative has kind of changed

373
00:16:27,309 --> 00:16:31,119
and moved towards India vs. PewDiePie

374
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:33,189
know what you have to say about that how

375
00:16:31,119 --> 00:16:35,259
it may be because of youtube I said a

376
00:16:33,189 --> 00:16:37,540
few things that I have heard a few

377
00:16:35,259 --> 00:16:40,290
Indians but it's ok no a few but

378
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:40,290
PewDiePie

379
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:50,389
that is very I found it mission vision

380
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:53,240
not people should follow these series

381
00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:58,240
not because only for the his

382
00:16:53,240 --> 00:17:01,069
I think these series have done a lot for

383
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:03,050
as for the country also someone in favor

384
00:17:01,069 --> 00:17:05,209
of what he said completely because at

385
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:08,000
the end I mean in general tourism lies

386
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:10,069
in to me the concept of nationality does

387
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,409
not come anywhere close to YouTube like

388
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:14,179
being an Indian I can support anybody I

389
00:17:12,409 --> 00:17:15,740
want it is my content it's not that

390
00:17:14,179 --> 00:17:17,390
Indian people only like this you know

391
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:19,429
true Indian people like PewDiePie

392
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:20,990
everybody like it's about the content it

393
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:23,059
is not at all related to your

394
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:26,209
nationality and getting patriotism

395
00:17:23,059 --> 00:17:29,210
