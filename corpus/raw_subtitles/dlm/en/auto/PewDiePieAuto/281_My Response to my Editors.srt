1

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:08,519
own editor my own flesh and blood have

3
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:12,570
conspired against me they made a video

4
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:15,330
behind my back called how to get into

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,430
Louie where they make fun of me well

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:20,039

00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:22,800
myself

9
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:25,080
bet you weren't expecting that huh

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,869
basically doing the work that I pay them

00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:39,480
had this new air set though it's a

16
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:42,450
little confusing which one is the real

00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,430
PewDiePie I can't believe I have to

18
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:47,280
react to this but let's see what my

19
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:59,010
editors have to say about me myself and

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,720
this one with him and I don't know who

71
00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:23,070
this person is but we don't want to look

72
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,610
at these because we don't want to see

73
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:28,530
Felix's face any more than we have to

74
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:30,810
yeah that's fair that's always something

75
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:33,570
negative about you it's not even about

76
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:35,640
all this is come on there's plenty of

77
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:38,910
positive things about the brats I see it

78
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:41,820
all the time on the subreddit okay fine

79
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:48,450
you're right hey what's this Brad before

80
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:50,519
pewds actually happy Brad now darkness

81
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:52,560
darkness everywhere see this is what

82
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:54,390
happens if you edit my videos for too

83
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,850
long why do you think I stopped alright

84
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:59,910
the fact that Brad one has lasted this

85
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:04,579
long no one would ever see that coming

86
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:04,579
we thought he would last six months tops

87
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:16,290
Brad like every time I see that I'm just

88
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:18,299
like okay oh my god they actually

89
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:21,690
admitted it themselves

90
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:24,510
we now have proof that they do cut it

91
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:26,500
out every single goddamn video after a

92
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:28,780
funny meme I say please

93
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,310
bread please don't cut this out it was

94
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:32,650
so funny and they deserve the

95
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:35,020
recognition well there you go

96
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:38,860
they cut it out god damn it three

97
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:42,360
reasons that your meme doesn't make it

98
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:45,820
into the why one is copyright content

99
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:48,510
content in it we can't use it so stop

100
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:51,340
using copyright content and then be like

101
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:53,950
because we can't use it because it's

102
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:55,900
copyright yeah I'm actually really glad

103
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:58,240
Brad said this another guy who actually

104
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:00,340
said it either we can't obviously we

105
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,890
can't use copyrighted content stop using

106
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:08,350
it thank you bright very cool and super

107
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:11,070
salty wines no any I feel like I'm the

108
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:14,620
third wheel to a party I wasn't invited

109
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:18,400
just outside or laughing at this the

110
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:21,270
second reason is because Felix doesn't

111
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:30,520
react to it like some of them he'll open

112
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:32,500
yeah I'm like alright listen I don't

113
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,060
have energy to react to every single guy

114
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,610
okay you know I don't have to make

115
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:40,620
excuses fight all of these people are

116
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:40,620
people that are gonna complain to me on

117
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,520
all right number two and three there's

118
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:52,960
the same thing all right sometimes I've

119
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,370
seen the means already because you guys

120
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,900
tweet them at me and then I don't have a

121
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:58,870
genuine reaction to it so I'm like a

122
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:02,080
frigate and in one of these every day

123
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:03,760
for years has sapped any level of comedy

124
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,640
out of me that I might be able to draw

125
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:10,810
from one of these things how do you

126
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:12,460
think I feel probably one of the main

127
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:13,150
reasons we're doing salty the whoa there

128
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:20,080
we go

129
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:23,260
the color correction I'm so bored of

130
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,950
seeing stuff I'm trying to make him look

131
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:27,160
bad

132
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:27,729
first of all okay let's just get one

133
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:32,140
thing straight

134
00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:36,520
he but he does not have you seen how he

135
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:39,669
flamed turns the camera on regardless

136
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:43,270
it's almost like I expect you the editor

137
00:06:39,669 --> 00:06:47,110
to frame the shot alright oh look you

138
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:49,240
actually did it here Wow good job but

139
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:51,759
that would lose quality like the quality

140
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,860
can get any worse anyway come on learn

141
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,930
color correction listen I know exactly

142
00:06:53,860 --> 00:07:01,900
how to color great I could make a Marvel

143
00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:05,380
movie you gave me enough time Here I am

144
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:09,250
spending thousands of dollars on epic

145
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:12,009
new camera I set it up I finally fix it

146
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:13,360
and they don't even color graded to be

147
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:14,800
fair I think this is my fault

148
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,990
I think I had the wrong settings and OBS

149
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:20,229
and I didn't realize but they didn't

150
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:22,449
correct we'd have a lot of time and if

151
00:07:20,229 --> 00:07:24,550
we do or don't color grade it we still

152
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:26,620
get paid the same amount for the same

153
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:30,789
amount of hours of work and either way

154
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:33,659
Felix won't probably even watch it hey

155
00:07:30,789 --> 00:07:35,919
that's not true but yes that's fair

156
00:07:33,659 --> 00:07:37,659
alright this one says Brad don't cut

157
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:40,979
this out oh it's one of these right

158
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:43,599
first of all why is he so done yeah

159
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:47,320
Fridays with PewDiePie

160
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:49,060
yes I've seen her before did you see

161
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:56,259
when he was trying to work out the bun

162
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:58,599
yeah the phone and I was like I thought

163
00:07:56,259 --> 00:08:01,000
my way of solving it was more fun and

164
00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:02,949
clever okay if you enter the numbers

165
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,930
they do different tones and it would

166
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:07,419
play the actual theme song that would be

167
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:11,860
clever instead of just this meme review

168
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:13,750
bullsh okay yeah I'm a dummy dub if

169
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:15,969
you're gonna go to the effort to be like

170
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:18,430
I could fix your color grading yeah at

171
00:08:15,969 --> 00:08:21,150
least make it more natural it looks bro

172
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:24,569
like actually make it more natural

173
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:26,460
actually make it more natural also same

174
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:28,900
orange

175
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,800
yeah that's maybe better color grading

176
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:34,180
you're right I'm sorry

177
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:37,120
stir blue George oh I can call her great

178
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:40,209
it's so easy also can't even call her

179
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:43,510
great saves face with his legs smhd I'm

180
00:08:40,209 --> 00:08:45,880
the real salty one with this as well

181
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:47,550
I've seen this man but I didn't edit

182
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:55,680
this you do

183
00:08:47,550 --> 00:09:00,420
