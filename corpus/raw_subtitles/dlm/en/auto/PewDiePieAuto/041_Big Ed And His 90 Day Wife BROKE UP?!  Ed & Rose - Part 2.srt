look a certain way and wanted to leave

23
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:54,420
the family house of rose because it was

24
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:56,969
not up to his standards is that a

25
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,170
chicken is that a chicken first I would

26
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:01,710
I read some comments from last episode

27
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:05,549
as well he looked like he escaped from

28
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:07,380
Club Penguin before this Oh God the

29
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:09,210
comments I wrote let's see I didn't say

30
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,100
it I didn't say it I love how she

31
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:15,720
preferred to shame her legs than kiss

32
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:17,640
him true it looks like he's cut least

33
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,799
shrugging his shoulders all right that's

34
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,200
just mean I did not like that come on

35
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,479
mad respect for the cameraman who take

36
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,950
it all seriously fair enough fair enough

37
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,189
all right let's get into the new videos

38
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:31,079
we now have a conclusion of what happens

39
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:33,570
with Rosa Ned what's gonna happen I

40
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:36,150
can't wait this is a restaurant and a

41
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:39,780
big edit rights protected the hotel and

42
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:43,740
told them I want the most romantic table

43
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:46,380
in this resort and my hope is that for a

44
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:49,229
rose and I to grow close that's romantic

45
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:53,909
I mean having that guy in the background

46
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:55,290
what you grow closer together and just

47
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:56,549
relax and just kind of be with each

48
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:58,500
other all right

49
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:03,630
maybe there's hope I just wanna take

50
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:06,390
this in right now just be with you Hey

51
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,430

00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:25,690
here you'll be beauty I'll be the Beast

54
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:30,320
he knows he knows you've been happy I

55
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:32,209
want my life see usually with these

56
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:34,270
TLC's there's at least from what I've

57
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:37,459
seen there's always like the gold digger

58
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:39,620
fiancee but for once or at least when I

59
00:02:37,459 --> 00:02:40,910
see this I believe her I believe that

60
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:43,580
she actually genuinely wants a

61
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:45,380
relationship with this monstrosity and

62
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:48,160
it's so weird to see how he's doubting

63
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:53,300
and just completely ruining it basically

64
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:58,610

66
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:04,070
a bit too soon okay maybe not the main

67
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:08,959
reason why I wanted to come here with

68
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:16,730
you was for us to really understand our

69
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:21,769

thing that's holding me back oh okay and

95
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:38,270
that is whether or not Rose was involved

00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:40,160
with her sister asking me for money why

97
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:42,380

in my heart that she's not involved just

134
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:43,139
by the way she reacted I'm feeling like

135
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:46,500
I can completely trust rose but I don't

341
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:36,890
heavily flawed and I think settling for

342
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:39,080
a guy that acts that in lies especially
