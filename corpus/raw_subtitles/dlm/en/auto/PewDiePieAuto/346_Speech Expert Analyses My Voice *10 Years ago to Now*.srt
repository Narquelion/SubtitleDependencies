money at people

48
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,280
i could do it i guess so that's a good

49
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,960
point and it's been like that for 10

50
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,759
years now i want to have a look at his

51
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,430

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,479
yes he's still the same guy so this is

55
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,879
going to be exciting this is his first

56
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,879
video

57
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,400
it's so weird i remember shooting that

58
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,560
video even

59
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,000
i have a distinct memory of it i don't

60
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,160
like it pewdiepie here

61
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,440

00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,640
pewdiepie it started off with it kept it

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,239
going baby

64
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,239
keeps doing that he's been doing that

65
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,720
for 10 years he's changing his voice

66
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:45,120
modulating it to a higher register

67
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,480
being that kind of playful guy i usually

68
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,160
take a break from all

69
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,760
electronics or whatever just because the

70
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,560
internet here is so did you see that

71
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,080
beautiful

72
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,080
double shoulder shrug

73
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,200
he's so analytical i love it this is

74
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,959
this is what i expected from the public

75
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,800
speaker what no public speaker

76
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,879
dating guy like he didn't analyze

77
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,599
anything it felt like

78
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,480
no one appreciates my double shrug

79
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,720
shoulder

80
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,599
that i've been i did that 10 years ago

81
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,599
and i was like

82
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,400
no one paid attention to it what the

83
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,720
hell man

84
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,480
that is a very very unusual thing that

85
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,879
public speakers and presenters do

86
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,959
and usually when they're synchronized

87
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,159
that is associated to being truthful in

88
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,239
what you're saying sometimes

89
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,480
really that's so interesting i had no

90
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,200
idea yes i am truthful

91
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,920
one shoulder shrug it can be associated

92
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,599
to not being entirely

93
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,200
truthful or honest about what you're

94
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:44,159
saying but obviously he

95
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,720
is double shoulder shrug or pewdiepie i

96
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,720
love it

97
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:52,000
[Laughter]

98
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,640
[Music]

99
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,720
pewdiepie self laughter did you hear it

100
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,959
it's been going on for 10 years

101
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,239
he is still doing it i can promise you

102
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,120
we're gonna have a look at the new video

103
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,879
in just a moment

104
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,040
it's very very comfortable the beautiful

105
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,720
thing with a with a self laughter like

106
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,400
that

107
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,840
is that it increases anticipation of

108
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:14,000
what's going to come and you think

109
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:16,479
oh so that's what i've been doing

110
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,600
he makes it seem so deliberate i don't

111
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:19,199
know

112
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,680
i think that whatever is going to come

113
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:24,880
is more fun so he is actually

114
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,880
planting fun in that smile

115
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,400
whether you want it that makes sense

116
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,560
actually i

117
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:34,000
got a job a support captain he's got a

118
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:37,440
job uh so you can call me captain pewdie

119
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,840
smoke him up in pewter you see that

120
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,199
what did i do now i did a little fake

121
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,410
pipe that's right

122
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,680
genius

123
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:48,080
[Laughter]

124
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,199
this guy oh my god i feel i feel so

125
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,720
flattered

126
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,800
embarrassed and epic at the same time

127
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,160
legendary prop and what's interesting

128
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,280
with that is that

129
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,479
this is him this is 10 years ago he is

130
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,120
not a public speaker he's not a

131
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,520
presenter

132
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,280
but even the professional ones they

133
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,280
haven't got to this level where they're

134
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,039
using imaginary props maybe they're

135
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,479
using props like this they're showing

136
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:13,919
something on stage

137
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,919
by using imaginary props

138
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,759
it's not in their repertoire add that to

139
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,280
your repertoire

140
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,039
it'll really enhance your public

141
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,080
speaking you can learn from me

142
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:26,720
10 years ago public speakers to be fair

143
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,639
like i don't know if he's just uh

144
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,840
buttering me up here so now i'm like

145
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,039
yeah well actually

146
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,520
but i do think that in the school i went

147
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,680
to they

148
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,720
really hammered in on public speaking a

149
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,639
lot

150
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,840
so i do think that helped a little bit

151
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,280
even though i look

152
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,280
back at this and i'm like dude this is

153
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,720
so terrible

154
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,840
oh you can go there and they'll be like

155
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,570
no i don't want to be there and i

156
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,320
believe you better [ __ ] go

157
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:52,160
[Laughter]

158
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,600
using roleplay as well he's gotten

159
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,880
better at this i think but using

160
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,400
different voices can i thank you

161
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,759
yes you're good now i'm going to go

162
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,240
there you guys are going to go there now

163
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,759
i'm going to go

164
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,759
there and whenever you're in a public

165
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,199
speaking situation use role play like

166
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,680
this with different kind of voices on

167
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,080
stage

168
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,360
oh it's amazing again it's a high level

169
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,240
public speaking skill

170
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,240
using gestures

171
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:15,540
[Music]

172
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,240
okay let's have a look at the filler

173
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,120
sound thing um

174
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,919
why is he doing it it could be of two

175
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,840
reasons i

176
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,280
believe that he's not aware of that he's

177
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,160
doing it the cool thing with filler

178
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,880
sounds is that

179
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,199
if they are functional i.e you want to

180
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,360
for

181
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,360
some reason make it crystal clear that

182
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,280
you're coming to a point or

183
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,800
that you you want to signal that you're

184
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,639
nervous you want a signal that you're

185
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,000
uncertain you want to signal that you

186
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,840
are super present

187
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,199
then you can add a filler sound

188
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,520
functionally for that

189
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,880
in all other circumstances just kill

190
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,000
them eradicate them

191
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,360
yeah i agree i i i find myself to want

192
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,280
to editing out the

193
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,960
um sounds a lot of times because it is

194
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,520
annoying but i it's interesting how he

195
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,280
points out

196
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,120
they actually do have a point they can

197
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,880
have a point which is kind of

198
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,479
yeah i never thought of that in your

199
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,160
signature scene

200
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,319
why does a man have a towel in the

201
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,360
background huh is that some public

202
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,479
speaking

203
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,840
trick what the it's got this very

204
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:18,319
deliberate background and a

205
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,199
towel oh oh that that's a public speaker

206
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,520
thing isn't it

207
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,039
he'll come out and be like oh at the end

208
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,000
of the video i bet you wonder why i have

209
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:27,360
a towel here

210
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,720
well you see they hate them

211
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,560
now i'm curious if that's gonna happen

212
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,080
in your head but

213
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,840
i want to keep uploading videos because

214
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,880
i think it's a lot of fun and i'm gonna

215
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,880
miss you guys

216
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,039
just look at this as soon as he says

217
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,639
i'll be missing you or he talks to us in

218
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,080
one way or another he tilts his head

219
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,560
just slightly a couple of degrees to the

220
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,160
left

221
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,840
we tend to do that when we want to show

222
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,080
empathy for something if your rabbit

223
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,840
died i'll go oh

224
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,360
it's so funny i would never have thought

225
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,120
of that he makes you seem

226
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,879
so smart for doing it when it's just a

227
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,000
natural human thing but he's like look

228
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,720
what he's doing

229
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,400
this is so great that's too sad why i

230
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,039
want to point this out this is because

231
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,360
this guy

232
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,080
is synchronized what i mean with that is

233
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,080
that there are

234
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,080
five levels of synchronicity in your

235
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,599
communication number one gestures number

236
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,720
two body language number three voice

237
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,479
number four

238
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,000
language and number one five facial

239
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,599
expressions if you

240
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,039
are i don't remember single one where

241
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:20,319
was the diagonal

242
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,840
five when saying something it increases

243
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,639
the credibility of whatever you're

244
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,160
saying this guy is

245
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,160
it's just a natural when it comes to

246
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:32,000
communication question is

247
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:34,959
is he still the same pewdiepie then

248
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,959

256
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,080
thing the same as he did

257
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,640
previously in 10 years ago it was

258
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,640
accident

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,600
pitch up as well tootsie's back on the

274
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:36,000
line so i'm posting my setup

god damn dude

276
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,440
did you hear that register increase

277
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,480
this is pewdiepie for us the question

278
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,839
then does he still have that

279
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,080
synchronicity going

280
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,680
damn dude that's cooler than my setup

281
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,360
that's not fair

282
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,720
this is freaking brilliant you know that

283
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,480
he's three times

284
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,920
displayed a sense of underdog or

285
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,160
displayed a sense of

286
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,279
weakness he did it now that's better

287
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:03,040
than my setup

288
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:04,480
yes that is better and all conspiracy

289
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:09,120
theories around me i am an

290
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:13,839
idiot admitting or showing a weakness

291
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,839
because i'm a beta i can't help it

292
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,360
look guys he's deliberately pretending

293
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,399
he's an absolute loser

294
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,240
yes of course deliberately increases the

295
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,640
level of serotonin in the other person

296
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,279
they they connect with you in a

297
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,560
different way

298
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,320
that's right you're welcome for the

299
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,200
serotonin guys

300
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,560
i'm so bad do you feel the serotonin

301
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,320
just

302
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,760
surging through your veins i don't know

303
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,920
where serotonin is

304
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,839
is it in your brain it's in your brain

305
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,000
you feel it in your brain

306
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,160
just laying yourself out there showing

307
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,920
that you are so much human that you can

308
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:51,600
admit your weaknesses like that

309
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:54,320
that really connects us to him

310
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,600
maybe that's part of his magic spice my

311
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,519
magic formula

312
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,079
we're a peaceful religion everyone will

313
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:02,880
join and anyone that doesn't will die

314
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,200
okay i'm not threatening but subscribe

315
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,880
no

316
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,880
bell notification come on 11

317
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,920
boom boom boom did you remember that hey

318
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:20,480
this is again imaginary props

319
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,480
that's my reaction

320
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,560
there is a skill called full out just

321
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,839
playing it full out

322
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,760
obviously spitting on yourself would be

323
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:37,279
defined as a full out

324
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,399
skill i feel like yeah damn uh first aid

325
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:42,160
kit you're welcome

326
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:43,920
saves life this is so beautiful

327
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,680
do you remember the video that he

328
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,399
recorded 10 years ago he had about 20 to

329
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,120
25

330
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,000
um filler sounds i would guess that

331
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,040
loads of those

332
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,880
were not consciously put there he is so

333
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,639
much more skilled he knows exactly what

334
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,600
he's doing it's like you've gone to a

335
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,160
presentation space

336
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,680
communication skills coach because there

337
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,480
are it's almost like i've been doing it

338
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,639
every single day

339
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,680
i think he's he's on point with the um

340
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,200
times

341
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,360
that's something i found about very

342
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,279
annoying and deliberately trying to get

343
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,040
out of i probably still do it a ton

344
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,880
though and scythe cuts it out basically

345
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,480
very few instances when you can add a

346
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,720
filler sound and this

347
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,680
is one example of those so look at this

348
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,320
he's using them

349
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,040
it's live uh the wrench uh you're

350
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,360

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,600
placed there i think we've nailed it

354
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,399

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:44,240
super humble in more than five different

359
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,399
ways did he show weaknesses during this

360
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,000

using visual effects and sound effects

369
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,240
he's using himself with different spicy

370
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,240
words changing language changing

371
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,360
voice he doesn't need anything more than

372
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,040
a camera

373
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,959
