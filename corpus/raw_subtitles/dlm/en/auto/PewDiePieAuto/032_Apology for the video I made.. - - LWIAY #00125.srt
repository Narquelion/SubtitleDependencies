38
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,110
ignorant but I've learned and I spent

39
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,070
the last couple days trying to better

40
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:43,110
myself I've gone to therapy and

41
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:46,620
apparently apparently Swedish pancakes

42
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:48,540
are just European camp pancakes and I

43
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:53,400
assumed that they were Swedish pancakes

44
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:55,260
because I grew up making them what the

45
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,390

368
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:12,180
a big role in who I am today I've had a

369
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:13,410
rough childhood when I was started my

370
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:15,480
parents sent me to boarding school this

371
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:16,980
I stayed there for five years it was

372
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,950
quite a rough school and there was no

373
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:22,920
cell phones or Internet

374
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:26,280

378
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:38,760

380
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:43,020
