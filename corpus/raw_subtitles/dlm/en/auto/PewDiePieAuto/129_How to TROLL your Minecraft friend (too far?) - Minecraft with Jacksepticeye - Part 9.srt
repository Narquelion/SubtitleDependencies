00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,430
good morning gamers okay Jack and I are

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:07,890
about to record we're on the survival

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:12,870
world what Jack doesn't know is that I

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:15,540
spent an hour setting up traps pranking

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,680
my minecraft partner epically if you

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,410
think this is not fair

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,480
remember to two or three episodes ago

8
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,630
Jack pranked me okay

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,340
I was digging one of the trees and he

10
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:28,980
removed the ground so I couldn't reach

11
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:32,070
far high enough so therefore I have set

12
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:34,050
up a couple traps now how do you trap an

13
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:37,590
Irish person well it's simple you leave

14
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:39,329
signs let's say potatoes this way our

15
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:42,390
first trap is actually my favorite one

16
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:44,309
it says pull for potatoes I put it far

17
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:48,180
in so he will actually go in all the way

18
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:50,730
he will fly up there a piston will stick

19
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:54,809
out so here we'll be stuck in a room

20
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:56,280
full of obsidian sadly you can't push

21
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:58,890
obsidian because otherwise he'd be

22
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,809
filled with an entire room but it you

23
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:03,120
know I'll just show you so you pull this

24
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:04,769
and the floor activates underneath for

25
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,630
you and he's gonna be super confused

26
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:09,600
he's not gonna know what to mine and

27
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:11,460
then I'm gonna tell him hey mind the

28
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,830
floor jack and he's gonna be like oh

29
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:16,350
okay cool and then by the time he

30
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:18,240
figures out to mine the bottom he's

31
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,830
gonna fall all the way down there's

32
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,330
water don't worry there's water on the

33
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,930
ground because I want to prank him on

34
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:26,310
more stuff now that's trap number one

35
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:28,770
wait that's not great oh god I almost

36
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,900
fell in my own trap let's reset it now

47
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:54,659
floor but little does he know this one

48
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:55,200
actually activates that's right dynamite

49
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,409
