1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:08,519
Lord gang floor welcome to Wakanda the

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:10,980
Utopia the greatest place on earth so

3
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:13,040
this is my place in Animal Crossing if

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,599
you're not familiar with Animal Crossing

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,910
I'm sure you know someone that's been

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,490
obsessed with this game lately I saw my

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:22,380
Chet play this and I was like that's the

8
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,980
dumbest that's the dumbest thing I've

9
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,150
ever seen

10
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:31,050
no one's know we're never gonna play

11
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:33,270
that game but she convinced me to

12
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:36,540
download it and yes I am hooked yes I

13
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:38,340
love it so this is my city this is what

14
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,660
Conda welcome to Wakanda please give me

15
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,850
free stuff if you're playing this game

16
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,469
and tell me what your turnip prices are

17
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,840
so I put these streets in I downloaded

18
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:48,809
the streets but I designed these yellow

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,690
ones so it's like Japan because I love

20
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:55,110
Japan I think it's pretty cool I try to

21
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:57,059
give it like a urban feel to it this is

22
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:59,550
one of the first items I have glorious

23
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:01,620
Statue of Liberty very nice so this is

24
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:03,180
actually my real character the problem

25
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,949
is I bought a switch light but you can't

26
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:07,200
record on switch lights I have to record

27
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:11,070
with this character it's so dumb got my

28
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,510
drinks if I need one it's all G fuel in

29
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,220
case you're wondering I think there is

30
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,020
actual G fuel in this game people I've

31
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:20,970
been liking me like G fuel and stuff I

32
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:23,189
feel like if I video makes no sense if

33
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:25,200
you don't play Animal Crossing but we

34
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:26,759
are going to visit my dad later I just

35
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,470
want to show off my island first so this

36
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,260
is basically it

37
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:33,960
I even try to get my mom to play this

38
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:36,930
game but she said that the characters

39
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,150
speak too annoying for her so yeah it's

40
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,610
not it's I like it I think it's cool

41
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,530
it's got a good feel it makes me feel

42
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:45,750
good this game is very very very

43
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:48,200
addicting these are my villagers this is

44
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:50,670
sherbert best friends

45
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:53,810
he's just pretending because I'm this

46
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:57,480
not my character this road ends here but

47
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:58,830
we're working on it basically I started

48
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:02,430
playing this pretty late so if you're

49
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:04,470
judging me it's because yeah I was late

50
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:06,420
I was a late bloomer in this game and

51
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:08,640
now I'm paying the consequences because

52
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,910
everyone is like years ahead this is the

53
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,650
beach here's our turtle he sells

54
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:15,360
seashells normally but I needed the

55
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,750
seashell so I took them from him his

56
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:22,050
name is Sven I'm just kidding can I

57
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:23,970
enter these by the way Oh sad alright

58
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,890
here's the duck I don't like him all my

59
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:27,900
villagers are basically sociopath

60
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:30,030
do you not normally just stare set the

61
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,850
grass and that's all he or she ever does

62
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:48,480
I don't know what it is to be honest in

63
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:50,130
here we have my animal crossing normally

64
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:56,010
she loves me okay it's cuz I'm someone

65
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:57,360
else whenever I hear might say used to

66
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,709
heart emoji which is playing with other

67
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,410
people I have to ask her where she's

68
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:03,090
doing it to I gotta be sure all right

69
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,450
let's put Brent we also have my house to

70
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:06,310
show

71
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:13,430
[Music]

72
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:16,340
who else do we have this game is like so

73
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:17,750
fun to play but it's so frustrating at

74
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:19,280
the same time if you played through

75
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:27,819
Easter you know exactly what I'm talking

76
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:33,590
about oh my god what an introduction

77
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:35,209
snakes hobbies is weightlifting a lot of

78
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:36,920
them are but it's funny he's also asking

79
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:38,780
me like what's your favorite workout and

80
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,239
then he judges me based on my work I'm

81
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:42,500
super weird it's really fun interacting

82
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:43,550
with the villagers in this game

83
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,650
for those who you don't know I don't

84
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:47,000
have a flag yet I'm not the white flag

85
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,700
is not what we're doing I know that's

86
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,510
kind of ironic to be what kind of it but

87
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:52,970
that's not what we're doing

88
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:56,930
oh yeah I have the weirdest villager

89
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:58,819
ever all he does is sing in the middle

90
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:00,650
of the night all grace is crafting cool

91
00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:06,080

well get to my house eventually this is

100
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,970

101
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:32,750
change the world like you get to move

102
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:34,370
water and make mountains and stuff so

103
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,440
I'm planning to put a house here and a

104
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,979
house here it's just that I can't do it

105
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,200
right now

106
00:04:36,979 --> 00:04:41,360
and I want everything to be symmetric I

107
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:43,610
spent so much time and money for

108
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,020
everything to be perfectly symmetric if

109
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:46,850
you don't put it perfectly the first

110
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:48,410
time if you're new playing make sure you

111
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:50,720
put it perfectly otherwise you're

112
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:53,539
screwed you'll regret it

113
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,229
don't listen to only one I got this rich

114
00:04:53,539 --> 00:04:57,110

00:04:54,229 --> 00:04:57,950
Klaus moving in so it's a different I

116
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:01,010
think there's a hundred different

117
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:02,780
villager so it's kind of fun seeing them

118
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:04,300
all I just got this lighthouse I know

119
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:07,630

120
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:08,710
this is my fishing bridge very nice it's

121
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:11,770

it's my house really it's so funny when

136
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:52,660
Jack told me about this game it was like

137
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:54,790
oh animal crossing you should play it

138
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:56,800
it's so fun and relaxing no wait it's

139
00:05:54,790 --> 00:06:00,070
not anyone that tells your animal

140
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:03,610
crossing is relaxing liar the game has

141
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:06,400
mortgage it has stock market so these

142
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:08,380
turnips are basically the stock market

143
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:12,250
of the game you can't keep them in your

144
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:14,170
inventory that's yeah oh my god it's all

145
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:17,080
turnips yeah I'm I'm playing the turnip

146
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:18,700
game okay but just imagine that is

147
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,440
normally a really cool okay and then

148
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:22,630
don't even get me started on the stress

149
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:25,000
with eastern imagine you're playing an

150
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:27,730
RPG and you're trying to level up but

151
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,770
all the sudden the game introduces RPG

152
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:31,930
Easter mode and then everything that

153
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:34,840
gets you XP it's just cut in half

154
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:36,640
because instead you get eggs what are

155
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:39,310
the eggs do a bunch of garbage it's all

156
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:41,470
turnips basically for now please if you

157
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:43,300

158
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:45,040
