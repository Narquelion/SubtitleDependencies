guy

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,280
but what a lot of people don't know

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,399
about me is that i'm actually a

13
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,160
certified pilot

14
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,000
it's something i haven't talked about so

15
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,800
i wanted today prove to you

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,559
a pilot reacting to flight simulator

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,719
we're gonna fly to sweden here

18
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,039
uh we're actually already in sweden uh

19
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,680
we're flying at bowen 747

20
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,239
this is uh something i'm well familiar

21
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,039
with

22
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,680
to disengage the parking brake uh there

23
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,760
we go

24
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,879
we are now going to increase the

25
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,799
throttle

26
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:07,760
there we go we should be moving forward

27
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,080
very gently i definitely know how to fly

28
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,320
a

29
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,640
plane so this should be no problem

30
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,799
especially in the home turf of sweden

31
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,240
just so we're clear i am a pilot all

32
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,720
right i will now take off

33
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,759
on my own volition not the video oh god

34
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,119
we're flying

35
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:25,920
oh my god i am scared

36
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,200
throttle control we want to maintain at

37
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,320
about 30

38
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,360
no throttle is not listening to me

39
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:36,240
look at the fjords beautiful

40
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,600
there we go we are maintaining a nice

41
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,200
altitude and speed

42
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,960
we're flying the boeing 77 now we're

43
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,040
going to retract the landing gear

44
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,000
uh we're dipping a little bit we're

45
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,920
going to now

46
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,439
climb slowly for the passenger sitting

47
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,159
in the back we're going to climb to

48
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:52,320
slowly to about 35 000 altitude

49
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,680
and from there it should be smooth

50
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,520
sailing my dudes

51
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,040
why can't i adjust the throttle this is

52
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,020

53
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,479

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,880
images

175
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,000

why do i not like what just happened

184
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,400
so even the weather is simulated from

185
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,680
real life satellites so

186
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,199

187
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,039

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,560
brighton where i am right now we're

189
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,960

410
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,440
honest

411
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,320

412
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,519

417
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,560
just stare that way

418
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,760
there we go it's a little shaky it's

419
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,959
gonna be a little shaky because we're

420
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,120
adjusting course

421
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,399
it's fine shakiness is normal shakiness

422
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,800
is good get used to it

423
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,000
uh we're actually a little we burnt a

424
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,560
lot of gas

425
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,519
so did i forget to remove the flaps how

426
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,240

427
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,959
how do i oh god i got the flaps on oh

428
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,320
this is terrible

429
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,560
why didn't no one tell me about the

430
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,560
flaps bro there we go

431
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,560
oh that should be smoother what about

432
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,480
that those flaps are still out

433
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,760
you're not gonna die you're not gonna

434
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,760
die relax

435
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,519
you're one of those panicky people huh

436
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,800
we're gonna die there's a little bit of

437
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,800
turbulence

438
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,519
good betas uh what were they called

439
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:06,639
flaps f13 someone's at f13

440
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,600
i'm trusting you there's no f13 you

441
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,639
control

442
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:13,519
that does not exist there we go

443
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,320
there we go now we're oh that's so much

444
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,720
better

445
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,760
why did not tell me about that huh all

446
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,160
right we're we're fine

447
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,680
uh we're going a little fast according

448
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,240
to this but i think that just means

449
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,240
we're gonna go

450
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,720
you guys hear that that's fine that's

451
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,079
normal

452
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,959
don't listen to him how do we shut him

453
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:34,399
up which button i'm slowing down relax

454
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,880
we're gonna have to emergency lane at

455
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:40,480
the huckfield airport our landing gear

456
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:42,320
is broken there's no reason to be afraid

457
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,720
my dudes you're in safe hands we're

458
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,959
gonna

459
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,560
just do a quick little pit stop we're

460
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:49,120
gonna have to lose some people

461
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,560
because i think we're too heavy and we

462
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,839
don't have enough fuel we actually

463
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,839
haven't gone anywhere

464
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,360
why is the autopilot so bad as soon as i

465
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:57,519
press the autopilot we just start

466
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,440
dying you're in safe hands we're flying

467
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,360

tournament

470
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,839
i think it'd be that stressful to just

471
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,839
[ __ ] fly i thought once you're in the

472
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,839
air it's easy

473
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,000
[Music]
