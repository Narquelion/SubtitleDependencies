hundred so don't even try and compete

12
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:55,050
with me because I am just too smart

13
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:58,500
thank you now of course we're going to

14
00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:00,510

must choose a sacrifice actually that's

23
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:25,820
not what's happening magicians use these

24
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:29,430
techniques such as to misdirection and

25
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:36,659
prestige it dictation to pull up these

26
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:40,829
illusions yes I know I am a nerdy this

27
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:44,070

tricky meme that not everyone will get

31
00:01:50,329 --> 00:01:57,600
those alcohol molecules and it's @y oh

32
00:01:54,180 --> 00:02:00,360
yeah I forgot you are studying art how

33
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,990
could you possibly know basic level dude

00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:06,240
everyone knows as H 1 H 2 O is we were

35
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:08,580
in the same biology contest last year

36
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,290
and you got fourth place then you got

37
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:15,340
butthurt and stormed off crying

38
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:17,319
I am very smart I got hired range in

39
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,129
biology and math than you or did you

40
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:19,930
forget

41
00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:21,519
oh no I remember I remember walking the

42
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:23,290
classroom during the lunch break and

43
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:25,629
hearing and seeing you begging the

44
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:30,690
teacher for the great because you needed

45
00:02:25,629 --> 00:02:33,549
for college damn someone heard this man

46
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:35,579

47
00:02:33,549 --> 00:02:38,890
get he just wanted to share a meme

48
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:42,819

51
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:56,139
is just pathetic this song has somewhat

52
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:58,359
of a 90s vibe that's actually a common

53
00:02:56,139 --> 00:03:00,579
misconception the paradigm inherent to

54
00:02:58,359 --> 00:03:02,829
the post modernist fallacy of a priori

55
00:03:00,579 --> 00:03:07,930
knowledge stems from a systematic

56
00:03:02,829 --> 00:03:10,930
predilection to binary diatom I imagine

57
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:12,519
anyone being like this in real life you

58
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:14,920
know they spent a lot of time writing

59
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:17,319
this down making sure ok let's now add a

60
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:20,799
predilection to binary dictum and these

61
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:23,049
don't die Co Tommy's cuz I have these

62
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:25,870
pictures were taken just two years apart

63
00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:29,139
hash tag stop Meegan's vegans are eating

64
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:31,510
all our glass we need them to stop we

65
00:03:29,139 --> 00:03:35,109
need to stop that it's called going to a

66
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:38,139
different biome it's called a joke lmao

67
00:03:35,109 --> 00:03:41,019
oof got him okay yeah I know but I tend

68
00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:43,989
to be too logical for my own I am so

69
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:46,900
smart that I'm just too logical so when

70
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:49,959
I am wrong I am actually not wrong I am

71
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:54,190
too logical you can't compete with this

72
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:59,109
power instead of saying mother-fricker

73
00:03:54,190 --> 00:04:04,780
you can just say oh they put half our

74
00:03:59,109 --> 00:04:07,510
generation wouldn't understand yes you

75
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:09,970
are right the thousand of notes on this

76
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:12,909
pose prove how ignorant our generation

77
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:15,879
is only you are intelligent you are the

78
00:04:12,909 --> 00:04:19,979
chosen one only real ancient Greek kids

79
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:22,680
would understand reblog if you were true

80
00:04:19,979 --> 00:04:28,020
650 BC kid

81
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:30,380
ancient Greek was 2600 years ago this is

82
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,380
embarrassing

83
00:04:33,949 --> 00:04:40,169
shut up I'm very smart

84
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:48,270
okay I know I am just too logical for my

85
00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:49,020
own good I'm moving up my bed me in the

86
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,880
morning

87
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:52,259
cats are actually you know when they

88
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,710
were used to work actually you know you

89
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:56,880
get worried about the hit by the fattest

90
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:59,970
smart bomb but I like to call it

91
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:02,400
actually crepuscular which means they

92
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:04,199
are also quite nocturnal animals using a

93
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,000
cat to represent you is not a big deal

94
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:08,280
it's catching if they read that that's

95
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,710
all I hear from you you dumb balls okay

96
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,660
how about this no one giving this I'm on

97
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,530
the size of aliens now now that I've

98
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:19,250
proven myself

99
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:23,460
s T f you I am smarter than you how

100
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:26,460
mathematics surrounds me I see numbers

101
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:28,979
everywhere what the does that even show

102
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:31,220
pouch to me it's your dick PI inches

103
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:31,220
long

104
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:38,789
you just got ins my only masturbate

105
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:42,210
mentally my thoughts are so intricate

106
00:05:38,789 --> 00:05:45,320
that they can make me her and I love

107
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:53,639
that I don't believe in physical

108
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:58,860
masturbation my mind makes me don't make

109
00:05:53,639 --> 00:06:02,010
me think it oopsie nah he's trying to

110
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:05,720
hold his brain in as his mind gets blown

111
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:08,760
to be fair those are fairly trivial

112
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:14,990
equations although I'm sure impressed if

113
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:18,210
at the time explain them too blurry I

114
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:19,770
guess I cannot actually see them this is

115
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:22,139
how you know someone is truly smart

116
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:24,000
because when confronted with their

117
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:27,000
statement they contradict themselves

118
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,840
entirely which is the best way to prove

119
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,330
your point

120
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,990
this is also cringe everyone else said

121
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:36,910
to 10:30 I guess I'll watch

122
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:39,620
me at twenty ten thirty sees video about

123
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:42,410
hyperbolic functions wait what

124
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:49,310
such a thing damn it now I have to watch

125
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:51,530
it hashtag if math is your curse then

126
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:54,650
smash like subscribe on this video only

127
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:57,140
true math Lords will understand I asked

128
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:59,810
my cousin if he liked the book I lent

129
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:02,420
him did you ever end up enjoying

130
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:04,630
hyperspace I liked it a lot first

131
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:07,640
disclaimer I don't believe your own

132
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:10,910
Bullivant election thought to understand

133
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:14,330
my theory in its absolute form so I

134
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:17,270
dumped it down what a great way not at

135
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:22,490
all condescending to speak to someone I

136
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:25,550
have to write it's so great how this is

137
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:27,490
real it's annoying when people write in

138
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:30,860
whatever I don't know how to say that

139
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:34,760
just take the extra two seconds and

140
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:38,390
write out is not the same thing as or is

141
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:41,840
not equal to you similar it Neanderthal

142
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:46,310
how about writing two instead of using

143
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:50,419
two you quazy literate quasi literate

144
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:52,010
ken is a great test if anyone delivers

145
00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:54,169
that one to you there's no recovery

146
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:57,020
that's how you know you're not just very

147
00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:59,780
smart but very super smart we have two

148
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:03,530
Wi-Fi channels one is 2.4 gigahertz and

149
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:06,860
one is 5 gigahertz I really want to name

150
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:09,620
them who are you and I am you but

151
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:12,830
stronger technically if you did so it

152
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:15,979
would be correct the 5 gigahertz channel

153
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:18,229
is able to support more devices on its

154
00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:21,700
channel due to it having higher

155
00:08:18,229 --> 00:08:25,250
bandwidth that and it's a more modern

156
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:29,300
implementation into routers I know

157
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:31,520
that's why I made the job just pointing

158
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:35,479
out in case you didn't figured you might

159
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:38,060
learn something clearly I understand how

160
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:39,769
the frequencies work well enough to come

161
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:43,349
up with it

162
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:46,080
just in case you randomly made a joke

163
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:50,730
and didn't understand your own punchline

164
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:53,519
I you are welcome I am very smart iboga

165
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:56,730
bro Kapoor the two highest IQ scores

166
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:59,070
ever recorded belong to women unusual

167
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:01,529
you know you know someone just couldn't

168
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:05,700
handle this considering I've never met a

169
00:09:01,529 --> 00:09:08,240
woman smarter than me well that's a bit

170
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:10,260
unfair considering I never met a man

171
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:14,700
smarter than me either

172
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:16,529
Oh God Jesus Christ how do these people

173
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,970
