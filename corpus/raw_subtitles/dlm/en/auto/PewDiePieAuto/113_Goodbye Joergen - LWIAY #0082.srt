00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:40,940
go back to the village with the stuff

303
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:43,400

try to sleep in the nether then

312
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:05,600
realizing he was genuinely interested

313
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,940
and curious about it and that he was

314
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,610
just trying to have fun playing the game

315
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:13,519
we feed bang him to play

316
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:16,339
and we betrayed his trust making him

317
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:18,649
lose most of his inventory make him at

318
00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:21,110
least a little sad deep down inside that

319
00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:26,420
because of that he might not be as

320
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:28,189
excited about my listen I didn't think

321
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:30,319
it would explode I thought maybe like a

322
00:13:28,189 --> 00:13:32,540
gas or something would appear in my face

323
00:13:30,319 --> 00:13:34,670
and there would be a jump-scare and sure

324
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:36,230
it was a jump-scare right anything I

325
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:39,049
would just die instantly

326
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:41,269
