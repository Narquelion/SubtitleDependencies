what the other portal is okay so where

900
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:58,089
did you end up now the same one again

901
00:41:55,690 --> 00:42:00,730
okay so if you go back you come back

902
00:41:58,089 --> 00:42:02,140
here on my way back I was just going to

903
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:07,990
run through the nether again probably

904
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:10,869
died oh no did it respawn respawn

905
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:13,660
see this is why I made you go wait I

906
00:42:10,869 --> 00:42:16,000
mean you just get infinite obsidian yes

907
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:18,970
but it's not that rare how do we fix

908
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,160
they to be can't we yeah I think once

909
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:23,230
we're in the nether we have to go as

910
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:24,910
close to this coordinates as possible

911
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:26,859
and that's the only way like and then

912
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:29,260
build another portal and then then then

913
00:42:26,859 --> 00:42:30,910
the link up it's okay I can do it well

914
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:32,650
luckily we got enough obsidian for

915
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:34,210
another one okay I'm on my way back I

916
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:37,029

closing my eyes and think of you but

920
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:46,250
