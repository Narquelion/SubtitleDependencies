scares then yes it startles you in the

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,230
beginning but after a while it gets a

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,789
bit repetitive but it's out for VR as

8
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,769
you can tell by my headset and it

9
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:24,390

00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,630
fazbear entertainment has developed

22
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:17,850
something of a bad reputation over the

23
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,830
last few decades and while it's true

24
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:22,549
that some stories associated with our

25
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:25,770
name were loosely based on actual events

26
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:28,020
jority of them were occasions from the

27
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:32,670
mind of a complete lunatic lawsuit spin

28
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:34,500
right but we ourselves ha ha ha that's

29
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,320
why we have recreated many of these

30
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,450
completely fictitious scenarios that

31
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:43,860

00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:46,110
years into a hilarious VR game I can
