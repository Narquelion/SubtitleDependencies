in the beautiful can you tell I used to

19
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:12,250
sit down here basically down there I'm

20
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:14,200
not on the floor I'm sorry I'm sorry I

21
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:16,390
thought I'd do a random update video cuz

22
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:19,000
I haven't I didn't know what to film and

23
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:21,250
I thought there's a lot of changes like

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,960
new camera why is he doing that

25
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:25,840
what's happening it felt like a good

26
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,060
time okay so grab your favorite G fuel

27
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,429
and let's do this

28
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:33,610
why am I not on the floor Felix well the

29
00:01:30,429 --> 00:01:35,489
answer might shock you I don't like how

30
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:38,349
my back hurts from sitting on the floor

31
00:01:35,489 --> 00:01:41,530
it was a good meme I'll probably return

32
00:01:38,349 --> 00:01:43,840
at some point but for now it's nice it

33
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:46,690
chairs are ok I feel ashamed just saying

34
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:50,950
that just the way that came out I don't

35
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:52,509
deserve this tambourine the reason I'm

36
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:54,310
here again is because I caused a

37
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:56,610
quarantine basically we're more

38
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:58,750
comfortable in this location and I

39
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:03,550
didn't want to pack my camera because

40
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:06,160
it's huge so I'm using myself a hundred

41
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:07,509
million subs subscribe please I got a

42
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,550
new camera coming that it's a little

43
00:02:07,509 --> 00:02:12,430
smaller I order one online so don't

44
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:14,200
worry ok I'm not this is not the

45
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:16,420
standard even though it should be I mean

46
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,280
look at this it's beautiful looks like a

47
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:20,110
shitty webcam I've been really enjoying

48
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,090
making videos lately I hope you guys

49
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:23,620
like them as well and especially doing

50
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:25,390
the live streams I'm so glad I'm

51
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:27,310
live-streaming lysa bus check it out

52
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:30,060
it's so fun we had some great moments

53
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:32,370
where you guys trolled me

54
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:37,680
me not remembering what the characters

55
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:39,360
names are I don't know the interaction

56
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,360
that with the chat and playing a game

57
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,190
has been really fun and it everything

58
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,170
about membership and live streams has

59
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:47,849
just taken me back to old school to

60
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:49,410
YouTube where I feel like I'm I have a

61
00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:52,230
closer connection to an audience and

62
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:53,849
doing laia lets place again which is

63
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:56,250
something that I've always been very

64
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:57,870
scared of doing because less place is

65
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:00,090
such a huge commitment for the channel

66
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:02,040
there's so many uploads and once you

67
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:05,700
start one you have to finish it like I

68
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:07,049
always do I finish all my games and a

69
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,359
lot of times there's a huge disconnect

70
00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:11,040
between your audience and what you enjoy

71
00:03:09,359 --> 00:03:12,989
sometimes games are fun to play but

72
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,609
they're not fun to watch and it's hard

73
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:15,840
to find games that fit both but I feel

74
00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:17,519
like with live streaming it doesn't

75
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,769
really matter we can just have fun

76
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,540
anyway lots of us a lot of people like

77
00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:24,720
it last of all a lot of people who can

78
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:26,989
hate it either way it's it's been fun to

79
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,040
play it so I'm really happy about that I

80
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:30,989
look forward to do more

81
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,269
let's place in the future some more

82
00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:35,099
gaming stuff this channel was originally

83
00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:36,630
a gaming channel that's what I always

84
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:38,549
seen this channel but it's sort of

85
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:40,290
progressed and into do all kinds of

86
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:42,720
different things I feel like I've made

87
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:44,849
every video possible at this point but

88
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,500
and I always felt awkward like there's

89
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:48,989
so many people subscribe to this channel

90
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,639
for so many different reasons and I

91
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:52,470
never know what to do with the gaming

92
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:53,940
stuff and now I feel like yeah I figure

93
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,440
it out I'll livestream it it'll be

94
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:57,630
really cool let's see I had some

95
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,840
questions this is like a video I made

96
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:03,389
like back in 2011 on a shitty webcam I

97
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,799
prepared some questions like the first

98
00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:06,450
riders would PewDiePie hey should we

99
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:11,489
call this Friday or some PewDiePie let's

100
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:12,750
yeah hey guys okay Luke asked do you

101
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:14,370
think you'll do more or less plays like

102
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,900
you're doing Last of Us because I'm

103
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:17,340
really enjoying the two to three hour

104
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,900
live streams well that yeah yeah

105
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:21,989
basically yes I've already answered that

106
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:23,880
goes some tsukushi my next I think after

107
00:04:21,989 --> 00:04:25,680
and terraria of course we're not giving

108
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,150
up on that because I finish all my games

109
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,330
thank you very much

110
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:37,139
are you going to live go some sushi

111
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:39,990
Tsushima you yes again looks fun so yeah

112
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:40,910
I mentioned in a video that very briefly

113
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:43,700
that me and marks everything

114
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:47,270
moving to Japan we have a house there

115
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:49,100
now and due to quarantine we can't go

116
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:51,230
there there's a lot of different reasons

117
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:52,640
why I don't really feel like everyone

118
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:54,830
needs to know every single nuance of

119
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,940
that detail but that's I'm planning

120
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:59,240
we're planning to go there in the future

121
00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:03,860
sometime whenever we can this is very

122
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:06,160
very very complicated will you do a

123
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:07,910
review of the Last of Us part two I

124
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,620
personally would love to hear your

125
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:11,270
opinion about it when you finish because

126
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,890
your channel got me buying a PlayStation

127
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:14,990
4 and to play last time whether what

128
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:19,010
part well that's funny it's such a

129
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:22,160
polarizing game and it's a god I hate it

130
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:24,110
so much not not the game at this point I

131
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,760
just hate how people are just losing

132
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:29,060
their mind over this game either people

133
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:31,220
are defending it to death like notes you

134
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:33,590
just hate it because you hate women or

135
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:36,800
or if you like it then there's something

136
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:38,330
wrong with you it's like who cares I

137
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,580
think there's a lot there's so much

138
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:43,220
politics around it and I haven't seen

139
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:44,750
anyone really discuss it properly but I

140
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:46,190
need to finish the game first I might do

141
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:48,500
it afterwards because I think the

142
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:50,840
politics has a lot of decisions on what

143
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:53,240
drove the story in terms of personal

144
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,800
decisions but I can only speculate when

145
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,570
are you bringing out more music you

146
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:01,130
hinted there was something a while ago

147
00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:02,870
but nothing came Wow well me and Dave

148
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:04,640
have been working for a long time slow

149
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:07,490
down a bit because of quarantine but

150
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:09,830
more it is coming I think we have a lot

151
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:11,540
but we want to make sure it's good so it

152
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:15,320
might take a while it might take a long

153
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:17,210
while which i think is fine I but yeah

154
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:19,010
if I'm not live-streaming it probably

155
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,390
means I'm working on music it's been

156
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:22,130
really fun I'm glad I'm doing that with

157
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:23,600
Dave since your streaming partnership

158
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:25,040
with YouTube happen to me and things

159
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:30,250
appear to be in good terms is there any

160
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:33,320
hope for scare PewDiePie season 2 got it

161
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:35,510
it's been so long ago at this point I'm

162
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:37,790
just like whatever who knows

163
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:39,770
Never Say Never right I don't know only

164
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:42,200
the future can tell I feel like it's

165
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:44,480
been so dated now that if it came out

166
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,760
now it just it wouldn't even make sense

167
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:48,440
I think for the sake of people working

168
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:51,260
on it it would be nice to get a

169
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:53,150
conclusion but who knows could you do

170
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:54,260
more vlog like content I think a lot of

171
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,760
people would be interested to have a

172
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,620
peek

173
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:58,240
to you in Marcel's everyday life well

174
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:02,020
now during quarantine there's not much

175
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:04,960
to do every day feels I could say exact

176
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:07,210
same day I think once we're in Japan

177
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,370
yeah I would definitely love to do that

178
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:11,650
it's fun for memories too looking back

179
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:14,020
in old videos it's nice to have that log

180
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:16,630
so I think what once said this whole

181
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:18,850
thing is over hopefully soon yeah look

182
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:21,250
forward today this is a very chill video

183
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:23,200
how about that a lot of people have been

184
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,490
suggesting I do more philosophy videos

185
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,550
those have probably been my most

186
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:30,520
requested videos I don't like I can't

187
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:34,420
just make them hey I need to think about

188
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:37,080
it because they're so deep I need to sit

189
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:40,750
down in the forest for a couple hours

190
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:43,360
for days no it's just that if I have

191
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:44,950
something random that I feel like I'm

192
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,530
talking about I'll make a video about it

193
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:49,720
but I can't just decide to do it it just

194
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:51,280
sort of happens so even though they were

195
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,620
heavily requested which I really really

196
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,330
appreciate because the advice they do

197
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:57,190
terribly it doesn't matter because I

198
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:59,470
enjoy making them but I'm also glad that

199
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:01,240
a lot of people request them has the new

200
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:03,280
video schedule with brakes worked out

201
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,480
for you both in terms of how the channel

202
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,520
has been doing and how you feel about

203
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:09,490
recording videos channel is doing great

204
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:11,860
but I don't know on my day off so I

205
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:13,930
still tend to work on side projects and

206
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:16,000
other things like that and it's hard to

207
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:18,700
like people are already asking about the

208
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,220
music stuff and I shouldn't have said

209
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:22,540
anything

210
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:25,030
yeah I'm really bad at taking days off

211
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:27,910
hey that's on me really it's hard when

212
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:30,010
you enjoy it so much like in my day off

213
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:31,360
I would love to stream all day but I

214
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:35,349
also want to do other things in my life

215
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:37,599
as well but it's so easy oh I got a

216
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:40,030
couple hours free I'll go live that kind

217
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,460
of thing which isn't work anyway but I

218
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:44,590
think the five uploads a week is pretty

219
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:46,810
good it gives me time to reset the week

220
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:49,420
instead of everything just flowing into

221
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:51,220
one thing and I can kind of reflect on

222
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:53,080
last week what worked what didn't and

223
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:56,920
give more thought into it even though I

224
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:59,170
don't but I can if I want to okay geez

225
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,970
are you planning on reviewing or

226
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:02,470
suggesting any more books in the future

227
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:04,870
I always find your book videos really

228
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:07,810
interesting there we go again stop at

229
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:08,610
home just kidding thank you I'm still

230
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:11,640
reading just

231
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:13,680
as avidly as I used to last year or the

232
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,390
year before so I probably won't do the

233
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,329
same format I think I want to make a

234
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:20,820
video kind of explaining why you should

235
00:09:18,329 --> 00:09:23,010
read kind of like my workout video or

236
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:26,760
something I don't know I feel like

237
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:30,269
reading and working out has been the two

238
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:34,500
best changes I made in my life in terms

239
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:36,899
of personal growth and feeling good

240
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:39,450
about myself I feel like everyone should

241
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:41,700
do it and I want to inspire more people

242
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:42,959
to do it as well so if I can make that

243
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:45,000
into a video I think that could be a

244
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:49,079
really cool thing are you going to take

245
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,790
another break anytime soon I might do

246
00:09:49,079 --> 00:09:51,720
the January meme again honestly I've

247
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:55,200
been thinking about it

248
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:57,630
it was really nice I feel like it's fair

249
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,279
any other job you get holidays I don't

250
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:01,230
really do that and this year especially

251
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:03,440
has been kind of crazy so yeah I

252
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:06,240
probably do that in January to be honest

253
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,970
it was good for my mental health I think

254
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,620
they're like my fear is that even if I

255
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:13,260
enjoy myself I don't want my whole life

256
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,829
to pass by doing the same thing if that

257
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:16,260
makes sense

258
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:18,570
even if I love it you know I'm getting

259
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:21,480
old guys I'm 30 I gotta say I did not

260
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:24,420
expect me to sit here ten years later

261
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,199
from when I started no way this

262
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,510
is crazy

263
00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:29,699
answering questions things are so

264
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:32,820
different but still so so much the same

265
00:10:29,699 --> 00:10:35,370
it's kind of crazy what's important

266
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:37,769
about being a minimalist how to start

267
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:40,350
things it's funny cuz I sent all my

268
00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:42,240
clothes off to Japan so I had no clothes

269
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:43,800
I literally you can probably tell I'm

270
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:48,990
wearing like a black shirt in every

271
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:50,850
video or my own March I think I talked

272
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:53,250
about this a little before but I I think

273
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:55,920
the word means something different for

274
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:57,600
everyone for me it's just about caring

275
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,670
for the stuff I have I think you can be

276
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,110
the richest person in the world and have

277
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:03,120
all the items in the world but if you

278
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:04,589
don't care for what you have and you

279
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,029
have too much of it you're not gonna

280
00:11:04,589 --> 00:11:08,579
appreciate it and I think that's just

281
00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:11,339
the mentality to be thankful for what

282
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:12,750
you have to me at least I remember you

283
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:15,630
know Mark Zuckerberg wears the same

284
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:17,730
shirts every day and he said it it was

285
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:19,470
because he he needs to make a lot of

286
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:21,630
decisions in that way he doesn't have to

287
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,330
deal with it and that sounded so stupid

288
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:24,940
when I heard

289
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:27,430
but but now someone in my position that

290
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:29,320
gets so many questions every single day

291
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:31,600
that it's definitely real like the

292
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:33,820
fatigue of answering even small stuff

293
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:37,330
like stupid questions like that are nice

294
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:39,700
I'm still I can't deal with it sometimes

295
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:42,610
and Here I am answering questions how

296
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:44,440
ironic I think it's just being there in

297
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:46,150
the position I am people want things

298
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,490
from me all the time which is fine but

299
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:48,850
it just gets hard to keep up booooo-whoo

300
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:51,430
me

301
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:53,830
I know opinions on ninja and scare

302
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:56,110
situation if any I have not heard about

303
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:58,210
this and I'm very glad I haven't cuz I'm

304
00:11:56,110 --> 00:12:00,460
so tired of people's I

305
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:02,230
don't care like so I don't know what

306
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,850
this is about but it's like someone's

307
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:06,520
someone you is getting cancer all every

308
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:08,590
day today the earth is dying it don't

309
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,600
matter what does your new setup look

310
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:13,060
like that is a great question I'll show

311
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,860
a picture actually even better I can

312
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:18,310
literally just move this one camera can

313
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:21,190
I look at that yes I'm playing tat

314
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:24,640
Titans sue me this is my portable setup

315
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:26,740
basically fits in a suitcase it's

316
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:29,590
alright it works that's all he needs to

317
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:34,720
do it works any plans of dropping shoes

318
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:36,940
ooh who knows who knows wink wink wink

319
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,230
how are you doing these days oh why

320
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:41,470
thank you for asking

321
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:43,480
I'm doing really good I'm so happy I

322
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:45,940
feel like I finally came in terms with

323
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:47,380
myself realized not everything will

324
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:49,840
always be perfect you just got to be

325
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:53,410
happy with where you are I'm in a good

326
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:55,110
place anyway so I have every reason to

327
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:56,980
be but there's something I thought about

328
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:59,080
especially with all the drama that goes

329
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:02,170
on online there's always a new drama a

330
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:05,770
new topic and people just like small

331
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:06,940
things seems to be so big online and it

332
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:10,210
makes me feel like people are just

333
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:14,200
miserable like this is this is important

334
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:16,090
to you really it makes me feel bad I

335
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:18,070
feel like if I could change one thing

336
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:19,630
there were people to just be happier

337
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:21,850
because then people wouldn't get so

338
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:24,190
worked up over these insignificant

339
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:26,440
things all the time like people that

340
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:28,900
don't like Last of Us for example it's

341
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:32,980
like and and harassing the people that

342
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:35,740
made it I find it so baffling you start

343
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:40,279
going to be a co Kamel and dis track

344
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:42,920
yes the thing is I don't want it to fall

345
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:44,930
in the same meme as t-series where it

346
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:47,000
went too far even though I don't think

347
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:48,800
that was my fault I just don't want to

348
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,870
fall in the same thing if anything the

349
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,540
only mistake I made was to not kind of

350
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:56,389
end it sooner it's just for fun

351
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:58,670
literally a fun meme but I think it

352
00:13:56,389 --> 00:14:00,649
could be a funny video so yeah well I

353
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:02,420
collaborate with mr. beast yeah I think

354
00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:04,699
we talked about doing something together

355
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:08,089
at some point we do live very far away

356
00:14:04,699 --> 00:14:09,949
so we'll see do you have to clarify you

357
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:14,660
are joking every time you make an NG

358
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:16,610
joke clearly yeah I do people think

359
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:19,579
clearly take jokes out of context as

360
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:22,160
weapons against them so yeah I feel like

361
00:14:19,579 --> 00:14:24,199
I really have to it's super stupid but

362
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:28,550
that's the world we live in it is what

363
00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:31,610

my closet are you guys impressed wow

366
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:37,310
it's so dark this is not lit up there we

367
00:14:36,949 --> 00:14:41,410
go

368
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:44,000
it's IKEA built it myself

369
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:48,199
designed it myself the layout on the

370
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:53,949
online IKEA thing measured it yeah it's

371
00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:56,720
pretty epic here or here underwear socks

372
00:14:53,949 --> 00:14:58,420
always have the same brand of socks do

373
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,889
not have different brands of socks

374
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:02,569
biggest life hack of all time saving

375
00:15:00,889 --> 00:15:04,370
underwear they're the same brand because

376
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:06,319
your junk and your feet needs to feel

377
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:08,240
the same way every day never wear

378
00:15:06,319 --> 00:15:10,550
different socks because otherwise they

379
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,529
get lost in laundry you're welcome

closet tour done you're welcome do you

387
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:34,370
like golf as much as aadmi I actually do

388
00:15:32,569 --> 00:15:37,490
play golf I played a ton as a kid I

389
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:39,740
think my handicap was like 17 which

390
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:42,199
isn't it's decent I have a really good

391
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:44,870
swing actually I'm pretty proud of it I

392
00:15:42,199 --> 00:15:46,459
just like the focus my dad is really

393
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:48,380
good at golf we played last time he was

394
00:15:46,459 --> 00:15:49,100
over in UK was really fun do you ever

395
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,260
consider

396
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:53,420
retiring from YouTube I think I did more

397
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:56,150
last year but after my break it kind of

398
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:59,300
gave me some time to understand which

399
00:15:56,150 --> 00:16:01,040
part of it I'll enjoy and that I just

400
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,450
want to focus on that it's crazy to

401
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,100
think how you entertained so many people

402
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:06,350
on a daily basis but how do you imagine

403
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,400
the long-term future of current YouTube

404
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:08,930
are you planning on learning YouTube

405
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,310
until you're very old or what do you

406
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:11,420
think you move on something new at some

407
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:13,580
point we have to think how many

408
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:17,600
youtubers now we now watch will be 50

409
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:19,640
sometime in the future bro well like I

410
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,650
said earlier I didn't expect to even be

411
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,430
making videos now so anything is a bonus

412
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:25,190
I'll take you

413
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:27,050
yeah I remember a few years ago hearing

414
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:30,610
someone was 30 and did the YouTube is

415
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:33,040
like what dude you're too old for this I

416
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:36,920
think it's changing YouTube is changing

417
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:38,780
it's gonna keep changing you never know

418
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:41,330
what's gonna happen and that's part of

419
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:43,250
the fun I think I can't answer this

420
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:46,520
question to be honest I think it's gonna

421
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:48,770
be similar to TV stars or TV or things

422
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:50,810
like that longer careers exist it's just

423
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:52,250
how it is be honest are you actually

424
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:54,290
enjoying thinness and ferb or is

425
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:56,030
something that feels forced I enjoyed

426
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:57,860
them it's been really fun to watch them

427
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:59,390
during the live streams if you can in

428
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:01,340
case you didn't know we watched one

429
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:05,480
episode at the end of each live stream

430
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:07,700
it's not my favorite cartoon but I enjoy

431
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:10,880
that you guys enjoyed so much I think I

432
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:12,920
prefer gumball more to be honest sorry

433
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,660
Phineas and Ferb fans if I had to watch

434
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,730

435
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:18,350
