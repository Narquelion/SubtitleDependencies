Japan ready assigned a moderator to the

188
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:22,680
subreddit people are using this clip to

189
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:25,589
kind of compose conspire against him

190
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,719
because I've been saying I don't I

191
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:30,089
didn't assign him or whatever and in an

192
00:08:27,719 --> 00:08:31,709
ideal world there would be no moderators

193
00:08:30,089 --> 00:08:34,110
and people can just post whatever they

194
00:08:31,709 --> 00:08:36,449
