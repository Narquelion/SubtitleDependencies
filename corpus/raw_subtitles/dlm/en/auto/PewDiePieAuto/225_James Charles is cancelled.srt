Almighty 1.4 million subscribers

27
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:45,020
breaking records in losing subscribers

28
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,210
faster than anyone has ever gained

29
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:51,770
subscribers so what happened well

30
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:54,470
youtuber totty totty totty made a video

31
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:57,920
called by sister a clever play on words

32
00:01:54,470 --> 00:02:01,010
because James Charles slogan is hi

33
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:05,860
sisters and she called it bye sister

34
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:09,470
[Laughter]

35
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:12,170
now this video is 43 minutes long so I

36
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:15,140
did the favor of watching it for you

37
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:17,930
you are welcome Jesus Christ can you not

38
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:19,910
make it any more or less concise 43

39
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:22,400
minutes you expect everyone and people

40
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:23,990
know James Charles already he's pretty I

41
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,690
think most people in the beauty

42
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:28,730
community kind of the yes are really big

43
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:30,380
but in the beauty community but James

44
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:33,560
Charles is one of those figures that

45
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:35,480
kind of people know about him at least

46
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,820
and I think that's why this just got so

47
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:39,830
massive so what did she say well she

48
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:41,450
starts off by showing how they've been

49
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:43,459
friends for a long time and she's been

50
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:47,209
supporting James Charles for a long time

51
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:50,030
is here to do my Bridal makeup which is

52
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:52,340
what I am wearing right now I just

53
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:54,650
wanted to congratulate you on almost a

54
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:56,630
million on Instagram I want to say huge

55
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:57,950
congratulations to James Charles if you

56
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:59,120
have not checked his channel out on

57
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:02,299
YouTube all right we get it

58
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,950
she talks about why this video happened

59
00:03:02,299 --> 00:03:06,560
in beginning like why she's calling out

60
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:08,870
James Charles buddy it's very confusing

61
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,580
unless you know what happened you're not

62
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:12,080
going to understand anything of a I'm

63
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:14,420
gonna share a lot of it with you because

64
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,940
I feel at this point that I have to

65
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:18,769
because Gabriel's more I decided a prett

66
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:20,480
what does that mean I don't understand

67
00:03:18,769 --> 00:03:23,890
that God do I have to watch how many

68
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:27,410
videos have to watch I love him and I

69
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:28,970
therefore this kid so ruin through so

70
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:31,190
she's been supporting game for a long

71
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:34,730
time then she talks how Fame has changed

72
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:38,390
James Charles Fame power and a fat bank

73
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:40,310
account will change almost anyone and if

74
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:42,620
you don't have people that will tell you

75
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:45,860
to your face you're doing the wrong

76
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:47,769
things you will change and then she

77
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:50,299
finished off by completely

78
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:53,750
disassociating herself from James cross

79
00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:55,760
it feels like she she feels responsible

80
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:57,799
for creating this monster that is James

81
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,190
Charles and it makes sense to

82
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:02,540
disassociate with that I don't want to

83
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:05,150
be friends with you I don't want to be

84
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:07,280
associated with you and I need to say

85
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:09,829
that very publicly so that this chapter

86
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,110
can just be closed she explains some

87
00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:14,720
examples of how she helped James Charles

88
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:17,780
with contracts and her husband helping

89
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,510
him and all this sort of thing he didn't

90
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:22,789
have money for the flight or hotel so I

91
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,510
paid for that happily but your family

92
00:04:22,789 --> 00:04:26,120
how can I help you

93
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:28,430
my husband would spend hours on the

94
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,889
phone looking over contracts getting him

95
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:33,020
in a better position so we helped him

96
00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:35,539
get into a style Hall back when

97
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:38,030
basically no one wanted to work with him

98
00:04:35,539 --> 00:04:40,280
because of his Ebola scandal and then

99
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:42,470
finally with the I think the most

100
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,419
hard-hitting thing is about how James

101
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:49,760
Charles kind of used his fame and power

102
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:53,860
to get straight people into getting with

103
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:56,780
him that's sort of his kink it seems but

104
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:59,330
okay right and she calls out what's

105
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:01,789
problematic about that literally made me

106
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:03,770
want to vomit oh my god you tried to

107
00:05:01,789 --> 00:05:07,310
trick a straight man into thinking he's

108
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:09,530
gay yet again and somehow you're the

109
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:13,780
victim you know it's really disgusting

110
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:16,370
to manipulate someone's sexuality

111
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:19,010
especially when they are still you know

112
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:21,169
emerging into adulthood and don't quite

113
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:23,690
have everything figured out you are

114
00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:25,400
using your fame your power your money to

115
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,990
play with people's emotions you're

116
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,710
threatening to ruin them you're

117
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:32,419
threatening to embarrass them that's

118
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:34,640
basically the gist of the video James

119
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:36,440
Cook Charles not a good person I think

120
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,060
there's plenty of reason to dislike him

121
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,150
I mean

122
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:42,340
seen so many strange things about him as

123
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:43,930
soon as anyone says anything about James

124
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:45,460
Charles you'll get this tweet saying

125
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:47,350
this is not funny delete this

126
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:49,990
immediately or my lawyer will be in

127
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:52,000
contact okay old disclaimer I'm not

128
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:54,820
excusing his behavior I don't think it's

129
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,010
right but we there's a massive amount of

130
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:59,650
backlash he's facing the biggest sub

131
00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:01,540
drop that anyone's ever faced on YouTube

132
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:04,290
look at all the controversies that has

133
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:07,690
happened on YouTube is this really like

134
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:09,700
that comparable it seems to me like a

135
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:11,350
lot of people respect this taki figure

136
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:13,030
at least in the beauty community and

137
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:14,740
James Charles is already in this

138
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:16,870
controversial figure that people aren't

139
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:19,060
really sure about so for hit hard to

140
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:21,070
make this big sense of disassociating

141
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:23,020
herself from James Charles it seems that

142
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:25,900
a lot of people are just latching on to

143
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:27,700
that just to [ __ ] on James Charles which

144
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:30,790
I get it it's funny it's like everyone

145
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:32,110
is like because there are a couple

146
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:34,000
things about this that genuinely

147
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:36,340
bothered me when I saw it why did this

148
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,680
video actually being made why what cost

149
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:40,540
her to get so upset it's not really

150
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,760
clear in the video at least unless you

151
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:44,530
understand it what happen I looked into

152
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:47,770
it and the whole thing makes even less

153
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:49,990
sense at least you know for an outsider

154
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:52,150
I could still misunderstand things about

155
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:55,030
it but this is what caused the

156
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:57,100
controversy this Instagram post to a

157
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:58,600
sugar bear hair I met their team weekend

158
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,280
want a Coachella and they really helped

159
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,300
me my friends out with sister security

160
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,919
because it was crazy

161
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:05,650
you guys probably already know about

162
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:07,300
their iconic hair vitamins but they just

163
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:09,850
came out with brand new vegan sleep

164
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:11,590
vitamins and first of all it's Obama but

165
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:13,270
most importantly I've been dealing with

166
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:14,710
a lot of anxiety recently and it always

167
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:17,169
comes late at night when I'm laying in

168
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:18,820
bed thinking which is not fun or fresh

169
00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:19,840
um so I've been taking these attorneys

170
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,639
on this before bed and they've been

171
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,070
really really hoping you guys want to

172
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:26,289
check it out you can sweep up James

173
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:30,430
Charles is dealing with existential

174
00:07:26,289 --> 00:07:32,500
dread just take some sleep Vitamix okay

175
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:36,160
that's it that's what caused this whole

176
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:38,380
thing and that is what caused Tati to go

177
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,320
on Instagram and pose this big rant

178
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:42,930
about how obsessed she was when you do

179
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:47,190
so much for people in your life

180
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:54,210
and they not only don't return the favor

181
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:56,280
but they just don't even see you so why

182
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:58,920
was this a big deal for taffy well taffy

183
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:01,500
has her own brand of vitamins which our

184
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:05,570
health and beauty vitamins so for him to

185
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:08,070
not promote his friend her friends

186
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:09,870
vitamin product and still and promote

187
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:12,240
some other products

188
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:15,720
apparently she felt very betrayed by

189
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:18,420
this I'm just so upset the product that

190
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:22,920
James promoted was for sleeping pill

191
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:26,700
with brand new vegan asleep Patty's

192
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:29,490
product is for health and beauty yes the

193
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:32,550
company does do those type as well but

194
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:34,410
he specifically held up this bag of bold

195
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:37,080
bundle of sleep pills and that's what he

196
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:39,870
talked about their sleep so after Tati

197
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:42,300
made miss post on Instagram James

198
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:44,490
Charles deleted the post and apologized

199
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:46,260
said I want to publicly apologize to my

200
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:48,090
close friend Tati she's been like a

201
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,710
mother and blah blah blah support and

202
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:51,420
this weekend I didn't scream started for

203
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:53,940
vitamins cuz they helped me it would

204
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:55,890
secure it at Coachella I do not accept

205
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:58,200
any money party has a vitamin bribe

206
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:59,910
which I take daily I did not think about

207
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,190
the competition which was a major

208
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:04,440
oversight I've supported tightly both

209
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:06,540
online and up like she's done to me I'm

210
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,460
devastated that I heard someone that I

211
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:10,590
truly love and have endless respect for

212
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:13,800
so he deleted the poets didn't take any

213
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:15,420
money and a polytechnic maybe i'm naive

214
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,730
seems to me like this was an oversight

215
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:20,070
for my creators perspective i've done

216
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:21,720
this to a brand does you a favor and you

217
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:25,110
just be like alright fine and it's the

218
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:27,300
chain okay we're cool now it's kind of

219
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:29,490
like a throwaway thing it doesn't seem

220
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:31,200
impossible that this was just a mistake

221
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:32,460
you know it seems like the kind of thing

222
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,670
where they could just call each other

223
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:37,140
and resolve this but according to Tati i

224
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:38,850
want to share with you guys really

225
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:40,170
quickly why I'm being so public about

226
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:41,580
this because I know the first thing a

227
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:42,450
lot of people will say is hey why didn't

228
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,160
you pick up the phone

229
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:45,630
why didn't you message him back like you

230
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:49,050
guys should handle this privately

231
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:51,450
right why not I don't get it I really

232
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:53,310
don't get it let's hear the motivation

233
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:55,140
to why she decided to

234
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:57,090
this video to destroy game with Charles

235
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:59,460
courier I was planning on hopping in my

236
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:03,480
car and you know sitting down with him

237
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:07,140
but I changed my mind very very quickly

238
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:11,160
I was planning to talk to James but she

239
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:14,010
changed her mind why when I found out

240
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:16,080
that he had been giving his side to

241
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:18,510
Drama channels he had been in contact

242
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,860
with plenty of them I immediately knew

243
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:22,860
that this was all about damage control

244
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:25,740
and had little to do with his care for

245
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:27,690
me because I just don't so basically she

246
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:30,870
didn't resolve this privately with James

247
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:33,330
Charles because she found out that he's

248
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:35,310
been talking to drama channels something

249
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:38,400
that she admits that she's done as well

250
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:42,089
she said she talked to I have spoken to

251
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:43,860
drama channels that reached out and one

252
00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:47,550
of them is here for the tea the other is

253
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:48,839
tea spill she's spoken to draw my

254
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:50,160
channels as well and this is the reason

255
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:52,830
why she didn't want to talk to James

256
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:56,220
well if you go to one of the drama

257
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:59,550
channels that she mentions t-cells they

258
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:01,200
post that James Charles said this until

259
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:03,000
toffee feels comfortable and ready to

260
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,589
talk to me in private I don't feel

261
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,120
comfortable commenting her about her

262
00:11:04,589 --> 00:11:08,460
public immediately knew that this was

263
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,560
all about damage control and had little

264
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:12,630
to do with his care for me because I

265
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,400
just thought she was mad that he talked

266
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:17,070
to drama channels because she thought he

267
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:21,839
was gonna expose her this is what he

268
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:24,030
said I really don't get it I'm not here

269
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,490
to defend James Charles I just don't

270
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:29,160
think what's hot you did is that

271
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:30,870
justified she says how Fame changed

272
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:34,650
James Charles and that she's been his

273
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:37,890
mentor figure for her fame power and a

274
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:40,860
fat bank account will change almost

275
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:43,170
anyone she say she try to be that person

276
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:47,040
for him but I think it's worth noting

277
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:49,200
here that Tati is 37 years old James

278
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,990
Charles is still a teenager

279
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:56,070
yes he's 19 yes that is an excuse his

280
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:59,100
behavior but for a mother figure to just

281
00:11:56,070 --> 00:12:01,650
completely drag this kid there's no one

282
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:03,150
no one has a problem with this over

283
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:05,459
something that could be resolved in

284
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:07,080
private I had P I have plenty of

285
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:09,899
youtubers

286
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:13,440
being unfair to me publicly that has

287
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:15,269
been humiliating but either we talk it

288
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,800
out in private or I just stop being

289
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:17,459
friends with them it's not that

290
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,140
difficult

291
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:21,180
I can't imagine just making a video

292
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:23,490
publicly dragging someone instead of

293
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:25,200
talking to them ignoring their calls and

294
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:28,560
just be like I'm gonna drag this person

295
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,269
online instead it feels very manipulated

296
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,250
this whole thing maybe you don't agree

297
00:12:30,269 --> 00:12:34,680
with me on that but I have a few more

298
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:36,839
points to prove that and it's how she

299
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:39,390
talks about her brand if you ask people

300
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:42,180
what what did James Charles do people

301
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:44,820
will say oh he try to manipulate people

302
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:47,399
about their sexuality that was the big

303
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:50,040
drama right but then what has that to do

304
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:53,760
with Tatiana ex Brian's good enough on

305
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:56,459
its own and we're selling like hotcakes

306
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:59,430
like I don't need to at this point as we

307
00:12:56,459 --> 00:13:01,470
grow maybe I will but that's not where

308
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:04,829
my spend is like I don't I'm not gonna

309
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:06,390
put $100,000 into an Instagram post for

310
00:13:04,829 --> 00:13:09,690
someone to jam a pill in their mouth and

311
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:11,399
smiled it probably isn't taking it I'd

312
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:14,100
rather put that hundred thousand dollars

313
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:15,990
into research and creating a really dope

314
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,459
product that people really love and

315
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:19,950
that's why they come back for more

316
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:22,079
my product is selling like hotcakes I

317
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:23,970
just care about spending money to make

318
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:28,290
my product as good as possible

319
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:30,570
these are she's this is a mad go with my

320
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:32,760
intuition and to like really really try

321
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:34,560
to do the right thing and to be a good

322
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,510
person and I know I'm a role model and

323
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,520
that matters to me and that has gravity

324
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:40,770
to me people see me as a good person and

325
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:43,890
I know I'm a role model it feels a lot

326
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:46,980
like James Charles bad me very good very

327
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:48,720
good my brand good James Charles Baggett

328
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:50,760
and I want to make a difference and let

329
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,589
me also share that when I do reach the

330
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:55,170
level of success that I hope to with hey

331
00:13:52,589 --> 00:13:57,660
I'm gonna make a lot of positive changes

332
00:13:55,170 --> 00:14:01,079
they have huge plans for what I want to

333
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:02,160
do to give back and if you want to do

334
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:04,410
good with this brand

335
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,449
oh she has clients for huge changes to

336
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:08,190
do a lot of good then just do it saying

337
00:14:06,449 --> 00:14:11,850
you're gonna do good things means

338
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:13,579
nothing okay it's this another thing it

339
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,910
just feels weird to me how everyone

340
00:14:13,579 --> 00:14:17,010
absolutely

341
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:19,230
her look how many people like this video

342
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:22,350
it feels very manipulative she's putting

343
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:24,660
herself on a pedestal while she clearly

344
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:26,520
was completely find not outing this

345
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:28,920
behaviors about James Charles

346
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:30,720
essentially using people's sexuality and

347
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:33,720
as long as James Charles would have

348
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,040
instead promoted her vitamins she would

349
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,570
have been fine with it she would not

350
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,340
have made this video she would have been

351
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:38,910
good boy James Charles thank you very

352
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,890
much

353
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:42,990
all these issue the rights just because

354
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:45,000
it was an opportunity for her to do that

355
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:47,490
and I do have a big problem with that

356
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,380
and to be a good person and I know I'm a

357
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:50,610
role model and that matters to me

358
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,890
and the fact that a lot of people are

359
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:54,900
celebrating this ISM something positive

360
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:57,990
because yes it's fun to drag someone

361
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:59,430
online it's very troubling to me how

362
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:03,090
this sort of behavior gets rewarded

363
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:05,370
online this is 24 million views for me

364
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:07,110
to be the only one thinking this way it

365
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:08,700
feels bit weird to me that's why I feel

366
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:10,920
like I have to bring my opinion this

367
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:13,860
from a youtuber perspective James

368
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:16,170
Charles has not been secret about liking

369
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:17,970
straight guys it's something that he's

370
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:37,110
been spelling out for years

371
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:38,940
attractive straight boys will be some

372
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:42,060
people were fine with this until it

373
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:42,720
became a big deal until it's like oh

374
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,880
okay

375
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,550
now everyone instead of following James

376
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,620
Charles like all these people in the

377
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:51,990
community that are also so controversial

378
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:54,630
have all unfolded him I feel like there

379
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:56,400
has to be something else right actually

380
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:57,810
be something else that James Charles has

381
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,400
done that I don't know about that it

382
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:01,680
hasn't surfaced yet because otherwise

383
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:03,720
this is I just doesn't make sense to me

384
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,900
I'm not saying that I think is it isn't

385
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:09,800
I just say they both expose himself in

386
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:12,360
my opinion so again according to Tom P

387
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,950
this whole thing started because Todd do

388
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,860
you think that he went through this

389
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:19,170
elaborate stunt at Coachella about

390
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:20,350
security to make a promo for this

391
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:27,730
vitamin Brandon

392
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:31,630
gram and everyone's going T [ __ ]

393
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:35,870
cringe so pathetic all of you that was

394
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:38,950
my opinion I'm poppy po Pipo goodbye

395
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:38,950
