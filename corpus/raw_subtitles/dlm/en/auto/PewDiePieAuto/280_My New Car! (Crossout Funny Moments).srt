6
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:20,150
seen where some guy literally slam-dunk

7
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:26,420

we're not gonna do that today however

10
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,850
the gist of this game is that you can

11
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:33,560
build your own vehicles and then you

12
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:35,090
fight against other people and depending

13
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,100
on how much parts you put into the

14
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:39,170
vehicle you'll fight stronger or worse

15
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,430
people I'm kind of new to this game but

16
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:42,680
I'm really drawn into the creative

17
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:44,960
aspect of it so I'll build some quirky

18
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:47,090

I shouldn't be judging people for their

110
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,620
different sizes okay so this is the

111
00:07:19,849 --> 00:07:23,210
people mobile obviously the greatest

112
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:25,010

although this is not really my creation

120
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:42,740
I have an idea to make it even better

121
00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:47,570

00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:49,669

does some more damage to Melly right

131
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:26,340
which one knows it there it is so

132
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:28,919
another cool thing about this game is

133
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:31,560
that they have a bunch of not just PvP

134
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:35,310
