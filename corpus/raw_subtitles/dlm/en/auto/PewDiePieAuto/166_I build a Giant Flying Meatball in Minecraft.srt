00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,589
hello and welcome to minecraft although

2
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:09,389
today is gonna be a little different

3
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:11,340
spend spent he loves me so basically

4
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:13,679
you've seen all these crazy redstone

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:16,949
contraptions people built moving houses

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,820
but today we're gonna build a moving

7
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:21,869
meatball

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:23,640
it's that Reisman your fake friend

9
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:26,220
whatever I've never built a moving

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,189
meatball I'm not a redstone expert I'm

11
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:33,390
not even redstone amateur but I will try

12
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:35,550
I will try my best to bail okay let's

13
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,590
get up here so then you can't come how

14
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:40,739
tall should I build it this height no I

15
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:42,780
need to I need to be higher this will

16
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:46,350
take a long time by the way I already

17
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:48,180
know like the next couple today illegal

18
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,980
all right this has to be taller than any

19
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,719
mountain right okay

20
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,870
so with the new honey block basically

21
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,670
you can put slime and honey next to each

22
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,079
other without them sticking to each

23
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,750
other which means you can build giant

24
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,390
structures that pushes each other so the

25
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:05,939
plan is have something that some sort of

26
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:08,189
contraption with this pushes then this

27
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:11,540
pushes and then this pushes kind of like

28
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:14,090
domino effect of pushing that will cause

29
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:19,020
yeah I don't know what I'm doing okay

30
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:21,570
well this work okay oh my god this can

31
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:24,900
be so much harder with you spend please

32
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:29,759
I need I seriously need alright this is

33
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:33,020
a bad idea you just jump mad land you

34
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:36,360
can come with a meatball when I'm done

35
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:39,630
everyone ah c'est magnifique this should

36
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:42,150
work you push this those push each other

37
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:47,490
and these should be able to push a lot

38
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:49,290
as well there it is it's beautiful well

39
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:51,479
I got some big brain yeah I feel my

40
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:54,570
brain coming large we will do it like

41
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:57,060
this we put the cerebrum over here

42
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:59,070
that's a push and then we'll just have

43
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:02,999
something push this guy big brain

44
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:08,700
bing-bam-boom push that yeah

45
00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:08,700
watch pop and how do I make it stop

46
00:02:08,739 --> 00:02:13,870
I need to stop we're moving away from

47
00:02:11,379 --> 00:02:17,290
spending I don't like this oh god how do

48
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:19,420
I make it stop okay we made it stop okay

49
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:21,340
so question number two is when we put

50
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:24,040
them next to each other does that work

51
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:27,250
at all it's an in theory we can build it

52
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:29,170
as big as possible I would just get

53
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,760
activate them both at the same time I

54
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:32,379
don't know how to do that will that work

55
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,569
no this won't work what are you doing

56
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:38,500
over there oh you pushed it you snake

57
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:40,299
that's fine yeah that works actually I

58
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:45,090
was just gonna activate them at the same

59
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:45,090
time give me two second game errs Oh

60
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,709
what they were supposed to be activated

61
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:53,200
at the same time I didn't know oh of

62
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:55,030
course they're really okay we'll leave

63
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,420
it's sort of works it's kind of cool

64
00:02:55,030 --> 00:03:02,470
actually

65
00:02:55,420 --> 00:03:04,540
oh Jesus Christ it stopped this thing

66
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:06,220
can't really turn around I feel spend

67
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:08,230
I'll be back don't worry don't worry

68
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:11,260
gamer all right we know that it works

69
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:14,109
vertically now horizont stop we know it

70
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:16,450
works horizontally now vertically

71
00:03:14,109 --> 00:03:19,120
whatever I always mix them up but does

72
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:21,250
it work upwardly that should be the real

73
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,889
word for it awkwardly does it work

74
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:26,530
upwardly let's find out just so we're

75
00:03:23,889 --> 00:03:29,260
clear I'm sure there's a way smarter way

76
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:32,200
to do this I am aware this is however

77
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:35,590
how I would get with my limited

78
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:40,590
knowledge okay all right upward testes

79
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:40,590
masti here we go

80
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:45,750
why you know there's an obsidian here

81
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:54,310
yeah okay no no stop that I did not ask

82
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,870
for this I did not ask I did not ask for

83
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:58,470
this damn it

84
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,470
go back

85
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:13,280

86
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:15,769

forgot the Obsidian okay

88
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:22,430
never again huh all right time to stop

89
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:32,000
being such a small brain we have to put

90
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:36,229
you there and you there okay now we put

91
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,880
a repeater one tick is Mickey one

92
00:04:36,229 --> 00:04:39,740
tickets Mickey or should the top one we

93
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:42,290
tickets Mickey top one should be tickets

94
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,530
Mickey here we go all right I should do

95
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:48,410
it

96
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:51,590
three two one what deaf all right Morty

97
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:56,419
Keese Mickey then Jesus alright here we

98
00:04:51,590 --> 00:05:00,020
go three two one that makes no sense now

99
00:04:56,419 --> 00:05:03,950
I'm actually mad listen up did not did I

100
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:06,560
put the observer on the wrong way oh why

101
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:10,160
did I delete it all I deleted everything

102
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,780
oh my brain so small got a six pack

103
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,479
I'm such an idiot did I put the repeater

104
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:16,669
next to it has to be a further away will

105
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:20,680
do two ticks just to be saying hey to

106
00:05:16,669 --> 00:05:20,680
one this will work

107
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:38,150
yeah oh yeah okay yeah

108
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:39,920
take those owls one boy I I wish I saved

109
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:41,900
before I did that started to rebuild it

110
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,460
but now in at least we know we know how

111
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,410
to build it now we just need to make it

112
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:47,000
go back to Savannah and make it five

113
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:53,660
times bigger is that gonna lag my

114
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:56,410
computer it's fine so now we have the

115
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:59,570
design we just we can just make it a

116
00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:01,520
same way just ten times bigger I hope

117
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:05,840
this works I don't know I forgot what

118
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:08,360
was the design I think it was like this

119
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,430
I think I'll make it twelve by twelve oh

120
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,200
my god this is gonna be a beast

121
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:14,150
so something creative mode I feel like I

122
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,520
got to step it up oh my god it's gonna

123
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:20,390
take forever how do how to redstone

124
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:23,900
youtubers do it okay so quick test works

125
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:26,360
fine great why did I decide to do this I

126
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:28,669
hope it will work it will be I'm gonna

127
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:31,130
be so mad I've never done it so yeah

128
00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:32,360
this is all thanks to the new honey

129
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:33,470
block in Minecraft

130
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,419
alright if I talked about that that's

131
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:42,020
the reason why I can't do this on my own

132
00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:44,630
level this is the easy bit - god the

133
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:47,270
wiring I'll have to put in oh god the

134
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:49,370
wiring oh I realize I made a mistake you

135
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:53,240
imagine if I discover that after I built

136
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:55,250
everything I've got it's so hypnotizing

137
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:58,510
now we just gotta build all the motors

138
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,510
for it Jesus born

139
00:07:04,409 --> 00:07:13,330
all right gamers we have the motor ready

140
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:19,419
Oh God I'm doing a backup now because

141
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:21,430
I'm not losing this so in theory this

142
00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:23,680
should work in theory we need to build

143
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:25,860
like a launch pad once this baby starts

144
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:35,319
moving it's never gonna stop

145
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:37,720
no cool let's go back to my biggest fear

146
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:39,490
is not that it's not gonna work my

147
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,900
biggest fear is that is gonna not work

148
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,440
in a way that I don't understand why it

149
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:44,259
doesn't work

150
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,900
which seems the most likely here let's

151
00:07:44,259 --> 00:07:50,789
get real I am so nervous all right let

152
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,789
me do backup all right you ready gamers

153
00:07:53,040 --> 00:08:10,920
oh god it's terrifying

154
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:21,470
oh they won break no he didn't it's just

155
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:25,470
so laggy Jesus is ridiculous my computer

156
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:27,270
cannot handle they it's so scary I love

157
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:29,640
it did I do a backup I did a backup

158
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:31,770
right did I do a backup ok it's not the

159
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:33,120
most smooth looking thing in the world I

160
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:35,580
haven't really explained the whole

161
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,950
theory now we can build a meatball on

162
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:40,500
top of this and it that will push it

163
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:42,870
forward which will then some hens make

164
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,670
it a flying meatball so now I can

165
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:46,380
actually use course dirt well I feel

166
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:47,910
like this should be the easiest bit but

167
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:51,450
watch me [ __ ] it up

168
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:54,750
ok time to build a meatball oh what a

169
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:56,000
relief the biggest flying meatball the

170
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:58,680
world has ever seen

171
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,010
maybe we'll probably look social and I

172
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:06,180
think about it cuz my design is so

173
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:07,770
flawed but I don't care it means like I

174
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:10,890
could technically even make it bigger

175
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:13,710
but I think for now maybe later if I

176
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:17,520
have time today I'll do it bigger that

177
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:20,820
does not look like a meatball dude the

178
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:23,310
meat patch shout-out to mumbo jumbo as

179
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:25,440
well he does these moving house

180
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:27,660
tutorials and stuff like that that's

181
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,090
really cool I watched enough to like get

182
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:32,160
an idea how to do it ok this is the size

183
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:33,660
of our meatball but we want it to be 3d

184
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,970
obviously so I'm gonna do that

185
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:40,820
alright gamers you're ready let's beauty

186
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:40,820
is oh it's moving forward

187
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:49,690
[Laughter]

188
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:51,940
ladies and gentlemen I present to you

189
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:53,800
the biggest flying meatball the world

190
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:57,370
has ever seen I am not sure what I'm

191
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:59,650
looking at but it is working it is as if

192
00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:03,660
minecraft is saying no this shouldn't be

193
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:03,660
possible but yes it is

194
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:10,190
[Music]

195
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:17,410
Brod should can I stand on it that's the

196
00:10:16,569 --> 00:10:22,959
real question

197
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:25,480
oh the evil laugh I understand my bill

198
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:31,329
is having this is so satisfying

199
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:34,089
peasants peasants dirty fools scoundrels

200
00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:35,980
could probably make it so it bums stuff

201
00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:38,680
as well on everything that he goes on

202
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:42,910
but that just might be too evil so the

203
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:44,860
deepest meatball where you can make what

204
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:48,699
a great sense the deepers meatball you

205
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:51,279
can make is 12 right now it's 8 the one

206
00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:54,490
we made is 8 so we are going to make

207
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:57,699
this bigger about this much and then I

208
00:10:54,490 --> 00:11:00,790
also want to try and see if we can have

209
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:03,009
bombs shooting down from the meatball to

210
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:05,019
make it the ultimate death weapon I know

211
00:11:03,009 --> 00:11:07,329
this is a dangerous video for me to make

212
00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:10,990
because evil leaders around the world

213
00:11:07,329 --> 00:11:12,970
might watch and they inspire but you got

214
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:16,180
to do what you got to do ok so how would

215
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:18,550
we make something that bombs I don't

216
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:20,620
know because the top layer will move

217
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:22,389
with one tick Lance I might be able to

218
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:24,819
use that I mean another way it would

219
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:27,189
just be to plant the P and T and T and

220
00:11:24,819 --> 00:11:30,160
advance I might just do that because

221
00:11:27,189 --> 00:11:31,899
that's so much easier ok well if this

222
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:36,000
wasn't gonna like my computer before it

223
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:36,000
sure as heck in well now

224
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:48,880
yes destroy I just hear explosions I

225
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:50,699
can't actually see them the weather is

226
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:57,040

227
00:11:50,699 --> 00:11:59,820
