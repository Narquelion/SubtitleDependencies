00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:29,730
name is Marc and he will go to extreme

8
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:32,309
measures to save money or to make money

9
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:34,140
I find this very fascinated I never

10
00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:42,600
heard of extreme cheap stakes before

11
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:44,399
likes freaking watch people misplace

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,190
millions of dollars in loose change

13
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:51,030
every year and their loss is this

14
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:52,980
cheapskates gain Wow so he just goes

15
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,110
around like a Marc spends his free time

16
00:00:52,980 --> 00:01:02,100
hunting down dimes nickels and pennies

17
00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:02,840
all over Las Vegas can you just get a

18
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,119
job

19
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:11,729
does he have a job no I'm self-employed

20
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:13,710
so what do you do shut shut up legend

21
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:15,990
I like our cuts from this shot him being

22
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:22,950
excited about a penny to him wearing a

23
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:24,869
suit and I run this casino I'm the owner

24
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:30,960
of this casino I just like extra change

25
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:32,340
sue me interesting all right well

26
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,960
clearly it's not a cheap steak if it has

27
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,240
a dog okay

28
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,770
that is completely contradictory I will

29
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,960
point out all the fallacies in there

30
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:42,780
really good person but obviously he's

31
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,430
the extreme cheapskate nine it's got to

32
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,930
be so tough to be friends with a real

33
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,329
cheapskate I never heard that expression

34
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,829
before it's like I don't I wouldn't mind

35
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:52,079
paying for friends but at the same time

36
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:53,640
it's like if they assume and it becomes

37
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,369
a standard it's just kind of like all

38
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,649
right hmm I make it sound like I do I

39
00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:00,659
don't but you know what I mean the penny

40
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:02,340
loafers from back in the day but the

41
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:04,259
interesting thing about this and this is

42
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:10,200
how you can really tell okay what's

43
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:11,460
interesting about the shoes when my

44
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,550
roommates dog

45
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:16,320

repair store people drop off the shoes

57
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,940
they forget about them or don't have the

58
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:50,100
money to pick them up okay I mean fine

59
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,930
so far I can't really blame that you

60
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,290
should take care of your shoes I agree

61
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,880
with that

65
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,480

66
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:03,480
my shoes hold up

67
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,640

70
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:13,080

just get shoe backs or whatever whatever

72
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,170

74
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:23,310
Oh mark has a habit of doing things that

75
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:25,560
are a little bit beyond what I consider

76
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:27,750
cheapskate mark okay what is rihanna gin

00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,140

81
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:38,820

00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:40,290

your money knowing how to make extra

125
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:47,800
money knowing how to get the best value

126
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:50,380
I guess I guess like no you know what I

127
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,120
probably would yeah I would I'm just

128
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:54,610
thinking like if you're I guess I would

129
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,960
assume if someone asked me to throw in

130
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:57,970
laundry with them they have to be really

131
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,610
poor so I kind of want to help them so I

132
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:01,960
am a good person of course and it's of

133
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:05,740
course easy for me to say this in

134
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:07,570
retrospect but he does not do it he

135
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:09,700
discerned it to save money for your

136
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:11,760
money that's the difference well he

137
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:14,430
won't spend a single cent on laundry

138
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:16,230
mark does like to gamble but even at the

139
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:18,450
casinos he's found a way to make sure

140
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:20,910
he's never parting with his own money

141
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:24,000
wait what the hell so he's he's saving

142
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:26,280
money just we can gamble to feed his

143
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,350
gambling addiction why would he do that

144
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,640
he'd buy a good buy G fuel we can but do

145
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:32,070
anything what a waste

146
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:36,660
he saves money just to waste it what the

147
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:39,660
hell there was no money there mark and

148
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:41,820
you goddamn knowing that I find I don't

149
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:43,950
spend more than $5 and I only play the

150
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:52,080
penny slots because you could win up to

151
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:54,300
$10,000 have you won $10,000 mark I'd

152
00:06:52,080 --> 00:07:02,730
only lose a maximum of five dollars not

153
00:06:54,300 --> 00:07:05,370
a whole page what the hell

154
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:07,890
what you say money but you order drinks

155
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:10,530
out what the hell mark you're not a team

156
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:12,450
stake I keep calling it stink like a

157
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:14,100
cheap steak that doesn't cut it all

158
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:16,590
right if I went to a bar the strip would

159
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,310
cost me 12 to 15 dollars but by coming

160
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:20,130
to a casino

161
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:24,710
I played the penny slots win money and

162
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:27,510
drink for free money is free and casinos

163
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:28,550
money is free and casinos yes that's

164
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:35,190
what I said

165
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:36,180
fraid so large alcohol alcohol I'm sorry

166
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:39,000
I don't know what's wrong with me I

167
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:41,930
didn't sleep much on 67 cents this is

168
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,930
what one dollar can do

169
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:45,379
but I'm gambling I know when to stop

170
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:46,699
most people think oh yeah I'm gonna keep

171
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:48,919
going they double and double and triple

172
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:49,580
I'm like no you got to know when to walk

173
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:51,590
away

174
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:53,689
Martin all right it was fair enough I

175
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:57,319
respect that he goes around and always

176
00:07:53,689 --> 00:07:59,990
looking for things to do to try to save

177
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:01,729
money first time that I realized he was

178
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:03,650
cheap was definitely when he was trying

179
00:08:01,729 --> 00:08:05,750
to get me to do every single medical

180
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:08,330
study that I could qualify for in the

181
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:10,159
past why mark has volunteered in more

182
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:12,379
than a hundred medical studies and the

183
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:14,389
riskier the trial the better it pays

184
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:16,069
what I was doing clinical trials I would

185
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:19,969
get these scrubs I would take a pill he

186
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:21,469
takes a cold for daily work I mean yeah

187
00:08:19,969 --> 00:08:23,900
why not in for doing other clinical

188
00:08:21,469 --> 00:08:25,819
trials why not long wait the clothing is

189
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,979
a huge problem for the environment mark

190
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:30,560
is saving the world guys we should be

191
00:08:27,979 --> 00:08:32,659
thanking him cheap to clean and they

192
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,279
were free these are the scrubs from the

193
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:36,649
clinical trials these all represent a

194
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:38,779
part of history for example a part of me

195
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:43,459
it seems of the Eboli study this is my

196
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:45,709
what what what this man is fearless

197
00:08:43,459 --> 00:08:48,320
everyone was panicked with my friend and

198
00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:51,350
I did this study never tested on humans

199
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,690
or animals before we were the first in

200
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:55,850
the country to have it done it's $5,000

201
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:57,380
for a week so why would I not do it I

202
00:08:55,850 --> 00:09:01,130
couldn't do it I can think of a couple

203
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:03,410
reasons if you could choose a bullet

204
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:07,010
wasn't that a super high death rate what

205
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:09,050
the hell Jesus Christ dude I get saving

206
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:11,449
money but sacrificing your help I mean

207
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:17,089
then again someone has to do it so I

208
00:09:11,449 --> 00:09:19,220
guess it's commendable trying to be from

209
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:21,079
the crazier trials but Mark's full well

210
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:22,940
into it the two studies that I'm waiting

211
00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:24,949
on that I have not been in yet is a

212
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:27,350
flatline study this is a really good one

213
00:09:24,949 --> 00:09:29,180
what they do is flatten my heart for one

214
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:32,839
minute but you still breathe stay there

215
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:34,699
14 days pays $25,000 14 days you kind of

216
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:37,699
stepped in and stopped that the second

217
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:40,100
one that I goddamn FDA stop the heart

218
00:09:37,699 --> 00:09:43,959
stopping surgery maybe it's a really

219
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:43,959
important one what

220
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:52,040
he's so like yeah check this out they're

221
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:53,899
gonna stop my heart for 14 days I might

222
00:09:52,040 --> 00:10:00,080
not come out of line and those goddamn

223
00:09:53,899 --> 00:10:02,029
if ta stop it oh jeez he says it's so

224
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,250
casually I think that's it I'm really

225
00:10:02,029 --> 00:10:06,920
anxious and really excited and waiting

226
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:08,810
to do is this testicular study what you

227
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,279
do is you go in and you donate one of

228
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:12,140
your chester goals they replace it with

229
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:14,110
an artificial one and when you check out

230
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:20,060
after 14 days you get a check for

231
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:24,350
$35,000 damn 35 K for adjusted Gail's

232
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:29,060
did he get would you do it 35 K what

233
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:33,649
would that be for me yeah yeah I don't

234
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:35,600
need to oh my god this mint is hardcore

235
00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:38,149
I'll give him that he's hardcore

236
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,310
I may have underestimated him gets free

237
00:10:38,149 --> 00:10:42,589
checkups every month to see if he's a

238
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:44,709
good candidate for each study free

239
00:10:42,589 --> 00:10:47,779
checkup that's pretty good actually for

240
00:10:44,709 --> 00:10:49,220
a physical examination it's gonna take

241
00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:51,940
some blood make sure that I don't have

242
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,940
high cholesterol diabetes

243
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:05,190
so what's motivating you to want to go

244
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:05,640
under the knife and be part of the study

245
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:12,540
like that

246
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:14,610
the money has made a second the money so

247
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:16,440

to save lives I've read the study about

252
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:28,920
this about destroys clinical trial and I

253
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,170
think it can help a lot of people's

254
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:33,000
lives out there so I know this it's just

255
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:34,950
a big sacrifice for me but I know I'm

256
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,290
doing the money I'm doing it for the

257
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:38,830
money

258
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:38,830

probably don't have to H as much oh okay

263
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:08,370
have you ever had doctor says I I guess

264
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:10,680
say the doctor has to check if they're

265
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:13,110
crazy right is that that has to be a

266
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,430
thing right any a made lunatic I'm just

267
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:15,900

converted into estrogen somebody go get

281
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,920
there's testicle yanked out as part of

282
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:51,750

kidding

302
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:38,540
a low test result for mark would take

303
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:41,240
him out of the running for the

304
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:45,440
testicular study okay Jim Utley there's

306
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,850
risk to you it's pretty significant I'm

307
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:52,310
