00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,009
good morning gamers we're continuing a

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:07,099
man of mad Dan that's right because I am

3
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:13,889
on my honeymoon while you're watching

4
00:00:07,099 --> 00:00:18,750
very a mishap with the barbecue the

5
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:19,920
whole boat was lit up yeah what what

6
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,390
what's up with the other boat let's ask

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,100
what's up with that other boat these

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:26,250
fishing guys came by and ran into the

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:28,560
dive line whatever who cares right

10
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:31,579
what I would weigh is what you guys find

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:35,250
well we found the plate and it is huge

12
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:36,750
full of cool stuff unfortunately we did

13
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:42,239
not leave it as pristine as we could

14
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:43,520
have what why the dive line actually how

15
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,260
bad

16
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,100
there's no cockpit anymore for starters

17
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:52,620
well that's just [ __ ] perfect

18
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:57,890
don't swore she swore it don't like

19
00:00:52,620 --> 00:01:01,530
Stewart oh and it's review time baby

00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:06,900
tell me how I did tell me how I killed

21
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:08,939
it let's hear a gamer you're getting to

22
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,909
know these intrepid adventurers then

23
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:15,540
Alex and his little brother Brad trying

24
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:19,259
to swim with the big fish both seem out

25
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:22,890
of their depth indeed indeed and Julia

26
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:24,670
the love of Alex's life and he the love

27
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:27,580
of hers

28
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:31,450
what about Conrad a bold fellow you

29
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:33,880
might say well maybe you'd say arrogant

30
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:40,810
I don't know and there's captain Flitz

31
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:43,060
plays strong forthright stubborn do I

32
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:46,990
detect a spark between her and Conrad

33
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:49,330
who knows anything can happen at me

34
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:52,800
reassure you you've helped them to make

35
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:57,340
some decisions they'll value later on

36
00:01:52,800 --> 00:02:00,460
you're doing well yes he likes me

37
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:02,500
EPIK I thought he would scold me I'm

38
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:04,500
doing well gamers he heard heard it here

39
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,550
first

40
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,530
any time I do these kind of games

41
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:10,899
there's always the backseat gamers I

42
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:13,870
just can't handle it why did he know

43
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:16,630
looking surprising pretty much what

44
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:18,700
you'd expect Bradshaw was insane it was

45
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:20,290
like traveling through time no [ __ ]

46
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,730
well it was like traveling through time

47
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:23,410
and accidentally ending up in a

48
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:26,170
dimension where the past is underwater

49
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:28,480
and like everything particles and sharks

50
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:30,910
sharks excuse me Julia

51
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,950
I'm gonna need you to stop smiling I

52
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:36,640
can't keep playing if this goes on I'm

53
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:38,709
sorry to pause but my brief hey I

54
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,910
thought it was pretty intense wasn't

55
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:43,269
comrade gonna get us some more beers

56
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:45,250
after he helped Flis maybe he decided

57
00:02:43,269 --> 00:02:47,260
hey I'll drink some and then he got

58
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,890
drunk and since he was drunk he forgot

59
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,750
to bring it to us

60
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:51,310
and he just kept on drinking and he

61
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,450
drank all of it sounds like you've had

62
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:54,310
some experience with this kind of

63
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:57,010

119
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:08,280
I remember playing these type of games

120
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,200
when I was kid obviously very different

121
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:12,690
because these this genre didn't exist

122
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,520
but like I didn't mean to click on this

123
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:16,290

us if you wait that's interesting I

127
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:25,560
wonder if that changes things just just

128
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:29,010
looking how much games has improved over

129
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:30,240
yonder graphics is pretty it's cool to

130
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:34,370
be playing the games that really push

131
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,370
the forefront on that come here fix it

132
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:39,910
easy tiger we should get back I remember

133
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:42,160
playing this game called Egypt there's

134
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:43,420
something like that and I remember

135
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:51,010
looking at the grasses I'm like dude

136
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:56,620
that looks so epic I'm kind of curious

137
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:58,900
how that looks like now you'll get no

138
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:03,910
resistance there all right everyone

139
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:07,000
check it out Manchurian Gold who wants

140
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:09,670
to find some sunken treasure so what do

141
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,590
you think Adam coordinates those are

142
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:13,480
coordinates all right maybe the planes

143
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:15,820
destination you think we could get there

144
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,650
by tomorrow it takes a couple hours if

145
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:19,660
the weather stays steady but you know

146
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:21,400
it's gonna come there there was a flight

147
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:23,290
plan on board that seemed to indicate it

148
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:25,210
was a rescue plane yeah that makes sense

149
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:26,680
after the war they turned long-range

150
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:28,270
bombers into rescue planes and then this

151
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,530
plane must have been shot down cuz it

152
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:31,570
was riddled with bullet holes

153
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:33,400
I found one lodged in the fuselage huh

154
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:34,750
and it was full of life rafts and stuff

155
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,460
gotten shot down before they could

156
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:38,410
deliver all the rafts there was only one

157
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:40,180
missing reckless all of you

158
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:42,280
why use me I told you to leave

159
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:43,900
everything down there alone oh come on

160
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:46,960
we've been through this already I'm not

161
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:49,810
lying I love no Hey oh we're respectful

162
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:52,840
no you did whatever you wanted whatever

163
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:55,660
you took it was too much we took a

164
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:58,300
bullet okay listen you need a chill in

165
00:07:55,660 --> 00:08:00,130
that brick out oh come on no one knows

166
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:03,100
we've even been down there and I don't

167
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:05,800
think ghosts can talk you Americans are

168
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:08,290
all the same huh no respect for anyone

169
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,820
else's traditions I should have never

170
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:12,250
gone down to that claim in the first

171
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:13,570
place it's bad luck what is this one a

172
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:15,430
[ __ ] down there and it makes no

173
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:17,500
difference but every single thing you

174
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:19,210
bring back has an essence it's like a

175
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,630
ghost you invite to the surface there we

176
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:20,520
go

177
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:22,110
hi

178
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,520
I never thought about it like that you

179
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:25,169
never think about much of anything well

180
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,789
maybe I never heard about such cool

181
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:30,599
ghost stories they're not cool ghost

182
00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:32,250
stories not like for fun people drown in

183
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:34,099
these waters and you have to respect our

184
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:38,570

a lighthouse mister the top and a toll

204
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:27,000
isolated from the rest of the world of

205
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:29,550
lone beacon in the night a sailor's

206
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,910
respite the lighthouse keeper would hear

207
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:34,740
the waves pounding the rocky shore one

208
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:37,320
misty morning he comes upon a woman

209
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:39,480
covered in blood she's stumbling down

210
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,790
the beach he hurries to her aid and she

211
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,380
falls into his arms sobbing as he

212
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:45,360
hurries her back to the lighthouse he

213
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:48,510
asks where she's from he doesn't waste

214
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:53,700
any time it's smooth I respect it I

215

answers I live here in the lighthouse

217
00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:01,110
my parents are upstairs right now twists

218
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,570
of course the lighthouse keeper says

219
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:05,640
that isn't so of course he's lived there

220
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:07,649
alone for years and the woman becomes

221
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:10,260
hysterical and it's just her parents are

222
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:12,450
upstairs so they go to the top of the

223
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:15,000
lighthouse and they're splayed out on

224
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:17,279
the floor is a man and a woman brutally

225
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,589
murdered with an axe always an axe I

226
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:22,980
mean do people even use exes anymore yes

227
00:10:19,589 --> 00:10:25,380
yes they dance cliches and all chopped

228
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:27,830
up into little tiny giblets have an axe

229
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:30,690
just like we're Skolnick Oh

230
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:32,310
that's amping you know sometimes you

231
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:34,700
have to embellish the facts a little to

232
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:38,270
get at the deeper truth it's okay

233
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:41,940
okay so who did it

234
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:44,850
the woman says he was my husband and she

235
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:48,180
turns to the closet it says he's in

236
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:50,190
there is the husband and that's why I've

237
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:52,200
always been a little weary of marriage

238
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:56,190
so the lighthouse keeper or shadow a

239
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:59,640
closet opens the door and sure enough

240
00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:01,550
there's a man inside but he's cut his

241
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:04,440
own throat

242
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:09,360
horrified he was closer to see the dead

243
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:13,710
man's face in the dark closer closer and

244
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:17,250
he sees it's his own face and then its

245
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:23,940

555
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:54,410
internal memory Arion

556
00:35:54,809 --> 00:36:00,869
people you're covering Patterson card is

557
00:35:59,339 --> 00:36:04,079
tomorrow is sick again conveniently it's

558
00:36:00,869 --> 00:36:10,409
always when it has guard duties in hole

559
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:15,679
three a first into 3a let's remember

560
00:36:10,409 --> 00:36:18,679
that luckily he didn't see that

561
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:18,679
excellent

562
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:40,250
awesome you're going to see okay what's

563
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:43,420
happening in there jewel is gonna die

564
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:43,420
Julia pin the dad

565
00:36:49,100 --> 00:37:01,640
hey it's pitch black in here now we see

566
00:36:52,520 --> 00:37:04,930
a light just channeled a maybe French

567
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:08,560
people not so bad after all

568
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:08,560
yeah that was so worth

569
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:14,560
no problem gamers

570
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:33,860
the hell is this [ __ ] place dude even

571
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:36,800
those meatheads seem spooked yeah you

572
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:38,710
think this ship is the material gold we

573
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:41,390
are in the vicinity of those coordinates

574
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:43,010
Thanks boats never move over either so

575
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:46,880
that makes sense we can't just sit

576
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:50,710
around need a plan we're not exactly in

577
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:53,210
the best position to be making any moves

578
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:54,770
second they let their guard down we got

579
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:56,630
to take advantage of it and get off the

580
00:37:54,770 --> 00:38:00,560
ship yeah and get the bone and bling

581
00:37:56,630 --> 00:38:02,090
blang blang yeah man this whole rust

582
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:04,670
buckets one tetanus shot from the bottom

583
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:06,980
of the oh yes we tried to escape didn't

584
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:09,260
exactly work out we gotta get back to

585
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:11,930
the boat and find Brad what happened to

586
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:13,940
him no idea they swiped our distributor

587
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:16,390
cap gonna be difficult to get anywhere

588
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:16,390
without it

589
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:20,010
so can't we just like Hotwire or

590
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:22,470
something

591
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:24,810
oh so we can't even wire distributor cap

592
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:27,600
as [ __ ] knew exactly what they were

593
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:29,550
doing while those guys are out panning

594
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,540
from entering gold or whatever they

595
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:33,000
think they're gonna find on this

596
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:36,320
floating coffin we got to take advantage

597
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,320
and look around for a way out of here

598
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:42,119
easy easy

599
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:47,400
alright maybe we can find a painting

600
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:48,690
that we have what happened here maybe

601
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,730
with the man carrying gold they're

602
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:55,940
referring to that it's something else

603
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:55,940
right see I'm smart I'm big

604
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:03,140

00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:45,600
he clearly heard all our plans by the

622
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:47,490
way the French are spook the friend

623
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,480

00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:56,820
watching this just enjoy the perks of

628
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:58,890
our all-inclusive cruise nice I found a

629
00:40:56,820 --> 00:41:00,150
letter by the way some guy was writing

630
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:08,520
it was a little lady back home about all

631
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:10,680
the ghost crap on the ship ghosts yeah I

632
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:14,580
mean there aren't really ghosts here

633
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:16,980
yeah they race right yeah there is let's

634
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:19,280
hope we don't run across any ghosts got

635
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:22,650
our hands full already

636
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:24,510
okay we got one guy complaining about

637
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:25,590
another guy pretending to be sick so he

638
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:28,800
could get out of guarding one of the

639
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:30,610
holes yeah I guess he was kind of a

640
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,290
repeat offender

641
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:34,720
it sounds like nobody liked it very much

642
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:36,400
down there so I guess the moral of the

643
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:40,990
story is stay the [ __ ] away from the

644
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:43,150
Haunted Cardinals haunted maybe they

645
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:45,760
just didn't like working there yeah or

646
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:49,590
maybe there are super ghosts probably

647
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:53,260
super ghosts that's what super ghosts

648
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:55,780
ghosts but like 16min it's not a

649
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:56,880
reference yeah I don't know what you're

650
00:41:55,780 --> 00:42:04,120
saying

651
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:06,310
super ghosts super goes riding in this

652
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:12,730
is ten out of ten I just wish I knew

653
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:14,620
what the fishermen on Planet look those

654
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:16,090
meatballs are probably just paying for

655
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:18,880
some donors or meanwhile I said

656
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:21,430
derogatory she may not even exist I mean

657
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:30,160
what if they don't find anything then

658
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:32,110
we're [ __ ] so what do we do way I see

659
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:34,600
it we got two options we sneak out where

660
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:37,090
we stay here and fight simple as that

661
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:39,790
yeah sneaking out is a better option I

662
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:43,150
agree but I just don't know how we're

663
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:44,680
gonna do it okay well we're not gonna do

664
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:46,770
anything from in here we need to keep

665
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:50,880
looking around and try to find a way up

666
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:50,880
