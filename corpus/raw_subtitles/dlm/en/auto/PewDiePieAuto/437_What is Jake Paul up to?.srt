00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:13,330
to say that's really why I paid for no

185
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:18,490
one's liking their Fleshman stuff don't

186
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:20,470
worry I got you Dan I got you can I

187
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:22,750
dislike the other ones I'm only here for

188
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:25,450
Dane do you think these kids are signing

189
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:27,550
up to get a nine hour course of Billie

190
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:30,070
Jean I don't want to belittle maybe he

191
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:32,620
probably knows more than I do but I just

192
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:34,330
don't see the value for Jake Paul's

193
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,650
audience so I'm not gonna show that

194
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:38,110
footage because I'm pretty sure it'll

195
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:40,600
get copyrighted but it's basically the

196
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:42,640
person in your viewing Jake someone

197
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,920
that's more qualified has more

198
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,930
experience and actually seems to know

199
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:48,580
someone at least they're just interview

200
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:49,990
and Jake and talking about Jake stuff so

201
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,880
if you want to pay 20 bucks a month for

202
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:54,250
that I mean I'm not gonna stop you

203
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:56,980
my favorite part of this signing up to

204
00:07:54,250 --> 00:08:00,040
this course is not just for Dan

205
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:02,950
Fleischman it's for the community that's

206
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:06,160
right you get access to the private Jake

207
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:08,080
Paul financial freedom community so here

208
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,000
are the hurry I don't have any friends

209
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,950
I like this bend over what's up Jake

210
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,040
Pollard's if you're tired of all the

211
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:18,130
hate for Jake Paul like this post smash

212
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:20,590
like I'll be the first one it's really

213
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:23,950
people just posting memes or asking if

214
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:25,870
how can I unsubscribe how can I stop

215
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:28,300
paying this I don't want to pay for this

216
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:29,380
and this guy replying you guys are so

217
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,490
stupid why do you want to join a

218
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:32,860
movement and then cancel your

219
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:34,390
subscription we check in do by the way

220
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,320
well maybe you don't want to pay 40

221
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:37,690
bucks a month

222
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,820
they start charging you 20 what started

223
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:42,190
to say that they're gonna charge you 40

224
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:46,120
after your sign up right if it was is it

225
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:47,950
always 50% of my photos I'll create an

226
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,540
album when they launch this thing they

227
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:51,370
had this whole event it's gonna be

228
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:54,070
massive right everyone's gonna want to

229
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:55,510
come to this financial freedom thing I

230
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:56,920
mean it looks from the looks of

231
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:58,660
engagement and all that it looks like

232
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,340
luckily not many people are buying into

233
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:03,070
this and then you can look at the launch

234
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:04,750
which is great so here it is it's gonna

235
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:08,490
be all over it it's gonna be a whole

236
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:16,360
line it's gonna be tan akan 3.0 and

237
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:19,120
here's the reality a bunch of kids about

238
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,970
what a dozen maybe I don't know how much

239
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,260
that is and I think this is for the

240
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:28,600
people that bought the merch or

241
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:32,370
something like that there's more cops

242
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,370
there than actual people visiting

243
00:09:35,629 --> 00:09:41,610
what does it say ideas ideas are without

244
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:42,300
execution I thought it was gonna say

245
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:45,200
education

246
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:48,790
[Laughter]

247
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:51,160
[Applause]

248
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:55,120
that looked like I had a lot of fun who

249
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:59,830
wouldn't want to pay to go there it's

250
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:08,950
the same I don't know what's going on

251
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:12,840
great what a great event well I thought

252
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:12,840
this was a fight financial freedom Jake

253
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:43,540
it's very passionate Jake Paul is

254
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:50,740
complaining about how in school he

255
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:53,940
didn't know why he was there we have

256
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:53,940
some amazing experts

257
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:06,850
and actually learn and actually land

258
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:08,609
[Applause]

259
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:13,439
[Music]

260
00:11:08,609 --> 00:11:24,129
that's right no other reason

261
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:26,169
Lennie's pizza get ready to quit school

262
00:11:24,129 --> 00:11:27,879
and just pay 20 bucks a month because

263
00:11:26,169 --> 00:11:30,339
that's all you really need there's some

264
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:32,439
amazing quotes from this interview that

265
00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:34,809
Jake did with variety as well where he

266
00:11:32,439 --> 00:11:36,579
was saying I was like why are we sitting

267
00:11:34,809 --> 00:11:38,919
in class right now learning the

268
00:11:36,579 --> 00:11:40,589
quadratic formula when we should be

269
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:43,959
learning about taxes and insurance

270
00:11:40,589 --> 00:11:46,109
teacher please I need to learn about

271
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:49,720
taxes and insurance right now

272
00:11:46,109 --> 00:11:51,639
he said like that where's my taxes huh

273
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,679
you know for this quadratic formula

274
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:55,869
I need financial freedom I am I supposed

275
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:58,329
to get it Jake Paulus it reason why no

276
00:11:55,869 --> 00:12:00,160
one no one likes youtubers it's just

277
00:11:58,329 --> 00:12:01,809
like well I'm probably a guilty as well

278
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,029
never mind and then he says that he

279
00:12:01,809 --> 00:12:05,919
dropped out of school at 11th grade

280
00:12:04,029 --> 00:12:08,799
completing the diploma through an online

281
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:11,139
course I just got the answer from a

282
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:13,869
cheat site and put it in and didn't have

283
00:12:11,139 --> 00:12:16,239
to do any work why you're so epically

284
00:12:13,869 --> 00:12:17,949
smart Jake I bet you were probably the

285
00:12:16,239 --> 00:12:21,309
smartest kid in the class weren't you

286
00:12:17,949 --> 00:12:23,290
I'll wait you say you are oh this is

287
00:12:21,309 --> 00:12:25,449
sweet talking about this our education

288
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:27,249
system it's worthless worthless

289
00:12:25,449 --> 00:12:28,689
I'm fed up I don't know how to cap on

290
00:12:27,249 --> 00:12:31,119
life maybe you and your school you'll

291
00:12:28,689 --> 00:12:34,059
learn how to write Jesus Christ is mess

292
00:12:31,119 --> 00:12:34,569
if you're confused at what the event is

293
00:12:34,059 --> 00:12:36,489
tomorrow

294
00:12:34,569 --> 00:12:38,350
basically I'm sick of our education

295
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:40,360
system and how is teaching kids zero

296
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:43,839
real life skills for them to secure

297
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,949
their own their their own future this is

298
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,110
embarrassing

299
00:12:44,949 --> 00:12:48,999
I'm creating a movement for everyone who

300
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:50,739
wants to take life into their own hands

301
00:12:48,999 --> 00:12:52,839
and learn real life skills from actual

302
00:12:50,739 --> 00:12:55,809
professionals why are kids sitting in

303
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:58,059
film class film learning from a teacher

304
00:12:55,809 --> 00:13:00,910
has never even made a film these

305
00:12:58,059 --> 00:13:02,169
dumbasses and that's just one example he

306
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:03,579
hasn't made any more don't worry guys

307
00:13:02,169 --> 00:13:05,980
that's just one example there's no

308
00:13:03,579 --> 00:13:07,989
there's no need to refute it cuz he's

309
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:10,780
got a whole backlog of ideas and

310
00:13:07,989 --> 00:13:12,190
arguments here it is I was the kid in

311
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:15,960
class I like how we capitalized so

312
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:19,390
listen it who was the smartest doubt

313
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:21,760
okay couldn't apply myself because I

314
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:23,710
thought it was so stupid to be sitting

315
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,050
there I thought they was so stupid to be

316
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:28,330
sitting there it's all we are thought

317
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:32,080
where are my taxes where's my insurance

318
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:33,640
classes it's so disingenuous to put

319
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,800
forth like this is what you're

320
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:37,630
passionate about when in reality the

321
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,430
only thing Jay Paul has shown himself to

322
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:41,830
be passionate about is making money

323
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:44,890
Jake Paul is the kind of celebrity that

324
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:47,080
doesn't have any real value so all they

325
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:49,870
do is they project this image of wealth

326
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:51,580
and now he's monetizing that to get more

327
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:53,260
money he's like he's stuck in this loop

328
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:55,180
where he has to pretend that he it's all

329
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:57,340
about money to make more money but in

330
00:13:55,180 --> 00:14:00,040
reality you could replace Jake poll with

331
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:02,320
anything or anyone it wouldn't make a

332
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:05,290
difference he's literally empty and no

333
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,540
one the message is fine like I agree

334
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:09,670
that so much of the school system is

335
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:11,680
outdated but what the [ __ ] is jake paul

336
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:14,260
gonna teach you about this or so bozo

337
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,210
some composer you never heard about like

338
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:18,250
i said before there's a ton of actual

339
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:20,560
inspiring legitimate people that you can

340
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:23,710
listen to on youtube if you want to for

341
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:25,690
free not monthly payment i know this is

342
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:27,190
just another ed flood scam i don't need

343
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:28,630
to tell you or because you already know

344
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:30,550
it this is a complete [ __ ] there's

345
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:31,660
no point in saying it but i do think

346
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:33,520
it's interesting and these things are

347
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:35,260
