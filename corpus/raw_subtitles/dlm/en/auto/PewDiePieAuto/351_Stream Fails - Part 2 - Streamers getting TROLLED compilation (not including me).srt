6
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:18,690
amazing new set up that is not cooked to

7
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:21,119
close-up at all this is nice and

8
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,250
intimate aren't you enjoying this stream

9
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:26,400
fails that's what we're talking about

10
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:28,890
today I never done one so I can't really

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,009
relate to what we're about to witness in

12
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:34,739
this video good job Felix but here are

13
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:36,989
some epic stream fails of not just

14
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:40,500
people making mistakes but getting

15
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:43,320
trolled epic style by the viewers which

16
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,450
again I cannot relate to cuz I've never

17
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,710
been trolled by the viewers I am just

18
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,719
too smart for that

19
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,399
it just not happen and I want to start

20
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,110
this off with the reason why I'm making

21
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,390
this video because it's my favorite clip

22
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:56,579
of all time a life and just thinking

23
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,109
about it poor innocent girl just wanted

24
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:59,730
to play Minecraft

25
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:01,980
I couldn't find a better quality why is

26
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:03,300
it so bad and someone in the chat I

27
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,600
can't believe how you could sink this

28
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,760
low

29
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,960
it's super worthwhile hold the pickaxe

30
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:14,430
look at lava push Q someone comments

31
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:27,299
it's super worthwhile look at lava and

32
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:32,509
press Q okay oh poor pickaxe she threw

33
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:32,509
it right into the lava this is so sad

34
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:41,820
but wait I guess I mean to me why okay

35
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:45,130

stupid so the person comments again I

37
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:50,470

38
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:52,540

39
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:54,970
first pickaxe you sent into the lava

40
00:01:52,540 --> 00:02:06,190
