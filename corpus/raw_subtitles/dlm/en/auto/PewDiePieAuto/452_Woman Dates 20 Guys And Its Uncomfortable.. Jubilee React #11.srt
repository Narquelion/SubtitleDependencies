to continue this pattern of very very

11
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:51,629
bad men so she has history with bad men

12
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,860
now she's gonna meet 20 is she gonna

13
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:55,020

00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:09,750
group chain and they're all sitting in

16
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:11,880
front of her then watch step on her

17
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:15,390

somebody who's a total debbie downer or

29
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:55,110

financially stable because you're gonna

00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,940
be responsible for shaping their future

97
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:58,500

98
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:02,190

[Music]

119
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:21,300
you put all these standards and no one's

120
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:24,710
left that's hilarious 20 guys and none

121
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:29,130
of them is qualified then maybe I'll

122
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:30,479
just point fingers here at Harlan but

123
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:33,419
there's not that many fingers to point

124
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:37,320
it wait what does I say there's not that

125
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:40,229
many people appointed I thought there

126
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:41,970
would be maybe four guys left she looks

127
00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:44,310
like a really scary teacher that's what

128
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:46,889
I know I'm just judging for my scene I'm

129
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:49,229
sure Keith's lovely she's just a bass

130
00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:53,100
but no I'm scared man but there were

131
00:07:49,229 --> 00:07:58,199
none Oh today I learned that uh my

132
00:07:53,100 --> 00:08:00,479
criteria is not I guess you see as I

133
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:02,820
thought it was but I'm okay with that

134
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,530
because you'll never meet that anyone

135
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:07,139
don't like these are values and things

136
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:10,260
that I don't want to bend and change

137
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:12,180
right now so I used to I don't get that

138
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:13,919
I don't get that you're either like

139
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,840
someone or you don't it shouldn't be

140
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,580
like you have to be this person and you

141
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,349
have to be like this because then you're

142
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:22,289
never gonna be satisfied like obviously

143
00:08:19,349 --> 00:08:24,300
everyone is different in so many

144
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:28,409
different ways it's just ridiculous to

145
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:30,510
put this criteria you need to be if

146
00:08:28,409 --> 00:08:32,849
there's any criteria what would I care

147
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:34,260
about like what would I I guess I would

148
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:36,150
want someone that would make me better

149
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:38,010
it's not like you have to be a certain

150
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:39,959
way but I want you to be a type of

151
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:40,560
energy that makes me want to improve

152
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:42,300
myself

153
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,270
I'm surrounded by someone that hates

154
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:47,040
everything and it's really lazy and all

155
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:48,779
that stuff you kind of drag get dragged

156
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,300
into that sphere I think those kind of

157
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:53,730
stuff matter or maybe it's on FISA from

158
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:57,029
you from TOC and they just want all your

159
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:59,040
money and yeah I don't know I really

160
00:08:57,029 --> 00:09:00,300
beat myself up in my past relationships

161
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,810
after they ended cuz I felt like I

162
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:05,820
wasn't good enough but I think I'm at a

163
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:07,709
place in my life right now where I know

164
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,510
what I want and there's nothing wrong

165
00:09:07,709 --> 00:09:12,360
with having these standards

166
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:14,040
you shouldn't have to bend your values

167
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,820
and what you want to please somebody

168
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:20,010
else I like you don't like you

169
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:23,010
it sounds good if she started off with

170
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:24,870
that like yeah I have values and a bad

171
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:27,209
past relationship so I don't want to

172
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:30,269
bend then them based on someone else

173
00:09:27,209 --> 00:09:32,040
okay on paper that sounds nice but you

174
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:32,670
have to be this tall yeah I can't be

175
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,320
you're good to me

176
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:36,779
you can't be this you can't be that it's

177
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,790
like oh god the boys should remove her

178
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:43,070
from the group chat and become friends I

179
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:43,070
agree I second that 100%

180
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:49,800

younger than me is that really she's 25

184
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,649
like they could be the hottest person in

185
00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:00,450
the room and if they tell me they're

195
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:31,529
- he looks like that comedian John

196
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:34,800
Mulaney isn't he a little bit Asian John

197
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:36,899
Mulaney it's John Mulaney Asian no he's

198
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,760

00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:41,790

200
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:45,180

of photo when you're right there but hey

203
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,130
I guess help instead of a Hello I just

204
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:55,950
put hope

205
00:10:52,130 --> 00:11:01,399

206
00:10:55,950 --> 00:11:01,399
Oh girls be thirsty damn

207
00:11:01,769 --> 00:11:21,089
okay I mean that's why they're there no

208
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:22,980
I don't why would you go out on that why

209
00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:25,380
you even asked that question I think I

210
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:27,029
definitely prefer girls who have been in

211
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:29,730
a relationship before or at least maybe

212
00:11:27,029 --> 00:11:31,320
a long-term relationship because they

213
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,940
really kind of know what it's like to be

214
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,380
in relationship and starting something

215
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:46,110
new with somebody who's never had that

216
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:49,410
is a lot harder that's a weird one six

217
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:50,850
months is not that long damn somebody

218
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:52,560
say no they've never been in a six

219
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:54,990
mother really to say damn

220
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,449
yeah probably if someone's like 24 25

221
00:11:54,990 --> 00:12:00,600
and never had more than six months I'd

222
00:11:57,449 --> 00:12:03,240
probably be like yeah guess I'm part of

223
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:06,149
the problem let's see this man's emojis

224
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:09,990

225
00:12:06,149 --> 00:12:13,829
electrical plug nice the hook side waves

226
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:16,320
nice Japanese flag knives he's a weap I

227
00:12:13,829 --> 00:12:20,730

230
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:28,399
sounded Japanese na na kind of leaves

231
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:39,180
clickbait in the bedroom is always fun

232
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,930
for me that sounds like I'm Christian

233
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:44,699
Grey nothing too crazy I don't like like

234
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:47,240
things getting boring I just like

235
00:12:44,699 --> 00:12:47,240
positions

236
00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:53,829
brah my man you gotta be specific at

237
00:12:51,939 --> 00:12:56,319
least at least the other girl looks like

238
00:12:53,829 --> 00:12:58,000
feet choking all right at least I should

239
00:12:56,319 --> 00:12:59,170
respect honesty now my mind is like

240
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,540
alright what the hell does this guy want

241
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:04,180
why does it bother me I don't care if

242
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:06,459
you're asking if I'll suck your toes

243
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:08,290
sure I'll try anything once

244
00:13:06,459 --> 00:13:14,560
Lily no one asked that you you

245
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:18,879
understand it's about any toe sucking

246
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:28,269
Lily oh yeah this is online land consent

247
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:31,050
I think this new wise I have zero

248
00:13:28,269 --> 00:13:31,050
preference I

249
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:43,950
and I'm not the racist did I mention

250
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:47,380
that I find everyone equal I think I

251
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:50,830
don't even see skin I see only muscles

252
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:53,920
and blood veins really it's just who I

253
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:56,710
am I'm kind of superior in that sense

254
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,960
definitely prefer girls who are either a

255
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:00,760
couple inches taller than me or shorter

256
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,260
I don't mind it when it goes a little

257
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:04,930
bit taller than me but if it's over like

258
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:15,340
two inches maybe what a difference in

259
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:17,680
the height preference conversion rate

260
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:18,550
one inch equals two point fifty to four

261
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,950
centimeters

262
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:23,850
okay so I'll just do red with two point

263
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:26,350
fifty four times big baby like white

264
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:29,880
I'll just do that in my head I guess

265
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:32,080
they have a phone Felix okay I'm sorry I

266
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:36,370
don't like you and girls believe in

267
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:38,650
horoscopes all the girls are out I take

268
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:40,600

269
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:43,090
come on yes I'm making that general

270
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:46,570
assumption and a half the population but

271
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:49,090
it is true and tell me if I'm right

272
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:49,660
because he feels someone's like oh I'm a

273
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:52,180
Libra

274
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:54,070

275
00:14:52,180 --> 00:15:02,710

horoscopes and then dreams fine

325
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:34,750
