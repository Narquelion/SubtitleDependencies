00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,759
i

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:17,520
knew it i knew it

4
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:21,560
damn it feels good to be right oh

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:24,320
oh oh i uncovered a scam

6
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,439
unintentionally that's right for those

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,599
who don't know

8
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,480
the other day i did a video where i

9
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,519
tried out

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,079
a 20 whiskey or a seven hundred dollar

11
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:36,480
whiskey and i never tried the 700

12
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,320
once before and i you know i pride

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,440
myself in my whiskey tasting i don't

14
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,000
drink anymore

15
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,960
but i still know a good whiskey if a

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,480
whiskey's been aged

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,000
23 years i know i'm able to identify it

18
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,079
now even though it was super

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,440
embarrassing i preferred

20
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,440
the 20 whiskey

21
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,079
yeah that's the bushido much richer

22
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,640
flavor

23
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,320
they have to taste hits way more first

24
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,760
when they hit your tongue it's not that

25
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,320
much difference

26
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,280
but the flavor develops differently did

27
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,159
i get it right

28
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,080
no did i got it wrong no [ __ ] way i

29
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,000
went on this whole [ __ ] preach

30
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,280
are you serious i didn't mean that i

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,280
just seemed like these and then

32
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,320
that was checked but they said more look

33
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,360
out

34
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,360
yeah this is the jameson

35
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,400
are you kidding me 20 pound whiskey

36
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,920
i i decided you know what this is

37
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,640
embarrassing

38
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,000
i'm ashamed but that was my opinion i

39
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,799
should post it anyway

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,159
even if people laugh at me well turns

41
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,560
out i was right

42
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,680
this seven hundred dollar whiskey is not

43
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,840
real whiskey

44
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,360
they literally just age it in a barrel

45
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,399
it's chochu or whatever

46
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:58,079
shorshu it's not real whiskey it's 80

47
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,759
uh liquor that they rebranded in america

48
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,680
and they upped the price they put a

49
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,240
bunch of samurai [ __ ] on it

50
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,000
they're like oh bushy though oh now it

51
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,479
not it's 23 years

52
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,640
it's insane i can't believe we uncovered

53
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,080
this so apparently this is quite common

54
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,319
it's not illegal to do what they're

55
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,160
doing because we clearly need like

56
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,599
stricter restriction on what is

57
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,200
qualified as a whiskey

58
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:22,879
but do not i repeat do not spend 700

59
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,120
on that because that is not what it's

60
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,120
worth and it's not what it tastes like

61
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,840
because jameson tasted better

62
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,680
and i'm so glad this had a wholesome

63
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,400
