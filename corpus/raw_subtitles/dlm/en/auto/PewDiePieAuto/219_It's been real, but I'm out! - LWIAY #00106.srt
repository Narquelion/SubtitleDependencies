I'm always there Google don't suicide

119
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,620
yourself guys you'll die Bing dying is

120
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:46,150
bad and all but at least he makes things

121
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,539
more interesting wait I actually said

122
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,520
that

123
00:05:46,539 --> 00:05:50,530
what the [ __ ] context was behind that

124
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:53,680
feelings so I'm trying to make it harder

125
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:56,169
for myself but I think what I meant to

126
00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:04,090
say was war is bad and all I think more

127
00:05:56,169 --> 00:06:06,100
is don't listen to bang

128
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:08,110
don't listen to Bing you can tell my

129
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:10,330
Asia Said's catching up with me guys

130
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:11,530
dying makes life really interesting if

131
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:13,060
you would live forever

132
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:14,770
where's the motivation to do anything

133
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:17,560
learning instruments you can do that in

134
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:19,210
500 600 years or so continuing to do

135
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,070
nothing instead you have only a few

136
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:22,660
decades time to do the things you want

137
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:25,270
before you die and make them matter this

138
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:27,220
time the better answer well hot diggity

139
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:29,560
damn that's some big peepee brain right

140
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:32,680

141
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:35,740
how we see PewDiePie how pretty pie sees

142
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:39,130
us I I do have a camera I don't have a

143
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:41,290
webcam I know that's a surprise

144
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:44,380

00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:44,860
incredibly dumb but still big PP well

146
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:47,410
done

147
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:49,419
so me and my professor have a tradition

148
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:51,490
to draw each other's memes on the exams

149
00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:54,190
when the teacher gives you an extra

150
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:56,500
point for drawing a me stalks when you

151
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:58,600
are a teacher and you have the power to

152
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,009
decide whether to give an extra point or

153
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,350
not reality

154
00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:07,030
- can't be whatever I want he got an

155
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:09,160
extra point that's crazy

156
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:11,820
writing an essay intro in first

157
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:14,520
