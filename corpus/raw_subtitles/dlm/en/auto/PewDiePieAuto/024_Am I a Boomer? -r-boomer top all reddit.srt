change we can make a difference making a

85
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:38,310
real difference is this way voting the

will be voting that's true it's like

90
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,800

00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:55,200
you remove the vote and you just change

92
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,690

who didn't know what a visco girl is

309
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,020
what is that it's like one of the news

310
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:17,300
like subcultures it's like the girls

00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:26,630
hydro flask and they say and they say

313
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:28,550
and I heard this yeah this goes like in

314
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:35,360
photo editing app it's become like a

315
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:37,910
subculture I've been seeing some words

316
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:42,710
in my comments that I need to ask you

317
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:44,990
all about so like visco girl

318
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:50,990
I don't know that's the SEO girl or

319
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:52,610
disco girl or schist kiss-kiss have no

320
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:57,160
idea what the hell that is

321
00:15:52,610 --> 00:16:01,640
and one there's one that says and I hope

322
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:04,160
I got a feeling that somehow knows this

323
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,990
is a way inappropriate so you're

324
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:19,970
probably getting a really big food out

325
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:22,160
of this so let me know I don't get it

326
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:24,110
though I still don't understand what's

327
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,209
funny about it it's not funny it's just

328
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:28,700
like an actual subculture like I never

329
00:16:26,209 --> 00:16:29,420
seen it is this normal white girls I

330
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:32,089
don't get it

331
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:33,790
it is like a white girls that's what I

332
00:16:32,089 --> 00:16:37,520
don't understand

333
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:40,310
explain it but I can't explain it man

334
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:43,370
it's too complex I don't get it

335
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:44,690
oh is it like amber Chamberlain is that

336
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:46,040
it I think it's kind of image handling

337
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:49,700
yeah but I guess he did a video about

338
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:53,320
she already done a video yeah no no no

339
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:57,680
nurse I said slip off his testicles

340
00:16:53,320 --> 00:17:03,350
spectacles spectacle blonde with big

341
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:05,630
tits dumb yeah you can't be blonde and

342
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:07,429
attractive it and have any brain no this

343
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:09,410
is how that works now that's a Boomer

344
00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:11,179
sentiment yeah I swear people tried to

345
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:13,370
make me think that when I was a kid yeah

346
00:17:11,179 --> 00:17:16,819
attractive people were automatically

347
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:21,890
suited or really buff people too right

348
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:23,480
yeah yeah this I wonder what boomer

349
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:29,260
values you still have it you don't

350
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:29,260
realize yeah yeah shaped by society

351
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:32,840
I think Burma's forget that washing

352
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:34,850
machines and dryers were invented during

353
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,470
their lifetime because all they cared

354
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:39,140
about was making their own daily lives

355
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:41,690
easier it tries to washing using the

356
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:43,850
very latest technology a combination of

357
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:47,030
solar and wind power

358
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:49,070
she says wasn't their thing we're like

359
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:51,679
the the dishwasher was actually a really

360
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:53,809
important invention for the women to be

361
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:56,300
out of the kitchen yeah and here boomers

362
00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:59,390
are like Oh

363
00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:02,000
we're just wind oh you can wash your

364
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:04,010
dishes with your hands yeah yeah such

365
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,429
backward-thinking yes technology bad is

366
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:12,260
probably the worst boomer value yeah

367
00:18:06,429 --> 00:18:14,330
although well we have all these taken

368
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:16,250
howl idea right but like is anyone

369
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:18,080
happier from it I was talking to someone

370
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:20,000
about this the other day have you

371
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,070
thought about how much easier it's like

372
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,870
sleep around now because of like the

373
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:25,370
apps and stuff compared like only people

374
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:37,820
who were really I don't sleep around Joe

375
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:39,230
I know guys my tinder no but I just

376
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,610
thought about that how like that's gotta

377
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:41,870
have made it easier for people want to

378
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:43,760
do that I don't know that's like yeah

379
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:46,490
you can argue it's a broom about you to

380
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:49,610
feel that's not a good thing to be like

381
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:51,470
it's too easy to hook up now yeah I

382
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:53,720
think you had to be like good in like

383
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:55,280
club since oh yeah yeah and now you can

384
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,920
find someone on your same page yeah

385
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:00,230
easier yeah this one was born without an

386
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:07,160
umbilical cord it's because he's from

387
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:09,350
the wireless generation the police just

388
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:12,200
pulled me over him and said papers I

389
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:13,610
said scissors I win and drove off I

390
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:23,780
think he wants a rematch

391
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:26,240
he's been my English textbook is

392
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:27,710
terrible I'm hitting a nail I'm hitting

393
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,450
it again I'm hitting it a third time

394
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:34,250
things would move much quicker if you

395
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:36,260
didn't tweet every nail feelings if we

396
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:43,510
do it every stroke he's tweeting he's

397
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:47,510
three thing to doing everyone all right

398
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:50,210
okay millennial dad's have terrible DIY

399
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:59,240
skills half of them own don't own a

400
00:19:50,210 --> 00:20:02,600
stepladder cordless drill half don't

401
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:04,790
have a cordless drill your dad oh you're

402
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:07,809
right when you were dad probably and

403
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:07,809
you're never set of screwdrivers

404
00:20:08,269 --> 00:20:17,109
what bothers me yes again someone to do

405
00:20:15,169 --> 00:20:20,320
it I that's what I do was the time yeah

406
00:20:17,109 --> 00:20:22,820
so you'll be that millennial dad huh

407
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,469
proud millennial dad yeah I feel like

408
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:26,359
it's so embarrassing though when you get

409
00:20:24,469 --> 00:20:29,179
someone there and it's literally like

410
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:30,919
two seconds and it's done mm-hmm because

411
00:20:29,179 --> 00:20:33,349
you don't know like the basic thing to

412
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:35,089
do so I actually in my old flat I used

413
00:20:33,349 --> 00:20:41,109
to actually get a guy in to change the

414
00:20:35,089 --> 00:20:45,979
light box so you're not a Boomer at all

415
00:20:41,109 --> 00:20:47,479
I'm just old zoomer is like the thing is

416
00:20:45,979 --> 00:20:52,159
there was like a light over the stairs

417
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:54,320
oh yeah you don't own a step line but

418
00:20:52,159 --> 00:21:01,399
then once it was there once he was there

419
00:20:54,320 --> 00:21:08,239
like so where do kids learn to be so

420
00:21:01,399 --> 00:21:10,249
violent and that one's real I mean like

421
00:21:08,239 --> 00:21:12,079
that's a real comic yeah it's so yeah

422
00:21:10,249 --> 00:21:13,969
that's like one of those boomer ideas

423
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:15,589
that just seems too sick for some reason

424
00:21:13,969 --> 00:21:17,539
it's like it's been disproved like

425
00:21:15,589 --> 00:21:20,629
scientifically so many times it just

426
00:21:17,539 --> 00:21:22,389
doesn't seem to stick no yes like

427
00:21:20,629 --> 00:21:25,700
violence did not exist before movies

428
00:21:22,389 --> 00:21:27,259
yeah balances come down but kids are

429
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:30,289
playing video games so video games bad

430
00:21:27,259 --> 00:21:33,049
video game bad like what's he has like a

431
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:35,119
bomb in the house I guess yeah what's

432
00:21:33,049 --> 00:21:36,529
yeah I mean if yeah if you let your kid

433
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:37,759
have a bomb in the house or like

434
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:41,959
whatever them I got your rating to

435
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:44,499
answer why is he so ugly yeah the kid

436
00:21:41,959 --> 00:21:47,419
looks like an a dog yeah it's got like

437
00:21:44,499 --> 00:21:49,489
like this but I feel I gotta say I feel

438
00:21:47,419 --> 00:21:51,889
like it's again it's equally cringy when

439
00:21:49,489 --> 00:21:56,570
kids be like no but this is car video

440
00:21:51,889 --> 00:21:58,070
games at all no I don't think it's asked

441
00:21:56,570 --> 00:22:00,440
when you when you've got science on your

442
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:02,899
side but yeah I still think it's cringy

443
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,919
like overtly trying oh yeah you do it

444
00:22:02,899 --> 00:22:05,450
like really great I think it's just

445
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,759
cause buyers at oh you're all

446
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:09,709
scientifically wrong like who cares

447
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:12,079
could you see that like some stores

448
00:22:09,709 --> 00:22:14,869
stopped selling like video games after

449
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:17,659
like a shooting and stuff okay yeah

450
00:22:14,869 --> 00:22:18,610
that's I think I think it when I read it

451
00:22:17,659 --> 00:22:20,650
it was when

452
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:22,990
Trump said something and then everyone

453
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:26,080
on Twitter be like I've played video

454
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:29,140
games my whole life I never thought of

455
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,490
doing anything violence that's like yeah

456
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:32,320
it's more like how you say it I guess

457
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:33,700
then yeah that's a good point yeah cuz

458
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,610
then you're putting yourself into it and

459
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:39,160
be like I'm so good I'm not bad at all

460
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:40,900

insightful I learned a lot about myself

502
00:25:13,539 --> 00:25:18,409
I guess I share a lot more with the

503
00:25:16,789 --> 00:25:20,539
boomers than I thought I guess it just

504
00:25:18,409 --> 00:25:24,950
comes from being 30 are you sure you're

505
00:25:20,539 --> 00:25:26,510
30 I am 31 but not married yet oh yeah I
