get into area 51 and see another portal

46
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:14,410
what that would be awesome it's just

47
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:17,080

the manager of area 51 has anyone ever

52
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,330
asked that has anyone pulled that card

53
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,790
yet say there's a lot of ways to attack

54
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:33,190
here there's a lot of options but most

55
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:35,080
importantly what are we gonna get out of

56
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:37,780

genetically mutated prototype soldiers

109
00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:36,130
the US government has been working on

110
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,810
Oceanside and area 51

111
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:40,030
we do have to think about what we

112
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:42,580
actually do inside there's gonna be many

113
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:44,229
bosses and battles when you manage to

114
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,669
store Arif if they want to find aliens

115
00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:47,979
but you also end up finding something

123
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:10,219
to storm area 51 but they forgot that

124
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:15,599
