1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,820
I gotta be quiet guys where am I

2
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:13,950
doko desuka that's right everyone I am

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,410
in nihaan did you guess it from my neck

Oh headphones that's right I'm somewhat

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:22,080
of a Japanese I gotta be really quiet

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:24,779
this time the rule is simple you laugh

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,640
you lose and this time bring a new

8
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:28,439
meaning to the game cuz I don't know if

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,279
my neighbors will be pissed off so I'm

10
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,199
trying to keep it down

11
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,360

this feels more special

15
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,829
the really hardest part of this

16
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,719
challenge is the fact that I don't have

17
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:45,450
any gene fuel that's right I forgot to

18
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:48,989

00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:50,640
without G fuel this is impossible I know

20
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:53,010
