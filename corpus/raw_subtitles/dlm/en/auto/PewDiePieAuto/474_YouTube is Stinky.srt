1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,970
annoying things youtubers do what's up

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:07,170
everyone it's me the least annoying

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:10,080
youtuber there is

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:12,420
I just wanted to ethically rant today

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,219
about some stuff that I noticed

6
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,320
youtubers do that is kind of weird

7
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:18,090
there's a lot of it that doesn't

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,650
necessarily get addressed a lot it

9
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,090
probably does but regardless I'm gonna

10
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,640
go through it and then I'm gonna ask you

11
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:26,130
guys what your pet peeves I guess we can

12
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,769
call it our and we'll compare if we have

13
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:31,500
the same ok number one this is very

14
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:33,840
specific but I find it as a perfect

15
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,070
example of youtubers have no idea what

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,320
they're doing so they're just copying

17
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:40,739
everyone else we have Sniper Wolf with a

18
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:43,020
tiny tiny bit of red than the in the

19
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:45,260
thumbnail for whatever reason people

20
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:48,239
think this is something worth

21
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:50,730
replicating this tiny bit of red in the

22
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,920
background of the photo that's what's

23
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,800
gonna get you views apparently people

24
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,980
just should I pick any other color than

25
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,840
this shade of gray red now now it has to

26
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,239
be that one oh I tried all other colors

27
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,070
they don't give use ok sure

28
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:08,430
I like how this started as well with

29
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:10,470
sniper wolf and was a Z who practically

30
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,570
looks so similar anyway and they have

31
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,250
the exact same thumbnail you know that

32
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:16,590
photo of a human where it's like all

33
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:19,130
faces combined this is gonna be every

34
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:21,509
youtuber eventually what is that yeah

35
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:23,820
this is how all youtubers are gonna look

36
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:26,369
in the future I know not that important

37
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:28,200
Felix no one cares it just showed so

38
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:30,840
much to me alright bringing up the

39
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,640
second point which is the description of

40
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,770
videos I hate the description of videos

41
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,509
I don't care about it but it's one of

42
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,009
those things as a youtuber you have to

43
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:40,079
write a description because it's so

44
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:42,479
important for people to find your video

45
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,890
a lot of channels will I mean I don't

46
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,229
even know how it works to be honest

47
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,970
previously used to be tanks as a way to

48
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:49,350
find a video through searches and it

49
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:51,000
didn't have to be in your face you can

50
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:52,439
just put in a bunch of tags yadda yadda

51
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,630
yadda no one cares

52
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:56,310
but now everyone just put the same tags

53
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,659
in every video so you're kind of lost

54
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,280
this effect so now what YouTube wants

55
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:02,640
you to do is to write a description in

56
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,280
your video and it's so obnoxious look at

57
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,129
this I mean clearly it works view rise

58
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,530
but after child well clay made the video

59
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:12,420
spining just rock band signs record deal

60
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,620
at the product says Oracle rose music

61
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:17,190
video goes viral

62
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:19,799
by quaint created our Regina and pc-9

63
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:23,190
brothers and sister Kris my test results

64
00:02:19,799 --> 00:02:25,620
from upgraded hacker PC 7 1 P 1 5 to

65
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:28,140
reveal sibling true that was a quote ok

66
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,909
and then you'll upload it quote upgraded

67
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:32,400
hacker defeat it's a way to get all the

68
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:35,069
videos recommended by putting the title

69
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,110
of other videos in this one searching

70
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:39,180
for technology to destroy projects or go

71
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:41,340
on the expulsion project Soria YouTube

72
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,560
channel example project circle member PC

73
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,879
9 and also named merit started big and

74
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,900
I've read half of it

75
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:52,019
watch my awesome friend videos know

76
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:53,879
they're teaming up now oh no I think

77
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:55,739
this annoys me so much because it's it's

78
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:57,780
not about the content it's more about

79
00:02:55,739 --> 00:03:00,540
how you can optimize your videos in a

80
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:03,930
way that people will be will watch it

81
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:05,609
it's loud it grabs attention and people

82
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,349
don't question why they watch it it's

83
00:03:05,609 --> 00:03:09,840
just there in front of you because it

84
00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:12,329
hits every single mark or what YouTube

85
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,190
is asking for if we click on any video

86
00:03:12,329 --> 00:03:16,290
that just starts immediately super

87
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:18,019
intensive then it's a it should be

88
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:22,310
assigned to just click off immediately

89
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:22,310
you're not gonna get fulfilled from this

90
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,849
[Music]

91
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:28,889
I'm told by YouTube as well that I

92
00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:33,629
should write a better description and I

93
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:36,900
just cannot care less I told boohoo

94
00:03:33,629 --> 00:03:38,849
right it's just so lame which brings to

95
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,769
the third point which is YouTube

96
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:43,980
thumbnails I mean this has a long

97
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:46,349
history back with like I think Tobuscus

98
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:49,109
and with like same face every single

99
00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:51,120
thumbnail for whatever reason having

100
00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:52,650
just this face in the thumbnail will

101
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,989
will do the trick do you know how

102
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:57,660
annoying it is I'm so sick of it but

103
00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:59,099
it's so useful for people to know hey

104
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:00,419
it's you in the thumbnail you know what

105
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:03,060
from now on this is gonna be my

106
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:04,889
thumbnail for every video because that's

107
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:08,099
how I feel inside when I make these

108
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:10,079
thumbnails so awful it's so cringy I

109
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:14,220
like this david dobrik one as well just

110
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:14,579
like just mirror the image I can't be

111
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,709
bothered

112
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:18,660
it's too soul-crushing to take another

113
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:20,699
photo I'll just mirror the photo

114
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:23,280
I like that clearly it works no one

115
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:25,020
cares I think after you it's fine but

116
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,760
after you've done like a thousand of

117
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,120
these stupid faces in the thumbnail it's

118
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,310
like

119
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,580
I'm done I'm done I'm officially done

120
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:34,590
I've done too many number four videos

121
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,570
that have a question that I could not

122
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:37,860
give less [ __ ] about but I'll watch the

123
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:41,100
whole thing and I'm thoroughly enjoyed

124
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:43,490
it always annoys me like I've learned a

125
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:46,080
lot but I will never need to know this

126
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:49,229
it's the world running out of helium I

127
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,639
don't care but it was a great video okay

128
00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:53,910
I want to see what shows up if I search

129
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:57,630
why why Costco is cheaper than Amazon I

130
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:59,400
don't care just don't click on it Felix

131
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:01,620
you clearly don't understand my

132
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:04,350
impulsive habits that I can't control

133
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:06,210
okay why Joe Rogan won't do hot ones I

134
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:09,960
mean I want to know but I'm sure the

135
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:13,320
answer is pretty unimportant why planes

136
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:14,880
don't fly I don't care stop stop roping

137
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,700
me into questions that I don't care

138
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,860
about stop giving me knowledge and stuff

139
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:22,080
I don't like it it needs to end what is

140
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:24,870
his budget v socks why doesn't the heart

141
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,919
get tired I don't care I don't care I

142
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:28,650
don't care

143
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:31,260
stop asking questions in your titles I

144
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:35,940
don't care I don't care do I have to say

145
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:37,590
it more why your aim still sucks I don't

146
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:39,270
want to know I don't want to know I

147
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:41,250
found this when I accidentally clicked

148
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:44,900
on this video and it's number five

149
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:49,719
pointless or rewards for videos no

150
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:54,279
Daniel or Regina the winner will get

151
00:05:49,719 --> 00:05:56,049
oh cool why it's almost like this night

152
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:57,999
you need to know you can't just do

153
00:05:56,049 --> 00:06:00,069
anything now there has to be like 10

154
00:05:57,999 --> 00:06:02,499
grand on the line or something when

155
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:04,149
there gets 5 billion and they're never

156
00:06:02,499 --> 00:06:07,229
satisfied in the end when they win

157
00:06:04,149 --> 00:06:09,669
they're like oh cool this is awesome

158
00:06:07,229 --> 00:06:11,709
it's the same video regardless it's not

159
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:13,299
like it's amping up anything but oh my

160
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:14,319
god they win ten thousand so I have to

161
00:06:13,299 --> 00:06:16,329
watch the video and see what their

162
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,709
reaction is reaction alright cool thanks

163
00:06:16,329 --> 00:06:20,249
what are you gonna do with this I'll

164
00:06:17,709 --> 00:06:22,809
maybe pay off student loans okay cool so

165
00:06:20,249 --> 00:06:25,179
many youtubers do this now with like pay

166
00:06:22,809 --> 00:06:27,339
ten thousand pay ten thousand all right

167
00:06:25,179 --> 00:06:29,379
don't get me wrong I think people can do

168
00:06:27,339 --> 00:06:31,059
it right and a lot of people do but it's

169
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:32,709
one of those concept that clearly works

170
00:06:31,059 --> 00:06:35,289
on YouTube and everyone just take that

171
00:06:32,709 --> 00:06:36,939
concept and they do it so lazily lazily

172
00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:38,709
is that a word I don't know what did I

173
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:41,079
see recently oh yeah morgues does that

174
00:06:38,709 --> 00:06:43,269
in line last two life wins twenty

175
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:45,669
thousand it's like it's like the bank

176
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:47,739
gives out loans to its elves yeah I won

177
00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:50,079
twenty thousand from my own money that's

178
00:06:47,739 --> 00:06:52,089
awesome cool number six

179
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:53,649
I think I'm we're up to six likes on the

180
00:06:52,089 --> 00:06:54,849
screen it's the thing that's happening

181
00:06:53,649 --> 00:06:57,219
now and it's one of those things where I

182
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:59,829
makes me feel so [ __ ] old leave a

183
00:06:57,219 --> 00:07:03,009
like liked subscribe cool the video just

184
00:06:59,829 --> 00:07:05,619
began why stop it I get it it's like a

185
00:07:03,009 --> 00:07:07,509
way less intrusive way to get people to

186
00:07:05,619 --> 00:07:09,069
like the video this is another one of

187
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:10,659
those things that clearly works and

188
00:07:09,069 --> 00:07:12,669
everyone just does it and now it's a

189
00:07:10,659 --> 00:07:13,269
standard and it's just annoying and I

190
00:07:12,669 --> 00:07:14,949
don't like it

191
00:07:13,269 --> 00:07:17,050
boomer this is a Boomer wrenched by you

192
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:18,909
to basically which brings me into the

193
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:21,610
next one is when a lot of times you'll

194
00:07:18,909 --> 00:07:23,529
watch like a video just to understand

195
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:25,479
how to do something an instruction video

196
00:07:23,529 --> 00:07:27,189
and for whatever reason they'll still

197
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:28,809
tell you okay maybe it's like how do you

198
00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:30,279
fix how do you download this app on your

199
00:07:28,809 --> 00:07:33,009
phone or something stupid I don't know

200
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:35,289
and by the end that I follow me on

201
00:07:33,009 --> 00:07:37,360
Instagram guys no no I'm not gonna

202
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:38,860
follow you in Instagram I mean I could

203
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,739
just ignore you saying that but why

204
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:43,629
would I know your place if you make text

205
00:07:41,739 --> 00:07:45,669
tutorials then maybe people don't give a

206
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:47,800
[ __ ] about your Instagram Jesus Christ

207
00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:50,129
the same with podcast everyone has a

208
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,360
podcast now this is such an epic rant

209
00:07:50,129 --> 00:07:56,589
why does that Noah

210
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:59,919
not everyone hates a podcast if they're

211
00:07:56,589 --> 00:08:01,139
sitting on problem number what are we on

212
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,569
eight or nine

213
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:05,460
it doesn't matter red shadow legends

214
00:08:03,569 --> 00:08:07,560
have you guys heard about raid shadow

215
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:09,900
legends but don't take my word for it

216
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:12,419
take all the reviews that are it has

217
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:15,599
5-meter million reviews and they're all

218
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:17,909

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:20,669
download now you get 50,000 gold

220
00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:23,009
whatever that means and you can also

221
00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:24,479
read shadow legend with me maybe you can

222
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:26,789
find me in the game if you play an

223
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,560
average shadow legends listen I'm not

224
00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:30,539
gonna hate on people getting bright on

225
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,209
YouTube I think it's great but for the

226
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:35,820
sake stop everyone that does raid shadow

227
00:08:33,209 --> 00:08:37,529
legend shoutouts it's the same script

228
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,669
for everyone they've literally just said

229
00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:41,310
okay you need to say all these things

230
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:43,769
and then every raid shadow legend shout

231
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:46,440
out sounds exactly the same it is so

232
00:08:43,769 --> 00:08:48,360
annoying what's this the most immersive

233
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,250
RPG experience you'll find on a

234
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:56,250

alright

253
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:57,810
those were my pet peeves about YouTube

254
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:59,519
do you agree with them do you not let me

255
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:01,470
know in the comments I'm not gonna read

256
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,630
them anyway I'm kidding I do read

257
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:06,300
comments okay so I asked them Twitter

258
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:07,829
what your pet peeves are about youtubers

259
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:10,019
which I think it's pretty interesting so

260
00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:11,190
let's see talking super slow and it's

261
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:13,610
noticeable they're trying to make the

262
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:13,610
video longer

263
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:19,700
some people on YouTube speak so slow

264
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:22,370
I always watch videos on times to speed

265
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:24,830
and some people speak so slow that even

266
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:26,390
times to makes the video dreadfully slow

267
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:28,250
this is a problem with YouTube in

268
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:30,410
general that YouTube ones longer videos

269
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:32,840
so people drag them out for no reason at

270
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:34,670
all and it's very obnoxious I can't say

271
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,530
that I'm entirely guilt free on this but

272
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:38,030
I've seen the worst examples and it

273
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:40,010
blows my mind that people are okay with

274
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:42,080
it they never really help small

275
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:43,970
youtubers oh I remember when I used to

276
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,980
do that remember that and then people

277
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:48,440
started calling me Nazi for it it's epic

278
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:50,690
that this is why I don't do good things

279
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:53,960
any more unnecessary interest and

280
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:55,520
background information yes this is don't

281
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:57,590
care about your car accident that left

282
00:10:55,520 --> 00:11:00,410
you without a left head just show me

283
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:03,230
that a clean bird so here's the tutorial

284
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:04,940
on how to fix your makeup eckel also

285
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:06,650
guys sorry about the background already

286
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:08,690
in this video we got a little bit of

287
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:10,490
construction going on outside hope that

288
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:14,750
isn't too annoying for you guys in the

289
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:17,380
background anyway also when they have a

290
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:20,690
camera for three years can't the relate

291
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:22,670
can't relate to this at all I also think

292
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:24,830
that I know this is kind of a stupid

293
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:27,410
argument to make but when people get too

294
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:30,050
polished of a setup like a studio and

295
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:32,000
and like super crisp quality camera and

296
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:33,470
and their everything is amazing which is

297
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,570
nice don't get me wrong and they fit

298
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:37,820
certain channels but it almost feels

299
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:39,800
like you kind of lost touch with what in

300
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:44,570
my opinion YouTube is when it's too

301
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:47,180
polish it's almost like I know it makes

302
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:49,010
no sense to say I don't know it's like

303
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:51,020
I'm justifying me being a cheap ass and

304
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:52,700
not buying a proper camera alright it's

305
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:54,650
not a pet peeve really but chorded big

306
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,780
digital put an ad timer in their videos

307
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:59,870
if i want to watch an ad and i can and

308
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:01,190
if I don't want to I can skip to exactly

309
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:03,350
where the video ends more YouTube

310
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:04,940
versity should do that a great way to is

311
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:07,010
to if you're on your phone you can just

312
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:10,760
double tap on the side of the screen

313
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:11,690
most ad reads are either 60 to 90

314
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:14,630
seconds

315
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:16,730
so you just DoubleTap six times and if

316
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:18,230
their ad is still going double tap three

317
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:20,450
times and you're good to go

318
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:23,600
you're welcome gamers starting a podcast

319
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:25,670
there it is for no reason I don't know

320
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,710
why that annoys you so much I like

321
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:29,240
Podcast as much as the next guy but why

322
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:31,220
don't half the people I follow feel like

323
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,710
they need to have their own aimless

324
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:35,240
podcast I ain't got time for that I like

325
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:37,490
this because clearly you can just ignore

326
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,140
it you don't have to consume the podcast

327
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:42,410
it doesn't hurt you in any single way at

328
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:44,420
all but it still annoys me I am still

329
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:47,210
bothered by it this does not affect me

330
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:48,890
whatsoever but I'm still very bothered

331
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:50,810
by it stop it I don't like it

332
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:52,790
skip over really important items in bit

333
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:54,800
on video games well when you're doing

334
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:57,350
commentary and you're focused on keeping

335
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,090
it interesting it is hard to play away

336
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:01,670
as you do when you just watch a video

337
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:04,070
and you just it is different I remember

338
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:05,630
when I play with friends and and one

339
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:07,250
person has to control it it's so much

340
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:09,020
easier to be like you missed that you

341
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:10,670
missed that you missed that I get that

342
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:12,980
it's still annoying but yeah I don't

343
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:15,110
know talking over dialogue in games well

344
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:17,480
it's that dialogues weren't so boring

345
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:19,670
Jesus Christ I gotta say as someone that

346
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:23,270
has played insane amount a story-driven

347
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:25,580
horror and sorry story driven games most

348
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:27,560
game developers aren't writers and the

349
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:32,390
writers that game developers hires are

350
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:34,490
so bad they cannot write it can't it's

351
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:36,470
awful and he just feels like you're

352
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:38,630
having your time wasted I remember

353
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:40,580
watching the documentaries of the of the

354
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:42,230
how they made the halo cutscenes and I

355
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:43,970
find it's so interesting how they kept

356
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:45,920
revision doing it it's a really good

357
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:48,380
service if you watch actually how Bungie

358
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,240
did the original Halo games because

359
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:52,340
their approach to storytelling in the

360
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,680
cutscenes were we are wasting people's

361
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:56,990
time we need to make this as interesting

362
00:13:54,680 --> 00:14:00,110
as we possibly can and I think that is

363
00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:02,000
missed on a lot of games it just feels

364
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:04,550
like they need to drag out the game to

365
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,620
be as long as possible which kind of

366
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:08,000
ties into YouTube in a sense asking

367
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:10,040
people to like and subscribe to their

368
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,510
Channel ten seconds into the video this

369
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,700
is one of those things that just doesn't

370
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:16,250
go away because it clearly works despite

371
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:18,110
how cannabis it is I remember when I

372
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:20,570
started doing YouTube videos and I felt

373
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:22,550
awful just asking for subscribing at the

374
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:24,170
end watch it watch some of my earlier

375
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:26,150
videos I'm like if you've made it this

376
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:30,590
far in the video then maybe consider

377
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:32,540
subscribing and I remember I remember

378
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:34,430
like getting like two or three more

379
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:37,700
subscribers because I used to do that

380
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:40,290
I'm like holy [ __ ] I found a gold mine

381
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:42,030
subscribeto pretty recorded videos maybe

382
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:44,340
it's just me but I don't like the vibe

383
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:46,920
of pre-recording yeah I get this a lot

384
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:48,510
since I do daily videos why don't why

385
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:51,030
can't you just work ahead or why can't

386
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:53,670
you just do that I really don't like it

387
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:55,530
either I think it shows immediately when

388
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:57,450
a video is pre-recorded and it makes it

389
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:59,790
less interesting in a sense I don't know

390
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:01,200
why cuz it's such a subtle thing I only

391
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:03,060
really work ahead if I have no other

392
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,110
choice leave your opinion in the

393
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:06,660
comments below

394
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:08,520
never reads comments this actually

395
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,990
reminds me of another thing I always

396
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,940
read the comments I think I think it's

397
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:13,710
super fun if I don't care about the

398
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:15,480
comments it probably means I don't care

399
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:16,710
about the video I just created to be

400
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,660
honest so I think it's a good way to

401
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:20,670
know if you made an interesting video or

402
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:23,400
not I first thought the whole like a

403
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:25,260
common thing was interesting but now I

404
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:27,330
just find it a really annoying way for

405
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:29,430
youtubers to shell-like positive

406
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:31,170
comments because they all get bumped I

407
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:33,060
wish I could like a comment without it

408
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:34,800
getting bumped up because now it's like

409
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:36,150
I want to find out what people thought

410
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,540
of a video like what the actual

411
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:41,010
democracy opinion of ideas are but then

412
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:43,140
I have to feel like I have to scroll

413
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:44,880
through yeah there's a surgeon out

414
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:46,770
problems I am aware but it's like I have

415
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,050
to scroll past all these like like the

416
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:50,580
Creator like comments to get what two

417
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:51,780
people are actually saying do you

418
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:53,610
understand what I mean so that's why I

419
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:56,700
find myself not even using this feature

420
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:58,440
another one makes a 15 to 20 minute rant

421
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,820
about some other creator how much they

422
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,830
hate their content and despite their

423
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:04,170
views and then say please don't send any

424
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:06,780
hate as it ends as if that's gonna stop

425
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:08,310
the hate well it's kind of annoying as a

426
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:10,440
creator how you can't criticize another

427
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:13,650
channel without a lot of dumb idiots

428
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:15,480
following along and just taking it too

429
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:16,830
far so it's almost like you have to say

430
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,600
it even though it's not gonna have any

431
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:20,100
effect I think that's another pet peeve

432
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,620
I have too is like these channels that

433
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:24,960
are purely based around calling out

434
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:27,210
other channels that's all they do and

435
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:29,430
then they get called out and it's and

436
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:32,010
it's the biggest drama ever how could

437
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:33,690
they say this about me but I think you

438
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:35,910
have a point here with this cuz it's

439
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:38,730
like you're creating this atmosphere on

440
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:41,370
YouTube where it's being overly critical

441
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:43,380
and and things like that putting more

442
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:46,830
emphasis that being overly critical is

443
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:48,030
important when it really isn't oh god

444
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:50,130
I'm a giant hypocrite

445
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:52,800
starting an interesting sentence about

446
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:54,510
themselves or their own life experience

447
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,590
then gets distracted and then they never

448
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:57,630
finished and finished sin

449
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:59,490
yeah going on tangent is something I see

450
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:01,020
a lot of youtubers do especially when

451
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:02,970
you're new because you think it's like a

452
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:05,490
quirky way to speak but it's just really

453
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:07,140
really really really annoying if I ever

454
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:09,449
go on a tangent you may have noticed

455
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:11,910
this I always acknowledge that I go on a

456
00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:14,040
tangent just so people know that yes I

457
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:16,470
am aware this is a different topic but I

458
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:19,020
will get back to the point later a

459
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:20,370
little tip there for newbies and I'm

460
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:22,470
working on something really excited but

461
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:24,060
I I can't tell you yet yes the

462
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:26,280
announcement of it the announcement

463
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:28,140
that's always very interesting just shut

464
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,430
the [ __ ] up then I hope I haven't done

465
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:31,440
this I don't think I do

466
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:33,840
doing too much of it at once and I can

467
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:37,200
lie but pushing games merch and hardware

468
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:42,630
and drinks and figures and a sponsor all

469
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:45,150
in one video it's kind of much in one

470
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:48,120
video I think with games I have another

471
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:49,560
one coming out poopd on 12 of December I

472
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,390
don't give a [ __ ] if you have a problem

473
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:53,490
with it games is really hard to time

474
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:54,930
with other things a lot of times you're

475
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:56,730
working with different people in it I

476
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:58,710
mean it is fair criticism but at the

477
00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:00,420
same time games specifically it's very

478
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:01,920
hard to time say might seem like oh

479
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:04,020
you're pushing a lot right now but it's

480
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,730
literally just a coincidence and I think

481
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:08,730
it's cool stuff too like I don't know I

482
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:10,920
don't care when they try to act poor as

483
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:13,230
familiar I can relate to someone working

484
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:15,510
two jobs and living paycheck to paycheck

485
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:17,640
it like some of them hi there well I

486
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:19,320
mean meanwhile we're all aware of it I

487
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,090
think it makes it worse when they try to

488
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:23,670
hide it and relate to us to some level

489
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:25,980
yet see this a lot youtubers obviously

490
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:27,930
pop off I think it's less than obnoxious

491
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:30,480
than shoving it in your face we'd like

492
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:31,950
look at the car look at the house wait

493
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,390
and when that becomes your content

494
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:35,070
that's a lot more annoying than trying

495
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:36,780
to hide your wealth but I also think a

496
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:39,270
lot of youtubers are scared of showing

497
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:40,500
that they have money to lose that sort

498
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:42,390
of connection with their audience and

499
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:44,520
that's what people do it when I think in

500
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:46,080
reality it doesn't matter what level you

501
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:48,900
are on as long as you're honest about

502
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,640
what you're doing and can express what

503
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:52,500
your fears are people will still

504
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,360
understand it even if they can't relate

505
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:56,580
to it I'll really complain about YouTube

506
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:58,080
and how bad it is to point where it's

507
00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:00,360
not just venting their frustration

508
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,620
anymore it's very tense of complaining

509
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,940
for no reason

510
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:04,920
you have a great house expensive

511
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,960
equipment and an amazing car like a stop

512
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,850
I actually disagree with this to a

513
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,500
certain extent because I think I find

514
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:12,660
myself being more critical about things

515
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,640
that I care about and that doesn't mean

516
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:16,860
I think it's all bad but it's it's

517
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,780
things that I think can make improve

518
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:20,520
it's just giving constructive criticism

519
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:22,440
or pointing out things that I'm annoyed

520
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:24,120
with because I really care about you to

521
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:26,520
me if I bribed by youtubers because I'm

522
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:28,650
I really want you to do well but I think

523
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:30,030
it's small things right I think the

524
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:32,160
thing with YouTube is said eventually

525
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:34,429
because it's ridiculous to care about

526
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:37,350
these tiny little promise all people are

527
00:19:34,429 --> 00:19:39,090
stupid thumbnails and blah blah blah all

528
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:41,429
these all these things they don't mean

529
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:42,720
anything by themselves but after year

530
00:19:41,429 --> 00:19:45,960
after year after year after year

531
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:48,870
each progression of all these things I

532
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:50,490
think we'll find it maybe it's not

533
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:53,130
entirely possible that we find ourselves

534
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:54,600
looking at a YouTube that has been

535
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:56,850
shaped in a way that we don't want it at

536
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,980
all and I think that's my concern when

537
00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:00,750
addressing these things not so much each

538
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:03,090
like I couldn't give a less [ __ ] about

539
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:04,740
what someone uses I said thumbnail well

540
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:07,020
yeah that's my YouTube pet peeves

541
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:09,150
do you agree disagree I read the comment

542
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:11,610
