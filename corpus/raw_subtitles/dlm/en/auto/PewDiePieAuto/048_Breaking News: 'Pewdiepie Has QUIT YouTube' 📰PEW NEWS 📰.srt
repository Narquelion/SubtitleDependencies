Papa's Moria pew die by world's biggest

14
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:47,760
YouTube star PewDiePie quoits saying

15
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:50,100
he's feeling very tired boo-hoo-hoo I

16
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,140
especially like this CNN one because

17
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,059
it's basically PewDiePie who became one

18
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,800
of YouTube's biggest stars before we're

19
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:58,739
seeing his career dogged by allegations

20
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:02,129
of racism and anti-semitism we'll be

21
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:07,260
away for a little while Philip is taking

22
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:10,439
a break because the racism man I can't

23
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:13,049
believe this God blown up I am blown

24
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:15,420
away that it got blown up you know this

25
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:17,549
is posted not just in you if you're from

26
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,070
I don't know anywhere in Europe or

27
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:22,020
whatever the this your local news might

28
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,700
have reported on this as well cuz it's

29
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,979
just one of those stories that caught

30
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,330
fire for whatever reason I think first

31
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:29,400
of all we should look at what I said

32
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:32,159
because I think the contrast is so funny

33
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,380
it was at the end of my last few news

34
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:39,150
Pappas Moria I reported on it taking

35
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:40,979
break from YouTube next year I wanted to

36
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,560
say it in advance because I made up my

37
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:47,840
mind I'm tired I'm tired I'm feeling

38
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,840
very tired I don't know if you can tell

39
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:53,010
just so you know early next year I'll be

40
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:55,170
away for a little while I'll explain

41
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:56,580
that later but I wanted to give head

42
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,620
that's it that's all I said

43
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:01,040
early next year I'll be away for a

44
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:03,240
little while I never said I'm quitting I

45
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,670
said I'm taking a break

46
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,740
I find it so funny because the reason

47
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,990
why I announced it at the end of a video

48
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,550
and I hate the announcement of the

49
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,990
announcement it's so annoying right the

50
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,910
reason why I did it because I didn't

51
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:17,550
want to uh play it I just wanted it to

52
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:18,990
be I didn't want to make a surprise for

53
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:20,850
my audience as well and being like all

54
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:22,470
right some quick thing cuz that's what

55
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:25,350
youtubers would do if they go on a break

56
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:25,950
they would go like I'm quitting PT Pike

57
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:28,350
Waits

58
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,580
you know it's done before I get it but I

59
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:31,440
didn't want to do that I didn't want to

60
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:35,850
make a big deal out of it and then out

61
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:38,340
of all people news media blows it up why

62
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:40,440
do I have more integrity than 50 news

63
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:44,430
media this makes no sense

64
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:46,530
this is all wrong this is all backwards

65
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:49,020
I think this is a common practice in

66
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:51,709
media where well one person got it wrong

67
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:54,420
so we can all just get it wrong right

68
00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:56,610
it's so dumb well there's all these

69
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:58,980
other news stories that reported the

70
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:01,410
wrong news so we can all report I don't

71
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:04,470
want to be all fake news but it is faith

72
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:07,230
that it is I don't know what to tell you

73
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:09,360
yeah I don't understand why no one reads

74
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:12,780
this stuff cuz it's so oh here we go

75
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,950
Disney oh N word Christchurch ad oh

76
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:16,050
there we go

77
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:17,940
we hit them all you just gotta get them

78
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:19,620
all out there in 20 years from now I

79
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:21,870
quit YouTube and do you think people

80
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,550
will post like 20 years ago we

81
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:25,890
remembered he said the N word you guys

82
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:27,600
remember that now I will not give my oh

83
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:29,970
my god this is so obnoxious

84
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,200
somebody pop-ups if I release this game

85
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:33,060
for making food thank you for posting

86
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,820
night it's taking a break from the

87
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:38,970
platform that launched what did they

88
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:40,530
change it the vlogger that's right yeah

89
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:43,080
I don't know why they referred to it as

90
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:44,970
a vlog sorry it had this low quality

91
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,190
version of this because they changed the

92
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:50,030
title he doesn't want to think about

93
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:53,850
vlogging anymore when did I say that

94
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:56,430
they put it in quote right what is that

95
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:59,280
the use those APIs strove to be like oh

96
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:01,239
no it's not an actual quote it's just we

97
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,890
just make it look like it's a quote

98
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:05,720
like what is that look if you look

99
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:07,099
closely we're not actually quoting him

100
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,319
we're just putting a straw

101
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:11,959
it's your stinky fault I'm not a blogger

102
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:14,300
I'm not even a vlogger how do you get it

103
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:16,790
so wrong to be Fred they did change it

104
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:19,389
because I deactivated my Twitter so that

105
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:22,100
now they can put quite straighter

106
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:23,600
because of this I got a lot of boomers

107
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,730
who don't know who I am

108
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,120
and they just read that I made 25

109
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:33,020
million and they're like my job is so

110
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:35,900
hard I don't make 25 million how dare

111
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:37,490
you take our break how could you take a

112
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:40,070
break my job harder

113
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:41,360
and I make less money I feel like I have

114
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:43,729
to explain why I'm taking a break now

115
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,620
just because this is just gonna become

116
00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:47,810
weirder oh wait there was another

117
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:50,030
sentiment I read that was really funny

118
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:52,160
oh here we go here broke the news to

119
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:54,580
heartbroken fans in the latest peer news

120
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,930
video no one on my fans were heartbroken

121
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:58,430
they knew that I was going to take a

122
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:00,080
break anyway and that's why I wanted to

123
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:02,210
make clear that I'm I decided that I'm

124
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,770
gonna do it and the reason why no one of

125
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:05,840
my fans are heartbroken is because they

126
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:09,080
understand that is normal to just take a

127
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:12,410
break I didn't see anyone say oh my god

128
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:14,300
so sad they already knew about it it's

129
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:15,950
so like why are you making that up

130
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,810
alright this is addressed to all the

131
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:19,630
boomers I've been uploading YouTube

132
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:22,100
videos every single day for 10 years

133
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:24,200
YouTube is the kind of job that isn't

134
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:27,080
very stable they're always changing

135
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,729
legislation and rules and policies and

136
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,850
blah blah blah and it's such a new thing

137
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:33,710
that any day it could be over for anyone

138
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:36,050
and and that has been the process for a

139
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:37,490
lot of youtubers in the past so since

140
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:39,650
I'm keeping this opportunity to be a

141
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:41,419
youtuber I've decided I'm gonna make the

142
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:43,280
most out of it no matter what and I've

143
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:46,430
done that and as I think a lot of my

144
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,320
success comes from the fact that I am so

145
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:50,389
consistent with on this platform

146
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,190
I don't pre record videos because I

147
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:54,020
think that loses its touch and a lot of

148
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:56,419
things like that god damn this sounds so

149
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:58,160
preachy it's the point is I thought

150
00:05:56,419 --> 00:05:59,750
YouTube would be over by now for me I

151
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,310
thought I would be last like two years

152
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:03,410
or something like that but here I am I

153
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:04,700
don't want to look at myself another ten

154
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:06,560
years in the future and I've done the

155
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,910
exact same thing as I've done now even

156
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,180
though I really enjoy and love what I do

157
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:12,740
I don't want to look back on my life 20

158
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,610
years later more like oh cool so I just

159
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:16,400
did YouTube

160
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:18,979
and I never ever did anything else it

161
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,599
just seems kind of sad to me another

162
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:22,699
reason I think it's important for anyone

163
00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:24,199
to take a break no matter what job you

164
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:25,939
have it I think that's important and

165
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:29,150
that so much has happened there's here

166
00:06:25,939 --> 00:06:31,219
that I just been building up and up and

167
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:32,750
up and up and I never had never taken a

168
00:06:31,219 --> 00:06:34,729
break before I don't know what it feels

169
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:37,699
like to not worry about uploading a

170
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:39,349
video even when I am away on on certain

171
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:41,150
things I'm still uploading during that

172
00:06:39,349 --> 00:06:42,949
time so I'm just still monitoring the

173
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:45,229
video I'm still making sure everything

174
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:48,110
is good and micromanaging and I've never

175
00:06:45,229 --> 00:06:49,819
just had a full stop so I just want to

176
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:51,409
know what that feels like that's it I

177
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:53,120
didn't want to make a big deal out of it

178
00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:55,129
but now I felt like I was forced to

179
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,169
explain it plus it will be so good

180
00:06:55,129 --> 00:06:59,840
sometime early next year we even kept

181
00:06:57,169 --> 00:07:01,699
the honeymoon five days like even things

182
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,080
like that as a minimum and that's just

183
00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:05,779
kind of sad and I think it's gotten

184
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:07,550
their point where okay it's cool I love

185
00:07:05,779 --> 00:07:09,289
you too but if I want to keep it going

186
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:12,949
I kind of want to change a couple things

187
00:07:09,289 --> 00:07:15,139
and be able to not be so strict with it

188
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:17,690
it's like if you're an entrepreneur you

189
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:19,490
put your heart and soul and and you work

190
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:21,379
your ass off to make this project work

191
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:23,449
that you have right but then once you

192
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:26,090
made it you kind of simmer down and you

193
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:27,349
let it let other people take in control

194
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:29,509
or you might sell the company or

195
00:07:27,349 --> 00:07:32,000
whatever you do but for me the project

196
00:07:29,509 --> 00:07:34,310
it's myself I'm there still I can't sell

197
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,150
myself I can let someone else step in so

198
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:40,430
it's it's so I'm 100 solely dependable

199
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:42,860
if how this channel is doing so it's

200
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:44,210
hard to just slack off do you understand

201
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:46,520
does that make sense

202
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:49,460
cool I don't I didn't make the whole

203
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:51,440
thing to be boohoo me oh it's so hard I

204
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,520
want a break that's not it at all just

205
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,169
want to be clear on that

206
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,300
I understand there's jobs that are way

207
00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:57,889
tougher than mine I'm very happy to be

208
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,900
in the situation I'm not trying to I

209
00:07:57,889 --> 00:08:03,979
don't want people sympathy I never asked

210
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:06,379
for it next news another story that

211
00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:07,339
interested me was the fact that Tana

212
00:08:06,379 --> 00:08:10,009
[ __ ]

213
00:08:07,339 --> 00:08:12,540

218
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,029
[Music]

219
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:41,700

220
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:43,229
platform she's nominated for creator of

221
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,600
the year though she doesn't leave the

222
00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:48,270
platform for traditional media's oh

223
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:51,120
that's hilarious there's such a gap now

224
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:53,370
on YouTube between creators and the ones

225
00:08:51,120 --> 00:09:01,500
that are so desperate to be validated by

226
00:08:53,370 --> 00:09:05,570
by mainstream media more in gray I don't

227
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:13,560
even open that inner beast mr. banks

228
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:16,220
ninja ninja okay Sophia Nygaard I don't

229
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:22,240
know myself

230
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:22,240
EPIK a kids channel Tana mojo Dada [ __ ]

231
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:27,380
well obviously mr. beech is gonna win it

232
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:29,480
I mean he had such an amazing impact

233
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:31,460
this year his growth has been insane

234
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:34,910
he's like the one channel that doesn't

235
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:37,940
have any big controversy he's done good

236
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:40,250
on this on the platform what he's done

237
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:42,950
so many other youtubers try and

238
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:45,050
replicate it's obvious some of the other

239
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:46,700
new animations did they're good okay but

240
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:48,140
as obvious mr. Bies is gonna win it

241
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:51,640
wait did you see the name or that's who

242
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:54,590
you think it is it is not david dobrik

243
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:58,260
I'm sorry David but you've won like

244
00:09:54,590 --> 00:10:07,300
every award tonight it's only fair Tana

245
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:11,450
[Applause]

246
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:13,640
had to come out it in her pajama still

247
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:16,670
made it to the show it's so cringe to

248
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:18,020
rip on Tana like yeah she's insufferable

249
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,410
I don't want to make a whole deal out of

250
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,480
it

251
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:22,280
and I stood right here a year ago and I

252
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,390
literally held Shane Dawson's award and

253
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:27,470
the first thing I said to all of you

254
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:37,100
people was like I will never be creators

255
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:44,210
be here I'm so glad they filmed Gus

256
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:46,850
Johnson's reaction yeah guys when Tanner

257
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:47,540
said I don't deserve this we all felt

258
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:52,520
that

259
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:52,520
[Applause]

260
00:10:54,129 --> 00:10:58,549
she's so humble she doesn't feel like

261
00:10:56,539 --> 00:11:01,729
creator of the air she's so

262
00:10:58,549 --> 00:11:03,619
down-to-earth she's just like us no you

263
00:11:01,729 --> 00:11:06,289
literally don't deserve it that's why

264
00:11:03,619 --> 00:11:08,359
you feel like tanks I'm not actually mad

265
00:11:06,289 --> 00:11:10,519
about this because everyone knows award

266
00:11:08,359 --> 00:11:12,679
shows are just fake anyway it's all

267
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:15,019
politics it's all based on who is there

268
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:16,459
they want to be show that they're giving

269
00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:19,089
away awards to people instead of just

270
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:21,589
having people show up in videos or not

271
00:11:19,089 --> 00:11:24,169
accepting the award at all so the people

272
00:11:21,589 --> 00:11:26,059
that playing to the whole award show

273
00:11:24,169 --> 00:11:28,129
thing are the people that get the award

274
00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:30,259
I've literally gotten award shows

275
00:11:28,129 --> 00:11:32,419
writing to me saying hey we want to give

276
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:34,699
you this award but you have to come

277
00:11:32,419 --> 00:11:37,429
there to get it and it's like no I don't

278
00:11:34,699 --> 00:11:39,769
want it thing it doesn't mean anything I

279
00:11:37,429 --> 00:11:41,419
literally don't even keep my awards that

280
00:11:39,769 --> 00:11:42,289
I have actually gone because I don't

281
00:11:41,419 --> 00:11:43,849
feel proud of them

282
00:11:42,289 --> 00:11:46,519
I think it's it doesn't mean anything

283
00:11:43,849 --> 00:11:48,470
but I think the main reason you know

284
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:50,449
it's fine that it is that way but it is

285
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:52,369
also kind of sad because I think it

286
00:11:50,449 --> 00:11:54,619
could be cool to actually have it as a

287
00:11:52,369 --> 00:11:56,119
way to actually celebrate the people

288
00:11:54,619 --> 00:11:58,339
that did something amazing this year

289
00:11:56,119 --> 00:12:00,439
just like rewind could be something like

290
00:11:58,339 --> 00:12:02,269
that right a celebration of what people

291
00:12:00,439 --> 00:12:04,039
accomplished or made a mark or made an

292
00:12:02,269 --> 00:12:05,720
impact I think that's what it that's

293
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:07,909
literally it it doesn't have to be more

294
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:10,699
than that oh yeah and this was fan voted

295
00:12:07,909 --> 00:12:12,439
as well so it's it's not about who made

296
00:12:10,699 --> 00:12:14,809
the most impact it's who can get the

297
00:12:12,439 --> 00:12:16,639
their audience to vote the most amount

298
00:12:14,809 --> 00:12:18,319
of times right who can get their

299
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,659
audience to give you this award

300
00:12:18,319 --> 00:12:22,939
basically and if that was genuine as

301
00:12:20,659 --> 00:12:25,459
well like if no one if the if it was

302
00:12:22,939 --> 00:12:27,319
just a poll and no one's told anyone to

303
00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:29,359
go there specifically but if you tell

304
00:12:27,319 --> 00:12:30,379
your audience over and over to go and

305
00:12:29,359 --> 00:12:31,639
vote for you then

306
00:12:30,379 --> 00:12:33,829
yeah it doesn't that kind of feed the

307
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:36,679
purpose I'm sure if mr. Bies campaigned

308
00:12:33,829 --> 00:12:38,720
to win he would win but what kind of

309
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:42,140
award is that to accept and it's so

310
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,600
funny to me how he makes the whole thing

311
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:47,479
[Music]

312
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:49,369
as if the award was actually chosen to

313
00:12:47,479 --> 00:12:52,039
her I hate Tana mainly because she

314
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:53,829
promotes drugs to her 14 year old

315
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:57,440
audience I don't know how they are but

316
00:12:53,829 --> 00:13:00,259
like weeds legal they're okay

317
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,569
I'm so high right now and I'm not even

318
00:13:00,259 --> 00:13:04,399
on adderall that was so like I'll take

319
00:13:02,569 --> 00:13:08,209
the go forth of a 20 milligram felt like

320
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:11,560
five milligrams of adderall the blood I

321
00:13:08,209 --> 00:13:11,560
wasn't gonna smoke weed today in those

322
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:18,040

323
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:21,619

I don't mean to bring up a bunch of old

329
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,790
stuff I don't want to do the whole media

330
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:45,889
