00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:51,480
stranding outfit what it's this so that

100
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:55,080
it was so that she can float in the

101
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:56,940
water I thought she was trying to

102
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,430
illegally import what there through the

103
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:01,890
airport why would you do that you're

00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:02,670
still swimming with t-shirt I can't

105
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:04,710
believe this

106
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:06,510
they I've never seen I've actually never

107
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:08,880
watched five-minute crafts I just heard

108
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:13,160
how bad it was they have sixty-two

109
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:16,020
million subscribers what the [ __ ] oh no

110
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:22,830

111
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:25,590
achievement looking at this but bro the

112
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:28,110
video is 11 minutes it's not even five

113
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:30,900
minute craft oh wait I've seen the one

114
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:34,860
where she she makes a spoon out of a

115
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:41,180
spoon look she makes a spoon out of a

116
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:44,010

117
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:47,130
Sexy's oh man ah

118
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:50,880
oh god dy dy

119
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:52,410
I thought DIY would be questioning why

120
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,630
you create something but it makes me

121
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:57,720
wonder why I was created okay it's a

122
00:05:54,630 --> 00:06:00,420
Coca Cola Fanta and sprite dispenser how

123
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:04,200
did how did it work oh yeah that happens

124
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:07,650
all the time okay so the attacks are

125
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:09,000
battery to motor and what else is it all

126
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:10,860
right we got three motors going I'm

127
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,130
really curious how this is gonna make it

128
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:16,980
pour though so you have to screw it to a

129
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:19,950
new code imagine how bored you must be

130
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:21,750
to create something like this this I

131
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:24,090
realize this is for kids right because

132
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:26,130
kids think this is cool but any adult

133
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:26,830
will just be like get that thing out of

134
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:29,030
my

135
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:31,910
it's not the worst thing I've seen on

136
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:35,390
here so far at least serious life hacks

137
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:40,610
serious ones seriously use popcorn okay

138
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:42,410
and then what here we go another five

139
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:45,620
minute craft they got two bricks and

140
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:48,980
they know it's not bricks it's foam clay

141
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:50,360
and you put the clay on the phone what

142
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:53,680
are they gonna make I don't know it's a

143
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:57,800
melon great it's a strawberry why a

144
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:59,720
contact lens solution why and now it's

145
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:03,110
mixed together and now you have a

146
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:07,010
strawberry but why why five minutes

147
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:15,350
Kraft why why did you make this why why

148
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:17,570
why why why what I think I would love to

149
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:20,390
see a compilation of kids recreating

150
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:22,820
this because even the result here is is

151
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:25,040
bad it looks bad I'm curious when

152
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:26,720
someone that all this a tutorial what

153
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:30,230
that looks like cuz it's gotta be some

154
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:34,240
monstrosity fake Sun roof decal for your

155
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:37,280
car wow that looked get so good but why

156
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,440
look more expensive now in case you

157
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:45,020
watch the car from above it looks more

158
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:49,460
expensive personal ice-cream ball or or

159
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:52,220
or you could just take the lid off does

160
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:54,140
anyone like my pack Jesus Christ

161
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:56,510
actually I've seen I've seen one life

162
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:59,510
hack that's useful and it's it's how you

163
00:07:56,510 --> 00:08:02,090
open those super laminated plastic

164
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:03,380
things with a hanger on the top because

165
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:06,080
you can just pull it from the hanger

166
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:08,120
that wasn't useful actually but 99% is

167
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,010
garbage that's how it is isn't it they

168
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,810
reel you in with like one concept that

169
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:13,040
works and you're like holy SH I never

170
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:15,170
thought of that but that's actually

171
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,700
helpful and then you try and find more

172
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:17,930
things because obviously they have to

173
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:21,100
know more things because they know one

174
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:24,200
thing and then it's like 99% microwave

175
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:26,870
microwave mailbox alright another five

176
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:29,420
minute crack or crafts so she went to

177
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:30,480
jail five tricks people have learned in

178
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:32,580
prison that

179
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:35,820
can lit candles how to make crack

180
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:38,190
cocaine you can inhale the fumes oh it

181
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,990
to make a knife is she's gonna break out

182
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:41,640
from prison to that that's that how she

183

196
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:18,540
much worse than any cheap brush that you

retro it's retro it says antique kids

272
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:30,470
and think it's worth more because it's

273
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:32,959
old how to waste a hundred dollars

274
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:35,329
that's always what I want to know why

275
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:38,779
you didn't spend it on old pet bottles

276
00:13:35,329 --> 00:13:41,269
there's the hundred dollar bill okay are

277
00:13:38,779 --> 00:13:45,290
you doing he's getting the blow torch

278
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:47,060
he's laminating it that was it

279
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:50,949
these are just made to piss you off

280
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:50,949
right they could've just use a dollar

281
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:56,660
for the memes

282
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:58,819
I can appreciate Liam Neeson Ilene's

283
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:00,790
come on that's beautiful

284
00:13:58,819 --> 00:14:03,490
someone stole wallet okay

285
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:06,750
so therefore you should use a tampon as

286
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:06,750
a wallet I got it

287
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:15,160
kind of funny though come on

288
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:17,950
I find it acceptable why not just buy a

289
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:19,510
hammer we went through the extensive

290
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:21,520
effort to make a hammer

291
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:23,740
I wonder where five-minute crash draws

292
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:25,390
the line of what not to post because

293
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:26,950
surely they come up with a bunch of [ __ ]

294
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:29,350
that's like--that's if that's a terrible

295
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:31,090
idea we there's no possible way we could

296
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:33,190
use that we're not gonna actually post

297
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:37,440
that but it's like they just don't have

298
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:37,440
that filter they just post it anyway

299
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,970
