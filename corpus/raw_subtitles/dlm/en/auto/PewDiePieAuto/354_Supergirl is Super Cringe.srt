1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,490
supergirl band who funds these shows why

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,710
are they sinking so much money into

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,660
these TV shows that I don't understand

4
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:12,360
why anyone would watch I don't even know

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,759
this show existed apparently it's been

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,440
running for all those five years and

7
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:21,029
they went from ten million viewers to

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:23,150
now going on 1 million viewers let's go

9
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:26,160
through some of my favorite scene from

10
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:29,099
Supergirl this is called the worst CGI

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,080
in TV series so prepare yourself and the

12
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:33,270
best part about this clip is that they

13
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,010
use this as their promo this is what

14
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,750
they want to show what Supergirl looks

15
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:40,700
like to people that haven't really

16
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,700
watched Supergirl prepare yourself

17
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,060
now

18
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:20,540
the thing is like even just even just

19
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:23,330
this special effect are so bad by water

20
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:24,560
it's happening one person that's one

21
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:26,900
thing and then there's another thing and

22
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,790
then good switch it to another thing and

23
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,770
it catches a bullet and then just she

24
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:33,500
changes her beep alright I'll break it

25
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:39,590
that evil the space alien Supergirl was

26
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:47,690
actually construction worker why Donna

27
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:51,920
oh it's so good let's wash it on slow

28
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:58,550
speed Oh God what a hot mess look at

29
00:01:51,920 --> 00:02:00,680
that that's why it's like that really

30
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:02,240
feminist empowering moment in Lord of

31
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,300
the Rings when she's like I am no man

32
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,470
it's a super speed punch what is

33
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,690
happening here are they're supposed to

34
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:12,200
walk through glass or something they

35
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:14,390
look like crystal meth or something look

36
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:17,360
at that yeah they are they're walking

37
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:20,090
through that wow this guy says we came

38
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,480
prepared and prepared immediately gets

39
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:22,480
shot

40
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:28,440
prepared I will have a good clearly

41
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,830
there's been some budget cuts going on

42
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,200
here

43
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:33,960
and I understand this is just one scene

44
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,480
they probably have better CGI this looks

45
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:39,450
like some PlayStation 2 level of CGI

46
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,070
honestly it looks so bad what's really

47
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,990
confusing cuz I kept trying to find like

48
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:45,180
alright are there any more like bad CGI

49
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:48,390
but they actually have like a ton of

50
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:50,730
these where they break down the CGI for

51
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:52,560
the films and just like how much effort

52
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:54,450
and time they spend on it so what

53
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,280
happened they're like yeah this looks

54
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:58,110
cool this doesn't look bad I'm not I'm

55
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,400
not the gonna just like blindly hate

56
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:01,380
something that would be foolish

57
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,510
I wouldn't do that but yeah super girl

58
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:05,640
sucks it sucks it really sucks as you

59
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:06,930
can see by these numbers like just don't

60
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,270
take my word for it

61
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:11,460
just take this drop out alright so

62
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:12,150
here's a cursed video that I loved so

63
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,500
much

64
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,360
I shouldn't this video before it's

65
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:19,790
superheroes without special effects look

66
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:22,200
super silly alright here we go

67
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:24,410
maybe Cara Danvers is tougher than you

68
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,410
think

69
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:35,280
we're not gonna win this today ah dang

70
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:37,320
it better flow away oh wait what she

71
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,670
doesn't fly away are you serious

72
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,130
she doesn't actually have superpowers

73
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:44,430
this is crazy what is your superpower

74
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:46,880
this wears his hands in circles really

75
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:50,640
fast you don't want to mess with me boy

76
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:52,950
you know they are really pros if I was

77
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,560
there I would be laughing non-stop right

78
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:59,780
props to them honestly I could not do

79
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,780
that no way alright service was FX

80
00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:06,379
I mean now I kind of respect the CGI

81
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:16,489
team for making those goofy ass scenes

82
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:17,000
look actually cool so great I love it so

83
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:18,919
much

84
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,780
doesn't look like silly with the fact I

85
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:22,550
think it best it's still kind of silly

86
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:24,770
damn this makes me realize how much a

87
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:27,320
real life sucks it sure that thank you

88
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:29,600
super a girl for nothing now the reason

89
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,520
that my attention was caught piqued by

90
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,870
whatever sense I have to say you

91
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,820
understand what I'm trying to say Oh

92
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:37,220
recently they did another promo

93
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:39,800
I guess because their viewers are so

94
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:42,620
high that they just some I need more so

95
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,150
again this is them showing what's cool

96
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,020
about the show this is to get more

97
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,210
people involved

00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:52,160

fandom wait there's an actual Supergirl

104
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:07,430
fandom even they have given up hope that

105
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:08,930
me must be really bad then I kind of

106
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:10,400
want to watch Supergirl now I'm not

107
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:12,380
gonna lie it seems to me little hope

108
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,909
island good this is where I was watching

109
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:19,490
bird that make it looks like they're

00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:21,409
fighting Bionicles what is he this is

111
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:23,240
not the clip though the clip because

112
00:05:21,409 --> 00:05:26,800
clearly the rightest is just giving up -

113
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,800
they're just posting at this point

114
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:36,770
[Music]

115
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:39,530
that's right a character from Supergirl

116
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:42,140
just yelled Leroy Jenkins unerotic Lee

117
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:44,630
in 2020 it might be time to cancel the

118
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:46,700
show guys I'm sorry I mean I appreciate

119
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:48,530
it I'm not gonna alight that makes me

120
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:50,660
laugh the fact that they did that but

121
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:52,610
it's also very cringe you can't do that

122
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:54,940
you can't just do that so apparently

123
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:59,030
people are actually watching the show

124
00:05:54,940 --> 00:06:02,630
why why why it's like you can do

125
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:05,200
anything anything else yeah why are you

126
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:07,730
watching this you could shoot anything I

127
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:10,010
was trying to understand why people

128
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:10,610
don't like sight as Supergirl cyber girl

129
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,830
whatever

130
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:16,640
apparently Supergirl husbands like

131
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:20,630
sneaking in social justice propaganda

132
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:22,730
what and fans aren't happy about it so I

133
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:24,950
obviously I need to investigate what is

134
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:29,810
it what I why our fans upset about this

135
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:32,990
we have this clip here you believe it a

136
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:38,470
female hero lass for my daughter to have

137
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:41,300
someone like that to look up to yeah

138
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:43,780
real nice the characters basically me

139
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:46,520
when you really want to say no that bit

140
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:50,660
but you have to go a lot that's so cool

141
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:53,270
here yeah real nice on my planet see

142
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:55,850
most bow before males this is not your

143
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:58,610
planet that's kind of anti-immigration

144
00:06:55,850 --> 00:07:00,230
message really why so it's not just cuz

145
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:01,910
he's alien he's not allowed to be on the

146
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:05,000
planet that's not cool man

147
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:08,720
she's not strong enough why I guess

148
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,660
she's just a girl no because she will

149
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,590
actually die why why so you're saying

150
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:16,010
it's because she's a woman

151
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:18,350
is that why for a cool powerful kick-ass

152
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:19,970
woman instead of a bunch of angry old

153
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:23,570
white men hey that's me

154
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:25,580
shoutout to me in the show awesome

155
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:26,900
I'm sorry I have difficulty making

156
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:32,330
conversation with men under six feet

157
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:34,310
tall we woman strong man short this is

158
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,850
all women have to have short or tiny

159
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:37,100
penis

160
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:43,070
that's all they have on us nothing else

161
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:44,300
I hope that but making me dead do you

162
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:51,260
think that's how the writers went when

163
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:53,420
they wrote that also small penis nobody

164
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:55,310
is calling me the most powerful woman in

165
00:07:53,420 --> 00:08:04,160
National City I believe they are calling

166
00:07:55,310 --> 00:08:06,050
me the most powerful person I know this

167
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,820
is a minor detail but clearly like her

168
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:09,800
suit is making her look more buff right

169
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:12,530
it could be kind of cold to get like an

170
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,450
actual really strong woman like that

171
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:16,040
Korean chick from that video that I

172
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:17,870

00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,820
actual Superman the guy to play Superman

174
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:22,670
is actually really involved like I'm not

175
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:24,830
against the idea of a super female oh

00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:27,830
god this is so hard to say I'm not

177
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:29,780
against a soprano Fullman that empowers

178
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:31,130
women I'm not against it I know that's

179
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,840
gonna sound like a lie but I'm not

180
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:34,280
against it we could really use your help

181
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:39,320
here it has to be you

182
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:45,080
