00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,360
lab right away by myself i

25
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,119
did telescope and i started the dropper

26
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,040
and then i went to specimen to do the

27
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,799
sorting and at any point if someone was

28
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,159
on the right side they could deny that

29
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,759
but no one was ever on the right side it

30
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,840
was just by myself

31
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,840

149
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,800
the first round in the second round

150
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,160

151
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,319
entire time

152
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,199

00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,800
got wait no

154
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,900
lily you did not do the lines i was at

155
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,960
the lights oh

156
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,960
[Music]

157
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,560
but she she absolutely was the one that

158
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,039
got the corpse kill

159
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,600
what yeah she killed corpse in the top

160
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:34,319
right ken just must have missed it

161
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,479
oh i didn't do it that was good enough

162
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,919
for me

163
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,840
i would normally go with you but you've

164
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,080
also accused literally every round

165
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,520
and we got nothing out of it you voted

166
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,600
everywhere convinced me

167
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,880
so i hogged those cams in the second

168
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,759
round i think this is the hardest

169
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,280
evidence

170
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:53,599
corpse ken and lily all went top right

171
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,479
corpse never came out he died in there

172
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,680
yeah that was his tool

173
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:59,840
wait where absolutely on top right

174
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,440
where ken and lily were seen exiting the

175
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,000
scene of the crime kin is dead which

176
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,039
means it wasn't

177
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,319
kitten so that means so it's your lily

178
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:09,039
then

179
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:11,199
makes sense lily defense well i mean

180
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,759
like if three of you voted it's like i'm

181
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,360
out right

182
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,520
i voted every round i thought it was

183
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,919
till's last round okay

184
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,919
i know who it is

185
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:28,000
no i'm sorry i'm sorry i thought

186
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:29,280
we skipped then michael it's actually

187
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,440
not me though

188
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:35,600
it's not me oh my god i've won

196
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:04,560
she would not lie or would break the

197
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:13,840
trust of our union as a couple

198
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:13,840
