subscribe for more cooking videos

46
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,960
why am i so cold first we peel the

47
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,040
potatoes

48
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,640
okay we should probably boil the water

49
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,000
i'll do that now just in case you're

50
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,240
following the recipe you

51
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,560
uh you boil the water if you don't know

52
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,520
how to boil water i got bad news for you

53
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,439
neither do i help me i remember in a

54
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,159
cooking class in sweden for some reason

55
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,479
our

56
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,879
cooking teacher was very weird about the

57
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,319
right amount of water for the potatoes

58
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,319
because if you use too much you lose

59
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,760
some of the nutrition but obviously

60
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,599
and you're not supposed to put the

61
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,319
potatoes i'm sure someone's gonna say

62
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,319
i'm wrong

63
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,160
but i don't care all right in case my

64
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,800
home school teacher is watching you're

65
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,360
supposed to

66
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,239
put the potatoes after the potato boils

67
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,800
okay

68
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,520
yeah but then if you can't use too much

69
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,959
water

70
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,480
and the water evaporates you don't know

71
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,160
how much water you're supposed to get

72
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,800
and i remember when we did the test me

73
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,480
and my friend

74
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,920
the moment we realized that we nailed

75
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,239
the amount of water we were like

76
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,599
yeah yeah we got the right amount of

77
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:48,239
water for the potatoes

78
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:50,480
like that matters at all for the cooking

79
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,760
that's a fun story from childhood yes

80
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,760
don't forget to salt the water

81
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,599
i don't know how much to put while the

82
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,319
water

83
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:03,280
boil up we peel potato okay make sure

84
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,760
you wash your potatoes

85
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,720
like a caressing a newborn child that's

86
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,040
how you want to do it

87
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,200
and then this is crazy you peel the

88
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,599
potato

89
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,680

90
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,120
underneath is such a good life hack

91
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,720
usually in sweden we just peel the

92
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,159

93
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,319

your face

210
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,720

we don't have a spatula ah my uh

248
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,920
my boss didn't want to waste because he

249
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,399
wanted us to pre-cook

250
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,360
all the food but he didn't want to waste

251
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,480
it in case like

252
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,760
not everything goes during the day so he

253
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,800
would tell me

254
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,600
to microwave the hot dog i think i said

255
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,920

boil hotdog

258
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,320

microwave and then we would dip it in

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,200
