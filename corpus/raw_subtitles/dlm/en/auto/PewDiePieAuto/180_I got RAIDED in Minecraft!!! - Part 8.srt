from there I've been getting a lot of

12
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:33,809
tips from you guys from on the reddit

13
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:36,090
and one of them was how you change to a

14
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:38,640
Swedish banner flag so we're gonna make

15
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:40,950
that because I made a lot of epic

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,020
upgrades to the house isn't that epic

17
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,329

39
00:01:48,610 --> 00:02:04,420

41
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:10,060

46
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:41,120
plenty of space I'm so generous now

47
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:42,889
where were the ones I let out I want to

48
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,340
kill them look at that beautiful

49
00:02:42,889 --> 00:02:47,689
beautiful it's not beautiful deer again

50
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:50,540
you're good I'm speaking to you hello

51
00:02:47,689 --> 00:02:52,579
what are you doing Oh God okay I'll kill

52
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:55,069
the mom okay so there is actually a

53
00:02:52,579 --> 00:02:57,379
reason I did all that which we'll get to

54
00:02:55,069 --> 00:02:59,599
in a second I just need to organize my

55
00:02:57,379 --> 00:03:02,750
inventory oh wow this is look good Felix

56
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,769
and I also built a fence so Sven can't

57
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:06,439
die from the lava

58
00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:09,620
don't worry gamer if Sven dies this

59
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:13,069
playthrough is over okay so the reason

60
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:15,889
why we need it's because apparently this

61
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:18,200
is redstone which activates stuff so if

62
00:03:15,889 --> 00:03:20,870
I happen to put down a dynamite it would

63
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:23,030
activate the dynamite and therefore my

64
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:24,709
house would blow up which is not good in

65
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:27,199
Minecraft generally you want to avoid

66
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:29,090
blowing up your house that's the pro tip

67
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:32,780
from a veteran gamer you guys are

68
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:35,329
welcome if we cut the sheep we can make

69
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:37,220
wool which we can make I'm like doing

70
00:03:35,329 --> 00:03:40,040
the Swedish accent on ironically at this

71
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:42,229
point chop chip chip chip chip chip chip

72
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:45,229
chip chip chip chip chip chip chip chip

73
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:46,220
chicken come on we would all ship ship

74
00:03:45,229 --> 00:03:49,520
ship ship

75
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:54,860
I don't care what Peter says I don't

76
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:58,760
care you will ship your Winship don't

77
00:03:54,860 --> 00:04:02,360
God delight now God the leg oh god the

78
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:03,790
leg this is what you create Nikita if I

79
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:08,740
can't kill them

80
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:13,090
overpopulation will happen don't escape

81
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:15,980
no one escapes if anyone else tries it

82
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:20,049
that's what I thought okay gamers now we

83
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:22,550
have wooden what the Frick are you doing

84
00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:24,170
that's what you get and that same thing

85
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:25,970
will happen to you one day if you ever

86
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:28,120
make it out of there wish you won't by

87
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:32,090
the way your doom there for eternity

88
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:37,160

to die so we need yeah we need blue and

93
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:52,370

00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,459
enjoy picking flowers

192
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:39,360

this is what minecraft is all about

261
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:13,050
color coordinating something only gamers

262
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,540
will understand

263
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:17,400
[Music]

00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:19,470
