[Applause]

111
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,560
come on explain yourselves a little bit

112
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,160
better we got time literally i saw him

113
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,919
kill corpse and then he went into the

114
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,000
vent thinking i wouldn't see him

115
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,960
where did this happen yeah the cockpit

116
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,600
cockpit carpet

117
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,199
pewdie if ken tried to jump in an event

118
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,160
and get away then why did ken report the

119
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,520
body

120
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,960
you could do that as a tactic you can

121
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,800
definitely do that if he already jumped

122
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,039
in the vent and ran away oh yeah

123
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,199
because he's trying to get me now yeah

124
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:09,440
he doesn't yeah it doesn't make sense

125
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,800
why didn't judy report the body then

126
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,520
because i didn't have time to click on

127
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,199
it

128
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,039
so we jumped in the vent and jumped out

129
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:18,400
and then reported the body

130
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,400
listen i don't make the rules

131
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,840

132
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,840

156
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:41,039
don't know what i'm doing

157
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,039
i honestly have no idea

158
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:48,639
i don't have the game i don't believe

159
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,160

160
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,520

165
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,840
in the

166
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,039
most southern room i just walked past

167
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,240
two people and i was like oh wait it

168
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,199
couldn't be them because those were two

169
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,400
people but then i realized they could

170
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,960
both be killers and i forgot who they

171
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,199
were

172
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,880
no you didn't notice who it was i can't

173
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:14,080
believe he saw us

174
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:17,840
and he [ __ ] forgot who he saw that's

175
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,840

184
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,280

185
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,000

it's right in front of me

191
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,080
so you you were by the body and you

350
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,360
pj going around where the body was

351
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,880
because i saw it just at the end they've

352
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,040
literally walked over it

353
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,560

00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,320
what if he's just dudes and he's running

357
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,920
around murdering people and

358
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,600
self-reporting it immediately

359
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:33,400
i only i didn't report that no no

360
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:39,059
very possible let's kill lizzy

361
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:39,059
[Music]

362
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,839
the laser

363
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,399
i was thinking that that's funny he

364
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,600
looks his move is throw whoever the

365
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,279
other imposters under the bus

366
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,720
all right take a note no assistance dave

367
00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:00,480
gets overly aggressive and

368
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:02,560
starts accusing everyone that's his tail

369
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,680
dave's always getting blamed i don't

370
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,519
think petey is ready he's

371
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,720
trying to end he's trying to enter the

372
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:11,279

all right dylan's locked from me what's

397
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,600
happened

398
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,040
i found a body in the most southern room

399
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,920
i just came from the left

400
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,240
with roomies so it's not roomy the door

401
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,839
was

402
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,639
i'm near roomie and i didn't see you

403
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,639
anywhere of course

404
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,519
nothing i'm falling behind him and i

405
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,720
didn't see him corpse was there right

406
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,079
before you came dave

407
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,279
i can't tell who's talking but the door

408
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,000
was locked from the right so it's none

409
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,880
of us on the

410
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,839
on the left who's also on i was on the

411
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,160
right doing white

412
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,079
security at the moment i'm still a

413
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,399
little suspicious of corpse and joel

414
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:34,000
because i didn't see corpse there but i

415
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,880
didn't see well that kind of makes me

416
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,920
suspicious of

417
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:40,959
you the bad guess you you i just

418
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:43,440
yeah dave okay well that leaves jaden

419
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:45,199
felix pj right i don't know whatever

420
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,240
yeah i saw jaden run into nab

421
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:51,199
on the camera so felix or pj

422
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,079
pj was alone in med bay with dave and i

423
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,519
could have killed me

424
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,519
and dave was alive in there so that

425
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,480
makes me think it's not pj no no yeah i

426
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,000
was doing medicine

427
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:04,559
okay that's good for now because i think

428
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:06,319
it could be roommates oh

429
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,839
it was locked i couldn't physically get

430
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,839
in to kill the body it's like not

431
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:13,039
possible wait who would have me

432
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:17,120
i did you [ __ ] [ __ ] uh-oh dave

433
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:21,039
okay so dave seems really weird now

434
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:23,919
uh i'll i'll use pd as my alibi now

435
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:26,160
then we'll kill whoever i saw here oh

436
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,160
okay

437
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,160
uh i guess it's not dave south southern

438
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,679
part

439
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,360
i'm pulling into this thought pattern

440
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,200
that pj and lizzie were really like

441
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,039
aggressive on in the first round i think

442
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,919
especially pj was uncharacteristically

443
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,520
just on the ball

444
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,720
but that's not i'm just no i'm just

445
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,000
getting yeah i wasn't aggressive i

446
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,120
haven't voted for anyone yet i've

447
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,559
skipped every round

448
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,919
the way you guys are talking like right

449
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,720
now everyone else is kind of chill and

450
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,559
you guys are

451
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,320
i feel like i'm always aggressive i'm

452
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,600
always you know about me

453
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,679
i'm pretty sure it's roomy by the way

454
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,799
guys okay now i'm really suspicious of

455
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,559
you lizzie wow

456
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,559

00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:03,440
anything to listen what were you doing

458
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:05,039

461
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,559
pj was doing a test up there i was stuck

473
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,760

490
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:22,080
bottom left of the map

491
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,760
yeah i could have vouched for ken

492
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,000
because he did the task at the bottom as

493
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,039
well

494
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,480
he let the thing out i saw jaden had a

495
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:30,720
chance to kill me and did i

496
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,640
i think lizzy's safe but i'm not sure

497
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,679
pewter's following me the entire time

498
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,559

499
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,250
he didn't kill me

500
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:40,080
