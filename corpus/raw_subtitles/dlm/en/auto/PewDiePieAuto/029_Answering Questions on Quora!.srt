floor gang ow my brain 20% increase I'm

7
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,640

the world there's a Twitter account that

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,050

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,719
from from Chora so I thought why don't I

11
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:36,270
chime in and give my best advice for

12
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:39,750
these poor souls with tiny stinky brains

13
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:42,960
here we have for example I don't like my

14
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:45,239
daughter she is disrespectful and very

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,219
negative she clearly does not like me

16
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:49,680
how can I get her to be more positive

17
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:52,260
and realize I'm not the enemy

18
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,230
throw her in the trash and get a new one

19
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,510
I don't like my daughter she says

20
00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:00,870
brazzers would have an answer for this

21
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:03,660

22
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:06,270

00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:10,890
doesn't sleep for days on end she says

25
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,670
she likes it when she starts seeing

26
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:16,830
things what should I do

27
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:19,020

28
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,450
seeing things asking for a friend

29
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,400

experiment on different things they're

32
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,700
basically like tiny versions of you that

33
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,979

34
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,689

42
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,500
you is it appropriate for a parent to

43
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:57,450
throw their 18 year-old daughter out of

44
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,700
their house because she is no longer in

45
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:02,340
school refuses to help around the house

46
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,140
our yard and it's very disrespectful

47
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,329

48
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,310
throw them out you can always just make

49
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:09,959
a new one make sure you tell that to

50
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,160

what fruit starts with the letter O I

55
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:26,230
can't think of any that's impossible

56
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:29,350
oh oh banana Oh Apple Apple is that you

00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:31,510
saying people reply orange added a photo

58
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:34,570
orange is why they'd known and accepted

59
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:35,770
fruit all over the world so widely

60
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:38,530
accepted fruit

61
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:42,640
I don't accept the orange I don't and

62
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:46,630
I'm tired of being okay with it it is a

63
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:49,000
member of the Big B that's what you are

64
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:50,980
who Spencer day doing this I mean I'm

65
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,500
technically doing it but goddamn the

66
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:55,240
cringe what are some street-smart tips

67
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,520
that could potentially help me one day

68
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:00,190
always carry a few coins in your pocket

69
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:02,170
no that's super annoying they cling all

70
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:04,330
in your pocket and they always fall out

71
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:06,100
in your sofa this is terrible advice

72
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:08,350
if someone confronts you with a knife

73
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:10,450
you pull the coins ugly from your pocket

74
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:15,490
and drop them on the floor the attacker

75
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:19,270
will always look down oh oh oh

76
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:22,090
poins there's coins bro Jerry Jerry

00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:27,820
but there's coins I thought like there

79
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:29,320
was some defense mechanism like you

80
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:32,040
throw the coins in their eye or some

81
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:34,390

84
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:41,140
happens when you stop eating sugar you

85
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:43,930
die you die instantly

86
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:46,870

88
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:50,440
you learn too late in life books are

89
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,730
probably the best friend in life books

90
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,950
can help you gain tremendous knowledge

91
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:56,050
and help you when no one else when no

92
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:58,000
one can and I can't read now I agree

93
00:03:56,050 --> 00:04:01,330
with this except that you have garbage

94
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,230
in what it stays the subtle art of not

95
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:06,280
giving up

96
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:12,640
ah it's everywhere read the Greeks read

97
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:15,280
the Greeks notice of a butcher about the

98
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,440
space this space will be about deep

99
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,150
thoughts that occur in your brain and

100
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:23,060
heart hence the name deep thoughts

101
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:24,590
my mind is ready to go blow this space

102
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,419
will be mainly poached for a thought

103
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:28,820
remain a few answers that have deep

104
00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:30,710
thoughts literally no one has posted

105
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:32,690
anything thoughtful I'm trying to think

106
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:35,810
what I think is interesting about space

107
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:38,479
and deep thoughts I want to contribute I

108
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:40,090
think the fact that the Pythagorean Oh

109
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,979
what's called in English Pythagoras and

110
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:45,199
it's called the Pythagorean theorem that

111
00:04:42,979 --> 00:04:48,500
eight squared plus B squared equals C

112
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,930
square it's an another example that math

113
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:53,270
is universal because it transcends time

114
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:56,330
and space no matter what time and no

115
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:58,669
matter what space a square plus B Square

116
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:59,840
will always be C square it's a universal

117
00:04:58,669 --> 00:05:02,330
truth which i think is really

118
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,940
interesting you can draw on a whiteboard

119
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:07,729
the triangle obviously that will not

120
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:09,320
stay but the the theorem itself will

121
00:05:07,729 --> 00:05:12,830
always remain the same I think it's cool

122
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:15,199
pp large is it okay to eat a lot for

123
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:16,460
breakfast for weight gain yeah you can

124
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,010

pay attention to one's eating habit

152

calories to be as obese as yes I know I

164
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:24,470
know historically during famines it's

165
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:25,820
seen as more attractive to be more of a

166
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:28,610
weight as a status symbol

167
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:30,500

233
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:35,560
xbox game 20 years ago it was great

234
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:38,440
if the earth-moon was replaced by an

235
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:40,300

241
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:53,260
were as deep as we depict them in a lot

242
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,329
of artwork then our blood vessels would

243
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:58,029
explode so I'm pretty sure we would all

244
00:10:55,329 --> 00:11:00,610

00:10:58,029 --> 00:11:02,740

as well pretty pattern lines they give a

317
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:14,500
sense of superior muscle increase around

318
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:17,080
10 to 20 percent why it's pity pie in

319
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:19,060
the center of so many controversies

320
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:21,250
because I've always had a very

321
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:24,010
light-hearted take on serious topics

322
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:26,110
which was clearly someone that is as

323
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:26,590
popular as I am should have seen that

324
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:28,420
coming

325
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:30,580
it was inevitable does that make it

326
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:32,830
right probably not but that doesn't make

327
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:35,320
me completely blameless either I've been

328
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:38,860
very reckless and not careful and I've

329
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:42,550
paid the price for it but now no more

330
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:44,080
controversy only epic that's a British

331
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,710
costume by the way just so we're clear

332
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,410
okay

333
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:49,450
what a pretty face political views you

334
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:51,460
just do it in Swedish interviews if you

335
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:53,640
ask me it's not interested in engaging

336
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:55,230
in politics look through his mother's

337
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,910
Facebook don't snoop through my mom

338
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:59,100
there's nothing political there either

339
00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:00,900
they really broke this down even most

340
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,490
Swedish right-wingers dislike Trump

341
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,590
Trump's approval rating screaming what

342
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:06,300
the hell reason I don't get into

343
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:09,960
politics is because I find that it's

344
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:12,450
more based on all your evil oh no you're

345
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:14,340
evil Oh your Center will pick a side

346
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:16,110
it's just it's just become more about

347
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:18,510
name-calling instead of discussing

348
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:21,090
actual ideas of how to improve the

349
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:23,700
quality of life okay I'll let pity pie

350
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:25,200

00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:15,030
no Jorge Luis boys add fictions on lists

367
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,600
man's search for meaning book of five

368
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:19,470
rings

369
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:21,300
the symposium Sun and steel would add

370
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:23,400
more can't be ours you're welcome what

371
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:25,350
are some great historical nominal day

372
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:27,270
Iliad it's hundred percent true how many

373
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:28,680
books can you read a day I usually read

374
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:30,270
three books at the same time while

375
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,190
listening to five different audio books

376
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:35,370
on different speeds but that's just what

377
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:37,830
I do which book of Hara haruki murakami

378
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:38,310
was the first one you read who [ __ ]

379
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:42,390
cares

380
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:43,980
IQ 84 1q84 and it's not that's a

381
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:45,240
terrible one to start with the region

382
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:48,900
Wood is a good one to start with I

383
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:50,670
always recommend Murakami if you're a

384
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:52,650
new reader because this is literature

385
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:54,990
it's quite easy it's easy to get into

386
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:57,900
and it has a lot of sex a lot of

387
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:59,370
underage sex in every single book every

388
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:01,200
time I read it Murakami become like

389
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:05,190
great this one doesn't have underage sex

390
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:07,360
in then oh god dammit god dammit like

391
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:09,370
Wow actually got more respect

392
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,290
for Murakami's writing he managed to

393
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:15,280
write a thoughtful novel without some

394
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:17,650
weird outward scene in it academy he

395
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:20,079
managed somehow why is the counter

396
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:21,819
Montecristi are so compelling it teaches

397
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,500
you that achieving happiness can come

398
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:25,420
from pain whatever pain you're going

399
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:28,510
through in life know that it will one

400
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:30,280
day bring you virtue it's a great book I

401
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:31,780
recommend it what does it mean for

402
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,640
someone to say you are like donkey shot

403
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:35,970
is it a compliment no they're calling

404
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,970
you stupid

405
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:40,570
so fun judging people online I love this

406
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,150
I wonder what to say by yukio mishima

407
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:44,950
this question presupposes that death has

408
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:47,200
value and if not done properly is

409
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:51,150
meaningless when in reality his death

410
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:53,710
was in fact executed deliberately and

411
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:55,299
we're too clean to give it just that

412
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:58,419
meaning boom

413
00:17:55,299 --> 00:18:00,490
helping the world understand no one says

414
00:17:58,419 --> 00:18:02,830
the pictures speak louder than words

415
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:06,190
buying a vehicle starting a family

416
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:09,490
homeownership Wow

417
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:13,770
deep does this picture say more than a

418
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:16,570
thousand words add one word to it deep

419
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:20,080
now I think it says one word I think

420
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:24,850
that what this picture says is it's too

421
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:26,530
many words I don't know I'm obviously

422
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:30,220
joking and coming across as very

423
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:31,960
know-it-all and deliberately playing it

424
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:34,570
up for the video just sorry it's clear

425
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:36,100
I'm not I'm just [ __ ] around I just

426
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:38,380
don't really see a point in any of these

427
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:40,630
I always felt like you can people can

428
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:42,190
tell you the answer to things but to

429
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:43,960
understand it is something that you

430
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:45,549
really have to discover for yourself so

431
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:47,410
I just find this whole page to be so

432
00:18:45,549 --> 00:18:49,690
redundant unless there's some actual

433
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:52,480
factual questions and I always looked at

434
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:55,450
random information like did you know

435
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,070
that's this kind of obnoxious but that's

436
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:58,929

437
00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:00,910
