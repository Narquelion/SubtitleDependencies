on the planet

196
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,840

a film based on this movie

198
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,280

199
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,199
just saying this

200
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,479
not just for slipping through side

201
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,199
editing it but

202
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,400
also slipping through me and doing a

203
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,479
second edit on it

204
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,840
and then also slipping through me four

205
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,160
times watching it
