in drugs or video games or

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,600

that gaming is too fun uh

90
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,840
just seeing a bit of correlating message

91
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,760
here joe

92
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,360
[ __ ] video games three years later

93
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,120
you could be that same kid

94
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,519
just playing video games waiting for the

95
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,319
next vic's whatever the [ __ ] game is

96
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,319
you know next xbox game to come out and

97
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,799
you're going to waste your time

98
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,319
you have children you got to waste your

99
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:56,000
time playing video games

100
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:57,280
jiu jitsu not a waste of time i mean i i

101
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,560
get what he's saying though at least

102
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,680
with jiu jitsu you

103
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,680
you're building your body you're

104
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,120
building your muscles you're learning a

105
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,400
skill that you're going to have for life

106
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,239
instead of a video game

107
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,159
that comes out you know there's always a

108
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,360
new cycle of games even if you get good

109
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,959
at one

110
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,439
there's always going to be a new one i

111
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,959
guess is my point uh so i get it i get

112
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,880
his point it's just like the worst

113
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,320
example ever with jiu jitsu

114
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,400
and that's another thing like you

115
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,880
wouldn't even have to be good

116
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,240
at gaming to make a living obviously

117
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,320
right

118
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,280
there's compared gaming competitive as a

119
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,759
as a

120
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,639
superior job it's like the worst example

121
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,199
you can make

122
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,320
you can make analytical content reviews

123
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,440
streaming

124
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,600
youtube esports managing i like all

125
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,520
these so much aspects of gaming

126
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,520
and it's such a massive market

127
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,560
developing whatever you understand what

128
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,639
i'm saying

129
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,560
uh i'm curious what ninja said let's

130
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,759
check out what ninja said and i guess

131
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,240
that's the thing like

132
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,360
who gives joe rogan has to say about

133
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,520
video games like

134
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,479
no one cares that's like what i would

135
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,240
think about

136
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,840
i know i know everything about

137
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,800
everything so it's hard to think of an

138
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,800
example

139
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,440
makeup that's like me saying make up

140
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,680
stupid you cannot make money make a

141
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,520
doesn't happen but i think it's the fact

142
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,520
that everyone is talking about this

143
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,520
that makes it so interesting and it hits

144
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,000
comment about wasting time it's almost

145
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,919
like

146
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,520
joe rogan accidentally brought up the

147
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,560
discussion of what is the meaning of

148
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,400
life

149
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,639
building a career for yourself or you're

150
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,240
making money and

151
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,320
building something out of yourself or

152
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,199
just having fun in the moment and

153
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,199
enjoying yourself and

154
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,479
that's almost how it became such a big

155
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,600
deal uh let's see what

156
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:42,160
mr ninja said most recent

157
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,600
uh clip going on about joe rogan his

158
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,840
comment about video games

159
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,960
or like gamers and i think where he was

160
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,440
coming from

161
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,720
um or what he was talking about

162
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,240
specifically i don't want to put words

163
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,680
in his mouth but i watch the whole thing

164
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,960
and try to get context of it and watch

165
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,039
you know

166
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,000
i don't want to say it just say you hate

167
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,479
him ninja

168
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,400
just say gate uh i will put merch in his

169
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,000
mouth because uh

170
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,319
i want to be invited to his podcast in

171
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,759
the future but i think maybe like what

172
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,120
he meant was like that uh

173
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,199
i think i watched the whole clip and

174
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,000
like uh i don't think he meant anything

175
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,840
bad

176
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,680
to the podcast joe rogan let's talk

177
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,240
about games

178
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,039
i love you babe before and after the

179
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,280
clip that was just

180
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,639
you know being posted on twitter it

181
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,639
sounds like he's talking about like the

182
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,400
top one percent like the very odd

183
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,240
or one-off chance that you're gonna be a

184
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,520
professional player any sports player

185
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,960
and a successful one at that

186
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,039
right i mean you can be a professional

187
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,000
esports player and you know beyond like

188
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,440
a tier two tier three

189

190
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,240
most and obviously if you're not winning

191
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,120
and being paid a lot you're and you're

192
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,560

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,400
awareness to mental health and bipolar

219
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,759

close-minded it's creatures

222
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,479

223
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,680
a kid to such a degree that i wanted to

224
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,599
know how to make them

225
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,599
i wasted time learning some coding art

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,360
sound and music and now been wasting my

227
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,960
life for nearly 30 years writing music

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,720
for them and companies waste lots of

229
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:50,400
money paying me for it

249
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:28,240
even know what that means

250
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,440
this is such a generational gap that's

251
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,840
always existed

252
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,479
even with novels i'm sure people said

253
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,880
like oh

254
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,560
people wasting their time reading books

255
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,640
huh you should be go out there in the

256
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,440
real world enjoy the real world

257
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,360
cringe it's just a thing that's always

258
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,320
been going on and it's always going to

259
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,080
keep happening

260
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,399
but i also find yeah i do find it kind

261
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,360
of cringe with all the streamers

262
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:53,440
being going after joe being like well i

263
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,600
make a living he's so stupid

264
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,519
it feels kind of irresponsible almost to

265
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,279
just say say that because it's

266
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,720
i love the idea that i can just inspire

267
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,480
my audience or

268
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,240
i don't know people in general if they

269
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,720
want to pursue youtube and other

270
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,000
gaming related things like yeah go for

271
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,760
it but i don't want to

272
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
sell people on the pipe dream that is

273
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:15,760
possible for everyone because it isn't

274
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,839
just like any sport or uh profession

275
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,600
you have to be in that one top percent

276
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,360
or 0.1 or whatever

277
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,279
the percentage may be to really be

278
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,399
successful at it and it just doesn't

279
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,080
happen to everyone

280
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,839
and that's just that's just reality of

281
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,360
life does that mean you shouldn't pursue

282
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,000
your dreams no but

283
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,360
i think it's important to have some

284
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,279
perspective of your

285
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,640
what you're pursuing at least and i

286
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,600
think especially when you're talking

287
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,480
about something that

288
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,680
is actually like what joe was saying

289
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,000
highly addictive

290
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,160
like the video games are dopamine hits

291
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,040
and having kids being so

292
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,680
exposed to them for hours and hours i

293
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,279
can't

294
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,600
honestly say that i think that's

295
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,360
necessarily a good thing either i it

296
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,800
kind of worries me as well a little bit

297
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,600
when we designed something to be

298
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,560
addicted and

299
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,160
even myself as a kid i was probably i

300
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,760
yeah looking back i was definitely

301
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,880
actually addicted to video games

302
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,640
and i think a lot of kids are

303
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,640
i think it's way more common that people

304
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,560
think so even though there's a ton of

305
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,120
benefits to video games like i read

306
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,800
studies saying that it helps with

307
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,800
logical thinking

308
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,560
like puzzle solving i guess that's

309
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,920
logical thinking reaction time if you

310
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,079
think that's important

311
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,760
yeah it can improve your memory you can

312
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,680
meet friends online

313
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,120
it can help you get out of mental health

314
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,519
situations there's a ton of

315
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,240
positive benefits but i think that

316
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,440
doesn't

317
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,959
make gaming above criticism it seems

318
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,720
like the gaming community is so

319
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,640
sensitive to criticism like

320
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,240
just acknowledging that gaming addiction

321
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,839
is a thing and that it is a problem

322
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,880
which i think is what joe is trying to

323
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,120
get at he's just

324
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,240
he just brought up a terrible example at

325
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,240
least i think

326
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,680
uh yeah invite me to your podcast joe i

327
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,519
love you come on

328
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,040
this is what it really meant guys it

329
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,800
doesn't diminish all the good

330
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,800
you can talk about both it's okay

331
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,920
uh you know if gaming is your only hobby

332
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,240
i would invite you to

333
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,839
try something else it's fun that's the

334
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,200
fun thing about life it's like what we

335
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,399
talked about in the beginning

336
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,560
is life about pursuing uh trying to

337
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,640
build something big for yourself or just

338
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,880
enjoying yourself and i think personally

339
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,000
the answer is just a balance of both to

340
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,240
me the idea of

341
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,680
going through life being perfect just

342
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,440
feeling comfortable

343
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,360
and feeling happy in the moment being

344
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,440
entertained is terrifying

345
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,720
i hate that idea i never want to live

346
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,600
life just like that

347
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,320
but also uh living life when i look at

348
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,000
people that are

349
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,839
all about optimizing and trying to be as

350
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,760
effective as possible and

351
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,320
and accomplish as much as possible that

352
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,000
makes me really disgusted as well i i

353
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,079
think there's just a middle ground

354
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,920
i feel like i i am though becoming more

355
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,720
boomer across the years like

356
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,450
i a a few years ago as you guys know i

357
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,800
got into reading a lot more and

358
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:57,040
[Laughter]

359
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,880
i god i'm such such a boomer this is

360
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,160
like comparing that hobby

361
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,480
which is something you kind of have to

362
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,320
force yourself a little bit to get into

363
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,000
if you're not used to it to something

364
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,519
compared to video games

365
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,959
i mean obviously it's different for

366
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,800
everyone and everyone gets different

367
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:13,040
things out of different hobbies but i

368
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,720
i can't honestly say i get that much out

369
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,560
of video games

370
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,160
compared to reading a book that i feel

371
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,600
like oh i learned something i actually

372
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,800
got something out of this even if it's

373
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,120
fiction i can still oh

374
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,880
cool i could immerse myself in in a

375
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,560
character i guess you can do that in

376
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,279
games but i don't think games are that

377
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,120
good at it

378
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,480
i don't think they are i can't remember

379
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,440
last time i played a game and be like oh

380
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,760
i learned something

381
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,920
maybe i'm wrong maybe there are examples

382
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,600
but it just doesn't happen as often

383
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,519
as what i'm saying i guess what i'm

384
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,519
saying is find a balance by all means

385
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,560

couldn't be happier about it but also

390
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,720
find a balance

391
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,680

392
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,360
