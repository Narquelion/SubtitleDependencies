million in 2015 according to the mana

126
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,759

127
00:06:01,669 --> 00:06:07,220

128
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:09,110
million the very old data isn't it gets

129
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:12,139
also made nearly 42 million in

130
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:15,050
merchandise what no way

131
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:17,479
I wish Jesus Christ by the March guys

132
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:19,580
I'm not made anywhere near that amount

133
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:23,360
three thousand four hundred dollars per

134
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:25,100
hour not bad for a university drop by I

135
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,470
don't know exactly how much I make per

136
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,820
day it doesn't seem too far off which is

137
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:32,300
pretty crazy when you think about it

138
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:33,550
money is such a I go right in the deep

139
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:37,160
end but money is such an interesting

140
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:39,500
topic for me because I obviously didn't

141
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,330
start YouTube to make money a sad thing

142
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:44,630
I've learned is how much people value

143
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:47,180
money in a way or at least the idea of

144
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:49,340
money people look at money as something

145
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:51,050
undoubtedly good it couldn't possibly be

146
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:54,530
something negative to have money which

147
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:56,449
is understandably a strange concept for

148
00:06:54,530 --> 00:07:00,020
people to accept but you look at people

149
00:06:56,449 --> 00:07:03,169
that win the lottery and having money

150
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:05,570
then fundamentally changes their their

151
00:07:03,169 --> 00:07:07,940
whole life you know not just how they

152
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:10,780
view life but also how other people view

153
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:14,180
them and I think that's a change in

154
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:15,590
particular that I feel like I really

155
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:19,820
want to protect and that's the reason

156
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:22,310
why in a in a way I try to live modestly

157
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:25,039
because obviously I don't but in

158
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:27,229
considering how much I make I try to

159
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,760
delay modesty because I don't want to I

160
00:07:27,229 --> 00:07:32,419
want to just live a normal life I don't

161
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:35,060
want it the money to change my life it's

162
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:36,560
great to have but if it it can also

163
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:38,810
obviously become a problem

164
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,180
millionaire ranks about why money's bad

165
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:42,860
okay I think it's important to note

166
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:46,430
those I know I think a lot of people

167
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:48,169
think oh if I only had money then it

168
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:50,150
would solve all this problem for me when

169
00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:52,880
it's not really true and also the

170
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:54,710
concept of when is it ever enough unless

171
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,570
you have a goal of how much you want to

172
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:59,510
make if you've invested in the stock

173
00:07:56,570 --> 00:08:01,909
market then having money is obviously a

174
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:03,469
stressful element as well because once

175
00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:05,090
you have money you're afraid of losing

176
00:08:03,469 --> 00:08:05,490
money there's a lot of things to

177
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:07,800
consider

178
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:09,389
that I think isn't brought up enough and

179
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,300
I think a lot of people look at money in

180
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:15,240
a way that oh they only had money all my

181
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:17,940
problems will be solved which I can say

182
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,830
it's not true okay everyone is a blood

183
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:21,419
sucking vampire and they want your money

184
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:23,759
and as soon as they know you have money

185
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:26,190
they aren't coming for it okay that's my

186
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:30,240
little rant of the day here my goal is

187
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:33,690
to save up a little bit so I can buy a

188
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:36,180
house in Japan and have enough to be

189
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:38,520
able to sustain myself for the future

190
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:41,969
I'm gonna live a long life and I want to

191
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:44,930
be able to have it for a while as well

192
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:47,430
you know that if anyone is wondering why

193
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:49,050
you know maybe why does he still do

194
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:51,480
brand deals and all this stuff that's

195
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:52,950
why I have that's my goal and I think

196
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:56,220
it's important to have a goal in mind

197
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:58,680
what is Peter Pisan Network okay this

198
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:00,570
one says 20 million okay I would say

199
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,570
it's definitely more than that

200
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:06,959
what is PewDiePie famous for for lets

201
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:09,089
playing I guess that makes sense

202
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:11,220
I don't think people now associate me

203
00:09:09,089 --> 00:09:14,700
with Let's Plays but that is what made

204
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:16,440
me become the beg you to ba it's pretty

205
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:19,260
crazy how much this channel has changed

206
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:22,920
over the years from screechie let's play

207
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:25,050
commentary too I just spit out a rice to

208
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:27,000
screechy meme commentary everyone that's

209
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:29,640
right now I'm really I'm really proud of

210
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,329
myself for making these decisions that

211
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:35,490
at the time seemed really stupid but

212
00:09:33,329 --> 00:09:37,740
obviously it paid off a really really

213
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:39,180
big time I think a lot of youtuber fell

214
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:41,970
in the trap that they always have to

215
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:44,240
please their audience no matter what and

216
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:46,589
that should be their main goal and and

217
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,950
that's the kind of youtubers that end up

218
00:09:46,589 --> 00:09:52,709
becoming sort of slaves to themselves

219
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:54,779
and their own content and eventually it

220
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:56,100
just leads to the demise of the channel

221
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:57,870
because after a while people aren't

222
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,029
gonna be interested anymore if you're a

223
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:02,700
minecraft channel and you always just do

224
00:10:00,029 --> 00:10:04,050
minecraft videos obviously you can find

225
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,180
a lot of success in that don't get me

226
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:07,890
wrong after a while people are gonna get

227
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,720
tired of it although minecraft is a

228
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:11,790
terrible example it's closed clearly

229
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,950
it's still very popular fortnight for

230
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:16,380
example you know that has a

231
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:18,180
owning people aren't gonna be always

232
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,350
looking for for tonight content I don't

233
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:22,889
know what I'm getting at the point was

234
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:25,320
for me when I did horror videos

235
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:27,899
it was getting exhausting every single

236
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:30,360
day I played horror games going ah ah

237
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:31,889
and after a while it just wasn't funny

238
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,199
it wasn't interesting and it wasn't

239
00:10:31,889 --> 00:10:36,449
scary anymore so I kept making horror

240
00:10:34,199 --> 00:10:38,490
videos even though I didn't like it and

241
00:10:36,449 --> 00:10:40,800
then people got angry at me from not

242
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:43,320
getting scared and for not enjoying it

243
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,209
which is like what I wasn't getting out

244
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,769
of it anyway so then I stopped doing it

245
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:48,240
and then people got angry why aren't you

246
00:10:46,769 --> 00:10:49,800
playing horror games anymore and I

247
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,899
realize I'm not gonna be able to please

248
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,850
end everyone so I might as well do what

249
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:55,709
I enjoy and I think that was my point

250
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:57,779
that's what really paid off who is the

251
00:10:55,709 --> 00:11:01,560
richest youtuber I'm pretty sure I am

252
00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:05,570
NOT the richest youtuber I I don't do

253
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:10,589
these sort of mega deals I don't I'm not

254
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:12,149
the big corporate yeah I would assume do

255
00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:15,000
perfect probably makes a lot more money

256
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:16,800
than me just based on the fact that they

257
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,740
do these massive deals

258
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,360
that's just pure speculation but I can

259
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,510
see that I can also see Ryan's toy

260
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,699
review making a lot more than me because

261
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:28,680
kids advertisement I don't know if they

262
00:11:26,699 --> 00:11:30,870
advertise but it wouldn't surprise me if

263
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,880
they made more than me again just pure

264
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:34,920
speculation I have no idea but at the

265
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,839
same time that's what these sites do as

266
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,040
well they don't know how much we make so

267
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:40,709
it's always kind of annoying when people

268
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:42,329
accept these as face value they're like

269
00:11:40,709 --> 00:11:45,300
oh my god he makes this much money

270
00:11:42,329 --> 00:11:47,279
that's crazy oh my god superwoman made

271
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,959
this much that's crazy that they don't

272
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,839
know they're just coming up with numbers

273
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:55,079
and a lot of times these are less

274
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:58,949
confirmed by management's that do the

275
00:11:55,079 --> 00:12:01,260
deals for these people so they conflate

276
00:11:58,949 --> 00:12:04,050
the numbers as a way to get more money

277
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:05,970
from brand deals as a way to justify

278
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:07,709
getting paid more format brand deals oh

279
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:10,260
this person makes this much from brand

280
00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:13,829
deals is PewDiePie still dating Mars yet

281
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:15,899

PewDiePie moving to Japan

getting a visa and all that stuff

300
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:21,850
apparently I spoke to a tax expert and

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,190
they said it's actually a little

302
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:26,380
complicated now because of Logan Pole

303
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:29,590
because people associate youtuber

304
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:32,740
youtuber isn't recognized as a job in

305
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:35,200
Japan or a lot of countries and then

306
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:36,640
they mentioned that thanks to Logan Paul

307
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,430
it's actually a little bit more

308
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:44,560
complicated thanks Logan thanks a lot

a short period so there's hasn't been a

321
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:19,000
moment for me to come back to Gothenburg

00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:22,210
even though it's technically my hometown

00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:10,940
here anymore so this is the building and

342
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:12,200
we would live on the top and hey man so

343
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:14,660
many funny stories but I don't know what

344
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,670
I want to share I used to always if I

345
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:19,490
was bored at night I would always throw

346
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:22,250
snowballs and people walking I was so

347
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:27,020
drunk one time when I came home that I

348
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:28,310
threw up outside the window and for sure

349
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:30,380
you know there's obviously a lot of

350
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:32,270
parking here but my parents out of all

351
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:35,120
cars that could be parked underneath my

352
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:39,620
parents car what's the one that took the

353
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:41,960
fall so my parents enter the car though

354
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:44,390
my parents are leaving this morning look

355
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:46,370
at the car then looking up see that it's

356
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:48,950
literally my window and they're like

357
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:51,410
okay well he did it that son of a [ __ ]

358
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:54,530
but they were obviouly not mad about it

359
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:56,030
I think they realized that normally they

360
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:58,420
I remember they said it they were like

361
00:15:56,030 --> 00:16:02,090
usually you're not bad so you're okay

362
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:03,500
very nice parents I have this I realize

363
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:05,150
this video just became something

364
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,980
completely different but this is what I

365
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:08,750
want to do okay let's go to where I

366
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:11,750
actually grew up though because I only

367
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:13,460
lived my teenage years in this centre

368
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:17,570
this is a road that I grew up there's a

369
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:18,980
house super cute road then my best

370
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:20,810
friend would live in this house so we

371
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:23,180
were literally neighbors oh this is not

372
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:24,950
a privacy problem yeah that's the house

373
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:27,410
I grew up in Oh they build out the

374
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:30,920
balcony super nice neighborhood I'm very

375
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:34,760
thankful for my parents for letting we

376
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:37,070
grew up in such a great place so weird

377
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:41,720
to look back at these things oh my god

378
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:44,060
they cut down the tree there was this

379
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:48,620
ginormous

380
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:50,420
apple pear tree here and my parents

381
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:52,370
would literally always make me clean up

382
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:54,350
all the pears okay I take back

383
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:57,230
everything nice I said about my parents

384
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:58,910
okay they would always make me clean up

385
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:01,670
the pears and there were so many goddamn

386
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:03,500
pears they were so big so many pears

387
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:04,490
there was apple trees over here and I

388
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:08,089
have to clean that up too

389
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:10,160
I need to cut the grass on this hail how

390
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:11,720
do you even do that and then we were

391
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,459
responsible for the snow on this

392
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,990
staircase is there anyone Falls and dies

393
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:17,839
that would be our fault so they would

394
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:19,760
always send me out to scoop the snow how

395
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:21,949
could they how could they treat me like

396
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,870
this this takes me back man all right

397
00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:24,410
enough with that let's go back to why

398
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:27,860
we're here

399
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:33,230
it's PD pie no no I'm not vegan

400
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:35,870
I guess I'm pescetarian basically I just

401
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:39,140
eat fish and no other meats so she is

402
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:41,480
too good to give up one of the reasons

403
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:43,820
why was when we shot scared pretty pie

404
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:49,400
season two I had to interact with a

405
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:53,300
bunch of pigs and they were so cute it's

406
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:55,970
like I don't want to eat these my my

407
00:17:53,300 --> 00:18:00,640
moral is that I would I eat what I would

408
00:17:55,970 --> 00:18:04,130
kill I don't like the idea of making

409
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:06,590
this uncomfortable act of killing

410
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:09,380
something so easy it's PewDiePie

411
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:12,470
American no still dating my it's P PI

412
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:15,980
Russian it's pretty PI good what a great

413
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:19,050
question no no I'm not

414
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:21,550
why is pewdiepie chairs so expensive

415
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:25,700
[Laughter]

416
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:29,570
it's a high-quality chair with Italian

417
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:36,470
leather and fashion why is pewdiepie so

418
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:39,290
hot when is PD PI birthday getting

00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:50,500
PewDiePie speak Japanese yeah yes

421
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:54,440
no I'm true very slowly very very slowly

422
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:57,480
like trying to learn 10pt pi sing with

423
00:18:54,440 --> 00:19:00,660
auto-tune yes speak Russian

424
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:02,370
no but my parents taught me a little bit

425
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:05,280
of Russian when I was growing up so I

426
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:07,850
know how to read the letters more or

427
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:10,290
less and I I mean I know a few words

428
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:13,980
mean years with Felix

429
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:16,230
yeah Roberta you a youtube when I was

430
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:18,780
young people thought Russia was gonna be

431
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:21,270
the new big country and it obviously

432
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:23,480
became China instead so they thought oh

433
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:26,070
it'd be good for him to learn Russian

434
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:28,559
thanks for nothing Russia you'd really

435
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:31,140
did it can pee deep I sue the median it

436
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:33,030
depends I get this question a lot like

437
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:34,440
why don't you just sue the media bla bla

438
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:36,990
bla bla bla I think the thing is that

439
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:40,650
you have to prove that what they wrote

440
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:43,350
they actually wrote knowing that it was

441
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:45,690
false or something like that which is

442
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:48,120
kind of hard to prove I think maybe if I

443
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:50,820
look into it there could be some case

444
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:53,549
somewhere but I really just care about

445
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:55,559
making videos right now right now use

446
00:19:53,549 --> 00:19:57,990
media I might change my mind so you

447
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:59,970
better behave which will bring me to the

448
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:02,850
final tangent that I have been going on

449
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:04,799
on this video which is PewDiePie versus

450
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:06,990
the media I thought about it recently

451
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:08,970
and it's like there's a completely

452
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:11,160
different version of me existing in the

453
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:13,740
eyes of of people that read these

454
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:15,690
articles about me and as opposed to the

455
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:18,900
people that actually watch my videos and

456
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:21,450
I think it's always because people that

457
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:23,040
watch my channel know who I am and

458
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:25,760
and I think you have a pretty good

459
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:28,559
understanding of what my values are and

460
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:31,559
that I'm not this horrible person that I

461
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:34,140
am have portrayed as in the media

462
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:36,270
obviously a lot of it is self-inflicted

463
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:38,309
like yes I have done a lot of these

464
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:41,340
mistakes but I think if you if you

465
00:20:38,309 --> 00:20:43,470
constantly reinforce the negative only

466
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:45,809
the negative things that someone has

467
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:47,580
done you're gonna create an ugly picture

468
00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:50,040
of a person I think no matter who you

469
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:52,410
are if you constantly list all the

470
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:54,990
shortcomings of any person that person

471
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:59,580
will be it look like a really bad person

472
00:20:54,990 --> 00:21:01,890
then there is never a balance or very

473
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:04,140
rarely at least a balance story about me

474
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:06,750
about the good that this channel has

475
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:08,730
done and all the positive things it's

476
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:10,320
always just the negative things listed

477
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:12,539
and I think that's why for

478
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,519
people I exist is like a completely

479
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:16,980
different character it's interesting I

480
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:20,159
think I will kind of give enough like I

481
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:22,139
don't really care about what people that

482
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,419
don't watch me think about me knowing

483
00:21:22,139 --> 00:21:27,809
that other people still know the truth

484
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:29,370
in a way and I find comfort in that then

485
00:21:27,809 --> 00:21:31,169
I don't feel like I need to go in some

486
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:34,169
sort of Oh guys I'm actually a really

487
00:21:31,169 --> 00:21:36,539
