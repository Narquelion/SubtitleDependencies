10
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:24,660

I played I would have killed them all

19
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:04,229
noob clearly not minecraft veteran oh my

20
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,720

no don't make me think about what

23
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:15,930
happens when I die what happens this is

24
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,790
like Toy Story the point someone needs

25
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:19,680
to make a movie about this what happens

26
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,869
to your minecraft dog after you die I

27
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,330
made a role generator that doesn't add

28
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:26,790
biomes but improves on the vanilla ones

29
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:30,210
that's pretty cool I especially like the

30
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:31,740
trees that are inside the ground I like

31
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:34,110
the mountains though that's pretty dope

32
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:37,170
like the curves gets not she doesn't

33
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:40,409

00:02:23,019 --> 00:02:26,019
terraria I remember though when terraria

49
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:28,120
came out it was like a lot of

50
00:02:26,019 --> 00:02:31,660
controversy and people saying it was

51
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:33,910
copying it's just 2d minecraft see I'm a

52
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:36,310
veteran so I remember the old Greaves of

53
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:51,040
the past blast resistant walls using

54
00:02:36,310 --> 00:03:00,130
waterlogged chairs stairs okay so these

55
00:02:51,040 --> 00:03:03,310
walls can't blow up won't because of the

56
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:08,260
water on the side oh okay that's pretty

57
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:09,820
cool actually see I figure that see I

58
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:13,870

59
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:19,269
water on the side yeah I think I saw

00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:26,940
sense but there's nothing to see the air

63
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:26,940

78
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:37,490
I don't think you can spawn them without

79
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,140
cheating or should I just wait for the

80
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:41,180

oblivion while he destroyed the orbs I

124
00:07:17,619 --> 00:07:22,419

125
00:07:19,629 --> 00:07:24,759
hitting it with a stake and half with my

126
00:07:22,419 --> 00:07:27,369
