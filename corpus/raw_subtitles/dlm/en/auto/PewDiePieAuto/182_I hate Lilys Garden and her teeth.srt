12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,120
the name of the game but I guess I have

13
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,670
to

14
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,809
it's Lily Garden what is this freaking

15
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:53,340
ad I found on Facebook

16
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:55,640
this is posted in August I assume that

00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,640

so we've seen obscure and strange app

21
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:15,320
commercials that makes no sense but it's

22
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,780
like they're trying to tell a story but

23
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:20,000
I can't help but think why it's like

24
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:23,180
watching the latest Star Wars film okay

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:35,390

00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:37,070
some more Lily's garden ants I don't he

27
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:40,430

00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:51,190
about the child and the consequences

00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:28,750
ex-husband and then going she looks like

38
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:32,709
she could go super saiyan so he'd make

54
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,500
pretended to be pregnant to get rid of

55
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,450
the guy then surely she should not slap

56
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:48,170
her mother for making out with him

57
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:50,240
that's something to think about now yes

58
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:52,430
they're trying to do a story they're

59
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:55,460
trying to do an epic thing about the

60
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:56,840
video game ads I get it but then they

61
00:03:55,460 --> 00:04:00,020
took it into the natural direction

62
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:01,220

be good what the hell happened what are

108
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:22,000
you talking about they actually used to

109
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:24,850
be a game involved so is this before or

110
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,140
after her pregnancy people need to know

111
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:28,150
who is the father

113
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:32,410
swear to god she'd be on twitch begging

114
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:33,940
begging I know it so I'm not gonna show

115
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:36,220
this commercial because it's age

116
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:39,400
restricted it's a family game everyone

117
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:42,460

however we can't have that game this is

119
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:47,140
actually really interesting

120
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,580
I wonder if Apple or Google are gonna

121
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:51,040
change their terms of service in a way

122
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:52,780
on looking at how they're marketing the

123
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,370
game because obviously they're just

124
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,930
looking at what the game itself is and

125
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:58,270
they're like okay it's fine I'm just

126
00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:00,640
very I'm just very very very confused

127
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:03,030

lily has an instagram which is

129
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:09,940

no good I knew I knew it I firmly

148
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:11,050
believe that the game just access to

149
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:12,700
fund ease and making shorts really what

150
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:14,880
they're passionate about is telling a

151
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:29,280

when the gameplay is in vigil its felt

155
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:39,130
like when you were a kid and video games

156
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:40,630
used to be so differently market them

157
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:43,150
because graphic point is good so you'd

158
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:45,100
get look he's insane cover art like this

159
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:47,890

super muscular babe and boob and wizard

161
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:52,600
and thing and then you play the game and

162
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:56,460
it's like oh oh oh that's the gameplay

163
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,460
it's actually quite good but still

164
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:01,000
that's what this is they're using the

165
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,830
same technique and they are tricking the

166
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,360

167
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:05,950
weirdos have I else have done

168
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,900
oh cool they also have the game called

169
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:12,310
cookie cats blast which is the exact

170
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:17,950
same gameplay absolutely scarred wow

171
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:20,830

00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:21,670
cookie cat blast instead and leave Lily

00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:28,210
this funny and bizarre and it gets

176
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:30,520
people to talk about it and that's the

177
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:34,360
point of advertising really it's nothing

178
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:36,250
new and I'm not woke or anything - for

179
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,200

just fun I don't really have a problem

00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:42,040
with it even though I hate Lily and hope

182
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,240
she dies in a fire because you two have

183
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,930
their new cyberbully

184
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:48,460
