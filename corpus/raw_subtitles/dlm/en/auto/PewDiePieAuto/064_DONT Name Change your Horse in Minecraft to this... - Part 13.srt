62
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:39,640
it could be another troll who knows at

63
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,680
this point but I'm willing to get

64
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:43,180
trolled if the result is what I want

65
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,519
okay we need four of them and I made

66
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:48,280
five for some reason I know Sven I know

67
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:51,700
and then when you yell the yellow die so

68
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:53,860
if I do this can I do letters how do I

69
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,959

00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:46,330
three four that's five and then it goes

85
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:48,760

wasn't the first video I uploaded I have

184
00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:39,300
a lot of videos that I just took down

185
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,190
because I think they're just so cringy

186
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,270
and I don't like them I mean I could

187
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:47,279
probably put them back now I don't

188
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:49,230
really care anymore but I do I yes

189
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:53,820
they're cranky none of my videos can be

190
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:56,070
cranky oh no I misspoke basically the

191
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,670
actual first video that no one has ever

192
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:59,310
seen

193
00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:01,350
I've tried desperately to find it I

194
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:02,910
can't find it the very first video that

195
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:05,010
I ever recorded was a Minecraft video

196
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:07,200
and it was like before minecraft was

197
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:09,060
getting popular I know I keep like ooh

198
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,480
I'm a veteran but literally no one

199
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:14,670
played Minecraft at this point and I

200
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,970
thought okay well wouldn't it be cool to

201
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:21,089
become like a Minecraft and here we are

202
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:23,520
nine years later well basically I

203
00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:25,470
thought it was so weird to record a

204
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:29,100
video like that whole concept was just

205
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:31,290
so weird to me no one recorded videos at

206
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,209
this time it wasn't like Let's Plays

207
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:35,459
wasn't popular people weren't doing

208
00:10:33,209 --> 00:10:37,110
minecraft stuff and I was just so

209
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:39,660
weirded out by I'm like who am I talking

210
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:41,760
to I have literally no audience am I

211
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:44,400
supposed to talk to people like there is

212
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:47,430
one I guess it was really confusing and

213
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,370
weird to make videos when no one else

214
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:50,110
really was

215
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:53,050
all right minority I would say compared

216
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:55,749
to now it's like people aspire to be

217
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:57,610
youtuber well as before people didn't

218
00:10:55,749 --> 00:10:58,120
really know what importance that was my

219
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:59,910
point

220
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,589
so I actually upload it to this website

221
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:05,170
that like posts videos and I thought

222
00:11:02,589 --> 00:11:06,850
okay cool I'll just ask these guys to

223
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:08,860
help load the video and they'll take

224
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:10,360
care of it and then that that way I'll

225
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:12,639
actually have an audience if they post

226
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:14,620
it but obviously they never posted it

227
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:16,449
and I couldn't find the video so I don't

228
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:18,939
have it anymore but my very very very

229
00:11:16,449 --> 00:11:22,089
very first video I have ever recorded

230
00:11:18,939 --> 00:11:22,660
was indeed a minecraft let's play that's

231
00:11:22,089 --> 00:11:24,639
right

232
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:26,829
that wasn't really what I was getting at

233
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:29,649
my main point was that oh god this won't

234
00:11:26,829 --> 00:11:34,930
work will it ah Frankie have I built

235
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:36,999
this all on a step wrong ah oh maybe we

236
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:40,360
can make like an optical illusion like

237
00:11:36,999 --> 00:11:42,670
these are on the right floor just places

238
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:46,449
in front and then we get the effect that

239
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:47,860
we want genius I also liked when I was

240
00:11:46,449 --> 00:11:49,899
starting out doing YouTube videos I was

241
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:52,149
in a really weird time where I didn't

242
00:11:49,899 --> 00:11:54,429
know what I was I wanted to do I talked

243
00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:56,050
about this a lot so I I applied for like

244
00:11:54,429 --> 00:11:57,939
different jobs and stuff like that and

245
00:11:56,050 --> 00:12:00,100
one of the jobs I actually applied for

Japanese door effect I don't really know

265
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:52,089
how to do it I'm hoping that it will

266
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,279
look good with like a trap door yeah

267
00:12:52,089 --> 00:12:55,809
that looks good oh yeah this is a gamer

268
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:59,139
moments when this is starting to look

269
00:12:55,809 --> 00:13:01,490
epic starting to look Nihon I think yes

270
00:12:59,139 --> 00:13:03,500
not you missed out man

271
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:06,589
could have made epic games together I

272
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:08,779
don't hate it it looks a bit alien

273
00:13:06,589 --> 00:13:12,500
I don't know but actually alright we

274
00:13:08,779 --> 00:13:14,600
need more trapdoors I don't really know

275
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:18,649
how to do the ceiling but we'll figure

276
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:22,760
it out soon so these doors will not

277
00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:24,950
actually work I know I like it I like it

278
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:27,020
we went in some midsummer the movie

279
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:29,870
yesterday which is base of this Swedish

280
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:33,860
tradition that we have oh boy was that a

281
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:36,320
trip now that was a film undeniably a

282
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:38,600
film I recommend it was good I love how

283
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,450
all the colors come together ceiling

284
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:45,140
time do I build a ceiling in white or a

285
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:47,930
gray or a cache up now this is a really

286
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:51,950
gamer question I know that you've been

287
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:55,100

looks better it ties it all nice

298
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:17,020
together

299
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:20,180
don't you agree Sven I just love

300
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:23,300
Japanese architecture it's so different

301
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:26,899
from anything else how will I do that

302
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:28,899
typical effect where it goes up right I

303
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:34,579

304
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:36,709

see that's yeah that looks good gamer

308
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:46,270
moment right there gosh I didn't think

309
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,920
the ceiling would be this complicated

310
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:51,170
it's really tricky building ceilings no

311
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:53,420
one talks about that in Minecraft my god

312
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:55,130
why am i spending so my time on the

313
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:56,870
problem is I can't just back up and look

314
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:59,390
how it looks like I have to look at it

315
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:01,579
at the micro scale and then get a mic

316
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:05,360
macro picture of it it's really tricky

317
00:15:01,579 --> 00:15:06,620
tricky D get off my house my Japanese

318
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:19,670
