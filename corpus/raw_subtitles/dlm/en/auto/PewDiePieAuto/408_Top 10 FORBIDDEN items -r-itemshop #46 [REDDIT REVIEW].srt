just gonna go ahead and say it terrible

44
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:11,099
bad bad bad idea not epic idea although

45
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,490
it'd be a freaking cool way to kill

46
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:14,590
someone

47
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:16,300

48
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:18,910
I don't even know how you would fire

49
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:21,070

50
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:22,600
hood I assume he's in the hood because

51
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:25,210
of the background and now no other

52
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,140
