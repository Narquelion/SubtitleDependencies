minutes and that was an episode and

274
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:11,880
people loved it and I was all that was

275
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:13,710
necessary people just couldn't have

276
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:18,030

that game to play and I mean I get it

278
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:22,680
it's a fun it's a fun game but then

279
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:26,760
people just for whatever reason made a

280
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:28,380

nothing we can do I always felt like

288
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:57,240
happy wheels had a lot of potential to

289
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,530
to be a lot bigger because it has such a

290
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,570
community behind it

291
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:07,680

00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:12,170
