10
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:31,529

11
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,110
ready to get on a plane and go meet rose

12
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:38,219
the love of my life for the lovers top

13
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:41,280
his life now why you see grabbing a

14
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:44,520
spatula and some mayo to ring and I plan

15
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:48,180
to ask rose to marry me oh my god this

16
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:51,120
is a joyous joyous occasion you should

17
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:52,949
always what is it with Americans is just

18
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,399
getting married I don't know where met

19
00:00:52,949 --> 00:01:06,439
you once married we married now married

20
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:13,680
gang no oh well since I met Rose I I

21
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:15,780
want to look young for her other lip is

22
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,210
that working out for you you're putting

23
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:21,600
mayo in your hair look at that look at

24
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:25,080
that burn I mean how can you not fall

25
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:28,259
for the sex spot so I have been dyeing

26
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:32,070
my hair and you're being dyeing your

27
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:35,640
hair with mayonnaise it irritates my

28
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:41,610
scalp so I found out that mayonnaise

29
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:44,640
makes it smoother and less dry oh I'm so

30
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:46,380
reposed why would you do that surely

31
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,640
there's some shampoo that you can use

32
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:52,229
for dry scalps Mayo I thought the point

33
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,640
of these was that the guy is rich and he

34
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:55,950
meets the girl abroad that wants a green

35
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,280
card what the hell is this I'm

36
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:01,920
self-conscious of my physical appearance

37
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:06,420
because Rose mayonnaise isn't going to

38
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:08,140
fix that surely there's younger than me

39
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:14,110
I smell like

40
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:16,750
an egg salad sandwich but really I want

41
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:20,040
to feel younger smells like an egg

42
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:20,040
sandwich yeah that'll do the trick

43
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:25,930
you look so young

44
00:02:22,569 --> 00:02:31,990
is that egg I just want to look young

45
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:38,920
for Rose mm-hmm I bet you he I bet you

46
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:39,610
he you know this is not about the hair

47
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,500

48
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:42,910

the least but she seems okay it was just

118
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:40,490
