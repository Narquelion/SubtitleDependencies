00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,870

00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:14,759

00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,230

real nice you could have gotten it for

7
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,850
Less that is literally worse than

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:24,600
accidentally killing your dog in

9
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:28,619
Minecraft okay not really but luckily I

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:30,599

12
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:34,739

00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:38,790

30

gotta say it feels amazing it feels

31
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,549
almost as good as hitting 100 million

32
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:17,250
subscribers the feeling is actually

33
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:19,259
completely mutual I usually use honey

34
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,950
for amazon because I buy a lot of dumb

35
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:24,210
stuff or my videos or suffer my home and

36
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:26,189
it's just nice to save extra money

37
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:28,229
because then I have more money to buy

38
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:29,670
more dumb stuff that I don't need I

39
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:31,079
think it's just a good feeling knowing

40
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,970

having me salad

59
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:14,010
this huge milestone of 100 million let's

60
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:16,130
get in with a video nine years ago I

61
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:24,239
uploaded my first video onto YouTube

62
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:24,959
this is what that video look like it

63
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,120
blew up

64
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,520
I got millions of views and I was big

65
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,170
ride away

66
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:35,220
no instead of twelve million views this

67
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:36,600
video had about three or four this is

68
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:41,340
what my content actually looked like

69
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:44,100
back in that day and I am back with

70
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:47,519
black ops with an awesome game of Search

71
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:51,319
and Destroy it wasn't good it wasn't

72
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:55,769
engaging it wasn't even original but I

73
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:57,360
loved it it took so when he uploads just

74
00:02:55,769 --> 00:02:59,880
for me to hit even a hundred subscribers

75
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,069
and hitting a hundred subscribers was

76
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,620
huge huge for me

77
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:09,959
and yeah today we're gonna celebrate cuz

78
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:11,489
I have 100 subscribers oh my it's funny

79
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:14,160
looking back to that video and what I

80
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:17,609
said I obviously had big goals

81
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:19,109
I liked aim even that big goals even

82
00:03:17,609 --> 00:03:22,140
though they might not be relevant at all

83
00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:24,570
but no no I don't want to I don't want

84
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:26,489
to be famous but at that time I was 20

85
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:28,410
years old I was living in Sweden in a

86
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:30,870
small flight I had just moved away from

87
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:34,380
home I have no idea what I was doing I

88
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:36,410
just knew I enjoyed it I was also

89
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:40,109
studying at University at the time

90
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:42,359
industrial economics and management my

91
00:03:40,109 --> 00:03:45,209
calling in life thanks to what I want to

92
00:03:42,359 --> 00:03:47,640
do so I decided this YouTube hobby I'll

93
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:50,160
probably have to set aside because I

94
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:51,959
should probably focus on my finals so I

95
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:55,140
upload a video saying I was going on a

96
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:58,280
break but in reality that was I was

97
00:03:55,140 --> 00:04:01,489
quitting it was it for me just can't but

98
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:04,430
my hobby and from

99
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:06,530
that right now so I'm sure a lot of you

100
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:08,900
I'm sure most of you will understand

101
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:11,120
that and I'm gonna miss you guys a lot

102
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:13,400
actually which was a pretty reasonable

103
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,930
choice to make considering I had about

104
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:18,079
five people that actually watched me

105
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:20,509
during this time but luckily the break

106
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,389
didn't last long just a few days later I

107
00:04:20,509 --> 00:04:24,680
was back uploading videos again I had

108
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:27,020
found what I was actually passionate

109
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,289
about and I wasn't ready to just let it

110
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:31,820
go

111
00:04:27,289 --> 00:04:35,330
I knew that a career in YouTube was so

112
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:37,190
far away it was more of a myth than a

113
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:39,169
dream at this point because people

114
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:40,940
didn't even know if it was possible but

115
00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:44,060
it was always at the back of my mind

116
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:45,889
that there was a tiny chance that this

117
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:47,930
could actually happen I was back

118
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:49,520
uploading videos and I tried out this

119
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:52,250
new horror game that had just come out

120
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:58,960
called amnesia and it was scarier than

121
00:04:52,250 --> 00:05:01,400
anything that it didn't even compare and

122
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,650
the top comment of this video really

123
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:06,139
says it it it is what started it all for

124
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:08,270
me at least I wasn't popular as soon as

125
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:10,699
I played amnesia but for the first time

126
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:12,680
the five people I watched my videos they

127
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:15,320
really enjoyed it and I could tell I was

128
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:17,270
on to something and this wasn't just new

129
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:19,460
for me it was a new thing on YouTube as

130
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:27,530
well and I had never played horror games

131
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:29,960
before it was genuinely horrible I made

132
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:31,849
montages and compilations of the best

133
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:35,120
moments where it's really just me

134
00:05:31,849 --> 00:05:37,940
screaming they're kind of loud they're

135
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,320
kind of obnoxious but you got a charm to

136
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:41,380
them

137
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,380
[Music]

138
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,990
eventually I had grown a thousand

139
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,910
subscribers but it was also clear I had

140
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:51,270
grown an audience that really cared

141
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:53,980
about me I used to be an introvert and

142
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:55,720
but YouTube really helped me open up

143
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:57,940
because on the other side there was

144
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,880
people that really appreciated the side

145
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:02,650
of me that I didn't show to anyone at

146
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,550
this point I had completely failed

147
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:08,140
school I'm sorry mom and dad

148
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:10,840
my passion was somewhere else and I

149
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:13,450
famously started selling hot dogs to

150
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:15,670
sustain myself but I look back at this

151
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:20,320
time with great memories because I was

152
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:22,870
finally pursuing my goal my dream not

153
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:25,540
selling hot dogs but making videos in my

154
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:28,570
spare time that is at this time I

155
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:32,260
managed to meet a girl online who later

156
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:34,660
became my wife I won't bore you with

157
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:37,660
every step of the way of the journey it

158
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:41,140
it's been long it had its ups and downs

159
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:44,230
I made a lot of mistakes on the way but

160
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:46,000
I've grown I feel like I have at least

161
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:47,710
and I feel like I finally come

162
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,260
internship with the responsibility I

163
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:53,230
have as a creator about a hundred

164
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:54,940
million subs too late but you know but

165
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:57,520
the channel has done a lot of good to a

166
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:59,650
lot of things I'm truly proud of we

167
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,540
literally raise millions of dollars to

168
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:03,760
charities and I'm really proud of my

169
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:05,950
audience for helping me do that looking

170
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:08,440
back at myself in that flight in Sweden

171
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:11,950
it's a very surreal experience I would

172
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:16,510
never ever have imagined this outcome

173
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:19,900
beyond my wildest dreams came true ten

174
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:22,960
times over a hundred times over I'm nine

175
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:25,750
years old there now I'm still awkward as

176
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:28,540
[ __ ] but I finally got confidence in

177
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:32,080
myself and I'm really proud of Who I am

178
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:33,580
today and instead of a hundred subs we

179
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,520
had a hundred million subs

180
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:38,770
[Music]

181
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,570
we did it I want to thank all the people

182
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:43,150
I work with over the past couple years

183
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:45,670

184
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:47,380
