114
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:14,810

00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:17,900
I'm genuinely it's so cool though I wish

116
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:20,780

118
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:25,010

119
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:27,530
anything cuz Android has the best

120
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:29,780
cameras there's water to the left of me

121
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:33,110
so if I take a wrong step

122
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:37,610
I'm practically screwed basically March

123
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:39,130
says sick and I decided to go out on an

124
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:43,070
adventure she sent me out as well

125
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:46,160
there's like a little shrine here oh I

126
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:48,770
hope this black screen will do for

127
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:53,530
footage for now I'm just keeping myself

128
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:56,870
company at this point I feel really sad

129
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:59,500
because we came on this trip to figure

130
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:02,300
out if we wanted to live in Japan or not

131
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:04,670
and to figure out if it was possible we

132
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:11,450
meet up with other people there's

133
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:12,770
someone else oh god there was another

134
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:16,130
person there he was making me your

135
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:17,980
noises I'm so scared we made it boys you

136
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:21,020
don't why do you not see anything

137
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:22,730
Android fix your camera we wanted to

138
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:24,590
figure out if we could live in Japan or

139
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:28,190
not so we met with visa people and we

140
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:31,160
met with tax people but it's just so so

141
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:33,860
so difficult that we feel a little

142
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:35,690
overwhelmed by it we knew it was gonna

143
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:38,930
be difficult obviously but there's a lot

144
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:40,910
of things to factor in with not just us

145
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:43,970
and the dogs and the time and the

146
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:45,260
housing it's just a big step that I

147
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:47,220
don't know if you're ready to take or

148
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:49,350
not I feel like

149
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,759
I really want to do it though I feel

150
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:52,290
like I don't want to look back in a

151
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:55,079
couple years and be like oh I wonder

152
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:56,730
what it was like I wonder what it would

153
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:58,769
have been like and I think I mean the

154
00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:00,540
unique opportunity to do something like

155
00:10:58,769 --> 00:11:02,040
this and I really want to try it even

156
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:05,759
though a lot of people you know

157
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:09,149
obviously it will be difficult so I feel

158
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:11,459
- a bit sad I don't know because we

159
00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:16,189
don't know what to do basically I made

160
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:20,430
it I'm alive that was insane

161
00:11:16,189 --> 00:11:23,160
never takes shortcuts ever again I'm

162
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:25,310
sure it's beautiful but I'm not doing

163
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,310
that again

164
00:11:25,319 --> 00:11:31,350
I was scared I'm really scared I'm

165
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:37,529
freaked out oh thank god

166
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:39,480
I'm genuinely relieved okay I made it I

167
00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:41,779
just wanted to show that I am live I am

168
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,779
Alive
