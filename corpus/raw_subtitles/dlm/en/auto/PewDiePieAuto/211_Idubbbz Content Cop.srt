00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:18,390
good evening I'm Papa Gloria I have

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:20,250
returned for Pugh news what's that we're

3
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:31,619
getting breaking news idubbbz

4
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:32,880
it's a simp that's impossible I don't

5
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:34,530
think I've seen the Internet

6
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,540
collectively lose their mind over

7
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:38,940
something in a very long time

8
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:43,700
so obviously I'm gonna talk about it

9
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:46,410
people dying of disease items Benson

10
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:48,030
let's talk about that this is a bit

11
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,890
awkward because I obviously I really

12
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,239
like items I don't know if I'm allowed

13
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,210
to call him a friend because we don't

14
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:56,250
really talk but I respect him a lot he's

15
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:58,020
a good dude I work with him and I think

16
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,149
a lot of people share this opinion that

17
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,100
I have on him if you enjoy my content at

18
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:04,650
least I would even go as far as say is

19
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,040
an important figure for the internet big

20
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:08,400
words

21
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:11,189
okay high pedestal so what happened what

22
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:16,130
happened with items to fall so far down

23
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:19,619
to the low disgusting despicable

24
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:21,960
unexplainable title of simp items and

25
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:25,380
simp those two things do not match i

26
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:27,180
dubs Chad I go to go boo go what's

27
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,710
happened well this whole thing started

28
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,450
about a week ago when items girlfriend

29
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,520
posted online that she was started and

30
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,900
only fans account for those two you

31
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,640
don't know what an only fans are

32
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,400
counties it's a website where people

33
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,810
discuss different political opinions

34
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,820
different literature I know I'm making

35
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:44,070
this joke only fans is basically where

36
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:47,009
you put either lewd photos of yourself

37
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,700
or straight up okay and you have to pay

38
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:51,840
for it

39
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:53,280
people pay that's the most outrageous

40
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,990
thing out of this whole thing I'm just

41
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,600
kidding this whole thing happened in a

42
00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:00,119
timely manner after she got a boob job

43
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:02,579
okay interesting I'm very excited to

44
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:05,280

00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:12,640
cosplay photo sets and more this is also

48
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:15,010
in another very timely matter of same

49
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,660
mean being just peak meme right now this

50
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:19,030
whole thing just could not have collided

51
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:19,630
more perfectly so now of course what do

52
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,340
people do

53
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:23,920
well they endlessly call idubbbz a

54
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:26,590
simple mine this has been going on for a

55
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,360
long time now let's hope that items

56
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:29,950
becoming a simp is what brings leafy

57
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,670
back from the dead alright I wouldn't go

58
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:33,850
that far

59
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:35,980
Sam babe it's 4 p.m. time for my only

60
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:39,760
famous photo shoot yes honey can I go

61
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:42,040
now I guess the fact that even items can

62
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,989
become a simp really makes me depressed

63
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:47,980
yeah the fact that even I end up

64
00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:50,560
Hercules himself fell for wall man s mhm

65
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:52,780
I can't believe items Bridge Raiders by

66
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,400
becoming a sip himself people are

67
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:55,900
calling items the same that just proves

68
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,080
the word sympathy lost all its meaning

69
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:00,700
really you don't think so you don't

70
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,590
think it lost its meaning like any other

71
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:06,160
meme that gets popular online okay

72
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:08,590
boomer I thought simp was the person

73
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,150
that you know paid for the stuff but

74
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:12,459
didn't get any of the action I thought

75
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:14,440
that was the definition of the same like

76
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:16,300
the people that do anything for a woman

77
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,250
just in hope of something they'll pay

78
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,049
him they'll do they'll do their laundry

79
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,940
they'll wash the ranch they'll do

80
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:24,030
whatever okay I'm sorry I'm sorry he's

81
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:26,680
the same I'm joking I'm joking

82
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:28,989
it's it doesn't make any sense

83
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,180
I'm just saying per definition you're

84
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:33,519
false so people were naturally curious

85
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:36,100
what is idubbbz think about this very

86
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,900
supportive she responds I need to hear

87
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,910
this from the man himself I don't

88
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:42,190
believe it unless it comes out of M's

89
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:44,290
month okay if this is true

90
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:46,540
ian has to say the n-word at least three

91
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:49,570
times this cannot be real it was silent

92
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:52,150
for a week what is going on here guys a

93
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:55,630
week passes and items posted I'm done

94
00:03:52,150 --> 00:04:00,880
I'm done no more mr. nice sin and of

95
00:03:55,630 --> 00:04:04,120
course response simp clever you got him

96
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:06,970
good okay so then two weeks passes I

97
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,590
think and after the silence items has

98
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:13,269
finally uploaded a response video

99
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:15,609
shutting down his fans sex workers items

100
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:18,070
complaints addition decided to say it

101
00:04:15,609 --> 00:04:19,150
didn't really fly well it's got a third

102
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:20,680
of the dislikes

103
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:22,330
I think it's safe to say that a lot of

104
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,300
people didn't really buy it so what

105
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:26,050
happened what do you say let's watch for

106
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,569
those of you were

107
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:31,659
unaware of the drama I recently brought

108
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:33,610
upon myself I'll fill you in to be fair

109
00:04:31,659 --> 00:04:35,620
it was discovered that brought upon the

110
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:37,270
drama yeah you didn't do anything it's

111
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,530
not yeah it's not your fault it's not

112
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:40,389
your fault okay

113
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:41,979
I don't think Ian is exclusively looking

114
00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:45,520
for a girl friends that wants to do only

115
00:04:41,979 --> 00:04:46,180
fans to cast I be aware that would be a

116
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,580
weird King

117
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:51,789
anything from double penetration all the

118
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:55,979
way over to lewd cosplay and everything

119
00:04:51,789 --> 00:04:59,620
in between and I think all of it is cool

120
00:04:55,979 --> 00:05:01,569
yeah I know I I didn't think it would be

121
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:03,460
a controversial opinion either to be

122
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:05,319
fair I don't think it is controversial I

123
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:07,270
think says a lot of people engage with

124
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:08,919
it so we'd be pretty hypocritical to

125
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:11,860
have a problem with it are these people

126
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:13,150
that do preneur whatever are they're not

127
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,409
allowed to have a relationship I don't

128
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:16,030
think people are making that argument

129
00:05:14,409 --> 00:05:17,469
either I think it's more the fact that

130
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:20,469
you people just don't want to date these

131
00:05:17,469 --> 00:05:21,940
people I think that's isn't true but Ian

132
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:24,219
doesn't have a problem with it that

133
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:25,569
being said Ian acknowledges that most

134
00:05:24,219 --> 00:05:27,580
people don't have an issue with it and

135
00:05:25,569 --> 00:05:29,469
just making fun of in light of the

136
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:31,870
situation with memes good amount of

137
00:05:29,469 --> 00:05:33,759
people are just doing the reasonable

138
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:36,099
thing and just making jokes and laughing

139
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,680
about it but then addresses the people

140
00:05:36,099 --> 00:05:41,080
that are taking it a step further but

141
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,990
there's a whole nother group of people

142
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:47,770
who feel personally devastated and

143
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:50,169
betrayed you lied to us first of all I'm

144
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:52,659
not your [ __ ] dad disappointed either

145
00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:55,349
this was like father to me I can't

146
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:55,349
believe this happened

147
00:05:55,469 --> 00:06:02,860
Ian addresses one of the specific person

148
00:05:58,599 --> 00:06:04,930
who's obviously this guy's like 15 isn't

149
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:06,789
making fun of kids I leave his job I

150
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:09,099
thought we were past this what happened

151
00:06:06,789 --> 00:06:10,960
no shut the [ __ ] up you dumped him you

152
00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:14,379
don't get the haha funny yourself out of

153
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:18,490
this one you're I mean it's funny but at

154
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:19,840
the same time and then addresses people

155
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:21,370
haven't been calling in a hypocrite

156
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,259
began saying that he has actually been

157
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:25,029
consistent with his views on women and

158
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:26,469
sex work during the years and showed

159
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:28,120
some example of that but I guess it's

160
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,840
out of sight out of mind it's not a

161
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,900
problem

162
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:35,589
you think these reasons would actually

163
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:37,750
do a smidgeon of research because like I

164
00:06:35,589 --> 00:06:39,700
did it and I found the potential

165
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:41,530
hypocrisy in

166
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,780
I say in the past and it's it's pretty

167
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:46,270
[ __ ] consistent the funding for this

168
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:49,630
shirt is actually very very low tank

169
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:51,610
town pink town USA South corporate all

170
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:54,370
over the walls you know like I'm not

171
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:56,050
saying that women should be sterilized

172
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:58,810
or shouldn't be I'm just saying that

173
00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:00,990
there is the market for it so it makes

174
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:04,270
sense that they would do it I would say

175
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:06,040
consume but never was that part of my

176
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:07,570
argument it's just flavor

177
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,340
it's just flavor because people I've

178
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:11,200
been put I saw some people post this for

179
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:13,810
example Europe or just admit it

180
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,790
your office where you yourself out

181
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:18,400
online you yourself out in front of your

182
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:20,230
family and your friends Europe or plain

183
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,330
and simple which isn't really an

184
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:23,800
argument it's just I think it's from the

185
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:25,840
green screen video that he'd that right

186
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:31,000
it's not him necessarily taking a stance

187
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:32,440
although it comes across as a thing you

188
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,060
then address another youtuber who made a

189
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:39,400
approach and a cons chart of why this is

190
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:42,400
a bad idea I wanted to talk more about

191
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:44,770
all the takes that people have and this

192
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,560
guy that we're gonna watch has pretty

193
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:51,430
much listed all of what okay okay

194
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:55,210
okay suppose nothing all right cons

195
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:57,610
everyone can see what he sees for a few

196
00:07:55,210 --> 00:08:01,030
bucks well apparently she's making Bank

197
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:03,370
I need to do it Ian you need to remove

198
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:04,300
pedestal pedestal I'm pretty sure that's

199
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:07,540
not how you spell it

200
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:09,610
Internet is forever archive future jobs

201
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:11,350
question mark to be fair I'm pretty sure

202
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:13,420
anyone that makes the decision to put

203
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:15,520
nude photos of themselves online

204
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:18,070
deliberately have already weighed these

205
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,380
consequences you know like saying the N

206
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:22,920
word online deliberately same sort of

207
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:25,210
deal right which I would ever doubt

208
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,800
realistically what would the pros be I

209
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:28,420
haven't watched a video I don't know if

210
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,390
he actually leased at any I can imagine

211
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:34,720
it but you make money probably easily

212
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:36,400
easy easy you can work from home I'm not

213
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,030
saying it's super easy like got it like

214
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,120
a girls

215
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:42,880
I understand it's tough I understand but

216
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:45,370
you can work from home my job bc2 okay

217
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:49,720
you get to feel wanted and desired

218
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:51,730
that's nice I like that but then I think

219
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,990
I think that a lot of this boils down to

220
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:55,570
is that you sort

221
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:58,090
create an intimacy with other people

222
00:08:55,570 --> 00:09:00,130
online generally in a relationship

223
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:01,840
having that intimacy for a lot of people

224
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:04,180
at least I would argue for most people

225
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,980
is something special that you to share

226
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:08,320
but it seems also like people are

227
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:09,610
projecting their fears that if they let

228
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,470
their girlfriend do something like this

229
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:13,660
then she will immediately start banging

230
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:15,550
other guys one day you know one day you

231
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:17,080
start an only fast account the second

232
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:18,700
day Ricardo comes knocking on your door

233
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,740
and and you become your wife's boyfriend

234
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:22,390
essentially I mean I'm not saying that's

235
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:24,640
gonna happen but the science is there we

236
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:27,370
have all the data it's gonna happen Ian

237
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:30,040
watch out for the card okay Conn's we

238
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:32,890
have everyone can see what he sees for a

239
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:35,380
few dollars what exactly do you think

240
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:39,100
I'm seeing do you think she's shooting

241
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:41,770
fireworks out of her post screening The

242
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:44,500
Matrix Reloaded down they're not a

243
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:47,290
mystery it's a tee dude and then there's

244
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:50,110
no special it doesn't become less

245
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:52,390
valuable the more people see it I mean I

246
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:54,940
think it's right in this sense if there

247
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:57,550
was past photos if there was past photos

248
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:59,830
it would not be less valuable but if its

249
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:03,700
current photos I would argue yes

250
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:05,380
my body and my person is the most value

251
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:07,600
list thing on the planet I think

252
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:09,730
[ __ ] and a guy being shirtless it's the

253
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,400
same things just to be fair just play

254
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:14,650
devil's advocate okay it hurts me to do

255
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,810
this Internet is a forever archive so

256
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:19,480
there's no I regret delete all button

257
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:22,090
that's not quite there I don't know why

258
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,620
this point yeah again they yeah I'm

259
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:25,630
pretty sure they waived these options

260
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:28,150
already I don't really see other people

261
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:29,980
having this concern for someone why do

262
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:31,780
you care that much about it really if I

263
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:33,460
had to politicize this whole thing I

264
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:34,420
would say that a lot of people that

265
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:36,190
washes idubbbz

266
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:38,950
throughout the years and enjoy his

267
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:41,860
content most of them probably have that

268
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:43,870
like this overly edginess tend to have

269
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:46,930
conservative views around relationships

270
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:49,180
that's just a majority standpoint which

271
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:50,740
obviously clashes hard against what he

272
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,750
even said in the beginning of what his

273
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:54,850
actual opinions are which he hasn't

274
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:56,650
apparently never really shared I find it

275
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:59,050
hard to believe that this many people

276
00:10:56,650 --> 00:11:01,000
actually care deeply about this someone

277
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:02,110
else's relationship but I think it's

278
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,330
because it's idubbbz

279
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:05,750
the golden boy if this was anyone else

280
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:08,600
no one really would really

281
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:10,490
so after this video he makes up a couple

282
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,899
more points they were good I know I a

283
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:13,759
lot of its points I don't have a problem

284
00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:15,620
with to be fair it's like everyone that

285
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:17,360
reacts to this is basically like well I

286
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,680
wouldn't like it from if my girlfriend

287
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,199
did that I would not be okay with that

288
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:23,120
him doing that but if he wants to do it

289
00:11:21,199 --> 00:11:25,100
then I guess it's fine but people didn't

290
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,470
really buy this video people didn't

291
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:29,569
really buy his argument which is kind of

292
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:30,709
a unique thing because throughout the

293
00:11:29,569 --> 00:11:32,959
years that he and it's just been

294
00:11:30,709 --> 00:11:35,149
consistently putting out great arguments

295
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:38,089
that people can get by I mean he even

296
00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:40,279
rationalized can n-word how do you do

297
00:11:38,089 --> 00:11:41,990
that but he's also sticking out for his

298
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:45,199
girlfriend and this whole thing comes

299
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:47,089
across as a bit tad bit defensive it

300
00:11:45,199 --> 00:11:48,410
felt a bit cherry-picked and I think

301
00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:50,720
that's why a lot of people are pointing

302
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:52,220
out he seems like The Crying happy-face

303
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,199
voice I could be more or whatever it's

304
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:56,329
called falling you knew that there's a

305
00:11:54,199 --> 00:11:58,910
hint of sadness people are detecting

306
00:11:56,329 --> 00:12:00,889
people are good okay there's a hint of

307
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:03,379
sadness behind the ice in this video Ian

308
00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:05,300
are you okay which is probably true for

309
00:12:03,379 --> 00:12:07,790
someone that's been sucking drama you

310
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:09,500
know what we're seeing is just the tip

311
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:11,600
of the iceberg what Ian Ian's girlfriend

312
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,699
is going through is probably ten times

313
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,490
worse with people harassing digging

314
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:18,019
through old stuff private messaging all

315
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:19,370
these sort of stuff that kind of spirals

316
00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:20,930
up over a long time yeah it's

317
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:22,879
frustrating I'd be pissed too and I

318
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:25,970
think that's why that's the reason why

319
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:27,769
he comes across as if he's pretending to

320
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:29,089
be okay with this when he really is not

321
00:12:27,769 --> 00:12:30,649
another thing that people have been

322
00:12:29,089 --> 00:12:32,569
saying is that items has been deleting

323
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:34,790
content but either it's made fun of

324
00:12:32,569 --> 00:12:36,889
other people deleting content quickly

325
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:38,750
leaving comments chin a weight idubbbz

326
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:40,970
actually delete comment this one had 2k

327
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:43,490
likes I can see why you would think this

328
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:45,589
but from my experience I get so much

329
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:47,180
spam on my channel everyone that posts

330
00:12:45,589 --> 00:12:49,129
the same comments will eventually get

331
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:51,829
switched out I don't think he's delaying

332
00:12:49,129 --> 00:12:53,720
comments and if he was I think he's in

333
00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:55,370
his right to do so because there's some

334
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:58,339
pretty harsh stuff about his girlfriend

335
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:59,180
here in the list stole art multiple

336
00:12:58,339 --> 00:13:02,149
times

337
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:04,009
she stole art I don't know I don't like

338
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:06,800
these lists because even if it's true or

339
00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:08,000
not it's such oh he already knows about

340
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,790
these things I don't think it's just

341
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,370
like what it doesn't feel fair to bring

342
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,449
this up in this context but it seems

343
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:16,610
like a lot of people share this

344
00:13:14,449 --> 00:13:17,779
sentiment of her having only fence it's

345
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:18,850
the least of her worries

346
00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:21,069
she's a pretty bad

347
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:23,440
person so people love idubbbz they don't

348
00:13:21,069 --> 00:13:25,180
like his girlfriend basically so this

349
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,759
almost serves as a people are either

350
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:30,220
concern for idubbbz or that she was

351
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:32,860
gonna leave it in the future or people

352
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:34,420
are using this as a haha told you so in

353
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:37,750
the future when she leaves you for

354
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:40,240
Ricardo listen I can I wouldn't be okay

355
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:41,889
with it but I can I have to admit at

356
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,019
least Susak super adding some sort of

357
00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:44,769
confidence by saying publicly that he's

358
00:13:44,019 --> 00:13:46,750
okay with it

359
00:13:44,769 --> 00:13:49,750
if he's truly you're fine with it who

360
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:51,699
cares who cares why do you care what's

361
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:54,069
the conclusion of this I think you know

362
00:13:51,699 --> 00:13:56,920
it also goes down to whether it's right

363
00:13:54,069 --> 00:13:58,779
or wrong for a person to do this to

364
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:01,029
