there are actual employees that push you

87
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:52,560
the remains of astronaut vladimir camaro

88
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,439

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,439
why does he look like an alien vladimir

91
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,120
i gotta look this up

92
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:02,480
it was the most highly experienced

93
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:05,519
qualified he was in the soyuz program

94
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:08,159
in 1966. the cosmonauts

95
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,599
knew that the spacecraft had major

96
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,000
safety problems

97
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,879
but if he refused to fly then someone

98
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
else would be

99
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:18,560
forced instead so he did it anyway

100
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,919
he chose to fly to protect gagarin i

101
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,639
guess that's his colleague

102
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:24,639
and insisted before the flight that his

103
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,199
funeral be open casket

104
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,400
so that the soviet leadership could see

105
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,120
what they had done

106
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,360
so he knew he was gonna die holy [ __ ]

107
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,800

108
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,199

114
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,440
they were working 12 to 14 hour days

115
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,280
camaro was ordered to reorient the craft

116
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,320

not insane anymore that's kind of cool

227
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,200
though scientists claim

228
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,040
that future biotechnology could be used

229
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,040
to make prisoners feel as if they were

230
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,880
serving a thousand-year sentence

231
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,519
in a matter of eight hours drugs could

232
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,640
be developed to distort the minds of

233
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,800
prisoners

234
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,399
into thinking time is passing slower can

235
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,760

thank you scientist but no thank you

243
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,519

gorgeous gorgeous damn in china which

287
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,519
required

288
00:11:53,720 --> 00:12:00,079
510 000 tons of steel to construct

289
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,279
and generates 11 times more power than

290
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,839
the hoover dam

291
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:05,200
it's so massive that it slowed the

292
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,600
rotation of earth

293
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,560
is that true maybe we shouldn't be doing

294
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,880
that

295
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:13,200
scientists can you stop you know we're

296
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:16,079
so [ __ ] right

297
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,639
we need to just stop okay i i think it's

298
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,920
important

299
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:22,480
dude we need to stop

300
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,000
scientists needs is that we're so many

301
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,399
believe the dam will ultimately

302
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,760
result in catastrophe some concerns

303
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,600
include the dam trapping pollution

304
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,639
spawning earthquakes and landslides

305
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,959
uprooting citizens more than 1.3 million

306
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,720
people

307
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,560
already forced to relocate the

308
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,320
government finally conceded the project

309
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,680
was ill-conceived

310
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,920
thank you so the shift in the mass size

311
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,200
impacted the rotation of the earth due

312
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,320
to the momentum

313
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,880
the moment of inertia that's so cool

314
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:54,720
and scary dad rushes into the track and
