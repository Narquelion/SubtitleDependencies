a thing

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,840

[Music]

10
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:33,780
my name is Colt I'm 33 years old I live

11
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:36,719
in Las Vegas Nevada and I dress up my

12
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,910
cats see the thing about Colt is I don't

13
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,820
think I've seen him raise his voice or

14
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:45,000
get upset a single time in this shop oh

15
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:47,940
you look so beautiful I work as a

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,309
software engineer and I live with my

17
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,949
cats baby girl goddamn that's a creepy

18
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:54,989
Ken what the hell that's terrifying

19
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:57,120
this is chillin in the closet the thing

20
00:00:54,989 --> 00:01:00,870
about Colt is that he lives with his mom

21
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,399
and he's over 30 years old by doing

22
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:05,180
everything around the house I don't

23
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,710
think he even knows how to make a bed

24
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:09,600
she's saying that that's like a good

25
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,920
thing you clearly haven't taught him to

26
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,540
take care of himself

27
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,680
we'll get into it we'll get into all of

28
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:19,439
the nuances oh my god guys it's crazy I

29
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:22,409
thought maybe I could search outside the

30
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:27,150
country maybe find a girl and then I met

31
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:29,680
Larissa Larissa lives in Brazil and

32
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:33,040
she's 31 years old

33
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:35,680
I can't find the guard in your country

34
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:39,040
then find a girl online cringe who would

35
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,380
do that I had sent Larissa a message and

36
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:45,790
to my surprise she actually responded

37
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:47,890
and we started talking it wasn't long

38
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:50,740
before I decided I really wanted to meet

39
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:55,270
her in person so we worked it out and

40
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:57,340
decided to meet in Cancun Mexico when I

41
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:59,530
got to the airport in Mexico Larissa

42
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:06,040
walked around the corner I saw her in

43
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:07,930
like slow-motion shots of our cheese's

44
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:12,910
she was the most beautiful when I'm ever

45
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:15,220
seen I was like I'm done this is it it

46
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:18,459
was like all the boxes were checked

47
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:20,830
she's beautiful she's smart and she

48
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:24,880
seemed pretty cool what's the idea

49
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:27,240
and she's beautiful she's smart and I

50
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:33,760
guess guess she's alright

51
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:36,250
living with my mother Oh after five days

52
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,200
I new spoiler she's not cool with it

53
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,850
what girl likes the fact that they live

54
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,190
with their mom that's the recipe for

55
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:43,800
disaster I see my tambourine didn't pick

56
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:47,230
the supreme spell herself

57
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:49,750
pathetic the comments have no chill as

58
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:57,870
always if this guy was a spice he would

59
00:02:49,750 --> 00:03:01,690
be flower mr. personality over butter

60
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:03,910

I'm like I love you too proud are

62
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:07,710
leaving for the airport I decided to

63
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,250
propose to her

64
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:13,020
and wise eyes why nice why not propose

65
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,520
after you've just spent a vacation

66
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,860
together that seems like a good

67
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:19,740
reflection on how you you will get on

68
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:22,020
for the rest of your life please don't

69
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:23,670
marry someone before you at least live

70
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:25,650
with them a little bit because that's a

71
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:27,300
big adjustment to make it and you need

72
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:45,480
that to work out for a managed to work

73
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:47,780

you're gonna get the visa you can't just

82
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,250

what oh she's not happy especially for

84
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,980

85
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,980
any sense

86
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:34,080

to bed weeping writing my diary and how

92
00:04:54,210 --> 00:05:04,890
sad I am but it's merely a week probably

93
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:08,250
less than a week I've been drama drama

94
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:11,790
drama okay so she finally arrives where

95
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:18,840
he lives in Las Vegas and a car with no

96
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:27,630
air-conditioning which sounds awful here

97
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:30,770
we go and of course she's not happy

98
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:33,360
about it oh please

99
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:36,180
Larissa has only been in Las Vegas for

100
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:41,420
three hours and she's literally not stop

101
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:41,420
complain since we arrived here Larissa

102
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,950
ha ha you're so silly she's like I'm not

103
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,950
letting this go where's my good flowers

105
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:06,640
welcome to the desert there's nothing in

106
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:08,680
Las Vegas unless you go to the strip I

107
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:10,630
bet you had this image in her head that

108
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,280
is gonna be amazing I get that she

109
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:14,410
sounds very bratty but it's not that

110
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,120
unreasonable to want flowers after a

111
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:17,710
long flight first time you see each

112
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,810

113
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:23,490
why am i defending her I don't know

114
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:26,860
I think Larissa and I will have some

115
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:29,770
small hurdles to overcome initially I

116
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:35,080

00:10:50,770 --> 00:11:01,870
what's your annual income uh $2,000 per

172
00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:04,510
