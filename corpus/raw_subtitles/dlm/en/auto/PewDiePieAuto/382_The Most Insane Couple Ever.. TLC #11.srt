22
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,640
to meet

23
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,479
the love of his life who lives in the

24
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,920
amazon rainforest

25
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:17,439
in brazil men packed five military

26
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,000
grade boxes to go there and his mom

27
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,960
i don't know where gave him her hair

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,119
very normal

29
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,400
she actually just uh snuck out and gave

30
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:24,799
me a little bit of her hair from her

31
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,960
comb

32
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,960
to take with her why it means a lot

33
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,960
they can't communicate properly with

34
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:37,200
each other so they use this app

35
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:40,320
go on my father said

36
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,119
hotel paul was so scared of

37
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,280
swimming up his urethra that he did not

38
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,920
just wear two layers on his pee pee

39
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,079
he also wear this pair of pants all

40
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,079
right

41
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,240
he's wearing pants that outfit what else

42
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,000
happened oh yeah

43
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,920
paul admitted that he was uh he had a

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,600
criminal record and before uh

45
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,000
letting her react to it he runs off in

46
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,880
the jungle what is happening

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,399
it's just very confusing and i wanted to

48
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,759
follow up on some of these clips that's

49
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,000
why i summarized it

50
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,039
the first thing i want to follow up on

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,239
is the

52
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,800
before the flight the whole military bag

53
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,000
thing

54
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,800
so apparently he he changed his flight

55
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,840
because uh

56
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,120
they wouldn't let him grab his five bags

57
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,160
brazil

58
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,360
all right uh it's five for uh brazil two

59
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,200
bags older

60
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:34,080
huh that's two that pay for three more

61
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,080
two bags only

62
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,519
paul actually just need two bags the

63
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,920
other three is his mom's

64
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,440
hair they're packed with it brazil yeah

65
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,760
i've always checked five

66
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:51,840
that's it i always check five i always

67
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,840

68
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,360

69
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,160
the baby and that was my responsibility

70
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,480

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:28,720
oh how is that mama putting up with that

156
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,320
damn how mama put up with that i'm ready

157
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,400
to leave my life behind forever

158
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,600
in the united states but the problem is

159
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,400
nobody can fly right now

160
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,199
with more than two bags i got a lot of

161
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,120
things

162
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,360
so instead of flying with two packs i

163
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,960
decided i don't fly at all

164
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,800
uh gifts uh baby clothes the baby bed

165
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,639
plus 35 years of my life here in the

166
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,759
united states into five pieces of

167
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,280
luggage

168
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,199
is that everything out of there looks

169
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,039
like it ah

170
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,120
my only option is just change the flight

171
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,800
just wait 30 more days

172
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,960
this way in 30 more days and come back

173
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,840
with everything it's not a terrible

174
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,840
option

175
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:07,199

282
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,519
these are obviously

283
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:05,200
the most rare and precious figurines of

284
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,720
all time and anyone that got him

285
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,320
should be got them lucky because we're

286
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:12,000
never doing the number thing

287
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:14,160
ever again however we are now doing

288
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,519
for those of you who didn't get a chance

289
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,160
the beta version

290
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:20,320
it's still respectable uh but it's not

291
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,720
the 100 million club edition

292
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,480
and uh it doesn't have any number it's

293
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,000
just pewdiepie on it if you guys are

294
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,200
interested and still want to figure in

295
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,160
and maybe you missed out on the

296
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,079
opportunity

297
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,839
you can still get these and now there's

298
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,480
no waiting time on these

299
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,000
so if you order it there shouldn't be a

300
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,560
long wait like last time

301
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,680
there's no pre-order basically again if

302
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,440
you're not convinced

303
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,050
wait does the legs not come off on this

304
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,240

[Music]

306
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,000

307
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,000
version

308
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:56,000
that ain't gay that's just epic

309
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,560

she didn't want to talk she's like

358
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,000
pulling teeth together to talk

359
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,200
i mean you've been married since what

360
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,399
you know you met dad when you were a

361
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,839
teenager and you've been married since

362
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,240
you were high school sweetheart so i

363
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,079
mean

364
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,360
you've been making it work for years we

365
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,360
had a very hard first

366
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,720
couple of years but we worked it out you

367
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,800
need to talk to each other

368
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,760
and if you can't work it out you need to

369
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,440
come home

370
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,959
because this can't happen again and

371
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,399
again and again

372
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,959
i don't want to tell you what to do but

373
00:13:54,399 --> 00:14:00,079
i think you know that's nice

374
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:01,680
one thing that brings me difficult it's

375
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,680
too many differences

376
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,800
way too many differences so in your

377
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,920
honest opinion do you think me and

378
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,279
koreans should stay together or you

379
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,959
think we should get divorced

380
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:11,360
i think you should make up that decision

381
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,760
your own girl god damn adult what the

382
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,839

384
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,600
break up because god damn me

385
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,680

389
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,000

401
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,680
the reasons why you're upset

402
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,959
is it wearing a body is that a

403
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:25,680

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,360
from him why does he have a bulletproof

407
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,120
vest

408
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:41,839
we can't wait to see what paul has been

409
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:41,839
wearing during the pandemic

410
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:56,160
you're determined not to talk to my [ __ ]

411
00:15:53,920 --> 00:16:00,399
know

412
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:03,519
you know oh oh you know

413
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,560
that's the one you should know you

414
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,360
should already

415
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,320
know i'm sorry if i offended your family

416
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,320
and your culture

417
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,320
i would like to really work through this

418
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,440
he's been willing to offer a bit of his

419
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,759
mom's hair in a bag

420
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,720
i think that's pretty generous of paul i

421
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,720
think karine should access

422
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,680
you saw that karine did not accept just

423
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,000
accept

424
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,839
paul's mom's hair and look how

425
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,839
devastated that was for paul

426
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,600
will they ever be able to recover from

427
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:40,320

excuse me it is

534
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:42,799
i prefer my house in brazil over this oh

535
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:44,640
so the lot ran is how much 500

536
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:47,280
okay we can't afford a whole lot with

537
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:50,559
our savings 500 bucks to rent that

538
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:54,720
where no

539
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:57,039
no dude that's this is this is doable

540
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,640

okay they need to fix rent man

544
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,640
are you serious rent does not make sense

545
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,320
to me it's like another form of tax

546
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,880
it's in some way or another where the

547
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,880
rich people who sits on property just

548
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,640
cash in money right that doesn't seem

549
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,159
right of me this isn't ideal but it's

550
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,600
what we can afford until i can make some

551
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:22,559
money get something better

552
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:25,520
so what do you think about it you know

553
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:31,440

560
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:03,120
bruh i mean i'd be disappointed too i

561
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,159
don't know if it's paul's fault

562
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,400
necessarily

563
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:08,559
this is the last video this is the last

564
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,400
follow-up of paul and karine

565
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,480
while i was in brazil i boarded my dogs

566
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,840
at a training facility

567
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,679
it really feels great to finally have my

568
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,760
dogs back did you have a big thing away

569
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:19,760
i didn't even know you had dogs

570
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,039
we looked a few places to live and

571
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,880
korean hater i didn't even know you

572
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,400
could leave dogs at a training facility

573
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,720
that'd be great edgar

574
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,400
uh you're going on a vacation man but

575
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,159
someone moved out of this old house in

576
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,320
the same trailer park so i decided to

577
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:35,919
get it before somebody else got it

578
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:37,679
our house that's kind of cute

579
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:40,080
this is basically a studio home

580
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:45,039
everything is just one big room

581
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:48,400
and it's really small hmm

582
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:49,360
yeah maybe if you build a loft or but i

583
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,799
think it's definitely the best

584
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:55,840
affordable option that greeny

585
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:55,840
will accept okay how hard can this be

586
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,840

587
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,440
