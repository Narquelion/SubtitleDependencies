87
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:36,950
we can explain all this evil [ __ ] that's

88
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,970
happening down there or drugs come on

89
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:39,530
I'm the only one that gets to

90
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:42,830
hyperbolized around here there's got to

91
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:45,260
be another explanation right this stuff

92
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:47,030
I saw it's like there were these old

93
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:49,400
soldiers that there were bodies they

94
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:52,760
were dead but then they came alive and I

95
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:55,220
saw something this uh old lady I mean

96
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:57,050
she was batshit crazy like dinosaur old

97
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:59,420
not that that's a bad thing but she just

98
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:02,780
like up and vanished on me Alex wasn't

99
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:05,770
the only Alex there were things walking

100
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:07,810
around with his face on them Alex's face

101
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:11,870
it was horrifying

102
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:15,620
let's time up okay this place is too

103
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:19,160
freaky freak back here I'm saying yeah I

104
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:20,810
mean like something is going on here so

105
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:28,040
what do we know for sure but we can all

106
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:30,400
agree on nothing

107
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:32,680
I look over nothing we're wasting time

108
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,030
whatever we do we have to do it now

109
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:37,490
pretty sure we can hop back onto the

110
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:39,920
dupe from here flah said we need the

111
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:41,770

you okay but I'm thinking that tower

117
00:06:50,349 --> 00:06:55,720
means there must be another radio around

118
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:58,539
here right yeah good chance we could use

119
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,970
the power that keeps coming on - there's

120
00:06:58,539 --> 00:07:02,789

that would the theory about the gas

151
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:05,300
causing things would add up because once

152
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:05,300
he left outside he stopped seeing stuff

153
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:16,460

[Music]

391
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:51,160
hey man come on just put this yeah I

392
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,930
don't want to tell engineer but if we

393
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:54,070
knew he was gonna do it so at the same

394
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:56,590
time I don't know what do something that

395
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:59,470
messes it up I don't care if he lives

396
00:29:56,590 --> 00:30:01,000
he's not the main characters okay that's

397
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:02,950
really cool about the brief reader so

398
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,210
the fact that we picked to keep it

399
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:06,310
probably saved one of the cares of life

400
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:08,350
and at the QuickTime event it was you

401
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:10,060
had to produce W at one point and he

402
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:13,180
probably would have taken it from us

403
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:15,070
that point so there was many put you

404
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:21,280

405
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:30,490
