00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,599

194
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:55,199

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,520
yeah i'm not really talking to you right

199
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,039
now right would you spend three hours on

200
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,520
the moon or three months in europe

201
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,639
would you spend three hours on whatever

202
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,639
the [ __ ] you said

203
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:11,039
would you spend three months on the moon

204
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,879
or one what the [ __ ] did you say

205
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,160
uh obviously by the way i hate this

206
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,560
[ __ ] question

207
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,160
the moon i can go ahead to europe at any

208
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,919
time of my god damn life

209
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,199
i'm not always gonna get the offer to go

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,280
to the moon am i

211
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,639
so i'm obviously going to the moon

212
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,879
they're not equal

213
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,560
you should phrase the question like this

214
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,599
if you had the choice

215
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,080
to go to both but which one would you

216
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:36,000
pick

217
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,519
first how about that god damn so stupid

218
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,080
three months in europe three months in

219
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,599
europe really i hate those questions

220
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,520
because you can make that reaction to

221
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,680

this it's it's really fun video wise but

302
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,800
it's not like an eye opener

303
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,640
yeah seeing it in real life being like

304
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,839

my whole dating curtain like now

308
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,800

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,600
dating in real life or even dating

310
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,480
generally it

311
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,360
generally takes a lot longer a lot more

312
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,600
talk a lot more

313
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,880
understanding but this was like oh done

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,480
in five seconds

315
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,079

316
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,839
whole person in five seconds

317
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,079

enjoy them all as people and i

466
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,360
i picked them all because i do find some

467
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,840
part of them attractive but

468
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,480

469
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,799

obviously

472
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,720

someone if you don't want to but

474
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,480
she did say in the beginning didn't she

475
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,280
that all her dates were literally just

476
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,039
like meeting up

477
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,039
and not having a connection and now she

478
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:25,280
