13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:45,539
you guys I was thinking cuz you know

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,539
look here's the goal I made from last

15
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:51,809
episode I made so much gold oh I

16
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:56,610
couldn't make this on God now I'm stuck

17
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:59,100
I could uh it's fine I could make this

18
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:01,530
tower into like and I don't want to

19
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,780
forget my bros from the past from season

20
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:07,409
one of the anime I thought I could make

21
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,970
this into a tower of gold for my men so

22
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:10,590
this would be for Jurgen smirking one

23
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:13,619
this would be for year against Mergen

24
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:15,990
two they get one tower each let me know

25
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:18,540
if you have any ideas or designs and

26
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:21,810
I'll steal them so I also got accused of

27
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,970
cheating which is fair but now for the

28
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,729
reason you would expect some ones that I

29
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:29,250
was cheating because they fix zero tick

30
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:34,829
farms so this is impossible I know it

31
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:36,150
doesn't work it stopped working okay I

32
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:39,329
was collecting what I had already

33
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:42,299
connected but today we have a main big

34
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:45,899
mission isn't that right Willoughby

35
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:47,600
defeatist Mita listen to me how's it

36
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:50,810
going over here you're doing a good job

37
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:54,240
so far no no escape

38
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:57,360
what the hell shut up

39
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:00,149
alright we're heading out basically last

40
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,820
episode we found a bastion I think

41
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:04,530
they're called so there's this new

42
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:06,630
really cool structure in the game but

43
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,090
there's four different types of bastions

44
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:11,239
that can spawn and we only find one of

45
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,000
them so I'm really curious that shut up

46
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:15,370
my god

47
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,130
speaking to you you interrupt my

48
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:23,200
sentence stupid bit why was I my god

49
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:24,670
alright as always we have to pay our

50
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,670

51
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:29,260
