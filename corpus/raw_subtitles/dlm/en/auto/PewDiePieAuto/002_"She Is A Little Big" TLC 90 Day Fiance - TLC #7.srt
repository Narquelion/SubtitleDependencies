trying to find out not if what his

44
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:59,280
intentions are wrong Dan who is this guy

45
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:02,820
he must be absolutely the worst Nicole's

46
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,710
a beautiful girl yeah but she's not you

47
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:08,429
know the most beautiful girl out there

48
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:09,929

49
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:14,040
describing you like that on TV

50
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:21,989

00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:23,310
is a person not the best way there's

52
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:24,840
this expression if you don't have

53
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,700
anything nice to say they don't say

54
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,530
anything at all and I feel like that

55
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:31,590
should apply your kids on national

56
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:33,269
television at least I know what she's

57
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:35,250
coming from it's like she's questioning

58
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:37,079
what this guy's motives are I guess

59
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:39,750
we're just gonna have to find out he's a

60
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:42,989
very handsome man and damn floor gang

61
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:44,430
house understand with this 20% muscle

62
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:47,340
increase absolutely

63
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:49,769
so Nikola takes off to Morocco that's

64
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:52,200
where her lover or her life is I've been

65
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:53,400
to Morocco it's a very unique place I

66
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,109
think if you're not ready for the

67
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,840
culture change that it will be a big

68
00:02:55,109 --> 00:02:59,459
shot but it's very beautiful and the

69
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:07,200
food is amazing take good care of my

70
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:14,760
baby I'm trusting you I'm so curious

71
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:16,470
yeah that sounded sincere I think it's

72
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,169
good that he's spoken to the parents at

73
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:20,730

74
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:23,190

went met my wife online in a completely

76
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:26,549
different country but Morocco that's

77
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:29,910
very different from America

78
00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:32,609
I hope she's ready for it I really do

79
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:34,680

87
00:03:48,359 --> 00:03:53,010

Morocco you know no maracas and maracas

99
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:29,250
don't want to it sound so forth I don't

100
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:31,350

[Music]

action did you hear that okay okay can

112
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:22,290
we stop hugging now okay when she

113
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:24,750
dropped her bag so dramatic I almost

114
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:28,170
threw up these comments are always so

115
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:30,330
over-the-top my god I'm hungry are you

116
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:31,050
seriously cut what the hell it's a long

117
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,650
flight

118
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:36,870
don't be so judge for the first time I

119
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:40,320
see that she's pretty and you know it's

120
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:43,020
cute when I see her I mean her body I

121
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:53,490
was surprised that she's bigger little

122
00:05:43,020 --> 00:06:03,570
bear I'm guessing she never sent him

123
00:05:53,490 --> 00:06:05,790
full body pics oh so they go to the

124
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:08,730
market to buy some food it's like being

125
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:09,270
like Dan if the foodie market was so

126
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:11,760
good

127
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:14,550
I mean that's not what you say when it

128
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:21,720
was good but damn all the veggies was so

129
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:23,280
good there all the food was my god it's

130
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,730
a bit different from potato chips on the

131
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,730
dinner table

132
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:36,470
this is definitely different when I'm

133
00:06:33,349 --> 00:06:39,409
used to if I even see fresh products

134
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:42,710
it's usually in a supermarket in the

135
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:46,340
frigerator section that's what I'm used

136
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:55,729
to for fresh ingredients okay so time to

137
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:59,810
go find some of the nuts they're going

138
00:06:55,729 --> 00:07:00,819
to get some fresh chicken you had them

139
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:07,129
in the box

140
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:11,870
goddamn the smell of chicken it's the

141
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:13,520
best why are the chickens baby I like

142
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:15,949
how she's acting like this is so strange

143
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,750
do you be do you not know where your

144
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:20,509
food comes from seems like everyone's so

145
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:23,389
attached detached from from it I would

146
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:24,409
never hurt an animal by chicken and beef

147
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:27,259
omnomnomnom

148
00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:29,000
goddamn eat what you want obviously but

149
00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:31,219
I feel like we're so detached from our

150
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,529
food we made the process so easy for us

151
00:07:31,219 --> 00:07:35,330
that's why my philosophy is that I'll

152
00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:36,979
eat what I would kill because killing

153
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,779
things is uncomfortable most people

154
00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:41,229
wouldn't and at least there's a level of

155
00:07:38,779 --> 00:07:43,520
respect there instead of completely

156
00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:44,900
distancing yourself from what goes

157
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,789
through to these animals which isn't

158
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:49,159
fair a lot of the times it came a little

159
00:07:46,789 --> 00:07:50,930
bit preachy there but I don't know just

160
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:52,819
like oh it's so weird it's in the cage

161
00:07:50,930 --> 00:08:06,680
we'll move but you're gonna kill it

162
00:07:52,819 --> 00:08:09,800
world I don't really want to see you

163
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:12,680
know that was taken before I go to cook

164
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:16,099
it like I just want it to be make you

165
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:19,069
feel bad huh everyone hypocrite except

166
00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:21,440
me oh I'm joking today as I'm taking me

167
00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:23,029
some market in Marrakesh and technically

168
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,979
we're not supposed to hug or kiss in

169
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:25,729
public but that's gonna be really hard

170
00:08:24,979 --> 00:08:27,979
for me

171
00:08:25,729 --> 00:08:32,149
oh no God girl you're in a different

172
00:08:27,979 --> 00:08:37,370
country I've been there

173
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:55,279
Wow making out with snakes and I didn't

174
00:08:37,370 --> 00:09:02,959
miss out on that oh she did not like

175
00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:04,639
that and whether you agree or not aware

176
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,230
it is right you're still visiting

177
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:08,449
someone else's country you have to be

178
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:10,310
respectful of that you can tell us you

179
00:09:08,449 --> 00:09:11,930
took that personally too I mean that's

180
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:16,899
not even the case this is how it is

181
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:16,899
there oh my god [ __ ] me

00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:30,010

290
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:06,720

Moroccan didn't you fall in love me

293
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:14,910
because I'm not rocking if I see stuff

294
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:19,800
like this hit me it doesn't mean that I

295
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:22,380
don't love you okay I just woman bye I

296
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:24,420
love you no way and if I said things

297
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:27,029

298
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:28,800
that I give up a knee or something you

299
00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:30,720
know it's like she's given up on herself

300
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,720
I'm now your perfect woman

301
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,370
boohoo me that's not it at all he's

302
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,200
trying to help you that's what I'm

303
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:37,800
picking up at least curious where you

304
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,350
guys think

305
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,940
honey's under and change you he's asking

306
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:43,980
to kindly respect their culture he

307
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:46,950
deserves the green card for his patience

308
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:48,450
as a Moroccan myself I'm super surprised

309
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:50,220
he stayed calm during this argument

310
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:51,870
because most guys would throw a tantrum

311
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:54,630
because you don't play no games with no

312
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:56,880
Moroccan and especially you do not risk

313
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:58,440
disrespect once culture he he's been

314
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,580
very calm throughout all of this maybe

315
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,470
he's just pulling it through for the

316
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:03,930
cameras I don't know but I can't really

317
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:06,570
fault him on anything so far and want to

318
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:08,820
be healthy but I don't think I need to

319
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:11,070
change myself for a man for him to love

320
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,730
me because if he loves me she loved me

321
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:15,570
for who I am

322
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:17,820
that attitude is like saying I'm perfect

323
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:20,160
and I should be praised for being

324
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:22,470
perfect at all times obviously you love

325
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,600
someone you love someone but encouraging

326
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:26,250
someone to be better shouldn't be met

327
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:39,030
with oh you don't think I'm perfect oh

328
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:42,390

339
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:53,620
pushing her too hard and congrat later

340
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:53,620
after she is done with the exercise

341
00:17:56,470 --> 00:18:04,789
physically I'm talking to Nicole but

342
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:14,809
it's not like it just like 55% you put a

343
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:16,880
number on it are you attracted to me no

344
00:18:14,809 --> 00:18:20,720

love it it doesn't seem like that

349
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:36,980
interesting premise of a show but it

350
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:38,419
truly is so finally they go through this

351
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:45,529
big fight and I'm not sure what's

352
00:18:38,419 --> 00:18:47,289
happening as always you want to escape

353
00:18:45,529 --> 00:18:51,010
from Nicole or just go upstairs

354
00:18:47,289 --> 00:18:51,010
sorry that was a load joke

355
00:18:52,490 --> 00:19:02,540
what is happening can't even look as a

356
00:18:59,809 --> 00:19:05,660
single person I am just a bunch a group

357
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:09,290
of Americans I'm just American to him

359
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:15,470
feel for her let me try and be nice it

360
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:17,570
seems like she knows about the issues

361
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:20,420
