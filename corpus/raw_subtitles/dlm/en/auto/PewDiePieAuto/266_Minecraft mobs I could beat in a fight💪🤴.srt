1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,230
that's right which of Minecraft mobs

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:05,520
could I beat in a fight let's settle

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,649
this once and for all

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,240
I've always wanted to know this even

5
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:11,400
before I play Minecraft

6
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,320
I made this cute little template this is

7
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,030
obviously based of the idubbbz made a

8
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,010
video and he did it based on someone

9
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:19,710
else it's tearless which he made popular

10
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,750
I've always wanted to do them so here we

11
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,880
are you can download this template put

12
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,010
them into yourself if you want to but

13
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,019
this is however my choices and I beg you

14
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:30,510
to respect them now like any moral

15
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:31,080
choices it depends on the context here

16
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,600
okay

17
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,190
the context of this fight is that we're

18
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,469
fighting to the death all right hence

19
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,790
the death bars here anything lining in

20
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:40,230
here is as good as dead

21
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,290
we're fighting to do that for whatever

22
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:45,750
reason I don't know maybe Africa's

23
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:47,520
nothing whatever we've done to each

24
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,289
other we both want to murder each other

25
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,149
okay that's the context of this fight

26
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:53,129
it's not the kind of fight where our

27
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:55,579
shake hands all that was epic no

28
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:58,140
basically me versus chicken for example

29
00:00:55,579 --> 00:01:00,989
chicken Frick my mom I want to kill this

30
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,780
chicken and I likewise did two dead

31
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:05,610
sheep you understand what I mean okay

32
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,640
I would I would even if he would freak

33
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:10,830
my mom I wouldn't fully kill him as easy

34
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,080
as it would be I would beat him as close

35
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:16,100
to death as possible to learn him a

36
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,270
lesson what the hell is this video I

37
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,799
don't see myself losing against a

38
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:22,470
chicken I think my chances are pretty

39
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,570
strong I'm bigger I'm stronger I don't

40
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:26,549
have a beak but I could probably

41
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:29,250
simulate one pretty well who should we

42
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:31,740
do next the slime yes this is a good one

43
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,119
the Siamese very big and very slimy but

44
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,979
it seems from my experience that you

45
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,720
should keep punching it it will go down

46
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:39,119
there's a big area it's got a large

47
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,310
hitbox so I could just keep punching it

48
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,560
would be okay I would absolutely kill

49
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,149
the slime the problem is however with

50
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,950
the tiny slime because their god them

51
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:47,820
adorable there's no way I could kill the

52
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,470
tiny slime

53
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,729
I'm gonna leave them in the middle it's

54
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,259
kind of like a slime in Minecraft it

55
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:54,329
doesn't do any damage to it they can

56
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:56,310
just keep attacking me I don't care it

57
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:59,189
can be in the middle the gas in

58
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:02,729
Minecraft would 100% kill me the gas

59
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:05,340
however will fit perfectly in the pool

60
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:07,799
of I would run in fear so well that I

61
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,270
would somehow manage to escape I feel

62
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:11,849
pretty confident that I would be able to

63
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,770
escape a gas so he doesn't qualify so

64
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:16,260
far I'm winning now

65
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:18,630
the Salman in Minecraft is a tough one

66
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:20,130
obviously if it's in water it's a

67
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:22,800
different story it's gonna be pretty

68
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:24,720
difficult he has that extra aqua buff

69
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,420
but I would still definitely snap its

70
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,700
neck I eat fish I'm a pescetarian sorry

71
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,260
Salman now the card however is very

72
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:34,110
different I don't think I could kill a

73
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,250
card I think the card would definitely

74
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:37,020
kill me just kidding

75
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:40,290
I'd kill it a little less than the

76
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:42,570
Salman the skeleton arrow guy it he's

77
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,980
got infinite arrows okay how am I

78
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:45,570
supposed to be the guy with a freaking

79
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,760
weapon yeah I'm pretty sure they would

80
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:49,860
kill me probably at some point bleed to

81
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,540
death I gotta be honest here I know I

82
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,400
know everyone looks up to me and thinks

83
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,960
that I am this indestructible being

84
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,460
that's perfect in every single way and

85
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,650
oh my god so beautiful

86
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:00,660
the skeleton in Minecraft will kick my

87
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:03,600
ass I'm not gonna lie next we have the

88
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:05,220
bat in Minecraft absolutely destroy it I

89
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,660
wish there was another bar actually I'll

90
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:09,120
make another bar he gets a special

91
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:11,190
little category I call it I kill them so

92
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,080
hard they are removed from the game why

93
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:15,600
they bother having the bat in Minecraft

94
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,250
I don't know it's gone I'm sorry if you

95
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,680
like the bat in Minecraft I'm sorry

96
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:21,390
alright making your progress the horrors

97
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,220
in Minecraft if it is a tough one

98
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:25,230
realistically would I be able to kill a

99
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:27,180
horse with my bare hands probably not

100
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:28,560
realistically would the horse be able to

101
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:31,260
kill me if they really wanted to

102
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,020
probably yes however we have another

103
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:36,060
category is I would rather die than to

104
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:38,730
take the fight if it's my own pet of

105
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,470
course you're again there he belongs but

106
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:43,380
I'll still put him here for the sake of

107
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:45,630
it dolphin it's a tricky one again it's

108
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:47,900
like the water element a dolphin on land

109
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:50,640
yeah he'll win

110
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:52,680
dolphin on the water however it's a

111
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,240
little trickier I'm just gonna go ahead

112
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,220
and say it's a dolphin on land so I

113
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,200
would have to kill it it would be

114
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:00,510
tougher though but yeah it will die they

115
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,640
will die I can imagine I would be able

116
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:03,900
to kill dolphins aren't as smart as they

117
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,330
think they are everyone is like Oh

118
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:09,680
dolphins so smart so epic not they're

119
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:12,209
not smart there's no new ones in this

120
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,110
it's just me would I kill them or not

121
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:15,510
okay

122
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:17,700
the llama it's one of those things where

123
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:19,859
I probably think I could kill it cuz I

124
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:21,930
don't care it's it's not a horse I can't

125
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:24,660
have it as a pet I would definitely try

126
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:26,190
it would be a good fight but the fact

127
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,680
that they spit I think would freak me

128
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:29,360
out so much

129
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,460
they would probably end up winning I

130
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,199
don't like when people spit at me if you

131
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:35,660
ever come in a fight with me if you just

132
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,250
spit I don't know I shouldn't reveal my

133
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:39,199
secret never mind just ignore all that

134
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:41,300
just don't spit out of me okay

135
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:45,020
I don't want your germs which one should

136
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:48,560
I do next so many choices so little time

137
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:51,110
ah yes the parrot if it's IKEA bird I

138
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,880
would put him in a category of I would

139
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:55,130
rather die than to take the fight

140
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,830
however I don't think I care but could

141
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:58,669
take me on I'm sorry I don't think he

142
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:01,160
could kill me

143
00:04:58,669 --> 00:05:03,949
so I would probably have to immobilize

144
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:06,560
him now if it's a normal parrot I would

145
00:05:03,949 --> 00:05:06,919
100% snap its neck so I would put it

146
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,889
here

147
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:12,169
the shulker box is a weird one they make

148
00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:13,789
these fart noises I don't see that that

149
00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:15,620
could be a threat actually now think

150
00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:17,479
about it I also see myself getting my

151
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:19,190
thumb is stuck in that box thing and

152
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:21,410
that would hurt a lot but I feel like if

153
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:23,479
that happens that would channel my anger

154
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:26,509
so much that I would actually manage to

155
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:28,310
pry the whole thing open and just stuff

156
00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:30,500
the whole little shelter thing let me

157
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:32,570
get a bigger look at it be able to stuff

158
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:35,449
that old thing in my aunt in my family

159
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:38,000
in my face so I would definitely kill it

160
00:05:35,449 --> 00:05:39,710
no wait it's over here yeah yeah so far

161
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,470
it's pretty clear that I'm the superior

162
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:45,860
being here I've deliberately not picked

163
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:48,020
up any of the hard

164
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:50,570
I mean it's the same it's the same as

165
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:52,280
IKEA bird they definitely belong here I

166
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:55,280
would rather die than to take the fight

167
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:57,470
donkey are like horses but less superior

168
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,210
they kind of go with a llama but they're

169
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:01,699
less strong and a llama to be honest

170
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:03,650
because they don't spit just don't spit

171
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:06,260
at me okay I don't like it why would

172
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:08,210
people do that polar bear obvious one

173
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:10,130
they would kill me it's a freaking bear

174
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:11,870
same word panda while we're at it they

175
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:14,870
would kill me okay let's be honest

176
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:16,760
however baby polar bear it's gonna have

177
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:18,680
to go I'm a nice person I'm not gonna

178
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,990
kill a freaking baby I will immobilize

179
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:23,000
it to make them understand that I'm the

180
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:24,500
better man I wouldn't do too much though

181
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,780
just a little bit this bar is basically

182
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,360
actually shulker will die I'll kill the

183
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:31,159
shocker this bar is basically

184
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:33,849
immobilized yeah that makes sense

185
00:06:31,159 --> 00:06:36,360
I like that I'll immobilize them sheep

186
00:06:33,849 --> 00:06:39,180
immobilized

187
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,740
if it's a life and death scenario I know

188
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,330
people are gonna judge me it's a life

189
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:45,270
and death scenario I hope you understand

190
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:48,419
that villager I would probably have to

191
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:50,789
immobilize as well so I could put them

192
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:53,460
in my Frick shame burr basically village

193
00:06:50,789 --> 00:06:54,750
or zombie obviously I have to kill but

194
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,699
then again they're probably stronger

195
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:58,919
than a villager man there's so many

196
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:00,840
choices and scenarios I never thought I

197
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:02,400
would ever have I think they have the

198
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,780
advantage because zombies are annoying

199
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,879
and no one likes them because zombies

200
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:07,770
are like this never-ending source they

201
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:09,180
just don't stop they just don't stop I

202
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:11,069
would run out of stamina

203
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:13,740
zombies have infinite stamina everyone

204
00:07:11,069 --> 00:07:16,229
knows that the pufferfish is so cute how

205
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:18,479
could I kill this it's a frickin box

206
00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:20,669
dude would I rather die than to take the

207
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:24,150
fight of a pufferfish the question is

208
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:26,159
more would I kill this thing and I think

209
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:28,710
the answer unfortunately sorry Marcia

210
00:07:26,159 --> 00:07:31,169
she loves puffer fishes the answer is

211
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:33,569
that I would probably try to immobilize

212
00:07:31,169 --> 00:07:37,349
it but I would I'm probably so strong

213
00:07:33,569 --> 00:07:42,000
that in the process I would I would let

214
00:07:37,349 --> 00:07:44,550
it live it lives ok puffer fish lives

215
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,849
everyone that's great what else do we

216
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:47,129
have

217
00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:49,110
there's so many ok wither skeleton

218
00:07:47,129 --> 00:07:51,300
obviously they have a weapon what am I

219
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:52,979
gonna go hey we're definitely finally

220
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:55,139
and they will definitely kill me not

221
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:56,969
gonna even sugarcoat it same it

222
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:58,529
villagers they have a weapon although I

223
00:07:56,969 --> 00:08:00,599
have a feeling I could probably steal

224
00:07:58,529 --> 00:08:02,099
the weapon so it's less likely that they

225
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:04,259
would win if I steal the weapon out

226
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:06,569
chiapas cubic little balls off I would

227
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:08,669
do it and make him eat him that which

228
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:10,740
wouldn't kill him I think that gives me

229
00:08:08,669 --> 00:08:12,810
an even more advantage now that would be

230
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,699
a fair fight which obviously have

231
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:16,889
advantage they have potions they have

232
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:19,080
all these weird things I don't know what

233
00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:20,909
the witch do exactly however I'm

234
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,680
terrified of witches growing up in

235
00:08:20,909 --> 00:08:24,479
Sweden next to a forest and washing the

236
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,729
which movie has scarred me for life

237
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,860
Blair Witch Project it's not even scary

238
00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:30,659
but in my head it's scary I hate them

239
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:32,039
however you might think that's a

240
00:08:30,659 --> 00:08:34,229
weakness but I feel like that would

241
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:35,969
always built up anxiety that I have

242
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:37,740
years and years I've been walking home

243
00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:40,079
from my friends and through the forest I

244
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:42,000
will channel all that and murder the

245
00:08:40,079 --> 00:08:43,740
witch it's not murder its self-defense

246
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,380
just to be clear it's not murder all

247
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:49,120
right but she will die stone golem uhh

248
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:52,240
I couldn't kill a stone golem come on

249
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,970
however I could probably convince sone

250
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,370
Golan with my charm and sexual being and

251
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:59,050
since he is one as well to calm down a

252
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:02,350
bit which will probably leave me

253
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:04,060
immobilized oh yeah these what are these

254
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:06,010
again it's like an ender

255
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:08,290
termite or something why are they in the

256
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:10,750
game they only confuse me it's like a

257
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:13,600
10% chance that they appear if you throw

258
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:16,480
an ender pearl they 100% belong and I

259
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:19,150
would kick their ass and and I kill them

260
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,850
so hard they are removed from the game

261
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:23,800
you are welcome everyone applause to me

262
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:25,240
you're welcome

263
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,890
uh who else do we have is there anyone

264
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,050
else I want to kill that bad no I don't

265
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:32,140
think so not yet at least the wither

266
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:34,660
skeleton I feel like belongs and I would

267
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:36,640
run in fear so well that I would manage

268
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:39,640
to escape I know this is kind of a

269
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,320
cop-out but it's the truth do you want

270
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,450
me to not be honest now you'd think

271
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:46,360
villagers same as skeleton because they

272
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:48,820
have they have their weapon however they

273
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,440
recharge a lot slower and they don't

274
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:51,850
have infinite arrows I would say this is

275
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,890
a pretty fair fight I could probably

276
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:54,430
take them on zombie piggie however would

277
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:56,770
kill me

278
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:58,930
real piggy I would absolutely immobilize

279
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:01,630
it it's the most pointless video of all

280
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:03,190
time and her dragon I think would I

281
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:05,650
think I'm gonna have to just accept that

282
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:07,660
ender dragon will kill me this giant

283
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:08,950
what are they called Ravagers I think

284
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:11,590
I'll just have to accept that they will

285
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:13,750
kill me I think that's fair if I freaked

286
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:17,670
his mom I think I probably deserved to

287
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:20,560
die anyway I probably want to die anyway

288
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:21,310
there's very little where in this area I

289
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,950
wonder why that is

290
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:25,870
spider would probably kill me they're

291
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:28,180
giant they're gross I wouldn't even want

292
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:30,460
to fight them although they are so gross

293
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:33,040
and so nasty that I would probably

294
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:34,660
persevere and I would probably try my

295
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,160
best to kick the rats actually God

296
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,900
spiders are gross I hate spiders

297
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,060
see that's the thing I think I think if

298
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:41,980
I go so far as to win

299
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:43,900
I would probably kill it I would

300
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:46,000
definitely make sure it dies you know

301
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:47,770
what III you know what I'm gonna do it

302
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,630
I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do it I'm

303
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:53,080
doing it I'm doing it I'm doing it

304
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:54,790
that's right so it kills so hard they

305
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:57,160
are removed from the game it had to be

306
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:59,830
done gamers I don't like spiders knotch

307
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:01,160
do something call up Microsoft I don't

308
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:03,290
know I'm sure you have some

309
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:06,589
points it's a cow stronger than a llama

310
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:08,449
no I was really mad at a cow would I be

311
00:11:06,589 --> 00:11:10,160
able to kill it cows are big men you

312
00:11:08,449 --> 00:11:11,600
could tip them over though I've done

313
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,639
that I mean I haven't done that you can

314
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,860
tip cows over and then they're

315
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:17,509
completely destroyed and was it well

316
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:19,519
stirred down I could probably get a lot

317
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:21,319
of good punches in I feel like I could

318
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,110
go for the kidneys I go for a specific

319
00:11:21,319 --> 00:11:26,899
organ I could probably break him so I'm

320
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:27,980
gonna put him here on the edge I don't

321
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:29,899
really I don't really want to kill all

322
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:31,759
immobilize him he'll have to get a liver

323
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:34,069
transplant or something like that but

324
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:36,379
he'll live baby zombie I would

325
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:39,350
definitely kill and yeah that's right

326
00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:40,759
that's right I kill them so hard they

327
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:41,720
are removed from the game you are

328
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:43,939
welcome

329
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,980
the real zombie however I would

330
00:11:43,939 --> 00:11:49,220
immobilize because I want them to live

331
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:51,439
with the sadness and sorrow over knowing

332
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:54,019
that I killed their child snowman

333
00:11:51,439 --> 00:11:56,540
obviously belongs in there I would I

334
00:11:54,019 --> 00:11:59,329
would not want to hurt them territory I

335
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:01,550
guess that that's what this is cat

336
00:11:59,329 --> 00:12:03,350
obviously belongs in no wait

337
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:04,550
cat OH yeah I'll kill a cat I don't know

338
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:06,649
I'm just kidding I'm kidding I would

339
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:08,000
immobilize a cat I would definitely I

340
00:12:06,649 --> 00:12:09,889
know you probably have pets and maybe

341
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,139
you have a cat but listen if a cat comes

342
00:12:09,889 --> 00:12:14,449
at you it's super dangerous you're gonna

343
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:14,990
have to immobilize that kitty vex do you

344
00:12:14,449 --> 00:12:16,430
remember these

345
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:19,699
I'll show it good you probably can't see

346
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:21,139
these these guys I feel like they would

347
00:12:19,699 --> 00:12:22,939
have a good chance against me they're so

348
00:12:21,139 --> 00:12:25,040
small and so fast and they've actually

349
00:12:22,939 --> 00:12:28,189
killed me a lot of times in Minecraft

350
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:30,860
however I will of course kill it and I

351
00:12:28,189 --> 00:12:31,310
would kill it so hard is removed from

352
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:33,769
the game

353
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:35,959
does anyone want these in the game no

354
00:12:33,769 --> 00:12:38,360
one wants these in the game Mojang kill

355
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:40,819
it until it's gone those phantom beings

356
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:43,160
god I hate them every time I'm trying to

357
00:12:40,819 --> 00:12:45,110
do a montage yeah I'll kill them so hard

358
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:47,180
they removed from the game I'll break

359
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:48,800
his wings now actually I won't do that

360
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,899
yeah I like that it will break in his

361
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:54,559
wings and like properly torture him like

362
00:12:50,899 --> 00:12:57,110
he tortures me every time dog of course

363
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:59,680
easy I would rather die than take the

364
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:02,750
fight no way I'll let him absolutely

365
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:05,600
belongs here Hedgehog let me show it

366
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:08,180
because it's so tiny the hedgehog will

367
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,399
definitely I'll stomp on it even if it

368
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:12,380
hurts my feet the pain will get meaning

369
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,310
knowing that it's gone and I would also

370
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:16,020
add these to kill so hard they

371
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:17,490
are gone from the game because I don't

372
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,090
understand what their purpose is and I

373
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:20,370
don't like them

374
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:22,380
this isn't growing in John rly I think I

375
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:23,490
should change these okay that looks

376
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:26,130
awful I like it

377
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:30,440
guardians oh god I hate these so much I

378
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:30,440
would murder them god damn I hate them

379
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:35,790
the magma flying fire shooting thing

380
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:38,820
would probably kill me they can shoot

381
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:41,610
fire come on Vindicator things I would

382
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:43,529
probably uh I would probably kick same

383
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:45,630
as villager yeah probably a little bit

384
00:13:43,529 --> 00:13:48,630
more than Vindicator though the giant

385
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:50,220
fire magma thing killing although it's

386
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:51,810
it hot like the nether cuz that would

387
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:53,940
hurt my knuckles it would be harder to

388
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:55,770
kill than a slime wouldn't it plus they

389
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:57,210
also have fire resistance it's got to be

390
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:59,400
worth something slime doesn't have it I

391
00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:02,940
would probably have to put it here no it

392
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:06,570
has to die nevermind zombie pigmen

393
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:08,820
riding a chicken is probably as even as

394
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:11,940
any fight could ever be I think that's

395
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:12,960
probably my strings exactly if this was

396
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,480
the middle point

397
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,830
yeah we're equally strong basically it's

398
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,270
what I'm saying this makes the baby

399
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:19,920
slime a bit confusing I think you should

400
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:22,770
just put it here he's probably my

401
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,960
perfect match in a fight a chicken baby

402
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:27,930
pig man with the golden sword is

403
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:31,560
probably a strength 'full as I am turtle

404
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:33,900
I would not kill baby turtle wish I have

405
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:37,020
here for no reason whatsoever I would

406
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:39,180
obviously no no no wait it's here yeah

407
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:43,980
baby turtle gets to live baby pig zombie

408
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:45,720
thing I would definitely kill squid oh

409
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:47,760
god I feel like a squid would kick my

410
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,530
ass I know that sounds weird but just

411
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,800
don't ask all right I don't like squids

412
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:56,070
bunny goes in here obviously I would

413
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,940
immobilize him one swing one Swedish

414
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:58,740
Viking swing

415
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:00,450
I would probably break his legs so he

416
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:02,310
can't jump anymore or something like

417
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:04,020
that just so he remembers not to go at

418
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:05,700
me again I don't want to have some sort

419
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:07,170
of situation I'm chilling with Myers and

420
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:09,780
then a bunny starts attacking me again

421
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:11,790
because of what I did five years ago the

422
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:13,410
likes will have to go and their men

423
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:17,040
would probably kick my ass come on they

424
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:18,029
can teleport they're scary and I don't

425
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,490
know if they would kill me though

426
00:15:18,029 --> 00:15:20,730
they're probably a teleport away

427
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:24,990
herobrine

428
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:26,730
what is this the frak is this

429
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:28,550
yeah I'll kick his ass I don't know

430
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:30,860
never seen that in

431
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:32,270
all right so there you have it folks

432
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:34,280
yeah I'm pretty pleased with this I

433
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:36,050

00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:39,350

435
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:40,910

hashtag minecraft mob fight yeah that's

439
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:49,460
it so here we have I would rather die

440
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:50,750
than to take the fight I think that's

441
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:54,230
fair that's fair

442
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:58,390
we're a prick imple that didn't grow

443
00:15:54,230 --> 00:16:00,800
more actually and that's interesting I I

444
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:02,960
would expect that to get a couple more

445
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,700
and then of course we have killed so

446
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:07,310
hard they're removed from the game

447
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:08,480
