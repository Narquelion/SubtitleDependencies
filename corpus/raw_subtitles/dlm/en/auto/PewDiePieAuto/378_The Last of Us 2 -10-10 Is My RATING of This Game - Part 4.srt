00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:15,140
I don't want to get in trouble and it's

46
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:19,970
really hard for me I hope you understand

47
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:27,620
how hard this is for me where the [ __ ]

48
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:39,260

49
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:43,549

54
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,410
at the school good

55
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:09,519

57
00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:30,640
what about her

58
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:34,480
nothing yet so the numbers are locations

59
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:36,650
the TV station we were at that's six

60
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,970
there's a lot of chatter coming out of

61
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:45,530
to so I'm assuming that's their home

62
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:49,270
base just have the baby already come on

63
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:49,270
get it over it stop complaining

64
00:04:52,169 --> 00:05:11,939
that helps how old are they supposed to

65
00:04:56,129 --> 00:05:13,919
be last night was stupid first time a

66
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:26,150
little bit of chemistry between them

67
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:29,219
I'll take no trespasser Tommy where's 14

68
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:31,639
not a hundred percent sure okay I think

69
00:05:29,219 --> 00:05:36,749
yes hmm

70
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:40,110
if this is 712 all the way over here

71
00:05:36,749 --> 00:05:42,620
I guess it's somewhere in this

72
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,620
neighborhood

73
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,830
well crest

74
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:52,440
okay I know it doesn't seem like it I'm

75
00:05:50,949 --> 00:06:00,970
really excited to play

76
00:05:52,440 --> 00:06:07,139
I'm just very tight it's hitting me you

77
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:07,139
know you know take a seat yeah not good

78
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:20,520
hey I'll go get him

79
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,520
you keep tracking them okay

80
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,370
yeah okay

81
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:33,760
wait give me your hand

82
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:42,710
it's for good luck I don't believe in

83
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,710
luck I do

84
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:50,380
it's interesting how I could be wrong I

85
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:52,120
could be completely wrong but when you

86
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:54,100
explain Locke to a lot of Japanese

87
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,510
people they don't understand it like we

88
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,250
have this thing in Sweden where you're

89
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:59,680
supposed to hold your thumbs to wish

90
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:02,260
someone luck but that's just a foreign

91
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:05,650
concept for them they would say do your

92
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:12,100
best which is such a better attitude in

93
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:15,400
my opinion gum buddy up okay instead of

94
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:17,110
just leaving it to chance please but

95
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:20,290
they must have some understanding of it

96
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:24,360
I just I don't know they usually don't

97
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:26,830
say good luck that's just not a thing oh

98
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:30,520
thank god no dianna all right that's

99
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:33,310
nice see this I would have preferred not

100
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:36,790
gonna lie someone made a really funny

101
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:38,080
comment cuz I I couldn't explain why I

102
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,580
thought it was so cringy when they

103
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,010
started calling each other babe out of

104
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:47,500
nowhere it's like they had sex after

105
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:59,200
smoking weed once hey babe it's gone

106
00:07:47,500 --> 00:08:00,460
babe yeah I feel like I read some

107
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,600
comments too and people were like why

108
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:04,750
are you playing the game too you're not

109
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:06,910
enjoying that I am enjoying it but I

110
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:09,790
also feel like I want to play it to see

111
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:16,030
if it's good or not so many different

112
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:18,130
opinions about the game I've read some

113
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:19,930
other valid comments about killing off

114
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:22,090
the main character and someone said oh

115
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:23,980
in movie sequels they always do that

116
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:25,990
they kill off the main character to make

117
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:29,590
a sequel and they did in godfather or

118
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:31,690
something like that and those are

119
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:34,930
classics I think it said something like

120
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:38,110
that but I'm like [ __ ] this isn't a

121
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:40,830
movie and we waited seven years for this

122
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:43,690
game we had there was expectations and

123
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:47,620
the whole the whole dynamic of the game

124
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:50,530
just get changed it becomes like oh I

125
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:53,640
guess that happened I hope in 10 hours

126
00:08:50,530 --> 00:09:02,880
or something it the game gets good now

127
00:08:53,640 --> 00:09:02,880
it's a bit different than a movie yeah

128
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:14,190
that's how I feel about it all right

129
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:20,190
looking around the ban on this news

130
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:22,330
you got something squirrel

131
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:25,029
should we snag the squirrel I'll leave

132
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:27,580
the chat to the sign it's not the

133
00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:32,459
squirrel yes or no hit him right between

134
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:32,459
that I've obviously not

135
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:44,020
I'm always he's not gonna do that

136
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:44,380
you [ __ ] psychopath I enjoyed the

137
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:47,760
gameplay

138
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:47,760
I'm the scenery

139
00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:59,780
still a lot these [ __ ] hold on Tommy

140
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:02,960
I was thinking about another thing can

141
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:07,130
they just have like kidnap Joel wouldn't

142
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:08,420
that have been better you think you

143
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:09,650
still done there understand they don't

144
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:11,870
want to do the same thing and then you

145
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:17,750
could have more flashback of how la Joel

146
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:19,340
teaches le different things right oh how

147
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:24,560
she got so good at fighting and stuff

148
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:29,420
those could be flashbacks then again why

149
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:30,710
would they kidnap Joe a lot of them and

150
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:33,140
then maybe they could have had it so low

151
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:36,350
you could fail so you'd want to actually

152
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:38,570
do good so you can save Joel but that

153
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:41,500
was a bad ending maybe like in heavy

154
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:44,090
rain you can mess up and the kid dies

155
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:48,470
that led to so much tension and you

156
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:50,120
wanting to succeed in the game it just

157
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:55,760
feels like all right I guess that's how

158
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:58,160
it is like the death in the in the

159
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:02,120
beginning didn't really inspire any big

160
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,980
motivation I think they'd like it you

161
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,440
see what I mean

162
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:09,650
all right we're not being critical I'm

163
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:12,370
just giving my opinion doesn't mean I

164
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:12,370
don't enjoy it

165
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:21,890
I'll just be quiet the whole time I'm

166
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:29,500
sorry you know what I'll just play the

167
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:31,760
game okay this is that the same place

168
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:35,050
see this is why uh sure just to be quiet

169
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,050
and play the game there we go

170
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:53,280

affected I'm not killing dogs oh god

00:18:15,409 --> 00:18:17,620
shot

227
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:27,359
we didn't really check in here I have to

228
00:18:25,709 --> 00:18:32,849
spend so much time looking for supplies

229
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:36,389
but I was it break down there as to

230
00:18:32,849 --> 00:18:39,229
break down there and break over here and

231
00:18:36,389 --> 00:18:41,299
a break over day and then break in there

232
00:18:39,229 --> 00:18:45,989

233
00:18:41,299 --> 00:18:50,099

234
00:18:45,989 --> 00:18:54,869

236
00:18:54,869 --> 00:18:58,229

237
00:18:56,849 --> 00:19:03,779
lot of fun having you guys here

238
00:18:58,229 --> 00:19:04,529
especially spamming [ __ ] sake I'll

239
00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:10,129
take it back

240
00:19:04,529 --> 00:19:10,129
[ __ ] off all of you stop spamming chain

241
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:24,120
it's a weird that I would have preferred

242
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:26,309
if it was just le uh I guess I can't

243
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:28,049
understand to some people the hole that

244
00:19:26,309 --> 00:19:31,020
she's lifespan is a bit I don't know

245
00:19:28,049 --> 00:19:33,419
where but maybe people didn't play the

246
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:35,400
DLC cuz it was revealed in there that

247
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:38,130
she was and it was really cute

248
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,720
actually I really like the DLC I don't

249
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:41,730
think it's that much out of nowhere I

250
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:50,190
just I'm not feeling the chemistry that

251
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:54,390
much we'd be on a yet or Dinah I think

252
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:58,530
that's what it's missing cuz it could

253
00:19:54,390 --> 00:20:01,130
have been a cool thing I'm sure he gets

254
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:05,940
more now that she's pregnant you know

255
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:20,460

oh I read another funny coming it was

275
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:36,320
something along the line like this game

276
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:41,200
feels like you're giving a kitten and

277
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:41,200
then you're told that kitten is terminal

278
00:22:44,530 --> 00:23:04,940
look it up that's what this game feels

279
00:22:47,690 --> 00:23:12,680
like hey blood here alright so we can

280
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:19,990

959
01:36:29,430 --> 01:36:32,970

it's just a recycled from uncharted

1093
01:52:13,260 --> 01:52:21,590
really without the epic climbing and Sun

1094
01:52:17,329 --> 01:52:21,590
they still filled with supplies

1095
01:52:22,730 --> 01:52:44,519
hey that a little vegetable garden okay

1096
01:52:39,860 --> 01:52:45,900
so looking for the safe code what do you

1097
01:52:44,519 --> 01:52:48,409
guys reckon we should upgrade we can

1098
01:52:45,900 --> 01:52:48,409
upgrade the

1099
01:52:54,990 --> 01:52:58,040
[Music]

1100
01:53:16,540 --> 01:53:39,910

1102
01:53:40,990 --> 01:53:44,060
[Music]

1103
01:53:44,080 --> 01:53:55,610
gotcha [ __ ] let me crash Jesus [ __ ]

1104
01:53:53,449 --> 01:54:01,880
people yeah do you have the safe code

1105
01:53:55,610 --> 01:54:08,840
anyone of you now yeah where was I

1106
01:54:01,880 --> 01:54:09,530
yes replace a grip decrease weigh draw

1107
01:54:08,840 --> 01:54:13,420
speed

1108
01:54:09,530 --> 01:54:13,420
knocking speed what's knocking

1109
01:54:24,349 --> 01:54:32,239
can't afford shy save up

1110
01:54:34,520 --> 01:54:38,030
upgrade my peepee

1111
01:54:43,380 --> 01:55:01,500
draw speed that is did anything change

1112
01:55:08,190 --> 01:55:16,450
finally some ammo for this one god edgar

1113
01:55:15,490 --> 01:55:20,680

dude your smelly dog not gonna lie

1115
01:55:20,680 --> 01:55:35,530
oh here's the code isn't it no wait this

1116
01:55:29,740 --> 01:55:41,920
is a chemistry huh interesting we get

1117
01:55:35,530 --> 01:55:46,140
more explosive I crafted arrows with

1118
01:55:41,920 --> 01:55:54,810
explosive tips oh hell yeah

1119
01:55:46,140 --> 01:55:58,150
not even doubting ass dude this as well

1120
01:55:54,810 --> 01:56:06,160
cuz then we can improve our Mali's nice

1121
01:55:58,150 --> 01:56:15,060
oh they give us a lot of pills yeah she

1122
01:56:06,160 --> 01:56:21,580
[ __ ] knowing that she saved cold yeah

1123
01:56:15,060 --> 01:56:24,100
yes I'm never gonna never know it and

1124
01:56:21,580 --> 01:56:31,240
her a real loaded gun again after that

1125
01:56:24,100 --> 01:56:35,970
Fiasco man here we go leaving the house

1126
01:56:31,240 --> 01:56:40,740
we're moving stole the others remember

1127
01:56:35,970 --> 01:56:40,740
really wish is there back of this

1128
01:56:46,640 --> 01:56:51,830
they got a lot of plasma TVs in here

1129
01:56:48,930 --> 01:56:51,830
rich gang

1130
01:56:56,100 --> 01:57:01,920
I like how they captured Ellie twice

1131
01:56:59,060 --> 01:57:03,350
they've had so many chances to kill

1132
01:57:01,920 --> 01:57:05,700
outside went in here again

1133
01:57:03,350 --> 01:57:07,860
but the first up and they know they have

1134
01:57:05,700 --> 01:57:09,330
to kill her be more careful but they

1135
01:57:07,860 --> 01:57:11,820
still let her go I don't get it

1136
01:57:09,330 --> 01:57:13,890
maybe there's a reason why reveal later

1137
01:57:11,820 --> 01:57:16,880
all right maybe the patient's safe code

1138
01:57:13,890 --> 01:57:16,880
isn't nope

1139
01:57:17,900 --> 01:57:30,420
look at the calendar okay oh of course

1140
01:57:24,900 --> 01:57:36,630
their anniversary wasn't it 8th of

1141
01:57:30,420 --> 01:57:47,480
October okay of course it wasn't even

1142
01:57:36,630 --> 01:57:50,480
far away is it 1310 8th or which order

1143
01:57:47,480 --> 01:57:50,480
wait

1144
01:57:53,560 --> 01:57:58,670
all that

1145
01:57:55,849 --> 01:58:00,849
it's ten thirteen thirteen yeah that

1146
01:57:58,670 --> 01:58:00,849
makes sense

1147
01:58:02,590 --> 01:58:11,230
no nope sorry I got confused by read me

1148
01:58:07,969 --> 01:58:14,030
you guys comment there was 113 there in

1149
01:58:11,230 --> 01:58:24,040
that was eight why the [ __ ] did you guys

1150
01:58:14,030 --> 01:58:24,040
write 13 in the comments so it's eight

1151
01:58:29,599 --> 01:58:32,599
No

1152
01:58:35,049 --> 01:58:39,059
no wait the years redundant

1153
01:58:40,650 --> 01:58:46,640
it's got to be 10 8:30 okay

1154
01:58:51,090 --> 01:58:59,370
yeah this is pointless huh

1155
01:59:05,309 --> 01:59:11,210
yes we just got to keep trying and

1156
01:59:08,460 --> 01:59:11,210
denied

1157
01:59:15,030 --> 01:59:17,840
did I do it

1158
01:59:20,429 --> 01:59:25,130
start with you did we do that I don't

1159
01:59:22,380 --> 01:59:25,130
remember what we try

1160
01:59:36,969 --> 01:59:40,320
are you guys trolling me

1161
01:59:43,239 --> 01:59:45,870
oops

1162
01:59:50,480 --> 01:59:59,020
you can do this yeah we did this [ __ ]

1163
01:59:54,100 --> 01:59:59,020
what I have we not tried I'm so tired

1164
01:59:59,620 --> 02:00:08,170
take 30 years off yeah that makes sense

1165
02:00:03,940 --> 02:00:08,170
because they said their 30th anniversary

1166
02:00:08,920 --> 02:00:19,420
its 2013 so which one do I start with in

1167
02:00:20,650 --> 02:00:34,390
[Music]

1168
02:00:27,610 --> 02:00:34,390
1982-83 not wait 73

1169
02:00:37,780 --> 02:00:45,690

02:00:41,290 --> 02:00:45,690
do let's try that

1171
02:00:49,739 --> 02:01:08,790
I want it yeah we got the revenge

1172
02:01:03,200 --> 02:01:14,190
of course it says 30th anniversary you

1173
02:01:08,790 --> 02:01:15,870
[ __ ] do the ball I'm blaming

1174
02:01:14,190 --> 02:01:16,920
everything wrong with me not getting

1175
02:01:15,870 --> 02:01:22,500
into sleep last night

1176
02:01:16,920 --> 02:01:23,969
just so we're clear okay now we got a

1177
02:01:22,500 --> 02:01:27,450
lot of stuff to play with we can make

1178
02:01:23,969 --> 02:01:33,420
explosive arrows really want to try that

1179
02:01:27,450 --> 02:01:37,830
and then we don't have that yet Christ

1180
02:01:33,420 --> 02:01:42,680
smoke bomb mmm that actually would have

1181
02:01:37,830 --> 02:01:42,680
been helpful in that mess the other time

1182
02:01:47,889 --> 02:02:10,170
I feel like explosives more fun I'll go

1183
02:01:53,199 --> 02:02:10,170
with that that's a pretty painting

1184
02:02:10,980 --> 02:02:26,290
that's a dead plane lip lip lip lip low

1185
02:02:18,969 --> 02:02:30,489
weight can also make yeah nice wait can

1186
02:02:26,290 --> 02:02:32,290
I also make no any more tape we got a

1187
02:02:30,489 --> 02:02:34,920
lot of stuff here it's gonna be a big

1188
02:02:32,290 --> 02:02:34,920
fight coming up

1189
02:02:57,269 --> 02:03:02,849
yeah I'm sorry I'm not reading super

1190
02:02:59,380 --> 02:03:04,749
chat I'm not seeing any either but I

1191
02:03:02,849 --> 02:03:08,530
don't want it to take away from the

1192
02:03:04,749 --> 02:03:20,739
gameplay but the people watching this

1193
02:03:08,530 --> 02:03:23,010

1196
02:03:28,350 --> 02:03:30,710
workout

1197
02:03:32,660 --> 02:03:53,420
like they hell yeah impossible puzzle

1198
02:03:50,970 --> 02:03:53,420

here whoa here's the hospital

1210
02:05:41,110 --> 02:05:46,540
[ __ ] me closer

1211
02:05:49,300 --> 02:05:59,440
the game is growing on me I think I

1212
02:05:57,159 --> 02:06:03,070
passed the acceptance the anger all the

1213
02:05:59,440 --> 02:06:05,940
stages of grief you know you can just

1214
02:06:03,070 --> 02:06:05,940
enjoy it for what it is

1215
02:06:08,130 --> 02:06:20,489
some man yeah it's the pen another pen

1216
02:06:21,599 --> 02:06:30,360
absolutely Wallace what's the better way

1217
02:06:26,650 --> 02:06:30,360
to go here should I jump down there

1218
02:06:33,210 --> 02:06:45,590
huh yep all right let's be careful

1219
02:06:37,590 --> 02:06:45,590
before we jump jumping through a wall

1220
02:06:48,750 --> 02:07:05,770
okay so Tyler time I need your leg day

1221
02:06:58,570 --> 02:07:08,560
[ __ ] leg day this is a problem how do

1222
02:07:05,770 --> 02:07:14,470
you guys get motivated for leg day when

1223
02:07:08,560 --> 02:07:16,540
it was really hot in UK I legit work out

1224
02:07:14,470 --> 02:07:19,210
and I own I do like day and I almost

1225
02:07:16,540 --> 02:07:21,010
faint because all the blood just goes to

1226
02:07:19,210 --> 02:07:23,920
my legs and it's so hot I'm just like

1227
02:07:21,010 --> 02:07:27,760
alright I go sleep now legit fall asleep

1228
02:07:23,920 --> 02:07:30,400
during a workout it's so bizarre it's

1229
02:07:27,760 --> 02:07:36,460
kind of comforting away it's not good

1230
02:07:30,400 --> 02:07:53,290
obviously feel like anything improve my

1231
02:07:36,460 --> 02:07:56,470
diet so this [ __ ] don't happen it's like

1232
02:07:53,290 --> 02:07:58,540
I understand why people skip leg day

1233
02:07:56,470 --> 02:08:02,440
because then it is what it is but I do

1234
02:07:58,540 --> 02:08:04,960
enjoy it too I think it would be boring

1235
02:08:02,440 --> 02:08:08,560
to just work out your Rockmore muscles

1236
02:08:04,960 --> 02:08:13,420
all the time variation makes it fun cuz

1237
02:08:08,560 --> 02:08:14,320
I don't mind I think is there because it

1238
02:08:13,420 --> 02:08:18,070
was so [ __ ] hot

1239
02:08:14,320 --> 02:08:21,480
and I had eaten like a big lunch - and

1240
02:08:18,070 --> 02:08:24,790
the blood blood goes to your digestion

1241
02:08:21,480 --> 02:08:27,750
that's right didn't attack me feel like

1242
02:08:24,790 --> 02:08:27,750
it's shotgun time here

1243
02:08:35,830 --> 02:08:53,210
I can see people liking this game if you

1244
02:08:49,970 --> 02:08:55,220
didn't play the first one there's no

1245
02:08:53,210 --> 02:08:58,520
expectations there's no disappointment

1246
02:08:55,220 --> 02:09:04,790
it just is what it is maybe that's why

1247
02:08:58,520 --> 02:09:09,140
he's getting so high rating apparently

1248
02:09:04,790 --> 02:09:12,350
IJ in Japan and IGN America rated the

1249
02:09:09,140 --> 02:09:14,150
scheme varied their friendly and japan's

1250
02:09:12,350 --> 02:09:16,640
criticism I don't know if it was real I

1251
02:09:14,150 --> 02:09:21,940
just read a translation it was so valid

1252
02:09:16,640 --> 02:09:21,940
like at least acknowledging its flaws

1253
02:09:28,670 --> 02:09:55,860
because when it shines it really shines

1254
02:09:30,930 --> 02:09:57,330
just great lacks a bit and I can't hear

1255
02:09:55,860 --> 02:09:59,460
them so they're gonna spook me I think

1256
02:09:57,330 --> 02:10:11,310
spook me spook me

1257
02:09:59,460 --> 02:10:12,000
I said spook don't cancel me these guys

1258
02:10:11,310 --> 02:10:22,380
really tough

1259
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:23,230
I assume you can't hear these guys yep

1260
02:10:22,380 --> 02:10:26,410
Thank You Ellie

semester fighter taking these guys out

1263
02:10:58,230 --> 02:11:04,330
what happens if I throw I don't want to

1264
02:11:02,710 --> 02:11:06,570
really try it but they definitely solve

1265
02:11:04,330 --> 02:11:06,570
me

1266
02:11:10,039 --> 02:11:17,239
