this series right now

12
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:26,160
our number one priority is to breed

13
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,199
our pig army and make it as strong as

14
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,720
possible

15
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,560
then what we're gonna do is we're gonna

16
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,239
make our pig army fight

17
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,960
one of the bosses of minecraft the

18
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:38,239
wither now to kill the wither you need

19
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,800
three uh skull thingies which drops in

20
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,640
the nether

21
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,160
i played yesterday on the live stream

22
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,200
and let's just cut to that footage just

23
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,840
to give you guys in summary what

24
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,160
happened i

25
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,559
enchanted my axe and was crazy lucky and

26
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,680
got a great enchantment

27
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,920
whoa damn

28
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,160
then i enchanted my sword and was even

29
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,600
more lucky

30
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:04,080
sharpness three sweeping edge three

31
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,640
fire aspects too i think that's pretty

32
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,240
good

33
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,720
that's already so good all right

34
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,320
then the wither skull which has a 5.5

35
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,439
percent chance of dropping

36
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,840
drops on the first spawns

37
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:19,119
that's pretty smart to put in a hallway

38
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,520
whoa

39
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:26,320

no oh okay he's fine he's fine how do

115
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,400
you make pants in minecraft

116
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,400
oh man it's so expensive

117
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,600
uh so as you can tell

118
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,600
it's getting very expensive to keep up

119
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,360
this beautiful diamond armor so what you

120
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,080
can do in minecraft

121
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,440
is that you can make a villager into a

122
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,759
librarian

123
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,600
but what's even better is if you cure a

124
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,680
villager and if you remember if you

125
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,240
watched series epically which of course

126
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,400
you have

127
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:56,479
this is intense yo they got villagers

128
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,479
apparently you can cure them we have one

129
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:02,240
of those we need to prepare for the

130
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,240
weather as best as we can

131
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,639
okay so to cure a villager we need one

132
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:11,199
golden apple my gosh

133
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:13,840
expensive and a potion of weakness

134
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,240
for that we need a fermented ill

135
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,680
fermented spider eye

136
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,759
brown mushroom and sugar

137
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,680
how do we make sugar you can make sugar

138
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,479
in minecraft from sugar canes okay

139
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,400
all right that makes sense hey remember

140
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,800
when i had a sugarcane farm and then i

141
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,120

142
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,759

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,280
i tried to make a spawner here but

156
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,319

157
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,960

00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,679
thanks for the help sven you're awesome

483
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:07,039
as always okay fellow zombie

484
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:08,720
so now now sven we throw splash of

485
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:12,880
weakness on him

486
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:15,919
as such i think i got it on myself as

487
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,600
well but i think it's working

488
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,400
is it working and then we're supposed to

489
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:24,640
give it the golden apple

490
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,640
whoa sven science

491
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:30,480
oh oh look at him look at him he's

492
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,480
transforming so no

493
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:34,000
[Music]

494
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,360
i'm scared sven i'm scared i'm staying

behind you

496
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:41,120
so this might take two to four minutes

497
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,880
and apparently this process gets faster

498
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:45,360
because we put him in prison

499
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:48,720
so i'm actually not that cruel as i look

500
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,720
i'm actually quite nice then

501
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:52,159

502
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,440

508
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,720

look at this one

771
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:11,119
okay we just gotta keep fishing and then

772
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:14,800
we'll eventually grow up and we'll

773
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:16,320
finally finally have

774
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,800
the helmet so we can breathe in the

775
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:21,680
water oh it's raining

776
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,720
dang it if we had the triton we could

777
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,560
transform everyone

778
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,079
right now damn it that would have been

779
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,760
so good

780
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:30,320
since it's raining we have a little roof

781
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:34,240
