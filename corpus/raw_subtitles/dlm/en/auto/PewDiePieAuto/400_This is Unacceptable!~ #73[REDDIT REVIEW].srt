better what do they got

220
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:44,160
[Laughter]

221
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:48,320
when the european settlers arrived they

222
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:50,800
needed land to live on they had no land

223
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,160
the first nation people agreed to move

224
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,680
to different

225
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:57,440
areas to make room for new settlements

226
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:05,040
how nice of them to do

227
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:08,240
so wow history is so interesting

228
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,680
i like this subreddit very nice this one

229
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,680
gets to live

230
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,240
interesting as [ __ ] all right i'll be

231
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,279
the judge of that mr i swore in title

232
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,279
cringe

233
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,720
you put you put swore in title you

234
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,320
you're immediately cringed and i don't

235
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,440
even care

236
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:26,720
all right so apparently

237
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,680
these wavy patterns of bricks uses less

238
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,839
bricks

239
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,320
because they are structurally more

240
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,800
stronger uh

241
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,399
if you do it flat you would need more

242
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,880
bricks because you need to double the

243
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,720
layer

244
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,320
that's the point of this image are you

245
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,880
