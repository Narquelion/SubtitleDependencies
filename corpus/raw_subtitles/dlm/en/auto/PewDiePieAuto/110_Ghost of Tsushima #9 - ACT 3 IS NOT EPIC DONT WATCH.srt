523
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:45,599

if you've replaced horse after horse

1201
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:16,159

1203
01:34:16,159 --> 01:34:19,840

1528
02:06:14,840 --> 02:06:17,840
quests

1529
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:24,480
i wish to do the storytelling without

1530
02:06:22,960 --> 02:06:27,360
cutscenes

1531
02:06:24,480 --> 02:06:28,480
they could have done it with that i

1532
02:06:27,360 --> 02:06:29,870
don't know if it would have been better

1533
02:06:28,480 --> 02:06:31,119
but i would have preferred it

1534
02:06:29,870 --> 02:06:32,639
[Music]

1535
02:06:31,119 --> 02:06:35,679
you tell the story through gameplay i

1536
02:06:32,639 --> 02:06:35,679
think it's so much more fun

1537
02:06:36,239 --> 02:06:40,719
you can have some cutscenes but like not

1538
02:06:38,560 --> 02:06:42,239
many

1539
02:06:40,719 --> 02:06:44,079
i've been watching you since 400k have

1540
02:06:42,239 --> 02:06:45,440
been a super lurker damn something

1541
02:06:44,079 --> 02:06:47,679
annoying and fangirling about you

1542
02:06:45,440 --> 02:06:48,560
at pax a few years back that's fine when

1543
02:06:47,679 --> 02:06:50,320
you show the pit

1544
02:06:48,560 --> 02:06:52,239
the people who's behind you in canon

1545
02:06:50,320 --> 02:06:55,520
line

1546
02:06:52,239 --> 02:06:58,079
that's cool apparently i met you uh

1547
02:06:55,520 --> 02:06:59,520
and now an exclusive section for discord

1548
02:06:58,079 --> 02:07:02,560
and the chair is in

1549
02:06:59,520 --> 02:07:04,239
backing order i'm writing wait what

1550
02:07:02,560 --> 02:07:08,239
phil i can't make sense out of that

1551
02:07:04,239 --> 02:07:08,239
message going to be completely real we

1552
02:07:10,840 --> 02:07:16,079
achieved

1553
02:07:13,360 --> 02:07:16,079
kill general

1554
02:07:17,520 --> 02:07:21,199
freeze and balls gang

1555
02:07:23,920 --> 02:07:27,040
it's the game yeah they have nature and

1556
02:07:26,320 --> 02:07:28,880
and

1557
02:07:27,040 --> 02:07:31,199
and uh open world in such cool ways it'd

1558
02:07:28,880 --> 02:07:33,440
be cooler if they just told

1559
02:07:31,199 --> 02:07:34,719
i feel like cutscenes have become a

1560
02:07:33,440 --> 02:07:37,280
replacement of

1561
02:07:34,719 --> 02:07:38,159
storytelling and it's lame it's just

1562
02:07:37,280 --> 02:07:42,480
lame

1563
02:07:38,159 --> 02:07:44,000
i don't like it it should be an addition

1564
02:07:42,480 --> 02:07:47,040
remember when cutscenes were something

1565
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:49,679
like whoa what the [ __ ]

1566
02:07:47,040 --> 02:07:51,119

1567
02:07:49,679 --> 02:07:53,119
cool

1568
02:07:51,119 --> 02:07:55,280
like diablo and warcraft and all those

1569
02:07:53,119 --> 02:07:56,239
games there's a [ __ ] cutscene you get

1570
02:07:55,280 --> 02:08:00,159
a cutscene at the end

1571
02:07:56,239 --> 02:08:00,159

1574
02:08:12,480 --> 02:08:20,159
back in my day cutscenes used to be

1575
02:08:15,760 --> 02:08:20,159
cool but now they're not cool

1576
02:08:20,840 --> 02:08:23,840

1586
02:09:27,440 --> 02:09:31,119
[Music]

1587
02:09:29,840 --> 02:09:32,400

screenshot in the middle so battle

1589
02:09:32,400 --> 02:09:35,119

try and do it on those those are cool

1591
02:09:43,920 --> 02:09:47,840

then in 10 months

1639
02:16:19,280 --> 02:16:23,840
we should have gathered 1 million for

1640
02:16:21,280 --> 02:16:33,840
charity that's the goal i want to reach

1641
02:16:23,840 --> 02:16:33,840
i think that could be so cool

1642
02:16:42,479 --> 02:16:46,639
high pitched long time fan rewatching

1643
02:16:43,920 --> 02:16:48,319

02:16:46,639 --> 02:16:49,519
[ __ ] all right give me a recommendation

1645
02:16:48,319 --> 02:16:52,800

1648
02:17:12,840 --> 02:17:29,840

your generation for the batter no i

1652
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:43,840
think about how i made it worse

1653
02:17:38,080 --> 02:17:43,840
that's what i did

1654
02:17:47,280 --> 02:17:51,200

02:24:07,280 --> 02:24:11,439
like

1741
02:24:08,160 --> 02:24:12,240

1745
02:24:18,399 --> 02:24:22,080

1746
02:24:19,840 --> 02:24:22,080
but

1747
02:24:23,439 --> 02:24:26,640
i watched some of youtube that were that

1748
02:24:24,960 --> 02:24:27,439
was like i'm not going to say that he's

1749
02:24:26,640 --> 02:24:29,040
a pedophile

1750
02:24:27,439 --> 02:24:31,040
but i'm gonna keep showing you these

1751
02:24:29,040 --> 02:24:32,640

1752
02:24:31,040 --> 02:24:35,439
as possible

1753
02:24:32,640 --> 02:24:37,760
but i won't say it so he doesn't sue me

1754
02:24:35,439 --> 02:24:37,760
of course

1755
02:24:38,319 --> 02:24:43,840

02:26:19,920 --> 02:26:22,319
everyone was trying to be edgy as [ __ ]

1780
02:26:33,680 --> 02:26:36,800
extremely inappropriate

1781
02:26:36,960 --> 02:26:40,560
and went too far but like to build this

1782
02:26:38,800 --> 02:26:42,479
case just because he made all this joke

1783
02:26:40,560 --> 02:26:44,000
to make some assumption of a label this

1784
02:26:42,479 --> 02:26:45,760
is [ __ ] up

uh cold showers lately i've been trying

1869
02:35:33,120 --> 02:35:36,640

02:35:34,960 --> 02:35:39,520
buddhists that would meditate

1871
02:35:36,640 --> 02:35:40,479
under freezing cold waterfall and they

1872
02:35:39,520 --> 02:35:42,080
would talk about how

1873
02:35:40,479 --> 02:35:44,399
horrible it was but eventually they got

1874
02:35:42,080 --> 02:35:47,040
used to it so i wanted to try and

1875
02:35:44,399 --> 02:35:49,439
get comfortable with the freezing cold

1876
02:35:47,040 --> 02:35:51,120
