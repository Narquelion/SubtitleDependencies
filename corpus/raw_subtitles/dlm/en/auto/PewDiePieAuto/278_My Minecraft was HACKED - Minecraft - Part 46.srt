space what it go away what are those

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:12,929
I don't like it back to pod alright so

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,150
now we have ton of things look how many

5
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:17,010
things we have hopefully I can make

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,880
something useful out of this I want the

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,560
proof Locker

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,150
you never know when you need it we're

9
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,930
making good progress in this game not

10
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,119
gonna lie

11
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:26,010
feel pretty good about it I want to make

12
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:28,830
a mobile vehicle BAM but I don't know

13
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:31,439
how to make it that's so unfair life

14
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,099
suck I will make myself a Spadefish and

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,850
eat it

16
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:41,670
hopefully I'll feel better yes yes so

17
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:43,260
today the goal is to oh god I don't chew

18
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,730
with my mouth open like that just so

19
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,200
we're clear disgusting

20
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,360
we're gonna build our base today and I

21
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,730
I'm trying to figure out I know I had

22
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,770
this stuff I know I have the sub I just

23
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,020
need our rebreather that's what I need

24
00:00:52,770 --> 00:01:02,280
so I need the wiring kit which I can

25
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:04,019
make yes mine mine yes hold up I need

26
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,540
one thing I need oh god it's dark I

27
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:11,220
don't want to go out when it's dark do I

28
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:13,229
wait we go we perseverance no I changed

29
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:17,759
mine it's too dark I'm scared damn I got

30
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:19,650
scared last episode okay it can wait it

31
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,650
can wait it can wait so we can make

32
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:25,409
another base somewhere is that it where

33
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:26,970
would I make the other base then cuz

34
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:28,950
look I can make another foundation now

35
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:32,159
but it wouldn't make sense to build that

36
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:34,140
at the same spot can you be quiet oh we

37
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,420
have a message Aurora

38
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,520
this is Sunday McGann we just picked up

39
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,850
a massive debris field at your location

40
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:44,030
yeah I didn't know how bad

41
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:45,439
how many of you I didn't know yeah you

42
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:47,390
didn't know now you for that one root

43
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:50,509
you're my usual baby we're sad silly boy

44
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:53,990
home something about yeah eat it [ __ ]

45
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:56,930
son be what else can I say what the only

46
00:01:53,990 --> 00:02:03,770
time I had to rig this big on a rock

47
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:07,820
that small was in VR and so are all the

48
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:11,150
others well we know you freaked up

49
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:14,209
vineya oh god my eye there's too much to

50
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:16,310
do and I can't focus on one thing we can

51
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:18,319
just make a rebreather to do that we

52
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:20,420
just need fiber mesh which is relatively

53
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:25,400
easy to get but I also really want to

54
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:27,050
build my house so I'm a bit I don't know

55
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,810
what to do I feel like it makes sense to

56
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:33,410
build a base somewhere else so I'll make

57
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:34,940
a base right where I really like there

58
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:37,340
so that seems to be a lot of materials

59
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:42,940
which I don't remember where I'll find

60
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:42,940
it don't worry gamers I'll find it I

61
00:02:44,049 --> 00:02:48,079
think it's towards the ship actually

62
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:51,620
it's a little spooky here I'm not gonna

63
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:52,160
lie it's a little spooky spooky that's

64
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:55,790
okay

65
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,330
eggs should we check for eggs on the

66
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:58,900
giant Taylor Swift

67
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:00,950
[Music]

68
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,790
when do I get a friend in this game I

69
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:04,550
feel lonely

70
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:06,290
I need my Wilson if you're not I mean

71
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:09,280
all I have is tastes way over here

72
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:17,360
alright let's check for eggs do got eggs

73
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:18,770
yeah thanks you're useless useless okay

74
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,750
so I know there's a cave here somewhere

75
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:23,960
I just don't remember it's over there so

76
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:25,610
we can build a base above it maybe that

77
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:27,860
makes sense to me at least but I I don't

78
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:29,920
have brains so I don't know help me I

79
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:32,570
guess it makes sense to have many bases

80
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,360
all your base are belong to us

81
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:37,520
epic old school reference very nice

82
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:41,120
Felix thank you okay here we build a

83
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:46,580
base are you serious I can't build a

84
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:50,080
base where do I build the frickin base

85
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:53,060
then on the ground

86
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:57,160
no can I really build base on ground

87
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:57,160
that's crazy oh my god what

88
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:08,440
I just built bass all right what's next

89
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:23,420
what do I do with this I'm not just

90
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:26,630
gonna build tubes what can i connect it

91
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:30,770
together what's the goal yeah pumps

92
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:31,490
oxygen from a powered to a pipe Network

93
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,040
okay

94
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:37,370
multi-purpose room ingredients unknown

95
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:43,250
of course cuz that's what I need really

96
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:44,440
so really I'm not ready at all Hey look

97
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:47,150

00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:51,530
lame hey don't block me don't block me I

99
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:55,700
need swims okay I'll just make the

100
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:57,590
better gas mask for now until I figure

101
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,610
out how to build in this game [ __ ]

102
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:03,350
probably should have done before I

103
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:07,190
started this god damn this game is

104
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:09,370
gorgeous what's going on over there

105
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:13,480
it's not just a cloud or something

106
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:13,480
what's going on over there what is that

107
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:20,990
so far no sharks I'm happy about that I

108
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:23,090
feel good about that don't like sharks

109
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:25,490
not a fan of it so now we can make

110
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:28,220
bing-bong bing-bong a comp ass I don't

111
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:32,410
need a comp ass I need fiber mesh oh god

112
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:32,410
I need two more I need two more

113
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:42,040
now we can make a rebreather so which

114
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:44,140
means we can dig deeper in the water we

115
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:46,330
can go deeper now that's good right

116
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:50,070
deep good right I don't know is that

117
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:52,390
better yeah yeah it's definitely better

118
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:55,570
100 percent while we're at it let's make

119
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:59,590
a compass as well actually that might be

120
00:05:55,570 --> 00:06:01,960
useful it's not as a compass work I just

121
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:03,310
oh cool it just I just have it Oh

122
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,140
awesome I should have made that sooner

123
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:06,880
so now we should be able to dig deeper

124
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:08,830
which means more materials to this means

125
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,300
more epic thank you thank you thank you

126
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:14,080
god damn it's dark though I don't like

127
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:17,070
this all I need radiation to be here so

128
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,070
I need to swap the helmets

129
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:25,240

130
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,960
I don't what happened to my radiation

131
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:30,090

00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:36,430
I dropped it by accident I dropped it

133
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:38,020
