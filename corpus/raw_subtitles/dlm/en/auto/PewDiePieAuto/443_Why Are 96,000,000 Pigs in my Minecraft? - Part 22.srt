I never know what to do with them

146
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,950

can swim around here without any problem

364
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:20,100
no Porsche is required baby you guys got

365
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:24,600
so angry oh my god you were actually

366
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:27,900
right I'm so sorry coal enchanted

367
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:31,460
fishing rod man I guess I can't move the

368
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:35,430
conduit can i ah god that sucks

369
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:37,140
it'd be so good to have that next to all

370
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:40,080
right well that's cool anyway now we

371
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:41,730
know how it works and I won't make the

372
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,430
same dumb mistakes again there's

373
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:51,060
literally a woman ocean monument next to

374
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:53,370
my spawn oh hey look people poop I made

375
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:55,670
it back as well that's awesome so

376
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:58,890
apparently mending pens is really good

377
00:21:55,670 --> 00:22:01,890
because once you get XP you heal the

378
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:04,200
pants you can heal your pants just like

379
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:09,540
I healed the peepee poo-poo with a

380
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:12,170
splash potion just like I did that thing

381
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:12,170
that I did

382
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:24,290
if you remember I am I here all right we

383
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:29,550
have the guardians of the peepee poo-poo

384
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:32,310
yeah they're so cute okay so since I

385
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:35,330
know this is kind of boring I know but I

386
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:35,330
love it so I don't care

387
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:42,180
redstone time it's time for me to

388
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:43,680
finally finalize my farm which I

389
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:46,680
actually I actually worked a lot on it

390
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:49,080
and I'm really quite happy with it the

391
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:52,230
plan was that I was gonna have a farm

392
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:54,690
that is automated just by one click of a

393
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:58,230
button and that's that has been the real

394
00:22:54,690 --> 00:23:01,830
challenge I think to make it all work

395
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:03,960
seaming Leslie yes that's a word so I'll

396
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:05,820
show you actually you know what I

397
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:08,040
haven't finished it yet so the problem

398
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:10,740
right now is that water runs down here

399
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:12,180
and it ruins all my stuff so there's

400
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:14,120
pumpkins growing here so I was gonna put

401
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:17,880
melon growing here hopefully there's

402
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:23,250
enough space can I just do this it's

403
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:26,250
gonna have to go like that one two three

404
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:30,060
okay this might be a little tight but if

405
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:32,610
it works it will be very very smacking

406
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:34,410
smacking it's a Swedish word smacking

407
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:37,440
you never heard all right it's big brain

408
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:39,420
time so I need how many Pistons yeah

409
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:42,660
eight I need eight Pistons I can never

410
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:44,940
seem to have enough Pistons I made a I

411
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:46,770
made eight okay perfect okay I really

412
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:49,710
hope this works it's gonna be truly

413
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:52,770
truly epic and I'll explain oh excuse me

414
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:54,690
the geniusness of my contractions you

415
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:56,160
know those things your mom has I need

416
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:57,300
dirt apparently I can think more than

417
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,610
one step ahead Oh

418
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:01,770
all right so we're just gonna copy this

419
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:05,120
side basically so look I made a little

420
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:05,120
window it's kind of cool

421
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,630
it is more complicated you think because

422
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,670
the water has to touch it on the under

423
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:16,040
underneath but here on the pumpkins and

424
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:17,930
melons it doesn't have to so it's it is

425
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:19,400
kind of cool I you can look at okay it's

426
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:23,650
cool I thought it was cool it was hard

427
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:26,030
and then there will go this over here

428
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:32,090
what you are for I don't know I hope

429
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:34,690
you're not important and then we'll put

430
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:40,550
this here the water will run here I

431
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:41,780
think yes fortunately I can't oh wait

432
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:42,490
maybe if I can axe it on this side

433
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:49,550
that'd be nice

434
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:52,970
ok cool haha just looking at them ok so

435
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:56,420
I need what do I need melons do I have

436
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:59,480
it because I need just a few seeds ok so

437
00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:00,950
now we're here we are gonna plant plant

438
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:04,010
the plant plant the plant plant the

439
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:07,670
plant plant plant I have water on me

440
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:13,450
perfect the water will run here that's

441
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:13,450
so good Felix no no no no

442
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:21,000
coal's I need to do that eight times

443
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:24,400
epic just drop it from here okay cool I

444
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,590
can just grab it from here my gosh I'm

445
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:31,210
so big brain that sometimes I make small

446
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:33,180
brain decisions that's a true testimony

447
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:37,660
of big brain there we go

448
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:42,640
now we plant melon melon Xiang Xiang

449
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:45,880
need edlin almost raises celery stop

450
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:50,470
rhyming Felix you are not making

451
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:54,370
anything better n okay so cool out so

452
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:56,920
they should just work so I'll just I'll

453
00:25:54,370 --> 00:26:00,280
this assume they'll work so what's

454
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:02,980
happening down here Felix let me explain

455
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:06,750
Oh God let's see if I remember how I

456
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:06,750
have to I have to pay some like this

457
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:13,510
basically when I press the button it

458
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:16,380
sends out a pulse but I need that pulse

459
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:19,240
to be a little stronger let me test this

460
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:24,670
do I not have any sticks I'll test it

461
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:26,830
with this so you see here when I remove

462
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:29,440
it it holds it a little longer

463
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:31,540
it's fades and there you go because I

464
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,550
need the water to run through I'll show

465
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:36,640
you later I need the water to properly

466
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:38,710
run through so it puts all this stuff in

467
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,630
there in the box it will all make sense

468
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:42,790
for small brains don't worry

469
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:48,340
damn the space could not have been any

470
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:52,320
more perfect what did I already put the

471
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:55,840
wiring thanks Pierce from the past and

472
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:58,000
then the hopper needs to be connect and

473
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,680
you can tell it's going in the chest

474
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,450
because the little knob is pointing

475
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:04,420
towards it just like real life

476
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:06,880
with girls that was a sexy joke okay now

477
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:11,260
the only thing remaining man I'm so

478
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:16,150
excited it's to put the water in all the

479
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:19,540
holes and just pray to God that this

480
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:24,840
works so now we have fully automated

481
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:24,840
farm watch it run through it

482
00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:32,730
you don't know how good that feels I

483
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:35,999
probably spend look it all went in here

484
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:37,350
all the melons all of them but let me

485
00:27:35,999 --> 00:27:37,679
show you how it works it's pretty

486
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:39,690
awesome

487
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,700
no one cares Felix okay we're cool I'm

488
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:43,980
gonna tell it anyway so when you press a

489
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:47,340
button it only says it sends like a

490
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:48,779
signal right that's all it does but you

491
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:50,519
can tell them to Pistons in the back

492
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:52,529
please go up right away but the Pistons

493
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:56,389
in the back water flows through longer

494
00:27:52,529 --> 00:27:58,950
so that all the taters properly go in

495
00:27:56,389 --> 00:28:02,009
some Mis it's fine it doesn't really

496
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:04,460
matter and I did that here so this is

497
00:28:02,009 --> 00:28:06,960
another this this extends to signal and

498
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:09,299
make sure the water throne runs through

499
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:12,360
longer and they'd does the exact same

500
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:15,779
thing on the pumpkins but not for the

501
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:19,190
water but for but for the Pistons

502
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:21,690
lifting it up because as you can tell if

503
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:23,249
now the Pistons are staying up waiting

504
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:25,679
for the water to run through then the

505
00:28:23,249 --> 00:28:27,269
water goes down because otherwise the

506
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:30,360
water would just run away everywhere and

507
00:28:27,269 --> 00:28:32,970
ruin my beautiful contraption piston

508
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:35,580
stays up what is done it goes down so

509
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:38,600
basically very big brain so now I can

510
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:40,799
farm all the taters to feed my army

511
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:44,309
great it looks like my camera stopped

512
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:47,850
working for some reason look at that

513
00:28:44,309 --> 00:28:54,049
beautiful and now look at all those

514
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:57,340
taters my army keep feeding my children

515
00:28:54,049 --> 00:29:01,240
that's right

516
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:05,710
