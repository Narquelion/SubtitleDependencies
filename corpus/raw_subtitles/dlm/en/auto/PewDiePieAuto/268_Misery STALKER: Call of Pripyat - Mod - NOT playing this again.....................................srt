1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,610
oh these are not good sounds I've been

2
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:12,139
meaning to play this but any time I do

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:15,089
like I want to play this game on my own

4
00:00:12,139 --> 00:00:17,850
but I keep quitting because it gets too

5
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:21,840
much for me and I can't handle it so I

6
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:27,990
thought if I record that maybe I'll be

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:34,710
okay I love the atmosphere of this and I

8
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:37,910
also hate it can Stan my god okay it's

9
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:44,969
just noise --is oh no no no no okay

10
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:48,270
