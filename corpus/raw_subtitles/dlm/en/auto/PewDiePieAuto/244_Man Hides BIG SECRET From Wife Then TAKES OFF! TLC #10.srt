[Music]

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,679

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,799

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,880
i love it so much they are so crazy

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,760
are there any sane couples in the world

8
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:30,880
apparently not apparently not

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,800
so today we're looking at mr paul

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,960
i think that's his name he's going to

11
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,000
brazil to meet the love

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,440
of his wife love of his life

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,280
english sorry i don't even speak the

14
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,640
same native language that's never going

15
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,760
to work

16
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,719
my other concern is he's already very

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,399
optimistic

18
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,840
i'm doing this but it's never going to

19
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:54,160
work queen's hometown is so remote

20
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,960
you can't drive to it the only way to

21
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,680
get there

22
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,440
is to fly into a main city and that's

23
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,280
not a big deal a river

24
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:05,040

37
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,280
a heat vest to help deal with the

38
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,119
temperature we're down there

39
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,880
it's a head wrap to help heat stroke or

40
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:44,000
heat exhaustion as you do you

41
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,000
you bring those of course

42
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,799

43
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,439
to have it and not need it than needed

44
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,439
to not have it

48
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,439
the issue of the parasitic fish

49
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,200

standard condom

53
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,680
and uh delicately secure it to myself

54
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,920
without cutting out circulation of

55
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,280
course then it would come men went to

56
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,000

okay are you a peepee swimming fish this

82
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,720
looks very promising

83
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,640
it's always a gamble with these you know

84
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,879
is that the foreigner that's gonna be

85
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,560
the psychopath or is it the

86
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,800
uh the local one that's gonna be a

87
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,720
psychopath are they both psychopaths

88
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,080
well it's the morning we'll just have to

89
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,720
wait and see you never know

90
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,519
there's many plots and turns very very

91
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,920
anxious

92
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,680
very nervous not sure what to expect my

93
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,799
anxiety level is

94
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,000
pretty high why would your anxiety be

95
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,000
level be high you're

96
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,200
you're literally prepared for every

97
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,239
single thing

98
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,840

99
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,400

100
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,400

instead of the whole episodes call me

193
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,520
i actually asked her parents permission

194
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,800
said carini

195
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:31,039
to a a hotel um to stay with me

196
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,400
but based on facial expressions this is

197
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,639
definitely not going well right about

198
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,639

199
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,840

203
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,280
speak to him she

204
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:03,759

motel wait they don't speak the same

207
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:11,039

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:13,440
types oh

209
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,800
which is ironic because i'm not looking

210
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,919
to rush in anything like that right now

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,160
and problems for me

214
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,919

i'm sorry but that's not the phase i

218
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,400
that would make me reassure that they're

219
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,560
not going to go to the hotel if

220
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,080

363
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:05,360
um she said that

364
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,399
the problem is when her parents gone

365
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:12,079
you just became a other person

366
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:14,639
and you said that she couldn't

367
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:16,000
talk to other people only romantically

368
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,639
rather than she'd talk to anybody she

369
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,839
wants to

370
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,480
i just don't want to talk to anybody

371
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,480
where it has intimacy involved that's it

372
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,680
i understand she wants to talk to her

373
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,800
family and friends

374
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,800
but when she talks to other men i mean

375
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,880
i would have a problem with that too but

376
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:34,000
i don't know what the messages were
