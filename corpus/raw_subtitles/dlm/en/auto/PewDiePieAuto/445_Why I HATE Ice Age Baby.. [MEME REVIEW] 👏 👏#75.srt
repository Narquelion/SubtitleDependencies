something does not mean I think it's

235
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:11,999
funny if anything it's the opposite just

236
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:14,279
so we're clear her

237
00:10:11,999 --> 00:10:16,319
I'm only reviewing this for the sake of

238
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:18,929
historical context and it would be

239
00:10:16,319 --> 00:10:21,359
dishonest and disingenuous for me to not

240
00:10:18,929 --> 00:10:24,419
to review the coronavirus or as I like

241
00:10:21,359 --> 00:10:24,869
to call it Corona wifeís because she's

242
00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:27,209
hot

243
00:10:24,869 --> 00:10:29,009
