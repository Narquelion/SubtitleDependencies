00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:04,440
[Music]

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:10,920
let's finally review Plato there

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:14,610
Republic why am I doing this how did I

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:16,619
go from Ukraine it's cringe for you me

5
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:21,840
to even bring it up but like I used to

6
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:25,230
scream at horror games anyway I'm new to

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,269
philosophy and I have always been told

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:30,300
that I should always start with the

9
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:33,289
Greeks and no thank you i always say i

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,289
would rather read there

11
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:41,010
but finally I picked up Plato's

12
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,260
symposium because it was fairly short

13
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:45,750
and I thought why not but I was very

14
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,430
happily surprised it was very good it

15
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,260
felt like looking through a window of

16
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,449
time where you joined the dinner table

17
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,040
of ancient Greek philosophers discussing

18
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:56,820
through the night there are thoughts on

19
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:59,339
eros their desires and it was very nice

20
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:02,460
so naturally led me to read one to read

21
00:00:59,339 --> 00:01:04,680
the Republic which is arguably Plato's

22
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,590
greatest work if not one of the greatest

23
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,229
political western philosophies of all

24
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:12,119
time what a title everyone and again I

25
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:13,830
was very happily surprised how much I

26
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:16,020
enjoyed it for those who don't know it's

27
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,820
a it's a dialectic it's a dialogue

28
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,250
between two people or a couple people

29
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:23,130
with different views and somehow coming

30
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:25,770
to some form of conclusion and I find

31
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:29,039
this style of writing to be so much more

32
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:30,840
engaging and immersing seem like I

33
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:32,550
described with the symposium Plato's

34
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,610
writing is about coming to a conclusion

35
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:37,020
together and Plato himself

36
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:39,119
self-admittedly doesn't have all the

37
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,369
answers that's why I picked this book

38
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,349
because I think it could be interesting

39
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:45,209
to discuss because of all of these

40
00:01:43,349 --> 00:01:47,910
things that I just said how do I make

41
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:51,239
videos sorry this will be a very long

42
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:53,759
video but that's strap on and put on

43
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:55,619
your vlog seatbelts and let's freakin do

44
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,629
this please keep watching I need the

45
00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:00,420
watch time just put put on the video in

46
00:01:57,629 --> 00:02:02,550
the background I don't care just keep we

47
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:05,580
have some couple important notes before

48
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:07,830
we begin Plato the Republic is a very

49
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:10,050
controversial piece of literature it

50
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:14,069
challenges fundamental ideas not just

51
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:17,760
around society but also how we review

52
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:19,950
our own lives in ways that might feel a

53
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,959
bit uncomfortable it probably should

54
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:24,870
make you feel uncomfortable and I think

55
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:26,849
that's a lot of times the point as a way

56
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,590
to challenge ideas I don't know if

57
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:31,019
that's true or not I just threw that in

58
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:34,709
there but most importantly I just want

59
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:37,230
to say here early on big disclaimer I do

60
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:40,560
not agree with every single idea that

61
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:43,630
this author has a necessary 20:19

62
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,780
disclosure everyone

63
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:48,820
I think most people wouldn't agree with

64
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:51,730
all the ideas of Plato and Plato himself

65
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:55,600
doesn't agree with all his ideas so we

66
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:58,510
get later on he'll disc criticize his

67
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:01,570
own thoughts basically I am NOT an

68
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:05,410
expert I am not pretending that I know

69
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:08,230
everything about this I will just give

70
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:12,070
my own summary and thoughts around the

71
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:15,430
different topics discussed and I highly

72
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:19,780
encourage you to do your own study and

73
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:23,730
research to fully get that proper grasp

74
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:26,710
of this book this is going great

75
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:28,930
first of all I think it's important to

76
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:31,360
understand why this book was written to

77
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:34,090
fully understand where the ideas came

78
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,640
from to properly critique something you

79
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:38,140
you need more than just the ideas you

80
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:42,490
need to understand where the ideas come

81
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:45,160
from and a lot of the more crazy ideas

82
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:48,070
of Plato that a republic will make a lot

83
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:50,560
more sense with these things in mind I

84
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:55,060
think at least so some quick background

85
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:56,460
basically Plato lived in 428 did I get

86
00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:01,780
that right that's right

87
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:04,000
428 BC in Athens Greek in Greece Greece

88
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,470
Athens and the ancient Greek as I'm sure

89
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,290
a lot of you are already familiar with

90
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:11,320
defined a lot of our Western

91
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:14,640
civilization babe had massive leaps in

92
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:18,430
not just philosophy but our literature

93
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,270
biology architecture politics and much

94
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:22,450
much more

95
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:25,000
all this while simultaneously fighting

96
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:28,030
two wars the Persian War and the

97
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,700
Peloponnesian War this has relevance we

98
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:34,240
will get there I promise just keep the

99
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:37,870
video going in the background so during

100
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:40,240
the Persian War where the Greeks were

101
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:41,980
vastly outnumbered I always imagined

102
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,950
like the movie 300 even though that's

103
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:46,990
clearly not what happened at all but the

104
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:49,000
Greeks were vastly outnumbered but the

105
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:50,560
way they defeat the Persians was from

106
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,140
coming together all the different

107
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,330
city-states of greece came together

108
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:57,760
ancient greece back then was

109
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:59,320
very different from how we know brief is

110
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,670
it Greek or Greece it's really annoying

111
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,470
me how I don't know this it was very

112
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:05,580
different from what it is today it's

113
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:07,780
been north and I think even across Italy

114
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:10,300
all these different areas I don't know

115
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:12,400
exactly the their Geographics okay but

116
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:14,710
it was bigger okay and the old estates

117
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,500
came together and just be like no Persia

118
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:19,180
go away and they did it but after this

119
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,950
word after defeating the Persians

120
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:24,010
instead of all the states coming

121
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:25,930
together they broke apart and they

122
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:28,060
fought against each other in a civil war

123
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:29,860
known as the Peloponnesian War where

124
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:33,270
they fought against who should be the

125
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:35,650
ruler of the city-states it was a very

126
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:38,380
it was a very brutal war which you can

127
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:43,030
tell just from how long it lasted 27

128
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:45,100
years and eventually Athens lost play to

129
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:48,250
live who lived during this time he saw

130
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:51,550
the effects of this war he people close

131
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:52,930
to him that passed away and I think and

132
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:57,600
I think keeping this in mind is

133
00:05:52,930 --> 00:06:00,100
important for some of the more crazy

134
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,740
ideas that are proposed in the Republic

135
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:04,900
because Plato wanted to avoid civil war

136
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:07,680
at all cost and I think keeping that in

137
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:10,030
mind is important to have an open eye

138
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,630
open mind for the discussion

139
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:16,210
the second reason I think is because

140
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:18,760
Athens at this time was a democracy and

141
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:20,500
that was something that the Athenians

142
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:23,050
were very proud of it's something that

143
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:25,060
was part of their character that they

144
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,650
had that they lived in a democracy and

145
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:33,790
it was something that they greatly

146
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:36,580
upheld but in 399 BC 399 so Cortez I'll

147
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:38,980
never forget that number so Curtis the

148
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:41,620
philosopher was executed under this

149
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:44,860
democracy and I think this is something

150
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:47,740
that really affected Plato and also

151
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:49,240
shaped ideas for the Republic so the

152
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:52,390
Peloponnesian War and the fact that

153
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,380
Socrates was executed I don't know if

154
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:56,320
this is correct

155
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:58,840
I'm just saying okay so then what was

156
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,980
Plato's and Socrates relationship we

157
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,940
haven't even started with the book

158
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:04,300
review yet Felix

159
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:07,300
this is just an essay at this point I

160
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:11,630
just think it's necessary to establish

161
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:13,550
early on why their relationship I didn't

162
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:15,320
really know it I mean I think most

163
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:18,020
people have heard of so Curtis

164
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:21,350
maybe not of Plato or vice versa I don't

165
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:23,660
know but so cthis was a philosopher he

166
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:26,420
is a historical figure that that did

167
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:29,120
exist the thing is that he never wrote

168
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:31,970
down any of his work and it was Plato

169
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,580
who basically did this but Plato writes

170
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:37,130
his work in the Republic as a dialogue

171
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:40,760
where Socrates is the main character and

172
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:42,860
obviously we can't know for sure to what

173
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,990
level of accuracy the dialogue actually

174
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:49,130
occurred most likely it wasn't that

175
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:50,840
accurate but again we don't know but it

176
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:53,540
is a little bit confusing because Plato

177
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:55,520
is the author and but Socrates is the

178
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:58,100
main character who presents all these

179
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,390
ideas some compare Socrates and played

180
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:01,760
this relationship as a sort of

181
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:03,620
teacher-student relationship which is

182
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:06,590
inaccurate because so Kurt has never

183
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:10,790
taught he'd spoken people listened but

184
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:13,310
it also kind of fits the picture as well

185
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:16,910
I like to see it as a senpai and kohai

186
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:19,340
kind of relationship so then what is the

187
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:22,330
Republic about you might ask how long

188
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:25,340
have I recorded Oh God

189
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:27,650
well Socrates is famously not interested

190
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:30,560
in finding relative solutions he wants

191
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:32,000
to find absolute truths if we don't know

192
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,250
what something is then how can we

193
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,169
properly understand it and so curtis is

194
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:38,840
famous for trapping his opponents with

195
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:41,180
his what is it question to give it give

196
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:43,610
a definition of something and the

197
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:46,280
Republic begins with such a question

198
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:49,220
such a what is it question in Brooke one

199
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:51,830
the novel begins with Socrates he is

200
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:54,590
walking home from a religious festival

201
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:56,900
and he stumbles into some acquaintances

202
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:59,150
who convinced him to come over to their

203
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:01,880
place he sort of half reluctantly

204
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:04,100
accepts there's a couple of people in

205
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:06,830
this group but let's focus on cephalus

206
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:09,080
first syphilis is an older man and the

207
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:11,560
dialogue begins with this what is it

208
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:15,279
question coming from a soccer test who

209
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:16,840
as cephalus what's it like to be so old

210
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,240
this could be seen as a very rude

211
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:22,029
question to ask someone but Socrates

212
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:24,430
once to spark a conversation not about

213
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:26,560
making people feel good

214
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:30,310
despite the very rude question cephalus

215
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:34,029
responds in a composed manner of saying

216
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:36,010
that well I enjoy being old I no longer

217
00:09:34,029 --> 00:09:39,040
feel controlled by arrows my desires

218
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:41,260
doesn't control him anymore he looked

219
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,820
forward to being rewarded in his next

220
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:45,850
life because he's lived an honest life

221
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:48,910
and lived up to his legal dues so he

222
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:51,610
thinks well I may be old I may be dying

223
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:55,960
soon but I still will be rewarded in the

224
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:58,060
next life and Socrates goes godom you

225
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:01,060
just gave me a definition of justice

226
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:03,940
living in an honest life and living up

227
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:06,400
to your legal dues that's the definition

228
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:08,040
of justice that you just gave me even

229
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,900
though that's not my question

230
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:12,700
and then to stomp over settle his

231
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:16,420
argument that he never even

232
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:18,490
intentionally made Socrates challenges

233
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:21,370
cephalus view England further and says

234
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:24,610
well if justice is living up to your

235
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:26,560
legal dues then let's say for example I

236
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:29,110
don't know if this is not the example he

237
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,730
brings but let's say you borrow an axe

238
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:33,100
from a friend because you need to chop

239
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:35,589
some wood and then later on your friend

240
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:37,990
demands to have the axe back but the

241
00:10:35,589 --> 00:10:40,230
friend has gone completely insane

242
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:43,510
would you still give the axe back to him

243
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:45,700
obviously not you you wouldn't give a

244
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:48,130
weapon to a crazy person so in that's

245
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:52,870
regard no justice is not living up to

246
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:54,670
your legal obligations and you are just

247
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:58,180
wrong in this argument that you never

248
00:10:54,670 --> 00:11:00,010
even made cephalus who's old is not

249
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:02,410
interested in this conversation and he

250
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:05,230
bids his farewell and leaves the group

251
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:06,940
but there are some younger remaining

252
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:10,060
people in the group who has been

253
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:11,950
listening and they give their opinion on

254
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:15,820
instead one of them being Chris amicus

255
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:20,410
who is a sawfish Sophists were teachers

256
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:22,900
I think back in ancient Greek where they

257
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:27,100
would be hired by rich people to teach

258
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:29,170
their sons they are the enemy of Plato

259
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:31,120
and Socrates you can say because they

260
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:33,460
are not interested in finding absolute

261
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:36,100
truth and they're just more interested

262
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:39,730
in winning an argument basically and go

263
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:43,360
into whatever stretched to do so

264
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:45,400
so there's images this office says gives

265
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,280
his definition of justice and says

266
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:50,050
justice is the advantage of the stronger

267
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:53,470
he admits that this is not really a

268
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:56,530
definition but he's saying that it pays

269
00:11:53,470 --> 00:12:00,070
off more to be unjust than to be just

270
00:11:56,530 --> 00:12:02,650
and people who are are unjust naturally

271
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:05,980
progress in society and justice is a

272
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:08,650
restraint put on us stopping our natural

273
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:11,470
desires to progress Socrates then

274
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:13,990
responds by saying well if justice is in

275
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:16,630
the advantage of the stronger do people

276
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:19,950
make mistakes and through simcha says

277
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:25,270
yes people make mistakes and then

278
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:27,820
Socrates asked well-to-do rulers make

279
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:30,250
mistakes and of course recent mexico

280
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:33,520
says yes rulers can make mistakes and

281
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:34,840
then he finishes by saying well I don't

282
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:38,020
remember if this is the exact example

283
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:42,670
but let's say for example if you are a

284
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:44,830
ruler and you put up a tax policy that

285
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:47,470
will benefit you you will get more money

286
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:50,200
from the people and you'll raise the

287
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:52,570
taxes but the ruler is doing what they

288
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:55,240
think is just because they have the

289
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:58,270
advantage and they gain from this but

290
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:01,030
let's say then that this new tax policy

291
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:05,410
basically bleeds the city dry there's no

292
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:07,720
more money left and eventually it will

293
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:09,550
end up hurting the ruler because he's

294
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,630
left with less than what he had from the

295
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:12,190
beginning and you know

296
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:15,130
longer acquire anything from its

297
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:17,680
citizens therefore justice is not in

298
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:20,710
fact in the advantage of the stronger

299
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:24,120
because rulers makes mistakes through

300
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:29,110
Simic has response then by saying well I

301
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:31,630
need to win this argument justice is

302
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:34,420
what the ruler thinks is in the

303
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:37,330
advantage of the stronger and very

304
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:39,100
interestingly their Simba cos sort of

305
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:43,300
just disappears from the book at this

306
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:45,700
point he could very well still be part

307
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:48,430
of the group and listening silently but

308
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:50,740
it's not worthy how he disappears at

309
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:54,900
this point because he brings up the

310
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:57,730
subject he brings up the the relative

311
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:59,890
argument and so Curtis just isn't

312
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:02,470
interesting interested in it that's not

313
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:04,240
the reason of this dialogue he wants to

314
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:07,360
find the ultimate troop of what is

315
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:10,240
justice Socrates has now defeated his

316
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,070
opponents more or less but the rest of

317
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,020
the group is not entirely satisfied

318
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:15,700
golovkin who is another member of the

319
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:19,780
party wants a better definition of

320
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:22,420
justice is just life superior to an

321
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:25,120
unjust life it's a question that they

322
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:26,230
ask and they want Socrates to prove it

323
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,450
and maybe you were thinking while

324
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:30,040
finding the definition of justice that's

325
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:33,490
really not that interesting at least

326
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:35,320
first when I heard about it I wasn't

327
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:39,040
completely engaged but when you think

328
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:40,630
about it and a broad broad sense it it

329
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,570
really shapes everything in our lives

330
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:46,930
what is good and what is bad what is

331
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:50,110
right and wrong is being it's being just

332
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:51,850
better than being unjust why should you

333
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:55,020
live an unjust life instead of an unjust

334
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:58,570
life I think it's a very interesting

335
00:14:55,020 --> 00:15:01,120
topic that I've never asked myself

336
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:02,590
before and gakuen brings up a very

337
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:07,450
interesting example

338
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:10,750
kokom says that justice is social bond a

339
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:13,600
contract between people which I think

340
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:15,610
can make sense he expressed as much like

341
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,740
her Simic has said that we have a

342
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:20,200
natural desire to wanting to gain more

343
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:22,910
and the only reason we don't act unjust

344
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:24,920
is because we don't want unjust things

345
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:27,230
happened to ourselves and if the whole

346
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:29,210
world acted unjust then everyone would

347
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:31,580
just stand to lose from it so therefore

348
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:35,210
it's a social contract his view of

349
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:36,890
Justice so therefore in his view justice

350
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:39,050
comes from weakness and it comes from

351
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:42,920
fear and he brings up this example of

352
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:44,290
the ring of guy G's which is a magical

353
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:47,600
ring so he brings up this thought

354
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:49,150
example of if you had a ring that could

355
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:54,140
render you invisible

356
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:56,300
would you still act just I think I've

357
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:58,430
played around with this idea and maybe

358
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:00,710
you have as well where if you had

359
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:03,200
something where if you could do

360
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,890
something unjust and no one would know

361
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,380
about it

362
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:08,870
would you do it and Glaucon argues that

363
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:11,900
anyone with this ring even the most just

364
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:13,520
person would still act unjust because if

365
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,710
you're invisible no one will know about

366
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:17,690
it you could rot rob a bank or you could

367
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:19,220
I don't know and do all kinds of things

368
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:22,360
I'm not gonna bring up their example

369
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:24,830
whenever people ask me what my

370
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:27,560
superpower ability would be I always

371
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:30,110
thought okay well what superpower could

372
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:33,530
I get that would benefit me the most and

373
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:35,750
not face any consequences so I think

374
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:38,300
this definition fits in pretty well and

375
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:42,020
I think it fits in with actually what a

376
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:44,270
lot of people look at justice it's a

377
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:47,450
pretty I think a common common way to

378
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:48,710
look at it but we may maybe we've never

379
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:50,420
actually thought about it

380
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:51,950
Edda man just join us into the

381
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:55,220
conversation as well with who is

382
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:58,370
glaucon's brother I think and he says

383
00:16:55,220 --> 00:17:01,250
that justice itself isn't desirable and

384
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:03,710
that we only act just because we want to

385
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:06,260
be rewarded in the afterlife

386
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:09,170
so therefore element is in Vulcan want

387
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:12,170
Socrates to prove to them that justice

388
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:14,150
in itself is desirable and that living a

389
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:17,300
just life is better than living in a

390
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:18,860
unjust life and Socrates warns Adam

391
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:21,650
enticing glaucon that this is gonna be a

392
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:23,180
very long journey to get through and I

393
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:25,160
will warn you in case you made it this

394
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:29,720
far in this video that yes in fact it

395
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:31,460
will be very long video but they are up

396
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,500
for the task they're young and they're

397
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:36,039
excited and they

398
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:38,470
they want to find the answer I also

399
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:42,039
think it's interesting how Socrates

400
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:44,650
purposely wanted to hear everyone else's

401
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:46,419
argument at this point he hasn't really

402
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:48,520
expressed his own views he's literally

403
00:17:46,419 --> 00:17:50,559
he's actually just picked apart what

404
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:54,429
other people's ideas are but this is

405
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:57,010
really where the book begins all of its

406
00:17:54,429 --> 00:18:01,840
own topic to find the definition of

407
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:04,330
justice and the way Plato or Socrates

408
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:07,090
does this I think it's very surprising

409
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:10,120
and very interesting to prove that

410
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:12,880
justice is superior he brings up the

411
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:14,980
analogy of the human in a macro

412
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,380
perspective of a city it's called the

413
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:20,080
city Sol analogy and basically it means

414
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:23,650
that to prove that a just city is

415
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:25,840
happier than an unjust City the same

416
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:28,539
analogy can be drawn between a just man

417
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,730
and an unjust man what a just man is

418
00:18:28,539 --> 00:18:33,100
happier than an unjust person and so

419
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:36,280
begins the very long journey of the

420
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:38,500
Republic I will brush through some

421
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:41,049
points just to save time and I also

422
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:43,270
still don't understand all of it to be

423
00:18:41,049 --> 00:18:46,659
honest I guess I'm just too old

424
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:49,419
so to craft this society so curtis says

425
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:51,669
that each person in this city must

426
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:55,390
specialized to maximize the efficiency

427
00:18:51,669 --> 00:18:58,090
of the city he wants a shoemaker to

428
00:18:55,390 --> 00:19:00,040
focus solely on making shoes a doctor to

429
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:03,700
solely focus on

430
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:06,400
doing doctor things and that a shoemaker

431
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:08,020
who specializes will always be better

432
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,820
than a shoemaker that doesn't specialize

433
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:12,580
and the shoemaker will always be better

434
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:14,470
at making shoes then a doctor can make

435
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:17,200
shoes and a doctor will always be a

436
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:18,940
better doctor than a shoemaker ok I

437
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,810
think you understand what I mean so this

438
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:25,600
city will initially just start off with

439
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:28,150
farmers craftsmen doctors the city will

440
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,280
live with just what is necessary and and

441
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:33,190
won't go beyond that and Socrates calls

442
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:35,440
that this city is healthy because of

443
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:37,390
this but how come however has a very

444
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:40,120
different view on it he says that this

445
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:42,520
is he calls it a city of pigs ironically

446
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:44,500
he thinks that people have a natural

447
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:46,870
desire for more people have a natural

448
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:51,370
desire for luxury better entertainment

449
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:55,200
better food so he argues that they will

450
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:58,000
want to eat meat in this city which is a

451
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,280
seemingly small distinction from what

452
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,980
the city previously has been but it

453
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:05,200
makes all the difference because to have

454
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:07,240
meat in the city you need more land and

455
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:10,870
to have more land you need to go to war

456
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:12,760
and therefore they both agree that this

457
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:14,440
is a natural progression Glaucon and

458
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:17,860
socrates agrees this is a natural

459
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:20,650
progression and that war is inevitable

460
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:23,170
in this city and therefore a new class

461
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:25,780
of people is introduced in the Republic

462
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:28,330
which is the Warriors by socrates idea

463
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:30,160
of specialization warriors can only be

464
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:33,070
warriors and nothing else and he

465
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:35,650
describes his highly spirited individual

466
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:37,360
and these highly spirited individuals

467
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:39,700
make for great warriors but they are

468
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,530
hard to control you want to be able to

469
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:43,990
control them so they don't become thugs

470
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:46,300
and break the laws but you also don't

471
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:48,120
want them to become too wimpy as well so

472
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:50,800
Socrates proposes that the best way to

473
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:52,840
contain these warriors is through

474
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:55,870
education so it's important that these

475
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:58,720
warriors are educated to act on the will

476
00:20:55,870 --> 00:21:01,620
of the city how do we do that well so

477
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:04,420
Curtis explains what stories will be

478
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:05,950
available in this city and what stories

479
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:08,020
won't be available I think more

480
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:11,890
importantly he says that the classic

481
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:12,350
legends of Homer will be forbidden or

482
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:14,390
send

483
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:18,950
third in the city because the stories in

484
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:20,919
Homer and other works show that dying as

485
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:24,169
something really bad and that's not

486
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:26,470
beneficial for the city Warriors needs

487
00:21:24,169 --> 00:21:29,990
to be able to die for their state and

488
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:32,960
therefore they cannot allow that these

489
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:35,000
work of fiction to be shaping the souls

490
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,799
of the Warriors so Christine goes

491
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,220
through in great detail what will be

492
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:42,860
allowed not just in literature but also

493
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:47,210
music what kind of instrument and even

494
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:48,799
what type of notes will be allowed or at

495
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:51,260
least what will be the most effective

496
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:55,130
you can look at it the same way of the

497
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:58,100
type of music that is played in in

498
00:21:55,130 --> 00:22:01,250
military it's very similar with the

499
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:03,679
drums and then the type of tunes but

500
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:06,409
this all falls under a very interesting

501
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:08,450
topic of censorship it's something that

502
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:11,960
we've all been affected by ever since

503
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:14,450
growing up our parents censor certain

504
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:16,490
things from us when we are children and

505
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:19,010
they do this for a good cause they do it

506
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:23,299
to protect us and I would argue that so

507
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:25,370
Curtis sees the city and its people in

508
00:22:23,299 --> 00:22:27,230
the same way where the city would be a

509
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:29,570
mother censoring certain things for

510
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:33,080
their child censorship is a topic that

511
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:35,929
is still widely discussed even today I

512
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:39,500
think there's three points that can be

513
00:22:35,929 --> 00:22:43,190
brought up against censorship I mean III

514
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:45,200
myself has been highly affected by it I

515
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:46,820
would would even say I think the number

516
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,770
one point against censorship is that

517
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:51,860
there's a natural curiosity towards

518
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:53,900
things that aren't allowed I think most

519
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:55,309
people can relate to wanting to do

520
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:58,490
something more because they weren't

521
00:22:55,309 --> 00:23:01,669
allowed to do it and and the desire to

522
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:03,740
wanted to do it Eve being even stronger

523
00:23:01,669 --> 00:23:06,020
because of it another example could be

524
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:10,070
if a parent for example lies to their

525
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:13,010
child let's say a parent a mother might

526
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:14,870
be a such a bad example if a mother is a

527
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:17,210
stripper and maybe they don't want their

528
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:19,309
child to go through go through the same

529
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:21,380
career path then they might lie about

530
00:23:19,309 --> 00:23:21,810
what their job is before they go to work

531
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:24,540
it

532
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:28,530
they might say I'm going to I don't know

533
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:29,700
the bank instead to protect their child

534
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:30,990
they do this to protect their child

535
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:33,360
because they don't want them to follow

536
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:35,520
the same path but eventually let's say a

537
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,860
couple of years down the line the child

538
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,930
finds out the truth and this sort of

539
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:42,150
trust between a mother and a child has

540
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:46,080
been broken because of their censorship

541
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:49,170
and maybe the damage would have been the

542
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:51,240
damage of that is much more than what

543
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:53,640
would have been if the parent had just

544
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:57,060
said the truth a lot of times you could

545
00:23:53,640 --> 00:24:00,060
argue it's the negative effect of what's

546
00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:03,240
being censored really more than what is

547
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:06,750
positive just video games really cause

548
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:11,520
violence and I think by censorship you

549
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:14,730
are in playing that you know better you

550
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:17,610
know for a fact that this needs to be

551
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:19,980
censored because I know it has a

552
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:22,740
negative effect and I think that's a lot

553
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:24,090
of times is said without much evidence I

554
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:26,670
think it's a really interesting topic

555
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:28,800
some people are arguing that censorship

556
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:33,660
is good some people arguing that it's

557
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:36,360
always bad and here we are

558
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:39,870
2000 year later still discussing it

559
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:42,570
there's also many examples of in history

560
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:44,040
of progression of humanity being held

561
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:47,760
back because of censorship

562
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:50,820
we had Galileo a famous example must be

563
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:52,530
getting tired at this point whose

564
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:55,110
famously his ideas were censored because

565
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:56,640
he challenged the Christian view what's

566
00:24:55,110 --> 00:25:00,860
your right what's your opinion of

567
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:03,480
censorship are you still with me hello

568
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:05,580
the next topic of the Republic is

569
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:08,070
another controversial idea in this city

570
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:11,010
that Socrates describes there will be

571
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:14,520
doctors of course but these doctors will

572
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:16,500
not treat anyone if you get wounded in

573
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:19,100
battle of course the doctor will treat

574
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:21,480
you but any form of self-inflicted

575
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:23,850
injury

576
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:26,010
will not be taken care of let's say if

577
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:29,010
you injure yourself from eating or

578
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:31,410
drinking too much as an example sorry

579
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:33,420
that time and resources will not be

580
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:36,180
wasted on you which kind of makes sense

581
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:39,000
a little bit but then it gets a little

582
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:41,820
darker so Curtis would probably argue

583
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:45,720
for a euthanasia if you have a chronic

584
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:48,560
illness you are then just costing this

585
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:51,990
city a bunch of money and resources and

586
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:54,690
therefore you will be thanked for your

587
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:55,470
service in the city but you will also be

588
00:25:54,690 --> 00:26:00,270
pissed

589
00:25:55,470 --> 00:26:01,950
I think obviously now we have a very

590
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:06,360
different view of life and I'm not

591
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:08,430
saying I agree with it we obviously we

592
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,720
know a lot more than we did back then we

593
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:11,610
don't have the same view of the

594
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,320
afterlife as well but I think what's

595
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:16,220
interesting here is the distinction

596
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:20,310
between a good and a bad like a

597
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:22,770
fundamental belief from when we're

598
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:24,840
grown-up is that everyone is born equal

599
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:26,880
and we have the same should be we should

600
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:30,030
all be treated equally and I agree with

601
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:32,910
that of course but I think we're I think

602
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:35,040
it's interesting is if the distinction

603
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:37,800
between a good and a bad life and I

604
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:40,650
think we treat all life as good when

605
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:43,020
that's not necessarily the case I hope

606
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:44,700
that isn't taken in a weird way by

607
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:46,010
anyone all right let's move on this is

608
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:49,110
too controversial

609
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:54,600
the third controversial idea three in a

610
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:57,380
row is the the myth of metals which is

611
00:26:54,600 --> 00:27:00,390
another idea proposed by Socrates and he

612
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:03,240
explains this in the almost embarrassed

613
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:05,700
manner he knows how ridiculous this

614
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:08,580
sounds is metal metals but basically

615
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:11,130
it's a lie told by the city to its

616
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:13,830
citizens that they don't have any mother

617
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:17,400
or father and that they came from the

618
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:19,740
earth that's right and I I think the

619
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:21,990
purpose of this is pretty obvious it's

620
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:24,630
so that you would look at this state as

621
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:26,860
your parent and Socrates finds is very

622
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:30,850
useful for the sake of

623
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:32,860
hey patriotic view of the state and and

624
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:35,350
loyalty to the state and there's similar

625
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:37,630
ideas around housing people should live

626
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:39,909
together in this common areas instead of

627
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:43,929
and private households will not be

628
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:45,940
allowed by anyone even its rulers so

629
00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:48,669
there's some pretty crazy ideas being

630
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:53,620
proposed here it's like Plato created

631
00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:56,590
communism not Karl Marx but perhaps the

632
00:27:53,620 --> 00:28:00,909
silliest bit out of the myth of metals

633
00:27:56,590 --> 00:28:03,580
which is that everyone is born not just

634
00:28:00,909 --> 00:28:05,470
from the earth but into different

635
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:07,480
categories so you will be born either

636
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:10,419
there into bronze silver or gold

637
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:13,120
category and depending on that which

638
00:28:10,419 --> 00:28:14,830
will determine what sort of job and what

639
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,289
group in

640
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:19,000
society you fit into and now at this

641
00:28:17,289 --> 00:28:21,850
point you might think well this sounds

642
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,409
pretty awful I don't want to live in

643
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:26,230
this city and neither should anyone and

644
00:28:23,409 --> 00:28:28,990
I think you're right to assume that the

645
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:31,419
whole concept of this city is not with

646
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:33,730
the mindset of the well-being of certain

647
00:28:31,419 --> 00:28:35,710
individuals it's it's the mindset of the

648
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:37,470
well-being of the whole state and I

649
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:40,809
think it's pretty interesting how

650
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:43,269
completely opposite our ideas around

651
00:28:40,809 --> 00:28:44,919
individuality is today and there's

652
00:28:43,269 --> 00:28:47,320
obviously good cause for that and good

653
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:51,700
reason for that but I think there's

654
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:54,460
examples of today of individual focus

655
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:57,279
that almost seem comical there's a lot

656
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:59,919
of famous dystopian x' written around

657
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:02,980
this sort of ideas I think we have

658
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:07,000
dystopian novels such as 1984 brave new

659
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:08,740
world we buy as a mutant who may have

660
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,889
inspired all of these and these were

661
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:14,049
authors who lived to see the effect of

662
00:29:11,889 --> 00:29:16,240
communism and to tell it to tell it

663
00:29:14,049 --> 00:29:18,220
arianism and probably written as a

664
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:21,309
reaction to that we have brave new world

665
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:23,590
which really fits into the Socratic idea

666
00:29:21,309 --> 00:29:26,649
of the myth of metals where all the

667
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:28,210
people in this novel are born from tests

668
00:29:26,649 --> 00:29:30,809
and labs they don't have a mother or

669
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:33,850
father they they they are born in this

670
00:29:30,809 --> 00:29:35,740
Factory and you they also fit into these

671
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:38,000
groups as well they are born into this

672
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:39,890
different ranked groups in society and

673
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,630
everyone is happy with being part of

674
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:44,000
their own group Big Brother of course

675
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:46,370
also with the idea of the state being

676
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,870
this family figure almost I don't know

677
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:51,800
if that really fits but you understand

678
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:54,230
my point we we attend where there is no

679
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:57,410
individualism you are born as a number

680
00:29:54,230 --> 00:30:01,150
and as the name implies itself it's oh

681
00:29:57,410 --> 00:30:03,950
it's all about the group and not your

682
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:05,990
your own well-being basically according

683
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:08,210
to Socrates there will be no money in

684
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:11,330
this city which is a very interesting

685
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:13,250
topic in itself as well I Dementors he

686
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:15,110
loves goals he sees is that something

687
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:17,300
preposterous and he says that if there's

688
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:19,610
no gold then people won't the city won't

689
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:21,650
be able to defend itself because no one

690
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:23,720
will come to its aid if they can't pay

691
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:25,460
them but Socrates claims that any

692
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:27,740
neighbouring city will happily come to

693
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:29,780
its aid because they have obviously the

694
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:32,690
best warriors I've completely skipped a

695
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:34,310
part about how they grow how they train

696
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:36,230
their warriors it's very interesting but

697
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:38,390
since they have the best warriors that

698
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:40,400
doesn't care about money there will be

699
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:42,080
everything left after the battle to

700
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:44,000
plunder for themselves

701
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:47,060
since this city does not permit it I

702
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:50,270
think Socrates recognizes that money is

703
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:52,700
not necessarily a good but it's also not

704
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:54,830
necessarily something bad here we go

705
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:56,390
again with boohoo millionaire complaints

706
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:59,540
about money that's not the case I think

707
00:30:56,390 --> 00:31:01,850
I view it in a very similar way I think

708
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:04,790
money is good if you spend it well but

709
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:07,340
it's not as if I have a pile of money at

710
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:09,770
home that I worship and that that in

711
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:13,220
itself brings me joy when you have money

712
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:15,230
you worry about losing money and saying

713
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:17,210
you can take for example anyone at the

714
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:19,490
stock market it seems like a very

715
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:21,110
stressful profession and I think a lot

716
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:23,150
of people have the view that if only

717
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:25,520
they had money then then they would be

718
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:27,590
happy but there's so many examples of

719
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:30,830
people winning the lottery and then

720
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:33,500
turning up more unhappy than they used

721
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:35,720
to be because their whole worldview has

722
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:37,190
changed in their whole whole life have

723
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:39,240
changed because of month I think there's

724
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:41,770
even a

725
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:43,510
science and that data behind this now

726
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:46,380
showing that after a certain point of

727
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:50,880
money you you don't become more happy

728
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:53,890
because probably implies more troubles

729
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:55,840
which I can agree with more money no

730
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:58,450
problem he said it the best

731
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:00,760
or was it biggie yeah another

732
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:05,830
interesting topic around this as well as

733
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:08,470
its expansionism where socrata says this

734
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:10,990
city will not expand beyond a certain

735
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:14,200
point because by limiting the size of

736
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:16,900
this city they can make sure that it can

737
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:18,910
maintain its ruling there's so many

738
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:21,690
examples of in history of we had

739
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:24,280
Napoleon the the constant expanding

740
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:25,840
eventually leading to its demise and I

741
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:27,970
think the same thing ties in with gold

742
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,500
as well when you have when you have it

743
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:31,270
you just want more and more of it

744
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:34,300
eventually leading to your own

745
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:41,320
destruction Here I am making videos

746
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:44,140
why now we're on book five everyone

747
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:46,809
I haven't mentioned this but basically

748
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:48,540
there's ten books of that Republic but

749
00:32:46,809 --> 00:32:52,450
they can sort of be seen as chapters

750
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:53,290
instead and it gets even more strange at

751
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:54,929
this point

752
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:59,440
Socrates brings up the topic of

753
00:32:54,929 --> 00:33:01,540
selective procreation where another

754
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:04,720
great light that will be told by the

755
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:06,309
state which is that everyone's partner

756
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:09,850
will be determined through a lottery

757
00:33:06,309 --> 00:33:12,850
state lottery where basically your

758
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:14,920
sexual partner it's completely by chance

759
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:18,429
or so they are will be told of course

760
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:22,809
the state will instead put together the

761
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:26,080
most desirable or admirer below that

762
00:33:22,809 --> 00:33:28,000
they want more of in this city to breed

763
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:30,429
the best kind of people in the city and

764
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,890
also avoid any form of incest because

765
00:33:30,429 --> 00:33:34,570
obviously people don't know who their

766
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:37,090
real mothers and fathers are so it's

767
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:40,090
also necessary for that sense I think

768
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:43,330
they follow the same storyline in we

769
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:45,730
said yet and savvy Athens we

770
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:48,460
where everyone has their set partner in

771
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:50,619
this dystopia I think it's interesting

772
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:53,950
how they bring up this topic for nearly

773
00:33:50,619 --> 00:33:58,960
2000 years ago of genetics and and their

774
00:33:53,950 --> 00:34:02,049
and reproducing we're getting to a point

775
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:04,539
where we'll in the future most likely be

776
00:34:02,049 --> 00:34:08,799
able to I think I read in an in another

777
00:34:04,539 --> 00:34:10,929
book where people I think it was Stephen

778
00:34:08,799 --> 00:34:14,559
Hawking actually he pointed out how

779
00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:17,049
people with will eventually manipulate

780
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:20,500
the DNA so that this superior people

781
00:34:17,049 --> 00:34:22,629
will come into existence we can we can

782
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:25,270
change DNA in a way that we can craft

783
00:34:22,629 --> 00:34:27,339
certain individuals for certain purposes

784
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:29,470
and Socrates was playing with the idea

785
00:34:27,339 --> 00:34:31,659
even 2,000 years ago I think that's

786
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:33,879
interesting in book five as well we get

787
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:37,089
to hear a little bit of Plato's ideas

788
00:34:33,879 --> 00:34:37,839
around feminism which is not the best

789
00:34:37,089 --> 00:34:40,299
way to put it

790
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:42,399
I don't think I think most people don't

791
00:34:40,299 --> 00:34:47,200
think that Socrates or Plato had any

792
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:49,599
sort of ideas we have today but he

793
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:52,629
recognizes that men and women are

794
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:55,809
different by nature but in terms of

795
00:34:52,629 --> 00:34:57,700
ruling who can be a ruler he sees no

796
00:34:55,809 --> 00:34:59,920
difference between a man and a woman and

797
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:02,890
that they they are both fit for the role

798
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:06,700
I think even now most people aren't too

799
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:08,680
used to women being in a leadership but

800
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:10,680
again 2,000 years ago Socrates

801
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:13,089
recognized that there is no difference

802
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:15,250
which can be seen as a sort of

803
00:35:13,089 --> 00:35:18,220
progressive thought to put forward

804
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:20,230
especially with the mind of how poorly

805
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:22,510
women were treated back in ancient Greek

806
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:24,369
I think they all they had to do was stay

807
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:26,170
at home all day taking care of the house

808
00:35:24,369 --> 00:35:28,839
and they were generally treated poorly

809
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:31,710
as far as I know but then again you

810
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:37,260
could also just see it as recognizing

811
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:41,380
that women can get what men already have

812
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:44,660
so so who then are the most fit to rule

813
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:47,690
this city I'll let you get

814
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:49,340
that's right philosophers I gotta say

815
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:51,970
soccer today they're a little bit of an

816
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:55,220
elitist it really feels like

817
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:57,230
so since philosophers they seek truth

818
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:59,390
above all else and therefore their

819
00:35:57,230 --> 00:36:01,970
rationale and their rational part of the

820
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:03,950
soul will ruled the city and best ruled

821
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:06,290
the city so Socrates has a very

822
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:08,120
interesting view of leadership which in

823
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:11,030
a way I agree with but it's also

824
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:13,250
extremely pessimistic he says that if

825
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:18,020
you look at how we determine a leader in

826
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:20,480
democracy it is a very long process to

827
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:23,480
go through with anyone that wants to

828
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:25,310
become a leader is up for a tremendous

829
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:28,430
task of going through a public election

830
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:30,920
it's not something that anyone is

831
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:32,570
willing to go through with to become a

832
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:34,910
leader in our democracy

833
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:38,960
you must truly want to become a leader

834
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:41,750
and Socrates argues that the one most

835
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:43,730
fitted to rule is the one that wants to

836
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:47,210
rule the least and he brings up this

837
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:50,120
example of a boat where a couple of

838
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:51,650
seamen or a couple of seafarers are on

839
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:54,830
this boat they're travelling to this

840
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:57,350
destination but everyone is arguing over

841
00:36:54,830 --> 00:37:00,470
who should steer the ship was the one

842
00:36:57,350 --> 00:37:02,360
who is most fit to steer the ship is the

843
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:04,150
one focusing on the Stars and they're

844
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:06,800
looking at the Stars to try and navigate

845
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:09,740
instead which is what they should be

846
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:12,350
doing so the person most fit to steer

847
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:13,790
the ship is the one focusing on what

848
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:17,120
they need to do to steer the ship

849
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:19,340
instead of arguing why they should steer

850
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:20,690
the ship I explained this very poorly

851
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:22,820
but I think you understand the point

852
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:24,590
therefore according to Socrates the one

853
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:26,630
who wants to rule the least isn't the

854
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:29,210
most appropriate to rule but they will

855
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:31,520
also never become the ruler because they

856
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:33,740
don't seek it and this is pessimistic in

857
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:36,590
the sense that it implies that the ship

858
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:38,660
cannot make it to the shore even if

859
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:40,750
people are arguing which is obviously

860
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:43,730
not the case next up we get into

861
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:47,630
metaphysics which I find a little hard

862
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:50,290
to understand still and therefore I will

863
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:53,140
try in my best

864
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:56,050
I do understand the allegory of the cave

865
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:58,780
and I think that's the probably the best

866
00:37:56,050 --> 00:38:01,120
way to introduce the idea of the the

867
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:01,510
idea of the good as Socrates describes

868
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:04,050
it

869
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:06,910
Socrates recognizes the world as

870
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:10,470
something that can be described beyond

871
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:13,420
our senses he uses math as an example

872
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:15,610
2+2 will always be for no matter where

873
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:17,710
you are in the universe when certain

874
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:19,780
things according to our eyes and our

875
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:23,560
vision in our senses will appear

876
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:28,480
differently depending on our subjective

877
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:31,090
manners colors is something it's a color

878
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,540
red red for everyone you understand what

879
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:34,570
I mean

880
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:39,150
but 2+2 will always be for Socrates

881
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:42,730
brings up here in book 7 the most famous

882
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:45,640
metaphor in philosophy or Western

883
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:47,470
philosophy at least I talked about this

884
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:49,540
before on in my video and you might have

885
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:50,710
heard it already which is the famous

886
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:52,480
allegory of the cave

887
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:54,400
it's something that I discussed in my

888
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,890
simulacra and simulation video and I

889
00:38:54,400 --> 00:39:00,120
used it in the context of simulation

890
00:38:56,890 --> 00:39:02,440
which funny enough still applies but

891
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:05,350
Socrates brings up the allegory of the

892
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:08,740
cave as a way to describe education I

893
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:11,560
want you to try and imagine a very dark

894
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:15,400
cave and in this cave there are a couple

895
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:17,890
people in a row and these people are

896
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:19,840
completely immobilized they cannot move

897
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:22,060
any inch of their body that cannot move

898
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:25,150
their head imagine clockwork orange'

899
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:27,130
style strapped down to this in this cave

900
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:30,580
with chains the only thing these people

901
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:32,440
can see is the cave wall in front of

902
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:34,390
them now this wall has a bunch of

903
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:37,630
shadows cast upon them because there is

904
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:39,510
a light behind them and in front of this

905
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:42,940
light there are people crossing a bridge

906
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:45,550
so what the prisoners in the chains can

907
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:47,620
see on the wall are just shadows all

908
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:48,790
these people moving back and forth and

909
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:50,890
since these people have never

910
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:53,950
experienced anything else in their life

911
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:55,690
for them and what their senses are

912
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:57,430
telling them is that these shadows are

913
00:39:55,690 --> 00:40:00,100
real because they don't know any other

914
00:39:57,430 --> 00:40:01,990
truth so eventually in this allegory of

915
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:03,309
the cave one of the prisoners managed to

916
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:06,099
escape his chain

917
00:40:03,309 --> 00:40:09,969
and his worldview is of course then

918
00:40:06,099 --> 00:40:12,479
completely changed he sees people that

919
00:40:09,969 --> 00:40:15,309
are real he sees a whole new dimension

920
00:40:12,479 --> 00:40:17,469
essentially and so Kurtis describes this

921
00:40:15,309 --> 00:40:19,179
experience as very painful something

922
00:40:17,469 --> 00:40:22,779
very painful to go through but

923
00:40:19,179 --> 00:40:24,999
eventually a satisfying experience but

924
00:40:22,779 --> 00:40:26,949
he isn't the prisoner isn't completely

925
00:40:24,999 --> 00:40:30,459
free yet and he managed to escape the

926
00:40:26,949 --> 00:40:32,499
cave in itself where he eventually gets

927
00:40:30,459 --> 00:40:36,369
blinded by the Sun again a very painful

928
00:40:32,499 --> 00:40:39,309
experience but once it's calmed down he

929
00:40:36,369 --> 00:40:41,319
sees he recognizes the Sun the light

930
00:40:39,309 --> 00:40:43,259
brings all things into existence he sees

931
00:40:41,319 --> 00:40:45,519
the flowers he sees the trees and

932
00:40:43,259 --> 00:40:48,939
there's this beautiful image you can see

933
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:53,549
its character embrace praising the Sun

934
00:40:48,939 --> 00:40:56,799
basically and this is the soccer this

935
00:40:53,549 --> 00:41:02,919
metaphor for the idea of the good the

936
00:40:56,799 --> 00:41:04,749
Sun bringing that the true forms see I'm

937
00:41:02,919 --> 00:41:06,819
not really good at explaining it but

938
00:41:04,749 --> 00:41:09,309
this the Sun represent the form of good

939
00:41:06,819 --> 00:41:11,679
basically and the point of Education is

940
00:41:09,309 --> 00:41:14,049
to drag a person out of this cave to see

941
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:16,390
things how they actually really are and

942
00:41:14,049 --> 00:41:18,909
not just feeding information to you

943
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:21,699
not everyone can escape this cave and

944
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:23,709
therefore Socrates thinks that the

945
00:41:21,699 --> 00:41:25,809
person who escaped the cave needs to

946
00:41:23,709 --> 00:41:28,419
come back that philosopher-king needs to

947
00:41:25,809 --> 00:41:30,819
come back from the cave to rule in book

948
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:33,069
eight Socrates steps back from

949
00:41:30,819 --> 00:41:35,709
describing the the Republic of the city

950
00:41:33,069 --> 00:41:38,589
and he instead takes some time to

951
00:41:35,709 --> 00:41:43,079
describe different forms of regimes he

952
00:41:38,589 --> 00:41:45,849
describes a democracy a an oligarchy

953
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:47,650
democracy and finally a tyranny and I

954
00:41:45,849 --> 00:41:49,209
will kind of brush over this because I

955
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:51,459
don't know it that well and I kind of

956
00:41:49,209 --> 00:41:53,890
want to say any form of time I have at

957
00:41:51,459 --> 00:41:56,529
this point but I think what's important

958
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:58,569
here is how he notes that each one of

959
00:41:56,529 --> 00:42:01,269
these different rulings are are worse

960
00:41:58,569 --> 00:42:04,509
than the other and that in the last

961
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:07,839
stage which is when democracy the most

962
00:42:04,509 --> 00:42:11,409
free form of city that there is will

963
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:14,739
eventually fall into tyranny that most

964
00:42:11,409 --> 00:42:16,570
limited the least free city Socrates

965
00:42:14,739 --> 00:42:19,510
says that the desire

966
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:22,180
or freedom will eventually lead to not

967
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:24,370
having proper rulers it will give the

968
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:26,170
chance for a tyrant to rise and I think

969
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:30,520
it's very very interesting how

970
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:32,590
accurately truckers test depicts the the

971
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:34,630
rise of the tyrant two thousand years

972
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:35,860
ago more than two thousand years ago he

973
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:37,480
accurately depicts something that has

974
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:39,010
already happened to as many times you

975
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:41,590
have the example of Saddam Hussein

976
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:44,380
Hussein who our last known tyrant who

977
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:46,630
rose to power through democracy I think

978
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:49,780
and he started off by doing a lot of

979
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:52,720
good for its people much like other

980
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:55,120
tyrants of our time Benito Mussolini for

981
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,570
example who famously made the trains run

982
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:58,480
on time

983
00:42:55,570 --> 00:43:01,360
Saddam helped modernize infrastructure

984
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:04,840
he helped modernize industries health

985
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:07,750
care system education different social

986
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:11,740
services farming same with Hitler but I

987
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:13,780
will not bring up any examples because I

988
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:16,060
don't want to be taken out of context I

989
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:18,460
think you get the point the tyrant

990
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:19,660
starts from a democracy and and does

991
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:22,660
good for its people

992
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:26,050
but as Socrates describes the tyrant who

993
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:28,510
is ruled by its desires will eventually

994
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:31,450
get the taste of blood it will do

995
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:33,490
something to an opposition he will

996
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:36,700
execute one of its enemies and he will

997
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:39,970
do this in the name of the people he

998
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:43,480
will do it as I've done something to

999
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:45,760
protect you not me and once he had the

1000
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:48,580
taste of blood that will just be the

1001
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:51,040
start of it the tyrant who is ruled by

1002
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:53,740
his lust and desires will not just bleed

1003
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:58,030
the city dry but will become paranoid

1004
00:43:53,740 --> 00:44:00,340
and kill all their enemies this loss of

1005
00:43:58,030 --> 00:44:03,010
blood will continue only the people that

1006
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:05,860
flatter the tyrant will will keep living

1007
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:08,560
and anyone challenged in his position

1008
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:11,800
will of course be executed and this is

1009
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:13,870
what happened to Saddam assign a lot of

1010
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:16,840
in the end of his regime his military

1011
00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:19,870
power was very poor because he had

1012
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:22,120
executed anyone and most of his best men

1013
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:24,970
just out of sheer paranoia Socrates

1014
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:27,890
argues that the least happy man in the

1015
00:44:24,970 --> 00:44:29,869
world is this ruling tyrant

1016
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:31,640
which actually starts to make a lot of

1017
00:44:29,869 --> 00:44:35,420
sense if you think about it constantly

1018
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:38,089
living in this fear this paranoia driven

1019
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:39,079
by your your greed and lust you can't

1020
00:44:38,089 --> 00:44:41,539
trust your friends

1021
00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:44,150
constant fear of enemies Saddam even

1022
00:44:41,539 --> 00:44:47,390
himself had to move where he lived every

1023
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:49,460
single day to protect himself so not

1024
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:53,660
only is the ruling tyrant the least

1025
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:56,239
happy it's also the worst worse ruling

1026
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:58,309
for a city for example Iraq used to be

1027
00:44:56,239 --> 00:45:00,200
so much richer before before the time

1028
00:44:58,309 --> 00:45:02,569
was saddam hussein and socrates draws

1029
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:04,519
the the opposite line that the just man

1030
00:45:02,569 --> 00:45:06,680
is the happiest man and the unjust man

1031
00:45:04,519 --> 00:45:09,200
is the least happy man so then who is

1032
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:11,329
the most happy man well of course you

1033
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:13,579
could probably guess that's right the

1034
00:45:11,329 --> 00:45:16,789
philosopher everyone is anyone surprised

1035
00:45:13,579 --> 00:45:20,299
again such an elitist according to

1036
00:45:16,789 --> 00:45:22,759
Socrates the one seeking truth is the

1037
00:45:20,299 --> 00:45:24,799
greatest pleasure of them all and only a

1038
00:45:22,759 --> 00:45:27,410
philosopher will know this because he's

1039
00:45:24,799 --> 00:45:29,450
experienced all the pleasures it even

1040
00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:33,049
makes a really strange joke about it

1041
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:36,499
saying that the philosopher king is 729

1042
00:45:33,049 --> 00:45:39,440
times more happier than the ruling

1043
00:45:36,499 --> 00:45:42,319
tyrant which obviously it's a joke

1044
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:43,579
you cannot quantify such a thing I think

1045
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:45,829
there's a reason behind the number I

1046
00:45:43,579 --> 00:45:47,660
just don't remember it let me know in

1047
00:45:45,829 --> 00:45:50,089
the comments Socrates also draws a

1048
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:52,489
conclusion between the three parts of

1049
00:45:50,089 --> 00:45:55,039
the city at the three classes and the

1050
00:45:52,489 --> 00:45:56,440
three parts of the soul I cannot get

1051
00:45:55,039 --> 00:45:59,690
into it I'm sorry

1052
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:02,269
I just remember it didn't really made

1053
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:05,180
sense to me the idea of the soul from

1054
00:46:02,269 --> 00:46:07,789
Socrates but finally we made it to the

1055
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:10,789
end book ten where Socrates brings up

1056
00:46:07,789 --> 00:46:13,880
the view of the afterlife he talks about

1057
00:46:10,789 --> 00:46:16,579
the myth of error which is a warrior who

1058
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:19,430
died in battle and he then goes to the

1059
00:46:16,579 --> 00:46:23,089
afterlife with has a bunch of people in

1060
00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:25,279
it kind of like an airport and he sees

1061
00:46:23,089 --> 00:46:27,410
how the system works and basically

1062
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:29,390
people will have to serve a thousand

1063
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:31,099
years in heaven or a thousand years in

1064
00:46:29,390 --> 00:46:33,079
hell based on how you lived your life

1065
00:46:31,099 --> 00:46:35,480
that this is where you go but after

1066
00:46:33,079 --> 00:46:37,640
serving this thousand years you will

1067
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:40,190
then get to pick a new life again and

1068
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:41,480
here again according to Socrates only

1069
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:44,119
this philosopher

1070
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:46,460
know how to pick the right life I think

1071
00:46:44,119 --> 00:46:48,170
it's very interesting because just like

1072
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:51,350
this natural progression of different

1073
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:52,820
type of ruling so will the person the

1074
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:54,250
individual go through the natural

1075
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:56,480
progression between good and evil

1076
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:58,250
themselves they will not always make the

1077
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,080
right decision of what life they want to

1078
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:03,109
live and only the philosopher knows

1079
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:05,630
which life is the right choice and in

1080
00:47:03,109 --> 00:47:06,980
the story he will have to pick last I

1081
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:09,830
don't know if Ava's error that had to

1082
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:12,680
pick but the character of this myth has

1083
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:16,369
to pick last between what life they can

1084
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:17,990
live and he finds the life eventually

1085
00:47:16,369 --> 00:47:19,310
their life of what philosopher and he

1086
00:47:17,990 --> 00:47:22,400
says this is the life I would have

1087
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:23,810
chosen even if I got to pick first and

1088
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:27,140
he was not very happy with this decision

1089
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:29,180
he picks this life of a philosopher an

1090
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:33,920
ordinary man who Minds his own business

1091
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:37,190
and that is the definition of justice

1092
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:39,500
according to Socrates or Plato minding

1093
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:41,960
your own business and not meddling with

1094
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:45,020
other men's concerns I think I kind of

1095
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:47,570
brushed over the end of how it all ties

1096
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:50,359
in together with the individual and the

1097
00:47:47,570 --> 00:47:50,900
city but I think this has gone on well

1098
00:47:50,359 --> 00:47:53,780
enough

1099
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:56,180
I think Plato's Republic is such a

1100
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:58,790
phenomenal piece of literature it makes

1101
00:47:56,180 --> 00:48:00,590
me happy that I'm alive to even

1102
00:47:58,790 --> 00:48:02,690
experience it just from the sake of

1103
00:48:00,590 --> 00:48:05,450
taking part of these ideas that were

1104
00:48:02,690 --> 00:48:08,510
written so long ago I don't know what

1105
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:10,400
else there exists anything like this the

1106
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:12,920
life of Socrates is so interesting as

1107
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:15,440
well and it continues in his other books

1108
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:16,640
as well again this is why I'm so happy I

1109
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:18,920
picked up literature because I think

1110
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:21,440
it's so interesting to take part of

1111
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:24,470
these discussion and ideas and and

1112
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:27,680
stories whether you know it's real or

1113
00:48:24,470 --> 00:48:29,960
not I find it very very fascinating to

1114
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:31,550
escape into I don't know what other

1115
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:34,310
medium could possibly accomplish

1116
00:48:31,550 --> 00:48:35,770
something like this and I think Republic

1117
00:48:34,310 --> 00:48:38,840
is such a great example of that

1118
00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:42,380
it discusses ideas that are still very

1119
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:45,140
much relevant today in a way that is

1120
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:47,600
still very engaging and exciting and I

1121
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:49,070
love reading this book I don't think I

1122
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:50,720
would have taken so much time with it

1123
00:48:49,070 --> 00:48:52,940
otherwise and if you made it this far

1124
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,190
thank you for watching it it wasn't

1125
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:56,230
really much of a review

1126
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:58,750
I got to bring up some of my thoughts

1127
00:48:56,230 --> 00:49:00,700
around it I would obviously give it 10

1128
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:03,339
out of 10 I'll announce the next book

1129
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:05,650
review in as always on Twitter or the

1130
00:49:03,339 --> 00:49:07,200
reddit and keep an eye for that I would

1131
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:10,000
love to hear your thoughts and

1132
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:12,280
discussion of the comments section or on

1133
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,880
the reddit I'll see you guys there

1134
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:14,880
good bye
