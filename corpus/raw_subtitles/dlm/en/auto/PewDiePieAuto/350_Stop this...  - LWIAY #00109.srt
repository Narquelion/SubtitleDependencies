it all right back to your dramatic memes

83
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,979
whiskey theme you know why because

84
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,459
you're not allowed to drink y'all

85
00:04:16,979 --> 00:04:22,009
nineteen-year-old laughs in European

86
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:25,530
laughs in Swedish hey hey

87
00:04:22,009 --> 00:04:30,240
most of the Mars scenes in the Martian

88
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:32,849
2015 were actually filmed on earth this

89
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,780
is what it drains the soul of cinema

90
00:04:32,849 --> 00:04:39,419
every time they use suggests using CGI

91
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:41,400
instead of actual props and actual

92
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:44,610
settings it's upsetting when you're

93
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:46,979
there yep when your mom chooses your new

94
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:48,930
haircut the irony here is that my mom

95
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:51,240
never let me cut my hair short she

96
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:53,340
wanted me to have it long which is good

97
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,000
on my mom because I look way better with

98
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,580
long hair

99
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,409
clearly I just never had it short so I

100
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:01,169
thought I kind of want to just see how

101
00:04:58,409 --> 00:05:04,139
it looks like and surprisingly hairline

102
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:06,539
is fine I didn't notice so now I know

103
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:09,030
this this is good and if you notice here

104
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:12,300
as well even better it's the fact that

105
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:16,560
my forehead is huge which basically

106
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:18,990
means my brain is large how did that

trampoline I always wanted a trampoline

146
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,040
friends are like a trampoline you have

147
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,480
to go to someone else to enjoy it

148
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,100
because there was always that one friend

149
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,750
that had a trampoline there was always

150
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:29,310
that one friend that was way more

151
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:32,370
popular than everyone else

152
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:34,020
only because they had a trampoline let

153
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:36,180
me just say it straight out so it's

154
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:38,160
crystal clear for everyone if you had a

155
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:40,320
trampoline the only reason you had a

156
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,240
friend is because you are the trampoline

157
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,650
owner people don't want to be around you

158
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,260
people just want to jump on your

159
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:48,440
trampoline and yes the trampoline is a

160
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:50,630
metaphor for your balls

161
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,850

268
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:40,040

270
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:49,100

00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:57,410
no wonder he's 180 centimeter god this

275
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,600

276
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:02,269
alright I'll explain this I can explain

277
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:05,209
this hold on so you think this is the

278
00:13:02,269 --> 00:13:08,209
soul but really the way the foot goes is

279
00:13:05,209 --> 00:13:10,970
is like this it goes all the way until

280
00:13:08,209 --> 00:13:13,160
the bottom there's no soul that's how my

281
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:14,750
feet look like on the inside so it looks

282
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,579
it looks like I just don't want other

283
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:18,110
people to feel bad that are short that's

284
00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:21,920
why just so we clear

285
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:24,230
hey oh that's nice thank you I like his

286
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,699
new look yeah I think now it's a little

287
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:27,079
too short I think if I grow it out a

288
00:13:25,699 --> 00:13:28,579
little bit it'll look it'll look better

289
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:30,500
they look better it's okay

290
00:13:28,579 --> 00:13:31,610
appearance isn't everything this is

291
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,769
something that people judge you by

292
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:35,500
someone made a CD with all my hit

293
00:13:33,769 --> 00:13:38,329
singles I really appreciate the

294
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:40,160
placement of that that's great breaking

295
00:13:38,329 --> 00:13:42,380
news if you call the police I will come

296
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,360
I will have to say out of all bad things

297
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:46,009
happening in the world one thing I

298
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:48,350
appreciate is that if I'm really bored

299
00:13:46,009 --> 00:13:50,029
in a line somewhere it is kind of funny

300
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:52,610
just to call for the sake of it

301
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:54,110
just to see people's reaction I was at

302
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:56,000
the post office and I had nothing to do

303
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:58,970
there's taken forever and you just just

304
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,790
do that's all you have to do and all the

305
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:04,310
sudden really if you cut down a tree you

306
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:04,970
must plant two more even musk three take

307
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:07,459

308
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:09,590
oh he did three so I already said that

309
00:14:07,459 --> 00:14:12,110

being epic that's awesome I like how I

311
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:15,410
actually take credit for that they're

312
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:18,380
saying stuff and then there's action to

313
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:20,000
take an action oh I'm so good thoughts
