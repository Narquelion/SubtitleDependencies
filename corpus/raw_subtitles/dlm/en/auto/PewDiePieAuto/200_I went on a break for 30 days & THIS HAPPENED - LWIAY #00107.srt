the break when you close your eyes I

77
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:16,799
don't know why I never thought of this

78
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:19,110
your eyes are still there okay

79
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:21,060

80
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:22,680
your head or something you're still

81
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:25,560
looking even with your eyes is closed

82
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,150
you're always looking even when you're

83
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,850
asleep you're looking what's on your

84
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:33,269

00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:40,350
don't need to see the face of the people

88
00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:41,790
on security cameras though this is

89
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:44,610
understandable this is actually the

90
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:46,410

00:10:22,209 --> 00:10:27,100
hello guys I broke my mind a lot

241
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:28,809
everyone has come back to this video

242
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,429
just to check if cutie pie come back yet

243
00:10:28,809 --> 00:10:33,550
technically I won't have to come back

244
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:35,800
like I could probably retire if I wanted

245
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:38,259
to so it was good for me to take a break

246
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,579
to sort of process what I'm doing and

247
00:10:38,259 --> 00:10:41,410
what I want what I want to do in the

248
00:10:39,579 --> 00:10:42,670
future and there's definitely some

249
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:44,559
changes I will have to do with the

250
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:46,149
channel I think but I'll I'll do them

251
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:48,220
gradually and I don't want to just like

252
00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:50,050
say okay now we're doing this I just

253
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:52,509
think I've been obsessing too much about

254
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:54,019
YouTube and just like pushing myself way

255
00:10:52,509 --> 00:10:55,970
too hard for too long when it's

256
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:57,800
like all right well there's other stuff

257
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:59,449
I want to do as well and I'm working on

258
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,369
some bigger project as well which I

259
00:10:59,449 --> 00:11:04,160
don't want to limit myself to just doing

260
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:05,749
daily just for the sake of it although I

261
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,999
have been missing it a lot

262
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:09,439
it's funny I actually thought I wouldn't

263
00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:11,779
be able to go on a break I thought oh

264
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:13,549
maybe I'm so addicted to YouTube that I

265
00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:15,649
will just be crawling on the walls and

266
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:18,170
be like oh god I need to turns out no I

267
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:19,850
I'm not sure decide it was completely

268
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:21,589
fine to be fair I was in Japan it was

269
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:23,360
easy to distract myself but at the same

270
00:11:21,589 --> 00:11:25,339
time yeah that was definitely days where

271
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,899
I'm like huh it made me appreciate the

272
00:11:25,339 --> 00:11:29,299
fact that I have an audience I kind of

273
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:31,759
just taken that for granted in a way I'm

274
00:11:29,299 --> 00:11:33,860
sorry and I think I've only seen all the

275
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:35,869
negative parts of having an audience

276
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,220
just because my following became so big

277
00:11:35,869 --> 00:11:40,369
that I just got really tired of

278
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:41,869
constantly and asked being asked for

279
00:11:40,369 --> 00:11:43,759
stuff on the PM from people in the

280
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:46,339
street and all that but surprisingly I

281
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:48,319
got a lot of a lot of secret words that

282
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:49,879
recognized me that was really nice for

283
00:11:48,319 --> 00:11:51,499
those who don't know we have a secret

284
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:53,749
word now in case you meet me you have to

285
00:11:51,499 --> 00:11:56,660
say the secret phrase I think almost

286
00:11:53,749 --> 00:11:59,540
half people said it so that make made me

287
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:01,579
feel good day 36 Pierce is still gone I

288
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:03,499
