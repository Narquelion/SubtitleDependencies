00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:47,800
thing on Google Streetview this dog

good boy

161
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:56,759
meanwhile in Russia Google Streetview

162
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:03,159
what is happening here does anyone look

163
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:05,589
at it looking to like ah they got it

164
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:08,499

165
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:10,360
there's also the I don't know what this

166
00:08:08,499 --> 00:08:12,669
is I don't know what's happening here

167
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,559
but I can only imagine but they're

168
00:08:12,669 --> 00:08:16,959
fighting us oh my god

169
00:08:14,559 --> 00:08:19,269
they even convicted a man in Taiwan

170
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:21,969
thanks to Google Maps because an

171
00:08:19,269 --> 00:08:24,519
Unleashed dog was responsible for a

172
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:27,129
neighbor's bicycle accident this is

173
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:29,079
Christ Google Mass will get you man big

174
00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:33,879
brother is watching you but I think the

175
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:37,990
most the worst one is when he is falling

176
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:42,930
for no look at the poor dogs human falls

177
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:44,980
down oh no the poor dogs look at them I

178
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:47,319
stumbled upon this funny sequence

179
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:50,050
randomly who just randomly goes through

180
00:08:47,319 --> 00:09:04,209
Google Street Jesus Christ take better

181
00:08:50,050 --> 00:09:06,939
care of your dogs you dummy there's also

182
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:10,240
wonderful images such as baby being born

183
00:09:06,939 --> 00:09:12,699
and naked man ain't sleeping trunk but

184
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:16,089
if you go to Gothenburg Sweden my

185
00:09:12,699 --> 00:09:19,839
hometown you enter satellite view and

186
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:23,680
you zoom in just enough on stalled young
