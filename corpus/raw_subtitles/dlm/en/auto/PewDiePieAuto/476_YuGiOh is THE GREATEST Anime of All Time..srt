00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:10,380
anime as a kid I think I was too old but

5
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,820
I'm really glad I didn't because now I

6
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,549
get to watch it as an adult and

7
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,350

8
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:18,390
ever reason I watched it okay I watched

9
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,310
it I watched a whole season but I want

10
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,740

11
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,869

12
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:28,730

00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:33,600
it let's let's review the episode

14
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:33,600
[Music]

15
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:44,720
you know other animes have some

16
00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:46,550
inspiring message we gotta be the number

17
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:53,440
one that kind of thing here it's just

18
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:57,879
like it's so bad hey Joey earth to Joey

19
00:00:53,440 --> 00:01:01,989
hey are you in there it's your turn

20
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:04,540
oh isn't it cute so the anime starts off

21
00:01:01,989 --> 00:01:07,390
with the main protagonist Yugi and Joey

22
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:10,600
for whatever reason Joey speaks in like

23
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:11,830
a thick New York accent hey Tristan Yugi

24
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:15,130
he's teaching me how to play duel

25
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:16,110
monsters drooling monsters duel monsters

26
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:19,180
you Nimrod

27
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:20,619
sheesh they've been at it for hours

28
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:22,570
Joey's starting to get the hang of the

29
00:01:20,619 --> 00:01:24,820
game they've been at it for hours in

30
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:27,430
school the game is so addicting go buy

31
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:29,020
it now they've been at it for hours like

32
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:33,190
Yugi's like an expert

33
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:35,649
okay Yugi it's time to duel see each

34
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:38,289
card has an attack number that's such a

35
00:01:35,649 --> 00:01:39,340
shitty card so apparently the mango this

36
00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:41,280
is really good

37
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:44,020
but the anime wanted to focus more on

38
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:47,200
selling actual products so it's more

39
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:48,789
based on the card right first player to

40
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,240
eliminate their opponents Life Points

41
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:54,429
wins the duel pretty good move pretty

42
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,409
good move hai and place the card on the

43
00:01:54,429 --> 00:01:58,539
fear way to give me huh

44
00:01:56,409 --> 00:02:01,990
I know this is for kids but I can't get

45
00:01:58,539 --> 00:02:07,180
over how dumb it is pretty good boo but

46
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:09,009
not that's a better card this is

47
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:11,500
literally what we used to do when we

48
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:13,209
didn't know it because we had too many

49
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,549
brain thoughts too many brain thoughts

50
00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:17,350
my brain is overloading okay when I was

51
00:02:15,549 --> 00:02:19,329
a kid hey I don't remember your name it

52
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:22,090
was some sort of foreign aid and I will

53
00:02:19,329 --> 00:02:23,769
sound racist if I say it but this'll

54
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,700
hurt didn't know how to play poker but

55
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:26,440
you know who you are I bet you're

56
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,940
watching he was like oh I know there was

57
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,380
a Pokemon I'm like alright let's play it

58
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:31,959
let's play pokemon that he's like

59
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:33,609
alright so basically you just picked the

60
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:35,200
first card of your deck and you place it

61
00:02:33,609 --> 00:02:37,690
down and that whoever has like the

62
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,250
strongest card wins the other person's

63
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,870
card and I'm like that sounds stupid and

64
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:44,049
he's like alright place a card and I'm

65
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:46,870
like alright it's some vulpix or some

66
00:02:44,049 --> 00:02:48,880
sheep and he just pulls out a shard

67
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:51,760
right away he was like all right your

68
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:55,750
card is mine now I'm like No so that's

69
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,100
how duel links work they figured it out

70
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,900
because no one knew how to play the game

71
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:00,910
even though they're so simple

72
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:04,290

00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:27,290
due to him

184
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:29,960
they played cards why is he dying why is

185
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:32,210
he on the floor what happened I want to

186
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:40,520
know I need to know what happened what

187
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:42,440
did he want you to teach that boy Kaiba

188
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:45,860
a lesson about the heart of the cards

189
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,960
but I lost and now I'm dying for no

190
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:49,820
reason so the whole concept is that

191
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,620
Kaiba believes in the power of the cards

192
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:54,710
but grand that is like there's hearts in

193
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:56,480
the cards yes actual hearts in the cards

194
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:57,950
you believe in the cards and you get

195
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,480
good cards basically if I'm like I

196
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:00,860
believe I draw a good card because I

197
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,450
believe in heart of card that's the

198
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:08,150
concept of Yugi I just explained it

199
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:11,780
how's the old man feeling how's he

200
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:13,730
feeling he's dying he's died hey you

201
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:15,860
sleaze what have you done to him

202
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:17,720
we had a duel that's all with each of us

203
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:24,230
putting up our most valuable card is the

204
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:26,240
prize and look at the prize I won no if

205
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:28,520
you want it why did he have to destroy

206
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,290
it can someone explain if he has three

207
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:32,990
or life to have four in a deck does he

208
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:35,810
know that just say he did not have to do

209
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:38,630
that yes the blue-eyes White Dragon is a

210
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:40,850
rare and powerful card and this one will

211
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:43,520
never be used against me you could have

212
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:48,740
just put it in your own deck ah my

213
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:51,560
blue-eyes White Dragon he's definitely

214
00:09:48,740 --> 00:10:00,530
dying now how could you do such a thing

215
00:09:51,560 --> 00:10:02,240
yogi but clearly it doesn't work your

216
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:06,020
garbage deck is not good enough gran

217
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:09,089
died I put my soul in these cards and I

218
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:12,439
taught you everything I know yogi

219
00:10:09,089 --> 00:10:15,779
then take my teaching respect to eat it

220
00:10:12,439 --> 00:10:18,689
I think it's a little too late for that

221
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:19,230
he destroyed your car that was the whole

222
00:10:18,689 --> 00:10:21,180
point

223
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:24,240
each khyber respect for the heart of the

224
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:26,540
cards Yuki but grandpa you need help

225
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,579
I've got to get you to a doctor sounds

226
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:31,680
but grandpa you need help we could take

227
00:10:29,579 --> 00:10:34,019
care of your grandpa while you take care

228
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,240
of creepy Kaiba teach that rich spoiled

229
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:38,220
brat would a real duels all about just

230
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,819
go and help your granddad what are you

231
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,999
doing

232
00:10:38,819 --> 00:10:43,709
everyone put your hands together oh yeah

233
00:10:41,999 --> 00:10:45,360
she gets this good idea to draw a smiley

234
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:46,860
face over everyone's hand it doesn't

235
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,709
even look like a smiley face what is

236
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:52,050
that maybe in the Japanese version they

237
00:10:49,709 --> 00:10:54,149
draw an actual kanji maybe that's why I

238
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:56,339
like friendship you can't really do that

239
00:10:54,149 --> 00:10:57,990
so they just drew it it's mine I really

240
00:10:56,339 --> 00:11:00,059
want to know if that's the case all

241
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:05,309
right okay there it's still it still is

242
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:09,480
more dramatic um than Japanese what I

243
00:11:05,309 --> 00:11:10,459
just really so they take him to the

244
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,290
hospital

245
00:11:10,459 --> 00:11:17,220
we each begin with 2000 Life Points

246
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:18,389
first player to hit zero losses so how

247
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:20,670
are they gonna make a card game

248
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:23,999
interesting for an anime well of course

249
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:25,829
Virtua epic arena is so epic for

250
00:11:23,999 --> 00:11:27,360
whatever reason Yugi has this thing

251
00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:28,649
around his neck but it looks like the

252
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,689
most uncomfortable thing you could

253
00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:32,399
possibly carry around your neck but he's

254
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:34,559
been carrying it around his neck because

255
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,449
for whatever reason and it makes him

256
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:37,920
transform you know in other animation

257
00:11:36,449 --> 00:11:40,410
like Sailor Moon that there's like this

258
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,389
cool transformation scene every time she

259
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:43,949
transformed right with Yugi oh it's the

260
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:46,100
same thing except it just he just

261
00:11:43,949 --> 00:11:49,739
screams Yugi oh and that's it

262
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,739
[Music]

263
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:56,060
and his balls dropped because his voice

264
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:58,300
gets 10 times deeper

265
00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:01,429
[Music]

266
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,429
[Applause]

267
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:15,940
what that now Kaiba prepare yourself

268
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:17,770
because it's time to do just instant

269
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:19,810
puberty right there that's how it

270
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:24,250
happens so let's begin

271
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:25,780
i attack Sumi giant all right so they

272
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:30,130
play epically there's no point in me

273
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:32,560
really doing this your fierce Knight is

274
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:35,860
destroyed but Kaiba doesn't just summon

275
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:39,250
one blue ice white dragon with my friend

276
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:39,790
feat Yugi but three blue-eyes white

277
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,070
dragon

278
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:44,890
for some reason grandpa in the hospital

279
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:51,370
as well can follow what's going on look

280
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:57,000
at it don't give up don't give up you

281
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:57,000
have to win why grandpa's counting on me

282
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:05,100
swords of revealing light it stops all

283
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:08,500
monsters on the field for three turns

284
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:10,330
how desperate then he also talks to his

285
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:13,020
granddad for someone claiming to have

286
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:15,880
faith you're giving up too easily Yugi

287
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:18,580
listen sometimes the cards are like a

288
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:21,610
puzzle you have to put all the different

289
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:23,040
pieces in their proper place shut up

290
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:26,080
you're dying grandpa

291
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,240
[Music]

292
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:32,780
I like the animation as well of the

293
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:38,000
attacks what is that

294
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:40,340
your judge man falls three blue-eyes

295
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,600
White Dragons my god it's almost like if

296
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:43,700
you would have had forth if he just

297
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,580
didn't destroy yet that would have been

298
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:48,470
so cool but anyway he's about to

299
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:50,810
assemble okay I understand this is very

300
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:53,900
complex but he's about to assemble the

301
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:55,970
unstoppable Exodia you need five cards

302
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:58,430
on the board and if you get all of them

303
00:13:55,970 --> 00:14:00,500
you win the game it's never been done

304
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:02,660
before but Yugi doesn't believe in

305
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:04,610
himself he doesn't he doubts the heart

306
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:06,890
of the cards is of Exodia but the odds

307
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:13,520
are against me the odds are against him

308
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:17,560
I don't think I can do this it senses my

309
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:21,290
doubt lose focus newbie don't lose faith

310
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:24,560
concentrate my deck senses my doubt

311
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:28,260

312
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:31,570

yourself the same card will show up

316
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,890
regardless does he understand that I

317
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,339
guess I don't believe in the heart of

318
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:42,010
the cards

319
00:14:39,339 --> 00:14:43,870
dad damn it here it is Paradis here's

320
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:46,270
the best line of the whole entire anime

321
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:49,540
draw your last pathetic card so I can

322
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:53,860
end this Yugi my grandpa's deck has no

323
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:56,770
pathetic cards Kaiba my grandpa's deck

324
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:59,710
doesn't have any pathetic cards Kaiba so

325
00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:08,110
good that's writing that's what it does

326
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:10,690
contain I've assembled all 5 special

327
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:13,570
cards Oh [ __ ] me I'd at least put

328
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:15,460
them so he makes the shape like that can

329
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:16,600
you at least put them like that I mean

330
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:19,430
that's pretty badass

331
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:22,730
not gonna lie that's pretty cool

332
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:22,730
[Music]

333
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:32,089
[Music]

334
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:34,700
exodia chases quite possible the liquor

335
00:15:32,089 --> 00:15:35,029
shop that kind able to call him there it

336
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,740
is

337
00:15:35,029 --> 00:15:40,889
Saudi ready for the main operate

338
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:40,889
[Music]

339
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:55,160
we did it you play only for power Kaiba

340
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:57,140
and that is why you lost but if you put

341
00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:01,370
your heart in the game there is nothing

342
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:02,899
you can't do but but how but believing

343
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:08,140
in the heart of the game is such a weak

344
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:11,329
mindset but the phrase just to kill me

345
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:20,690
if you true oh yeah here it gets even

346
00:16:11,329 --> 00:16:22,490
more confusing here what is going on

347
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:24,920
what is happening what did he just do to

348
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:28,010
it it just it just doesn't it just says

349
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:40,610
it just does it bear maybe now you will

350
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:43,160
begin to see he just shut up granny I

351
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:45,440
guess sir Seto Kaiba or uncontested

352
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:48,560
champion he's been defeated my god so

353
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,180
the new enemy is introduced Pegasus

354
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,220
who's his character trait is that he's

355
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:53,870
drinking wine and I swear to God

356
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:56,029
for because I watched the whole season

357
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:58,310
for like ten episodes all he does is

358
00:16:56,029 --> 00:16:59,149
drink wine he must be absolutely clean

359
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:01,820
hammered

360
00:16:59,149 --> 00:17:03,920
so yeah that's episode 1 of Yukio I

361
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:05,419
think it's great I know I'm over 30 I'm

362
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,790
not I'm not supposed to enjoy these

363
00:17:05,419 --> 00:17:09,589
things but it's so bad that it's good

364
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:11,900
you have to understand that distinction

365
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:14,480
I'm not gonna spoil what happens but

366
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:15,500

367
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,470
the Shadow Realm

368
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:21,829
so you he has to duel Pegasus and Joey

369
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:23,870
Joey joins a log what I'll show the

370
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:26,480
picture to Joey the reason why Joey has

371
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:29,450
to win it's because his sister serenity

372
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:32,570
which he hasn't seen in years might go

373
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:34,790
blind if he doesn't win that's believing

374
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:37,429
Joey draws a terrible card oh yeah it's

375
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:40,010
