to make it not make my wrist burn up

192
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,680
because i tend to play with the wasd

193
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,680
i don't know if you heard about that

194
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,000
let's make gaming laptop oh should we

195
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,920
make

196
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,920
comfortable for gamers no

197
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,000
so true modern literature reader haha

198
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,279
the author said

199
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,120
she didn't like trans people no classic

200
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,320
literature reader he hated black people

201
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,279
jews and women

202
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,480
i know i feel like i understand the

203
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,279
argument but i feel like it depends on

204
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,040
the medium

205
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:09,360
and how it exists in their literature

206
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,480
if that makes sense i feel like like

207
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,760
music

208
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,519
and books i i guess novels especially is

209
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,600
so distant from the author

210
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,560
at least in in my opinion i don't really

211
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,240
care what they did

212
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,760
as long as they didn't murder someone

213
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,959
and as long as it doesn't reflect their

214
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,440
literature who cares

215
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:27,519
chad versus sorry jack gets a four i got

216
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:31,200

219
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,800
became such a massive

220
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,399
meme online because he looked like a

221
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,839
robot and then

222
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,440
it became such a big deal that

223
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,920
zuckerberg just disappeared from the

224
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,120
