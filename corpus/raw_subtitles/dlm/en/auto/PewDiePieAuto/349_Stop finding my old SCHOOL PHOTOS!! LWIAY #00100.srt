like I was eight when I was 13 then yeah

35
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,610

player yeah that's right I definitely

39
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:04,409
was not seated in the front because I

40
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:05,040
was short that was not the case at all

41
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:07,799
ok

42
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,780
literally when they picked that I would

43
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:12,780
always sit down every photo I would have

44
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,800
to sit down so what I did ok I had this

45
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,620
photo I remember this

46
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,060
specifically because of the jacket when

47
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,530
we're in the group the photographer will

48
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,720
pick you out of the group and say like

49
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:25,050
oh you're short go front oh you're tall

50
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,730
go back I was like not this time mmm I

51
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:28,830
was hiding in the back this time I was

52
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:31,470
making sure I was not gonna sit for this

53
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:32,820
photo still that [ __ ] managed to

54
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:34,170
squeeze me and he's like wait a minute

55
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,870

and he was so proud that he found him

74
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:31,770
even though the guy said he was lying to

75
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:34,560

121
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:37,130
this is what I was trying to explain in

122
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:39,560
my last video my big brain theory that

123
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:42,380
side cut out for whatever reason okay

124
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,960
it's like bulk buying right you buy one

125
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:48,229
toilet paper it's pretty expensive you

126
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:51,560
buy 20 toilet paper it's pretty cheaper

127
00:05:48,229 --> 00:05:54,199
so surely maybe having 16 million

128
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,849
reaches 20 toilet papers do you

129
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:57,169
understand do you understand outside

130
00:05:55,849 --> 00:06:00,259
thank you

131
00:05:57,169 --> 00:06:03,289
so maybe we already planted 20 totally

132
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:05,599
paper when Elon Musk using my design for

133
00:06:03,289 --> 00:06:07,280
his car when Elon Musk is using my

134
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:08,810
design for his new car do you guys speak

135
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,710
English in this channel is that what's

136
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:14,810
happening is that what is that some kind

137
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:16,490
of Pikachu hybrid I didn't think the

138
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:18,259
truck was real for the longest time and

139
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:20,449
then I realized yeah actually makes

140
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:21,860
perfect sense old trucks have if you

141
00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:22,849
wash your whole conference you know the

142
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,860
way they talk about it

143
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:27,319
trucks have looked the same for forever

144
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,699
you have a company that is all male

145
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:31,039
dominant that doesn't give a [ __ ] if

146
00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:32,750
it's an electric environmental friendly

147
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,010
car you have a market that it means you

148
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:36,020
have a market that you you're gonna have

149
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:37,100
to switch it off properly to do it yeah

150
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,930
they can make a truck

151
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:41,000
it looks cool but like everyone else but

152
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:42,680
it wouldn't do well so I think is it's a

153
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,730
policy move and it's a right move and I

154
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,310
think it's cool

155
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:47,780

183
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:58,460
thing I've ever said I didn't realize

184
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,700
this this very expensive product was so

185
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:06,100
expensive drawing I did of Sean Marek

186
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:09,830

195
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:26,960

196
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,180
in-your-face

197
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,530
and you kind of cringe at it but you

198
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:32,690
still feel like you need to acknowledge

199
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:34,430
it so you kind of just pretend how long

200
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:35,750
that it's funny you know what you know

201
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:37,789

205
00:08:42,529 --> 00:08:45,800
and one of those more examples of that I

206
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:49,610
feel like there's so much humor that I

207
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:53,210

this stuff that's happening kids after

324
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:55,400
watching Nemo in 20 69 where are the

325
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:57,800

00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,020

is so sad I'm crying and shaking I think

337
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:30,830
the weirdest part of growing up is when

338
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:41,480
you when you hear someone from the year

339
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:44,150

glory from side because I've already

346
00:14:57,589 --> 00:15:01,910
probably doesn't get enough recognition

347
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,710
for all the hard work II - but I do my

348
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:05,420
thumbnails I've always done the
