my god my god so as you can see there's

31
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:39,150

a lot like a lot like I didn't want to

33
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:42,930
get ahead so I've just been that is move

34
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,299
on its own

35
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:49,110
I just been there building stuff so I

36
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:50,250
built this temple for Walter sheep it's

37
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:52,549
a water temple

38
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:56,009
so there's water flowing everywhere I

39
00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:56,909
spent a long time on this ok a very long

40
00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:00,810
time

41
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:05,040
oh my god it's for water shape of course

42
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:06,689
of course I have to do it to him and the

43
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,349
idea is that the water flows from the

44
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:11,220
water church into any it feeds it feeds

45
00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:12,880

00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:14,710
this home don't get me wrong it's just

66
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:16,480
that I've done 12 episodes I don't want

67
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:18,280
to just change midway through isn't that

68
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,040

pity pie pack that's fun right I just

75
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:46,330

77
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:50,650

84
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:23,199
all right all right so today we have a

85
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:24,910
lot of adventures I want to head out and

86
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,949
do some stuff that we haven't done

87
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:28,900
before but yeah it's looking clean like

88
00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:31,240
I really like my area I'm thinking about

89
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:34,570
maybe I build something in here one

90
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,699
episode like the enchantment room will

91
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:37,180
be built inside the trees like a tree

92
00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:39,220
Hut

93
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:41,050
that could be cool I have ideas guys I

94
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:42,690
have ideas I have a health part in

95
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:46,120
melons

96
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:49,720
whoa I don't know that was possible

97
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:52,780
oh yeah I fixed that I fixed now so it's

98
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:55,060
a button cuz everyone kept asking me to

99
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:56,650
do a button instead so there you go it's

100
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:59,289
always great whenever I build or do

101
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:02,520
something everyone's like wow that's so

102
00:04:59,289 --> 00:05:05,229
cool and then someone else just goes

103
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:07,840
sick of mode and makes it like 10 times

104
00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:09,520
better and I'm like are cool I was proud

105
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:15,789
of that but I guess you can do it better

106
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:17,979
huh okay I want to build a redstone for

107
00:05:15,789 --> 00:05:20,110
my farm I want to I'm getting tired of

108
00:05:17,979 --> 00:05:21,880
always farming I'm getting tired of

109
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:24,400
always doing all this hard work isn't

110
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:26,110
that right key idea bird claws oh my god

111
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,389
I haven't named you I'm so sorry I just

112
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:30,699
realized and this is also definitely the

113
00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:32,830
same IKEA bird as the last time and I

114
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:36,699
did not accidentally kill him while I

115
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:39,240
was killing zombies he flew right in

116
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:41,229
front of me what am I supposed to do I

117
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,590
didn't name the first one there doesn't

118
00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:43,330
matter

119
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:45,099
I like IKEA bread more than cloth

120
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:47,590
because everyone thinks cloths means

121
00:05:45,099 --> 00:05:50,020
Klaus and which it isn't you dummies

122
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:51,310
it's like a bird now learn it being

123
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:53,440
binding being bound we're gonna build

124
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:55,510
redstone contraptions for the farm I

125
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,210
don't know how you do it I just know you

126
00:05:55,510 --> 00:06:01,300
came everyone's been saying I should do

127
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:03,669
it I imagine I just use piston let's try

128
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:06,340
it out gamers do you think it's possible

129
00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:08,740
to not get sidetracked in Minecraft I

130
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:11,139
said I gotta call the record today I

131
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:13,169
guess it'll be like semi-automatic I'll

132
00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:16,479
still have to like press a button

133
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:22,299
so it's just like like that and then

134
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:24,389
that makes it go what can you guys I'm

135
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:25,839
trying to think I'm trying to think oh

136
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:32,679
my gosh

137
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:35,489
please replanting or at least do ah as

138
00:06:32,679 --> 00:06:38,649
punishment you stay with water sheep

139
00:06:35,489 --> 00:06:42,429
guard him my god it's you a nice man

140
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:48,249
okay oh wait how would I do it then if

141
00:06:42,429 --> 00:06:50,499
you put water yeah oh my god he does and

142
00:06:48,249 --> 00:06:53,709
he collects them as well that's genius

143
00:06:50,499 --> 00:06:57,610
okay we can do this ven too lazy to go

144
00:06:53,709 --> 00:07:00,459
back to the house so the idea is water

145
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:02,309
will come it will flow all the way it

146
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:04,929
will collect I might have to move this I

147
00:07:02,309 --> 00:07:05,679
can't just move Spence rollercoaster he

148
00:07:04,929 --> 00:07:11,379
loves it

149
00:07:05,679 --> 00:07:13,919
oh well too bad sorry scent it's he

150
00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:17,589
replaced I will rebuild it don't worry

151
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,639
and then we put slabs all the way so

152
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:20,559
there's no leakage

153
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:25,239
I know this ruins the beautiful metaphor

154
00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:30,819
oh my gosh that's perfect how part is it

155
00:07:25,239 --> 00:07:34,019
water run oh that is looking good damn

156
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:39,579
so here wait how do I stop the water

157
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:45,309
wait oh yes I forgot I need actual

158
00:07:39,579 --> 00:07:46,659
redstone wait okay okay this is becoming

159
00:07:45,309 --> 00:07:49,199
more and more complicated what am i

160
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:54,519
dying meanwhile people are building

161
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:57,639
computers in Minecraft Swedish boy tries

162
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:59,229

00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:08,999
right yes yes okay cool can barely tell

166
00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:13,119
it's there it doesn't look as dramatic

167
00:08:08,999 --> 00:08:20,039
but I think it works let it go let it

168
00:08:13,119 --> 00:08:20,039
flow yeah dude we're scientists then

169
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:30,870
