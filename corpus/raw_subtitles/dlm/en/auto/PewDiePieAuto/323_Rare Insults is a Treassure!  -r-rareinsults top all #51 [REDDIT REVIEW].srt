83
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:39,480

84
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,520

85
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:44,350

something horrible Society would be epic

202
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:52,480

203
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,550
society for saying bad words so I take

204
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,260

she'd be full court room exchange of the

259
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:19,210
day doctor before you perform the

260
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:22,420
autopsy did you check for a pulse

261
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:24,640
witness no attorney did you check for

262
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:27,160
blood pressure no did you check for

263
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:29,260
breathing no so then is it possible that

264
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:31,840
the patient was alive when you began the

265
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:36,390
autopsy no how can you be sure doctor

266
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:36,390
because his brain was sitting on my desk

267
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:42,370
but could the patient have still been

268
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:43,960
alive nevertheless yes it is possible

269
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:53,950
that he would have been alive and

270
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:56,080

300
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:08,080
fair enough if your girlfriend cheats on

301
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,970
you you need to understand that you like

302
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,650
something that made her cheat so instead

303
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:13,570
of leaving her for another girl found

304
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:15,760
out the air in yourself apologize to her

305
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:18,730

306
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:22,040
stark people actually think this blows

307
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:26,089

Chadd champion Chad champion with a

309
00:13:26,089 --> 00:13:31,070
great alter ego I have I have an alter

310
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:32,870
ego because I whenever I don't want

311
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:35,180
people to recognize my name when I order

312
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:36,800
stuff online it's something similar to

313
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:40,310
Chad champion but I kind of wish I

314
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:42,110

315
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:46,730

dog Ben started a keto diet is it

319
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:56,600
Charlie likes poking out about the keto

320
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:59,000
diet as well bro that makes it sadder

321
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:01,970
I'm sorry Charlie there's no recovery

322
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,130
from this YouTube comments are prime I

323
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:08,120
don't think so but Jimmy Fallon laughs

324
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:10,550
like he has trained my taste cooking me

325
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:13,300
spaghetti carbonara because it's my

326
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:16,040
birthday so when I finished this video

00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:18,440
your mom's so lazy she took nine years

328
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,759
to finish the date joke when some random

329
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,560
in the internet is more committed to a

330
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:26,630
you mama joke than your dad was to your

331
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:27,980
actual mom Tom looks like Eminem's

332
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:31,819
younger and lesser-known brother

333
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:34,010
skittles Oh Tom you probably had to

334
00:14:31,819 --> 00:14:35,810
shave his head for a part or something

335
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:39,170
it's weird I think Tom could actually

336
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:41,060
pull off but no he does it I always

337
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:43,639

338
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:45,889
always wanted to try it but I won't look

339
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:47,690
good I have a weird relationship with my

340
00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:49,279
hair I don't I don't like it that's why

341
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:51,589
I always wanted to shave it do a buzz
