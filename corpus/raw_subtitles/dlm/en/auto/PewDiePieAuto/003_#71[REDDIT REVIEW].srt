unaffected by fad comments but being

criticized harassed judged online for my

133
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:13,439

134
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:15,689

always let it ruin my entire life well

136
00:06:15,689 --> 00:06:19,169

people Christine have you thought of

138
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:23,610

00:06:21,509 --> 00:06:25,919
to be treated Christine have you thought

140
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:27,630

142
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:30,479
been that the people that write really

143
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:33,180

00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:37,499

149
00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:46,680

186
00:08:33,329 --> 00:08:37,380

00:08:41,569 --> 00:08:46,670
them I'm not gonna do it again but just

191
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:49,310

192
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:50,600
billionaire Jenner Kylie Jenner says her

193
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:53,810
sister teased her for being a

194
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:55,910
billionaire and it's so relatable it is

195
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:58,310
so freaking relatable didn't it come out

196
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:00,500
that she had changed her papers or

197
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:02,209
something just to make it seem I mean

198
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,279
was so obviously she's not a billionaire

199
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:06,860
anyway you don't have to yeah it was

200
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:09,519
revoked she exaggerated her company's

201
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:13,040
success for years what I'm so shocked

202
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:16,370

both rows last time I checked my dad did

250
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,760

251
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:34,820
down

252
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:37,670

00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:39,560
girl like that [ __ ] there's always one

254
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:41,540
there's always someone like this I hope

255
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:50,960
she sees this bro I'm sure she's gonna

256
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:54,410
see it and show her [ __ ] bro cringe as

257
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:56,840
we broke up videos way about God I know

258
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:59,090
there's just a shock because online it

259
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:01,840

260
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:01,840

261
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:20,640

vroom broom and I did the dance so epic

264
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:28,680
it's weird though cuz I'm glad people

265
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:30,810
like this exist because then I can feel

266
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:32,700
anyone can watch this and feel like well

267
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:34,320
at least I'm not that piece of [ __ ] you

268
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:38,010
know what I mean it doesn't that feel

269
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:40,320
good at least Elin trying desperately to

270
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:41,850
appeal to his diehard reddit demographic

271
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,080
minecraft has amazing legs and

272
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:44,700
everything they can get a good

273
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,080
multiplayer minecraft working on Tesla's

274
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,300
or maybe create a game that interacted

275
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:50,820
virtually with reality like pokemon gold

276
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:52,410
while driving safely I mean it sounds

277
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:54,180
fun to me I don't see the issue with

278
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:56,100
this I'm a bit of an Elon shield though

279
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:58,950
so maybe don't take my word for it but

280
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:00,990
I'm down it sounds fun you hate fun so

281
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:01,830
much but you don't play with Lego do you

282
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:04,200
cringe

283
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:06,390
I want anime companies and hygiene

284
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,310
product companies to start working

285
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:11,220
together more my theory is that if we

286
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:13,560
put Miku on body wash and shampoo then

287
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:17,130
we both start showering I mean you're

288
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:18,960
not wrong I don't care with that started

289
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:21,420
to regret almost everything about my

290
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:23,850

similar things happen at a much faster

366
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:10,120
rate in industrial farms and that is a

367
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:12,100
serious issue people don't seem to care

368
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:13,540
about theirs yet make donations to

369
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:15,699
rescue the animals in Australia which

370
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:17,079
don't get me wrong that's fantastic but

371
00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:18,910
it's hypocritical to then dismiss all

372
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:21,939
the suffering which is arguably worse

373
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:24,520
and factually much bigger that goes in

374
00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:25,780
that burger you just munched I actually

375
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:28,990
thought I thought about this the other

376
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:30,910
day was my thought my very interesting

377
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:32,830
thought okay yeah it was something about

378
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:36,730
canceled and how people are so upset

379
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:38,679
over injustice online or what seems like

380
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:39,850
injustice of people doing bad things so

381
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:42,340
they cancel them and that's always

382
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:44,620
happening oh this person did this you're

383
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:46,960
done but no and I think most people

384
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:48,990
don't like to see animals in pain but if

385
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,550
you look at it inside a lot of

386
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:53,920
industries where the how they treat

387
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:56,890
animal behind-the-scenes inside these

388
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:58,960
farms or inside the or the way they're

389
00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:01,150
killed it's uncomfortable people would

390
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,630
like it I guarantee you you wouldn't

391
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:06,880
like it at least in the in the mass

392
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:08,679
killing and mass production at least not

393
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,940
talking about local farms my point here

394
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:12,640
I think people don't care so much about

395
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:15,100
the animals even though if you get upset

396
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,410
about the killing of animals then that

397
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:19,809
also means that you are partaking in it

398
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:21,250
which in a way makes you bad when

399
00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:23,020
canceled culture is all about calling

400
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:24,850
out other people bad so I can feel good

401
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:26,679
but you can't really do that when you

402
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:28,660
look at animal issues and how they're

403
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:31,750
treated cuz it's like what you you have

404
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:33,680
to at least be a vegan or vegetarian to

405
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:36,650
do that which is why there are

406
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:38,600
so knowing okay okay I got it I got the

407
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:40,730
perfect example okay let's put it this

408
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:43,550
way if everyone was vegan and vegetarian

409
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:45,260
and then they saw how animals were

410
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:46,790
treated then for sure people would be

411
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:48,350
like I can't believe they're doing this

412
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:50,060
it's awful

413
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:52,130
and considering how often people get

414
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:54,710
called out on it online it it's weird

415
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:57,170
how that it's never it doesn't get any

416
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:59,360
traction oh it's me it's me guys God

417
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:02,690
creating vegans oh just a little bit of

418
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:07,450
logic up too much I'm not being by the

419
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:10,460
way too much logic guys just hurts

420
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:12,080
listen all I'm saying is there's a weird

421
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:14,480
gap right now with people on the

422
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:17,330
internet getting very upset about how

423
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:21,050
animals are mistreated and ignoring a

424
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:22,670
lot of [ __ ] that's happening in in the

425
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:23,240
reality of the meat industry that's all

426
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:24,800

all right eat whatever you want I don't

428
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:32,420
