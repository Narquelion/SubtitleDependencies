00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,770
- All right children, it's a new decade,

3
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:19,540
it's time to face the facts.

4
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,210
How do I put this delicately?

5
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,520
Your humble hostess is a total lez.

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,680
Ugh, shame!

7
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,340
You're probably worried this is a coming out video,

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,230
and I'm sorry to tell you that it is,

9
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,060
but, oh, it's so much worse than just that.

10
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:38,850
You know, one coming out may be regarded as a misfortune,

11
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,670
two, looks like carelessness, and three,

12
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:45,050
well, at that point you're just doing it for attention.

13
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:48,050
And I do love attention, I wanna be very clear about that,

14
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,920
but I also happen to be gay.

15
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,860
Some gay people love attention.

16
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,400
It's been known to happen.

17
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,390
So there comes a time in a woman's life when you have

18
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,410
to take a step back, look yourself in the mirror,

19
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:04,810
and admit this is some high key lesbicious behavior.

20
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:07,730
And I'm gonna talk you through how I got to that point.

21
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:09,010
So, storytime!

22
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:10,520
I fell in love with my best friend.

23
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,353
Storytime!

24
00:01:11,353 --> 00:01:12,840
Telling my boyfriend I'm a lesbian.

25
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,680
Storytime!

26
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,760
My parents walked in on my Taco Bell mukbang.

27
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,690
Exposed!

28
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:17,523
Graphic!

29
00:01:17,523 --> 00:01:18,600
The tea is piping hot!

30
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,720
For a long time on this channel my official story has been

31
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,387
that I'm bi.

32
00:01:23,387 --> 00:01:24,720
I'm super fucking bi.

33
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,180
But I haven't dated women since I transitioned,

34
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,810
and for a while there, I got pretty deep

35
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:31,210
into the straight lifestyle.

36
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:33,030
This really started in 2018.

37
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,267
By that summer I had privately convinced myself

38
00:01:36,267 --> 00:01:40,280
that I was a fully heterosexual woman. Unhh!

39
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,070
And we're gonna circle back to how I reached

40
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:44,210
that conclusion, but I'm starting

41
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:47,440
in the middle of things, I'm like an epic poet.

42
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,410
Hail Muse!

43
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:49,870
Hey how are you gorg!

44
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:52,860
So, at the beginning of 2018 I became close friends,

45
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,333
I'd even say best friends, with a woman whomst I'll call.

46
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,280
Joanne.

47
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,330
Light of my life.

48
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,560
Can we get some melodramatic music please?

49
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,550
Yeah, here we go.

50
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:05,970
You're gonna wanna pour yourself a glass

51
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:06,803
of something nice.

52
00:02:06,803 --> 00:02:09,350
I want you to fully enjoy my pain.

53
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:12,670
So my friendship with Joanne got very intense, very fast.

54
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:13,780
It was that kind of friendship

55
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,790
where you develop your own private language

56
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:18,260
of references and in jokes, and you drive everyone

57
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,650
around you crazy with your unintelligible banter.

58
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,320
We'd call each other pretty much every day

59
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,750
and we'd talk for hours.

60
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,070
And I don't think I've ever called her and not been laughing

61
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,860
or smiling in the first twenty seconds,

62
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:31,150
which is very unusual for me, because I am a weird,

63
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,870
and I don't get along that well with so many people.

64
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,430
One reason we got so emotionally close is, we're both trans.

65
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,480
And there's a kind of intuitive understanding

66
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,210
and a sense of humor that I can share

67
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:43,870
with another trans woman, that I can't really have

68
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:44,850
with anyone else.

69
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:47,350
Oh, and by the way, Joanne also happens

70
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:50,480
to be just angelically beautiful,

71
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,310
which I did notice every time I looked at her.

72
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,900
And from the beginning of this relationship,

73
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,430
it wasn't sexual, but it wasn't exactly platonic either.

74
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,280
We'd get drunk and make out, we'd sleep

75
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,380
in the same bed and cuddle.

76
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,760
Straight girls do that right?

77
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,790
Gal pals!

78
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,860
I remember one of the first times I hung out

79
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:11,070
with Joanne we got our nails done together.

80
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,680
And that night, we were barhopping

81
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,940
and she took my pretty hand in her pretty hand

82
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,590
and we walked down the street together holding hands.

83
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,480
This is a garbage and I wanna die!

84
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,440
I hope you all know that I'm in agony.

85
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,290
Later we were at a bar table with friends,

86
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:27,780
and every time one of us needed a drink we'd run off

87
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,270
to the bar and she'd secretly kiss me.

88
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:33,800
Ugh, it's still one of the most magical gay things

89
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,860
that's ever happened to me.

90
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,730
Joanne had a boyfriend at the time, but he didn't care.

91
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:40,000
A lot of men think girls kissing is hot,

92
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,790
but they don't take it seriously.

93
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,480
They don't think it could ever mean anything

94
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,336
or lead to a real relationship.

95
00:03:45,336 --> 00:03:46,533
Gal pals!

96
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:48,903
Just kill me.

97
00:03:48,903 --> 00:03:51,310
Take me out behind the shed, put me down humanely,

98
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:54,650
and just buy a new YouTuber before the kids get home,

99
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:55,670
and they won't notice.

100
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:59,240
So this very intimate friendship went on for about a year,

101
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,960
without me acknowledging to Joanne or to myself

102
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,970
that I was falling in love.

103
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:07,230
So, not only was I in denial about being in love with her,

104
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:10,520
but at the same time, I had basically convinced myself

105
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,910
that I only wanted to date men.

106
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,850
So how could I possibly think that?

107
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:17,630
Well, the short answer is shame.

108
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:20,240
Why is no one talking about the shame?

109
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,430
I was so ashamed of my attraction to women

110
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,240
that there were days I thought the shame

111
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,470
was gonna crush me to death.

112
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:29,200
Oh, I wanted to be straight so bad.

113
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,250
And let no one say I didn't make a strong attempt.

114
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,200
There should honestly be a statue of me sucking dick

115
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,410
in the town square, with the inscription,

116
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,580
"Here knelt Natalie Wynn, attempted heterosexual."

117
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,080
I'm a bronze star lesbian.

118
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,680
Well, if we're really being honest,

119
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,490
I don't think I get a star.

120
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:48,470
Oh I was desperate to be straight.

121
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:51,260
I tried prayer, I tried electric shocks.

122
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:54,210
All the classics, all the hits.

123
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,940
You know the idea is if you shock yourself

124
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,270
every time you think about women,

125
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,080
you start to associate the two in your head.

126
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,463
So now I'm a lesbian and I enjoy electric shocks.

127
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,930
This is supposed to hurt, but I just feel like I'm

128
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,580
on a road trip with Cate Blanchett.

129
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,130
So at some point the shame was just too much for me,

130
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:12,390
and it literally broke my brain.

131
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:15,880
I no longer wanted to be straight, I simply deluded myself

132
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,800
into thinking I was straight. Maybe a little bi.

133
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,670
A little bit.

134
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,530
By that time I'd started dating men,

135
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,710
and I got into a serious long-term relationship with a man.

136
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,420
And at first I explained away my feelings

137
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,110
for Joanne by telling myself, female friendships are

138
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:34,110
just really intense, that's probably why I feel so strongly.

139
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,910
And everyone thinks women are beautiful,

140
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:39,943
so it's only natural I'd notice that, and, you know,

141
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:43,603
spend a lot of time thinking about it.

142
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,390
So this nonsense went on until the beginning of last year.

143
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,010
And then, two things happened.

144
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:52,647
First, Joanne started dating a cis lesbian.

145
00:05:52,647 --> 00:05:55,397
(dramatic Music)

146
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:00,300
Fuck my drag, right?

147
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,570
I think before that, I always knew she was bi,

148
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:05,920
but some combination of self-interested denial

149
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,780
and biphobia allowed me to write off my initial crush

150
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,880
on her as, I just have a thing for my straight best friend.

151
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,460
Like, who doesn't?

152
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,190
But that's a very self-serving narrative

153
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:17,840
because it quarantines your feelings inside the safety

154
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,960
of unattainable fantasy, and it wards off the pain

155
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,330
of potential rejection.

156
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:24,420
'Cause that way it's not really me, she's rejecting,

157
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,650
it's just, she's just not that into women.

158
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,760
But once she started dating women,

159
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,400
I couldn't tell myself that anymore.

160
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,730
And the jealousy hit me so hard I couldn't ignore it.

161
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:37,440
Second, around that same time, Joanne decided

162
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,010
to visit me for a few weeks,

163
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:40,650
it was a long distance friendship.

164
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,410
And about halfway through that visit, I cracked.

165
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:47,493
One morning, I woke up next to her-gal pals!

166
00:06:47,493 --> 00:06:49,720
And I looked at her pretty fucking face

167
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,030
and I had the thought, I wanna wake up

168
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,700
next to you every day of my life.

169
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,810
And that is a pretty alarming thought

170
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:01,690
for a petite heterosexual biogirl to have about her gal pal.

171
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:05,050
Oh, never in my life have I fallen so deeply

172
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:05,883
in love with someone.

173
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:07,660
Like what the fuck is this?

174
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,850
What am I feeling?

175
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:12,480
I was experiencing an intensity of emotion that has no right

176
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,730
to exist outside of 19th century Italian opera.

177
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:18,280
So I confessed my feelings to Joanne,

178
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,540
and-love confession gone wrong!

179
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,513
Devastating!

180
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,710
she did not reciprocate my feelings.

181
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:26,740
Nurse!

182
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,210
My pain is at a 10, I need more pills!

183
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:31,210
Needless to say, my heart was shattered,

184
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,940
I cried a sea of tears, blah blah blah.

185
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,480
I'm sure we all know how that goes.

186
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,420
And here's the thing, if we'd taken

187
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:39,180
a three-month friendship break right then and there,

188
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,230
I might have recovered.

189
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:42,430
But we couldn't keep away from each other.

190
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,880
She wasn't in love with me but She must have been

191
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,210
in something with me because the truth is we were never

192
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:49,600
just gal pals.

193
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,950
And I was beyond reason, like,

194
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,070
I probably would've started one

195
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:56,350
of those lesbian couple joint Instagram accounts,

196
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,700
that's how tragic this got.

197
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,640
Those are great by the way.

198
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,180
Pay no attention to bitter queens.

199
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,270
So for the rest of 2019 Joanne and I kept talking,

200
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:05,470
kept visiting each other, and I just repeated

201
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:07,830
this heartbreak again and again and again.

202
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:10,450
Now, if she had reciprocated my feelings,

203
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:12,360
I probably would've come out as gay last year.

204
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,910
Because the heat of a romantic relationship has a way

205
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,470
of evaporating shame.

206
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:19,670
But rejection and the heartbreak are shameful in themselves,

207
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,430
and only made the situation worse.

208
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:24,450
So I spent most of 2019 going in and out of denial,

209
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:28,420
until finally, last October, I got super fucking canceled

210
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,430
on Twitter, as discussed in my last video.

211
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,580
Link in the description!

212
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,530
Subscribe!

213
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:34,670
And at the same time, Joanne realized

214
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:36,150
that she was gonna have to be the one

215
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,810
to enforce a friendship break,

216
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:39,880
otherwise I was never gonna get over her.

217
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,590
So there was this combination of things,

218
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,360
being politically canceled by Twitter,

219
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,550
being romantically canceled by Joanne,

220
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:48,830
and also losing her as my closest friend, which sent me

221
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:52,530
into a catatonic, rock bottom kind of depression.

222
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,470
And of course depression is a terrible thing,

223
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:57,180
but I think it can also serve a purpose.

224
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:00,150
Because depression brings your life to standstill,

225
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:03,000
and in the quiet of that standstill you sometimes

226
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,760
feel outside yourself.

227
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,090
And with that comes a new perspective.

228
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:09,250
So last December, when I was lying around

229
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,800
drinking White Claw all day and binge-watching

230
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,800
Orange is the Bluest L Word, I actually didn't feel

231
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,630
so much shame anymore, and that gave me

232
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:18,750
a new kind of clarity.

233
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,150
I looked back on the last couple years and I saw

234
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,140
that I'd been avoiding the obvious.

235
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,690
So, that's what it took for me

236
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:29,520
to finally face the fact that I am a,

237
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,710
I am a gay.

238
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:31,563
Not clickbait.

239
00:09:32,784 --> 00:09:35,284
(fey music)

240
00:09:53,153 --> 00:09:56,903
Adam's a great guy and all but... I want Lilith.

241
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,810
Shame!

242
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:07,610
This floral fantasy is a little less mother of mankind,

243
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:10,440
and a little more Coachella 2015.

244
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,580
Well that's my Eden!

245
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,770
Candy flipping!

246
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:13,603
I love it!

247
00:10:13,603 --> 00:10:16,070
Ok, let's circle back and talk about

248
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:18,700
how a wholesome homo like me wound up in the clutches

249
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,800
of the straight agenda.

250
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,820
It starts with denial, and there's two sides to gay denial.

251
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,850
First there was the period where I repressed

252
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,820
or explained away my attraction to women.

253
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,870
"Female friendships are just really intense,

254
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,820
straight girls have girl crushes too."

255
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,350
And second, I experienced and acted on

256
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:35,570
what I genuinely thought was sexual

257
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:37,150
and romantic attraction to men.

258
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,200
And to be honest, I'm still kind of struggling

259
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,370
to make sense of all this.

260
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:42,450
Maybe I'm not quite ready to make this video,

261
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:44,690
but I'm afraid that if I don't,

262
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:46,480
the shame will overpower me again,

263
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,250
and I'll slide back into denial.

264
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:51,460
So, while I'm still thinking semi-clearly,

265
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,930
lemme talk you through the struggle.

266
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:54,890
Because like most queer people,

267
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:57,780
I find nothing more fascinating than an in-depth analysis

268
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,950
of my own personality.

269
00:10:58,950 --> 00:10:59,960
She's a Libra!

270
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,920
So in 2017 I started taking feminizing hormones.

271
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,560
Most people are aware of the more obvious effects of that,

272
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:10,410
like it makes you grow breasts, at least in theory.

273
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:11,540
I just added progesterone.

274
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,710
I will see if that does anything.

275
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:14,290
But the lesser known thing is it has

276
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:17,110
some pretty major effects on your mood and your sexuality.

277
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,580
The first few months I was on hormones I actually wondered

278
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:22,930
if I was now asexual, because the libido I had known

279
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:24,910
before was just gone.

280
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:27,770
But I'm very much not asexual, it just took me a while

281
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:32,770
to adjust to an endocrinologically female sex drive.

282
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:35,240
One of the differences for me is it's not

283
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,230
as obvious now whomst I'm attracted to.

284
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,330
Just looking at an attractive person,

285
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:44,600
well let's put it this way, it sparks my interest,

286
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,040
but it doesn't light my fire.

287
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,610
It's not the instant inferno

288
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:49,640
that is testosterone-fueled lust.

289
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,230
Instead it's a slow burn that has to be built up.

290
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:54,090
Some people call this demisexual,

291
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:56,870
which is a term I'm ambivalent about,

292
00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:00,240
but I think the concept it describes applies to me.

293
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,100
Like I form little crushes on people based

294
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,160
on watching their YouTube videos or whatever,

295
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,200
but I don't feel intense sexual attraction to anyone

296
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,090
until I've gotten close to them as a friend.

297
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:11,010
So I have hard time getting too excited

298
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:12,610
about casual dating, you know?

299
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:15,440
Can't I just find a new best friend, fall insanely

300
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,020
in love with her, and then get gay married?

301
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,190
I know that's not how this works.

302
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:20,490
I have to play the field.

303
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,930
I also think it's a reason I don't really

304
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:24,140
like porn that much.

305
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:27,610
Because sex without context is just mechanics to me.

306
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:28,630
It's boring.

307
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:31,710
The build-up of desire, that's the interesting part,

308
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:35,600
and the struggle between desire and shame, I shouldn't,

309
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,220
but I want to.

310
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,010
That's how you build a plotline kids.

311
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:40,330
I'm also guessing that this kind

312
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:44,110
of slow-burn sexuality is more common in women than in men.

313
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:46,920
And I wonder if that's a reason why gay men tend

314
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,810
to know they're gay at an earlier age than gay women.

315
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,610
When you have teenage boy testosterone levels it's harder

316
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:55,860
to be agnostic or mistaken about who you're attracted to.

317
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,730
Whereas there's a lot of gay women

318
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:00,470
who don't realize they're gay until they're under 30s,

319
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:01,310
or even later.

320
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:03,970
And thank god for them, they make me feel less bad

321
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,350
about my wasted youth.

322
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:08,350
So it's hard for me to use visual sexual interest

323
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:09,860
as a guide to my sexuality.

324
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,910
Because I do feel aesthetic attraction

325
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,990
towards beautiful people of any gender,

326
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:16,170
and I can be pretty intense in its own right.

327
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,230
I guess the difference for me is looking

328
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:23,020
at a beautiful woman is more emotionally captivating to me

329
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,710
than looking at a beautiful man, which can be moving,

330
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:29,850
in it's own way but it's more like the way I'm moved by,

331
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,960
I don't know, the Parthenon.

332
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:36,120
You know it's sturdy, symmetrical, has impressive columns.

333
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,040
And that's not to say it's totally asexual

334
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,530
I mean I'd fuck the Parthenon.

335
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:40,790
I'd fuck it so hard.

336
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:43,740
I admit I do have some kind of erotic fascination

337
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,300
with masculinity, and maybe that stems

338
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,890
from my pre-transition sense of having failed

339
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:52,010
at masculinity, so I'm mesmerized by the real thing?

340
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:54,370
There's something about the contrast between me

341
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:59,250
and a masculine man that's sexually intriguing to me.

342
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:02,000
Like I've sometimes pleasantly gasped

343
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
at the feeling of hairy, muscly arms enfolding

344
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,960
my smooth, fragile body.

345
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,793
Eee!

346
00:14:10,793 --> 00:14:12,090
Or maybe it's more Freudian.

347
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:15,300
The masculine man as daddy, the archetypal father.

348
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,180
The symbolic power of the phallus.

349
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,800
Penetration as the ultimate expression

350
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,010
of desire and possession.

351
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:23,090
There's a lot of sexual connotations to manhood,

352
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:25,530
and I think that's why I can look at a sexy man

353
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:28,220
and create plausible fantasies in my head,

354
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:31,030
where I'd absolutely enjoy letting him do things to me.

355
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:33,660
And I can find things I like about male bodies.

356
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,663
Like, they're very warm.

357
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,537
I love it when you get under the covers with a man

358
00:14:38,537 --> 00:14:40,220
and he warms you up.

359
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,140
But that's when the lesbian voice comes into my head

360
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:45,690
and says, but are you attracted to men?

361
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:48,050
Or do you just like being warm?

362
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:50,010
My attraction to women is very different.

363
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:52,240
I look at a beautiful woman and it's just like

364
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,680
oh nooooo you're gorgeous you're beautiful

365
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,800
this is going to destroy me.

366
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,350
You know it can actually be painful

367
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,690
how beautiful a woman is.

368
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:03,950
I've never once been in pain over male beauty.

369
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:06,570
But around Joanne, once I was open about my feelings

370
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:08,510
and things got bad, there'd be moments I'd have

371
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:11,220
to just look away from her and be like, don't even enter

372
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,180
my line of sight right now, you're too beautiful,

373
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,400
I can't stand it.

374
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,150
There's a kind of sick masochism in wanting someone

375
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,380
who doesn't want you back.

376
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,710
It's insatiable, like an addiction.

377
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:23,710
And on the flipside, there's an intense erotic thrill

378
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,250
in being desired.

379
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,200
I think that's what got me interested in men

380
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,330
in the first place.

381
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:31,260
It's that they were interested in me.

382
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,510
And that's pretty interesting.

383
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:36,240
I've felt desired by men in a way

384
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,470
I've never truly felt desired by women.

385
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,420
You know a man will glower at you

386
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:44,360
with that agitated carnivorous desperation.

387
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,480
Fuck me up king!

388
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,730
God that's hot.

389
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:48,200
Gets me every time.

390
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,120
But notice how excitement at the attention,

391
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,390
the flattery of being desired, is not the same thing

392
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:57,790
as attraction to men.

393
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,570
You know, there's a difference between, "I want you."

394
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:03,000
and, "I like that you want me."

395
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,780
But for a long time I confused one for the other.

396
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:08,350
And one reason I was able to do that is

397
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:12,730
that the normative sexual role for women is to be pursued,

398
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:17,420
possessed, desired, seduced, dominated by men.

399
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,790
It's all very passive.

400
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:22,160
And in most of the sexual encounters I've had with men,

401
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,500
I've taken a very submissive role.

402
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,560
Sometimes I just submit to the glower,

403
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,997
and let him do things to me.

404
00:16:28,997 --> 00:16:31,050
And I do think that the thrill

405
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:34,630
of being desired is a valid thing to want.

406
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:38,260
I like that feeling myself, and I do genuinely enjoy taking

407
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:41,130
on a more submissive role sometimes, but you have to go

408
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,340
about it thoughtfully.

409
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:46,530
Because if you don't, sexual submission can be a way

410
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:50,700
to avoid confronting what your desires actually are.

411
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,600
It's freedom from freedom.

412
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,800
And if you're ashamed of your sexual orientation,

413
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,990
and ashamed of your transsexual body, and ashamed of having

414
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:00,910
any sexual feelings at all because of stigma

415
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:03,400
about trans women being fetishists,

416
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,490
then relinquishing responsibility for your own desires

417
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,810
by letting someone else take control,

418
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:11,910
can be the only way you can enjoy sex at all.

419
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:14,000
And for a while it's almost be the only way

420
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,887
I could enjoy it.

421
00:17:14,887 --> 00:17:17,960
And I was able to convince myself that was normal,

422
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,690
because the sexual situation of a lot of cis straight women

423
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:23,690
isn't really that much more liberated.

424
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:26,410
Like I read 50 Shades of Grey years ago

425
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:28,980
and totally identified with the fantasy,

426
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,430
and later I thought that was evidence

427
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:34,000
I had normative female desires.

428
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,610
Never mind that I was identifying

429
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:37,420
with the midlife crisis fantasies

430
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:40,390
of a repressed English housewife longing to be brutalized

431
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:42,050
by a capitalist tyrant.

432
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:44,710
I mean, not to shame women who genuinely do enjoy

433
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,860
a healthier version of that fantasy,

434
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,840
I think a lot of women pointlessly suffer

435
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,010
under a kind of feminist guilt about that.

436
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:54,050
But what makes me different is that for me submission

437
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:56,380
to a man was simply the only way

438
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,200
I could enjoy sex without shame.

439
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,430
And that's a lot of what I did for a couple years,

440
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:03,770
even though my real sexual attraction is to women.

441
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:07,090
Whereas, even in the most patriarchal situation,

442
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:10,760
straight women are ultimately attracted to men,

443
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,600
and sexually aroused by male bodies.

444
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,760
Or are they?

445
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,170
Gay men certainly are,

446
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:18,020
and gay women are just rhapsodic about women,

447
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:21,180
but a lot of straight women are just kind of meh

448
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,280
about male bodies and men in general.

449
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,100
What is that about?

450
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,120
I just...

451
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,950
I just I do not understand straight women.

452
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,720
I don't think I ever will.

453
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,570
And that's okay.

454
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,450
I'm just gonna accept my bewilderment,

455
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:36,360
and move on with my lesbian life.

456
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,390
Now, what I've been giving you so far

457
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:42,800
is a retrospective analysis, an autopsy

458
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,330
of my romantic failings of the last two years.

459
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:47,120
But you have to understand that when I was living

460
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,830
through this, I experienced it very differently,

461
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,890
because I didn't have these insights.

462
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:54,680
So I wasn't thinking, oh I'm not really attracted to men,

463
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,170
but I enjoy the thrill of being desired by them,

464
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,520
so I'm gonna pursue that to distract myself

465
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,710
from how ashamed I am of my attraction to women.

466
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:05,760
No, subconsciously I put my attraction to women on mute,

467
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,260
at least until Joanne ruined my life.

468
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,530
And I genuinely thought I was attracted to men,

469
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:13,990
which was a lot more than just a frivolous sexual fantasy.

470
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:17,410
I had a serious long-term boyfriend for a year and a half,

471
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:19,910
who I had very genuine feelings for.

472
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,020
Plot twist!

473
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,050
Storytime!

474
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:25,590
So my ex-boyfriend, let's call him Chad.

475
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:32,230
Oh, and he was a Chad, like full Giga-Chad fantasy.

476
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:35,330
You know, he was very masculine, taller than me,

477
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:37,630
objectively attractive, very charming.

478
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:39,380
Straight women used to tell me all the time

479
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,100
they were jealous of me for being with him.

480
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,060
And obviously I loved that.

481
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:47,250
To me, Chad represented almost an ideal of manhood,

482
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:50,000
a sort of archetypal romantic lead

483
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,740
who swept me off my feet and fulfilled my sick fantasies

484
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,460
of being a heterosexual woman.

485
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,500
Now you probably think I'm gonna say that he was

486
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,650
just an abstract fantasy to me, but that once it came

487
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:03,780
to actually dating I realized I didn't like it.

488
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,330
But honestly, it's more complicated than that.

489
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:09,860
Like, at the beginning, I was the one who pursued him.

490
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,940
And, I still think of him as the one genuine boy crush

491
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:13,970
of my life.

492
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:16,740
When we started dating, it was really exciting.

493
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:19,020
I never had a boyfriend before, and he'd never been

494
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,850
with a trans woman before, and we had

495
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:24,290
this adorably heterosexual energy together,

496
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,450
like holding hands in the park.

497
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:27,480
It was cute!

498
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,460
This would be a better lesbian story if Chad was a cad.

499
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,600
But he wasn't.

500
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,433
He was great.

501
00:20:32,433 --> 00:20:35,190
He took a very good care of me, he was never ashamed

502
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:37,460
to be seen with me, or of his friends

503
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:40,290
and family knowing he was dating me, which,

504
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:43,200
if you're a trans woman, that's a huge deal.

505
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,710
He was a lot less ashamed of me than I am of myself,

506
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:50,450
and when I was with him I was not ashamed.

507
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:53,010
And that meant a lot.

508
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:55,820
So, I really wanted this to work, like,

509
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:59,200
if I was gonna be with a man, he was the one.

510
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,260
And for a year or so, I thought it was working.

511
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,760
I enjoyed the time we spent together, I missed him

512
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:08,530
when he was gone, I told him I loved him and I meant it.

513
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:11,360
But what happened is by the end of the first year,

514
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,760
the initial excitement died down, and while Chad was ready

515
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,720
to keep escalating the relationship, I was realizing

516
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:23,630
that something was very seriously emotionally wrong

517
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:25,810
on my end, there was something missing.

518
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:29,200
And when I realized I was in love with Joanne,

519
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,040
I was like, there's that missing feeling.

520
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:35,260
And I started to understand what my problem was.

521
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:40,100
Then, last Fall, I posted to Instagram an aloof picture

522
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:43,620
of me with the caption, Do I actually like men?

523
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,100
Or do I just like attention?

524
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,870
And I didn't mean anything serious by that.

525
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,460
I was just joking around.

526
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,560
you know you can post something like that, and a bunch

527
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:53,543
of straight women will respond like, "Yeah, fuck men!"

528
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,190
What is their damage?

529
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,490
Well, they're stuck dating men.

530
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:58,323
That's their damage.

531
00:21:58,323 --> 00:22:00,390
But a few people left comments saying,

532
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:02,600
oh are you making a video about comphet?

533
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,460
You should make a video about comphet.

534
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:07,240
And I was like, what the f*ck is comphet?

535
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,660
So I googled it and I learned that comphet is short

536
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,770
for compulsory heterosexuality.

537
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:15,360
Basically it's the idea that heterosexuality

538
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,820
is socially required of women, and it's so bound up

539
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:21,350
with the conventional idea of what it even means

540
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:25,340
to be a woman, that gay women often mistakenly believe

541
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,970
for years that they're attracted to men.

542
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:30,620
And this Google search led me to a reddit post

543
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,967
called the "Am I a Lesbian Masterdoc",

544
00:22:32,967 --> 00:22:36,640
and I'm reading through this post like, oh no,

545
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,270
this sounds terribly familiar.

546
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:42,720
Quote, "compulsory heterosexuality is the voice in my head

547
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,930
that says I must really be het even when I'm in love

548
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:46,800
with a woman."

549
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,310
Quote, "you have every reason to be happy

550
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:51,220
in your relationship with a man,

551
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:54,100
but you just aren't, everything is going really well,

552
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,830
but something is missing and you can't figure out what."

553
00:22:56,830 --> 00:23:00,030
So next thing you know, I'm doing tequila shots at 3 a.m.

554
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:02,370
and taking "Am I a Lesbian" Internet quizzes

555
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:04,620
that were clearly designed for 13-year-olds.

556
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:07,410
And I'm fully a 31-year-old transsexual taking

557
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:10,560
this quiz like, "It's true, Samantha was right,

558
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,150
I am a total lez!"

559
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:14,110
All the cis gay people watching this video

560
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,870
probably wanna kill me right now,

561
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:17,930
'cause y'all figured this shit out in high school

562
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:20,270
and I'm sitting here in my 30s like

563
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:23,010
[Unintelligible whining]

564
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:25,940
Well, can I be a melodramatic baby gay for 30 minutes

565
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,090
of my lifetime please?

566
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:29,270
Is that alright with you, the gays?

567
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:32,060
So, to be honest, I still experience

568
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,790
comphet thoughts and fantasies.

569
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:35,660
Like, for a long time I've had what seem

570
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:38,780
to be romantic fantasies about marrying a man.

571
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:41,430
But after a lot of introspection I've realized

572
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:43,890
that this is not really a fantasy

573
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:46,520
of private happiness and fulfillment.

574
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:50,710
It's a fantasy of a social prestige and acceptance.

575
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:53,410
Like, can you imagine if I got married

576
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:57,750
to a tall, handsome man, at an opulent wedding

577
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:00,880
with lots of photographers posting to Instagram?

578
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,400
Ugh, I'd be queen of the trannies!

579
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,230
I'd be a super heckin valid uwu.

580
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:09,020
But I don't actually wanna be married, I wanna get married.

581
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,400
I wanna have a wedding.

582
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,120
Basically, I wanna wear a wedding dress.

583
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,720
I want attention, okay?

584
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,930
Please pay, pay attention to me.

585
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:19,380
So I can totally deconstruct the fantasy,

586
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:22,430
but it's still really hard for me to let it go.

587
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:26,160
I cling to the reassuring conformity of heterosexuality.

588
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,320
Because there's a level of gender instability

589
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,490
and deviancy that's inherent to homosexuality,

590
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:35,340
and until recently I wasn't secure enough

591
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,330
in my gender to handle that.

592
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:40,580
Lesbianism is a very advanced form of womanhood,

593
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,140
and I think I needed to go through

594
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,360
the more 101 straight girl experience

595
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,950
before attempting anything as difficult as that.

596
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:50,090
I still have a hard time imagining a happy future

597
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:52,940
for myself as a woman partnered to a woman,

598
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:53,970
and I think that's partly

599
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:58,200
because good lesbian representation in media is so sparse.

600
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,850
The best we have is a Showtime melodrama

601
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:03,970
from 15 years ago, which I do like

602
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,310
and I like the new one too.

603
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:07,730
But after that, the runner up is

604
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,350
maybe not the lesbian representation we need,

605
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:13,420
it's a YouTube show about two drag queens

606
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,590
whomst we ship.

607
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:16,380
Well, I don't ship them because I have

608
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,390
a fully lesbian parasocial Internet crush

609
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:19,730
on Katya Zamolodchikova.

610
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:20,720
Don't laugh at me!

611
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,100
She's smart, she's funny, she's beautiful,

612
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,490
that's everything I'm looking for in a woman.

613
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:28,420
Sure some haters and losers will probably try to convince me

614
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:31,510
that Katya is in fact a homosexual man posing as a woman

615
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:32,343
but you know what?

616
00:25:32,343 --> 00:25:34,830
This is a super fucking vulnerable moment in my life,

617
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:36,683
and I don't need this right now.

618
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,970
I need to be touched by a real woman.

619
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:42,820
I'm, I'm losing my goddamn mind.

620
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:45,490
It's so deeply embedded in our culture

621
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:48,050
that marrying a man is the end-goal of womanhood.

622
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:50,800
And it's not just Disney movies, like,

623
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:54,230
it's the Bible, it's Greek mythology,

624
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:56,660
German fairytales, Victorian novels.

625
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:59,270
The whole weight of cultural history is telling you

626
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:02,630
that what it means to succeed as a woman is to marry a man.

627
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:05,310
And if you're already super dysphoric and insecure

628
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:07,870
about your gender, then to reject

629
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:10,677
that possibility, ahhhh it hurts.

630
00:26:10,677 --> 00:26:11,870
It hurts so bad.

631
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:14,430
But whenever I think about having a long-term partner,

632
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:17,540
you know, not the wedding day, but the 1000th morning

633
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:22,430
waking up together, I can only imagine her being a woman.

634
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:25,750
My brain wants a good man to take care of me.

635
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:30,040
But my heart wants a high-maintenance diva to ruin my life.

636
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:34,290
And once I knew that for sure, I thought it would be wrong

637
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:35,640
to stay with Chad.

638
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:40,110
And this man was like my hinge, he was holding me together,

639
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:45,110
but last December I broke up with him

640
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:47,860
because I'm a lesbian,

641
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:51,423
which at least it's a good reason.

642
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:56,790
I'm having a hard time you guys.

643
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:58,560
Leave your pity in the comments.

644
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,480
And I'm starting to regret eating that fruit too,

645
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,528
I feel like shit.

646
00:27:01,528 --> 00:27:04,270
I think it's the loss of my immortal soul weighing on me.

647
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:06,900
I could really use a couple Advil and vodka tonic.

648
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,190
I think I might throw some clothes on too.

649
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,739
Where's that snake?

650
00:27:10,739 --> 00:27:13,489
♪ "Flower Duet" ♪

651
00:27:19,323 --> 00:27:22,850
Ugh, I already miss my heterosexual nails.

652
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:25,700
I know these are too long to be gay, but baby steps, okay.

653
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,670
This is hard for me.

654
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:28,980
Getting my acrylics removed? Traumatizing.

655
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,310
I feel like I'm detransitioning!

656
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:32,500
One of these days I will do the lesbian manicure

657
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,200
with acrylics on eight fingers.

658
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,137
I just have to find the courage to walk into the salon

659
00:27:36,137 --> 00:27:39,500
and say, "Hi, I'm a homosexual, please.

660
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,503
I want two short nails so I can fuck pussy."

661
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,010
Shame!

662
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:46,250
Let's talk about the shame.

663
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:50,300
Before I was transgendered, I really only dated women

664
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:54,183
though, two of those women later turned out to be trans so,

665
00:27:54,183 --> 00:27:56,320
I guess we had some way of finding each other.

666
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,830
And attraction to women was never really a problem

667
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:02,080
for me before the transgendering, because, I was raised

668
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,790
in an alternative lifestyle where men are supposed

669
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:05,910
to be attracted to women.

670
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:06,950
Crazy, I know.

671
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:09,100
Not that I'm a newcomer to shame, because,

672
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:12,610
oh, sweaty I was doing plenty of things

673
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:14,450
that men are not supposed to do.

674
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:16,500
And before I transitioned my shame was centered

675
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,930
around my being at the time a gender non-conforming man,

676
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:22,260
which in my early YouTube videos I dealt with

677
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:26,510
by caricaturing myself and basically leaning in

678
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:27,910
to the public humiliation.

679
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:29,640
One of my classic techniques.

680
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,370
But now, my shame is centered around my failure

681
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:34,340
to be a socially acceptable woman,

682
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,180
and the most glaring aspects

683
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:41,000
of that failure are my male past, my sexual orientation,

684
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,750
and the severed human heads in my refrigerator.

685
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:47,610
Killing all those people was not my most feminine moment,

686
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:51,620
but I was having a bad skin day, what was I supposed to do?

687
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:54,270
There's two problems that kind of multiply together.

688
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:56,550
One, I'm ashamed of being trans,

689
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,950
two, I'm ashamed of being a lesbian,

690
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:03,860
and whatever one times two is, I'm really ashamed

691
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:06,792
of being a trans lesbian.

692
00:29:06,792 --> 00:29:08,250
Ugh.

693
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:11,890
It's difficult and risky for me to admit these feelings

694
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:16,160
because visible queer people are supposed to perform pride.

695
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,180
Why is no one talking about the shame?

696
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:20,580
Because we're ashamed of the shame.

697
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,650
But we shouldn't be.

698
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:24,730
The shame is a natural result of shaming.

699
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:27,510
I grew up in a media era where trans women

700
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:30,700
were usually represented as vomit-inducing monstrosities

701
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,070
who deserve the violence they bring

702
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,600
upon themselves by existing.

703
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,410
And I started my transition in the first year

704
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:36,680
of the Trump administration,

705
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,520
when there's been constant vilification of trans people

706
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,720
in the press, invading women's bathrooms,

707
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,800
forcing our insanity on children,

708
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,720
destroying Western civilization

709
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,490
with our authoritarian pronouns!

710
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:50,650
It's hard to express just the daily humiliation

711
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:52,770
of being a trans woman under these conditions.

712
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:55,250
Then there's the little jabs people throw at you, like,

713
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:57,660
my laser technician recently told me,

714
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,700
"You must be very courageous to transition,

715
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,690
because that is not socially acceptable."

716
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:04,730
And then she went back to blasting laser beams

717
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:05,640
into my asshole.

718
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,620
And of course there's the Internet,

719
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:09,410
where, you know, I used to spend most of my life

720
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:10,900
before the sadness took over.

721
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,260
And I'm sure we all know that people

722
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:14,910
on the Internet are a wretched, wretched hoard

723
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,700
of bigoted attack helicopters.

724
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,970
The whole point of this channel is I try to talk sense

725
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:22,140
to these people, I talk to the TERFs and the conservatives

726
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,130
and I try to empathize with their point of view

727
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:25,950
and provide a rational response.

728
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:28,230
But a side effect of all that research is

729
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:31,280
I've acquired a burgeoning vocabulary of self-loathing.

730
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:34,490
It's seeped into my brain and become a part of me.

731
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:38,280
And this lifelong buildup of shame has become a wound

732
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,100
at the heart of my existence, and all I can really do

733
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:45,010
about it is compensate by wearing fancy clothes.

734
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:48,810
I may be trash, but I am majestic trash,

735
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:52,200
I am resplendent trash, I am couture trash!

736
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:56,970
And I just bought, a mid-century, gold-trimmed,

737
00:30:56,970 --> 00:31:00,040
Venetian blown-glass decanter, which helps me

738
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,710
forget the shame and self-loathing

739
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:03,260
that plagues my every moment.

740
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:06,240
Now, I'm guessing that a lot of people will be confused

741
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,680
about why I'm so ashamed of being gay,

742
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,100
when I've already come out

743
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,270
as trans, which seems like a bigger deal.

744
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,840
To paraphrase what some people have told me,

745
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,620
You're already a transgendered, and a freak's a freak,

746
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,340
so who cares what kind of freak?

747
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:21,150
Well first of all, I would like

748
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:23,660
to propose a sociological theory.

749
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:27,800
Tiffany's Law: all freaks have a deep psychological need

750
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,380
to feel superior to a different type of freak.

751
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:33,650
And trans lesbians are pretty close to the bottom of

752
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:34,630
that pecking order.

753
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:36,690
Who's even left for me to feel superior to,

754
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:38,130
the goddamn Belgians?

755
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:38,980
Fuck this waffle!

756
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:42,950
Second, coming out as trans wasn't as hard for me

757
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:45,690
because I did it incrementally over like eight years.

758
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:47,560
At first I was like well, I'm just a man

759
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,710
who wears makeup sometimes, and then I was, like actually

760
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:52,310
it's not just clothes and makeup

761
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:55,330
I'm pretty gender non-conforming in a lot of ways,

762
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,540
and then I realized, I'm not a man at all and I identified

763
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,600
as non-binary, and then I started taking hormones,

764
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,670
and two months on HRT I woke up one day

765
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:05,820
and said, It's fine I'm literally a woman.

766
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:08,670
So by the time I came out as a trans woman

767
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:12,090
that was actually a step up in terms of social acceptability

768
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:13,380
from where I was before.

769
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,700
When I was a genderqueer genderfuck I felt like

770
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,950
I didn't fit in anywhere.

771
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:20,030
Whereas when I started transitioning to female,

772
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:22,520
even though at first I had a lot of the same problems,

773
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:26,700
there was at least a goal in mind, some possible future

774
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:29,470
where I could lead a normal-ish life as a woman.

775
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:31,880
So the moment I started identifying as a woman

776
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,200
was the moment the comphet voice entered my head.

777
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,450
Sure I've never been very attracted to men before,

778
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:38,770
but maybe I'm attracted to them now.

779
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:39,780
I'm a woman, right?

780
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,370
I've always been a little bi curious

781
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:43,980
and there was that time I kissed a boy when I was drunk.

782
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,630
Maybe I can make this work.

783
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:48,160
Let's choose some boys to be attracted to and get

784
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,100
to started on this.

785
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,460
Of course I wasn't as self-aware as that.

786
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:54,530
My way of explaining it to myself was, I guess hormones

787
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:56,960
just magically changed my sexual orientation

788
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,590
to the socially acceptable one, that's super crazy!

789
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:02,490
Shut up you goddamn lesbo!

790
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:04,330
God there's so much pressure on trans women

791
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:06,440
to be extremely gender conforming.

792
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,900
And even more so if you're a representative

793
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:09,900
of the community.

794
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,810
You feel like you have to be a Stepford wife

795
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:14,460
or else cis people are gonna throw us all in camps.

796
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,540
And, early in my transition I kind of

797
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,360
worshiped straight trans women.

798
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:21,750
Like, I looked up to them and I wanted to be just like them.

799
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:24,640
Now back then there were a handful of trans lesbians

800
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,420
on YouTube trying to make the case to the masses

801
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:30,030
that being a trans lesbian is a legitimate thing,

802
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:33,650
but in 2017, sweaty, the masses were not having it.

803
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:35,580
I watched those women get eaten alive.

804
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,920
And as a result of my witnessing that

805
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,370
at a super fucking vulnerable moment for me,

806
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:44,340
I internalized the message that a trans lesbian is

807
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:47,700
just not an okay thing to be if you wanna be tolerated

808
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,880
or respected by anybody other than a handful of communists.

809
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,780
So I began my transition with essentially no role model

810
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:56,700
of a widely respected and admired trans lesbian.

811
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,830
And it doesn't help that most forms

812
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:01,580
of transphobia are harsher on gay trans women

813
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:02,973
than they are on straight trans women.

814
00:34:02,973 --> 00:34:05,590
Like take this trope that trans women are men

815
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:08,250
who transition to creep on women in bathrooms.

816
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:11,830
In response to that, it feels really good to be able to say,

817
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:13,150
"I'm not even attracted to women.

818
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:15,370
I'm just a petite heterosexual biogirl.

819
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:18,230
I'm surely not some kind of six foot monster

820
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,063
who likes women."

821
00:34:19,063 --> 00:34:21,440
Ugh, shame!

822
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,290
Shame!

823
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:24,150
It does make me feel like a monster sometimes,

824
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:26,460
like a mutant that has no place in society.

825
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:29,550
And this shame has actually made it more difficult for me

826
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:32,300
to accept that I'm a gay woman, than it was for me

827
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,230
to come out as trans in the first place.

828
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:36,770
It's like I made a kind of subconscious bargain

829
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:39,950
where I traded my sexual orientation for my gender identity.

830
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:41,740
So I finally transitioned only

831
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:43,040
to spend the next couple years

832
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,030
living with a different kind of denial.

833
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:48,390
And that denial got pretty deep and pretty dark.

834
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:51,090
This is painful and incriminating to admit,

835
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:54,170
but not all of my shame came from external bigotry.

836
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:57,480
Some of it came from my own judgment and disgust

837
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,530
toward things I saw trans lesbians doing.

838
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:02,980
Like this anime catgirl shit which clearly gets

839
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:05,190
under my skin, and not just because these people

840
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:06,970
have been harassing me for three years.

841
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:09,240
Like, you see it all over trans Twitter and Reddit,

842
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,920
this queasy combination of the hypersexual

843
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,050
and the infantile.

844
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:16,550
I'm a heckin' catgirl lesbian cumslut.

845
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:18,550
Meow meow girldick nya nya!

846
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:20,730
Here's the 97th picture of my own legs

847
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:22,330
in thigh-high stripey socks uwu.

848
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,740
What is that about?

849
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,400
Is this how women act?

850
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,410
Cis people are gonna see this!

851
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:30,110
They're not gonna let us into women's spaces

852
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:32,250
if we act like that!

853
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:35,180
Now, I'm not proud of having these judgmental feelings.

854
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:39,280
But I confess to periodically sinking into these morbid,

855
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,180
guilty binges of cringing at embarrassing trans lesbians.

856
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:45,200
And if I was a different type of YouTuber

857
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,100
I could've turned this into content.

858
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:50,530
At my worst, I would sit there telling another trans person,

859
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:53,360
Why are trans lesbians so cringey?

860
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,230
They're making things harder for the rest of us girls.

861
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:58,430
And that's the real darkness, isn't it?

862
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:01,830
Not even having the decency to openly despise yourself

863
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:03,170
like an honest American.

864
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:06,370
No, just sitting there in absurd denial of who you are

865
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:09,810
as a person, disparaging your own repressed identity

866
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:11,030
to anyone who will listen.

867
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:12,750
And I'm ashamed of that too.

868
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:14,440
I'm ashamed I sunk that low.

869
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,170
But all you can do is try to get better,

870
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:18,490
and I'm trying to get better.

871
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:20,210
I've broken free of the denial,

872
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:22,770
and now I have to break free of the shame.

873
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:26,200
Because shame is literally ruining my life.

874
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,980
I told Joanne I was working on a video about shame,

875
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,660
and she said I might wanna mention that one

876
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:34,230
of the reasons she didn't wanna be with me

877
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:37,650
is she'd be ashamed to date another trans woman.

878
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:39,700
She said she feels like relationships

879
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,520
between trans women are freakish behavior

880
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,950
on the outskirts of society with no attempt to integrate.

881
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:48,680
These are very painful words to hear from the woman you're

882
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,750
in love with.

883
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:52,620
But I understand why she feels that way.

884
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:55,820
Joanne gets validation from dating cis men or cis women,

885
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:58,770
but I can't be the hinge that connects her

886
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:00,170
to mainstream society.

887
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:02,200
And it's maddening to me that she feels that way,

888
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,610
because I would have chosen her over every cis woman

889
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:06,443
in the world.

890
00:37:06,443 --> 00:37:08,660
But I'm just another worthless freak without the authority

891
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:12,180
of society behind me, so my love doesn't count.

892
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,290
Shame!

893
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:14,840
It poisons the soul.

894
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,690
You know, who you love, just like what gender you are,

895
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:20,400
is such a basic part of your humanity.

896
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,770
And shame about that, cuts to the core of your being.

897
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:27,410
It's not I'm ashamed of what I did, it's not I'm ashamed of

898
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:31,870
how I feel, it's I'm ashamed of who and what I am.

899
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:35,532
And living in that state of mind is garbage.

900
00:37:35,532 --> 00:37:37,520
It's a basically hell.

901
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,330
Even after I realized my sexuality,

902
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:42,090
I considered just shoving that shit back down

903
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:43,700
and never coming out.

904
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,260
I have all these fears about it.

905
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:48,090
I'm worried people will take my gender less seriously,

906
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:50,590
I'm worried cis women, and straight women I'm friends with

907
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:52,850
will get weird about it, I'm worried I'll die

908
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:54,910
a lonely useless lesbian,

909
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:56,240
I should've just married a man

910
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,450
'cause at least then there'd be someone to kill the spiders

911
00:37:58,450 --> 00:37:59,780
and fix the fucking sink.

912
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:02,410
I'm worried I'll lose my straight male audience on YouTube.

913
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:04,560
Although, I mean, love you boys,

914
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,310
and please keep the attention coming

915
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:08,170
'cause I need all the validation I can get right now,

916
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:10,570
but, I will be fine without you.

917
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:13,260
And in any case, when has a woman's being a lesbian

918
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,760
ever stopped a man from taking a swing at it?

919
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,950
I actually thought about marrying a man anyway,

920
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:22,760
just sacrificing my sexual orientation to regain that safe,

921
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,460
comfortable, shameless feeling I used to have

922
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:28,220
when walking down the street holding Chad's hand

923
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:30,410
feeling like I'd succeeded as a woman.

924
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:32,390
But if I don't deal with this now and work

925
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:34,860
towards accepting myself, then I'm just gonna be

926
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,960
in the same situation in ten years,

927
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,960
when I'm 41-years-old and married to a man

928
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,630
and having these same feelings.

929
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:42,730
So it's time for this to stop, because literally

930
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:46,070
the only good thing about being gay is doing gay shit.

931
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:48,390
And as long as I'm ashamed of my sexuality,

932
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:50,270
no one's gonna wanna do gay shit with me.

933
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:53,140
As I like to say, if you can't love yourself,

934
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,280
how in the hell you gonna prop up

935
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,760
your narcissistic delusions?

936
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,320
Look, I'm trying to stay positive.

937
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:00,510
Maybe everyone hates trans lesbians now, but just you wait.

938
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:02,100
We all know how trends work.

939
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:05,900
In 10 years being a trans lesbian will be the coolest,

940
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:09,030
hippest, chicest thing imaginable, and all the people

941
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:11,880
who talk shit now will forget they ever said a word.

942
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,960
That's right, even the straight trans girls

943
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,450
will be making out with each other just for the clout,

944
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:18,940
like, "We can be lesbians too!

945
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,090
We're edgy!"

946
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:21,890
Oh, it's gonna be Madonna and Britney

947
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:25,460
at the 2003 VMAs all over again, mark my words.

948
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:29,010
And among cis lesbians, oh, it will actually be a sign

949
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:31,503
of prestige to have a trap waifu.

950
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,170
I can dream right?

951
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:37,660
One you've tasted one forbidden fruit, why stop there?

952
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:41,077
(electronic music)

953
00:40:16,322 --> 00:40:19,905
(dreamy piano music)
