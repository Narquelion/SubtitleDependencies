(upbeat electronic music) - Hey guys, it's Natalie,

11
00:00:38,258 --> 00:00:39,844
welcome back to my channel.

12
00:00:39,844 --> 00:00:42,614
Today I'm gonna do a makeup tutorial, as always,

13
00:00:42,614 --> 00:00:45,853
but first, story time, story time, story time!

14
00:00:45,853 --> 00:00:47,419
I just wanna be upfront with you guys

15
00:00:47,419 --> 00:00:50,068
and let you know that I've had some facial surgery.

16
00:00:50,068 --> 00:00:51,401
I'm always gonna be honest with you guys

17
00:00:51,401 --> 00:00:54,480
about this kind of thing because you mean so much to me.

18
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,741
Like you've been here with me since the beginning,

19
00:00:56,741 --> 00:00:59,025
and you've seen my story, my whole entire journey,

20
00:00:59,025 --> 00:01:01,408
this journey I've been on as a transgender woman.

21
00:01:01,408 --> 00:01:02,929
You've been with me on this whole journey.

22
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:03,935
This is my truth,

23
00:01:03,935 --> 00:01:05,373
and you've accepted the truth of my journey.

24
00:01:05,373 --> 00:01:06,969
This is a really vulnerable moment for me,

25
00:01:06,969 --> 00:01:08,351
and you guys are just so special

26
00:01:08,351 --> 00:01:09,380
because you've been here for me

27
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:10,463
throughout my whole transgender journey.

28
00:01:10,463 --> 00:01:11,996
The whole message of my journey as an influencer

29
00:01:11,996 --> 00:01:15,829
(Natalie's voice overlapping)

30
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:21,543
Ah! of the lived experience

31
00:01:21,543 --> 00:01:22,668
of my transgender journey

32
00:01:22,668 --> 00:01:23,951
(tense music) as a YouTube influencer

33
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:25,034
and it's been so meaningful,

34
00:01:25,034 --> 00:01:26,825
and I'm going a really vulnerable time for me,

35
00:01:26,825 --> 00:01:28,408
and I've been so grateful to you guys

36
00:01:28,408 --> 00:01:30,284
(Natalie's speech blending together)

37
00:01:30,284 --> 00:01:31,875
I think the main thing we've learned together

38
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:33,876
on this channel is that makeup is a lot of fun,

39
00:01:33,876 --> 00:01:36,259
but it's inner beauty that really counts.

40
00:01:36,259 --> 00:01:38,263
Anyway, let's talk about plastic surgery.

41
00:01:38,263 --> 00:01:40,972
I had facial feminization surgery on April 2nd,

42
00:01:40,972 --> 00:01:42,542
so about a month and a half ago.

43
00:01:42,542 --> 00:01:45,262
What we call facial feminization surgery, or FFS,

44
00:01:45,262 --> 00:01:47,438
is actually a series of different procedures

45
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:49,380
that some transgender women choose to have

46
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,672
to look more feminine.

47
00:01:50,672 --> 00:01:53,953
So what I had done is forehead contouring, a brow lift,

48
00:01:53,953 --> 00:01:57,459
rhinoplasty, mandible contouring, a trachea shave.

49
00:01:57,459 --> 00:01:58,292
You know, what, let's just have

50
00:01:58,292 --> 00:02:00,194
the skull lady talk you through it.

51
00:02:00,194 --> 00:02:01,869
(regal classical music) - A coronal incision

52
00:02:01,869 --> 00:02:04,738
was made athwart the cranial vault,

53
00:02:04,738 --> 00:02:06,959
whence the skin of the forehead

54
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:09,422
was stripped away from the bone.

55
00:02:09,422 --> 00:02:12,928
A fragment of the supraorbital ridge was then

56
00:02:12,928 --> 00:02:17,220
chiseled away, removed, reshaped, and re-affixed,

57
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,170
thereby eliminating that undesirable prominence

58
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:23,638
of a robust brow that ofttimes

59
00:02:23,638 --> 00:02:26,992
distinguisheth the skull of the Chad.

60
00:02:26,992 --> 00:02:30,188
A second incision was then made athwart the columella

61
00:02:30,188 --> 00:02:33,879
of the nasal septum, facilitating a reconstruction

62
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:37,241
of the interior cartilage and bone.

63
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:41,783
Further incisions were made betwixt the gum and cheek,

64
00:02:41,783 --> 00:02:45,099
through which the mandible was rasped and shaved

65
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:49,946
down to a gracile curvature of a jaw and pointed chin,

66
00:02:49,946 --> 00:02:52,761
thereby delineating a facial silhouette

67
00:02:52,761 --> 00:02:56,861
exhibiting that aspect which medical men call cunty.

68
00:02:56,861 --> 00:02:58,020
- It all sounds pretty gruesome

69
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,452
when you describe it like that,

70
00:02:59,452 --> 00:03:00,887
but there's actually a very fine level

71
00:03:00,887 --> 00:03:03,003
of technique and aesthetics involved.

72
00:03:03,003 --> 00:03:04,336
(classical music) My plastic surgeon

73
00:03:04,336 --> 00:03:05,338
is an artist.

74
00:03:05,338 --> 00:03:06,920
The results are natural, I don't look

75
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,205
like I've had a bunch of work done, which is good.

76
00:03:09,205 --> 00:03:10,923
You know, you at least wanna leave people wondering,

77
00:03:10,923 --> 00:03:12,259
(upbeat electronic music) maybe she's born with it,

78
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:13,729
maybe a surgeon peeled her face off

79
00:03:13,729 --> 00:03:15,130
and fixed her shitty skull.

80
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,368
Here's a before and after picture

81
00:03:16,368 --> 00:03:17,857
where you can clearly see the difference:

82
00:03:17,857 --> 00:03:19,532
to use the exact medical terminology,

83
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:22,276
my brow is on fleek, my nose is no longer busted the house,

84
00:03:22,276 --> 00:03:24,980
my jaw is snatched, and my Adam's apple is canceled.

85
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,866
Wasn't it always really Eve's apple?

86
00:03:26,866 --> 00:03:27,903
Maybe Satan's apple.

87
00:03:27,903 --> 00:03:30,850
I think I still look like myself, it's not a new face.

88
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:32,963
We're talking about millimeters of bone here.

89
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:35,012
But to have all that done was, well,

90
00:03:35,012 --> 00:03:37,722
it cost a lot of money, the anticipation was,

91
00:03:37,722 --> 00:03:42,170
oh, terror like I've never known, the pain was memorable,

92
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:44,066
and the recovery took more than a month.

93
00:03:44,066 --> 00:03:46,373
In fact, I still have some swelling in my jowls.

94
00:03:46,373 --> 00:03:47,431
(lighthearted music) Jowls, there's a nice

95
00:03:47,431 --> 00:03:49,326
feminine-sounding word, love that.

96
00:03:49,326 --> 00:03:51,276
The standard YouTube T-girl thing to do of course

97
00:03:51,276 --> 00:03:53,051
would have been to vlog the whole journey.

98
00:03:53,051 --> 00:03:54,009
(energetic music) Story time,

99
00:03:54,009 --> 00:03:56,720
my facial surgery experience, my FFS journey,

100
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,854
and post constant social media updates about it.

101
00:03:58,854 --> 00:04:01,278
And I am grateful to the trans women who have done that

102
00:04:01,278 --> 00:04:03,274
because it was really helpful to me

103
00:04:03,274 --> 00:04:05,375
to be able to watch those vlogs in advance

104
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,226
and know what I was getting myself into.

105
00:04:07,226 --> 00:04:09,308
But I decided not to post about the surgery

106
00:04:09,308 --> 00:04:11,597
because I wanted privacy for the recovery

107
00:04:11,597 --> 00:04:13,889
and to just take some time to get to feel at home

108
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:15,952
with the results before subjecting myself

109
00:04:15,952 --> 00:04:18,610
to the vicious things they say about me in the tabloids.

110
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:19,535
You know, I think I've been

111
00:04:19,535 --> 00:04:22,251
kinda psychologically damaged by reading for years

112
00:04:22,251 --> 00:04:24,618
the things people say about my appearance online.

113
00:04:24,618 --> 00:04:26,391
And I'm not even talking about the haters,

114
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,734
like at this point I can mostly brush them off.

115
00:04:28,734 --> 00:04:30,113
But for instance, about a year ago,

116
00:04:30,113 --> 00:04:32,011
I was reading through a transgender subreddit,

117
00:04:32,011 --> 00:04:34,527
and some trans woman was agonizing about her appearance,

118
00:04:34,527 --> 00:04:36,353
and someone offered the encouragement,

119
00:04:36,353 --> 00:04:37,186
(lighthearted music) "You know,

120
00:04:37,186 --> 00:04:39,728
"you can still look hot even if you don't pass,

121
00:04:39,728 --> 00:04:41,282
"just look at ContraPoints."

122
00:04:41,282 --> 00:04:42,170
(glass shattering) (melancholy music)

123
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:44,233
Ugh, like a dagger to the heart,

124
00:04:44,233 --> 00:04:45,992
the unintentional shade of it all.

125
00:04:45,992 --> 00:04:47,712
(whining)

126
00:04:47,712 --> 00:04:49,856
So the past six weeks have been at times

127
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:51,987
difficult and lonely, but I did manage

128
00:04:51,987 --> 00:04:54,648
to keep my mug off social media for long enough

129
00:04:54,648 --> 00:04:56,444
that I'm as ready as I'm ever gonna be

130
00:04:56,444 --> 00:04:58,505
for the commentary of the Internet.

131
00:04:58,505 --> 00:04:59,344
(triumphant band music) So bring it on

132
00:04:59,344 --> 00:05:02,835
you jackals, you vultures, you goblin swine.

133
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:05,018
While I was lying around bandaged and bored,

134
00:05:05,018 --> 00:05:06,611
I did have a lot of time to think.

135
00:05:06,611 --> 00:05:08,770
And what I've been thinking about is probably

136
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,686
the same thing you're wondering right now,

137
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:14,515
which is, why would someone do what I just did?

138
00:05:14,515 --> 00:05:16,667
Why would I spend so much time and money

139
00:05:16,667 --> 00:05:18,843
and go through so much anxiety and pain

140
00:05:18,843 --> 00:05:21,659
just to change a few millimeters of bone?

141
00:05:21,659 --> 00:05:23,719
Isn't this all just extravagant vanity,

142
00:05:23,719 --> 00:05:26,817
some narcissistic symptom of phones but too much?

143
00:05:26,817 --> 00:05:28,349
Well, I feel like there's a lot of pressure on me

144
00:05:28,349 --> 00:05:31,377
to say that in fact, this wasn't cosmetic surgery at all.

145
00:05:31,377 --> 00:05:32,985
Usually trans people say that surgeries

146
00:05:32,985 --> 00:05:35,150
like facial feminization, top surgery,

147
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,892
genital reassignment, and so on

148
00:05:36,892 --> 00:05:40,094
serve the sole purpose of alleviating gender dysphoria,

149
00:05:40,094 --> 00:05:42,465
this discomfort that we feel with the mismatch

150
00:05:42,465 --> 00:05:44,604
between our bodies and our gender identity.

151
00:05:44,604 --> 00:05:46,530
So what I'm supposed to say is that my surgery

152
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:49,567
was a medically necessary reconstructive procedure

153
00:05:49,567 --> 00:05:52,861
needed to make my testosterone-weathered facial bones

154
00:05:52,861 --> 00:05:54,050
(lighthearted music) match the 5'2"

155
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:56,727
happy baby bouncy biogirl I truly am inside,

156
00:05:56,727 --> 00:05:58,739
thereby alleviating my dysphoria,

157
00:05:58,739 --> 00:06:00,845
helping me safely blend into society,

158
00:06:00,845 --> 00:06:03,426
and preventing a five-alarm psychiatric meltdown.

159
00:06:03,426 --> 00:06:05,218
And there is definitely truth to that.

160
00:06:05,218 --> 00:06:06,972
It's certainly the argument I intend to make

161
00:06:06,972 --> 00:06:09,762
when I write this off as a medical expense on my taxes.

162
00:06:09,762 --> 00:06:12,543
If you're an IRS auditor, please stop this video now

163
00:06:12,543 --> 00:06:13,626
(Windows error ding) and insert the next

164
00:06:13,626 --> 00:06:15,355
floppy disk into your CD drive.

165
00:06:15,355 --> 00:06:16,188
(disc jamming)

166
00:06:16,188 --> 00:06:18,487
But hypothetically speaking, I think the reality

167
00:06:18,487 --> 00:06:20,193
might not be quite so simple.

168
00:06:20,193 --> 00:06:22,692
How sharp is the line separating gender dysphoria

169
00:06:22,692 --> 00:06:24,740
from the other kinds of body image dysphoria

170
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,408
that drive cisgender people to get

171
00:06:26,408 --> 00:06:28,227
cosmetic surgery all the time?

172
00:06:28,227 --> 00:06:30,210
Last year, when I used to foolishly tweet

173
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:33,609
things of substance, I tweeted that I wanted to get FFS,

174
00:06:33,609 --> 00:06:35,193
and some trans people responded

175
00:06:35,193 --> 00:06:36,475
telling me that I was suffering

176
00:06:36,475 --> 00:06:39,041
from internalized transphobia and self-loathing.

177
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:40,698
They compared it to East Asian people

178
00:06:40,698 --> 00:06:42,181
getting double eyelid surgery,

179
00:06:42,181 --> 00:06:44,097
or so-called ethnic rhinoplasty,

180
00:06:44,097 --> 00:06:45,202
which they say are motivated

181
00:06:45,202 --> 00:06:48,144
by internalized racism and Western beauty standards.

182
00:06:48,144 --> 00:06:49,894
I think that's a pretty weak analogy,

183
00:06:49,894 --> 00:06:52,132
and telling a trans person to just learn to accept

184
00:06:52,132 --> 00:06:55,208
the way they look can actually be kind of transphobic

185
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:57,723
because a big part of what it even means to be trans,

186
00:06:57,723 --> 00:07:00,646
at least for me, is the desire to look more female.

187
00:07:00,646 --> 00:07:03,095
But I also think that trans people often talk

188
00:07:03,095 --> 00:07:06,730
like gender dysphoria is this intrinsic, personal experience

189
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:10,419
that's always 100% valid and never has anything at all to do

190
00:07:10,419 --> 00:07:12,782
with the external pressure of beauty standards.

191
00:07:12,782 --> 00:07:16,150
But in fact, gender dysphoria is not sealed away in a vacuum

192
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:18,982
away from the influence of societal ideals and norms.

193
00:07:18,982 --> 00:07:21,378
Early in my transition, some of my worst dysphoria

194
00:07:21,378 --> 00:07:24,642
was about body hair, so I had full-body laser hair removal,

195
00:07:24,642 --> 00:07:25,779
and now I'm smoother

196
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,567
(chimes ringing) than a cisgender boiled egg.

197
00:07:27,567 --> 00:07:28,890
But where is the idea that women

198
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:30,496
don't have body hair come from?

199
00:07:30,496 --> 00:07:32,767
Isn't that just an arbitrary grooming custom?

200
00:07:32,767 --> 00:07:33,935
A lot of the cis women I know

201
00:07:33,935 --> 00:07:35,813
don't so much as shave their legs,

202
00:07:35,813 --> 00:07:38,769
so maybe I'm not even trying to look like a cis woman.

203
00:07:38,769 --> 00:07:41,230
Maybe I'm simply doing everything I can

204
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,896
to avoid looking like the caricature

205
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:48,083
of a knuckly, hairy, burgeoning, mannish trans woman

206
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:51,082
with which society has terrorized me to my core.

207
00:07:51,082 --> 00:07:55,157
Is this gender dysphoria or is it internalized transphobia,

208
00:07:55,157 --> 00:07:57,710
or is it simply a cosmetic preference?

209
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,545
When I try to psychoanalyze myself,

210
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:02,083
I find that my desires to look female,

211
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:04,364
to look feminine, and to look beautiful

212
00:08:04,364 --> 00:08:07,214
are not exactly the same, but they're woven together

213
00:08:07,214 --> 00:08:10,603
so tightly that it's kind of difficult to untangle them.

214
00:08:10,603 --> 00:08:12,560
And the opposite is also true,

215
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,262
that for me feeling mannish or dysphoric

216
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:17,659
usually goes along with feeling ugly.

217
00:08:17,659 --> 00:08:18,768
I don't have a lot of days

218
00:08:18,768 --> 00:08:20,413
where I walk out the house thinking,

219
00:08:20,413 --> 00:08:22,110
"Well, I'm giving femme queen realness,

220
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:24,397
"but apart from that I look like absolute shit."

221
00:08:24,397 --> 00:08:26,725
Of course, there are qualities that make you look female

222
00:08:26,725 --> 00:08:28,595
that aren't necessarily attractive,

223
00:08:28,595 --> 00:08:31,976
like cellulite or flabby arms, which are super fish

224
00:08:31,976 --> 00:08:33,946
but aren't deemed beautiful by society.

225
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:36,388
The truth is I don't just want to look female.

226
00:08:36,388 --> 00:08:40,652
I want to be beautiful, desperately, god I'll do anything.

227
00:08:40,652 --> 00:08:42,765
(ominous music) Anything.

228
00:08:42,765 --> 00:08:43,947
In this video, I want to explore

229
00:08:43,947 --> 00:08:46,190
why I'm so obsessed with being beautiful

230
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:47,922
and why it seems like a lot of people

231
00:08:47,922 --> 00:08:49,092
(ominous music) who live in a society

232
00:08:49,092 --> 00:08:50,329
are so obsessed.

233
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:51,804
(tense music) Is it phones?

234
00:08:51,804 --> 00:08:53,258
It's probably phones.

235
00:08:53,258 --> 00:08:54,323
I know you're supposed to pretend

236
00:08:54,323 --> 00:08:55,810
that you don't care about being beautiful

237
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:57,353
or that you're not trying, but

238
00:08:57,353 --> 00:08:58,344
(tense music) guys it's the only thing

239
00:08:58,344 --> 00:09:00,187
I care about and I've never tried so hard at anything.

240
00:09:00,187 --> 00:09:03,009
Of course I do feel guilty about being so obsessed with it,

241
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,170
'cause there's this idea that caring about beauty

242
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,061
makes you shallow or vain.

243
00:09:07,061 --> 00:09:10,122
You know, "smart people" aren't supposed to care about beauty.

244
00:09:10,122 --> 00:09:11,233
And I've always been categorized

245
00:09:11,233 --> 00:09:13,620
as a "smart person" by people around me.

246
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,586
Some of that is when you're raised like I was,

247
00:09:15,586 --> 00:09:18,199
as a middle-class white boy with no athletic talent,

248
00:09:18,199 --> 00:09:19,868
parents and teachers treat you

249
00:09:19,868 --> 00:09:21,509
("Pomp and Circumstance") like a f*cking genius,

250
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:24,154
like Einstein nutted a load in Mozart's bussy

251
00:09:24,154 --> 00:09:26,088
and Mozart sh*t you out while he was getting

252
00:09:26,088 --> 00:09:28,353
a rusty trombone from Vincent van Gogh.

253
00:09:28,353 --> 00:09:30,919
It inspired his famous painting Starfish Night.

254
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:32,048
But even among women,

255
00:09:32,048 --> 00:09:34,181
caring about beauty is often frowned upon.

256
00:09:34,181 --> 00:09:35,742
I feel like an alien species

257
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,742
when I hang out with women in academia,

258
00:09:37,742 --> 00:09:40,074
and I know a few 'cause I once got half a PhD

259
00:09:40,074 --> 00:09:42,452
before dropping out to become a uh,

260
00:09:42,452 --> 00:09:44,439
what do you call someone who makes videos?

261
00:09:44,439 --> 00:09:45,272
A camgirl.

262
00:09:45,272 --> 00:09:47,276
Most female grad students and professors I know

263
00:09:47,276 --> 00:09:48,328
don't wear makeup.

264
00:09:48,328 --> 00:09:50,072
To them, the idea of earnestly putting on

265
00:09:50,072 --> 00:09:53,150
press-on nails or false eyelashes is inconceivable,

266
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,577
like maybe on Halloween.

267
00:09:54,577 --> 00:09:57,189
Now part of that is that women in male-dominated fields

268
00:09:57,189 --> 00:09:59,366
sometimes feel like they have to present more masculine

269
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:01,821
to be taken seriously because of this prejudice

270
00:10:01,821 --> 00:10:04,712
that beautified femininity equals frivolous.

271
00:10:04,712 --> 00:10:05,837
But another part of it is clearly

272
00:10:05,837 --> 00:10:08,183
some kind of not-like-other-girls weird flex.

273
00:10:08,183 --> 00:10:11,876
Which, OK, fine, whatever, I'm not gonna judge another woman

274
00:10:11,876 --> 00:10:13,741
for the way she copes with a society

275
00:10:13,741 --> 00:10:15,389
that pressures women to be beautiful

276
00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:18,287
while simultaneously belittling them for caring about it.

277
00:10:18,287 --> 00:10:20,490
I guess my way of coping is this tacky,

278
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:23,301
heteronormative, and tragically sincere aspiration

279
00:10:23,301 --> 00:10:26,076
to some kind of post-ironic feminine beauty.

280
00:10:26,076 --> 00:10:27,386
Why am I like this?

281
00:10:27,386 --> 00:10:29,643
Well part of it is vindictive transsexualism,

282
00:10:29,643 --> 00:10:30,653
pure and simple.

283
00:10:30,653 --> 00:10:32,295
To all the people who've called me a man,

284
00:10:32,295 --> 00:10:34,494
I wanna say, "F*ck you," by looking

285
00:10:34,494 --> 00:10:37,364
like the undeniable visual archetype of a woman,

286
00:10:37,364 --> 00:10:40,733
which is a beautiful feminine woman

287
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:43,731
who's wearing 600,000 sequins. (laughs)

288
00:10:43,731 --> 00:10:47,343
(sequins scratching) They're biological sequins.

289
00:10:47,343 --> 00:10:48,525
(peaceful instrumental music)

290
00:10:48,525 --> 00:10:52,775
Ooh, that is some ASMR right there, listen to that.

291
00:11:02,798 --> 00:11:05,082
Another factor is this sh*tty website.

292
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:07,606
I'm a professional YouTube influencer,

293
00:11:07,606 --> 00:11:10,414
forgive me father, and I'm on camera all the time.

294
00:11:10,414 --> 00:11:12,177
I edit my own videos, so I spend upwards

295
00:11:12,177 --> 00:11:15,865
of 60 hours a month staring at my own face on a screen.

296
00:11:15,865 --> 00:11:17,312
Now you try doing that and see

297
00:11:17,312 --> 00:11:19,396
what kind of f*cked up complex you develop.

298
00:11:19,396 --> 00:11:22,467
Plus, I compare myself to other women who make videos.

299
00:11:22,467 --> 00:11:23,926
A lot of the trans women on YouTube

300
00:11:23,926 --> 00:11:27,184
are so young and so beautiful it makes me want to throw up.

301
00:11:27,184 --> 00:11:28,830
And in comparison, for a long time,

302
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:32,927
I've felt like this shabby aging transvestite,

303
00:11:32,927 --> 00:11:34,721
just this feral cat,

304
00:11:34,721 --> 00:11:36,827
wandering the aisles of the liquor store.

305
00:11:36,827 --> 00:11:39,663
So I'm insecure, I'm compensating for that whole mess,

306
00:11:39,663 --> 00:11:42,442
but I honestly don't resent the beautiful people,

307
00:11:42,442 --> 00:11:44,566
I really just stan the hell out of them.

308
00:11:44,566 --> 00:11:45,606
(ominous music) I follow this woman

309
00:11:45,606 --> 00:11:47,654
on YouTube, and I want to be just like her mom.

310
00:11:47,654 --> 00:11:48,612
("God Save the Queen") Her name

311
00:11:48,612 --> 00:11:50,161
is Dame Jefferson Star.

312
00:11:50,161 --> 00:11:51,983
Her name is Lady Jane Maclean.

313
00:11:51,983 --> 00:11:54,603
Signora Nicole Beatrice Tutorials.

314
00:11:54,603 --> 00:11:56,825
Tatiana Petrovna Westbrookova.

315
00:11:56,825 --> 00:11:57,783
(tense music) And of course my queen

316
00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:59,226
and perfect goddess whomst I stan

317
00:11:59,226 --> 00:12:01,254
and whose portrait I've painted hundreds of times.

318
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:03,376
So there's maybe some extra intensity for me,

319
00:12:03,376 --> 00:12:04,972
but I think it's actually pretty normal

320
00:12:04,972 --> 00:12:06,185
to want to be beautiful.

321
00:12:06,185 --> 00:12:07,986
I think even grad students want to be beautiful.

322
00:12:07,986 --> 00:12:10,247
They just wanna do it in that Becky kind of way

323
00:12:10,247 --> 00:12:12,500
where you scoff at anything glam or artificial.

324
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,903
And it's not just women who care about beauty either.

325
00:12:14,903 --> 00:12:16,334
I mean, gay men in LA have always

326
00:12:16,334 --> 00:12:17,701
been getting cosmetic surgery,

327
00:12:17,701 --> 00:12:19,502
but now even the straights are doing it.

328
00:12:19,502 --> 00:12:21,262
Incels are completely obsessed

329
00:12:21,262 --> 00:12:23,408
with the defects of their personal appearance,

330
00:12:23,408 --> 00:12:25,181
and the ones that aren't completely backpilled

331
00:12:25,181 --> 00:12:26,948
are obsessed with plastic surgery.

332
00:12:26,948 --> 00:12:30,095
The incel newspeak word for beauty is looksmaxing

333
00:12:30,095 --> 00:12:31,715
because of course they have to go about this

334
00:12:31,715 --> 00:12:33,529
in the most heterosexual possible way.

335
00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:34,737
(intense rock music) It is imperative to implement

336
00:12:34,737 --> 00:12:36,668
a skinmax regimen in order to maximize

337
00:12:36,668 --> 00:12:39,266
LooksMoneyStatus and secure access to females.

338
00:12:39,266 --> 00:12:40,561
Oh my god, calm down.

339
00:12:40,561 --> 00:12:41,921
Not every sentence out of your mouth

340
00:12:41,921 --> 00:12:44,608
has to be worded like a dispatch to the police commissioner.

341
00:12:44,608 --> 00:12:47,964
Yes, they actually call skincare skinmaxing.

342
00:12:47,964 --> 00:12:49,877
James Charles, I know you're having a hard month,

343
00:12:49,877 --> 00:12:51,174
but I've got a business idea

344
00:12:51,174 --> 00:12:53,025
that's gonna turn this thing around for you.

345
00:12:53,025 --> 00:12:54,452
Here's the plan, you're gonna create

346
00:12:54,452 --> 00:12:56,492
a new line of skincare products called

347
00:12:56,492 --> 00:12:58,036
(chimes ringing) Chad Glow.

348
00:12:58,036 --> 00:12:59,466
Bribe PewdiePie to send his fans

349
00:12:59,466 --> 00:13:01,924
to the promo video, hi sistercels,

350
00:13:01,924 --> 00:13:04,118
and send me a check in the mail, you're welcome.

351
00:13:04,118 --> 00:13:06,747
If you read looksmax forums, they're filled with discussions

352
00:13:06,747 --> 00:13:10,563
of browridge implants, chin implants, mandible implants.

353
00:13:10,563 --> 00:13:12,534
(regal classical music) - It must needs be remarked

354
00:13:12,534 --> 00:13:17,534
that the skull of the Chad exhibiteth a jawbone most robust.

355
00:13:18,511 --> 00:13:21,325
- It's literally facial masculinization surgery.

356
00:13:21,325 --> 00:13:23,284
So everyone's obsessed with the bones,

357
00:13:23,284 --> 00:13:24,908
everyone's obsessed with beauty,

358
00:13:24,908 --> 00:13:29,087
whether man or woman, cis or trans, gay or gamer.

359
00:13:29,087 --> 00:13:31,377
Maybe lesbians are just straight chillin'

360
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:33,553
while everyone else has completely lost their minds.

361
00:13:33,553 --> 00:13:35,915
But why, why do we care so much?

362
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:37,857
Well with incels, by their account

363
00:13:37,857 --> 00:13:39,888
the only reason they care is they think

364
00:13:39,888 --> 00:13:42,805
that looksmaxing will make femoids have sex with them,

365
00:13:42,805 --> 00:13:45,432
and they think that will make their lives feel meaningful,

366
00:13:45,432 --> 00:13:47,349
which, um, it will not.

367
00:13:48,316 --> 00:13:49,911
So incels are canceled.

368
00:13:49,911 --> 00:13:52,478
Now what about women, what's our deal, what's our sitch,

369
00:13:52,478 --> 00:13:53,898
what's our vibe, what's our vish?

370
00:13:53,898 --> 00:13:56,844
Well men seem to think that women are like inverted incels,

371
00:13:56,844 --> 00:13:58,983
that we care about beauty and wear makeup,

372
00:13:58,983 --> 00:13:59,816
(tense music) fakeup,

373
00:13:59,816 --> 00:14:01,740
because we're trying to attract men.

374
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,637
My daddy dom went on Vice News last year

375
00:14:03,637 --> 00:14:05,724
and said that women wear makeup because they're trying

376
00:14:05,724 --> 00:14:09,227
to stimulate male sexual arousal and because evolution.

377
00:14:09,227 --> 00:14:10,743
Now at the risk of being bratty,

378
00:14:10,743 --> 00:14:14,577
I gotta say this is maybe 10% true and 90% false.

379
00:14:14,577 --> 00:14:16,997
For one thing, straight men don't like makeup,

380
00:14:16,997 --> 00:14:18,316
at least they don't think they do.

381
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:19,687
Here's a chart I made illustrating

382
00:14:19,687 --> 00:14:22,298
what every straight man in the world thinks about makeup.

383
00:14:22,298 --> 00:14:23,929
Yes, I asked all of them.

384
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:26,684
If you wear no makeup, they think you look diseased.

385
00:14:26,684 --> 00:14:27,828
And I actually do look diseased

386
00:14:27,828 --> 00:14:29,526
when I don't wear makeup, so fair enough.

387
00:14:29,526 --> 00:14:30,976
If you wear natural makeup, you know

388
00:14:30,976 --> 00:14:33,967
a little concealer, mascara, maybe a nude lip,

389
00:14:33,967 --> 00:14:36,400
they think you're not wearing any makeup and they like it.

390
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,547
If you wear campy makeup, colorful eyeshadow,

391
00:14:38,547 --> 00:14:40,452
heavy contouring, overdrawn lips,

392
00:14:40,452 --> 00:14:41,979
they think it's dumb and they hate it.

393
00:14:41,979 --> 00:14:45,466
Of course I'm generalizing, #NotAllDaddyDoms.

394
00:14:45,466 --> 00:14:47,952
But if women really wore makeup to attract men,

395
00:14:47,952 --> 00:14:49,888
they you'd expect that they'd stop wearing it

396
00:14:49,888 --> 00:14:52,828
when there are no men around, but that doesn't happen.

397
00:14:52,828 --> 00:14:55,066
About a month ago, there was that video going around

398
00:14:55,066 --> 00:14:57,516
of a woman showing how to make jailhouse makeup,

399
00:14:57,516 --> 00:15:00,339
mixing deodorant and magazine ink to make eyeshadow,

400
00:15:00,339 --> 00:15:02,798
using Kool-Aid and Vaseline to make lipstick.

401
00:15:02,798 --> 00:15:04,881
There's not a lot of men in women's prison,

402
00:15:04,881 --> 00:15:06,975
but women are still performing incredible feats

403
00:15:06,975 --> 00:15:10,091
of ingenuity and resourcefulness just to wear makeup.

404
00:15:10,091 --> 00:15:12,761
So maybe women are using makeup to express

405
00:15:12,761 --> 00:15:15,370
their individuality and femininity, you know,

406
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:17,937
things that prison tries to take away from you,

407
00:15:17,937 --> 00:15:18,924
kinda makes sense.

408
00:15:18,924 --> 00:15:20,688
There's a Refinery29 documentary

409
00:15:20,688 --> 00:15:22,427
about prison cosmetology,

410
00:15:22,427 --> 00:15:24,398
and also sexual exploitation, yikes,

411
00:15:24,398 --> 00:15:25,790
in which a former inmate describes

412
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,829
how women would engage in sexual bartering

413
00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:29,814
with male guards just to get makeup.

414
00:15:29,814 --> 00:15:33,191
- If a girl's performing sexual favors for an officer,

415
00:15:33,191 --> 00:15:35,845
he would bring her in colored pencils,

416
00:15:35,845 --> 00:15:37,538
lip gloss, things like that.

417
00:15:37,538 --> 00:15:39,029
- That's right, women are sucking dick

418
00:15:39,029 --> 00:15:42,057
so they can put on makeup, not the other way around.

419
00:15:42,057 --> 00:15:44,923
Honestly, if all the men died tomorrow, F,

420
00:15:44,923 --> 00:15:46,830
I'd definitely keep wearing makeup.

421
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:47,961
In fact, I might wear more.

422
00:15:47,961 --> 00:15:49,268
And I'm not just saying that 'cause I'm trying

423
00:15:49,268 --> 00:15:50,957
to win feminist points or anything.

424
00:15:50,957 --> 00:15:52,693
Like do I want to attract men?

425
00:15:52,693 --> 00:15:54,165
Yes, of course I do.

426
00:15:54,165 --> 00:15:56,068
Do I want to attract women?

427
00:15:56,068 --> 00:15:58,394
I guess, I don't really think about it.

428
00:15:58,394 --> 00:15:59,858
Isn't it safer to just

429
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:01,043
(ominous music) secretly fall in love

430
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,643
with them while quietly dying inside?

431
00:16:03,643 --> 00:16:05,148
Whatever, it's fine.

432
00:16:05,148 --> 00:16:07,267
I want to attract nonbinary people too of course,

433
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:09,750
but right now you guys are kind of getting in the way

434
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:13,014
of my crudely stereotyping people based on gender, so

435
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:14,114
(tense music) how dare you.

436
00:16:14,114 --> 00:16:16,009
The point is, when I think about my appearance,

437
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:17,803
wanting to attract people to have sex with

438
00:16:17,803 --> 00:16:19,911
is not the main thing going through my head.

439
00:16:19,911 --> 00:16:21,224
What is going through my head?

440
00:16:21,224 --> 00:16:25,224
(Detective Pikachu dance music)

441
00:16:27,379 --> 00:16:29,421
I guess I just want to feel beautiful,

442
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:30,744
I want to see myself in the mirror

443
00:16:30,744 --> 00:16:33,053
and think I look snatched, is that a crime?

444
00:16:33,053 --> 00:16:34,613
I don't feel pretty very often.

445
00:16:34,613 --> 00:16:36,345
I'd say it happens about once a month

446
00:16:36,345 --> 00:16:37,883
when I'm having a good skin day,

447
00:16:37,883 --> 00:16:42,018
I do my makeup just right, I glisten with setting spray,

448
00:16:42,018 --> 00:16:45,533
and then it happens, a tingle goes up my spine.

449
00:16:45,533 --> 00:16:48,116
I am Botticelli, I am Van Gogh.

450
00:16:49,729 --> 00:16:51,562
I have created beauty!

451
00:16:52,843 --> 00:16:55,197
(gasps) I'm a girl!

452
00:16:55,197 --> 00:16:57,057
And then it's over, that's it for a month.

453
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,183
Usually when I look in the mirror,

454
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,239
I can't actually tell whether I'm pretty or not.

455
00:17:00,239 --> 00:17:01,855
Like with other people, I can just look at them

456
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:03,875
and instantly make a judgment about it,

457
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:06,429
but with myself, I have to just guess.

458
00:17:06,429 --> 00:17:07,848
It's the same as being a trans person

459
00:17:07,848 --> 00:17:09,782
trying to figure out whether you pass.

460
00:17:09,782 --> 00:17:12,167
(sighs) Would you clock me?

461
00:17:12,167 --> 00:17:13,250
I'd clock me.

462
00:17:14,187 --> 00:17:17,443
I'd f*ck me too, I don't give a sh*t. (laughs)

463
00:17:17,443 --> 00:17:18,609
Get out of my room mom!

464
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:19,927
It doesn't work like that for me.

465
00:17:19,927 --> 00:17:22,049
I have to rely on other people's feedback.

466
00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:24,153
Of course, the problem with other people's feedback

467
00:17:24,153 --> 00:17:26,504
(ominous music) is that people are liars.

468
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:28,789
You look great hon!

469
00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:31,384
Especially when those people are your fans.

470
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:32,355
("God Save the Queen") Boots the house queen,

471
00:17:32,355 --> 00:17:34,132
step on my throat mother, I'll die for you!

472
00:17:34,132 --> 00:17:35,152
(Natalie claps) Oh my god.

473
00:17:35,152 --> 00:17:36,388
Or when they're your haters.

474
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,313
(ominous music) Your disgusting

475
00:17:37,313 --> 00:17:40,912
giant collarbone outs you as a man at a thousand paces.

476
00:17:40,912 --> 00:17:43,397
(sighs) I guess I'll never know whether I'm pretty or not.

477
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:46,325
But I can estimate, like I have figured out

478
00:17:46,325 --> 00:17:48,045
that I'm too pretty for Twitter,

479
00:17:48,045 --> 00:17:51,203
but I'm not sure yet if I'm pretty enough for Instagram.

480
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:52,495
It's hard being a six.

481
00:17:52,495 --> 00:17:54,933
I have been dipping my toes in the Instagram water.

482
00:17:54,933 --> 00:17:57,222
Before my surgery, I got into a pretty good rhythm

483
00:17:57,222 --> 00:17:59,514
of posting my shitty little makeup looks,

484
00:17:59,514 --> 00:18:02,490
and what I find addictive about it is this constant flow

485
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:04,733
of positive comments from other people,

486
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:06,525
even though I know it's mostly flattery.

487
00:18:06,525 --> 00:18:07,608
("God Save the Queen") You invented beauty,

488
00:18:07,608 --> 00:18:09,577
perfect angel, choke me mommy.

489
00:18:09,577 --> 00:18:11,028
Every time I get a comment like that,

490
00:18:11,028 --> 00:18:13,660
I'm perfect aware that it's wild exaggeration

491
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,606
fueled by parasocial delusions,

492
00:18:15,606 --> 00:18:17,247
but I still get a hit of dopamine

493
00:18:17,247 --> 00:18:19,156
in my biologically female brain.

494
00:18:19,156 --> 00:18:21,204
And the intoxicating thing about Instagram

495
00:18:21,204 --> 00:18:24,060
is that the embellishment of the truth is a two-way street,

496
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,263
thanks to the miracle of Facetune.

497
00:18:26,263 --> 00:18:27,488
(ominous music) Yes, we finally get to talk

498
00:18:27,488 --> 00:18:28,742
about the phones.

499
00:18:28,742 --> 00:18:30,815
See, it's a black mirror because it's a window

500
00:18:30,815 --> 00:18:32,844
into the darkness of the human soul.

501
00:18:32,844 --> 00:18:34,912
Get it, should I explain it again?

502
00:18:34,912 --> 00:18:36,691
Phones live in a society.

503
00:18:36,691 --> 00:18:38,446
Facetune is an app that lets you fix

504
00:18:38,446 --> 00:18:40,033
all the problems with your face.

505
00:18:40,033 --> 00:18:43,026
So here's an unedited pre-FFS picture of me.

506
00:18:43,026 --> 00:18:45,520
What I would do in Facetune is smooth out the complexion,

507
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,913
shrink the nose a little, bring the jaw in,

508
00:18:47,913 --> 00:18:50,592
and use the vibrance tool to make the eyeshadow pop.

509
00:18:50,592 --> 00:18:52,459
It's really no more drastic than the kinds

510
00:18:52,459 --> 00:18:54,408
of photo doctoring people have been doing

511
00:18:54,408 --> 00:18:56,004
since the invention of photography.

512
00:18:56,004 --> 00:18:58,450
What's changed is that now everyone is doing it

513
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:00,595
to their own photos every day.

514
00:19:00,595 --> 00:19:02,408
And I've noticed that when I'm in the habit

515
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:04,542
of editing my flaws out of pictures,

516
00:19:04,542 --> 00:19:07,102
when I look at an unedited picture of myself,

517
00:19:07,102 --> 00:19:08,572
or when I look in the mirror,

518
00:19:08,572 --> 00:19:11,032
my eyes go straight to the flaws.

519
00:19:11,032 --> 00:19:13,783
(sighs) Why are my pores so big?

520
00:19:13,783 --> 00:19:17,144
Why aren't medical scientists doing something to stop this?

521
00:19:17,144 --> 00:19:19,593
Is this really a good use of my mental energy?

522
00:19:19,593 --> 00:19:21,143
Here comes that guilt again.

523
00:19:21,143 --> 00:19:23,429
Instead of worrying about my pores, shouldn't I be

524
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:25,937
helping stop the impending climate catastrophe

525
00:19:25,937 --> 00:19:27,430
that's gonna destroy the planet

526
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:29,936
if we don't change the economy in like 12 years?

527
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:31,522
Shit, I guess it's 11 years now.

528
00:19:31,522 --> 00:19:33,125
It's just hard to focus on climate change

529
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:34,986
when there's so much else on my mind.

530
00:19:34,986 --> 00:19:38,986
(Detective Pikachu dance music)

531
00:19:40,941 --> 00:19:42,201
He's just so cute.

532
00:19:42,201 --> 00:19:44,372
I guess I'd just rather think about the aesthetic

533
00:19:44,372 --> 00:19:47,390
than the apocalypse, and that's the darkness.

534
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:49,864
Why is my neck like two decades older

535
00:19:49,864 --> 00:19:51,378
than the rest of my skin?

536
00:19:51,378 --> 00:19:53,474
(sighs) Do I need Botox yet?

537
00:19:53,474 --> 00:19:54,937
Should I get a facelift?

538
00:19:54,937 --> 00:19:56,406
These are the questions that will not doubt

539
00:19:56,406 --> 00:19:58,618
define the next couple decades of my life.

540
00:19:58,618 --> 00:20:00,785
As if it wasn't bad enough to go through

541
00:20:00,785 --> 00:20:02,826
a second adolescence on camera,

542
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:04,736
I also have to deal with aging,

543
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:07,493
and thus the ritual of skincare products.

544
00:20:07,493 --> 00:20:09,077
Here's my daytime routine.

545
00:20:09,077 --> 00:20:12,003
So first I'm gonna mix the Dermalogica exfoliator

546
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:15,192
with the cleansing gel and just massage my face.

547
00:20:15,192 --> 00:20:16,613
None of this is sponsored by the way,

548
00:20:16,613 --> 00:20:18,504
this is just me supporting corporations

549
00:20:18,504 --> 00:20:21,159
out of the kindness of my heart.

550
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:22,670
Now if I'm not running late for something

551
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:26,102
I will do a face mask, but if I'm out of bed,

552
00:20:26,102 --> 00:20:30,740
it's because I'm running late for something, so,

553
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,392
I've never done a face mask.

554
00:20:32,392 --> 00:20:35,374
Now I'm going to use a toner, which is very important.

555
00:20:35,374 --> 00:20:40,207
Now, a lot of people don't know what a toner does, but um.

556
00:20:41,236 --> 00:20:44,854
Look it tones OK, do you want your face to be un-toned?

557
00:20:44,854 --> 00:20:47,094
Next, I'm gonna spray expensive Korean yeast

558
00:20:47,094 --> 00:20:49,557
directly into my eyes.

559
00:20:49,557 --> 00:20:51,183
I use this 'cause it's actually a lot cheaper

560
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:53,738
than the Japanese yeast, so you're really losing money

561
00:20:53,738 --> 00:20:56,061
if you don't buy it, think of the savings.

562
00:20:56,061 --> 00:20:57,959
Now I'm going to mix a pump of hyaluronic acid

563
00:20:57,959 --> 00:21:02,339
with a couple spritzes of organic Bulgarian rosewater.

564
00:21:02,339 --> 00:21:05,221
You can almost smell the Bulgarian rose fields.

565
00:21:05,221 --> 00:21:06,824
It's enchanting, it's like I'm there.

566
00:21:06,824 --> 00:21:09,341
There's not enough serum in the world for this neck leather.

567
00:21:09,341 --> 00:21:11,921
I use this moisturizer because Gigi Gorgeous told me to,

568
00:21:11,921 --> 00:21:14,346
and I do everything Gigi says.

569
00:21:14,346 --> 00:21:15,959
(tense music) Every f*cking thing.

570
00:21:15,959 --> 00:21:17,665
I know it seems like a lot of products,

571
00:21:17,665 --> 00:21:21,270
but once you get locked into a serious skincare collection,

572
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:23,424
the tendency is to push it as far as you can.

573
00:21:23,424 --> 00:21:25,161
And I feel like I'm forgetting something.

574
00:21:25,161 --> 00:21:26,449
Oh, sunscreen.

575
00:21:26,449 --> 00:21:28,577
I'm not really sure what this does.

576
00:21:28,577 --> 00:21:29,575
We can probably skip it.

577
00:21:29,575 --> 00:21:31,164
And I'm just gonna finish it all off

578
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:34,131
with some more expensive mist.

579
00:21:34,131 --> 00:21:36,605
Yes god, I love a good facial.

580
00:21:36,605 --> 00:21:39,084
I'm so f*cking wet right now.

581
00:21:39,084 --> 00:21:41,091
So after all these products, does my skin

582
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:43,924
look clearer, younger, more toned?

583
00:21:43,924 --> 00:21:48,739
Well, it's hard to say for sure, but it certainly is moist.

584
00:21:48,739 --> 00:21:51,180
This is the part where I usually just stare at my own face

585
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,287
for 10 minutes and contemplate the futility

586
00:21:53,287 --> 00:21:56,001
of my struggle against the ravages of time.

587
00:21:56,001 --> 00:21:58,668
(magical music)

588
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:08,790
(crying) I'm fine, it's fine, this is fine, it's fine.

589
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:16,720

- (sighs) So, isn't beauty supposed to be fun?

594
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:40,982
I'm not having fun right now, why am I not having fun?

595
00:22:40,982 --> 00:22:43,324
I guess I just don't feel beautiful.

596
00:22:43,324 --> 00:22:45,262
And I know a lot of people think I'm pretty,

597
00:22:45,262 --> 00:22:47,619
and I know a lot of other people have it worse than me,

598
00:22:47,619 --> 00:22:49,195
and I know I should be grateful,

599
00:22:49,195 --> 00:22:52,209
and I know I'm privileged to be able to get plastic surgery,

600
00:22:52,209 --> 00:22:53,746
and I know I shouldn't care so much

601
00:22:53,746 --> 00:22:55,409
about this in the first place.

602
00:22:55,409 --> 00:22:58,950
But the truth is that this just eats away at me,

603
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:02,378
and I'm losing a lot of time and life to this pain.

604
00:23:02,378 --> 00:23:04,817
I've been kinda depressed this past month,

605
00:23:04,817 --> 00:23:07,947
and I think part of it is that on a subconscious level

606
00:23:07,947 --> 00:23:09,974
I think I was hoping that surgery

607
00:23:09,974 --> 00:23:11,924
would completely change my self-image

608
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:15,201
and make me like myself, but it really hasn't.

609
00:23:15,201 --> 00:23:16,821
I mean I'm happy with the results,

610
00:23:16,821 --> 00:23:21,202
I'd do it all again, but I still feel the way I felt before.

611
00:23:21,202 --> 00:23:22,824
You have to keep in mind that surgery

612
00:23:22,824 --> 00:23:26,869
fixes very specific problems, like the Adam's apple problem

613
00:23:26,869 --> 00:23:29,601
or the way my forehead looks in profile problem.

614
00:23:29,601 --> 00:23:33,843
But it's really not a solution to deep psychological issues.

615
00:23:33,843 --> 00:23:37,642
I still don't feel beautiful, and I need to face the fact

616
00:23:37,642 --> 00:23:39,374
that I'm never going to feel beautiful

617
00:23:39,374 --> 00:23:41,246
unless I change the way I think.

618
00:23:41,246 --> 00:23:43,474
Because I'm trapped in a doom spiral over here.

619
00:23:43,474 --> 00:23:46,253
And if I'm ever gonna get out, I think I need to start

620
00:23:46,253 --> 00:23:49,614
by forgiving myself for wanting to be beautiful.

621
00:23:49,614 --> 00:23:51,741
There's lots of reasons to want to be beautiful

622
00:23:51,741 --> 00:23:54,095
besides being shallow and vain.

623
00:23:54,095 --> 00:23:56,861
For one, beauty is associated with youth,

624
00:23:56,861 --> 00:24:00,049
it's a symbol of life, of defiance of death.

625
00:24:00,049 --> 00:24:02,350
That's a profound thing to be concerned about.

626
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:05,200
See I'm not a bimbo, I'm a poet.

627
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,566
Beauty is also associated with moral worth.

628
00:24:07,566 --> 00:24:10,121
The beautiful princess versus the evil hag.

629
00:24:10,121 --> 00:24:11,374
There's studies showing that

630
00:24:11,374 --> 00:24:13,229
conventionally attractive people are more likely

631
00:24:13,229 --> 00:24:16,140
to be assumed to be happy, healthy, and trustworthy.

632
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,541
They're more likely to be hired.

633
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:19,504
So it's not just about Instagram likes,

634
00:24:19,504 --> 00:24:20,858
this is serious stuff.

635
00:24:20,858 --> 00:24:23,518
And we the woke, we're all aware of this.

636
00:24:23,518 --> 00:24:26,932
We know that beauty is power, that beauty is political.

637
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:29,421
We know that beauty standards come from the people

638
00:24:29,421 --> 00:24:31,478
with privilege in an unequal society.

639
00:24:31,478 --> 00:24:33,765
We know it's unjust that being light skinned,

640
00:24:33,765 --> 00:24:37,059
cis, able-bodied, or thin is considered more attractive

641
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:40,132
than being dark skinned, trans, disabled, or fat.

642
00:24:40,132 --> 00:24:42,036
We know that female beauty matters so much

643
00:24:42,036 --> 00:24:43,229
because patriarchy.

644
00:24:43,229 --> 00:24:44,812
We know that our obsession with beauty

645
00:24:44,812 --> 00:24:48,068
is being provoked by advertising, the cosmetic industry,

646
00:24:48,068 --> 00:24:51,034
and beauty influencers who are trying to sell us products.

647
00:24:51,034 --> 00:24:53,504
We know, we know, we know all this because we've all

648
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:56,325
been sitting around critiquing it for decades.

649
00:24:56,325 --> 00:25:00,139
Because that's what leftists do, we critique things.

650
00:25:00,139 --> 00:25:03,809
We are finely tuned detectors of racism, sexism, ableism,

651
00:25:03,809 --> 00:25:07,140
fatphobia, transphobia, and capitalism run amak.

652
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,950
We notice an injustice, we problematize it,

653
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:12,875
we critique it, and then we cancel it.

654
00:25:12,875 --> 00:25:15,701
But what's next, when we're done critiquing things,

655
00:25:15,701 --> 00:25:17,505
what are we supposed to do?

656
00:25:17,505 --> 00:25:20,030
Because I'm aware that conventional beauty standards

657
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:21,753
are a racist, sexist, ableist,

658
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:24,014
fatphobic, transphobic social construct

659
00:25:24,014 --> 00:25:26,850
designed to preserve power relations and sell products,

660
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:29,667
but does that awareness mean I desire any less

661
00:25:29,667 --> 00:25:31,342
to be conventionally beautiful?

662
00:25:31,342 --> 00:25:34,415
Well, no, I want it more than ever.

663
00:25:34,415 --> 00:25:36,714
The problem is that the intellectual exercise

664
00:25:36,714 --> 00:25:39,013
of critiquing things doesn't usually

665
00:25:39,013 --> 00:25:41,583
affect my desires very much.

666
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:43,705
So what am I supposed to do, sit here

667
00:25:43,705 --> 00:25:45,913
in silent contemplation until my desires

668
00:25:45,913 --> 00:25:47,669
finally align themselves with the interests

669
00:25:47,669 --> 00:25:50,327
of the international proletarian revolution?

670
00:25:50,327 --> 00:25:53,536
Oh f*ck the revolution, I want to be a pretty rich girl.

671
00:25:53,536 --> 00:25:55,190
I don't wanna be ContraPoints anymore,

672
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,737
I wanna be Gigi Gorgeous.

673
00:25:56,737 --> 00:25:58,826
Fighting fascists on YouTube was an idea

674
00:25:58,826 --> 00:26:01,528
I came up with when I was a male alcoholic.

675
00:26:01,528 --> 00:26:04,119
Unfortunately, America needs a ContraPoints right now

676
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:07,346
more than it needs a 30 year old Gigi Gorgeous impersonator,

677
00:26:07,346 --> 00:26:09,156
so I guess I'm stuck with it.

678
00:26:09,156 --> 00:26:10,666
Maybe it's for the best.

679
00:26:10,666 --> 00:26:13,165
Critiquing society may not change our desires,

680
00:26:13,165 --> 00:26:15,708
but it can motivate us to change society,

681
00:26:15,708 --> 00:26:18,585
and changing society can change our desires.

682
00:26:18,585 --> 00:26:21,493
So how do we change society?

683
00:26:21,493 --> 00:26:22,646
- Revolution.

684
00:26:22,646 --> 00:26:24,210
- Well sure, revolution.

685
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:26,000
Depending on what happens in 2020,

686
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,098
I'll think of grabbing a brick myself.

687
00:26:28,098 --> 00:26:30,808
But failing that, I think there are ways we can work

688
00:26:30,808 --> 00:26:33,400
to loosen the grip of restrictive beauty standards

689
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,597
without the futility of trying to stop caring how we look.

690
00:26:36,597 --> 00:26:38,536
I do think representation matters,

691
00:26:38,536 --> 00:26:40,498
and I think having visible beauty icons

692
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:43,482
who are dark-skinned, or trans, or gender non-conforming,

693
00:26:43,482 --> 00:26:46,032
or disabled, or fat, or over 35,

694
00:26:46,032 --> 00:26:48,537
or influencers makes a big difference.

695
00:26:48,537 --> 00:26:50,472
Beauty standards are social constructs,

696
00:26:50,472 --> 00:26:52,596
and social constructs can change.

697
00:26:52,596 --> 00:26:55,426
That's why it's so important to recognize that influencers

698
00:26:55,426 --> 00:26:56,730
(clapping) are just as valid

699
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:58,168
as other celebrities.

700
00:26:58,168 --> 00:26:59,794
But the problem with changing society

701
00:26:59,794 --> 00:27:03,263
is that it takes a long time, and this video is almost over.

702
00:27:03,263 --> 00:27:06,449
Where I can see an escape from my particular doom spiral

703
00:27:06,449 --> 00:27:10,022
is in style as an alternative ideal to beauty.

704
00:27:10,022 --> 00:27:11,976
You can be stylish at any age.

705
00:27:11,976 --> 00:27:14,294
You can be stylish whether you pass or not.

706
00:27:14,294 --> 00:27:17,307
Style is a way of cultivating a personal aesthetic

707
00:27:17,307 --> 00:27:19,224
that you have complete control over.

708
00:27:19,224 --> 00:27:22,652
It's like art in that originality is a virtue.

709
00:27:22,652 --> 00:27:24,908
Style is an individual aesthetic,

710
00:27:24,908 --> 00:27:28,192
unlike the collective aesthetic of beauty standards.

711
00:27:28,192 --> 00:27:31,274
As the poet Wordsworth said about artistic appreciation,

712
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:33,315
"Every author, as far as he is great

713
00:27:33,315 --> 00:27:35,149
"and at the same time original,

714
00:27:35,149 --> 00:27:37,857
"has had the task of creating the taste

715
00:27:37,857 --> 00:27:39,862
"by which he is to be enjoyed."

716
00:27:39,862 --> 00:27:40,943
So even if you don't conform

717
00:27:40,943 --> 00:27:42,645
to conventional beauty standards,

718
00:27:42,645 --> 00:27:44,914
through the power of original style,

719
00:27:44,914 --> 00:27:47,146
you can create the taste by which

720
00:27:47,146 --> 00:27:49,540
your unique beauty is to be appreciated.

721
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:52,404
Society may frown upon us six foot tr*nnies,

722
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:55,724
but if I know I'm dressed well or my makeup is snatched,

723
00:27:55,724 --> 00:27:59,012
I can easily abide any comment, any stare.

724
00:27:59,012 --> 00:28:01,357
I can be misgendered at Dairy Queen

725
00:28:01,357 --> 00:28:03,944
for all I care, it does not matter.

726
00:28:03,944 --> 00:28:06,947
I can strut with confidence because I am basking

727
00:28:06,947 --> 00:28:11,013
in the regal knowledge of my own aesthetic superiority.

728
00:28:11,013 --> 00:28:13,574
"Bow before me peasants," I proclaim

729
00:28:13,574 --> 00:28:18,474
to the drive thru window, "for I am serving a lerk."

730
00:28:18,474 --> 00:28:21,190
"Sir, this is a Dairy Queen."

731
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:23,625
So I guess that's the solution.

732
00:28:23,625 --> 00:28:26,951
I can't believe I single-handedly ended capitalism.

733
00:28:26,951 --> 00:28:28,041
Now does that mean I'm not gonna get

734
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:30,155
a lot of expensive plastic surgery?

735
00:28:30,155 --> 00:28:31,245
(bouncy piano music) F*ck no!

736
00:28:31,245 --> 00:28:32,457
What do you people think I am,

737
00:28:32,457 --> 00:28:34,851
some kind of transgender Mother Theresa?

738
00:28:34,851 --> 00:28:38,631
Goddamn, the audacity of you people, the hubris.

739
00:28:38,631 --> 00:28:41,384
Look, I need plastic surgery because I have no style.

740
00:28:41,384 --> 00:28:43,225
In fact after the month I've had,

741
00:28:43,225 --> 00:28:45,424
you should be grateful I'm wearing clothes at all.

742
00:28:45,424 --> 00:28:47,837
So, that's it for me, I guess I have nothing

743
00:28:47,837 --> 00:28:50,703
but the decay of time and age to look forward to.

744
00:28:50,703 --> 00:28:52,852
(sighs) I guess I'll just have to find my self-worth

745
00:28:52,852 --> 00:28:56,557
in cultivating kindness, intelligence, and inner beauty.

746
00:28:56,557 --> 00:28:57,390
Ew, gross.

747
00:28:59,283 --> 00:29:03,116
("Gymnopedie 1" by Zoe Blade)

748
00:30:46,725 --> 00:30:48,691
I'm drooling all over myself because my jaw

749
00:30:48,691 --> 00:30:50,931
is still numb from the surgery.

750
00:30:50,931 --> 00:30:51,764
Love that!
