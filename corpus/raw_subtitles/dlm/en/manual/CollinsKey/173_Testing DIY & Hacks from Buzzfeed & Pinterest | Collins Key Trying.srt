00:00:00,106 --> 00:00:01,258
- What's up, it's Collins Key

2
00:00:01,258 --> 00:00:03,082
and welcome to the Thursday vlog.

3
00:00:03,082 --> 00:00:04,938
For today's video, I've taken a whole bunch of DIYs

4
00:00:04,938 --> 00:00:07,415
and hacks from Pinterest and BuzzFeed and today,

5
00:00:07,415 --> 00:00:09,120
we're going to be putting them to the test together

6
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,076
to see if they actually do what they're supposed to do,

7
00:00:11,076 --> 00:00:12,606
or if they even work.

8
00:00:12,606 --> 00:00:13,439
Honestly,

9
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:15,549
I'm expecting quite a few of these to fail pretty miserably.

10
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:17,174
If you want me to do even more DIY videos

11
00:00:17,174 --> 00:00:19,603
like this in the future, let me know by liking this video.

12
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:20,863
If this video gets enough thumbs up,

13
00:00:20,863 --> 00:00:23,034
then I will do even more videos just like this.

14
00:00:23,034 --> 00:00:23,982
Also, I want to let you guys know

15
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:25,246
I'm doing a giveaway this month.

16
00:00:25,246 --> 00:00:26,522
I'm giving away a MacBook.

17
00:00:26,522 --> 00:00:29,088
So if you wanna win that, let me know by liking this video.

18
00:00:29,088 --> 00:00:30,987
Comment down below what's your favorite video

19
00:00:30,987 --> 00:00:32,239
that I've ever posted on this channel

20
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:34,085
and of course, you must be subscribed to my channel.

21
00:00:34,085 --> 00:00:36,249
But right now, without any further ado, let's jump in.

22
00:00:36,249 --> 00:00:37,694
Let's try these DIYs and hacks.

23
00:00:37,694 --> 00:00:38,959
For this first one, we are going to be trying

24
00:00:38,959 --> 00:00:40,795
to create a DIY Lava Lamp.

25
00:00:40,795 --> 00:00:42,206
I really don't know how we're gonna do this

26
00:00:42,206 --> 00:00:44,073
because I don't have any actual lava,

27
00:00:44,073 --> 00:00:47,318
and this thing did not include lava, so...

28
00:00:47,318 --> 00:00:48,664
Yeah, we're just gonna use what we have.

29
00:00:48,664 --> 00:00:50,699
So basically we've got a glass jar here

30
00:00:50,699 --> 00:00:52,548
that kinda resembles a lava lamp.

31
00:00:52,548 --> 00:00:54,879
We have oil, we have salt,

32
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,400
and last but not least, if you wanna be extra special,

33
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,996
you can also use some food coloring.

34
00:00:57,996 --> 00:00:59,329
You guys know me on this channel

35
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:00,342
with these kind of ingredients.

36
00:01:00,342 --> 00:01:01,175
Yeah, we don't need that.

37
00:01:01,175 --> 00:01:02,110
So all you're gonna need for this

38
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,755
is just these basic ingredients.

39
00:01:03,755 --> 00:01:04,920
I actually need that.

40
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,621
For step number one, all you need to do...(chuckles)

41
00:01:07,621 --> 00:01:08,454
Food coloring's back!

42
00:01:08,454 --> 00:01:11,075
Is just take the jar and fill it up

43
00:01:11,075 --> 00:01:12,255
with a whole bunch of water

44
00:01:12,255 --> 00:01:14,562
and I guess I will be using food coloring for this.

45
00:01:14,562 --> 00:01:15,395
Ow!

46
00:01:15,395 --> 00:01:16,411
(gloves snapping and clapping)

47
00:01:16,411 --> 00:01:17,244
Le's do it!

48
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:19,207
These are, by far, the most attractive looking gloves

49
00:01:19,207 --> 00:01:20,040
you can ever wear.

50
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:20,936
Put a couple drops in there.

51
00:01:20,936 --> 00:01:22,368
Next, we'll go with red.

52
00:01:22,368 --> 00:01:24,231
Looks like blood, this is actually kinda creepy.

53
00:01:24,231 --> 00:01:25,303
We got some blue next.

54
00:01:25,303 --> 00:01:26,486
I think I might actually be puttin' too much

55
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:28,183
of the dye in there, but hey we're goin' for it.

56
00:01:28,183 --> 00:01:29,210
Well I think I messed up already

57
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:31,388
because I think I put way too much dye in there. (chuckling)

58
00:01:31,388 --> 00:01:32,425
Now it's just all black.

59
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:33,518
Hey, you live and you learn.

60
00:01:33,518 --> 00:01:34,763
I'm going to be leaving the gloves on

61
00:01:34,763 --> 00:01:37,123
for the remainder of this DIY because I cannot actually

62
00:01:37,123 --> 00:01:38,179
remove them from my hands.

63
00:01:38,179 --> 00:01:39,796
(gloves snap) Ow!

64
00:01:39,796 --> 00:01:40,940
Next you wanna take the oil.

65
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,040
Trying to open this with gloves on.

66
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,431
Aw, man.

67
00:01:43,431 --> 00:01:44,264
Nah.

68
00:01:44,264 --> 00:01:45,716
Once you perfectly open the top of it just like this,

69
00:01:45,716 --> 00:01:47,759
you're going to add the oil to the bottle.

70
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,943
(liquid trickling)

71
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:50,776
Hmm.

72
00:01:50,776 --> 00:01:51,617
Now that you have the oil

73
00:01:51,617 --> 00:01:53,385
and just the black mass of liquid in here,

74
00:01:53,385 --> 00:01:55,427
you're gonna be taking the salt and apparently the salt

75
00:01:55,427 --> 00:01:58,984
is what really makes this DIY come to life.

76
00:01:58,984 --> 00:02:01,299
Cannot get anything off with these gloves on.

77
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:03,090
This is like nearly impossible.

78
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:03,923
There we go.

79
00:02:03,923 --> 00:02:05,833
So apparently the salt will actually drag the oil

80
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:08,486
to the bottom of this, and then shoot it back up to the top.

81
00:02:08,486 --> 00:02:10,263
I don't know how it really works, apparently science.

82
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:11,096
Huh.

83
00:02:11,096 --> 00:02:12,622
Let's see if I can kick start the whole thing.

84
00:02:12,622 --> 00:02:14,008
(liquid shaking)

85
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:15,966
No, it's basically just oil and water

86
00:02:15,966 --> 00:02:17,628
with just a layer of salt on the bottom.

87
00:02:17,628 --> 00:02:19,387
For this, I'm going to be making a phone case

88
00:02:19,387 --> 00:02:20,420
out of a balloon.

89
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,253
(balloon farting)

90
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:28,435
First, you need to inflate the balloon.

91
00:02:28,435 --> 00:02:29,660
Get the balloon.

92
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,883
Ow.

93
00:02:30,883 --> 00:02:31,716
I just whipped my lip.

94
00:02:31,716 --> 00:02:33,319
Next, you're gonna just take the phone like this

95
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,824
and put it on top and then deflate the balloon.

96
00:02:35,824 --> 00:02:37,270
Release it on three, two--

97
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,253
or just now, okay.

98
00:02:38,253 --> 00:02:39,850
(balloon farts)

99
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:40,683
Whoa!

100
00:02:40,683 --> 00:02:41,617
What just happened?!

101
00:02:41,617 --> 00:02:43,633
(cackling)

102
00:02:43,633 --> 00:02:46,133
Can't really like do too much!

103
00:02:47,721 --> 00:02:50,671
Like this weak little thing flappin' off but I mean hey,

104
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:54,599
if you're into funky different phone cases, this is for you.

105
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:57,366
So yeah I guess this life hack, we'll give it a win.

106
00:02:57,366 --> 00:02:58,474
We'll give it a tentative win.

107
00:02:58,474 --> 00:02:59,515
I'm super excited for this one,

108
00:02:59,515 --> 00:03:01,903
because I'm going to be trying to create rainbow bagels.

109
00:03:01,903 --> 00:03:02,918
The only part I'm not excited about

110
00:03:02,918 --> 00:03:04,412
is the fact that I have to wear

111
00:03:04,412 --> 00:03:05,272
these gloves again.

112
00:03:05,272 --> 00:03:06,609
Glove number one.

113
00:03:06,609 --> 00:03:07,819
Glove number two.

114
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:08,702
Ready to go.

115
00:03:08,702 --> 00:03:11,420
So first is my personal favorite, this stuff.

116
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,286
(label tearing)

117
00:03:12,286 --> 00:03:13,119
There we go.

118
00:03:13,119 --> 00:03:14,155
That one's not goin' this time.

119
00:03:14,155 --> 00:03:15,822
(popping) Oh jeez, it got me again!

120
00:03:15,822 --> 00:03:16,695
Next you're gonna be coloring

121
00:03:16,695 --> 00:03:19,278
each one of these individually.

122
00:03:25,043 --> 00:03:27,159
- [French Voice] One eternity later.

123
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:29,037
(dinging)

124
00:03:29,037 --> 00:03:30,919
- I just mixed up all the dough and now the next step

125
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:31,905
is you're gonna take them all out,

126
00:03:31,905 --> 00:03:33,701
place them down flat like a pancake,

127
00:03:33,701 --> 00:03:35,338
and then stack them one on top of the other.

128
00:03:35,338 --> 00:03:37,005
Alright, we'll start with the green one here.

129
00:03:37,005 --> 00:03:38,127
Next is the orange.

130
00:03:38,127 --> 00:03:39,338
After that, we'll do the purple.

131
00:03:39,338 --> 00:03:40,950
Last but not least, a touch of pink.

132
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:43,206
Cut the dough and then you're just gonna kinda roll it

133
00:03:43,206 --> 00:03:44,514
and kind of twist it like this.

134
00:03:44,514 --> 00:03:46,724
You're gonna form it into a bagel.

135
00:03:46,724 --> 00:03:48,282
This is the most lopsided whack-lookin' bagel.

136
00:03:48,282 --> 00:03:49,115
Kinda failed.

137
00:03:49,115 --> 00:03:50,120
Next you're gonna put these in the oven

138
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,796
and just find out what happens.

139
00:03:51,796 --> 00:03:53,729
- [French Voice] A few moments later.

140
00:03:53,729 --> 00:03:55,057
- You know, these actually turned out way better

141
00:03:55,057 --> 00:03:55,890
than I expected.

142
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,273
Oh, we lost a bit of the bagel!

143
00:03:57,273 --> 00:03:58,585
This actually looks pretty awesome,

144
00:03:58,585 --> 00:03:59,832
like with all the stuff on the inside.

145
00:03:59,832 --> 00:04:01,162
Yeah, I guess that one, it's a win.

146
00:04:01,162 --> 00:04:02,907
This one, using nothing more than vitamins

147
00:04:02,907 --> 00:04:04,801
and a little bit of water, we're gonna try to create

148
00:04:04,801 --> 00:04:06,264
glow-in-the-dark liquid.

149
00:04:06,264 --> 00:04:07,539
I have no idea if this is gonna work

150
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:08,646
and I don't even know what you would do

151
00:04:08,646 --> 00:04:10,145
with glow-in-the-dark liquid anyways,

152
00:04:10,145 --> 00:04:11,509
but ey we're gonna try to make it.

153
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:13,846
You're gonna wanna take, I would say, three of the tablets.

154
00:04:13,846 --> 00:04:15,134
It should be perfect.

155
00:04:15,134 --> 00:04:17,434
I saw online, they suggest that you crush it

156
00:04:17,434 --> 00:04:18,661
with a spoon inside a bowl.

157
00:04:18,661 --> 00:04:20,161
Personally, I don't think that's gonna be enough.

158
00:04:20,161 --> 00:04:21,334
So I have another idea.

159
00:04:21,334 --> 00:04:22,549
Alright, here we go.

160
00:04:22,549 --> 00:04:23,399
Gonna use this.

161
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:24,856
Take the three tablets.

162
00:04:24,856 --> 00:04:25,890
Dump them out here,

163
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,489
and I need one more thing.

164
00:04:28,489 --> 00:04:29,438
A sledgehammer.

165
00:04:29,438 --> 00:04:30,622
Alright guys, here we go.

166
00:04:30,622 --> 00:04:31,899
This is how you crush the tablets.

167
00:04:31,899 --> 00:04:33,165
We go three,

168
00:04:33,165 --> 00:04:34,691
two,

169
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:35,524
(beeping and crashing)

170
00:04:35,524 --> 00:04:36,357
Don't think I'm crazy?

171
00:04:36,357 --> 00:04:37,910
No, I'm not gonna use a real sledgehammer.

172
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,175
We are gonna be using the baby sledgehammer.

173
00:04:40,175 --> 00:04:41,008
(ding)

174
00:04:41,008 --> 00:04:41,941
There we go.

175
00:04:41,941 --> 00:04:43,978
So Collins, what'd you do today?

176
00:04:43,978 --> 00:04:44,811
This.

177
00:04:44,811 --> 00:04:46,962
Next, we're just gonna take the finely crushed B12 vitamin

178
00:04:46,962 --> 00:04:48,932
and put it inside the bowl and add water.

179
00:04:48,932 --> 00:04:50,786
(spoon scraping)

180
00:04:50,786 --> 00:04:51,703
Gonna mix it up.

181
00:04:51,703 --> 00:04:52,695
Oh God, this is boring.

182
00:04:52,695 --> 00:04:54,456
Now it's time to find out whether or not this stuff

183
00:04:54,456 --> 00:04:55,705
will really glow in the dark.

184
00:04:55,705 --> 00:04:57,267
Now I can't tell if it's actually glowing

185
00:04:57,267 --> 00:04:59,256
or if it's just the black light making it appear

186
00:04:59,256 --> 00:05:00,973
as though it's glowing, but I'm feeling nice.

187
00:05:00,973 --> 00:05:02,506
So I'm gonna give this one the benefit of the doubt.

188
00:05:02,506 --> 00:05:03,689
This one gets a win.

189
00:05:03,689 --> 00:05:05,837
The final one, we are going full spy mode.

190
00:05:05,837 --> 00:05:07,704
I'm gonna be showing you guys how to turn your phone

191
00:05:07,704 --> 00:05:09,401
into a blacklight.

192
00:05:09,401 --> 00:05:10,245
Hopefully.

193
00:05:10,245 --> 00:05:13,059
Literally, all you need to do is just tape...

194
00:05:13,059 --> 00:05:14,816
But that catch though!

195
00:05:14,816 --> 00:05:16,364
And sharp, the catch again!

196
00:05:16,364 --> 00:05:17,418
And the catch again!

197
00:05:17,418 --> 00:05:18,509
I'm just catching things left and right.

198
00:05:18,509 --> 00:05:19,502
I can throw as many times I,

199
00:05:19,502 --> 00:05:21,084
(gasping) I can literally throw as many times

200
00:05:21,084 --> 00:05:22,042
as I want and catch it!

201
00:05:22,042 --> 00:05:22,930
I got way too excited.

202
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:25,255
All you need is just tape and Sharpie markers.

203
00:05:25,255 --> 00:05:26,396
Let's see if I can get it one more time.

204
00:05:26,396 --> 00:05:27,654
(buzzing)

205
00:05:27,654 --> 00:05:29,526
We can cut that part out, right guys?

206
00:05:29,526 --> 00:05:30,359
This is really easy.

207
00:05:30,359 --> 00:05:32,366
Just take the tape, place it directly over the flash.

208
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:34,192
Then you're just gonna color it in

209
00:05:34,192 --> 00:05:36,166
with a blue Sharpie marker like this.

210
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:37,267
Cover the flash again with tape

211
00:05:37,267 --> 00:05:39,410
and then repeat it again the blue Sharpie marker.

212
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:40,465
This might actually work.

213
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,139
Now for the last one, cover it up again,

214
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:45,930
and using the purple Sharpie, do one more circle over it.

215
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,962
And now it's time to see if we've really

216
00:05:47,962 --> 00:05:49,206
created a blacklight or not.

217
00:05:49,206 --> 00:05:50,902
The only issue is I don't have anything to actually

218
00:05:50,902 --> 00:05:53,023
test the blacklight on, but from what I can tell,

219
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:55,263
this thing does not look like a blacklight at all.

220
00:05:55,263 --> 00:05:56,938
Even when I turned on the blacklight,

221
00:05:56,938 --> 00:05:59,535
it was very different looks for each one of these.

222
00:05:59,535 --> 00:06:00,734
So this one is clearly a fail.

223
00:06:00,734 --> 00:06:02,071
If you want me to do another video

224
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:03,624
where I test life hacks and DIYs,

225
00:06:03,624 --> 00:06:06,383
let me know by liking this video and comment down below.

226
00:06:06,383 --> 00:06:07,991
What's one life hack you've seen

227
00:06:07,991 --> 00:06:09,346
that you really wanna see tested?

228
00:06:09,346 --> 00:06:10,304
I'm posting two videos a week,

229
00:06:10,304 --> 00:06:11,946
