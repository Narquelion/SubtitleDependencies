1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,470
(squeaky squishing)

2
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:02,303
- What?!

3
00:00:02,303 --> 00:00:04,210
You challenged us to try ASMR and we've turned it

4
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:05,850
into a game called "Guess That Sound."

5
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,360
So right now, Devan, there's no way you are gonna

6
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,627
to be able to guess this one, Devan.

7
00:00:09,627 --> 00:00:10,810
- I hear you loud and clear.

8
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,283
- Three, two one.

9
00:00:12,283 --> 00:00:15,030
(crackly squishing)

10
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:16,563
Oh, that sounds so bizarre.

11
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:19,250
- [Devan] Oh, it's Rice Krispies Treats,

12
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,870
but you're crunching them a little bit.

13
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:22,023
- Nope.

14
00:00:22,023 --> 00:00:24,580
(wet squishing noises)

15
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:25,710
- Wait, what?

16
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,320
- Oh my gosh!

17
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,080
- That sounded so cool!

18
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,339
- That was one of the coolest sounds ever.

19
00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:33,975
(popping and crackling)

20
00:00:33,975 --> 00:00:34,808
- Ugh.

21
00:00:34,808 --> 00:00:36,880
My final guess is a squid.

22
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,410
- Nope, it's way sweeter than that, Devan, pull it aside.

23
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:40,790
- Okay. - Honey!

24
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,140
- What? - It was a honeycomb!

25
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:43,681
- Right, now we are on to the next one!

26
00:00:43,681 --> 00:00:44,514
Ugh!

27
00:00:44,514 --> 00:00:46,240
- Alright, that does not sound like an ASMR

28
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,811
calming, relaxing video, bro.

29
00:00:47,811 --> 00:00:48,644
- Ugh!

30
00:00:48,644 --> 00:00:49,754
- This is your first sound, Collins.

31
00:00:49,754 --> 00:00:50,587
- Okay!

32
00:00:50,587 --> 00:00:51,420
- You do.

33
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,636
(tapping noise)

34
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:56,271
(squishing)

35
00:00:56,271 --> 00:00:58,274
- Oh, I don't like it.

36
00:00:58,274 --> 00:01:00,526
(popping)

37
00:01:00,526 --> 00:01:01,359
Ah, what?

38
00:01:02,282 --> 00:01:03,857
(airy squishing)

39
00:01:03,857 --> 00:01:04,690
What?

40
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:05,620
I'm sorry, I mean, (quietly) what?

41
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:07,230
I'm gonna go ground beef.

42
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:08,063
- Interesting.

43
00:01:08,063 --> 00:01:09,240
You can pull back the curtain.

44
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,320
- I'm kinda scared.

45
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,280
- Ta-da! - Ah!

46
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,700
I thought you were gonna throw it at me.

47
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:13,850
- It's slime, bro. - What?

48
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:14,890
Dude, I thought I would've got that, like,

49
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:16,820
right off the bat, dude, slime is so easy.

50
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:17,835
How did I get that wrong?

51
00:01:17,835 --> 00:01:19,272
- I don't know, but you got it wrong,

52
00:01:19,272 --> 00:01:20,470
so now on to the next round.

53
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:21,440
- Oh my gosh.

54
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,470
This is the craziest one yet, Devan.

55
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:24,730
- Okay, are you safe?

56
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:27,272
- Dude, I'm very safe right now, but you might not be.

57
00:01:27,272 --> 00:01:28,280
- [Devan] What?

58
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,113
- I don't know.

59
00:01:29,113 --> 00:01:30,900
This is gonna be probably more of an experience for me

60
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,635
than it will be for you. Alright, here we go.

61
00:01:32,635 --> 00:01:33,963
I just we just, aah.

62
00:01:33,963 --> 00:01:35,360
- I don't hear anything.

63
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,642
I hear you going aah.

64
00:01:36,642 --> 00:01:38,712
- That's 'cause it hasn't begun yet.

65
00:01:38,712 --> 00:01:39,707
Oh boy.

66
00:01:39,707 --> 00:01:40,540
Oh, it smells!

67
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:41,832
Devan, Devan, take a listen.

68
00:01:41,832 --> 00:01:42,665
You ready?

69
00:01:42,665 --> 00:01:43,927
- Smells like salt, like the ocean.

70
00:01:43,927 --> 00:01:44,760
- [Collins] Take a listen.

71
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,025
(slimy squishing and crackling)

72
00:01:47,025 --> 00:01:47,858
(Collins screaming)

73
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:48,962
- Sorry. - Ugh.

74
00:01:48,962 --> 00:01:49,950
- It's a lot to handle.

75
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,806
- That sounds really gross. - Whew!

76
00:01:52,806 --> 00:01:54,690
(squishing)

77
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:56,450
- Is it some sort of vegetable?

78
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,850
- No, but it is a food.

79
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:58,923
It is a food.

80
00:02:01,656 --> 00:02:04,427
- Ugh, dude, that sounds nasty.

81
00:02:04,427 --> 00:02:05,905
- I don't know how much longer I can do this one!

82
00:02:05,905 --> 00:02:06,738
Ready, here we go.

83
00:02:06,738 --> 00:02:07,571
Three, two, one.

84
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,083
Take a guess.

85
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:12,284
- Oh, you're inside of a watermelon

86
00:02:12,284 --> 00:02:14,683
and like punching it, like.

87
00:02:14,683 --> 00:02:15,516
- You think I'm inside a watermelon?

88
00:02:15,516 --> 00:02:16,700
- Yes.

89
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,533
- Do you want to try one more guess?

90
00:02:17,533 --> 00:02:18,366
- Yes.

91
00:02:18,366 --> 00:02:19,199
- Okay, go for it.

92
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:20,032
One more guess, that's it. - Alright.

93
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:22,240
It sounds like a loofah rubbing jell-o.

94
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,073
- Alright, Devan.

95
00:02:23,073 --> 00:02:23,960
Pull back the curtain on the count of three.

96
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,663
Three, two, one.

97
00:02:25,663 --> 00:02:27,040
(both scream)

98
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,447
- Here's your first clue.

99
00:02:28,447 --> 00:02:29,370
(tapping and clunking)

100
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:30,994
- It sounds like you're knocking on wood.

101
00:02:30,994 --> 00:02:32,430
(squishing)

102
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,062
- We're going for it all the way, you ready?

103
00:02:34,062 --> 00:02:35,052
Three, two, one.

104
00:02:35,052 --> 00:02:38,552
(squishing and squeaking)

105
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:41,857
What?

106
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,533
- Dude, it sounds like you're ripping something apart.

107
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,570
- Oh my gosh, I'm like, so uncomfortable.

108
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:52,860
Dude, you better just quit!

109
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,766
Squash, a squash.

110
00:02:54,766 --> 00:02:57,420
- It's not a squash, it's a watermelon.

111
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,180
- Dude. No points for me on this one.

112
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,580
Alright Devan, you ready? - I'm ready.

113
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,579
- Oh man, this is gonna be interesting.

114
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:06,619
(scraping and squeaking)

115
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:08,420
This is the big leagues now, oh man.

116
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,036
Here we go, three, two, one.

117
00:03:11,036 --> 00:03:13,010
But first, five second subscribe challenge.

118
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,870
We want to see if you can subscribe to this channel

119
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,856
and turn on the channel post notifications in five seconds.

120
00:03:17,856 --> 00:03:18,830
Are you ready?

121
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:19,663
Here we go.

122
00:03:19,663 --> 00:03:23,613
- Five, four, three, two, one, done.

123
00:03:23,613 --> 00:03:24,900
- If you can do that,

124
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,925
comment down below Keyper Squad right now.

125
00:03:26,925 --> 00:03:29,258
(crunching)

126
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,010
- Dude, I don't even know.

127
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,680
It could literally be any fruit or vegetable.

128
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,280
So it's definitely crunchy, say a jalapeno?

129
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,750
- You are taking way too long to get this, bro.

130
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,586
We're cutting this off.

131
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:40,530
Here we go, the big reveal, you ready?

132
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,590
Ta-da! - What?

133
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,450
- A cactus!

134
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:44,370
Well, I took off all the spikes on it,

135
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:45,230
so it was safe.

136
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:47,270
And another point Devan does not get,

137
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,260
so right now, we're on to the next one.

138
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,440
- I have to say, I don't think

139
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,960
you're gonna get this at all, bro.

140
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,100
This is gonna be really tough.

141
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,120
Are you ready for this?

142
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,070
- Oh dude, I'm totally ready.

143
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,717
- Three, two, one.

144
00:03:56,717 --> 00:03:59,550
(slimy squishing)

145
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:01,920
- Alright, what are your thoughts?

146
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,753
- Oh, I don't like it.

147
00:04:02,753 --> 00:04:03,586
I don't like it at all.

148
00:04:03,586 --> 00:04:04,960
it makes me feel super uncomfortable.

149
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,554
- Okay, how about this?

150
00:04:06,554 --> 00:04:09,660
(liquid pouring)

151
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,670
- Oh my gosh, bro.

152
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:13,060
Like, I've never felt more uncomfortable from a sound.

153
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,082
What is that? - It sounds so weird.

154
00:04:15,082 --> 00:04:17,690
(slurping) - It's a food of some sort,

155
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,290
because I can hear your mouth is full.

156
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,123
You're eating.

157
00:04:20,123 --> 00:04:20,956
Is it, like, noodles?

158
00:04:20,956 --> 00:04:22,631
- Yeah, you got it, yes!

159
00:04:22,631 --> 00:04:23,464
- Woo!

160
00:04:23,464 --> 00:04:24,297
Oh my gosh.

161
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:26,142
- Yeah, the first sound was this.

162
00:04:26,142 --> 00:04:27,808
(squishing) Oh, it's so gross. - Oh my gosh.

163
00:04:27,808 --> 00:04:29,031
You ready, Devan? - Yeah, I'm so ready.

164
00:04:29,031 --> 00:04:29,870
- Here we go.

165
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,975
(scratchy scraping)

166
00:04:32,975 --> 00:04:34,990
(rustling noise)

167
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,956
- Dude, it sounds like a gerbil playing in the grass.

168
00:04:37,956 --> 00:04:39,055
- (laughs) Alright, well you know what,

169
00:04:39,055 --> 00:04:40,080
actually, I want to take it to the next level right now.

170
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,656
Here we go, got some of this.

171
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:44,150
(scraping)

172
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,254
- It sounds like a broom, like the bottom of a broom.

173
00:04:47,254 --> 00:04:49,096
(water dripping)

174
00:04:49,096 --> 00:04:49,929
It's a rainforest.

175
00:04:49,929 --> 00:04:52,319
- Whoa, oh no, no. - What?

176
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:53,929
- Is this part of the sounds?

177
00:04:53,929 --> 00:04:55,170
- It's not a part of the sound, I promise.

178
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,295
- Hey, what's going on over there?

179
00:04:56,295 --> 00:04:57,128
- Nothing.

180
00:04:57,128 --> 00:04:57,961
- Did you spill something? - No, dude.

181
00:04:57,961 --> 00:04:59,370
- Is it, like, foam or something?

182
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,210
- Yes! Dude, it's foam. - It is, really?

183
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:02,043
Yes!

184
00:05:02,043 --> 00:05:04,080
Oh, dude.

185
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,108
- Watch, you take a block of it

186
00:05:05,108 --> 00:05:06,575
and I'll take a block of it, ready?

187
00:05:06,575 --> 00:05:10,330
- Oh, it's so satisfying. - It feels so cool.

188
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:11,710
Alright well, Devan somehow guessed it,

189
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,550
but right now, guys, we're onto the next one.

190
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,290
(shouting)

191
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,721
- Three, two, one.

192
00:05:16,721 --> 00:05:19,638
(watery squishing)

193
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,200
- What? - Any guesses?

194
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,433
- No guesses.

195
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,140
Oh my gosh!

196
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,722
I feel like this is a zombie movie

197
00:05:31,722 --> 00:05:33,700
and it sounds like brains.

198
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,747
Ugh, it's like (grunting).

199
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,947
That's my guess, keep going.

200
00:05:38,947 --> 00:05:41,930
(squishing)

201
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:42,763
Yeah, I have no clue.

202
00:05:42,763 --> 00:05:44,360
I'm gonna say brains. - Brains?

203
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,615
- Brains is my final answer. - Alright.

204
00:05:45,615 --> 00:05:46,652
Pull back the curtain.

205
00:05:46,652 --> 00:05:47,650
Hey, tomatoes!

206
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:48,890
- For a second I thought it was actually brains,

207
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,570
because it was all red, I was like, what is that?

208
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:51,403
- Nope. - Tomato?

209
00:05:51,403 --> 00:05:52,400
- Tomato, bro.

210
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,010
- Alright, well I did not get a point on that one.

211
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,080
That sounds crazy.

212
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,110
We're onto the next one.

213
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,432
Three, two, one.

214
00:05:57,432 --> 00:05:59,530
(scraping and ripping)

215
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:00,610
Oh my gosh!

216
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,237
I yelled right over the ASMR sounds

217
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:03,810
because I got a little scared.

218
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:04,660
Let me try this again.

219
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:08,362
Prepare yourself for another blast of ASMR soundiness.

220
00:06:08,362 --> 00:06:10,529
(ripping)

221
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,593
- What?

222
00:06:14,593 --> 00:06:17,480
It sounds like beans are falling, but it also sounds like

223
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,410
something's breaking at the same time.

224
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:20,344
- I'm exhausted.

225
00:06:20,344 --> 00:06:23,385
(spaghetti cracking)

226
00:06:23,385 --> 00:06:24,400
(screaming)

227
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,430
- [Devan] It's something cracking!

228
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,430
It's something snapping.

229
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,300
Maybe you're cracking noodles, is that what it is?

230
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,968
- I have a lot of noodles. - Yeah!

231
00:06:29,968 --> 00:06:30,930
- Alright, one more package.

232
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,130
You should try to give it a good old twist

233
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,390
and see how difficult it is.

234
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,266
- Alright, I'm ready.

235
00:06:34,266 --> 00:06:35,322
- Unsheathe the noodles!

236
00:06:35,322 --> 00:06:36,155
(victorious shouting)

237
00:06:36,155 --> 00:06:36,993
- Three, two, one.

238
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,990
- No, see, that's the issue. You just snapped it like that.

239
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:41,870
You're supposed to twist it.

240
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,320
- It sounded awesome.

241
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,150
- You didn't get the full noodle workout, Devan.

242
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,850
Right now, it's onto the next one.

243
00:06:47,962 --> 00:06:49,370
- Alright, Collins, it's time for the next one.

244
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:50,400
You ready? - Let's do it.

245
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,012
- Three, two, one.

246
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:54,612
(popping, air releasing)

247
00:06:54,612 --> 00:06:55,527
(squeaking)

248
00:06:55,527 --> 00:06:57,182
- That sounded like microphone feedback, what?

249
00:06:57,182 --> 00:06:58,341
- Alright, here we go, it continues.

250
00:06:58,341 --> 00:07:00,160
(metal scraping)

251
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,712
This is the final thing.

252
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:04,842
(liquid pouring)

253
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:07,692
Oh dude, this stuff is crazy!

254
00:07:07,692 --> 00:07:10,500
(sloshing and clunking)

255
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,890
This should give you a hint, Collins.

256
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,235
This should give you a hint. - Okay.

257
00:07:13,235 --> 00:07:16,090
(light scraping)

258
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:17,630
What kind of hint is that?

259
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,780
- Alright, you know what I'll do?

260
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,770
I'll let you touch this one.

261
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:21,510
Put your hand down, like underneath.

262
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,880
Here you go. - Okay.

263
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,552
- And then, there it is.

264
00:07:24,552 --> 00:07:25,385
(shouting)

265
00:07:25,385 --> 00:07:26,345
- What is that?

266
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:28,750
- What is it? - It's like a soup.

267
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,140
- No, it's not a soup, bro.

268
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,770
Is that your final guess? - Chicken soup.

269
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,332
- It is a rattlesnake! - What?

270
00:07:33,332 --> 00:07:34,490
- Yeah, dude.

271
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,700
It's actually a rattlesnake. - No way.

272
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,390
- I was, like, rattling the can around.

273
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,040
You can kind of see the rattle in there.

274
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,870
You definitely lost that one, bro.

275
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:42,703
- Alright, Devan, you ready?

276
00:07:42,703 --> 00:07:44,080
- I am so ready. - So here we go.

277
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,175
So I'm actually gonna use a--

278
00:07:45,175 --> 00:07:46,280
(metal tinging)

279
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,200
- What is that?

280
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,033
- Alright, here we go, you ready?

281
00:07:48,033 --> 00:07:50,174
Hold on, I need to move something else.

282
00:07:50,174 --> 00:07:51,724
Alright, here we go.

283
00:07:51,724 --> 00:07:55,474
(metal tinging and scraping)

284
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,010
- It sounds like a saw on wood!

285
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:00,820
- A saw on wood? - Yeah.

286
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01,653
Did I get it? - Nope.

287
00:08:01,653 --> 00:08:03,105
Pull back the curtain, Devan.

288
00:08:03,105 --> 00:08:03,938
- What?

289
00:08:03,938 --> 00:08:05,660
- It's a lemon on a cheese grater.

290
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,280
- It sounds like a saw, bro.

291
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,830
- Alright, right now we're onto the next one.

292
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,960
I'm gonna enjoy some zesty lemons.

293
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,793
- Alright, Collins.

294
00:08:11,793 --> 00:08:14,210
I am fairly confident you are not going to guess this.

295
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:15,335
One hundred percent.

296
00:08:15,335 --> 00:08:16,520
(slurping)

297
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,420
Oh dude, it's my turn.

298
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,467
Three, two, one.

299
00:08:19,467 --> 00:08:21,800
(crackling)

300
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,150
- It's a food wrapper.

301
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,460
- Nope, gotta guess again.

302
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,293
- What?

303
00:08:26,293 --> 00:08:27,810
(honking)

304
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:28,643
What?

305
00:08:28,643 --> 00:08:30,190
A toy duck? - Nope.

306
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,523
(squeaking)

307
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,670
- What on earth, dude?

308
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:36,503
What is this?

309
00:08:36,503 --> 00:08:38,170
Is it a goose or a geese?

310
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:39,110
- Nope, it's not.

311
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,069
It's a gnome!

312
00:08:40,069 --> 00:08:42,340
(laughing)

313
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,930
I knew there was no way you were gonna get it, dude.

314
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:45,837
- Alright well, Devan, I guess you

315
00:08:45,837 --> 00:08:46,670
get the point on that one.

316
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,780
Alright, Devan, so here's the next ingredient.

317
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,894
This thing is going to be super duper, duper, duper weird.

318
00:08:50,894 --> 00:08:51,727
- Okay.

319
00:08:51,727 --> 00:08:53,224
- Oh, I need to adjust my microphone for this thing.

320
00:08:53,224 --> 00:08:55,980
(watery crinkling)

321
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,914
- It's got some plastic bits.

322
00:08:57,914 --> 00:08:58,747
(Collins sneezes)

323
00:08:58,747 --> 00:08:59,580
That was a sneeze.

324
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:08,380
- It's a walrus flying under the water.

325
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,046
I have no clue. - Well you were very close,

326
00:09:10,046 --> 00:09:12,610
because it's actually cottage cheese with a thingy thingy!

327
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:13,520
I don't know what this thing's called,

328
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,810
but it's like a spinny, spinny cookie thing.

329
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:16,850
That's delicious.

330
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,340
- And I clearly didn't-- - You don't get a point, bro.

331
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,240
- I know, I know.

332
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,740
Alright, onto the next round.

333
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,400
Alright, Collins, are you ready for this?

334
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,912
- You've already started it, yes.

335
00:09:23,912 --> 00:09:25,930
(pained groaning) See, what if I say I'm not ready?

336
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,437
- Well then, we just, we wait.

337
00:09:27,437 --> 00:09:28,690
(crickets chirping)

338
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:29,750
- Okay, I'm ready. - Alright, here we go.

339
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:30,820
The first sound.

340
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,153
(crackling and popping)

341
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,063
- It sounds like saran wrapping, like stretched.

342
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,420
I'm so stumped right now.

343
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,770
- Here's your last chance.

344
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:46,120
Are you ready? - Yes.

345
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,190
- Three, two-- - No, I'm not ready.

346
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,023
Okay, now I'm ready.

347
00:09:49,023 --> 00:09:50,388
- Alright, three, two, one.

348
00:09:50,388 --> 00:09:52,638
(cracking)

349
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:54,520
- What?

350
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,230
That last sound came out of nowhere.

351
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:59,820
You eating a carrot covered in saran wrap?

352
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,190
- Oh, wait, that's a good idea.

353
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:02,357
Alright.

354
00:10:02,357 --> 00:10:04,607
(chomping)

355
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,210
- Oh, celery! - What?

356
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,043
No!

357
00:10:08,043 --> 00:10:09,770
Dude, the chew gave it away.

358
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:10,910
Otherwise, I would've not gotten that.

359
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,763
- I should not have done that.

360
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,528
Oh, it sounds so cool!

361
00:10:17,528 --> 00:10:20,195
(loud cracking)

362
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:23,660
- I didn't do it as cool as you did.

363
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,493
- Nope.

364
00:10:24,493 --> 00:10:25,326
- And I, like, broke all of them.

365
00:10:25,326 --> 00:10:26,353
Wow, it smells like celery right now.

366
00:10:26,353 --> 00:10:28,515
Alright, well right now we're onto the next one.

367
00:10:28,515 --> 00:10:30,672
Alright Devan, you ready? - I'm so ready, bro.

368
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:31,505
- Alright, here we go.

369
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:33,056
Give me one second. - Okay, one?

370
00:10:33,056 --> 00:10:36,237
What are you doing over there? - Nothing.

371
00:10:36,237 --> 00:10:37,496
- Ready? - I'm ready.

372
00:10:37,496 --> 00:10:39,878
(rustling and thumping)

373
00:10:39,878 --> 00:10:41,170
- What are you hitting, bro?

374
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,730
It literally sounds like a horse, bro.

375
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:44,563
- Really?

376
00:10:44,563 --> 00:10:46,330
- Yeah, it sounds like a horse going nom, nom.

377
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:48,080
- You might be right. - Is it hay?

378
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,913
It is actually hay?

379
00:10:48,913 --> 00:10:50,213
- Yes, it's hay. - It is.

380
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:53,080
- You're scaring me, bro.

381
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:53,913
Just take the stuff off.

382
00:10:53,913 --> 00:10:54,760
- This is me, bro!

383
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,490
The new and improved Collins.

384
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,910
Alright, well I think you get the point right now.

385
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:01,136
- I can't believe I got this right.

386
00:11:01,136 --> 00:11:02,386
It's so random.

387
00:11:03,294 --> 00:11:04,480
- Now we're onto the next one.

388
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,384
- Alright, Collins.

389
00:11:05,384 --> 00:11:06,217
You got your headphones on?

390
00:11:06,217 --> 00:11:07,230
- Oh dude, I so have my headphones on.

391
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,540
- Oh snap, here we go.

392
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,570
Here's your first sound, you ready for this.

393
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:11,403
Are you ready?

394
00:11:11,403 --> 00:11:12,480
Are you a pitbull or are you Collins right now?

395
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,313
- I'm both.

396
00:11:13,313 --> 00:11:14,679
I'm Collins. (snarling)

397
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:16,122
- Alright, three, two, one.

398
00:11:16,122 --> 00:11:18,990
(rattling)

399
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,610
- It sounds like either marbles

400
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:23,633
or a thousand tiny little ants with club shoes on.

401
00:11:25,706 --> 00:11:26,539
- Club shoes, what are those?

402
00:11:26,539 --> 00:11:27,770
- They're shoes that have like, I don't know.

403
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,570
- Maybe a party's going on? - Yeah.

404
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,230
Oh man, what is that?

405
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,460
It sounds, like, super familiar.

406
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,880
Like from my childhood or something.

407
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,120
You know what, I think I got it.

408
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,199
Oh, what is it?

409
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,418
It's duck tape with sand.

410
00:11:41,418 --> 00:11:42,341
Sandy duck tape!

411
00:11:42,341 --> 00:11:43,187
- You're out of time.

412
00:11:43,187 --> 00:11:45,510
It was this thing dude. - Oh, I knew it!

413
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:48,670
Imprints of your face, be like it's my nose.

414
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,090
- Alright you didn't get a point on this one,

415
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:51,870
so we're on to the next round.

416
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,109
- Take a listen, here we go.

417
00:11:53,109 --> 00:11:55,442
(squishing)

418
00:11:56,373 --> 00:11:58,380
- Dude, it sounds like a comb,

419
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,683
but like a squishing rubber comb.

420
00:11:59,683 --> 00:12:00,760
- Is that your guess?

421
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,060
A squishy rubber comb?

422
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:04,460
- Yeah dude, I don't know what else it could be.

423
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:09,254
Oh, it kind of sounds like soggy mashed potatoes

424
00:12:09,254 --> 00:12:10,300
or something.

425
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,133
- Pull the curtain back.

426
00:12:11,133 --> 00:12:11,966
- Oh, you're not pulling it back?

427
00:12:11,966 --> 00:12:12,799
- No, you pull it back.

428
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:14,040
- Hello. - You covered it.

429
00:12:15,148 --> 00:12:16,870
So I was kind of right, it is made

430
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,378
of some sort of plastic-y, rubber material.

431
00:12:19,378 --> 00:12:20,742
- Alright, Collins, you got your headphones on?

432
00:12:20,742 --> 00:12:21,575
- Uh-huh.

433
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:23,360
- This is the next item, you ready for this?

434
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,079
- Oh, I'm so ready. - Three, two, one.

435
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:27,329
(scraping)

436
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,125
- No way, what is this? - Any guesses yet?

437
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:35,920
- It sounds like you're peeling something almost.

438
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,813
- You're kind of close. - I am?

439
00:12:36,813 --> 00:12:38,763
- I mean, it's not totally wrong, yeah.

440
00:12:41,126 --> 00:12:41,959
- Wait, is that like a cracking?

441
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:42,970
- Yeah, that's a cracking.

442
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,787
This is your last chance, you ready for this?

443
00:12:44,787 --> 00:12:45,620
- Oh, I'm ready.

444
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:48,080
- Three, two, one. - Whoa!

445
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:48,913
Oh dude, I got it, I got it.

446
00:12:48,913 --> 00:12:50,397
- What? - A pencil?

447
00:12:50,397 --> 00:12:51,779
- Oh you got it, dude!

448
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:54,510
- Oh my gosh, I recognized the sound of it.

449
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,550
- You got it.

450
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,383
- Finally, another point.

451
00:12:56,383 --> 00:12:57,730
Alright, right now we're onto the next one.

452
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:58,563
This next one, Devan.

453
00:12:58,563 --> 00:12:59,410
You think you'll be able to get it?

454
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,222
- I'm ready. - Alright, here we go.

455
00:13:01,222 --> 00:13:02,652
- I'm Batman. - I'm not.

456
00:13:02,652 --> 00:13:04,360
(crinkling)

457
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,336
- Oh, is that, like, cat food?

458
00:13:06,336 --> 00:13:07,243
(meowing)

459
00:13:07,243 --> 00:13:08,483
That's a really bad impression, bro.

460
00:13:08,483 --> 00:13:09,430
- That's a horrible cat impression.

461
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,120
Cat ASMR. (squeaking)

462
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,525
- What was that? - It's like what cats do.

463
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:15,530
Like (grunting).

464
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:16,363
Right?

465
00:13:16,363 --> 00:13:18,530
Take a listen to this, Devan.

466
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:20,200
- I don't know, little rubber beads?

467
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,346
- That would be a nope!

468
00:13:22,346 --> 00:13:24,390
Yeah! - What?

469
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:26,310
I can't believe that that sounds like that.

470
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,143
Dude.

471
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,849
It sounds like something's popping.

472
00:13:30,849 --> 00:13:32,012
- For sure.

473
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:33,210
- That doesn't sound like it'd be this thing.

474
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:34,320
- No points for you again.

475
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,650
But right now, we're onto the next one.

476
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:36,767
- I'm not even mad.

477
00:13:36,767 --> 00:13:37,600
(whispering) Hey, Collins.

478
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,604
Are you ready?

479
00:13:38,604 --> 00:13:39,437
- Uh-huh.

480
00:13:39,437 --> 00:13:41,222
- This is the first sound.

481
00:13:41,222 --> 00:13:44,595
(scraping and squeaking)

482
00:13:44,595 --> 00:13:45,993
- Is it, like, a balloon?

483
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:50,740
It's like the top of a can being twisted,

484
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,700
like a plastic can?

485
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,533
- You got it wrong.

486
00:13:52,533 --> 00:13:54,360
- It's a Starbucks cup, bro! - What?

487
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:58,029
- No way, that's crazy.

488
00:13:58,029 --> 00:13:58,880
- I would not have expected that at all.

489
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,160
Oh wait, I wanna hear what it sounds like

490
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,640
when you open it up, you ready for this?

491
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,314
Three, two, one.

492
00:14:03,314 --> 00:14:05,240
- Whoa, dude, what was that?

493
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,340
This is all about the calm.

494
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,264
The relaxing elements of ASMR.

495
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:11,764
(unintelligible shouting)

496
00:14:15,942 --> 00:14:17,287
- Was that a toy megaphone?

497
00:14:17,287 --> 00:14:20,360
Oh it is, I got it right!

498
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,870
- This is how our final challenge works.

499
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,010
We're going to hear an ASMR sound

500
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:24,680
and then we have to use the items in front of us

501
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,990
to figure out which item made that sound.

502
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,614
Whoever gets it first, they win this final round.

503
00:14:28,614 --> 00:14:30,210
So play the new sound.

504
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:31,240
Wait, three second like challenge.

505
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,790
We want to see if you can like this video

506
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,350
in three seconds, are you ready?

507
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:38,222
Here we go, three, two, one, done.

508
00:14:38,222 --> 00:14:41,139
(metallic ringing)

509
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,630
- Wait, what?

510
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,710
- How are we gonna get this?

511
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:45,732
Alright, here we go.

512
00:14:45,732 --> 00:14:47,238
Three, two, one, go.

513
00:14:47,238 --> 00:14:48,631
- It's this thing.

514
00:14:48,631 --> 00:14:50,450
Hello, hello.

515
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:54,117
(accordion and horn noises)

516
00:15:00,203 --> 00:15:02,067
- It's like ASMR overload right now.

517
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:05,984
(horn honking and air blowing)

518
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:07,871
- I think I got it.

519
00:15:07,871 --> 00:15:09,960
(metal ringing)

520
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,810
Are your ears ringing like mine are?

521
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,010
- My ears are okay.

522
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,472
Alright, let's keep going bro.

523
00:15:14,472 --> 00:15:15,843
Holy cow.

524
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,580
- Oh no. - Yes!

525
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:21,226
- What, no, no, no! - This has gotta be it.

526
00:15:21,226 --> 00:15:22,758
- No, maybe it's this thing.

527
00:15:22,758 --> 00:15:23,857
- Here we go, three, two, one.

528
00:15:23,857 --> 00:15:25,210
(metal clinging)

529
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:26,748
- Oh, wait a second.

530
00:15:26,748 --> 00:15:28,320
I think it's mine, bro.

531
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,337
- No, it's gotta be mine.

532
00:15:30,337 --> 00:15:31,529
- Okay, the only way to decide

533
00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:32,362
is we have to go back and listen

534
00:15:32,362 --> 00:15:33,700
to the sounds one more time.

535
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,554
Play it one more time.

536
00:15:34,554 --> 00:15:36,470
(metallic ringing)

537
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,050
- Darn it. - Yes!

538
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,330
It was totally mine!

539
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:40,163
- Really?

540
00:15:40,163 --> 00:15:42,553
- I have won the challenge, yes!

541
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:45,210
Oh, and we've got merch!

542
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,990
And just imagine how cool you're gonna look

543
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:48,320
wearing the Keyper Squad merch.
