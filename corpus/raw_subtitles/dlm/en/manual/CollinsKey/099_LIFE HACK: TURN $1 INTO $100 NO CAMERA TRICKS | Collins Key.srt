00:00:00,182 --> 00:00:01,652
- What's up guys, it's Collins Key and today

2
00:00:01,652 --> 00:00:03,392
I'm teaching you a brand new life hack

3
00:00:03,392 --> 00:00:06,018
here in Beverly Hills with some money.

4
00:00:06,018 --> 00:00:08,761
I'm gonna teach you how to make money instantly

5
00:00:08,761 --> 00:00:10,270
and you can get rich real quick,

6
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:12,152
so all you have to do for this is grab a few bills,

7
00:00:12,152 --> 00:00:14,887
I like to use one, two, three, four, five dollars,

8
00:00:14,887 --> 00:00:16,895
nothing too crazy, but check it out.

9
00:00:16,895 --> 00:00:18,296
If you take this money, and you're gonna need

10
00:00:18,296 --> 00:00:21,515
on more thing as well, you're also going to need a lighter

11
00:00:21,515 --> 00:00:23,332
because what people don't know is that when bills

12
00:00:23,332 --> 00:00:26,449
are printed, they're first printed as hundreds

13
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:29,134
and then over that they're printed as ones, fives, tens,

14
00:00:29,134 --> 00:00:32,435
and so on, so if you heat up the ink like this, watch.

15
00:00:32,435 --> 00:00:34,307
Be careful, it's like that, look,

16
00:00:34,307 --> 00:00:37,400
it actually changed, you guys see this?

17
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,806
Look it, that's now one, two, three, four,

18
00:00:40,806 --> 00:00:43,703
$500 just by activating the ink,

19
00:00:43,703 --> 00:00:46,234
so if this life hack blew your mind

20
00:00:46,234 --> 00:00:48,020
make sure you guys share with your friends right now

21
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,678
and give the video a thumbs up if you want me to do

22
00:00:49,678 --> 00:00:51,753

00:00:51,753 --> 00:00:53,790

24
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,433
should I use in my life hack videos

25
00:00:55,433 --> 00:00:57,328
and this is $500 to celebrate the fact

26
00:00:57,328 --> 00:01:00,648
that I just hit 500,000 subscribers here on YouTube.
