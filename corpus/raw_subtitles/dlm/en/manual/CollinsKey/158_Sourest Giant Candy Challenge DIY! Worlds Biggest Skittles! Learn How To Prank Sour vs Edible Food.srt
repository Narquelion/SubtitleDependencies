00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:20,064
Done!

183
00:04:20,064 --> 00:04:20,897
- Is it done?

184
00:04:20,897 --> 00:04:21,730
- All done.

185
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,138
(both talking excitedly)

186
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:24,304
- [Collins] Only got one shot at this.

187
00:04:24,304 --> 00:04:26,037
Nothing to do with my laser skills,

188
00:04:26,037 --> 00:04:27,529
my laser skills were on point.

189
00:04:27,529 --> 00:04:28,362
- Oh no!

190
00:04:28,362 --> 00:04:30,123
- Tada! Check it out bro,

191
00:04:30,123 --> 00:04:31,581
mine's got all the little sour thingies in it.

192
00:04:31,581 --> 00:04:32,838
Gonna pop these in here.

193
00:04:32,838 --> 00:04:33,671
One two three

194
00:04:33,671 --> 00:04:35,594
- Now it's time for mine, here we go.

195
00:04:35,594 --> 00:04:36,969
Three two one.

196
00:04:36,969 --> 00:04:38,277
Wait, dude it didn't work.

197
00:04:38,277 --> 00:04:39,943
- Oh I know what's missing, here we go. Tiki time!

198
00:04:39,943 --> 00:04:40,776
- What?

199
00:04:40,776 --> 00:04:42,169
- Check this out, three two one.

200
00:04:42,169 --> 00:04:44,455
Bam, and that right there is the power of the tiki.

201
00:04:44,455 --> 00:04:46,369
So now, it's time to add the malic acid.

202
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,762
You gotta be very careful with that one.

203
00:04:47,762 --> 00:04:49,826
- [Devan] That wasn't, dude that's careful?

204
00:04:49,826 --> 00:04:50,659
- [Collins] You know what?

205
00:04:50,659 --> 00:04:53,020
- I will be very careful, trying to shake off some of it.

206
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,908
- [Collins] Party time, it's the summer let's go.

207
00:04:55,908 --> 00:04:57,607
- [Devan] Gotta spread mine around a little bit,

208
00:04:57,607 --> 00:04:59,386
just like that. - And now the moment of truth.

209
00:04:59,386 --> 00:05:00,830
Gotta flip it over, three two one boom.

210
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,956
And ya gotta coat the bottom side

211
00:05:02,956 --> 00:05:03,906
with some malic acid as well.

212
00:05:03,906 --> 00:05:04,870
There you have it.

213
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,687
These are the giant sour patch kids.

214
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,185
Time to see how the sour patch kid taste.

215
00:05:08,185 --> 00:05:10,011
You ready, here we go. Three two one

216
00:05:10,011 --> 00:05:11,302
One of the first five second subscribe challenge

217
00:05:11,302 --> 00:05:12,816
We want to see if you can subscribe to this channel

218
00:05:12,816 --> 00:05:14,633
and turn on the channel post notifications

219
00:05:14,633 --> 00:05:15,666
in five seconds.

220
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:16,532
Are you ready?

221
00:05:16,532 --> 00:05:17,365
Here we go.

222
00:05:17,365 --> 00:05:20,198
Five, four, three, two, one, done.

223
00:05:21,806 --> 00:05:22,987
If you can do that, comment down below

224
00:05:22,987 --> 00:05:24,188
keyper squad right now.

225
00:05:24,188 --> 00:05:25,556
Whoa!

226
00:05:25,556 --> 00:05:26,389
- Oh

227
00:05:26,389 --> 00:05:27,222
- Oh

228
00:05:27,222 --> 00:05:28,055
- Oh

229
00:05:28,055 --> 00:05:29,175
(both spit out jell-O)

230
00:05:29,175 --> 00:05:30,532
Whew, God that is horrible!

231
00:05:30,532 --> 00:05:32,472
Oh my God that is sour.

232
00:05:32,472 --> 00:05:35,981
Alright, right now we're on the next round.

233
00:05:35,981 --> 00:05:36,884
Uh!

234
00:05:36,884 --> 00:05:38,285
- Dude wait what.

235
00:05:38,285 --> 00:05:39,118
- Holy cow.

236
00:05:39,118 --> 00:05:40,679
You challenged us to make a giant twix.

237
00:05:40,679 --> 00:05:41,938
So right now, let's go.

238
00:05:41,938 --> 00:05:43,305
For this one, it's time to make some biscuits.

239
00:05:43,305 --> 00:05:44,380
- What did you do?

240
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,880
- So first step we gotta get some eggs.

241
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,953
But here's the deal, Devan,

242
00:05:46,953 --> 00:05:48,424
we need to only get the yolks out.

243
00:05:48,424 --> 00:05:49,961
I got a special way of opening this thing up.

244
00:05:49,961 --> 00:05:51,589
This is the egg cracker 2000.

245
00:05:51,589 --> 00:05:54,277
(infomercial music)

246
00:05:54,277 --> 00:05:55,110
Come on!

247
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:55,943
- What?

248
00:05:55,943 --> 00:05:56,974
- Kinda like, go back and forth like this.

249
00:05:56,974 --> 00:05:57,807
- [Devan] Come on!

250
00:05:57,807 --> 00:05:59,015
- Why do you have to do that by the.

251
00:05:59,015 --> 00:05:59,848
- Oh.

252
00:05:59,848 --> 00:06:00,681
Three two one.

253
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:01,514
Oh!

254
00:06:01,514 --> 00:06:02,347
- It worked!

255
00:06:02,347 --> 00:06:03,180
Alright here we go.

256
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,013
Whoa!

257
00:06:04,013 --> 00:06:07,301
(suspenseful music)

258
00:06:07,301 --> 00:06:08,134
- [Devan] Oh, bro.

259
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:08,967
- Nailed it!

260
00:06:08,967 --> 00:06:09,800
- Bro that was terrifying.

261
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,473
- Well, you know the egg cracer 8000 did it's job.

262
00:06:11,473 --> 00:06:14,338
- Wait, bro, aren't we only supposed to get egg yolks.

263
00:06:14,338 --> 00:06:16,004
- Oh, yeah maybe the egg cracker 10000

264
00:06:16,004 --> 00:06:17,511
wasn't quite the best way to go.

265
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:19,602
That's what we got these little tube things for.

266
00:06:19,602 --> 00:06:20,457
Sucking out the yolks.

267
00:06:20,457 --> 00:06:22,405
This is, uh, not as effective as I thought it would be.

268
00:06:22,405 --> 00:06:24,057
- [Devan] Boom, first egg yolk done.

269
00:06:24,057 --> 00:06:25,526
- Now we need to add a half cup of suger.

270
00:06:25,526 --> 00:06:26,764
To do this, I need to activate my

271
00:06:26,764 --> 00:06:28,480
ambiguous chihuahua cat dog.

272
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,566
- The what?

273
00:06:29,566 --> 00:06:30,399
- Check this out.

274
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,689
(activating cat dog)

275
00:06:31,689 --> 00:06:33,907
Alright, so now we're gonna add just half of this.

276
00:06:33,907 --> 00:06:35,822
Next up we're adding one and half sticks of butter.

277
00:06:35,822 --> 00:06:38,820
Pop these out here. Let's see, come on come on, there we go.

278
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,036
- I'm gonna use these things.

279
00:06:40,036 --> 00:06:41,152
They look like a little alligator.

280
00:06:41,152 --> 00:06:42,518
Look at that, dude, perfect half.

281
00:06:42,518 --> 00:06:46,690
- Next up, we got a half a cup of instant dry milk powder.

282
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:48,356
Add it in. Next up we gotta add some water.

283
00:06:48,356 --> 00:06:49,465
So we need one eighth a cup and one half teaspoon.

284
00:06:49,465 --> 00:06:51,050
- [Devan] Okay, oh there we go, perfect.

285
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,811
- Then we gotta mix it, so here we go.

286
00:06:52,811 --> 00:06:54,345
Ooh yeah this is working.

287
00:06:54,345 --> 00:06:56,080
Next up, two cups of flour.

288
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,929
Time to mix it up, wait, but first I need a pinch of salt.

289
00:06:59,929 --> 00:07:00,762
(record stops)

290
00:07:00,762 --> 00:07:01,595
Like that!

291
00:07:01,595 --> 00:07:02,998
- I have a feeling you added way more salt than needed.

292
00:07:02,998 --> 00:07:04,240
- Next up it's time to bake these.

293
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,265
So, we're going to spread out the mixture here

294
00:07:06,265 --> 00:07:07,803
and make it into the shape of a poptart.

295
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:08,850
- You mean a rectangle?

296
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:09,869
- Yeah that's what I said.

297
00:07:09,869 --> 00:07:10,980
So we gotta go three two one

298
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:11,990
Nailed it!

299
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,243
Push down like that.

300
00:07:13,243 --> 00:07:14,744
I don't know how to make a rectangle to be honest.

301
00:07:14,744 --> 00:07:16,719
- This is the only thing that resembles a spatula.

302
00:07:16,719 --> 00:07:18,154
- You're gonna get hair in your food.

303
00:07:18,154 --> 00:07:19,683
Next up, we gotta bake these for 20 minutes

304
00:07:19,683 --> 00:07:21,004
at 302 degrees.

305
00:07:21,004 --> 00:07:22,306
- Wait, 302?

306
00:07:22,306 --> 00:07:23,753
What happens at 300 degrees?

307
00:07:23,753 --> 00:07:25,065
- It turns into a Snickers.

308
00:07:25,065 --> 00:07:25,898
- What?

309
00:07:25,898 --> 00:07:26,925
- Time to make the chocolate.

310
00:07:26,925 --> 00:07:28,339
So this is what we're gonna do,

311
00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:29,261
we're gonna leave the slinky in here.

312
00:07:29,261 --> 00:07:30,094
We're gonna pop these bags open

313
00:07:30,094 --> 00:07:31,333
You missed two of em, bro, what are you doing?

314
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:32,948
Next up, gotta fill this thing halfway with water

315
00:07:32,948 --> 00:07:35,253
so let's go, Devan, you can't throw me off there we go.

316
00:07:35,253 --> 00:07:37,906
- [Devan] And a switch, oh.

317
00:07:37,906 --> 00:07:39,565
- What, that's against the rules.

318
00:07:39,565 --> 00:07:40,398
- What rules?

319
00:07:40,398 --> 00:07:41,231
- Now time to melt down the chocolate.

320
00:07:41,231 --> 00:07:43,554
So we're gonna transfer these over here. Now it's time for

321
00:07:43,554 --> 00:07:44,726
- Spatulas!

322
00:07:44,726 --> 00:07:47,796
- And mix, dude I forgot I left my slinky in here.

323
00:07:47,796 --> 00:07:50,457
It's all part of it now, part of the DIY.

324
00:07:50,457 --> 00:07:52,084
Next, we're going to paint some chocolate

325
00:07:52,084 --> 00:07:52,917
on the parchment paper.

326
00:07:52,917 --> 00:07:53,866
So we got these lil paintbrushes over here.

327
00:07:53,866 --> 00:07:55,108
- Those aren't brushes.

328
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:56,136
- These are totally brushes.

329
00:07:56,136 --> 00:07:57,675
- This is a brush.

330
00:07:57,675 --> 00:07:58,800
- [Collins] Get the chocolate on here,

331
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,466
add it into the pan just like a taco.

332
00:08:01,466 --> 00:08:02,952
Fully nailing it over here bro.

333
00:08:02,952 --> 00:08:04,558
This is just next level saucery.

334
00:08:04,558 --> 00:08:06,678
Let's go the old fashioned way we'll use the uh

335
00:08:06,678 --> 00:08:08,461
classic and trusted true method

336
00:08:08,461 --> 00:08:09,856
of the slinky on the paper technique.

337
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:10,689
Thanks slinky.

338
00:08:10,689 --> 00:08:12,478
- Alright, my second sheet is done.

339
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:14,540
Now it's time to plop it next to it.

340
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,856
- There we go, yup just like that.

341
00:08:15,856 --> 00:08:17,510
Just oooh.

342
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,697
- [Devan] This is more like performance art

343
00:08:19,697 --> 00:08:20,530
than anything else.

344
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:21,669
- Next up I'm going to be using some carmel,

345
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:24,169
but to use pre made carmel would be to easy. So yeeee

346
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:25,737
- [Devin] Oh geez.

347
00:08:25,737 --> 00:08:26,768
- We're actually going to make carmel from scratch.

348
00:08:26,768 --> 00:08:29,430
So first up, we got some heavy whipping cream.

349
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,599
Alright gotta add one cup of this stuff, boom.

350
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:32,902
Next up, we got a half cup of whole milk.

351
00:08:32,902 --> 00:08:34,678
- Next up we add one cup corn syrup.

352
00:08:34,678 --> 00:08:36,058
Wait, no, dude that's mom's soap.

353
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:36,910
What are you doing?

354
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:37,863
- It's the corn syrup cat, bro.

355
00:08:37,863 --> 00:08:39,447
You know what corn syrup can and

356
00:08:39,447 --> 00:08:41,141
ambiguous chihuahua cat dog should be friends.

357
00:08:41,141 --> 00:08:42,802
Cause I mean, look at them.

358
00:08:42,802 --> 00:08:44,133
- Next up is one and a half a cup of powdered sugar.

359
00:08:44,133 --> 00:08:45,436
I sense this is about to spill.

360
00:08:45,436 --> 00:08:46,778
- [Collins] You got this all over my hands.

361
00:08:46,778 --> 00:08:47,711
- [Devan] Sorry dude.

362
00:08:47,711 --> 00:08:49,429
- And now it's time for some sorcery,

363
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:51,047
as this stuff turns into carmel.

364
00:08:51,047 --> 00:08:52,293
So we're gonna pop it on the stove.

365
00:08:52,293 --> 00:08:53,841
(magical whirring)

366
00:08:53,841 --> 00:08:55,070
Alright the caramel is done and now

367
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:55,983
- Wait, carmel.

368
00:08:55,983 --> 00:08:57,113
- Carmel? Caramel?

369
00:08:57,113 --> 00:08:58,140
- I think you mean carmel.

370
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,443
Alright so now we're going to pour it in here to the molds.

371
00:08:59,443 --> 00:09:00,785
Biscuits are done and now it's time for lazer eyes.

372
00:09:00,785 --> 00:09:02,615
(lazers beaming)

373
00:09:02,615 --> 00:09:03,448
Bam, nailed it.

374
00:09:03,448 --> 00:09:05,176
Unfortunately I only have one lazer eyes per day,

375
00:09:05,176 --> 00:09:07,689
but I will give you the pineapple of destiny!

376
00:09:07,689 --> 00:09:09,491
Boom, nailed it!

377
00:09:09,491 --> 00:09:11,341
Now it's time to take a slice of your biscuit,

378
00:09:11,341 --> 00:09:13,786
Now you're going to lay it in one half of the twix thingy.

379
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:15,668
There ya go, alright so now we gotta get uh

380
00:09:15,668 --> 00:09:16,502
side two over here.

381
00:09:16,502 --> 00:09:17,531
Oh no, I broke it!

382
00:09:17,531 --> 00:09:18,985
Luckily, we got extras.

383
00:09:18,985 --> 00:09:20,533
Oh, no broke another one.

384
00:09:20,533 --> 00:09:21,942
This is my last good piece.

385
00:09:21,942 --> 00:09:23,405
Tada!

386
00:09:23,405 --> 00:09:24,238
- Why would you throw it?

387
00:09:24,238 --> 00:09:25,125
- Now it's time to pop these into the refrigerator

388
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:25,958
and cool em down.

389
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:27,337
But first, we can use a little bit of water to cool em down.

390
00:09:27,337 --> 00:09:29,854
- No you're gonna ruin it, bro, dude. What are you doing?

391
00:09:29,854 --> 00:09:31,119
- A nice little mist.

392
00:09:31,119 --> 00:09:32,068
Bad Devan.

393
00:09:32,068 --> 00:09:33,625
Alright now it's time to pop these in the fridge.

394
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:34,615
Here's the big reveal!

395
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:35,523
- Three two

396
00:09:35,523 --> 00:09:37,754
- But first, if you wanna win a 15 minute video call

397
00:09:37,754 --> 00:09:42,004
from Devan and I, text the word key to 81800 right now.

398
00:09:42,004 --> 00:09:44,139
Pause the video, text the word key to 81800

399
00:09:44,139 --> 00:09:46,093
then come right back and let's see how this thing looks.

400
00:09:46,093 --> 00:09:46,926
Ready?

401
00:09:46,926 --> 00:09:48,091
- Three two One tada!

402
00:09:48,091 --> 00:09:49,880
- Dude, what happened?

403
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,402
- I mean I did the best I could.

404
00:09:51,402 --> 00:09:53,384
Something a little wrong.

405
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,961
But I mean yours, bro, looks like a legit giant twix.

406
00:09:55,961 --> 00:09:57,066
- [Devan] It looks so good.

407
00:09:57,066 --> 00:09:58,678
- Yo, we gotta break it open.

408
00:09:58,678 --> 00:09:59,659
- Whoa dude, you're so right.

409
00:09:59,659 --> 00:10:00,770
Alright alright ready, here we go.

410
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:01,679
Three, two one.

411
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:03,845
Oh it's tough, my thumbs aren't powerful enough.

412
00:10:03,845 --> 00:10:04,678
- Oh!

413
00:10:05,729 --> 00:10:07,028
- [Devan] It's like a rocky road.

414
00:10:07,028 --> 00:10:07,861
- What?

415
00:10:07,861 --> 00:10:08,694
- It's like a bridge.

416
00:10:08,694 --> 00:10:10,690
- I've gotta crack one of mine open, so here we go ya ready?

417
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:12,357
- Three two one, oh!

418
00:10:14,415 --> 00:10:17,261
- Alright guys, we'll be eating this at the end of the video

419
00:10:17,261 --> 00:10:18,452
Comment down below who made the better one,

420
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:19,925
and right now we are on to the next one.

421
00:10:19,925 --> 00:10:22,275
You challenged us to make a giant Skittle.

422
00:10:22,275 --> 00:10:26,020
(both talking in fear)

423
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,100
- Bro, get behind me, I got you.

424
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,144
Yo, who sent that? - And where did it come from?

425
00:10:30,144 --> 00:10:31,802
- Step number one for the giant skittle,

426
00:10:31,802 --> 00:10:34,372
is have to have exactly two coconuts of corn syrup.

427
00:10:34,372 --> 00:10:35,205
- Wait what?

428
00:10:35,205 --> 00:10:36,296
How much is that?

429
00:10:36,296 --> 00:10:39,268
- If you get it wrong, you won't get it right.

430
00:10:39,268 --> 00:10:40,101
Alright, cocunut.

431
00:10:40,101 --> 00:10:41,624
Ya gotta get the magic wand to to move this thing around.

432
00:10:41,624 --> 00:10:42,563
Here ya go come on out.

433
00:10:42,563 --> 00:10:43,940
Uh oh, I lost my coconut top in it.

434
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:44,840
(bottle squelching)

435
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,787
That sounds disgusting, bro.

436
00:10:45,787 --> 00:10:47,071
- Two coconuts is not precise.

437
00:10:47,071 --> 00:10:51,049
- Next up you are going to add one lego man of sugar.

438
00:10:51,049 --> 00:10:51,882
- [Devan] A lego man?

439
00:10:51,882 --> 00:10:53,363
How is anyone gonna follow this at home?

440
00:10:53,363 --> 00:10:55,340
- Next up, you need to add 40 squirts of vegetable oil.

441
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,697
- Wait 40 squorts?

442
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:57,530
- Yup so

443
00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:00,113
(counts to 40)

444
00:11:01,084 --> 00:11:03,055
now it's time to mix it, so here we go.

445
00:11:03,055 --> 00:11:04,142
It's gonna go in here.

446
00:11:04,142 --> 00:11:05,351
- Well I don't see a shovel.

447
00:11:05,351 --> 00:11:06,667
- Find one or make one.

448
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:08,577
- [Devan] I guess this is the closest to a shovel.

449
00:11:08,577 --> 00:11:09,794
There we go!

450
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,665
It's dusting off the sugar.

451
00:11:11,665 --> 00:11:12,802
- Time to pop these on the stove.

452
00:11:12,802 --> 00:11:15,066
Now we gotta heat it up to 265 degrees.

453
00:11:15,066 --> 00:11:16,662
Very hot, be very careful,

454
00:11:16,662 --> 00:11:17,915
and maybe even have someone help you with this

455
00:11:17,915 --> 00:11:20,074
because it is very very hot. So we're gonna dump it in here,

456
00:11:20,074 --> 00:11:21,925
now go to this one over here, boop. Make sure they're equal.

457
00:11:21,925 --> 00:11:24,212
This is the delicious inside of the skittle.

458
00:11:24,212 --> 00:11:25,399
So now time to pop these in the fridge.

459
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:27,039
The hard shell coating is super easy.

460
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:29,163
You start off with one golden pineapple.

461
00:11:29,163 --> 00:11:29,996
- Dude!

462
00:11:29,996 --> 00:11:30,829
- Of corn syrup.

463
00:11:30,829 --> 00:11:32,348
- [Devan] So how much is that, exactly?

464
00:11:32,348 --> 00:11:33,574
- This is one golden pineapple of corn,

465
00:11:33,574 --> 00:11:34,492
I've already said this, bro.

466
00:11:34,492 --> 00:11:36,659
For the sugar, you're going to need a brand new

467
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:37,988
size 12 shoe.

468
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:39,321
Fill it up, and that's exactly

469
00:11:39,321 --> 00:11:40,341
the amount of sugar you'll need for this.

470
00:11:40,341 --> 00:11:41,174
- [Devin] What?

471
00:11:41,174 --> 00:11:42,428
- It's what happens when you go to the beach,

472
00:11:42,428 --> 00:11:43,389
and you get a whole bunch of sand in your shoes.

473
00:11:43,389 --> 00:11:45,071
And one the sugar is added it's time to mix it up.

474
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:47,591
- It's like four cups of sugar, I'm guessing.

475
00:11:47,591 --> 00:11:49,212
- The fun part about using the golden pineapple measurement,

476
00:11:49,212 --> 00:11:50,703
is you can use the top of the golden pineapple

477
00:11:50,703 --> 00:11:51,547
as a little mixer.

478
00:11:51,547 --> 00:11:53,506
So you're gonna pop this in here and mix it up.

479
00:11:53,506 --> 00:11:55,105
- [Devan] This thing sounds like a chipmunk

480
00:11:55,105 --> 00:11:56,155
on a unicycle.

481
00:11:56,155 --> 00:11:57,384
- That's the good thing about the golden pineapple,

482
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:58,384
it never makes a noise.

483
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,509
(grunting)

484
00:11:59,509 --> 00:12:01,679
Alright now it's time to pop these on the stove.

485
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,800
The mixture has now boiled to 300 degrees

486
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,091
and now it's time to add the coloring.

487
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:07,094
So now we're adding both white and green

488
00:12:07,094 --> 00:12:08,254
to give it a more skittlish color.

489
00:12:08,254 --> 00:12:10,119
Now it's time to mix the food coloring in.

490
00:12:10,119 --> 00:12:11,173
I do not want mine to be sour,

491
00:12:11,173 --> 00:12:12,624
cuz I do not want a sour skittle.

492
00:12:12,624 --> 00:12:14,034
Alright it's time to set up for our next part.

493
00:12:14,034 --> 00:12:15,601
So right now, we're going to flip these bowls over.

494
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:16,434
- What,what?

495
00:12:16,434 --> 00:12:17,826
You do not have to flip the bowls over by the way.

496
00:12:17,826 --> 00:12:19,492
You can just do it like this, it's a better base.

497
00:12:19,492 --> 00:12:20,709
- Very quickly,

498
00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:21,741
so gotta take the inside of the skittle right now

499
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,650
and we gotta remove the wrap around it.

500
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,450
- We have to peel this off very carefully.

501
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:26,656
- Now you put the

502
00:12:26,656 --> 00:12:27,595
(bowl drops on counter)

503
00:12:27,595 --> 00:12:28,428
right over here.

504
00:12:28,428 --> 00:12:30,201
- [Devin] Now you put the paper on top of the other bowl.

505
00:12:30,201 --> 00:12:31,316
- Now this next part,

506
00:12:31,316 --> 00:12:33,248
you need to be extremely careful

507
00:12:33,248 --> 00:12:34,980
because this is very very hot.

508
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,743
So even maybe even ask for someone else's help.

509
00:12:36,743 --> 00:12:38,226
But we've got some protective gloves right now

510
00:12:38,226 --> 00:12:40,608
and it's time to dump the skittle hard shell coating

511
00:12:40,608 --> 00:12:41,736
onto the inside.

512
00:12:41,736 --> 00:12:42,915
- Three two one

513
00:12:42,915 --> 00:12:44,460
Whoa!

514
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,281
Oh my goodness!

515
00:12:46,281 --> 00:12:47,849
- [Collins] This is the closest I've ever been

516
00:12:47,849 --> 00:12:48,808
to being a real chef.

517
00:12:48,808 --> 00:12:50,786
Oooooooo it's nice!

518
00:12:50,786 --> 00:12:51,996
The two halves are out of the fridge.

519
00:12:51,996 --> 00:12:52,829
If you guys can tell,

520
00:12:52,829 --> 00:12:54,139
I gotta little bit of a mound right there.

521
00:12:54,139 --> 00:12:55,377
So here we go, let's line em up

522
00:12:55,377 --> 00:12:56,380
and then push them together.

523
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,575
Three two one go

524
00:12:57,575 --> 00:13:00,242
(both grunting)

525
00:13:01,107 --> 00:13:02,399
And now it's time to put the S for skittles.

526
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,062
Or for Collins, because everyone forgets there's an S

527
00:13:05,062 --> 00:13:06,392
on my name, it's Collins with an S.

528
00:13:06,392 --> 00:13:07,525
I gotta place the S down like this.

529
00:13:07,525 --> 00:13:09,162
I've got this silver spray right here,

530
00:13:09,162 --> 00:13:09,995
which is edible.

531
00:13:09,995 --> 00:13:11,874
- [Devan] Oh, oh oh you gotta keep it down.

532
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:12,707
- That was horrible.

533
00:13:12,707 --> 00:13:15,248
That's a spittle it's like a splatted skittle man.

534
00:13:15,248 --> 00:13:16,081
Here are the giant skittles.

535
00:13:16,081 --> 00:13:16,914
Bro we did it!

536
00:13:16,914 --> 00:13:18,859
So you get to comment down below who made a better one.

537
00:13:18,859 --> 00:13:20,574
We'll be eating these at the end of the video

538
00:13:20,574 --> 00:13:23,530
and right now it is on to the next round.

539
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:26,165
You challenged us to make a giant taffy.

540
00:13:26,165 --> 00:13:27,755
So yeee let's go.

541
00:13:27,755 --> 00:13:29,071
- I got it.

542
00:13:29,071 --> 00:13:30,445
- First step, you gotta use some sugar.

543
00:13:30,445 --> 00:13:31,839
- Why is there a pool noodle on here?

544
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,153
- Well because, hey hey set it back over here.

545
00:13:34,153 --> 00:13:35,892
Alright so now we need two cups of sugar.

546
00:13:35,892 --> 00:13:37,066
So we gotta get these out of here.

547
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,850
Pop this open, alright let's see, oh

548
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:39,683
what am I doing?

549
00:13:39,683 --> 00:13:40,516
- [Devan] I got it I got it.

550
00:13:40,516 --> 00:13:43,592
- Next up we got three tablespoons of cornstarch.

551
00:13:43,592 --> 00:13:45,706
- One two and three.

552
00:13:45,706 --> 00:13:47,264
- Next up we got one and a third cup of water.

553
00:13:47,264 --> 00:13:48,813
So we got the noodle, and we gotta be very careful

554
00:13:48,813 --> 00:13:49,646
with how this goes.

555
00:13:49,646 --> 00:13:52,463
This is called pool noodle purification.

556
00:13:52,463 --> 00:13:54,363
- [Devan] No it actually worked?

557
00:13:54,363 --> 00:13:56,935
(Collins blowing water through the noodle)

558
00:13:56,935 --> 00:13:58,073
It's a round a bout way of,

559
00:13:58,073 --> 00:13:59,708
dude get it over the thing.

560
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:00,541
- That didn't work.

561
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:02,207
- Next up, we add one cup of corn syrup.

562
00:14:02,207 --> 00:14:03,592
- Corn syrup or corn swap!

563
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:06,515
- Alright so add one cup of this.

564
00:14:06,515 --> 00:14:07,442
- Corn swap.

565
00:14:07,442 --> 00:14:09,294
- Next up we take this bulldozer and add

566
00:14:09,294 --> 00:14:10,659
two tablespoons of butter.

567
00:14:10,659 --> 00:14:11,492
So you just

568
00:14:11,492 --> 00:14:12,325
(butter splashes in bowl)

569
00:14:12,325 --> 00:14:13,557
- [Collins] Scoop it up, pop it right over there.

570
00:14:13,557 --> 00:14:17,745
We got to chop two tablespoons of butter here we go.

571
00:14:17,745 --> 00:14:18,578
- That works.

572
00:14:18,578 --> 00:14:19,959
- Next up, we got a little thermometer,

573
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:20,902
so we gotta check my temp

574
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:22,741
- Dude your 150 degrees right now.

575
00:14:22,741 --> 00:14:23,574
- What?

576
00:14:23,574 --> 00:14:24,407
- You have a fever?

577
00:14:24,407 --> 00:14:25,240
- I'm hot!

578
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,241
Alright we're gonna clip these here on the inside.

579
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:27,193
Pop these on the stove.

580
00:14:27,193 --> 00:14:28,676
Oh mine's a little messy, I gotta.

581
00:14:28,676 --> 00:14:30,532
- [Devan] I gotchu fam I gotchu fam.

582
00:14:30,532 --> 00:14:32,091
Oh your paper's still on the butter.

583
00:14:32,091 --> 00:14:33,998
- Alright it's time to add some Kool-Aid packets in

584
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,287
which you're gonna add the color to match the flavor.

585
00:14:35,287 --> 00:14:37,201
Oh snap it's bubbling up, bro, it's bubbling up!

586
00:14:37,201 --> 00:14:38,550
Next up we get the parchment paper.

587
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:40,178
Oh snap, what is happening?

588
00:14:40,178 --> 00:14:41,493
- Don't come towards me.

589
00:14:41,493 --> 00:14:43,998
- Alright so now we're gonna lay this parchment paper

590
00:14:43,998 --> 00:14:46,359
right over here. - All of that for just that?

591
00:14:46,359 --> 00:14:47,588
Dude, how am I gonna do this?

592
00:14:47,588 --> 00:14:48,853
This isn't really working out.

593
00:14:48,853 --> 00:14:50,305
- Well you gotta work better stronger.

594
00:14:50,305 --> 00:14:51,570
Do better at your job!

595
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:52,665
- It's open.

596
00:14:52,665 --> 00:14:54,652
Why are there so many safety precautions?

597
00:14:54,652 --> 00:14:55,485
- Smells great.

598
00:14:55,485 --> 00:14:56,631
- Alright, it's looking good.

599
00:14:56,631 --> 00:14:57,811
- [Collins] You should use a dumptruck

600
00:14:57,811 --> 00:14:58,920
to pour the rest of it in there.

601
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,061
- Oh I totally should!

602
00:15:00,061 --> 00:15:00,894
- I got good ideas.

603
00:15:00,894 --> 00:15:01,727
Yo!

604
00:15:01,727 --> 00:15:02,560
- [Devin] Yes!

605
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,741
- The mixture has set and now it's time

606
00:15:03,741 --> 00:15:05,069
to turn this candy into taffy.

607
00:15:05,069 --> 00:15:06,171
So here we go, bam.

608
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:07,207
- Dude look at this.

609
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:08,040
- Whoa!

610
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:08,873
Oh!

611
00:15:08,873 --> 00:15:10,026
- Mickey mouse press.

612
00:15:10,026 --> 00:15:12,159
(grunts)

613
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:12,992
- Hulk smash.

614
00:15:12,992 --> 00:15:13,825
Nothing!

615
00:15:13,825 --> 00:15:16,184
Hulk stuck, get off me taffy!

616
00:15:16,184 --> 00:15:18,071
It's actually like a lot harder to do this than you think.

617
00:15:18,071 --> 00:15:20,686
But like I'm gonna give it a little twist.

618
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:23,557
I thought the dump truck would have a lot more effect.

619
00:15:23,557 --> 00:15:24,404
If that's what it does to the tongs,

620
00:15:24,404 --> 00:15:25,540
what's this gonna do to your teeth, bro?

621
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:28,031
- Oh no, my glove, it broke my glove.

622
00:15:28,031 --> 00:15:29,697
It put a hole in my glove!

623
00:15:29,697 --> 00:15:31,530
- Alright here we go it's gonna get em up get em up.

624
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:32,862
- Gimme gimme gimme.

625
00:15:32,862 --> 00:15:35,572
- Dude this taffy turned out so cool.

626
00:15:35,572 --> 00:15:36,819
You get to comment down below

627
00:15:36,819 --> 00:15:38,077
who's taffy turned out better.

628
00:15:38,077 --> 00:15:40,361
We'll be eating these giant taffies at the end of the video,

629
00:15:40,361 --> 00:15:42,138
but right now, we are on to the next round.

630
00:15:42,138 --> 00:15:43,654
Alright I'm just ready to take a bite of this thing.

631
00:15:43,654 --> 00:15:44,712
- I wanna break mine in half.

632
00:15:44,712 --> 00:15:45,803
- Oh dude, break it in half.

633
00:15:45,803 --> 00:15:47,497
Can you even do it, bro?

634
00:15:47,497 --> 00:15:51,026
Alright here we go, three two one.

635
00:15:51,026 --> 00:15:51,859
Ohhh!

636
00:15:51,859 --> 00:15:53,100
Snap!

637
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:53,933
And then

638
00:15:53,933 --> 00:15:54,957
(teeth hit something hard)

639
00:15:54,957 --> 00:15:55,898
whoa!

640
00:15:55,898 --> 00:15:57,579
- [Devan] The little ones inside.

641
00:15:57,579 --> 00:15:59,569
- I forgot about the little like mini Reese's pieces.

642
00:15:59,569 --> 00:16:00,444
- So good!

643
00:16:00,444 --> 00:16:03,643
(talking with mouth full)

644
00:16:03,643 --> 00:16:04,707
- We're gonna eat these things right now!

645
00:16:04,707 --> 00:16:05,540
- What?

646
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,873
- Three two one.

647
00:16:08,656 --> 00:16:10,322
(screams of enjoyment)

648
00:16:10,322 --> 00:16:11,655
This is Amazing!

649
00:16:15,685 --> 00:16:17,499
- And now it's time to eat the giant edible skittles.

650
00:16:17,499 --> 00:16:19,431
Dude the inside looks amazing!

651
00:16:19,431 --> 00:16:20,264
- Oh my.

652
00:16:20,264 --> 00:16:24,503
- Alright, now my turn to crack it, here we go. (grunting)

653
00:16:24,503 --> 00:16:25,812
Oh man I'm out of geez.

654
00:16:25,812 --> 00:16:26,978
Let's see how the thing tastes,

655
00:16:26,978 --> 00:16:28,898
you ready, here we go.

656
00:16:28,898 --> 00:16:29,731
Oh wow.

657
00:16:29,731 --> 00:16:30,564
- Oh wow.

658
00:16:30,564 --> 00:16:31,854
This is insane.

659
00:16:31,854 --> 00:16:32,964
