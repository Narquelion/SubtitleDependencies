1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,833
- What's up everyone?

2
00:00:00,833 --> 00:00:03,835
It's Collins Key and welcome to the Thursday blog.

3
00:00:03,835 --> 00:00:05,724
You probably saw the title and thought to yourself.

4
00:00:05,724 --> 00:00:06,557
Hold up.

5
00:00:06,557 --> 00:00:10,076
Collins Key is the most manly man in the entire world.

6
00:00:10,076 --> 00:00:11,302
I wish I could say that was true

7
00:00:11,302 --> 00:00:12,865
but just like everyone else.

8
00:00:12,865 --> 00:00:14,842
There are some things that freak me out.

9
00:00:14,842 --> 00:00:16,653
So if you're excited to find out what freaks me out.

10
00:00:16,653 --> 00:00:20,150
Let me know by liking this video and let's get started.

11
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:20,983
Spiders.

12
00:00:20,983 --> 00:00:23,310
I honestly don't know why I don't like spiders.

13
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,665
Besides the fact that they freaking bite people.

14
00:00:25,665 --> 00:00:27,500
People die, they eat bugs.

15
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,653
They have weird creepy legs.

16
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:31,350
They shoot webs out of their butt, which is just weird.

17
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:32,364
Scary movies.

18
00:00:32,364 --> 00:00:33,760
Personally I don't like to be in fear.

19
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,494
I don't understand the joy of being in complete

20
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:39,156
and utter terror for an entire hour and a half.

21
00:00:39,156 --> 00:00:42,469
Let alone paying like 12 bucks to go to a movie theater

22
00:00:42,469 --> 00:00:43,822
and be terrified.

23
00:00:43,822 --> 00:00:45,173
I've never heard someone say,

24
00:00:45,173 --> 00:00:48,585
"Oh man, I'm so happy after I leave a horror movie.

25
00:00:48,585 --> 00:00:49,870
"They're the best.

26
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:51,474
"If you're ever having a bad day.

27
00:00:51,474 --> 00:00:53,664
"You should watch The Conjuring."

28
00:00:53,664 --> 00:00:56,824
I will never take a girl on a date to a scary movie

29
00:00:56,824 --> 00:00:58,245
because we're gonna be sitting there in the theater.

30
00:00:58,245 --> 00:01:00,386
And she's gonna be like, "Awww cute, a scary movie.

31
00:01:00,386 --> 00:01:01,653
"That way I can lean up against him.

32
00:01:01,653 --> 00:01:02,739
"I can cuddle with him

33
00:01:02,739 --> 00:01:04,964
"and then he'll protect me from all the scariness."

34
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:05,797
No.

35
00:01:05,797 --> 00:01:06,890
The exact opposite will happen.

36
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:07,902
I'll be sitting there in my chair,

37
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:09,841
ready to punch anything that comes close to me.

38
00:01:09,841 --> 00:01:12,359
And if God forbid, you decide to snuggle at this moment

39
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:14,110
and I feel something start grabbing my arm.

40
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:15,067
You know what's gonna happen.

41
00:01:15,067 --> 00:01:16,984
I'll be like Chris Brown, Poow.

42
00:01:16,984 --> 00:01:20,410
I don't know why but I'm still sometimes scared of the dark.

43
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:22,107
Which is really stupid.

44
00:01:22,107 --> 00:01:22,940
Blood.

45
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:23,773
Okay, that's kind of a funny one

46
00:01:23,773 --> 00:01:25,681
I never really share with a lot of people

47
00:01:25,681 --> 00:01:28,350
but I don't like blood and it's only my blood.

48
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,065
Someone could be laying on the ground right over there

49
00:01:30,065 --> 00:01:30,996
and they're just bleeding out.

50
00:01:30,996 --> 00:01:31,937
I'll be totally calm.

51
00:01:31,937 --> 00:01:32,770
Be like, you what do you need?

52
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:33,603
You want a juice box?

53
00:01:33,603 --> 00:01:34,784
So I'll be totally cool about it.

54
00:01:34,784 --> 00:01:38,080
If I see so much like a drop of my own blood.

55
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,535
I'll be like, something is seriously wrong.

56
00:01:40,535 --> 00:01:42,231
Taking out the trash at night.

57
00:01:42,231 --> 00:01:44,304
The moment I stepped outside.

58
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:46,294
It goes into like horror movie mode.

59
00:01:46,294 --> 00:01:48,825
It gets to a point where I'll check the trash cans

60
00:01:48,825 --> 00:01:51,672
because I think there like people hiding in the trash cans.

61
00:01:51,672 --> 00:01:53,552
I feel like I'm in the middle of The Purge.

62
00:01:53,552 --> 00:01:55,322
When I have to take out those trash cans at night.

63
00:01:55,322 --> 00:01:57,056
I'm like, this is completely anarchy.

64
00:01:57,056 --> 00:01:58,213
Anything could happen.

65
00:01:58,213 --> 00:01:59,957
Don't make me hit you with a trash bag.

66
00:01:59,957 --> 00:02:02,205
Also let's combine two of my least favorite things.

67
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:03,978
Spiders and trash cans.

68
00:02:03,978 --> 00:02:06,165
Because our trash can have spiders.

69
00:02:06,165 --> 00:02:07,296
How awesome is that?

70
00:02:07,296 --> 00:02:08,802
When guys don't wash their hands

71
00:02:08,802 --> 00:02:10,175
when they leave the rest room.

72
00:02:10,175 --> 00:02:12,408
Yes ladies, it happens.

73
00:02:12,408 --> 00:02:15,122
An estimated 80% of men leave the restroom

74
00:02:15,122 --> 00:02:16,686
without washing their hands.

75
00:02:16,686 --> 00:02:17,728
I always wash my hand.

76
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,769
I'll use paper towels to open the door.

77
00:02:19,769 --> 00:02:20,602
Clowns.

78
00:02:20,602 --> 00:02:21,713
Who likes clowns?

79
00:02:21,713 --> 00:02:23,166
I have yet to hear someone say,

80
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:24,484
"I love clowns.

81
00:02:24,484 --> 00:02:26,332
"I'm a big proponent of clowns."

82
00:02:26,332 --> 00:02:28,680
I think the only people who like clowns are clowns.

83
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,719
Like for real, how do they still have jobs?

84
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:31,852
Garbage disposals.

85
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:33,701
I don't know why but from a young age.

86
00:02:33,701 --> 00:02:35,613
I've had this unrational fear

87
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,149
that I'm gonna lose one of my hands

88
00:02:37,149 --> 00:02:39,109
in a freak garbage disposal accident.

89
00:02:39,109 --> 00:02:40,544
And then I find out that you're actually not suppose to

90
00:02:40,544 --> 00:02:42,555
put anything in the garbage disposal.

91
00:02:42,555 --> 00:02:44,752
Like eggs or orange peels or any of that stuff

92
00:02:44,752 --> 00:02:47,113
because apparently it's bad for garbage disposal.

93
00:02:47,113 --> 00:02:48,810
And then I'm like, well what the heck is the point

94
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,066
of a garbage disposal if you can't dispose of stuff?

95
00:02:51,066 --> 00:02:51,899
I don't know.

96
00:02:51,899 --> 00:02:52,798
Forgetting about homework.

97
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:54,601
And then you realize you have two options.

98
00:02:54,601 --> 00:02:56,292
Option number one,

99
00:02:56,292 --> 00:02:58,267
you can do your best to complete the homework

100
00:02:58,267 --> 00:02:59,725
or option number two.

101
00:02:59,725 --> 00:03:00,558
Which is what I do.

102
00:03:00,558 --> 00:03:02,696
Go on YouTube, start watching tutorial videos

103
00:03:02,696 --> 00:03:04,746
about the project and then slowly

104
00:03:04,746 --> 00:03:07,488
but surely I end up watching fail videos.

105
00:03:07,488 --> 00:03:09,015
I really don't know how it happens.

106
00:03:09,015 --> 00:03:11,402
And last thing on my list is moldy food.

107
00:03:11,402 --> 00:03:12,235
When I was a kid,

108
00:03:12,235 --> 00:03:14,404
our mom would always have jars of apple sauce,

109
00:03:14,404 --> 00:03:17,478
and if she found mold on the top of the apple sauce.

110
00:03:17,478 --> 00:03:19,416
She would just scoop out the parts of mold

111
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:20,867
and then have us eat the rest.

112
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,408
And then we found out the worst part about mold

113
00:03:23,408 --> 00:03:24,762
is not actually what's on the top.

114
00:03:24,762 --> 00:03:26,823
It's the fact that the mold spores go down

115
00:03:26,823 --> 00:03:28,614
all the way into the food.

116
00:03:28,614 --> 00:03:30,487
And the lower and deeper you get.

117
00:03:30,487 --> 00:03:32,267
The more mold spores there are.

118
00:03:32,267 --> 00:03:33,989
Now whenever I see mold, I'm like,

119
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:35,140
I'm not gonna eat that.

120
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,462
Nope, don't scrape it off the top.

121
00:03:36,462 --> 00:03:37,402
Don't even try that.

122
00:03:37,402 --> 00:03:38,312
I ain't gonna eat it.

123
00:03:38,312 --> 00:03:40,235
But even if I see food that looks remotely bad.

124
00:03:40,235 --> 00:03:43,625
I'm like, yow this lettuce looks a little bit soggy.

125
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:46,432
I can't, I can't eat that, I can't.

126
00:03:46,432 --> 00:03:47,265
Alright now, if any of those things

127
00:03:47,265 --> 00:03:49,079
that I've just named off also freak you out.

128
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:51,136
Let me know by liking this video.

129
00:03:51,136 --> 00:03:52,573
This Saturday, I've got a super special

130
00:03:52,573 --> 00:03:55,159
surprise collab video that's gonna be coming out.

131
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:57,225
And also I want you guys to comment down below

132
00:03:57,225 --> 00:03:58,076
and let me know.

133
00:03:58,076 --> 00:03:59,868
What freaks you out?

134
00:03:59,868 --> 00:04:02,386
The most creative will get shout out in next week's vlog.

135
00:04:02,386 --> 00:04:04,640
Don't forget of course subscribe to this channel

136
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,380
and I'll see you guys on Saturday.

137
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,797
Peace.

138
00:04:07,797 --> 00:04:10,547
(dramatic music)

139
00:04:17,938 --> 00:04:19,006
I'm always tweeting or texting

140
00:04:19,006 --> 00:04:21,401
or Instagramming or Snapchatting.

141
00:04:21,401 --> 00:04:22,300
I lie about the last part.

142
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,844
My Snapchat game is really weak.
