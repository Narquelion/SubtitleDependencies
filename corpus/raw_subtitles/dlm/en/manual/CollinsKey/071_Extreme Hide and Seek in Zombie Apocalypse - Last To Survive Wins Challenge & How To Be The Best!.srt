1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,700
- These are real life zombies,

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,500
because you challenged us to play hide and seek

3
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,500
with zombies here at Two-Bit Circus.

4
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,810
But here's the twist, if the zombies find and tag us,

5
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:10,110
we get turned into zombies and join the herd.

6
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,274
Last man standing wins and the clock starts now.

7
00:00:12,274 --> 00:00:13,107
(bell rings) Let's Go!

8
00:00:13,107 --> 00:00:13,940
- [Ben] What? - Alright guys,

9
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,383
let's find some hiding spots, let's do this.

10
00:00:15,383 --> 00:00:17,271
(group exclaims excitedly)

11
00:00:17,271 --> 00:00:19,340
- [Nina] Oh my gosh, this is amazing.

12
00:00:20,193 --> 00:00:21,026
- Holy cow!

13
00:00:21,026 --> 00:00:22,430
Alright well, everyone's going that way,

14
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:23,530
I'm going this way.

15
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:24,810
No one's gonna find me.

16
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,270
- Look at this, what?

17
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:27,103
What do you think?

18
00:00:27,103 --> 00:00:27,936
Can you tell that it's me?

19
00:00:27,936 --> 00:00:30,140
- Look at that face that is insane.

20
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,210
That's really cool.

21
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:32,450
- Maybe I can do something where I can like

22
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:34,700
hide under the chair, maybe under this?

23
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,300
That would be kinda cool. (door creaks)

24
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,530
- I heard someone.

25
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:38,410
Let's find the others.

26
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:40,010
(screams)

27
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:41,810
- [Alexis] Please! - Hide!

28
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:44,109
- Oh my gosh, he needs to help us Lindsay.

29
00:00:44,109 --> 00:00:45,037
- All right we're going upstairs.

30
00:00:45,037 --> 00:00:46,870
No body's gonna find me up here.

31
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,030
Oh man, I don't know what to do.

32
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:51,180
- Yo guys, Yo guys, behind here

33
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,025
I think I may have found my hiding spot.

34
00:00:53,025 --> 00:00:55,067
(leaves rustling)

35
00:00:55,067 --> 00:00:56,530
- And one other thing I forgot to mention is that,

36
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:58,330
whenever the siren of terror goes off,

37
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:00,150
we have to switch hiding spots immediately.

38
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,650
- Wow, this place has so many hidden treasures,

39
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:03,769
this is crazy.

40
00:01:03,769 --> 00:01:05,060
- Whoa, what are you doing there?

41
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,760
- What are you doing here?

42
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,593
- Money's on Bella,

43
00:01:07,593 --> 00:01:08,530
she'll be the first one turned into a zombie.

44
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:10,850
- You're super tall, I'm little n' speedy.

45
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:12,080
- [Lindsay] That's like not gonna work.

46
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,130
Oh oh can you hold this?

47
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:14,230
Guys I think I found it.

48
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,767
- [Nina] Okay, no.

49
00:01:15,767 --> 00:01:17,660
- I mean I can hide in the trashcan.

50
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,790
Throw myself with trash, that may work.

51
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:21,230
- If you can hide up in here, that would be nuts man.

52
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:24,640
Just like spider-manned out. (screams)

53
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,820
- Oh maybe behind the box.

54
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,660
Nope, but I could get a soda.

55
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,520
I don't want a soda but I could if I wanted to.

56
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,980
I know the object is there.

57
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,076
- [Devan] Ben, look at Ben, he's just running man.

58
00:01:33,076 --> 00:01:35,111
(silly noise crashing)

59
00:01:35,111 --> 00:01:36,010
- Oh sorry!

60
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:36,960
- If we both come in here,

61
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,280
it'll be like we're both in the womb again.

62
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,790
- [Lindsay] I can't fit under there, let's go.

63
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:42,790
- Oh, maybe I can hide behind the pillar.

64
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:43,890
Yeah, you can probably still see me.

65
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,410
Okay guys, we're running really out of time,

66
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:46,460
so I'm gonna go hide here

67
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,740
'cause it looks super promising.

68
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,820
Oh, okay I think I can fit in it.

69
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:50,653
Bye guys.

70
00:01:50,653 --> 00:01:52,456
Don't tell Collins, I'm gonna win this.

71
00:01:52,456 --> 00:01:53,400
- Oh, this is the place.

72
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,740
Squeeze in back here.

73
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,580
Okay guys, this could actually work.

74
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,220
- I wish I could hide in one of these things.

75
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,110
That would be awesome,

76
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:01,200
that would be some like James Bond level stuff.

77
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,320
I might, do i able to like hide in here,

78
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,710
if you kinda like knot up

79
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,510
and become curled up into a ball or something?

80
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,260
- [Collins] Oh, I forgot to mention that all the zombies

81
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,190
are wearing ear plugs,

82
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,660
which means meaning they will not be able to hear us

83
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,674
and can only find us based on sight.

84
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:13,660
- I'm running out of time.

85
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,151
I have no clue where I'm gonna hide.

86
00:02:15,151 --> 00:02:20,151
(bell rings) (zombies grunt)

87
00:02:20,836 --> 00:02:22,349
- [Ben] Guys, they're coming, they're coming.

88
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:24,145
- I feel like you don't have as much adrenaline as me.

89
00:02:24,145 --> 00:02:24,978
What's in here? - [Nina] I do,

90
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:28,112
trust me, I do.

91
00:02:28,112 --> 00:02:30,121
(both screams)

92
00:02:30,121 --> 00:02:32,204
(grunts)

93
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,357
- Oh, check this.

94
00:02:35,357 --> 00:02:38,250
You can see everything that everybody else is doing.

95
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,280
Oh geeze, there are so many zombies.

96
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,733
I think I'm just gonna stay up here and hide.

97
00:02:41,733 --> 00:02:44,900
- Alright guys, so I found the perfect hiding spot.

98
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:45,850
It's around this corner.

99
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,020
There's no way that the zombies

100
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,300
are gonna be able to find me.

101
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,524
Alright guys, I'm gonna hop in, come on.

102
00:02:50,524 --> 00:02:54,051
Okay. (screams) (zombie grunts)

103
00:02:54,051 --> 00:02:57,218
- Shh! (zombie grunts)

104
00:02:58,697 --> 00:02:59,680
- Yo, come on in here and check this out.

105
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,070
We have like a control room.

106
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,850
Dude, I'm like so scared

107
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:03,820
a zombie is down this hallway over here.

108
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,731
But this is a great spot.

109
00:03:05,731 --> 00:03:08,687
(zombie grunts)

110
00:03:08,687 --> 00:03:10,410
- You need to use your brain now because I...

111
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:11,780
- We have the same brain! - I have tried everything.

112
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:12,691
Wait that's scary.

113
00:03:12,691 --> 00:03:13,524
- [Lindsay] Woodshop?

114
00:03:13,524 --> 00:03:14,700
- I don't like it in here.

115
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,960
- No one's ever gonna find me in here.

116
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,793
- [Nina] Can I fit?

117
00:03:16,793 --> 00:03:18,230
- I think there's room for both of us.

118
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:20,090
- [Devan] Dude, there are so many zombies.

119
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:21,560
I am so glad I'm up...

120
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,100
No, that's the siren (siren blaring)

121
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,934
and it means I have to change my hiding spot.

122
00:03:24,934 --> 00:03:27,851
(zombies grunting)

123
00:03:28,838 --> 00:03:29,671
- Alright.

124
00:03:33,261 --> 00:03:34,094
- [Collins] Okay everyone, listen up,

125
00:03:34,094 --> 00:03:35,600
zombies are coming but I found a hiding spot.

126
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,040
We would go down that way right now.

127
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,186
Let's go, let's go, let's go, go go go!

128
00:03:39,186 --> 00:03:40,019
Come on!

129
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:43,197
- Alright, alright, lets go, quickly.

130
00:03:43,197 --> 00:03:48,197
(group chattering) (zombies grunting)

131
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,575
Close the door,

132
00:03:49,575 --> 00:03:50,930
close the door.

133
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:51,819
Alright, let's turn on the lights

134
00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:52,652
and see what's going on here.

135
00:03:52,652 --> 00:03:53,485
Is the switch over here?

136
00:03:53,485 --> 00:03:54,318
- [Ben] Yeah, that's...

137
00:03:55,231 --> 00:03:56,250
(group exclaims)

138
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,083
- Alright guys, so here's the thing.

139
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:58,170
This is a great hiding spot

140
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,380
but the only issue with it is that

141
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,700
once the siren goes off, we're gonna all have to relocate

142
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,533
and find another hiding spot.

143
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,280
So how about this, we'll create some defense weapons

144
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,620
that way the zombies cannot tag us,

145
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,510
we'll be able to get away.

146
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:07,990
- I think I found a really good thing

147
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,380
out in the kitchen area.

148
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,620
So I'm actually going to go out there-

149
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,840
- You're going to go into the kitchen out there?

150
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,873
- I'm gonna try to find it. - Are you crazy?

151
00:04:12,873 --> 00:04:14,090
- I'll be back guys.

152
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:14,923
- Devan. - I'll be back.

153
00:04:14,923 --> 00:04:16,620
- And if you see Alexis out there, let us know

154
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,070
'cause we need to know if she's a zombie or not.

155
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,070
- I will definitely let you know.

156
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,360
All right, see you guys later.

157
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,120
- All right, so the goal is to find a weapon

158
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,357
and I think I found one over here.

159
00:04:23,357 --> 00:04:25,520
Just have to check for zombies.

160
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,910
Okay we're clear.

161
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:29,660
(metal clanging)

162
00:04:32,568 --> 00:04:33,526
- Okay so here's the thing guys

163
00:04:33,526 --> 00:04:34,401
I'm gonna try and make like an ax.

164
00:04:34,401 --> 00:04:36,350
- What if we liked taped it?

165
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,672
You should do that 'cause I don't know how.

166
00:04:37,672 --> 00:04:39,038
- Oh, guys I found it.

167
00:04:39,038 --> 00:04:40,420
Oh!

168
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,127
- Oh wait, Ben what are you doing over there dude?

169
00:04:42,127 --> 00:04:44,180
- [Collins] Put that down, dude put that down.

170
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,215
Alright let's test that thing out.

171
00:04:45,215 --> 00:04:46,048
- I really want to try this.

172
00:04:46,048 --> 00:04:47,820
- Get an arrow over here dude, I'm super excited.

173
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,780
- All right, I got it, What am I aiming for?

174
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:49,720
- [Collins] You're gonna aim for that can

175
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,553
that I set up for you.

176
00:04:50,553 --> 00:04:52,400
Alright here we go, three, two, one.

177
00:04:53,347 --> 00:04:55,567
(group exclaims)

178
00:04:55,567 --> 00:04:58,234
(zombie grunts)

179
00:05:02,986 --> 00:05:05,653
(zombie grunts)

180
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,440
- Here we go, we're gonna use this

181
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,235
to see if we can line this up properly.

182
00:05:14,235 --> 00:05:15,229
- That can work.

183
00:05:15,229 --> 00:05:17,312
- That's what I'm saying.

184
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,381
Oh it's upside down.

185
00:05:19,381 --> 00:05:21,070
- Alright guys, so far I gotta "p."

186
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,990
- Dude find a corner or something, like not just here.

187
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,730
- No, no, I got the letter "p," the big "p."

188
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:28,105
- That's not a "p' dude clearly it's a nine.

189
00:05:28,105 --> 00:05:29,404
- It's a six

190
00:05:29,404 --> 00:05:30,297
- Oh it's a 6?

191
00:05:30,297 --> 00:05:31,297
Quick Maths.

192
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,650
- Let's see if this can crush some zombies.

193
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:49,071
Safety goggles on; do not try this at home.`

194
00:05:49,071 --> 00:05:51,638
Alright here we go, three, two, one.

195
00:05:51,638 --> 00:05:52,747
(Collins exclaims)

196
00:05:52,747 --> 00:05:53,970
(zombies grunt)

197
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:57,490
- Oh, dude I think I found a room, I think I found a room.

198
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,539
Alright come on, come on, come on.

199
00:05:58,539 --> 00:05:59,372
What?

200
00:05:59,372 --> 00:06:00,205
No way!

201
00:06:00,205 --> 00:06:01,500
But before I show you want I found,

202
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,390
we have a huge announcement for you,

203
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:06,620
because on our last video we got over 40,000 comments

204
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,970
saying that you would be super hyped

205
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:09,880
to play a challenge created by Collins and me,

206
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,860
so guess what?

207
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,170
We took the best parts of your favorite videos

208
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:15,070
and turned them into our first ever line up

209
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:17,810
of challenges, toys and games you can play at home.

210
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,210
Comment down below "I'm in"

211
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,740

212
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:23,170
It's here dude, look at this thing.

213
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:24,430
Holy Cow!

214
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,380
I just gotta grab this, take this back to the group

215
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:29,241
and this is gonna be way better than anything they have got.

216
00:06:29,241 --> 00:06:30,077
(zombies grunt) Oh no no no!

217
00:06:30,077 --> 00:06:32,988
- So I have my PI paid "p" shooter.

218
00:06:32,988 --> 00:06:35,000
- (laughs) That guy has the most lethal

219
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,527
p I've ever seen in my life.

220
00:06:36,527 --> 00:06:38,230
(all laughs)

221
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,960
- Nina and Lindsay, what is this?

222
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:42,828
Shh, I think I hear a zombie.

223
00:06:42,828 --> 00:06:43,661
Hold on.

224
00:06:43,661 --> 00:06:45,077
Go back there and hide.

225
00:06:45,077 --> 00:06:50,077
(tense music) (zombie grunts)

226
00:06:51,118 --> 00:06:52,806
(plank clanks) (group exclaims)

227
00:06:52,806 --> 00:06:55,710
(door bangs)

228
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:56,543
(door slams)

229
00:06:56,543 --> 00:06:58,743
- Dude, it is so crazy out there.

230
00:06:58,743 --> 00:06:59,590
- What is that?

231
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:02,315
- This is my trust friend I found on the way.

232
00:07:02,315 --> 00:07:03,660
All right, I haven't tried this thing yet,

233
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,493
so let's see how this works.

234
00:07:04,493 --> 00:07:06,370
- And do not try this at home.

235
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:07,203
- Do not.

236
00:07:07,203 --> 00:07:08,036
- Here we go, you ready?

237
00:07:08,036 --> 00:07:09,723
Three, two, one.

238
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:13,346
(group exclaims)

239
00:07:14,566 --> 00:07:15,983
- That's nothing compared to ours.

240
00:07:15,983 --> 00:07:17,066
- What?

241
00:07:17,066 --> 00:07:18,843
- [Devan] How did you guys make this?

242
00:07:18,843 --> 00:07:19,819
- Oh, it was easy.

243
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:21,490
- Are you guys gonna launch it like at the two big cans?

244
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:22,323
- [Nina] We will right there.

245
00:07:22,323 --> 00:07:23,350
- You have goggles on.

246
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,960
Do not try this at home.

247
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,793
You guys ready?

248
00:07:25,793 --> 00:07:28,157
Here we go, three, two, one.

249
00:07:28,157 --> 00:07:33,157
(cans clanging) (group exclaims)

250
00:07:34,372 --> 00:07:35,570
- [Collins] Oh, that's the siren.

251
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:38,048
Okay, we gotta find new hiding spots.

252
00:07:38,048 --> 00:07:39,348
Get caught and you turn into a zombie

253
00:07:39,348 --> 00:07:40,181
but right now we gotta split up.

254
00:07:40,181 --> 00:07:42,255
- [Ben] We gotta go, go!

255
00:07:42,255 --> 00:07:45,422
- [Devan] Come on this way, follow me!

256
00:07:48,525 --> 00:07:49,358
- Ninja rolls at a time..

257
00:07:49,358 --> 00:07:50,683
- I'm not joking around.

258
00:07:56,093 --> 00:07:58,368
- Fudge, they're everywhere.

259
00:07:58,368 --> 00:08:00,535
(mumbles)

260
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:04,015
- This thing is way too loud.

261
00:08:04,015 --> 00:08:05,681
Okay, hold on I gotta to take this thing off.

262
00:08:05,681 --> 00:08:06,574
- [Bella] Okay.

263
00:08:06,574 --> 00:08:07,407
- [Devan] We're good?

264
00:08:07,407 --> 00:08:08,876
- [Bella] Yeah, okay so this says break room.

265
00:08:08,876 --> 00:08:09,709
Should we go through it?

266
00:08:09,709 --> 00:08:11,010
- I mean yeah, it might be a good spot.

267
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:11,885
Let's do it, let's do it.

268
00:08:11,885 --> 00:08:13,233
(zombie grants)

269
00:08:13,233 --> 00:08:14,463
Dude, oh god.

270
00:08:14,463 --> 00:08:16,963
(tense music)

271
00:08:18,212 --> 00:08:19,545
My phone's down.

272
00:08:21,263 --> 00:08:22,963
- Oh (indistinct), oh, this is it.

273
00:08:24,074 --> 00:08:24,941
(tense trombone)

274
00:08:24,941 --> 00:08:25,774
Oh, no!

275
00:08:25,774 --> 00:08:28,671
(artifacts crashing)

276
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,918
- Sorry, sorry.

277
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:31,033
- That was all your fault.

278
00:08:31,033 --> 00:08:33,991
- I know, come here. (zombie grunts)

279
00:08:33,991 --> 00:08:35,574
This way, this way.

280
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,430
- Wait, I here someone...

281
00:08:40,285 --> 00:08:43,202
(zombie shuffling)

282
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:54,086
- Okay go go go, come on, come on, come on.

283
00:08:54,086 --> 00:08:56,470
(Ben screaming)

284
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,524
- Where you going?

285
00:08:57,524 --> 00:08:58,366
Where we going?

286
00:08:58,366 --> 00:08:59,205
Alright I have enough

287
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,367

288
00:09:00,367 --> 00:09:01,740

289
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,900

290

00:09:10,943 --> 00:09:15,943
Dude, you alright? (screams)

294
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,817
Yo dude, I think we gotta make a run for it

295
00:09:18,817 --> 00:09:19,825
like over that way, okay?

296
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:21,765
Let's just go go go go go.

297
00:09:21,765 --> 00:09:25,029
(zombie grunt)

298
00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:27,529
(tense music)

299
00:09:42,065 --> 00:09:44,815
(dramatic music)

300
00:09:45,739 --> 00:09:47,830
- I can't take two at a time, Devan!

301
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:50,070
- [Lindsay] Whoa, this is insane, we found a spot.

302
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,110
- [Nina] It's cold in here, okay.

303
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,640
- [Lindsay] Wait what about in here?

304
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,473
This aint gonna work-

305
00:09:53,473 --> 00:09:54,739
- [Nina] I don't think I'll fit in there, what's in there?

306
00:09:54,739 --> 00:09:56,159
- Wait I think I have found something in here.

307
00:09:56,159 --> 00:10:01,159
(scream) (zombies grunting)

308
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,571
- Is this a secret door or something?

309
00:10:17,571 --> 00:10:19,088
Wait.

310
00:10:19,088 --> 00:10:20,652
Perfect.

311
00:10:20,652 --> 00:10:21,485
- Ooh.

312
00:10:22,757 --> 00:10:24,413
I think there's something over there.

313
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:29,318
Don't look this way, don't look this way.

314
00:10:29,318 --> 00:10:30,710
- [Ben] Is that a wheel?

315
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:33,023
Yeah, it's a wheel, go get it.

316
00:10:33,023 --> 00:10:34,170
- Hold this, hold this for a second.

317
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:35,003
- Be careful.

318
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:39,140
- Dude we can sneak behind this way.

319
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,503
Crouch crouch crouch down.

320
00:10:41,463 --> 00:10:42,296
On the count of three you go.

321
00:10:42,296 --> 00:10:45,213
Three, two, one, let's go go go go.

322
00:10:51,876 --> 00:10:52,709
Okay Okay.

323
00:10:53,835 --> 00:10:54,986
- I hear them everywhere.

324
00:10:54,986 --> 00:10:56,986
Let's just try it, okay.

325
00:10:59,546 --> 00:11:01,541
- [Bella] Where are we going?

326
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:02,374
Where?

327
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:06,155
(zombies grunting)

328
00:11:06,155 --> 00:11:07,952
(tense music)

329
00:11:07,952 --> 00:11:09,099
- Okay, okay!

330
00:11:09,099 --> 00:11:13,452
Come on, here we go (indistinct).

331
00:11:13,452 --> 00:11:16,302
- Oh my God! (laughs)

332
00:11:16,302 --> 00:11:17,676
(both mumbling)

333
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:18,509
- Wait a second.

334
00:11:18,509 --> 00:11:20,670
Look at this, we're gonna hide in plain sight.

335
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,370
You ready? (screams)

336
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:24,880
- It looks safe up there, I can see the sky.

337
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,470
They will probably never find me up here.

338
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:28,193
This is the best spot ever. (screams)

339
00:11:28,193 --> 00:11:30,393
- We gotta find a spot dude, we're running out of time.

340
00:11:30,393 --> 00:11:33,335
Do a little duck walk over here.

341
00:11:33,335 --> 00:11:35,752
A little duck-walk over here.

342
00:11:36,876 --> 00:11:37,709
Slick.

343
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:41,452
Behind us. (zombies grunting)

344
00:11:41,452 --> 00:11:43,050
- I'm not thin enough for this.

345
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,717
I'm not thin enough.

346
00:11:51,758 --> 00:11:54,073
(suspenseful music)

347
00:11:54,073 --> 00:11:55,559
- Bro they are so close right now.

348
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:57,226
- Did you hear them?

349
00:12:00,572 --> 00:12:02,071
- That was so close.

350
00:12:02,071 --> 00:12:03,731
- You're gonna crawl underneath?

351
00:12:03,731 --> 00:12:05,393
- Can't fit.

352
00:12:05,393 --> 00:12:06,610
There's a door.

353
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:08,810
- Dude no way, check it out.

354
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:09,643
Dude yo!

355
00:12:09,643 --> 00:12:10,820
Dude that's perfect.

356
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:11,653
Go go go go.

357
00:12:13,184 --> 00:12:15,392
(Ben screams)

358
00:12:15,392 --> 00:12:17,259
(siren ringing)

359
00:12:17,259 --> 00:12:18,520
- Wait no, that siren means

360
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,690
we have to find a new hiding spot.

361
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:22,477
Okay, run run run run run.

362
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,828
- I'm just gonna find a new hiding spot, I think...

363
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:28,036
(bricks crashing)

364
00:12:28,036 --> 00:12:28,869
Aaugh!

365
00:12:28,869 --> 00:12:31,286
(indistinct)

366
00:12:33,515 --> 00:12:34,660
- Okay, we are clear. - [Bella] Go go go go go go.

367
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,090
- We still haven't found a spot yet

368
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:38,013
so I'm thinking the kitchen might be a good place to be.

369
00:12:38,013 --> 00:12:40,897
- Okay, that would be good. - Go go go go go go!

370
00:12:40,897 --> 00:12:43,623
- (Collins screams) Wait a minute!

371
00:12:43,623 --> 00:12:45,220
- Wait a second, wait a second.

372
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,320
Keep your distance.

373
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,575
Are you a zombie? - [Bella] Don't get near us.

374
00:12:47,575 --> 00:12:49,830
- [Collins] Do I look like, do I look like a zombie?

375
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:50,980
- Yeah you're really pale right now.

376
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,530
- [Collins] I don't get a lot of sun.

377
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:53,770
I make YouTube videos all the time.

378
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:55,010
- Okay, all right.

379
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:55,843
The real question though is,

380
00:12:55,843 --> 00:12:57,696
are we the final three at this point?

381
00:12:57,696 --> 00:13:00,279
(zombie grunt)

382
00:13:19,026 --> 00:13:20,990
Okay, they are leaving.

383
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:22,330
- Okay well I guess that answers that.

384
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:23,370
The twins have been turned into zombies.

385
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,354
I know Ben was for sure turned into a zombie.

386
00:13:25,354 --> 00:13:26,250
I don't know about Alexis,

387
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,170
like she's been hiding this whole game or she's a zombie,

388
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:30,170
so I think, we might be the final three.

389
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:32,510
- [Devan] There's probably other zombies in here.

390
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,251
- I don't hear anything.

391
00:13:34,251 --> 00:13:35,084
- What is this?

392
00:13:35,084 --> 00:13:38,240
(group exclaims)

393
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,643
- Why is this here? - Why is it not?

394
00:13:39,643 --> 00:13:41,893
This place has got literally everything bro.

395
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,860
This is the answer.

396
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:44,693
Today's game plan

397
00:13:44,693 --> 00:13:45,697
is that we're trying to find the place to hide

398
00:13:45,697 --> 00:13:48,880
in plain sight and make ourselves look like zombies.

399
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,800
- What, I like it!

400
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:54,415
- Dude, that is absolutely insane, I am not sticking around.

401
00:13:54,415 --> 00:13:55,760
- Go go go go!

402
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,420
I'm out, I'm out people.

403
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,830
- You gotta tell us how to make us over.

404
00:13:58,830 --> 00:13:59,702
What is he thinking?

405
00:13:59,702 --> 00:14:01,020
There's a lot of zombies here, so how about this?

406
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,730
We gotta make one more item we can use

407
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:03,650
'cause now we're a team.

408
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:05,020
New team alert, let's get it.

409
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,148
Alright, check the freezer.

410
00:14:07,148 --> 00:14:08,380
Yo, look at this.

411
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,610
There's like a hand in here.

412
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:10,727
We can probably make a candy arm out of this.

413
00:14:10,727 --> 00:14:12,370
We got the head, the candy arm.

414
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:13,796
There's like doughnuts over here

415
00:14:13,796 --> 00:14:15,943
that we can use to build the arm.

416
00:14:15,943 --> 00:14:18,943
(zombies shuffling)

417
00:14:26,489 --> 00:14:27,430
- We'll grab some doughnuts.

418
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:29,679
- So I still haven't found a spot but gonna try it out.

419
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:31,795
Okay coast is clear.

420
00:14:31,795 --> 00:14:33,665
Dude, they are so many zombies out here.

421
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:37,024
Holy cow, I'm gonna try to go here.

422
00:14:37,024 --> 00:14:39,337
- We gotta do this fast, they're gonna find us here.

423
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:40,170
- I need to break this.

424
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,003
- You need to break this, leave that to me.

425
00:14:41,003 --> 00:14:42,311
Here we go.

426
00:14:42,311 --> 00:14:43,144
(plastic crashes)

427
00:14:43,144 --> 00:14:43,977
Oh!

428
00:14:43,977 --> 00:14:45,538
- Shh.

429
00:14:45,538 --> 00:14:47,517
- I don't know, it's resistant to drop kicking.

430
00:14:47,517 --> 00:14:50,013
That was strong man, holy cow.

431
00:14:50,013 --> 00:14:51,840
Oh it's like an elbow for the arm?

432
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,967
There we go by the way.

433
00:14:52,967 --> 00:14:54,651
No no no, that's a twig.

434
00:14:54,651 --> 00:14:57,793
- Oh, I thought it was pretty similar.

435
00:14:57,793 --> 00:15:00,043
(exclaims)

436
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,940
- Oh wait a second.

437
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,450
I think there was something over here.

438
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:09,810
I just found the best spot ever.

439
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:11,810
Dude, no one's gonna find me here.

440
00:15:12,882 --> 00:15:13,953
(screams)

441
00:15:13,953 --> 00:15:16,379
- Okay so here we go, we got the glaze over here.

442
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:17,461
No,

443
00:15:17,461 --> 00:15:18,294
oh no!

444
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:20,152
We are so close!

445
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:21,123
Okay, we gotta manage to look like zombies

446
00:15:21,123 --> 00:15:23,253
like real quick like right now.

447
00:15:23,253 --> 00:15:24,200
Just pop it on your face?

448
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,323
No way.

449
00:15:26,555 --> 00:15:27,388
- Do more. - All right.

450
00:15:27,388 --> 00:15:28,221
Okay ready?

451
00:15:28,221 --> 00:15:29,919
- Three, two, one.

452
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:32,950
(Collins laughs)

453
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:33,990
- That's gonna be a meme.

454
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:34,926
Are you good, is that enough?

455
00:15:34,926 --> 00:15:35,759
- I gotta do it to you.

456
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,123
I don't know, three, two, one.

457
00:15:38,123 --> 00:15:40,623
(lady laughs)

458
00:15:41,735 --> 00:15:42,568
- Okay, we need to get going.

459
00:15:42,568 --> 00:15:45,276
(indistinct)

460
00:15:45,276 --> 00:15:47,450
- Why is it acting all like rubbery?

461
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:51,850
Dude they are all out there.

462
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,374
We're gonna be like full on zombies.

463
00:15:53,374 --> 00:15:54,207
- Okay.

464
00:15:54,207 --> 00:15:55,040
