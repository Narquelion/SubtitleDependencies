1
00:00:00,267 --> 00:00:02,244
- Yo I can't believe it worked.

2
00:00:02,244 --> 00:00:04,840
You challenged me to make DIY gummy fidget spinners.

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,427
One of them's going to be a normal sized fidget spinner,

4
00:00:06,427 --> 00:00:07,887
like ow, like this.

5
00:00:07,887 --> 00:00:10,440
Another one's going to be a medium sized fidget spinner

6
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,859
and the last one is going to be the world's largest

7
00:00:12,859 --> 00:00:13,890
gummy fidget spinner.

8
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,329
But right now let's have some fun and do

9
00:00:15,329 --> 00:00:17,095
some fidget spinner tricks.

10
00:00:17,095 --> 00:00:18,989
(upbeat rock music)

11
00:00:18,989 --> 00:00:19,822
Let's go.

12
00:00:19,822 --> 00:00:22,989
â™« Three, two, one, go

13
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,470
â™« Go

14
00:00:32,847 --> 00:00:33,959
(crashing)

15
00:00:33,959 --> 00:00:35,635
Yeah so now that I've officially mastered

16
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:37,801
the fidget spinner tricks it's time to move on to making

17
00:00:37,801 --> 00:00:40,228
the first gummy fidget spinner.

18
00:00:40,228 --> 00:00:42,395
It's actually really easy to make gummy fidget spinners.

19
00:00:42,395 --> 00:00:43,761
All you need are a few things.

20
00:00:43,761 --> 00:00:45,029
You need some boiling water,

21
00:00:45,029 --> 00:00:46,852
which you are going to add into a bowl.

22
00:00:46,852 --> 00:00:48,552
You're also going to need some gelatin.

23
00:00:48,552 --> 00:00:50,840
You are then going to add that into a bowl.

24
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,571
(sniffing)

25
00:00:52,571 --> 00:00:53,404
(coughing)

26
00:00:53,404 --> 00:00:54,434
You're actually going to take a whisk

27
00:00:54,434 --> 00:00:56,159
and you're just going to want to whisk it in there

28
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:57,144
and mix it all together.

29
00:00:57,144 --> 00:00:57,977
Uh oh.

30
00:00:57,977 --> 00:00:59,286
Okay you've got to do it quick 'cause otherwise

31
00:00:59,286 --> 00:01:00,119
it's going to get all messed up.

32
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:01,452
Whip it to the sauce boy.

33
00:01:01,452 --> 00:01:03,253
Now that we have the water and the gelatin mixed up,

34
00:01:03,253 --> 00:01:04,945
it's time to add the food coloring.

35
00:01:04,945 --> 00:01:07,317
And the Instagram Keyper of the Week suggested we add blue

36
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,634
and if you want to be shouted out as the Instagram

37
00:01:09,634 --> 00:01:11,545
Keyper of the Week check the description down below

38
00:01:11,545 --> 00:01:12,443
to find out how.

39
00:01:12,443 --> 00:01:13,772
Now we're only going to use two drops of this

40
00:01:13,772 --> 00:01:14,605
so here we go.

41
00:01:14,605 --> 00:01:15,617
We're going to do it from a high distance

42
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:16,450
because I'm feeling very dangerous.

43
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:17,819
He's lined up.

44
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:19,736
The tension's building.

45
00:01:20,796 --> 00:01:21,629
(dripping)

46
00:01:21,629 --> 00:01:22,606
Oh kind of missed it.

47
00:01:22,606 --> 00:01:24,581
Drop number two I gotta make this one more successful

48
00:01:24,581 --> 00:01:25,990
so we'll start off in the bowl and we'll do

49
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:27,968
a direct lift strategy.

50
00:01:27,968 --> 00:01:29,079
I'm going from even higher this time

51
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:30,142
because I feel super dangerous.

52
00:01:30,142 --> 00:01:32,063
I really hope my calculations are correct.

53
00:01:32,063 --> 00:01:32,896
(dripping)

54
00:01:32,896 --> 00:01:33,950
Yay a direct hit!

55
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:36,925
Okay now it's time to mix it up.

56
00:01:36,925 --> 00:01:38,283
Whoa!

57
00:01:38,283 --> 00:01:40,439
That got blue very quickly.

58
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:41,936
It took like a whisk and a half to get very blue.

59
00:01:41,936 --> 00:01:43,470
Now we have the gelatin, the water, it smells terrible,

60
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,815
we have the food coloring in and it's time

61
00:01:44,815 --> 00:01:46,553
to pour it into the mold.

62
00:01:46,553 --> 00:01:47,837
And this right here is the mold.

63
00:01:47,837 --> 00:01:49,060
If you want to know how to make this just check out

64
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,195
the video I did on candy fidget spinners.

65
00:01:51,195 --> 00:01:53,029
We're just going to dump this in so,

66
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:54,256
this looks really weird.

67
00:01:54,256 --> 00:01:56,123
It's kind of like gushy if that's even a word.

68
00:01:56,123 --> 00:01:57,470
Okay I think I need to stop there.

69
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:58,453
Oh it's over spilling.

70
00:01:58,453 --> 00:02:00,574
(shrieking)

71
00:02:00,574 --> 00:02:01,930
Now we're going to be putting it in the fridge

72
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,844
and we're going to see whether or not we can actually

73
00:02:03,844 --> 00:02:05,496
make the gummy fidget spinner spin,

74
00:02:05,496 --> 00:02:06,523
that's a lot of spins,

75
00:02:06,523 --> 00:02:09,822
but let's spin into the next part.

76
00:02:09,822 --> 00:02:10,655
(slamming)

77
00:02:10,655 --> 00:02:12,172
Oh geez alright guys well now it's ready.

78
00:02:12,172 --> 00:02:13,436
That probably didn't work because you can like

79
00:02:13,436 --> 00:02:15,257
see my hand drop it.

80
00:02:15,257 --> 00:02:17,734
And now time to see if it worked or not.

81
00:02:17,734 --> 00:02:19,691
Let's see if we can pop it out of the mold.

82
00:02:19,691 --> 00:02:22,358
Well it's definitely very gummy.

83
00:02:24,266 --> 00:02:26,562
Fam, this is looking real floppy.

84
00:02:26,562 --> 00:02:27,395
It's all wet too.

85
00:02:27,395 --> 00:02:29,354
Oh gosh I need to kind of like dry it out a little bit.

86
00:02:29,354 --> 00:02:30,593
(breath blowing)

87
00:02:30,593 --> 00:02:32,829
Gonna flip it over, kind of like roast it on both sides.

88
00:02:32,829 --> 00:02:33,972
Boom, roasted.

89
00:02:33,972 --> 00:02:35,350
So now we need to add the center

90
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:36,638
of the fidget spinner to it.

91
00:02:36,638 --> 00:02:37,765
So to do that you have to take

92
00:02:37,765 --> 00:02:38,953
one of your original fidget spinners.

93
00:02:38,953 --> 00:02:40,861
You pop out one of these things.

94
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:44,611
And then (imitates pinging).

95
00:02:46,845 --> 00:02:47,678
Tutorial.

96
00:02:47,678 --> 00:02:49,690
And then we're going to put this in here.

97
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:50,600
Now it's time to find out

98
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,209
can we make the gummy fidget spinner spin.

99
00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:54,270
But first I have a challenge.

100
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,294
I want to see if you can subscribe to this channel,

101
00:02:56,294 --> 00:02:58,390
turn on the channel post notifications

102
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:01,026
and give this video a thumbs up in seven seconds.

103
00:03:01,026 --> 00:03:01,859
Can you do it?

104
00:03:01,859 --> 00:03:02,951
Here we go.

105
00:03:02,951 --> 00:03:07,115
Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.

106
00:03:07,115 --> 00:03:08,956
(laughing)

107
00:03:08,956 --> 00:03:09,789
Done.

108
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:12,673
If you can do that comment Keyper Squad right now.

109
00:03:12,673 --> 00:03:15,223
Let's forget about whatever that was

110
00:03:15,223 --> 00:03:17,188
and let's try to make this spin.

111
00:03:17,188 --> 00:03:18,854
Well the camera stopped rolling for like one second

112
00:03:18,854 --> 00:03:19,850
and then this happened.

113
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:20,889
So I don't know how I'm going

114
00:03:20,889 --> 00:03:21,870
to recover this off of the table.

115
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:22,832
Help, please don't break.

116
00:03:22,832 --> 00:03:24,209
It's so close fam.

117
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:25,578
It's starting to split.

118
00:03:25,578 --> 00:03:26,411
What happened?

119
00:03:26,411 --> 00:03:27,970
Gummy fidget, no!

120
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,837
(crying)

121
00:03:29,837 --> 00:03:31,686
You had so much potential.

122
00:03:31,686 --> 00:03:33,260
Alright well, no way we can make it spin

123
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,407
but I do have a solution,

124
00:03:34,407 --> 00:03:35,854
an innovation I think could make this work.

125
00:03:35,854 --> 00:03:39,437
Oh my heart, it breaks as my fidget breaks.

126
00:03:40,425 --> 00:03:41,380
Here's what I'm going to try to do.

127
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,339
I'm going to see if I can actually get this.

128
00:03:43,339 --> 00:03:46,597
I'm going to get one side over here, sheboimps,

129
00:03:46,597 --> 00:03:49,252
get one side over here, sheboimps,

130
00:03:49,252 --> 00:03:51,912
and then whatever's left of this side over here, sheboimps.

131
00:03:51,912 --> 00:03:52,745
Oh no, hmm.

132
00:03:52,745 --> 00:03:54,314
See how it's kind of on there because there's no way

133
00:03:54,314 --> 00:03:55,147
it's going to spin on its own.

134
00:03:55,147 --> 00:03:56,190
Let's see if I can get this to spin.

135
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,023
The moment of truth.

136
00:03:57,023 --> 00:03:58,436
Here we go, three, two, one.

137
00:03:58,436 --> 00:03:59,769
Oh no my fidget.

138
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:01,944
(crashing)

139
00:04:01,944 --> 00:04:04,738
Well I think now we move on to the medium one.

140
00:04:04,738 --> 00:04:05,581
I look at it this way.

141
00:04:05,581 --> 00:04:06,852
We're learning from the mistakes.

142
00:04:06,852 --> 00:04:10,109
This did not work at all but moving on to the next one

143
00:04:10,109 --> 00:04:11,663
I think I'm going to add a lot more gelatin

144
00:04:11,663 --> 00:04:13,821
and so this medium sized one I have a really good feeling

145
00:04:13,821 --> 00:04:14,666
it's going to work.

146
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:17,406
But at least I get to try it, though.

147
00:04:17,406 --> 00:04:19,609
(gagging)

148
00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:21,369
(coughing)

149
00:04:21,369 --> 00:04:23,708
Oh man, it's like straight gelatin and water.

150
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:24,565
It's like an aftertaste.

151
00:04:24,565 --> 00:04:27,762
Alright for the medium one, to make sure it's a success

152
00:04:27,762 --> 00:04:29,942
I'm adding 20 packets

153
00:04:29,942 --> 00:04:31,213
into this container.

154
00:04:31,213 --> 00:04:32,369
And check out this trick I learned.

155
00:04:32,369 --> 00:04:33,484
Are you ready for this?

156
00:04:33,484 --> 00:04:35,125
(pan clattering)

157
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:36,730
Alright this water is very, very, very hot

158
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,435
and just like the little version of this

159
00:04:38,435 --> 00:04:40,518
there's a lot of steam.

160
00:04:40,518 --> 00:04:42,375
We are going to be adding a whole bunch of hot water

161
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:45,675
into this pan, so let's hope this goes well.

162
00:04:45,675 --> 00:04:46,607
Oh boy.

163
00:04:46,607 --> 00:04:47,843
Yay we're doing good.

164
00:04:47,843 --> 00:04:49,926
This is so far a success.

165
00:04:51,318 --> 00:04:54,083
This is very hot, like I can feel the heat coming off of it

166
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:57,021
and I think we're good right there.

167
00:04:57,021 --> 00:04:58,484
Alright, I didn't burn myself.

168
00:04:58,484 --> 00:05:00,234
Mission accomplished.

169
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,883
Now that we've added all the water it's time to add

170
00:05:03,883 --> 00:05:05,140
the gelatin packets.

171
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,389
Now I've opened them up as you can see.

172
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:07,572
I want to keep them as far away from me

173
00:05:07,572 --> 00:05:08,596
'cause they smell disgusting

174
00:05:08,596 --> 00:05:11,831
but this is 20 packets of gelatin all in one container.

175
00:05:11,831 --> 00:05:16,739
It's going to be so bad when I mix it with the hot water.

176
00:05:16,739 --> 00:05:18,517
Okay I'm going to be mixing it as it's going in.

177
00:05:18,517 --> 00:05:20,703
Oh no this is not working.

178
00:05:20,703 --> 00:05:21,536
It's clumping.

179
00:05:21,536 --> 00:05:24,589
(coughing)

180
00:05:24,589 --> 00:05:26,128
Oh it's spilling.

181
00:05:26,128 --> 00:05:28,344
Oh my gosh okay yah I definitely put way too much water.

182
00:05:28,344 --> 00:05:30,236
I'm going to go for this technique.

183
00:05:30,236 --> 00:05:31,933
Oh my gosh this is just a disaster.

184
00:05:31,933 --> 00:05:33,901
No it's so much gelatin.

185
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:35,642
Work with me fam I need to make this cool.

186
00:05:35,642 --> 00:05:37,424
This smells horrible, this looks horrible,

187
00:05:37,424 --> 00:05:40,332
and I did a horrible job at mixing it together

188
00:05:40,332 --> 00:05:42,781
so hopefully this turns out not horrible.

189
00:05:42,781 --> 00:05:44,402
And last but not least I can't forget

190
00:05:44,402 --> 00:05:45,503
to add the food coloring.

191
00:05:45,503 --> 00:05:47,515
It smells so disgusting right now

192
00:05:47,515 --> 00:05:49,929
but you guys all suggested pink for the medium sized one

193
00:05:49,929 --> 00:05:51,803
so we'll add this in here.

194
00:05:51,803 --> 00:05:52,925
I'm going to be a little bit more liberal with this,

195
00:05:52,925 --> 00:05:54,498
just kind of distribute it evenly.

196
00:05:54,498 --> 00:05:55,665
Just one, two.

197
00:05:56,706 --> 00:05:59,490
Yo this looks so crazy and like my eyes are really

198
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:02,197
enjoying the visuals of it but my nose is suffering

199
00:06:02,197 --> 00:06:03,183
so much right now.

200
00:06:03,183 --> 00:06:05,213
You guys have no idea how toxic

201
00:06:05,213 --> 00:06:08,478
and it just smells so, so bad.

202
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:10,655
So hopefully it looks good though in the end

203
00:06:10,655 --> 00:06:12,804
and let's pop it in the refrigerator.

204
00:06:12,804 --> 00:06:14,618
- [SpongeBob's Narrator] Two hours later.

205
00:06:14,618 --> 00:06:16,249
- Fidget spinner versus Jello.

206
00:06:16,249 --> 00:06:17,513
Three, two, one.

207
00:06:17,513 --> 00:06:18,779
(thud)

208
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:19,678
(crickets chirping)

209
00:06:19,678 --> 00:06:20,980
Yeah that's probably going to get cut.

210
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,418
That was really boring.

211
00:06:22,418 --> 00:06:23,648
And then I'm going to leave it in.

212
00:06:23,648 --> 00:06:27,411
The Jello is now ready and this is the most dangerous part

213
00:06:27,411 --> 00:06:29,678
of this entire video because I cut out right now

214
00:06:29,678 --> 00:06:32,036
a mold of the fidget spinner so we're going

215
00:06:32,036 --> 00:06:35,134
to place this down and then use an exacto knife to cut out

216
00:06:35,134 --> 00:06:36,342
the gummy into a fidget spinner.

217
00:06:36,342 --> 00:06:38,094
So if you do this at home, be very careful.

218
00:06:38,094 --> 00:06:39,350
Make sure you have parental supervision

219
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,384
with the knife.

220
00:06:40,384 --> 00:06:42,051
I was about to say cuts through like butter

221
00:06:42,051 --> 00:06:43,522
but it actually cuts through like Jello.

222
00:06:43,522 --> 00:06:44,355
(laughing)

223
00:06:44,355 --> 00:06:45,908
Almost there, we're coming around the back side now.

224
00:06:45,908 --> 00:06:47,910
Coming close to the beginning again.

225
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:48,743
Boom, done.

226
00:06:48,743 --> 00:06:50,009
(thud)

227
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:51,297
Ow almost broke my finger.

228
00:06:51,297 --> 00:06:52,334
Let's see if I can get this out.

229
00:06:52,334 --> 00:06:54,667
Here we go, three, two, one.

230
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,870
Yo this looks crazy.

231
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:59,773
(laughing)

232
00:06:59,773 --> 00:07:01,567
On the bottom of it it has the words

233
00:07:01,567 --> 00:07:03,485
from the bottom of the tin printed into it.

234
00:07:03,485 --> 00:07:05,560
Now it's time to cut out the hole in the middle

235
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,700
and this one looks like it has the potential

236
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,979
to be able to spin unlike the rest of them.

237
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:11,426
We're just going to have to eyeball it,

238
00:07:11,426 --> 00:07:13,356
going to have to go for it, just use my instincts.

239
00:07:13,356 --> 00:07:14,430
Channel my inner gummy.

240
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,552
Here we go, alright.

241
00:07:15,552 --> 00:07:18,762
(upbeat music)

242
00:07:18,762 --> 00:07:20,199
I'm feeling good, I'm getting good vibes.

243
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:21,426
Oops.

244
00:07:21,426 --> 00:07:24,369
(ominous music)

245
00:07:24,369 --> 00:07:25,202
Here we go.

246
00:07:25,202 --> 00:07:26,051
The moment of truth.

247
00:07:26,051 --> 00:07:26,884
Going to pop it out.

248
00:07:26,884 --> 00:07:27,962
Yay we did it! (cheering)

249
00:07:27,962 --> 00:07:29,762
There we go, it's a fidget spinner made out of gummy.

250
00:07:29,762 --> 00:07:31,486
Uh oh it's starting to crack so we're going to

251
00:07:31,486 --> 00:07:32,759
pop it on a fidget spinner just like this,

252
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:33,858
kind of position it properly.

253
00:07:33,858 --> 00:07:34,693
It's touching the ground.

254
00:07:34,693 --> 00:07:35,526
That's going to be very.

255
00:07:35,526 --> 00:07:36,359
(gasping)

256
00:07:36,359 --> 00:07:39,061
Sorry I just got very excited for a split second.

257
00:07:39,061 --> 00:07:40,271
This might work, it has potential.

258
00:07:40,271 --> 00:07:43,373
Here we go, three, two, one.

259
00:07:43,373 --> 00:07:44,846
Yo that's about as close as we're going to get.

260
00:07:44,846 --> 00:07:45,679
Now it's time to see--

261
00:07:45,679 --> 00:07:46,512
No!

262
00:07:46,512 --> 00:07:47,345
No!

263
00:07:47,345 --> 00:07:48,790
If we can get it to spin on its own.

264
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:49,949
It's not going to happen.

265
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:51,058
The big one has to work.

266
00:07:51,058 --> 00:07:53,430
That one cannot break at all but I'm going to try

267
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,338
a bit of this right now.

268
00:07:54,338 --> 00:07:55,392
I think it's going to taste disgusting

269
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:57,360
but it looks delicious, but the looks can be deceiving, so.

270
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,980
Look how disgusting this looks on the back.

271
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,313
Here we go, three, two, one.

272
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:06,250
(gagging)

273
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,807
Okay, we're good, we're back.

274
00:08:08,807 --> 00:08:09,640
Back in action.

275
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,241
This just tastes so disgusting because you've got to know

276
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,302
what's in Jello.

277
00:08:13,302 --> 00:08:16,416
Google it or don't, because you'll never eat Jello again.

278
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:17,821
We're moving on right now to the final one

279
00:08:17,821 --> 00:08:21,321
which is the massive gummy fidget spinner.

280
00:08:24,215 --> 00:08:25,048
(crashing)

281
00:08:25,048 --> 00:08:25,881
Ow.

282
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:27,109
Instead of showing you the exact same process

283
00:08:27,109 --> 00:08:28,967
for the third time by filling it with hot water

284
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:31,215
and then gelatin, I thought let's just fast forward

285
00:08:31,215 --> 00:08:33,019
right now and then you guys wanted me to make

286
00:08:33,019 --> 00:08:35,048
a blue version, a pink version and green version

287
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:37,368
and we're going to be fitting these pieces

288
00:08:37,368 --> 00:08:39,730
into a massive gummy fidget spinner.

289
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:41,234
I've got a whole bunch of cutouts right here

290
00:08:41,234 --> 00:08:43,454
and right now I'm going to place a cutout on each one

291
00:08:43,454 --> 00:08:46,454
and then we are going to cut it out.

292
00:08:47,905 --> 00:08:50,187
- [SpongeBob Narrator] One eternity later.

293
00:08:50,187 --> 00:08:51,615
(laughing)

294
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:52,520
- This looks so funny.

295
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,591
It looks almost like a little hairy beard

296
00:08:54,591 --> 00:08:55,732
that I have around my face like hello.

297
00:08:55,732 --> 00:08:56,900
(screaming)

298
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,710
And there you have it guys, the final piece

299
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:00,739
of the gummy fidget spinner.

300
00:09:00,739 --> 00:09:02,413
And now it's time to put it all together.

301
00:09:02,413 --> 00:09:03,789
This next part is kind of like a puzzle

302
00:09:03,789 --> 00:09:05,522
because we're going to take each of these pieces

303
00:09:05,522 --> 00:09:07,597
and fit them together, see how they all go.

304
00:09:07,597 --> 00:09:10,924
Place a blue one here, oh I get it, I get it, I get it.

305
00:09:10,924 --> 00:09:13,403
It goes like this, yeah.

306
00:09:13,403 --> 00:09:15,983
It goes like that and with the, aha, yup, yup,

307
00:09:15,983 --> 00:09:18,406
the blue one here, yeah.

308
00:09:18,406 --> 00:09:21,047
And then we do the pink one.

309
00:09:21,047 --> 00:09:21,880
Nope.

310
00:09:23,173 --> 00:09:24,628
What combination am I missing.

311
00:09:24,628 --> 00:09:26,139
There's literally three pieces.

312
00:09:26,139 --> 00:09:27,805
It's been brought to my attention that I had it

313
00:09:27,805 --> 00:09:29,260
flipped the wrong way.

314
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:32,300
So now let's try this, let's see.

315
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,700
(cheering)

316
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,993
This is now, guys, the largest gummy fidget spinner

317
00:09:37,993 --> 00:09:41,336
in the entire world and now the moment

318
00:09:41,336 --> 00:09:42,252
you've all been waiting for.

319
00:09:42,252 --> 00:09:45,668
Time to go outside and make it spin.

320
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:46,501
Let's go.

321
00:09:47,984 --> 00:09:49,965
Now because I couldn't find a giant version of

322
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:52,221
whatever it is that makes a fidget spinner spin,

323
00:09:52,221 --> 00:09:53,504
the thing in the middle, I don't know, it's like magic.

324
00:09:53,504 --> 00:09:54,337
I don't know how it all works.

325
00:09:54,337 --> 00:09:57,305
I had to get one of these here which is a giant

326
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,652
cake spinner and now I'm going to be putting

327
00:09:58,652 --> 00:09:59,641
the fidget spinner on this,

328
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:01,283
spinning it around and then I also have a giant

329
00:10:01,283 --> 00:10:02,475
cake mold over here.

330
00:10:02,475 --> 00:10:05,016
It looks like a ninja throwing star.

331
00:10:05,016 --> 00:10:06,012
(thudding)

332
00:10:06,012 --> 00:10:08,181
It's over there now but we're going to grab it in a second.

333
00:10:08,181 --> 00:10:09,584
I've now reacquired my ninja star.

334
00:10:09,584 --> 00:10:10,771
I got it from that way.

335
00:10:10,771 --> 00:10:12,069
No, no, no, no, no that way.

336
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,732
Okay let's do this.

337
00:10:13,732 --> 00:10:16,289
The ninja star goes on the spinner

338
00:10:16,289 --> 00:10:17,534
and now we're going to be grabbing the gummies.

339
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:19,922
So first we're going to grab the blue gummy.

340
00:10:19,922 --> 00:10:20,925
Have to remember how this goes.

341
00:10:20,925 --> 00:10:22,882
I think the blue gummy goes over here.

342
00:10:22,882 --> 00:10:25,435
(ominous music)

343
00:10:25,435 --> 00:10:28,321
Oh no, don't get grass on you my friend.

344
00:10:28,321 --> 00:10:30,241
Now we've got the red or pink gummy.

345
00:10:30,241 --> 00:10:31,646
I can't really figure out which one is which,

346
00:10:31,646 --> 00:10:32,837
and I'll pop that right there.

347
00:10:32,837 --> 00:10:35,795
And now we have the green gummy, the final piece.

348
00:10:35,795 --> 00:10:36,628
Here we go, guys.

349
00:10:36,628 --> 00:10:38,354
We're about to spin the world's largest

350
00:10:38,354 --> 00:10:40,128
gummy fidget spinner but first if you want to

351
00:10:40,128 --> 00:10:42,086
be featured in the next video, comment down below

352
00:10:42,086 --> 00:10:44,409
what should we make our next fidget spinner out of?

353
00:10:44,409 --> 00:10:46,373
But right now the moment of truth.

354
00:10:46,373 --> 00:10:47,333
Will it spin?

355
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:48,666
Three, two, one.

356
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:54,673
Alright now we've got to spin it up a little bit.

357
00:10:54,673 --> 00:10:55,947
No!

358
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:57,336
You know guys I'd say that worked

359
00:10:57,336 --> 00:10:58,169
and that's it.

360
00:10:58,169 --> 00:10:59,002
I love you all so much.

00:10:59,002 --> 00:11:01,137
This is like my tongue.

00:11:01,137 --> 00:11:01,970
Bye!
