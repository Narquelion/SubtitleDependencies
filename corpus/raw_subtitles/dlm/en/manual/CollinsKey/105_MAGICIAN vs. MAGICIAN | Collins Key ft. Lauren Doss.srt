1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:00,933
- What's up, guys?

2
00:00:00,933 --> 00:00:03,759
It's Collins Key, and welcome to the Thursday vlog.

3
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:05,733
Today I'm all the way out in St. Louis

4
00:00:05,733 --> 00:00:07,700
because I have a very special guest with me.

5
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,130
Joining in this chair of awesomeness,

6
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:11,525
everyone please welcome Lauren Doss.

7
00:00:11,525 --> 00:00:12,358
(snaps)

8
00:00:12,358 --> 00:00:13,870
- [Unison] Hey!

9
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:15,454
- Yay, welcome to one of my videos,

10
00:00:15,454 --> 00:00:16,555
it's officially happening.

11
00:00:16,555 --> 00:00:18,169
For today's video, we are going to do a

12
00:00:18,169 --> 00:00:20,169
Battle of the Magicians.

13
00:00:21,067 --> 00:00:22,043
For those of you guys who are wondering,

14
00:00:22,043 --> 00:00:23,628
what is going on right now?

15
00:00:23,628 --> 00:00:24,789
Lauren is actually the winner

16
00:00:24,789 --> 00:00:26,693
of the one lucky fan collab,

17
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,585
which I did at my last live performance.

18
00:00:28,585 --> 00:00:31,070
And basically, anyone who participated in the show

19
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,171
was entered into a chance to have me fly out to

20
00:00:33,171 --> 00:00:34,913
wherever they live, have dinner with them,

21
00:00:34,913 --> 00:00:35,917
shoot a collab video,

22
00:00:35,917 --> 00:00:38,587
and I found out today that Lauren is actually a magician.

23
00:00:38,587 --> 00:00:40,157
And if you want me to actually fly out to wherever

24
00:00:40,157 --> 00:00:41,536
you live and be able to shoot a collab with you,

25
00:00:41,536 --> 00:00:43,982
let me know by hitting the Like button down below.

26
00:00:43,982 --> 00:00:46,870
Without further ado, let's get to the battle.

27
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:48,969
And one more thing, I've been getting a ton of requests

28
00:00:48,969 --> 00:00:50,838
to do another Christmas fan mail blog.

29
00:00:50,838 --> 00:00:52,725
And so if you guys want to send me crazy wacky

30
00:00:52,725 --> 00:00:54,809
fun weird gifts, I'm going to put my PO Box

31
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:56,654
in the description down below.

32
00:00:56,654 --> 00:00:57,821
So be sure to send them in,

33
00:00:57,821 --> 00:00:59,203
let's get started with the video.

34
00:00:59,203 --> 00:01:00,700
Now for today's magic battle,

35
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,703
we've brought along a deck of Bicycle playing cards

36
00:01:02,703 --> 00:01:04,340
as our weapon of choice.

37
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,314
So I'm going to unsheath the cards.

38
00:01:06,314 --> 00:01:07,742
Extra sound effects.

39
00:01:07,742 --> 00:01:09,826
All the cards are different, and Lauren,

40
00:01:09,826 --> 00:01:11,080
I want you to touch any card you want.

41
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,518
Just touch it, let the magic begin.

42
00:01:13,518 --> 00:01:14,621
Right there, take it out.

43
00:01:14,621 --> 00:01:16,031
I want you to show it to the camera.

44
00:01:16,031 --> 00:01:17,529
Make sure everyone at home memorizes that card,

45
00:01:17,529 --> 00:01:18,707
it's very important, let's see,

46
00:01:18,707 --> 00:01:20,687
the queen of clubs.

47
00:01:20,687 --> 00:01:23,107
So I want you to watch really closely right here,

48
00:01:23,107 --> 00:01:24,849
check this out, watch the queen.

49
00:01:24,849 --> 00:01:26,556
In the middle, push it in.

50
00:01:26,556 --> 00:01:27,389
Lauren snap.

51
00:01:27,389 --> 00:01:28,222
(snaps)

52
00:01:28,222 --> 00:01:30,776
And actually the cut rises all the way through the rest,

53
00:01:30,776 --> 00:01:33,109
to the very top of the deck.

54
00:01:34,711 --> 00:01:36,360
What?

55
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,434
That's crazy.

56
00:01:37,434 --> 00:01:39,443
- Okay, okay, that was pretty good.

57
00:01:39,443 --> 00:01:40,389
I have to admit, that was pretty good.

58
00:01:40,389 --> 00:01:41,892
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

59
00:01:41,892 --> 00:01:43,883
- But I think I can do way better.

60
00:01:43,883 --> 00:01:45,364
- Oh, okay then, wow.

61
00:01:45,364 --> 00:01:47,808
Let the competition begin then, let's see this.

62
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:49,433
- [Lauren] We're going to take the queen of clubs,

63
00:01:49,433 --> 00:01:51,999
we're going to place it about, let's say,

64
00:01:51,999 --> 00:01:53,189
halfway in the deck.

65
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:54,704
- [Collins] All right, halfway in the deck.

66
00:01:54,704 --> 00:01:55,917
- [Lauren] Okay, just to clarify,

67
00:01:55,917 --> 00:01:58,303
we're going to make sure that the queen is not on top.

68
00:01:58,303 --> 00:01:59,476
- [Collins] It's not on top.

69
00:01:59,476 --> 00:02:00,706
- [Lauren] We're also going to make sure that it's

70
00:02:00,706 --> 00:02:01,919
not the second from the top.

71
00:02:01,919 --> 00:02:02,970
- [Collins] Not the second from the top.

72
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:03,803
- [Lauren] Or the third.

73
00:02:03,803 --> 00:02:06,482
- [Collins] Not third from the top.

74
00:02:06,482 --> 00:02:08,804
- [Lauren] And it's not in the top three, right?

75
00:02:08,804 --> 00:02:10,192
- That is absolutely correct,

76
00:02:10,192 --> 00:02:11,132
it's nowhere near the top at all.

77
00:02:11,132 --> 00:02:11,985
- All right.

78
00:02:11,985 --> 00:02:12,961
(giggles)

79
00:02:12,961 --> 00:02:14,115
So what I want you to do is I want you

80
00:02:14,115 --> 00:02:15,050
to snap your fingers.

81
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,123
(snaps)

82
00:02:17,123 --> 00:02:17,956
- What?!

83
00:02:18,922 --> 00:02:19,862
I don't know what just happened here.

84
00:02:19,862 --> 00:02:21,592
But let me see it, because actually watch,

85
00:02:21,592 --> 00:02:24,036
if I take this card right here, the four?

86
00:02:24,036 --> 00:02:26,550
Watch, come on in close, watch.

87
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,123
Just by snapping again, Lauren, snap.

88
00:02:28,123 --> 00:02:28,956
(snaps)

89
00:02:28,956 --> 00:02:29,789
You see because you actually, when you snap,

90
00:02:29,789 --> 00:02:31,913
you missed it and you actually didn't quite get the queen.

91
00:02:31,913 --> 00:02:34,148
It was there the whole time, it was.

92
00:02:34,148 --> 00:02:35,553
I was rooting for you.

93
00:02:35,553 --> 00:02:36,386
- What?

94
00:02:36,386 --> 00:02:37,701
- Okay, but watch this,

95
00:02:37,701 --> 00:02:39,071
look right here at the cards, all right.

96
00:02:39,071 --> 00:02:40,116
So watch the queen right here.

97
00:02:40,116 --> 00:02:41,509
The queen goes in the middle.

98
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:43,436
This one's insane, push it in, Lauren.

99
00:02:43,436 --> 00:02:44,269
Push it in.

100
00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:45,497
You'll see the moment it actually rises

101
00:02:45,497 --> 00:02:46,330
all the way to the top,

102
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:47,619
look at the queen, the four [Unintelligible].

103
00:02:47,619 --> 00:02:48,568
The four's on top.

104
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:51,047
Watch right here, watch the four.

105
00:02:51,047 --> 00:02:53,766
Look at, we go one, two, three

106
00:02:53,766 --> 00:02:54,599
(click)

107
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:56,752
four, like that.

108
00:02:56,752 --> 00:02:59,550
Queen actually melt all the way to the top.

109
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:00,383
- All right.

110
00:03:00,383 --> 00:03:02,470
- Now that is pretty insane, guys.

111
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,573
That's pretty.

112
00:03:03,573 --> 00:03:04,432
- Okay, okay.

113
00:03:04,432 --> 00:03:05,361
- Okay, yeah.

114
00:03:05,361 --> 00:03:08,217
- I have to say, that was even better than the last one.

115
00:03:08,217 --> 00:03:10,139
- Thank you so much, I really appreciate that.

116
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:11,311
- But I still can do better.

117
00:03:11,311 --> 00:03:12,606
- Okay then, let's see it.

118
00:03:12,606 --> 00:03:14,011
(laughs)

119
00:03:14,011 --> 00:03:15,833
- We're going to take the queen of clubs,

120
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:17,281
we're going to take it, we're going to place it about

121
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:18,431
halfway in this pile.

122
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:19,264
- [Collins] All right.

123
00:03:19,264 --> 00:03:20,097
- [Lauren] Please push that in.

124
00:03:20,097 --> 00:03:21,430
- [Collins] Push it in, okay.

125
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,577
Push it in.

126
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,696
(snaps)

127
00:03:24,696 --> 00:03:28,260
And I win, because that is not the correct card.

128
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,677
So that's offish.

129
00:03:32,731 --> 00:03:35,110
I think, I think that, at some point, that's just unfair.

130
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,054
Watch right here, look at this, queen.

131
00:03:37,054 --> 00:03:38,137
Goes in the middle.

132
00:03:38,137 --> 00:03:39,054
Push it in.

133
00:03:39,947 --> 00:03:41,465
All the way in the middle.

134
00:03:41,465 --> 00:03:43,038
I think it's about 23 cards down.

135
00:03:43,038 --> 00:03:44,287
This is an insane trick shot,

136
00:03:44,287 --> 00:03:45,593
if this wins, I win it all.

137
00:03:45,593 --> 00:03:46,480
Check it out, right here, watch,

138
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,856
one, two, and it's right.

139
00:03:47,856 --> 00:03:48,689
There.

140
00:03:51,292 --> 00:03:52,125
- Sorry.

141
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,469
- Well, we kind of split that one 50 50.

142
00:03:53,469 --> 00:03:55,060
We'll call this actually a draw.

143
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,337
If you guys enjoyed this video,

144
00:03:56,337 --> 00:03:57,817
be sure to give it a huge thumbs up,

145
00:03:57,817 --> 00:03:59,512
and I want you to comment down below,

146
00:03:59,512 --> 00:04:00,842
who should I visit next?

147
00:04:00,842 --> 00:04:02,885
Lauren actually has her very own magic channel.

148
00:04:02,885 --> 00:04:04,452
I'm going to put the link to it in the description

149
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:06,519
down below so be sure to go subscribe to her,

150
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:08,638
and also all of her social media links will be down there.

151
00:04:08,638 --> 00:04:10,346
Now make sure you guys, of course,

152
00:04:10,346 --> 00:04:11,484
subscribe to this channel.

153
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:12,477
Being a magician, I think you should

154
00:04:12,477 --> 00:04:13,310
make me disappear this time.

155
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,656
Let's try this.

156
00:04:14,656 --> 00:04:16,601
(snaps)

157
00:04:16,601 --> 00:04:18,406
Oh, party time.

158
00:04:18,406 --> 00:04:19,323
Turn it up!
