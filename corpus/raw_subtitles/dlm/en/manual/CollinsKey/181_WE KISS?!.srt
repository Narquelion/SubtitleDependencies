00:00:00,683 --> 00:00:02,097
(exciting music)

2
00:00:02,097 --> 00:00:02,930
- Yo, what's up, guys?

3
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:03,763
This Collins Key.

4
00:00:03,763 --> 00:00:04,596
I'm doing a meetup right now.

5
00:00:04,596 --> 00:00:05,710
I've got some friends who wanna say hi!

6
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:07,984
(cheering)

7
00:00:07,984 --> 00:00:08,948
Do you guys want to see some magic?

8
00:00:08,948 --> 00:00:10,289
(cheering)

9
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:11,490
- We're at the Santa Monica Promenade.

10
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:12,611
Why are we here, Collins?

11
00:00:12,611 --> 00:00:15,215
- Well, we are here, Sam, because we're doing this thing,

12
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:16,378
a little meetup here.

13
00:00:16,378 --> 00:00:19,117
- [Sam] Our boy Collins is gonna have a magic show.

14
00:00:19,117 --> 00:00:19,950
- [Collins] Magic.

15
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:21,250
- Well, let's go to it!

16
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:24,000
(exciting music)

17
00:00:29,074 --> 00:00:30,524
- [Crowd] No way!

18
00:00:30,524 --> 00:00:31,792
- You guys wanna try one more right now?

19
00:00:31,792 --> 00:00:34,072
(cheering)

20
00:00:34,072 --> 00:00:35,727
And I need one person to help me out for this.

21
00:00:35,727 --> 00:00:38,386
(cheering)

22
00:00:38,386 --> 00:00:39,220
- Let's hear it for her, everyone.

23
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:40,765
C'mon, let's hear it for her.

24
00:00:40,765 --> 00:00:41,598
(cheering)

25
00:00:41,598 --> 00:00:44,131
I want you to just touch any card you want.

26
00:00:44,131 --> 00:00:47,273
(driving electronic music)

27
00:00:47,273 --> 00:00:48,484
Show it to everyone, make sure everyone can see it.

28
00:00:48,484 --> 00:00:49,595
If I can have you sign it.

29
00:00:49,595 --> 00:00:50,517
Perfect, just like that.

30
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:52,410
Alright, let me see it.

31
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,361
Question mark, alright.

32
00:00:54,361 --> 00:00:55,287
So we're gonna take this card,

33
00:00:55,287 --> 00:00:57,003
and I want you to bite down on the card,

34
00:00:57,003 --> 00:00:57,853
Is that alright?

35
00:00:57,853 --> 00:00:59,377
Okay, alright, this will be my card.

36
00:00:59,377 --> 00:01:00,727
You have the king of diamonds.

37
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:01,902
I'm gonna sign it.

38
00:01:01,902 --> 00:01:03,148
This is where it's gonna get kinda wild.

39
00:01:03,148 --> 00:01:04,585
Ready for this?

40
00:01:04,585 --> 00:01:08,502
(suspenseful percussive music)

41
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,662
Your sign, ace.

42
00:01:24,662 --> 00:01:26,476
- [Crowd] No way!

43
00:01:26,476 --> 00:01:28,612
- So that means if I have now this ace of hearts,

44
00:01:28,612 --> 00:01:29,445
you've got one card.

45
00:01:29,445 --> 00:01:30,278
I want you to, yeah, take a look at it

46
00:01:30,278 --> 00:01:31,346
and show it to everyone.

47
00:01:31,346 --> 00:01:32,461
Is that it?

48
00:01:32,461 --> 00:01:34,544
(cheering)

49
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:36,989
Thank you so much for helping me out.

50
00:01:36,989 --> 00:01:39,289
Really quick, what was your name by the way?

51
00:01:39,289 --> 00:01:40,539
- Uh, the card.

52
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,514
- What?

53
00:01:43,514 --> 00:01:45,344
Wait a second, wait.

54
00:01:45,344 --> 00:01:47,435
She just left me like, an @ handle.

55
00:01:47,435 --> 00:01:48,885
It says like, UnlockAll.

56
00:01:48,885 --> 00:01:49,718
- Let me see.

57
00:01:49,718 --> 00:01:50,749
Do you know what that means?

58
00:01:50,749 --> 00:01:51,582
It says unlock all doors.

59
00:01:51,582 --> 00:01:52,415
I don't know.

60
00:01:52,415 --> 00:01:53,248
Is that?

61
00:01:53,248 --> 00:01:56,581
(slow percussive music)
