1
00:00:00,789 --> 00:00:01,755
(yelling)

2
00:00:01,755 --> 00:00:03,227
- New challenge has to mix together

3
00:00:03,227 --> 00:00:06,060
every slime we've ever made, right now, let's go!

4
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,814
I'm kicking off with with $1000 slime.

5
00:00:07,814 --> 00:00:09,177
- And I'm making metallic slime.

6
00:00:09,177 --> 00:00:10,126
- Let's go! - Dude!

7
00:00:10,126 --> 00:00:11,151
(thudding)

8
00:00:11,151 --> 00:00:12,553
(grunting) Yeet!

9
00:00:12,553 --> 00:00:14,173
And this is a competition of who can make

10
00:00:14,173 --> 00:00:16,740
the craziest mixed slime of all time.

11
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:17,724
In a mini pool.

12
00:00:17,724 --> 00:00:20,145
- Bro, my forearms are gonna be so tired after this!

13
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:21,696
- All right this one is all done, so Devan you can take

14
00:00:21,696 --> 00:00:22,786
that in your bucket. - Oh, whoa whoa whoa!

15
00:00:22,786 --> 00:00:24,603
- Oh, dude, I gotta add some shaving cream right now!

16
00:00:24,603 --> 00:00:26,735
- Bro, what, one glue bottle to go.

17
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:27,568
- Oh, sorry, sorry!

18
00:00:27,568 --> 00:00:28,401
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

19
00:00:28,401 --> 00:00:29,707
- Man, this just gonna take like so long.

20
00:00:29,707 --> 00:00:32,351
- Boom, last glue done, time to add the metallic stuff!

21
00:00:32,351 --> 00:00:34,312
- Yeah, so I got almost all my glue in.

22
00:00:34,312 --> 00:00:36,884
My final metallic thing is added, oh, wait, that's it?

23
00:00:36,884 --> 00:00:40,074
- Yep, that's it, do you see how much that is?

24
00:00:40,074 --> 00:00:42,482
I'm gonna add these packing peanuts now, there we go.

25
00:00:42,482 --> 00:00:43,442
- You have it a little bit on your nose.

26
00:00:43,442 --> 00:00:44,376
- I do? - It's like right--

27
00:00:44,376 --> 00:00:45,209
- No no no no no!

28
00:00:45,209 --> 00:00:46,730
- The real question is, I know I have another bucket

29
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:49,256
of glue in here somewhere, so i just got to, there we go!

30
00:00:49,256 --> 00:00:50,403
Oop, wrong side, fleet!

31
00:00:50,403 --> 00:00:52,017
It's the Aquaman move Devan, I turn into a shark

32
00:00:52,017 --> 00:00:52,920
and then I go like that.

33
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,516
- Oh, that seems like that's gonna

34
00:00:54,516 --> 00:00:55,962
get really tiring really fast.

35
00:00:55,962 --> 00:00:58,013
- Feels like a wade pool in here, slime wade pool.

36
00:00:58,013 --> 00:00:59,652
And think, we're only on the first slime, bro!

37
00:00:59,652 --> 00:01:01,033
There's so much more slime to be made.

38
00:01:01,033 --> 00:01:02,484
- You know where we put the mixer, bro?

39
00:01:02,484 --> 00:01:03,408
- I don't know, I don't remember,

40
00:01:03,408 --> 00:01:04,244
it's in one of the buckets.

41
00:01:04,244 --> 00:01:05,151
- Is it in one of yours?

42
00:01:05,151 --> 00:01:06,466
- Yeah, it might be in one of my buckets.

43
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:08,068
- [Devan] Okay!

44
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:08,901
(laughs) Huh?

45
00:01:08,901 --> 00:01:10,113
- Ooh, I got one, you ready for this?

46
00:01:10,113 --> 00:01:11,665
- Ah, dude! - Oh, dude!

47
00:01:11,665 --> 00:01:13,175
- Okay, all right, I think I'm good.

48
00:01:13,175 --> 00:01:14,008
- Are you okay?

49
00:01:14,008 --> 00:01:15,529
- Yeah, it's just a little slippery, you know?

50
00:01:15,529 --> 00:01:19,563
- Whoa, this looks so cool, dude, it's a metallic peanut!

51
00:01:19,563 --> 00:01:21,059
(laughs)

52
00:01:21,059 --> 00:01:22,770
- Oh, tiny Devan and his metallic peanut.

53
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:23,613
(laughs)

54
00:01:23,613 --> 00:01:25,971
- I'll let you, I don't have anything to say.

55
00:01:25,971 --> 00:01:28,554
- All right now it's time to add the Sta-Flo!

56
00:01:28,554 --> 00:01:31,134
Now it's time to add the Sta-Flo!

57
00:01:31,134 --> 00:01:32,751
That's a lot quicker than the glue.

58
00:01:32,751 --> 00:01:33,731
- All right, it's completely mixed up

59
00:01:33,731 --> 00:01:36,308
and now I'm gotta put the lid back on.

60
00:01:36,308 --> 00:01:37,641
Dude, what are you doing?

61
00:01:37,641 --> 00:01:38,970
- I'm adding my Sta-Flo.

62
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:39,803
- Yeah, but--

63
00:01:39,803 --> 00:01:41,145
- Huh, huh!

64
00:01:41,145 --> 00:01:41,978
- Whoa!

65
00:01:41,978 --> 00:01:43,648
- All right here we go, time to mix up my slime

66
00:01:43,648 --> 00:01:45,757
so here we go, three, two, one!

67
00:01:45,757 --> 00:01:48,423
- Oh, dude! - Okay, all right.

68
00:01:48,423 --> 00:01:50,015
- You know what Devan, I think so far I'm in the lead

69
00:01:50,015 --> 00:01:52,781
on this competition because my first slime is looking,

70
00:01:52,781 --> 00:01:54,682
well, not yet, but it's going to be great!

71
00:01:54,682 --> 00:01:55,771
All right, ah!

72
00:01:55,771 --> 00:01:56,729
- The inside of the blender

73
00:01:56,729 --> 00:01:57,945
looks awesome though, look at that!

74
00:01:57,945 --> 00:01:58,778
- Ooh! - Ooh!

75
00:01:58,778 --> 00:02:00,139
- Ooh! - Ooh!

76
00:02:00,139 --> 00:02:00,972
- Dude, this is so heavy

77
00:02:00,972 --> 00:02:02,863
it's like an exercise routine right now, man!

78
00:02:02,863 --> 00:02:04,230
- Dude, dude, dude, dude.

79
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,205
- Welcome to the Key Brothers Fitness routine!

80
00:02:06,205 --> 00:02:10,113
Right, left, right left, and then a double circle.

81
00:02:10,113 --> 00:02:11,961
The double circle, this is great for the shoulders, woo!

82
00:02:11,961 --> 00:02:13,526
Tap down, that's my max right there!

83
00:02:13,526 --> 00:02:14,859
I thought your slime would look a lot more

84
00:02:14,859 --> 00:02:16,215
satisfying but that-- - Whoa whoa whoa whoa!

85
00:02:16,215 --> 00:02:17,808
- Does not look satisfying! - Get that thing away!

86
00:02:17,808 --> 00:02:18,948
- Do not put your metallic, ew,

87
00:02:18,948 --> 00:02:21,069
how dare you put your pretty metallic stuff in my slime?

88
00:02:21,069 --> 00:02:23,857
- Are you serious, you got green all in my slime!

89
00:02:23,857 --> 00:02:26,677
- Get outta here metallic!

90
00:02:26,677 --> 00:02:27,887
- Wow, you really did a good job of getting that away.

91
00:02:27,887 --> 00:02:28,720
(laughs)

92
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,953
- Yeah, I'm actually kinda surprised.

93
00:02:29,953 --> 00:02:31,664
Now the tough part, time to transport

94
00:02:31,664 --> 00:02:35,462
$1000 worth of slime into my mini pool, so let's--

95
00:02:35,462 --> 00:02:36,295
- Welp, there's some of it.

96
00:02:36,295 --> 00:02:37,278
- All right, time to lift up the bucket,

97
00:02:37,278 --> 00:02:39,709
here we go, three, two, one!

98
00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:40,912
(laughs) What?

99
00:02:40,912 --> 00:02:42,810
- I remember that bucket, dude, that was so heavy.

100
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:43,948
- Can't tell if it glued to the table

101
00:02:43,948 --> 00:02:44,882
or just like really heavy.

102
00:02:44,882 --> 00:02:47,815
- Oh my gosh, this is like super difficult, you know what?

103
00:02:47,815 --> 00:02:49,543
I have an idea, this is gonna be a little bit difficult

104
00:02:49,543 --> 00:02:51,912
but I'm gonna see if I can get momentum on my side.

105
00:02:51,912 --> 00:02:52,874
So let's see if I got this, here we go!

106
00:02:52,874 --> 00:02:53,707
- You got this dude!

107
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:55,704
- Three, two, one!

108
00:02:55,704 --> 00:02:57,078
- Oh! - Oh!

109
00:02:57,078 --> 00:02:57,911
- No way!

110
00:02:57,911 --> 00:02:59,398
- Dude, I am an innovator and you know what,

111
00:02:59,398 --> 00:03:01,141
because I have so much glue and slime on the ground

112
00:03:01,141 --> 00:03:04,552
it's gonna make it easier to push along like this here.

113
00:03:04,552 --> 00:03:05,385
Ah, no wait, nevermind.

114
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:06,926
- And now it's stuck!

115
00:03:06,926 --> 00:03:08,009
This is not easy, all right.

116
00:03:08,009 --> 00:03:09,273
- You're sliding, does that thing

117
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:10,488
weight more than you do dude?

118
00:03:10,488 --> 00:03:11,907
- Yeah, this probably does, all right, here we go.

119
00:03:11,907 --> 00:03:14,254
Three, two, one! (buzzing)

120
00:03:14,254 --> 00:03:16,666
Nope, that's not gonna work, oh I forgot, fleet!

121
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:18,146
Oh, okay, you know what, if I put my thing like this

122
00:03:18,146 --> 00:03:19,563
and I lift it up.

123
00:03:20,495 --> 00:03:21,721
(pounding)

124
00:03:21,721 --> 00:03:23,508
- Dude, I completely missed it but you did it!

125
00:03:23,508 --> 00:03:25,995
- I did it, oh snap bro!

126
00:03:25,995 --> 00:03:27,645
Dude, this is awesome, here we go!

127
00:03:27,645 --> 00:03:29,500
First slime and add it in.

128
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,852
- Nicely done, oh!

129
00:03:30,852 --> 00:03:33,665
- Three, two, one, yeet!

130
00:03:33,665 --> 00:03:35,242
- Oh, and he cleared it all too!

131
00:03:35,242 --> 00:03:37,376
- Hey, bro, it's so much slime!

132
00:03:37,376 --> 00:03:38,768
All right, first slime is added in

133
00:03:38,768 --> 00:03:40,109
and now it's time for my next one.

134
00:03:40,109 --> 00:03:41,160
- Well I think mine's ready to go,

135
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,457
so I'm gonna add mine.

136
00:03:42,457 --> 00:03:43,389
- Woo-hoo-hoo!

137
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,577
- Collins, you ready for this super difficult process?

138
00:03:45,577 --> 00:03:46,410
- Yep!

139
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:50,135
- Here we go, three, two, one, yay!

140
00:03:50,135 --> 00:03:51,289
(laughs)

141
00:03:51,289 --> 00:03:52,275
It actually got me!

142
00:03:52,275 --> 00:03:53,184
- It's on your neck, it's like a little alien!

143
00:03:53,184 --> 00:03:54,809
- No no no no no no no, get those hands away!

144
00:03:54,809 --> 00:03:55,892
- All right, well, you know what,

145
00:03:55,892 --> 00:03:56,725
let's go for our next slime.

146
00:03:56,725 --> 00:03:57,936
Next up, I got volcano slime!

147
00:03:57,936 --> 00:04:00,897
- I got silly string slime, ah!

148
00:04:00,897 --> 00:04:02,991
- Devan, we do not, no, no no no no!

149
00:04:02,991 --> 00:04:03,884
We're not supposed to get messy!

150
00:04:03,884 --> 00:04:05,071
- What did you just do?

151
00:04:05,071 --> 00:04:05,904
(crickets)

152
00:04:05,904 --> 00:04:07,612
- Yeet, fleet!

153
00:04:07,612 --> 00:04:09,447

It's coming out, look at this, oh my gosh!

171
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:44,294
I have never made volcano slime that looks like this!

172
00:04:44,294 --> 00:04:45,296
Devan can you get that outta my hair.

173
00:04:45,296 --> 00:04:46,607
- This? - Yeah, whoa!

174
00:04:46,607 --> 00:04:47,690
- First up, I'm gonna add my glue.

175
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:50,476
- It like keeps bubbling bro, this is so cool!

176
00:04:50,476 --> 00:04:51,545
- Dude, look at that!

177
00:04:51,545 --> 00:04:53,331
- I gotta go on a mission, 'cause I need some more Sta-flo!

178
00:04:53,331 --> 00:04:54,711
Gonna make my way over here, ah!

179
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:55,846
- What is this?

180
00:04:55,846 --> 00:04:57,745
- Just gonna scoot, gonna scoot backwards

181
00:04:57,745 --> 00:04:59,409
'cause you can't fall if you go backwards.

182
00:04:59,409 --> 00:05:01,034
Let's see where we, ah, all right, here we go!

183
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:02,205
Oh, perfect, got the Sta-flo, all right.

184
00:05:02,205 --> 00:05:03,638
Just gonna do a little bit of bowling with the Sta-flo,

185
00:05:03,638 --> 00:05:05,960
here we go, three, two, one.

186
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,977
- Oh! - That didn't go too far.

187
00:05:07,977 --> 00:05:08,810
- Ah!

188
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:09,833
- Look at this. (laughs)

189
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,365
- Whoa, what kinda silly string is that, man?

190
00:05:11,365 --> 00:05:12,359
- I don't know, it's my favorite though.

191
00:05:12,359 --> 00:05:13,824
- All right, we're taking the slime game seriously

192
00:05:13,824 --> 00:05:14,657
right now, so here we go.

193
00:05:14,657 --> 00:05:16,017
- Got it in my hair dude. - Right over here like this.

194
00:05:16,017 --> 00:05:18,484
Pull it up and now for the dip, we gotta go, ah!

195
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:19,317
Didn't think that through!

196
00:05:19,317 --> 00:05:20,358
- What'd you do? - I got it, stop!

197
00:05:20,358 --> 00:05:22,097
- Aye aye aye, aye aye!

198
00:05:22,097 --> 00:05:23,675
Just giving you little pointers dude!

199
00:05:23,675 --> 00:05:25,653
- Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa, no no, really dude?

200
00:05:25,653 --> 00:05:27,422
- I will, I should run!

201
00:05:27,422 --> 00:05:28,526
(laughs)

202
00:05:28,526 --> 00:05:31,629
I'm stuck, I can't run, why can't I run, pfft!

203
00:05:31,629 --> 00:05:32,858
Man this is horrible!

204
00:05:32,858 --> 00:05:35,323
- I can do this all day, am I getting you still?

205
00:05:35,323 --> 00:05:36,156
- Pfft, pfft!

206
00:05:36,156 --> 00:05:37,741
- Whoa! - Let's go!

207
00:05:37,741 --> 00:05:39,358
- You're totally gonna lose this now!

208
00:05:39,358 --> 00:05:40,306
- All right, well there you go!

209
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:41,216
- Truce? - Truce.

210
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:44,822
- Well I'm coming back down now, woo, wee, oh, that's cool!

211
00:05:44,822 --> 00:05:47,899
All right, now we're done with that Sta-flo, fleet!

212
00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:49,009
- Okay.

213
00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:50,594
- Mix this up here, this is the most fun

214
00:05:50,594 --> 00:05:52,099
I have ever had making slime,

215
00:05:52,099 --> 00:05:54,650
but this is the perfect slime situation right now man.

216
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:56,880
- I know man, you can just make a mess and have no problem!

217
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,095
- Well this is out last slime video so we gotta go all out

218
00:06:00,095 --> 00:06:02,255
for the final one man, 'cause this is just, woohoo!

219
00:06:02,255 --> 00:06:03,563
This is so much fun!

220
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:05,348
All right, you know what, I gotta grab my test tubey thingy

221
00:06:05,348 --> 00:06:07,784
and then we're just gonna pop this in here, gonna fill it.

222
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,123
Dude, this like what Spider Man must feel like

223
00:06:09,123 --> 00:06:10,569
'cause bro look at this, like I'm not even touching it

224
00:06:10,569 --> 00:06:12,402
but I'm like a web master bro,

225
00:06:12,402 --> 00:06:14,013
I'm just keeping it midair with my skills.

226
00:06:14,013 --> 00:06:14,846
- Yeah.

227
00:06:14,846 --> 00:06:16,061
- All right, now mine's ready to be added to the mini pool,

228
00:06:16,061 --> 00:06:17,431
but I wanna see if I can grab it all at once

229
00:06:17,431 --> 00:06:19,412
without having to use the bucket, so here we go!

230
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:21,109
- Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa!

231
00:06:21,109 --> 00:06:21,942
- Ah!

232
00:06:21,942 --> 00:06:23,004
- I mean you're technically kinda use the bucket.

233
00:06:23,004 --> 00:06:24,321
- Here we go, we gotta bring the bucket back over here.

234
00:06:24,321 --> 00:06:25,703
(laughs)

235
00:06:25,703 --> 00:06:27,082
- Ow, I learn from my mistakes.

236
00:06:27,082 --> 00:06:30,164
And I got it, and we're going and we're off

237
00:06:30,164 --> 00:06:31,895
and we're here, all right, here we go!

238
00:06:31,895 --> 00:06:32,728
- It's on your leg!

239
00:06:32,728 --> 00:06:34,105
- Here we go, and then-- - Wow!

240
00:06:34,105 --> 00:06:35,379
- Just get it to drip all the way like this.

241
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:37,740
I feel like a slime monster, oh snap, that's super cool.

242
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,887
It comes right off with it like that.

243
00:06:38,887 --> 00:06:40,109
- All right, first two slimes are in,

244
00:06:40,109 --> 00:06:41,111
now it's time to get my next one.

245
00:06:41,111 --> 00:06:43,042
- What, you're moving on without me, I'm not even done.

246
00:06:43,042 --> 00:06:44,647
- Getting late Devan, you're taking way too long.

247
00:06:44,647 --> 00:06:45,522
So here we go, let's see. - What?

248
00:06:45,522 --> 00:06:47,494
- I wanna go for this bucket over here.

249
00:06:47,494 --> 00:06:49,765
- Woo, that is cool!

250
00:06:49,765 --> 00:06:52,543
- Now I gotta get my bucket over to my table!

251
00:06:52,543 --> 00:06:53,949
See what we got here, yeet!

252
00:06:53,949 --> 00:06:56,119
- What happened, like? - Woo, breakfast slime, bro!

253
00:06:56,119 --> 00:06:57,133
- Oh! - Oh!

254
00:06:57,133 --> 00:06:59,230
- And eggs, bro this might get crazy, all right.

255
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,437
So let's see, you know what, in hindsight

256
00:07:00,437 --> 00:07:01,825
I probably shouldn't have dumped the eggs out like that.

257
00:07:01,825 --> 00:07:03,676
All right, you know what, first ingredient

258
00:07:03,676 --> 00:07:05,669
I'm gonna be adding is my eggs, so.

259
00:07:05,669 --> 00:07:06,502
- Oh!

260
00:07:06,502 --> 00:07:07,335
- But they're gonna get the shells.

261
00:07:07,335 --> 00:07:08,480
- Oh!

262
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,465
- Wait wait wait, I wanna try, three, two, one!

263
00:07:10,465 --> 00:07:11,948
- Oh! - Yeah!

264
00:07:11,948 --> 00:07:12,781
(gasp)

265
00:07:12,781 --> 00:07:13,777
- You know what?

266
00:07:13,777 --> 00:07:14,990
- What, what is that for?

267
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:15,823
- I'm sorry!

268
00:07:15,823 --> 00:07:18,244
- No, you get all the-- - Ah, ah!

269
00:07:18,244 --> 00:07:20,163
No no no, aye aye aye aye, relax!

270
00:07:20,163 --> 00:07:21,960
The handshake of truth, we must both break an egg

271
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,091
over this handshake, three, two, one!

272
00:07:24,091 --> 00:07:25,533
- Ah! - Yours didn't even break.

273
00:07:25,533 --> 00:07:26,991
- That's not a truce!

274
00:07:26,991 --> 00:07:27,892
- Oh, dude, what are you doing?

275
00:07:27,892 --> 00:07:29,532
- It wasn't a truce, yours didn't break.

276
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:30,999
Why are we holding hands, you know what?

277
00:07:30,999 --> 00:07:33,556
- No no no no no no no no no - for you!

278
00:07:33,556 --> 00:07:34,552
(laughs)

279
00:07:34,552 --> 00:07:35,566
Dude, I can't believe you got so much egg

280
00:07:35,566 --> 00:07:36,928
in my hair man, I'm not happy about that.

281
00:07:36,928 --> 00:07:37,770
- You got it all in my hair.

282
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,904
- Well, sorry, it looks good in your hair, Devan, I promise.

283
00:07:39,904 --> 00:07:40,737
- What? - Okay.

284
00:07:40,737 --> 00:07:42,041
I'm just gonna add some glue in right now, so let's see.

285
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:44,447
Oh man, I feel like an artist right now, there we go.

286
00:07:44,447 --> 00:07:45,280
- Dude dude dude dude! - Oh!

287
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,453
A little bit over there!

288
00:07:47,453 --> 00:07:49,120
- I don't know, yeah, using you as a buffer.

289
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,203
- No no, stay over there!

290
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,223
- Bread, yeah!

291
00:07:55,223 --> 00:07:56,574
- You better not throw that at me.

292
00:07:56,574 --> 00:07:58,725
- It's some french jam toast! - I will throw this at you!

293
00:07:58,725 --> 00:08:01,058
(yells)

294
00:08:01,058 --> 00:08:02,037
(laughs)

295
00:08:02,037 --> 00:08:03,862
- You know what, I'm gonna add your slime to my pool!

296
00:08:03,862 --> 00:08:05,746
Here we go, three, two-- - No you're not!

297
00:08:05,746 --> 00:08:06,579
- Ah!

298
00:08:06,579 --> 00:08:08,979
Again, this is my slime, this is mine!

299
00:08:08,979 --> 00:08:10,530
- Then I'll get half of it! - This is my slime!

300
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:11,696
- Exactly! - Just gonna add this in!

301
00:08:11,696 --> 00:08:12,529
- No, you better not!

302
00:08:12,529 --> 00:08:13,362
- There we go, there, it's in!

303
00:08:13,362 --> 00:08:14,570
- No no no no!

304
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:15,548
(laughs)

305
00:08:15,548 --> 00:08:16,381
- No!

306
00:08:16,381 --> 00:08:18,330
(yells)

307
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:19,346
- I'll take some of your then!

308
00:08:19,346 --> 00:08:21,016
(grunting)

309
00:08:21,016 --> 00:08:21,880
I got it!

310
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,969
(boing)

311
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:24,407
- That bounced back and hit me!

312
00:08:24,407 --> 00:08:26,244
- Let's play a game, who's got the most wack foot!

313
00:08:26,244 --> 00:08:27,330
- I will easily win this, here we go,

314
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:29,036
three, two, one, present your most wack!

315
00:08:29,036 --> 00:08:29,869
I personally think that mine with

316
00:08:29,869 --> 00:08:31,123
the egg cartons gets most wack.

317
00:08:31,123 --> 00:08:31,956
- Yeah, it is.

318
00:08:31,956 --> 00:08:32,932
- Ow!

319
00:08:32,932 --> 00:08:37,432
Three, two, one, boom, slam drunk, sports, sports, oh!

320
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:40,416
(boing)

321
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:42,877
Sports, so much sports!

322
00:08:42,877 --> 00:08:43,948
- Here we go.

323
00:08:43,948 --> 00:08:46,637
- Oh man, all right Devan, for your final piece of slime,

324
00:08:46,637 --> 00:08:48,742
I've got it right here and batter up, you ready?

325
00:08:48,742 --> 00:08:49,575
- Yeah, I'm ready.

326
00:08:49,575 --> 00:08:52,042
- Here we go, three, two, one and pitch!

327
00:08:52,042 --> 00:08:52,906
(thud)

328
00:08:52,906 --> 00:08:53,891
(cheers)

329
00:08:53,891 --> 00:08:55,011
- Dude, what?

330
00:08:55,011 --> 00:08:56,709
- For the championship bro.

331
00:08:56,709 --> 00:08:58,540
(cheers)

332
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,101
- Yeah! - Yeah!

333
00:09:00,101 --> 00:09:01,506
- All right, well you know now I gotta finish up my slime

334
00:09:01,506 --> 00:09:03,101
so let's be very careful here.

335
00:09:03,101 --> 00:09:03,934
- I need my next slime!

336
00:09:03,934 --> 00:09:05,803
- Oh snap, Devan's already got his next slime.

337
00:09:05,803 --> 00:09:06,636
Well I'm gonna finish up mine.

338
00:09:06,636 --> 00:09:08,061
- Oh, ow!

339
00:09:08,061 --> 00:09:09,418
- What, you slipped? - I totally slipped.

340
00:09:09,418 --> 00:09:10,251
- Whoopsie!

341
00:09:10,251 --> 00:09:12,219
- All right, I'm knocking stuff over.

342
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:13,520
- Oh my God dude, you okay? - I think I got it.

343
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,353
Yep!

344
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:15,186
(laughs)

345
00:09:15,186 --> 00:09:17,794
- You broke the bucket, wow! - Wow!

346
00:09:17,794 --> 00:09:18,627
- That's bad.

347
00:09:18,627 --> 00:09:19,552
- Should I just make my slime up here?

348
00:09:19,552 --> 00:09:22,112
- Well I mean hey, if we're gonna go for it bro, wee!

349
00:09:22,112 --> 00:09:23,462
(laughs) - My feet are so sticky now.

350
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:25,228
- Stay on your feet, all right, whoa!

351
00:09:25,228 --> 00:09:27,199
(laughs)

352
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:28,101
It's the eggs.

353
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:29,021
- All right, ready?

354
00:09:29,021 --> 00:09:30,101
- Yep! - Yeet!

355
00:09:30,101 --> 00:09:31,835
(thud)

356
00:09:31,835 --> 00:09:33,131
- There we go, dude it is getting

357
00:09:33,131 --> 00:09:35,381
so cold out here right now.

358
00:09:36,965 --> 00:09:39,053
- Ah, I know you can see my breath!

359
00:09:39,053 --> 00:09:41,403
Ah, everything spilled bro!

360
00:09:41,403 --> 00:09:43,180
- Speaking of all spilled, I got more eggs!

361
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,013
- No!

362
00:09:44,013 --> 00:09:46,424
You remember the game Devan, is it raw or is it hard boiled?

363
00:09:46,424 --> 00:09:47,918
- Raw, oh!

364
00:09:47,918 --> 00:09:49,190
- Yep, it's raw, raw or hard boiled?

365
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,744
- It's raw!

366
00:09:50,744 --> 00:09:51,577
- Yep! - Yeah!

367
00:09:51,577 --> 00:09:52,410
- Raw or hard boiled?

368
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:54,395
- I think it's raw.

369
00:09:54,395 --> 00:09:58,188
- Man, oh, (laughs) I forgot these were all fresh eggs.

370
00:09:58,188 --> 00:09:59,765
- They're all raw! - They're all fresh eggs bro!

371
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,005
- You know what, that's--

372
00:10:01,005 --> 00:10:01,838
- Nope!

373
00:10:01,838 --> 00:10:02,754
- Man, these are not breaking over the toast!

374
00:10:02,754 --> 00:10:03,883
This just is not doing anything.

375
00:10:03,883 --> 00:10:06,936
- You know, just get away, no, don't, don't you dare!

376
00:10:06,936 --> 00:10:08,246
- Wanna have it? - No, I don't.

377
00:10:08,246 --> 00:10:09,102
- Want an egg? - I don't.

378
00:10:09,102 --> 00:10:09,935
- Want some breakfast? - No!

379
00:10:09,935 --> 00:10:10,969
- Pick up the baseball bat!

380
00:10:10,969 --> 00:10:11,802
- No! - I have an idea!

381
00:10:11,802 --> 00:10:12,746
- I'm safe behind him.

382
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:13,765
- Oh, you know, now we got the bread,

383
00:10:13,765 --> 00:10:15,460
you know, the nice little french toast bread,

384
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,681
let's give it a yeet, yeet, yeet!

385
00:10:17,681 --> 00:10:18,950
Oh, hey! (laughs)

386
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,128
- Oh, Collins!

387
00:10:20,128 --> 00:10:22,347
- You little bread boy, I see you with your little eggs!

388
00:10:22,347 --> 00:10:24,083
- You missed. - Ow, french toast!

389
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:24,916
- You missed.

390
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,179
- I got more french toast, toast to the french!

391
00:10:26,179 --> 00:10:27,012
- You missed.

392
00:10:27,012 --> 00:10:29,165
- You know what, Devan, that was foolish.

393
00:10:29,165 --> 00:10:30,091
- Take your piece of bread.

394
00:10:30,091 --> 00:10:32,442
- I don't want it anymore, you got it all nasty.

395
00:10:32,442 --> 00:10:34,466
Oh, dude, come on bro, you gotta stop it, okay?

396
00:10:34,466 --> 00:10:35,299
- No, no.

397
00:10:35,299 --> 00:10:37,417
- Do it, three, two, one, there we go, perfect!

398
00:10:37,417 --> 00:10:38,585
- I can't do it any other way.

399
00:10:38,585 --> 00:10:41,890
- Oh, oh, oh, oh, I have an idea!

400
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:45,640
Three, two, one, ah, oh yes, this is a dream!

401
00:10:47,386 --> 00:10:48,633
This is so much fun!

402
00:10:48,633 --> 00:10:49,466
- Ah, it looks so good.

403
00:10:49,466 --> 00:10:51,546
- I know, right, this the most amount of eggs I have ever

404
00:10:51,546 --> 00:10:53,593
added to anything, like anything in my entire life.

405
00:10:53,593 --> 00:10:56,931
Dude imagine, woo, putting this into a huge omelet.

406
00:10:56,931 --> 00:10:58,888
- You can do that on your own time, Collins.

407
00:10:58,888 --> 00:11:00,752
- All right, gonna pop an egg in here, right now, this, oh!

408
00:11:00,752 --> 00:11:02,228
Just get some bread in here, all right,

409
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:04,355
then we're gonna mix it all up.

410
00:11:04,355 --> 00:11:05,432
That sounded really crazy, all right,

411
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:07,801
just gonna shake this all up and then we're gonna add it in.

412
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:09,249
The weirdest thing is like I'll find like these full eggs

413
00:11:09,249 --> 00:11:10,582
and then just have to pop 'em,

414
00:11:10,582 --> 00:11:11,835
ah, into the slime, so there we go, perfect.

415
00:11:11,835 --> 00:11:13,532
- I got an itch, I got an itch, it's right there!

416
00:11:13,532 --> 00:11:14,365
- Want me to get it for you?

417
00:11:14,365 --> 00:11:15,267
- Yeah, no, no no no no!

418
00:11:15,267 --> 00:11:16,248
- Just using my bread!

419
00:11:16,248 --> 00:11:17,081
- No!

420
00:11:17,081 --> 00:11:18,483
- It patented, it's great for itches!

421
00:11:18,483 --> 00:11:19,532
- I got it, look at this.

422
00:11:19,532 --> 00:11:21,214
- That's the most beautiful slime you've mad yet

423
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:22,047
and it's not even a slime.

424
00:11:22,047 --> 00:11:23,440
All right, you know, I think this has gotten to a point

425
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,486
where now it's time to add this to my mini pool.

426
00:11:25,486 --> 00:11:26,842
All right, so this is how you deliver a package

427
00:11:26,842 --> 00:11:31,241
of egg slime, close up the top and then, fleet!

428
00:11:31,241 --> 00:11:32,949
You think I can chuck this from here into the pool?

429
00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:33,782
- Yes!

430
00:11:33,782 --> 00:11:36,195
- I think I can it 'cause with the momentum here,

431
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:39,528
the bag of bread, three, two, one, yeah!

432
00:11:40,532 --> 00:11:41,665
(cheers)

433
00:11:41,665 --> 00:11:42,498
- I did it!

434
00:11:42,498 --> 00:11:43,331
- You did! - Hug me!

435
00:11:43,331 --> 00:11:44,414
- Yes! - Yes!

436
00:11:44,414 --> 00:11:46,485
- But now you have to get it out of the bucket still.

437
00:11:46,485 --> 00:11:48,142
- Well first of all gotta get my first egg slime in,

438
00:11:48,142 --> 00:11:50,265
so here we go, just gotta chuck that in there.

439
00:11:50,265 --> 00:11:52,537
Got my bad of bread, oh, there we go, woohoo!

440
00:11:52,537 --> 00:11:54,430
(yells)

441
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:55,977
All right so here we go, I'm just gonna add the bucket in.

442
00:11:55,977 --> 00:11:59,144
Three, two one, a lift and a drop, oh!

443
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:02,157
- That sounded so gross.

444
00:12:02,157 --> 00:12:06,182
- It is not lovely, let's now mix it, ow, these egg shells.

445
00:12:06,182 --> 00:12:08,221
Got to mix it up regardless, oh man, it's so tough.

446
00:12:08,221 --> 00:12:09,466
- Sounds like you're struggling bro.

447
00:12:09,466 --> 00:12:11,798
- $1000 slime's first was not a smart idea bro

448
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:13,671
'cause it's like, ah, it's tough.

449
00:12:13,671 --> 00:12:16,078
- I'm enjoying your struggle.

450
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:17,600
- I need to take a nap, all right well right now

451
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,223
it's time for the next slime, so let's go grab it.

452
00:12:20,223 --> 00:12:23,445
(suspenseful music)

453
00:12:23,445 --> 00:12:24,278
- Whoa, whoa whoa whoa whoa, bro!

454
00:12:24,278 --> 00:12:25,111
- I have a mystery ingredient.

455
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:26,502
- No. - Yes, sriracha sauce.

456
00:12:26,502 --> 00:12:28,002
- Why, no, get that outta here!

457
00:12:28,002 --> 00:12:29,323
- Gonna make your slime way better Devan, I promise.

458
00:12:29,323 --> 00:12:30,156
- No.

459
00:12:30,156 --> 00:12:31,831
- I'll just add a little bit in here just to make sure

460
00:12:31,831 --> 00:12:32,914
you're enjoying there, all right,

461
00:12:32,914 --> 00:12:34,518
great, we got you all your sriracha sauce.

462
00:12:34,518 --> 00:12:35,882
Gotta add a little bit of spice to the competition,

463
00:12:35,882 --> 00:12:37,343
know what I mean, so let's see, I wanna see what slimes

464
00:12:37,343 --> 00:12:40,132
we got over here. (yells)

465
00:12:40,132 --> 00:12:41,209
- Why are you going to my side?

466
00:12:41,209 --> 00:12:42,870
- Oh, snap, gonna grab little from the foam things

467
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:45,036
and also I gotta grab a baseball bat but unfortunately,

468
00:12:45,036 --> 00:12:46,352
I had a little sriracha sauce on it right now.

469
00:12:46,352 --> 00:12:47,950
All right, so here we go, I got my next slime.

470
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:50,039
- I'm just gonna try to mix it as quickly as possible

471
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:50,872
before it all--

472
00:12:50,872 --> 00:12:53,854
- Oh dude, oh my God, the sriracha sauce rocking, smell it.

473
00:12:53,854 --> 00:12:55,543
First up, getting little foam balls.

474
00:12:55,543 --> 00:12:56,376
(laughs)

475
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:58,046
- And as usual, you're super far ahead of me dude.

476
00:12:58,046 --> 00:12:59,181
- Exactly, all right, here we go.

477
00:12:59,181 --> 00:13:00,227
Just gonna have to.

478
00:13:00,227 --> 00:13:01,565
- Whoa whoa whoa whoa!

479
00:13:01,565 --> 00:13:03,354
- There we go, just gonna make it, you know, nice and good!

480
00:13:03,354 --> 00:13:04,187
Wee!

481
00:13:04,187 --> 00:13:05,020
Almost fell backwards!

482
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,149
And that really isn't working too well, you know what--

483
00:13:06,149 --> 00:13:07,062
- Crush it with your hands.

484
00:13:07,062 --> 00:13:07,895
- Here we go, let's do it.

485
00:13:07,895 --> 00:13:09,326
Let glue drop on it, three, two, one!

486
00:13:09,326 --> 00:13:11,127
(thuds)

487
00:13:11,127 --> 00:13:13,157
Dude, I have a revolutionary of adding the food coloring

488
00:13:13,157 --> 00:13:15,216
when it's time bro, that's gonna be a game changer.

489
00:13:15,216 --> 00:13:17,657
But right now, gonna tear this stuff up.

490
00:13:17,657 --> 00:13:19,872
This is not easy.

491
00:13:19,872 --> 00:13:22,205
- I feel like you picked all the most difficult slimes, bro.

492
00:13:22,205 --> 00:13:23,051
- I think I really did, man.

493
00:13:23,051 --> 00:13:24,339
All right, gonna add some filler beads now.

494
00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:25,765
So just gonna add those in just like that.

495
00:13:25,765 --> 00:13:27,133
You know what, I'm gonna get some of your filler beads in

496
00:13:27,133 --> 00:13:28,917
over here, whoa, are these all the way empty?

497
00:13:28,917 --> 00:13:29,939
- Yeah dude, I used them all.

498
00:13:29,939 --> 00:13:31,774
- Let's do it, just try to get any last bits

499
00:13:31,774 --> 00:13:33,186
I can out of 'em, should be enough there for mine.

500
00:13:33,186 --> 00:13:34,019
Okay, so let's see here.

501
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:35,595
- Dude, really, you got it all over my face!

502
00:13:35,595 --> 00:13:36,428
- I'm sorry!

503
00:13:36,428 --> 00:13:38,312
- All right now it's time to add my next slime,

504
00:13:38,312 --> 00:13:39,909
gonna try and use the toss method.

505
00:13:39,909 --> 00:13:40,742
- Need help at all?

506
00:13:40,742 --> 00:13:41,575
- Three, two, one!

507
00:13:41,575 --> 00:13:42,408
- Bro it's like broken!

508
00:13:42,408 --> 00:13:43,241
- Oh, I did it.

509
00:13:43,241 --> 00:13:44,755
- No, dude, you broke it every way.

510
00:13:44,755 --> 00:13:45,694
- Everything is like coming out!

511
00:13:45,694 --> 00:13:47,361
- Ah, yes, I did it!

512
00:13:48,198 --> 00:13:49,626
- That's so good bro.

513
00:13:49,626 --> 00:13:50,459
- Yes!

514
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:51,292
(clapping)

515
00:13:51,292 --> 00:13:52,138
- Congratulations! - What happened to my pool?

516
00:13:52,138 --> 00:13:52,971
- What?

517
00:13:52,971 --> 00:13:53,804
- What happened to my pool?

518
00:13:53,804 --> 00:13:54,637
- What do you mean?

519
00:13:54,637 --> 00:13:55,470
- It's all popped.

520
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:56,413
- I mean hey, it's slime, things happen, right?

521
00:13:56,413 --> 00:13:59,233
- Time of grab my next slime, dude, what are you doing?

522
00:13:59,233 --> 00:14:00,453
- Getting out my glue man!

523
00:14:00,453 --> 00:14:01,286
All right here we go.

524
00:14:01,286 --> 00:14:03,029
- We have so many slimes left bro.

525
00:14:03,029 --> 00:14:05,029
Oh, it's snow slime bro!

526
00:14:06,417 --> 00:14:07,250
Dude!

527
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,831
- I had to chop it, ah, I was dripping glue

528
00:14:08,831 --> 00:14:10,576
all over my leg that whole time.

529
00:14:10,576 --> 00:14:11,813
All right we got the mixing baseball bat,

530
00:14:11,813 --> 00:14:13,209
so here we go, just gonna pop this in here

531
00:14:13,209 --> 00:14:14,718
and mash it all up.

532
00:14:14,718 --> 00:14:16,321
(banging)

533
00:14:16,321 --> 00:14:18,607
- You just breached your, what are you doing?

534
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:21,324
- I think my bucket is better without corners.

535
00:14:21,324 --> 00:14:22,157
- What?

536
00:14:22,157 --> 00:14:22,990
- Do I have something on my face?

537
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:23,832
- You do.

538
00:14:23,832 --> 00:14:25,856
- All right, here we go, is it off my face?

539
00:14:25,856 --> 00:14:26,689
- It is.

540
00:14:26,689 --> 00:14:27,522
- Ah, just like that, it's easy, all right, here we go.

541
00:14:27,522 --> 00:14:28,692
- Hang on, don't, whoa, hey, hey,

542
00:14:28,692 --> 00:14:31,286
it is my turn to add this dude, I'm just going for it.

543
00:14:31,286 --> 00:14:32,614
- I don't know how I'm gonna turn this into slime though.

544
00:14:32,614 --> 00:14:33,953
You know what, I don't think this bucket is helping at all

545
00:14:33,953 --> 00:14:37,752
so I gotta scoop it off the bucket here, whoa!

546
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:39,740
Fleet, perfect.

547
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,444
- Dude I love this stuff, it's so cool.

548
00:14:41,444 --> 00:14:43,072
- Table top slime, gotta get the, fleet!

549
00:14:43,072 --> 00:14:44,743
Gotta get that outta there, wait, here we go!

550
00:14:44,743 --> 00:14:47,185
- This can't be snow slime, snow isn't pink.

551
00:14:47,185 --> 00:14:48,677
(banging)

552
00:14:48,677 --> 00:14:51,325
Dude, you're spending too long on all of your slimes.

553
00:14:51,325 --> 00:14:52,857
- See, the thing is of it, I don't win these challenges

554
00:14:52,857 --> 00:14:54,713
a lot, okay, so I really gotta go all out

555
00:14:54,713 --> 00:14:55,795
to try to win these challenges.

556
00:14:55,795 --> 00:14:58,951
- But dude, we have so many slimes and it's already so late.

557
00:14:58,951 --> 00:15:01,085
Ah, this feels so cool.

558
00:15:01,085 --> 00:15:02,480
- All right, just mixing it together like this.

559
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,325
Oh man, 'cause look at that beautiful slime.

560
00:15:04,325 --> 00:15:05,484
- Dude, mine's really good.

561
00:15:05,484 --> 00:15:07,302
- Dude, I forgot about the pancake batter,

562
00:15:07,302 --> 00:15:10,407
I didn't add it to my breakfast slime.

563
00:15:10,407 --> 00:15:12,558
- That worked, all right, mine is actually ready to add.

564
00:15:12,558 --> 00:15:14,025
- And mine's pretty ready to add as well.

565
00:15:14,025 --> 00:15:14,858
So you know what? - Oh, really?

566
00:15:14,858 --> 00:15:16,695

568
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:19,984
Doing some of it in there.

569
00:15:19,984 --> 00:15:21,481
- There we go, that's a big amount in there.

570
00:15:21,481 --> 00:15:22,580
- I like it!

571
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,777
- There we go, that's another nice bit

572
00:15:23,777 --> 00:15:24,610
right there and then there--

573
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:25,697
- Oh, I need, what are you doing?

574
00:15:25,697 --> 00:15:27,633
- I'm just chucking all my table top slime in there.

575
00:15:27,633 --> 00:15:28,466
- All right, I'm picking my next slime.

576
00:15:28,466 --> 00:15:29,299
- You know what Devan, no.

577
00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:30,196
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

578
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:31,277
- There we go, almost got 'em.

579
00:15:31,277 --> 00:15:34,271
It's time for me to pick my next one, so, yeet, ah!

580
00:15:34,271 --> 00:15:35,298
- I got a cap in my foot.

581
00:15:35,298 --> 00:15:36,131
(laughs)

582
00:15:36,131 --> 00:15:36,964
- Oh, you need me to get rid of this for you?

583
00:15:36,964 --> 00:15:37,797
- What, yeah.

584
00:15:37,797 --> 00:15:38,881
- I have my own recycling service

585
00:15:38,881 --> 00:15:40,919
Devan, it's called Yeet Recycling.

586
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:42,173
Wanna guess what happens?

587
00:15:42,173 --> 00:15:43,181
- I have no clue.

588
00:15:43,181 --> 00:15:44,950
- We deet, all right, time to pick my next slime.

So, we're off and at it, all right, let's see here.

590
00:15:46,709 --> 00:15:48,304
Where do I want to go?

591
00:15:48,304 --> 00:15:49,752
- These sponges are so thick.

592
00:15:49,752 --> 00:15:50,585
(yells)

593
00:15:50,585 --> 00:15:52,754
- Yes, dude, I found a great one.

594
00:15:52,754 --> 00:15:53,837
- Oh!

595
00:15:53,837 --> 00:15:54,927
- Woo-hoo! - What?

596
00:15:54,927 --> 00:15:56,036
- You're gonna have to watch out bro.

597
00:15:56,036 --> 00:15:58,803
Here we go, three, two, one, okay, that was great.

00:15:58,803 --> 00:15:59,985
Wait, so like, what kinda slime is this?

We got cut up straws, beads, got corn starch,

601
00:16:04,209 --> 00:16:05,307
Like, what kinda slime is this?

602
00:16:05,307 --> 00:16:07,876
Oh, it's too much ingredients slime!

00:16:07,876 --> 00:16:08,709
- Oh, that's right.

604
00:16:08,709 --> 00:16:10,953
- For the final one, we're gonna add all the ingredients.

605
00:16:10,953 --> 00:16:11,786

609
00:16:18,912 --> 00:16:20,370
- Woohoo, yeet!

610
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:21,407
- All right, much better!

611
00:16:21,407 --> 00:16:22,730
- All right now it's time to add in too many ingredients,

612
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:24,162

00:16:38,824 --> 00:16:40,723
that's gonna give great quality right now, so let's see.

622
00:16:40,723 --> 00:16:42,551
Let's just pop the cornstarch in here just like this.

623
00:16:42,551 --> 00:16:43,862
Oh man, when I start mixing it,

624
00:16:43,862 --> 00:16:45,366
this stuff is going to be wild.

625
00:16:45,366 --> 00:16:47,456
Ooh man, yeet, this is the greatest thing!

626
00:16:47,456 --> 00:16:48,881
Oh, we even got some face mask, woohoo!

00:16:57,273 --> 00:16:58,941
- Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa, can't do that, Is it on me?

634
00:16:58,941 --> 00:17:00,818
- All right gonna add some squishes.

635
00:17:00,818 --> 00:17:04,042
Ah, man, squishes are very tough, there we go!

636
00:17:04,042 --> 00:17:05,583
All right, gonna add the straws in next.

637
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:08,214
Dude, my slime is so good, I'm so excited about this.

638
00:17:08,214 --> 00:17:09,817
- All right, I need something to mix it up with.

639
00:17:09,817 --> 00:17:11,394
- You wanna use your hands?

640
00:17:11,394 --> 00:17:12,460
- No, not at all.

641
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,418
- You know Devan, I'm feeling generous.

642
00:17:13,418 --> 00:17:15,327
You can use my lacrosse stick to mix it up if you want.

643
00:17:15,327 --> 00:17:17,762
- I don't want that thing, dude, what is on my foot?

644
00:17:17,762 --> 00:17:19,633
It just feels like there's just so much.

645
00:17:19,633 --> 00:17:21,250
- That's the issue with slime on your feet man,

646
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,791
it just like picks up everything bro.

647
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,298
Like it just picks up everything.

648
00:17:24,298 --> 00:17:25,737
- All right, I got a bat.

649
00:17:25,737 --> 00:17:26,570
- For what?

650
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:27,403
- To mix it, dude.

651
00:17:27,403 --> 00:17:28,953
- That's not gonna really mix it that much at all man.

652
00:17:28,953 --> 00:17:30,060
- What do you mean, yes it will.

653
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,494
- It's just gonna turn the bat purple,

654
00:17:31,494 --> 00:17:32,327
that's all you're doing.

655
00:17:32,327 --> 00:17:33,259
- Better the bat than my hand.

656
00:17:33,259 --> 00:17:35,407
- Time to add in the Sta-Flo and really mix up

657
00:17:35,407 --> 00:17:37,598
my too many ingredient slime, so here we go.

658
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:38,566
Oh, dude, wait, I should probably add like

659
00:17:38,566 --> 00:17:40,120
too much Sta-flo as well as kinda part

660
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,533
of the whole theme of this thing right now.

661
00:17:41,533 --> 00:17:43,596
- I feel like this video could be summarized by both

662
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:45,175

- Hyeyeah, okay, there we go.

666
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:51,441
It's more like soup than slime right now.

667
00:17:51,441 --> 00:17:52,274
- Whoa, dude!

668
00:17:52,274 --> 00:17:53,107

669
00:17:53,107 --> 00:17:55,029

Why is this so like powdery?

Oh it's all the cornstarch, bro!

682
00:18:18,161 --> 00:18:20,611
This is like the most amount of things ever in slime bro!

683
00:18:20,611 --> 00:18:21,444
(grunts)

684
00:18:21,444 --> 00:18:22,710
What is going on?

685
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,889
- All right, done with the bat, now it's time for the hands!

686
00:18:24,889 --> 00:18:25,874
- Oh dude, your hands are still

687
00:18:25,874 --> 00:18:27,099

688
00:18:27,099 --> 00:18:27,935

692
00:18:32,793 --> 00:18:33,626

693
00:18:33,626 --> 00:18:36,161

694
00:18:36,161 --> 00:18:37,619
Woo, I can play the drums!

695
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:39,505
(tapping)

696
00:18:39,505 --> 00:18:41,615
Ow, you know what we haven't really done yet, Devan?

697
00:18:41,615 --> 00:18:42,448
- What?

698
00:18:42,448 --> 00:18:43,926
- We haven't really mixed our mini pool slimes yet.

699
00:18:43,926 --> 00:18:45,088
That's gon' be intense.

700
00:18:45,088 --> 00:18:46,839
- All right well the moments time to transport

701
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:49,196
my too many ingredient slime into the pool

702
00:18:49,196 --> 00:18:51,887
and this might be even heavier than my $1000 slime bro.

703
00:18:51,887 --> 00:18:53,662
This is going to be out of control.

704
00:18:53,662 --> 00:18:55,890
- Mine is just so frozen bro.

705
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:57,167
- You know what, I can kinda fold it like a

706
00:18:57,167 --> 00:18:59,338
little mini taco, here we go, taco slime fold, here we go.

707
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:01,223
- Oh, it's spilling, it's leaking, it's leaking!

708
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:02,437
- Here we go, I was gonna go quickly but here we go,

709
00:19:02,437 --> 00:19:03,306
three, two, one, ah!

710
00:19:03,306 --> 00:19:05,256
- Oh, freak it, that's not good!

711
00:19:05,256 --> 00:19:07,245
- I'm trying my best, it's too much stuff, here we go.

712
00:19:07,245 --> 00:19:08,372
Let's move it over like this.

713
00:19:08,372 --> 00:19:09,205
- Okay.

714
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:12,546
- Oh no, it got on my leg and I broke it!

715
00:19:12,546 --> 00:19:14,658
I broke the bucket, dude, no no no, it's getting everywhere,

716
00:19:14,658 --> 00:19:19,658
bro, bro bro, this is so bad bro, no, it's not working, why?

717
00:19:20,544 --> 00:19:22,741
Do you see how much, oh, I just realized something.

718
00:19:22,741 --> 00:19:24,025
This is like perfect, do to one of my

719
00:19:24,025 --> 00:19:27,139
excellent placed yeets, there's actually a bucket top,

720
00:19:27,139 --> 00:19:29,290
that actually held most of it, yes, dude.

721
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:31,512
Craziest plot twist of 2019 so far.

722
00:19:31,512 --> 00:19:32,397
- What?

723
00:19:32,397 --> 00:19:33,934
Dude, this is perfect. (coughs)

724
00:19:33,934 --> 00:19:34,774
You okay?

725
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:35,607
- Whew!

726
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:37,279
- All right well that right there that's enough off the top.

727
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:38,756
All right now we got to mix the rest in by hand

728
00:19:38,756 --> 00:19:39,772
and then mix up the whole thing.

729
00:19:39,772 --> 00:19:41,435
This is gonna be some work.

730
00:19:41,435 --> 00:19:43,661
- I think mine's close enough, it's ready to add.

731
00:19:43,661 --> 00:19:45,193
- I mean, how are you gonna pick that thing up bro?

732
00:19:45,193 --> 00:19:46,392
- That's so heavy.

733
00:19:46,392 --> 00:19:47,903
(grunts)

734
00:19:47,903 --> 00:19:48,986
- That's how!

735
00:19:48,986 --> 00:19:50,897
- Yo, he's like super strong, what?

736
00:19:50,897 --> 00:19:51,843
(grunts)

737
00:19:51,843 --> 00:19:53,622
- Dude, your slime like just like stuck.

738
00:19:53,622 --> 00:19:55,301
- It's so slippery, that's the only problem.

739
00:19:55,301 --> 00:19:57,111
- This boy needs some help!

740
00:19:57,111 --> 00:19:57,944
- What?

741
00:19:57,944 --> 00:19:59,014
- I must help, I don't know what this is doing

742
00:19:59,014 --> 00:20:01,849
but I think it's helping, lift.

743
00:20:01,849 --> 00:20:03,651
- Dude, this is so difficult, yes!

744
00:20:03,651 --> 00:20:05,070
- You nailed it bro, so all right Devan's got--

745
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:05,903
- Yeet! - His slime in.

746
00:20:05,903 --> 00:20:07,065
- I've got a sponge on my foot.

747
00:20:07,065 --> 00:20:08,372
- All right Devan you've got your slime in,

748
00:20:08,372 --> 00:20:09,869
I've got my slime in and right now,

749
00:20:09,869 --> 00:20:10,797
we're gonna pop our feet in

750
00:20:10,797 --> 00:20:11,795
and we're gonna mix it all around.

751
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:14,413
All right, here we go, three, two, one!

752
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:15,413
- [Both] Oh!

753
00:20:16,746 --> 00:20:18,061
- [Both] Oh!

754
00:20:18,061 --> 00:20:20,890
- Let's get in here and let's just mix up a little bit.

755
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:23,052
- This is like a leg workout, this is for reals.

756
00:20:23,052 --> 00:20:24,168
- I got to use my lacrosse stick.

757
00:20:24,168 --> 00:20:25,188
- My socks!

758
00:20:25,188 --> 00:20:26,338
- Wait, I'm like legit stuck.

759
00:20:26,338 --> 00:20:27,171
(yells)

760
00:20:27,171 --> 00:20:28,595
I will not have socks at the end of this, you are right,

761
00:20:28,595 --> 00:20:29,428
all right. (yells)

762
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:31,269
Are you okay?

763
00:20:31,269 --> 00:20:32,690
- No, no, no.

764
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:33,648
- All right, let's see.

765
00:20:33,648 --> 00:20:34,613
(laughs)

766
00:20:34,613 --> 00:20:35,505
- This is a weird feeling.

767
00:20:35,505 --> 00:20:38,588
- Ah, bro I'm like legit, no working!

768
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:41,785
- It feels like mud, but stickier.

769
00:20:41,785 --> 00:20:43,822
I will never be able to wear these socks again.

770
00:20:43,822 --> 00:20:45,224
These socks are so stretched.

771
00:20:45,224 --> 00:20:46,615
- I can't get my feet out of this thing bro.

772
00:20:46,615 --> 00:20:48,512
You're at least moving bro, I can't even move,

773
00:20:48,512 --> 00:20:50,924
I'm like fully stuck right now man, this is not good.

774
00:20:50,924 --> 00:20:52,115
This is not quite working Devan.

775
00:20:52,115 --> 00:20:53,477
I think we gotta find another way to mix it up.

776
00:20:53,477 --> 00:20:54,856
- I think I heard my pants rip.

777
00:20:54,856 --> 00:20:56,154
- Lift it like this and mix it like this.

778
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:58,779
- Can't lose balance, I just need to get these socks off.

779
00:20:58,779 --> 00:21:02,002
Yes, one sock is off, this this is legit my sock.

780
00:21:02,002 --> 00:21:04,596
This is how long it got, it used to fit on my foot.

781
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:07,148
- Let's play dodge slime, dodge the slime.

782
00:21:07,148 --> 00:21:07,981
Whoa, dodge the slime, ah!

783
00:21:07,981 --> 00:21:10,648
(cross talking)

784
00:21:11,543 --> 00:21:13,515
At least you, I can't turn, I'm fully stuck, ow!

785
00:21:13,515 --> 00:21:14,632
- I got you fam.

786
00:21:14,632 --> 00:21:15,632
- [Both] Oh!

787
00:21:16,715 --> 00:21:17,548
- Ow!

788
00:21:18,673 --> 00:21:20,131
You got my leg!

789
00:21:20,131 --> 00:21:21,086
Oh dude, I have an idea,

790
00:21:21,086 --> 00:21:23,197
why don't we do a mystery wheel of what we should do next?

791
00:21:23,197 --> 00:21:24,030
- All right, I'm down.

792
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:24,878
Where is the mystery wheel?

793
00:21:24,878 --> 00:21:27,001
- Behind the duck, it's always behind the duck Devan.

794
00:21:27,001 --> 00:21:27,834
Tada!

795
00:21:27,834 --> 00:21:29,337
- I was gonna grab it too but all right, you ready?

796
00:21:29,337 --> 00:21:30,292
- All right, so let's spin right now

797
00:21:30,292 --> 00:21:31,321
and let's see what it delivers us.

798
00:21:31,321 --> 00:21:33,165
- Three, two, one!

799
00:21:33,165 --> 00:21:33,998
- That was a solid spin,

800
00:21:33,998 --> 00:21:35,398
this is our first ever midair mystery wheel spin.

801
00:21:35,398 --> 00:21:36,456
- I know right? - All right, so we got,

802
00:21:36,456 --> 00:21:38,037
we almost got green, which would have been slime,

803
00:21:38,037 --> 00:21:39,216
so let's see what it says.

804
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:40,825
- What's combine both pools?

805
00:21:40,825 --> 00:21:41,952
- Oh!

806
00:21:41,952 --> 00:21:42,785
- All right then!

807
00:21:42,785 --> 00:21:43,818
- Before we combine both of these,

808
00:21:43,818 --> 00:21:44,705
you get to comment down below

809
00:21:44,705 --> 00:21:46,656
who made a crazier slime?

810
00:21:46,656 --> 00:21:47,548
All right, well first up,

811
00:21:47,548 --> 00:21:48,944
we gotta move your pool closer to mine.

812
00:21:48,944 --> 00:21:51,008
- Why don't you have to move yours closer to mine?

813
00:21:51,008 --> 00:21:52,536
- Because, dude, you wanna try moving mine?

814
00:21:52,536 --> 00:21:55,612
Try moving mine, try to give it a pull.

815
00:21:55,612 --> 00:21:57,003
- Shout out to the train, by the way.

816
00:21:57,003 --> 00:21:58,388
- Aye! - Ah!

817
00:21:58,388 --> 00:22:00,737
- See! - Yeah, there's no way.

818
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:01,996
- You push from that side, I'll pull from this side.

819
00:22:01,996 --> 00:22:03,329
- At the same time.

820
00:22:03,329 --> 00:22:04,162
Three, two, one!

821
00:22:04,162 --> 00:22:04,995
Go for it!

822
00:22:04,995 --> 00:22:05,828
- [Both] Oh!

823
00:22:05,828 --> 00:22:07,188
- It worked, team work, it worked!

824
00:22:07,188 --> 00:22:08,423
- Keep going, keep going, keep going!

825
00:22:08,423 --> 00:22:09,382
- I got it, I got it, I got it.

826
00:22:09,382 --> 00:22:10,767
- All right, here we go gotta mix it.

827
00:22:10,767 --> 00:22:11,600
- Ready?

828
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,576
- Ah!

829
00:22:12,576 --> 00:22:14,325
- That's the sriracha one, right there.

830
00:22:14,325 --> 00:22:15,325
It's an egg!

831
00:22:16,712 --> 00:22:21,647
- An egg, that reminds me, I have an egg in my pocket!

832
00:22:21,647 --> 00:22:23,314
- You're kidding me!

833
00:22:24,424 --> 00:22:25,501
- Dude! - Whew!

834
00:22:25,501 --> 00:22:27,173
- How are we gonna mix the rest of these?

835
00:22:27,173 --> 00:22:29,384
- The issue is, it is so lame but as you guys can see,

836
00:22:29,384 --> 00:22:31,637
we clearly were ready to make every single slime

837
00:22:31,637 --> 00:22:32,470
we we've ever made.

838
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:34,457
Got so many buckets but it's getting super late right now

839
00:22:34,457 --> 00:22:36,329
and literally it's about to rain.

840
00:22:36,329 --> 00:22:37,654
So we won't be able to finish this tonight,

841
00:22:37,654 --> 00:22:38,640
it was a huge bummer.

842
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,199
But if you do wanna see us finish this up,

843
00:22:40,199 --> 00:22:42,082
just comment down below part two!

844
00:22:42,082 --> 00:22:43,284
Let's just dump all this in, you ready?

845
00:22:43,284 --> 00:22:44,318
- Easier said than done.

846
00:22:44,318 --> 00:22:45,556
- All right, here we go, you ready?

847
00:22:45,556 --> 00:22:47,806
Smells like sriracha sauce!

848
00:22:50,117 --> 00:22:51,705
Here we go and in!

849
00:22:51,705 --> 00:22:52,671
Here we go all right.

850
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:53,944
- That actually worked.

851
00:22:53,944 --> 00:22:56,444
- It's getting super slippery.

852
00:22:59,229 --> 00:23:01,574
- This is so difficult, whose idea was this?

853
00:23:01,574 --> 00:23:02,542
This is not gonna work.

854
00:23:02,542 --> 00:23:03,620
Oh, it's the bat!

855
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,453
- The bat?

856
00:23:04,453 --> 00:23:05,286
- I found the bat.

857
00:23:05,286 --> 00:23:06,119
- How is a bat gonna help us Devan?

858
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:07,327
- Dude, it's a mixer, bro.

859
00:23:07,327 --> 00:23:08,740
- No it's not, it's a bat. - Yes it is!

860
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,568
Look at this, you just pop it in there

861
00:23:10,568 --> 00:23:13,235
and then you just mix it around!

862
00:23:14,676 --> 00:23:15,509
- Nicely done!

863
00:23:15,509 --> 00:23:17,558
- Dude I gotta find another like bat or mixer!

864
00:23:17,558 --> 00:23:18,532
- Dude! - You're kidding me!

865
00:23:18,532 --> 00:23:19,365
- What was that!

866
00:23:19,365 --> 00:23:21,348
- Dude and it's getting worse bro, oh my gosh,

867
00:23:21,348 --> 00:23:24,146
my arm will not come out!

868
00:23:24,146 --> 00:23:25,756
- Oh my gosh dude!

869
00:23:25,756 --> 00:23:29,078
You're like a slime monster! - I know!

870
00:23:29,078 --> 00:23:29,911
- Dude!
