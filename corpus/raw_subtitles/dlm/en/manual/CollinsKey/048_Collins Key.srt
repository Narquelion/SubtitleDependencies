1
00:00:00,443 --> 00:00:04,105
♫ And you'll never wanna leave my side

2
00:00:04,105 --> 00:00:07,165
♫ As long as I don't break these

3
00:00:07,165 --> 00:00:08,803
♫ Promises

4
00:00:08,803 --> 00:00:12,882
♫ And they still feel all so wasted on myself

5
00:00:12,882 --> 00:00:13,976
- [Melanie] How do you do it?

6
00:00:13,976 --> 00:00:14,814
How do you do it?

7
00:00:14,814 --> 00:00:16,716
How do you bloody do it?

8
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:18,497
- [Howard] You're a terrific performer.

9
00:00:18,497 --> 00:00:22,080
17 years old. Let's remind America of that.

10
00:00:23,363 --> 00:00:24,334
- [Collins] And for the the trick

11
00:00:24,334 --> 00:00:25,780
I thought of-- - Whoa!

12
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,235
♫ And they still feel all so wasted on myself

13
00:00:28,235 --> 00:00:29,523
- [Collins] Now, what I'm about to do,

14
00:00:29,523 --> 00:00:32,577
most people say this is absolutely impossible.

15
00:00:32,577 --> 00:00:35,132
I want to make magic fun for my generation.

16
00:00:35,132 --> 00:00:37,404
Right now, open it up. Open up all those 20s.

17
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:38,429
- Oh my gosh.

18
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:40,620
- [Collins] Retweet if Collins Key blows your mind.

19
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,620
(people chattering)

20
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,273
(screams)

21
00:00:46,273 --> 00:00:47,653
♫ And they still feel all so wasted on myself

22
00:00:47,653 --> 00:00:51,403
(energetic electronic music)

23
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:01,101
- Mind blown! (energetic electronic music)

24
00:01:01,101 --> 00:01:03,285
- Right now, I need some of you to help me out.

25
00:01:03,285 --> 00:01:07,035
(energetic electronic music)

26
00:01:13,015 --> 00:01:16,962
- [Howie] I think that you are the new face of magic.

27
00:01:16,962 --> 00:01:20,502
You have just stepped into your future.

28
00:01:20,502 --> 00:01:23,585
(audience screaming)
