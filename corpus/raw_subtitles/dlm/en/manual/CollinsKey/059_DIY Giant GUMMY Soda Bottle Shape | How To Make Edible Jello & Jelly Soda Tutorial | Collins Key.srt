00:00:00,053 --> 00:00:01,223
- What's up, it's Collins Key,

2
00:00:01,223 --> 00:00:04,266
and for today's video, I am doing another DIY.

3
00:00:04,266 --> 00:00:06,760
Now I did my very first ever DIY last week,

4
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,096
and there was so much positive response on that video.

5
00:00:09,096 --> 00:00:09,929
I'm like, you know what,

6
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:11,462
we're gonna do another DIY right now.

7
00:00:11,462 --> 00:00:14,052
But this time, 'cause I'm kind of like a DIY master

8
00:00:14,052 --> 00:00:16,199
by this point, heh, come at me bro.

9
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:19,946
For this one I wanted to do a DIY jello soda.

10
00:00:19,946 --> 00:00:22,234
Basically how it works, I've got the soda all right here.

11
00:00:22,234 --> 00:00:24,288
I'm not gonna be DIY-ing every single one of these.

12
00:00:24,288 --> 00:00:25,157
I shouldn't shake it.

13
00:00:25,157 --> 00:00:27,086
And if you want me to do even more DIY videos,

14
00:00:27,086 --> 00:00:28,694
let me know by liking this video,

15
00:00:28,694 --> 00:00:30,920
and if this video gets enough thumbs up and enough support,

16
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,585
then I will do even more crazy DIY videos for you guys,

17
00:00:33,585 --> 00:00:34,944
and hopefully I won't fail.

18
00:00:34,944 --> 00:00:35,903
There's probably gonna be a lot of failing, though,

19
00:00:35,903 --> 00:00:36,780
if I do more of these. (chuckles)

20
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,455
This video was inspired by Awesome Disney Tours,

21
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:41,489
where he literally has done every single soda imaginable,

22
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:42,565
and turned it into jello.

23
00:00:42,565 --> 00:00:44,187
So make sure you guys go check out his channel,

24
00:00:44,187 --> 00:00:45,562
I'm gonna put the link down below.

25
00:00:45,562 --> 00:00:47,379
And I have to say a huge thank you,

26
00:00:47,379 --> 00:00:50,239
because we've hit one million subscribers

27
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:51,072
here on this channel.

28
00:00:51,072 --> 00:00:52,287
I was thinking about how we could possibly

29
00:00:52,287 --> 00:00:54,323
say thank you for all the support you guys give me.

30
00:00:54,323 --> 00:00:55,353
And so I came up with this idea,

31
00:00:55,353 --> 00:00:57,216
and I've actually partnered with Live.me,

32
00:00:57,216 --> 00:01:00,109
and I'm gonna be doing a live stream fan event.

33
00:01:00,109 --> 00:01:01,868
I just want to call and talk with,

34
00:01:01,868 --> 00:01:04,717
and get to know as many of you guys as I possibly can.

35
00:01:04,717 --> 00:01:05,598
It's gonna be so much fun.

36
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:07,558
There's gonna be magic also, there's gonna be dares,

37
00:01:07,558 --> 00:01:09,013
there's gonna be special guests, who knows.

38
00:01:09,013 --> 00:01:10,845
(coughs) Devin might be involved, you never know.

39
00:01:10,845 --> 00:01:12,494
This is happening on July 10th.

40
00:01:12,494 --> 00:01:14,124
And all you have to do if you want me to call you

41
00:01:14,124 --> 00:01:16,693
or FaceTime you, is just download the Live.me app.

42
00:01:16,693 --> 00:01:19,139
It's free, just use the link down in the description,

43
00:01:19,139 --> 00:01:20,555
that I way I know that you're one of my people.

44
00:01:20,555 --> 00:01:22,405
Also wanted to let you guys know it's a brand new month,

45
00:01:22,405 --> 00:01:23,939
and that means a brand new giveaway.

46
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:25,670
And this month I'm giving away a MacBook.

47
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:26,505
So if you guys want to win that,

48
00:01:26,505 --> 00:01:28,100
let me know by liking this video.

49
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,000
Comment down below,

50
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,705
what's your favorite video I've ever posted?

51
00:01:30,705 --> 00:01:32,025
Of course you must be subscribed to this channel.

52
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:34,260
I'll be announcing the winner of the June giveaway

53
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,373
at the end of this video, so stick around for that.

54
00:01:36,373 --> 00:01:37,925
But right now let's jump right in.

55
00:01:37,925 --> 00:01:40,677
Let's create some DIY. (glass clinking)

56
00:01:40,677 --> 00:01:44,039
Supposed to catch it on my hand, that did not go as planned.

57
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:46,523
Okay, let's get into the video.

58
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,473
All you need for this is of course the soda,

59
00:01:48,473 --> 00:01:51,641
you're also gonna need a ridiculous amount,

60
00:01:51,641 --> 00:01:53,344
a ridiculous amount of gelatin.

61
00:01:53,344 --> 00:01:54,784
Here we go, we'll get the shot.

62
00:01:54,784 --> 00:01:55,915
You're gonna need some bowls.

63
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:57,885
You're also going to need duct tape.

64
00:01:57,885 --> 00:01:59,533
And last but not least, of course...

65
00:01:59,533 --> 00:02:02,172
(dramatic tone)

66
00:02:02,172 --> 00:02:04,318
A knife. (laughs)

67
00:02:04,318 --> 00:02:05,978
Alright, so now you're just gonna take your soda,

68
00:02:05,978 --> 00:02:07,150
open it up. (pressure whistles)

69
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:10,352
Oh my gosh, it's like smoking right now.

70
00:02:10,352 --> 00:02:11,881
Alright, here we go, we got the soda,

71
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:13,554
and then we're just gonna pour it into the bowl.

72
00:02:13,554 --> 00:02:15,329
Hopefully they, I'm just splashing it everywhere.

73
00:02:15,329 --> 00:02:16,615
It's just like chugging out.

74
00:02:16,615 --> 00:02:18,347
Actually I'm gonna put the top in there.

75
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:20,528
(liquid sloshing)

76
00:02:20,528 --> 00:02:22,436
That's so much!

77
00:02:22,436 --> 00:02:24,240
Alright, well that is all the soda out of here,

78
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,559
and now it's time for step number two.

79
00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:28,804
Ah, I just drank that whole thing.

80
00:02:28,804 --> 00:02:29,654
Step number two, you just need

81
00:02:29,654 --> 00:02:31,411
to remove this label right here,

82
00:02:31,411 --> 00:02:33,382
that way you can put it on the finished product

83
00:02:33,382 --> 00:02:35,918
of the jello soda, so for this you need

84
00:02:35,918 --> 00:02:37,478
to be very careful to make sure you do not

85
00:02:37,478 --> 00:02:40,495
rip the label prematurely, just try it right now.

86
00:02:40,495 --> 00:02:43,270
Yeah, I'm pretty sure I messed this up.

87
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,486
There we go, now that you've

88
00:02:44,486 --> 00:02:48,023
perfectly removed the label from...

89
00:02:48,023 --> 00:02:49,346
Now that you have perfectly removed the label

90
00:02:49,346 --> 00:02:50,952
from the bottle, you're ready to continue

91
00:02:50,952 --> 00:02:52,583
on to step number three.

92
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:55,369
If I get this, this is going to be awesome.

93
00:02:55,369 --> 00:02:56,827
Oh, didn't get it! (laughs)

94
00:02:56,827 --> 00:02:58,953
For this next step, I was going to spin the bottle

95
00:02:58,953 --> 00:03:00,771
on the knife, but that did not work out at all.

96
00:03:00,771 --> 00:03:02,374
You're not actually gonna be using this giant knife,

97
00:03:02,374 --> 00:03:03,895
because that's not safe at all.

98
00:03:03,895 --> 00:03:06,051
If using a smaller bottle, you can use an X-ACTO knife.

99
00:03:06,051 --> 00:03:07,518
I've brought along a Leatherman knife

100
00:03:07,518 --> 00:03:09,880
because it's more hardcore because this is a bigger bottle.

101
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,031
Just gonna cut a line right here,

102
00:03:12,031 --> 00:03:13,171
and be very careful on this.

103
00:03:13,171 --> 00:03:14,923
Don't do this without parental supervision,

104
00:03:14,923 --> 00:03:16,026
because I don't want to get sued.

105
00:03:16,026 --> 00:03:16,909
This is how you do it.

106
00:03:16,909 --> 00:03:18,045
Hey look, it's my fingers.

107
00:03:18,045 --> 00:03:21,107
You're just gonna cut into this here.

108
00:03:21,107 --> 00:03:23,527
That's, and just try to cut a straight line.

109
00:03:23,527 --> 00:03:24,360
That's not straight at all,

110
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,677
that was the most jagged line I've ever,

111
00:03:25,677 --> 00:03:27,697
look how bad that is! (warning horn)

112
00:03:27,697 --> 00:03:28,781
Well, after you've cut

113
00:03:28,781 --> 00:03:30,477
a perfectly straight line on the bottle,

114
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:32,868
you are ready to continue, what step were we on?

115
00:03:32,868 --> 00:03:34,379
Five, step number five.

116
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:36,459
Whether or not it's five, we're going with step number five.

117
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:39,835
Step number five, duct tape, ow.

118
00:03:39,835 --> 00:03:40,668
So what you're gonna do for this

119
00:03:40,668 --> 00:03:45,048
is just take a strip of duct tape, tear it.

120
00:03:45,048 --> 00:03:46,349
Just like that, and then what you're gonna do

121
00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:48,656
is you're gonna take it, and you're gonna cover up

122
00:03:48,656 --> 00:03:50,322
the incision you just made.

123
00:03:50,322 --> 00:03:52,224
Cover that up, bam, just like that.

124
00:03:52,224 --> 00:03:55,700
And now you've officially air-tight sealed this thing.

125
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,977
Now we're moving onto step number six.

126
00:03:57,977 --> 00:03:59,574
I tried to do threes like that, but that didn't work.

127
00:03:59,574 --> 00:04:00,552
Alright, let's do it.

128
00:04:00,552 --> 00:04:02,415
The original recipe calls for eight packs of jello,

129
00:04:02,415 --> 00:04:03,954
but this one, since we're super-sizing it,

130
00:04:03,954 --> 00:04:06,215
I'm going to be using 26 packs of jello.

131
00:04:06,215 --> 00:04:07,691
So, let's do it right now.

132
00:04:07,691 --> 00:04:09,676
Instead of being basic and doing one at a time,

133
00:04:09,676 --> 00:04:11,698
I'm going to do all of them at once!

134
00:04:11,698 --> 00:04:16,389
About to rip through 26 jello packets at once, legendary.

135
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:19,056
(paper ripping)

136
00:04:23,284 --> 00:04:25,246
Okay, I'm gonna go back to doing one at a time.

137
00:04:25,246 --> 00:04:28,586
(lively music)

138
00:04:28,586 --> 00:04:31,356
Next you're going to just add water,

139
00:04:31,356 --> 00:04:34,064
and then microwave it for about three minutes give or take,

140
00:04:34,064 --> 00:04:35,789
and we'll see what happens.

141
00:04:35,789 --> 00:04:37,577
- [Narrator] A few moments later.

142
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:38,410
(microwave beeps)

143
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,403
- How do you open the microwave?

144
00:04:40,403 --> 00:04:42,132
Is there a button?

145
00:04:42,132 --> 00:04:44,451
You don't know how much I microwave things.

146
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:45,597
How do you do this?

147
00:04:45,597 --> 00:04:48,530
Go timer, strike, stop, clear, clock, clear!

148
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:49,594
Nope, that's not it.

149
00:04:49,594 --> 00:04:51,145
How do, how do these work?

150
00:04:51,145 --> 00:04:53,657
So maybe if I pull it like this?

151
00:04:53,657 --> 00:04:55,197
Oh, I see the little button on the side,

152
00:04:55,197 --> 00:04:56,212
I must have like hit it by accident.

153
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:59,514
Oh my gosh, it looks disgusting, what the heck.

154
00:04:59,514 --> 00:05:01,830
Next, I need to stir this around a little bit.

155
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,118
Just gonna give it a little, oh,

156
00:05:03,118 --> 00:05:07,195
ho ho ho, oh my gosh, this looks so nasty!

157
00:05:07,195 --> 00:05:08,861
Now the part we've all been waiting for.

158
00:05:08,861 --> 00:05:13,131
You add the jello to the mix, so here we go,

159
00:05:13,131 --> 00:05:14,106
we're just gonna do this.

160
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:15,819
I'm not gonna even lie, this is one of the most

161
00:05:15,819 --> 00:05:20,395
disgusting things I've ever smelled in my entire life.

162
00:05:20,395 --> 00:05:22,041
Hoo, it is uck!

163
00:05:22,041 --> 00:05:23,758
Wait 'til YouTube introduces a feature

164
00:05:23,758 --> 00:05:25,422
where you can smell what I'm smelling right now,

165
00:05:25,422 --> 00:05:28,005
because this stuff is not nice.

166
00:05:28,946 --> 00:05:30,362
Ugh, it's so gross!

167
00:05:30,362 --> 00:05:32,010
Next we are going to be pouring all of this

168
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:34,629
into the empty duct taped bottle.

169
00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:37,909
Alright, I guess we're just gonna kind of go for it?

170
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:38,742
No, no!

171
00:05:40,653 --> 00:05:42,070
There we go, ooh!

172
00:05:44,908 --> 00:05:46,890
Now all you have to do is just freeze it and wait for

173
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:49,900
one hour, and at that point you'll have a jello soda.

174
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,936
All the bubbles will go away,

175
00:05:50,936 --> 00:05:52,388
so let's do that right now.

176
00:05:52,388 --> 00:05:53,808
- [Narrator] One hour later.

177
00:05:53,808 --> 00:05:55,308
- This is the big reveal right now.

178
00:05:55,308 --> 00:05:56,566
We're about to find out what this thing looks like.

179
00:05:56,566 --> 00:05:58,899
Here we go, three, two, one!

180
00:06:00,385 --> 00:06:02,993
(disappointed tone) (laughs)

181
00:06:02,993 --> 00:06:04,338
Bruh, what is that?

182
00:06:04,338 --> 00:06:06,858
Kinda cut open the bottle and then remove the jello,

183
00:06:06,858 --> 00:06:08,781
or the frozen mass of failure.

184
00:06:08,781 --> 00:06:10,090
This is just horrible.

185
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:13,533
Alright, here we go, let's see if I can do this.

186
00:06:13,533 --> 00:06:15,268
(laughs) Hey!

187
00:06:15,268 --> 00:06:18,185
Look at that, not too shabby, okay.

188
00:06:20,355 --> 00:06:22,438
(laughs)

189
00:06:25,598 --> 00:06:26,604
I don't know why that's so much fun.

190
00:06:26,604 --> 00:06:28,502
Alright, so now we have to get the other half out,

191
00:06:28,502 --> 00:06:32,002
so let me see if I flip this up like this.

192
00:06:33,386 --> 00:06:34,783
(laughs) It's not coming out.

193
00:06:34,783 --> 00:06:35,697
It's gonna crack in half.

194
00:06:35,697 --> 00:06:36,582
Let's see if I can get

195
00:06:36,582 --> 00:06:38,822
this whole thing out without it breaking.

196
00:06:38,822 --> 00:06:40,597
Be free! (laughs)

197
00:06:40,597 --> 00:06:41,847
It didn't work.

198
00:06:43,602 --> 00:06:45,519
Leave your bottle, yay!

199
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:48,154
We did it!

200
00:06:48,154 --> 00:06:49,387
Even though it's chunky, it's funky,

201
00:06:49,387 --> 00:06:51,425
it's messed up, we did it!

202
00:06:51,425 --> 00:06:52,765
So what you do is you take the top now,

203
00:06:52,765 --> 00:06:55,345
gonna put the top on there.

204
00:06:55,345 --> 00:06:56,295
It's coming together!

205
00:06:56,295 --> 00:06:58,971
Now you just take this, oh my gosh,

206
00:06:58,971 --> 00:07:01,011
this low-key like actually works.

207
00:07:01,011 --> 00:07:02,534
And bam, there you have it.

208
00:07:02,534 --> 00:07:04,784
This is the DIY jello soda.

209
00:07:05,784 --> 00:07:06,770
So I don't know what I did wrong,

210
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,402
probably the fact that it was so big.

211
00:07:08,402 --> 00:07:12,996
(smack reverberates) (laughs)

212
00:07:12,996 --> 00:07:14,413
It looks so cool!

213
00:07:15,567 --> 00:07:18,424
Well it kind of failed at the end there, but.

214
00:07:18,424 --> 00:07:20,059
Ah, it's cold.

215
00:07:20,059 --> 00:07:23,445
I'm gonna take my jello with me, my little baby.

216
00:07:23,445 --> 00:07:24,278
I'm gonna try and bite

217
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:27,695
the frost-bitten part right now, hold on.

218
00:07:30,411 --> 00:07:34,494
It's so cold, okay, bye. (laughs)

219
00:07:35,606 --> 00:07:37,523
Help, it's gross, okay.
