1
00:00:00,266 --> 00:00:02,559
- What's up, it's Collins Key and today I'm back

2
00:00:02,559 --> 00:00:04,272
for another super-sour challenge

3
00:00:04,272 --> 00:00:05,701
and there's a twist on this one,

4
00:00:05,701 --> 00:00:06,696
but, first, I need someone to help me out,

5
00:00:06,696 --> 00:00:08,892
so, everyone, please welcome my brother, Devin.

6
00:00:08,892 --> 00:00:09,992
Hey! - Hey!

7
00:00:09,992 --> 00:00:11,789
Whoa, this is ginormous!

8
00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:12,686
- Huh?

9
00:00:12,686 --> 00:00:14,318
So, as you guys can tell, we've got some giant candy

10
00:00:14,318 --> 00:00:15,581
here, these are actually lollypops, they're not

11
00:00:15,581 --> 00:00:16,681
maracas, but before we...

12
00:00:16,681 --> 00:00:18,431
Oh, I dropped it, no!

13
00:00:19,779 --> 00:00:21,818
- Why would you do that?

14
00:00:21,818 --> 00:00:23,329
- Ah, it's probably broken.

15
00:00:23,329 --> 00:00:25,045
I've ruined the video before it's even started,

16
00:00:25,045 --> 00:00:27,001
but we have a challenge for you guys,

17
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:28,754
we want to see if you can subscribe to this channel

18
00:00:28,754 --> 00:00:31,080
and turn on the channel post notifications

19
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,689
in five seconds, that's all the time you have, here we go,

20
00:00:33,689 --> 00:00:36,522
five, four, three, two, one, done.

21
00:00:39,037 --> 00:00:40,095
If you were able to subscribe and turn

22
00:00:40,095 --> 00:00:42,055
on the channel post notifications in that amount of time,

23
00:00:42,055 --> 00:00:44,461
comment down below, "Keyper Squad," right now,

24
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,826
that way we know that you're like a subscribe ninja,

25
00:00:46,826 --> 00:00:48,050
that's a thing.

26
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:49,640
Can I have my lollypop back?

27
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,473
Oh my...

28
00:00:52,948 --> 00:00:55,439
Well, now that I'm still alive and I have my lollypop back,

29
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:56,909
I want to let you guys know that I'm giving away

30
00:00:56,909 --> 00:00:59,594
a drone on YouTube, an iPhone 7 on Instagram,

31
00:00:59,594 --> 00:01:01,059
a GoPro on Twitter,

32
00:01:01,059 --> 00:01:02,810
if you want to enter all these giveaways,

33
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:04,192
the rest of the rules of the giveaway are all down

34
00:01:04,192 --> 00:01:05,337
in the description below, so be sure to enter

35
00:01:05,337 --> 00:01:07,171
and Devin, I think we're gonna lose our taste buds

36
00:01:07,171 --> 00:01:08,965
for about a month after doing this video,

37
00:01:08,965 --> 00:01:11,248
so if you guys can give it a thumbs up for encouragement

38
00:01:11,248 --> 00:01:13,123
for the fact that we will not be able to taste food

39
00:01:13,123 --> 00:01:15,160
for an entire month, that would really mean a lot.

40
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,835
I'm going to try to explain this challenge as quickly

41
00:01:16,835 --> 00:01:17,811
as I possibly can.

42
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:19,894
Basically, we have giant candies right here,

43
00:01:19,894 --> 00:01:21,956
one person will close their eyes, the other person

44
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:23,582
will feed them a candy.

45
00:01:23,582 --> 00:01:26,356
If they guess wrong, they have eat a super sour candy,

46
00:01:26,356 --> 00:01:28,561
but if they guess right, the other person has to eat

47
00:01:28,561 --> 00:01:30,924
a super sour candy and at the very end,

48
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:34,109
one of us is going to be eating the world's largest

49
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:36,183
sour candy, so make sure you guys stick around for that,

50
00:01:36,183 --> 00:01:38,263
but right now, without any further ado, let's jump in

51
00:01:38,263 --> 00:01:40,708
and let's get started, clink it.

52
00:01:40,708 --> 00:01:41,687
Oh jeez.

53
00:01:41,687 --> 00:01:43,276
To decide who goes first, we're going to do a very

54
00:01:43,276 --> 00:01:44,948
quick game of rock paper scissors,

55
00:01:44,948 --> 00:01:45,781
so here we go,

56
00:01:45,781 --> 00:01:48,373
Rock paper scissors shoot! - Rock paper scissors shoot!

57
00:01:48,373 --> 00:01:49,206
- Oh man!

58
00:01:50,373 --> 00:01:52,655
So, Devin, you get to choose what candy you want

59
00:01:52,655 --> 00:01:55,106
to use first and here we go.

60
00:01:55,106 --> 00:01:56,655
So Devin's gonna go pick out his candy right now

61
00:01:56,655 --> 00:01:58,245
and I'm realizing, I'm going to be able to hear him

62
00:01:58,245 --> 00:01:59,709
as he's unwrapping it, which I think will kind of

63
00:01:59,709 --> 00:02:01,544
give it away, so I'm going to close my eyes

64
00:02:01,544 --> 00:02:02,891
and I'm gonna put on these headphones,

65
00:02:02,891 --> 00:02:04,932
that way I can't hear anything, here we go,

66
00:02:04,932 --> 00:02:06,319
I'm not using this as a blindfold

67
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:08,275
I'm just closing my eyes, and this is like the extra

68
00:02:08,275 --> 00:02:09,910
step to make sure I can't do anything,

69
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,091
so, alright there we go,

70
00:02:11,091 --> 00:02:12,475
please don't smack me in the face with a giant lollypop

71
00:02:12,475 --> 00:02:13,412
'cause that would hurt.

72
00:02:13,412 --> 00:02:15,005
- Alright, we have the first one right here,

73
00:02:15,005 --> 00:02:16,555
can't see anything, right, right?

74
00:02:16,555 --> 00:02:18,228
No, okay we good.

75
00:02:18,228 --> 00:02:19,692
- I can't hear you, did you say something?

76
00:02:19,692 --> 00:02:21,119
- What?

77
00:02:21,119 --> 00:02:23,583
Ooh, look at that, that is insane.

78
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:25,888
Just take a huge bite.

79
00:02:25,888 --> 00:02:28,561
What do you think it is?

80
00:02:28,561 --> 00:02:30,394
- It's chocolate coin!

81
00:02:32,808 --> 00:02:34,929
(talking with mouth full)

82
00:02:34,929 --> 00:02:37,179
- You ate some of his hair.

83
00:02:39,157 --> 00:02:40,990
- So, since Devin lost, I get to choose a sour candy

84
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:42,740
from the bag of pain.

85
00:02:45,839 --> 00:02:47,552
- Oh, that sounds painful.

86
00:02:47,552 --> 00:02:49,223
- So, we're kicking off with some good stuff,

87
00:02:49,223 --> 00:02:52,201
we're gonna do some Toxic Waste.

88
00:02:52,201 --> 00:02:54,776
- No, that stuff is so bad!

89
00:02:54,776 --> 00:02:56,044
- So, here you go Devin,

90
00:02:56,044 --> 00:02:57,107
oh, it's just a regular sized candy,

91
00:02:57,107 --> 00:02:58,413
alright, well, Devin, you have to take out a handful

92
00:02:58,413 --> 00:03:00,490
of them, not just one, a handful,

93
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:03,180
this is a huge candy video, you can't go for a little bit!

94
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,528
Our thoughts and prayers are with you

95
00:03:04,528 --> 00:03:05,995
in this difficult time.

96
00:03:05,995 --> 00:03:10,607
- This is so many of them, my mouth is watering already.

97
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,774
(wailing)

98
00:03:15,223 --> 00:03:17,223
- Bro, oh my gosh, dude.

99
00:03:26,562 --> 00:03:27,939
- Woah!

100
00:03:27,939 --> 00:03:30,387
- And on that note, we're moving on to round number two.

101
00:03:30,387 --> 00:03:32,630
- I'd better win this round.

102
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,057
- Alright, Devin, now it is your time for the

103
00:03:34,057 --> 00:03:35,408
headphones of silence.

104
00:03:35,408 --> 00:03:37,449
- I have to say, my taste buds are kind of damaged,

105
00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:38,918
I don't know how I'm gonna do this.

106
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:39,751
- Yes.

107
00:03:39,751 --> 00:03:41,565
There's one more thing I want to let you guys know

108
00:03:41,565 --> 00:03:43,892
about, Devin, Devin, sorry, bro.

109
00:03:43,892 --> 00:03:45,651
One more thing that Devin doesn't even know about

110
00:03:45,651 --> 00:03:47,977
is that this right here is the necklace of shame,

111
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:50,665
it is the largest sour candy necklace in the entire world

112
00:03:50,665 --> 00:03:52,092
and what's gonna happen here,

113
00:03:52,092 --> 00:03:54,211
Devin is losing this challenge, so he's gonna put it on.

114
00:03:54,211 --> 00:03:55,044
- What's happening?

115
00:03:55,044 --> 00:03:57,021
- Nothing, just, you're good, just don't even worry

116
00:03:57,021 --> 00:04:01,016
about it and, hey, close your eyes, no cheating,

117
00:04:01,016 --> 00:04:03,629
alright, guys, so this is my item right here,

118
00:04:03,629 --> 00:04:05,378
I don't think he's gonna be able to guess this one,

119
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:06,847
I don't really even know too much about this item,

120
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:08,764
so here we go, let's...

121
00:04:09,906 --> 00:04:10,843
What?

122
00:04:10,843 --> 00:04:12,921
I'm very disappointed right now, look at this,

123
00:04:12,921 --> 00:04:16,338
like I thought it was gonna be massive...

124
00:04:18,271 --> 00:04:19,104
- What just happened?

125
00:04:19,104 --> 00:04:21,448
- I just got ripped off, that's what just happened,

126
00:04:21,448 --> 00:04:23,077
I thought it was gonna be a huge one,

127
00:04:23,077 --> 00:04:24,709
this is ridiculous.

128
00:04:24,709 --> 00:04:27,076
- Whoa, what just happened?

129
00:04:27,076 --> 00:04:28,543
- Well, yee!

130
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:31,520
- A bunch of stuff just hit me.

131
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,336
- I'm so disappointed, guys, alright.

132
00:04:34,336 --> 00:04:36,419
Like tilt your head back.

133
00:04:39,964 --> 00:04:41,800
- Wow, this is tasty.

134
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,313
- Well, yeah, 'cause it's not sour.

135
00:04:43,313 --> 00:04:44,146
- Huh.

136
00:04:46,905 --> 00:04:49,314
Very sweet, bro, I have no idea.

137
00:04:49,314 --> 00:04:50,549
- Well, you had the first part of it,

138
00:04:50,549 --> 00:04:51,763
it's a Sweet Tart, and I thought they were gonna be

139
00:04:51,763 --> 00:04:54,545
massive, but look at this, this is such a ripoff, bro.

140
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:56,993
It's like a whole bunch of little ones in a big one.

141
00:04:56,993 --> 00:04:59,660
Never judge a book by its cover.

142
00:05:00,498 --> 00:05:02,135
- Wait, do I have to do more sour stuff?

143
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,279
- Yup, sorry, bro.

144
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:06,501
Alright, here we go, pass me the bag of pain, please.

145
00:05:06,501 --> 00:05:08,258
So, I went kind of hard on the last one,

146
00:05:08,258 --> 00:05:09,888
so this one I'm gonna go a lot easier,

147
00:05:09,888 --> 00:05:12,789
so I'm just gonna go with some of these ones,

148
00:05:12,789 --> 00:05:14,295
the nice little Cry Babies.

149
00:05:14,295 --> 00:05:15,128
- What?

150
00:05:15,128 --> 00:05:17,596
- These ones are, by far, not the worst at all.

151
00:05:17,596 --> 00:05:19,024
Oh, Devin, in case you're wondering what the

152
00:05:19,024 --> 00:05:20,652
necklace is for, basically, whoever loses the most

153
00:05:20,652 --> 00:05:22,651
amount of rounds has to eat the necklace,

154
00:05:22,651 --> 00:05:23,878
and this is like kinda how we keep track of

155
00:05:23,878 --> 00:05:25,306
who's losing this challenge right now,

156
00:05:25,306 --> 00:05:26,858
so you're wearing it.

157
00:05:26,858 --> 00:05:27,691
- Great.

158
00:05:37,304 --> 00:05:39,225
These are so bad!

159
00:05:39,225 --> 00:05:40,772
- Yeah, they're the worst!

160
00:05:40,772 --> 00:05:42,447
- I'm about to cry.

161
00:05:42,447 --> 00:05:44,197
- Yo, there's a literal tear.

162
00:05:44,197 --> 00:05:46,691
He's actually crying right now...

163
00:05:46,691 --> 00:05:48,730
Dude, your tongue, let me see it.

164
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:51,139
Oh, it looks pretty messed up.

165
00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:53,828
Alright, here we go, round number three, let's go.

166
00:05:53,828 --> 00:05:57,169
- I am really hoping that you mess up on this one

167
00:05:57,169 --> 00:05:58,435
and get it wrong.

168
00:05:58,435 --> 00:06:00,593
- Yup, these are the headphones of silence.

169
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:02,632
- Alright, here we go.

170
00:06:02,632 --> 00:06:06,215
- Nope, you've gotta stick your tongue out.

171
00:06:07,482 --> 00:06:08,649
- Okay, again.

172
00:06:11,276 --> 00:06:13,850
What, it tastes like a Hatchimal.

173
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:14,909
- What?

174
00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:17,070
- It like has the texture of a Hatchimal egg.

175
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,377
- How do you know what that tastes like?

176
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:19,925
- I don't know, it's just kind of like

177
00:06:19,925 --> 00:06:21,555
it's like a surprising taste,

178
00:06:21,555 --> 00:06:22,696
it's a Hatchimal!

179
00:06:22,696 --> 00:06:24,246
Is it a Hatchimal?

180
00:06:24,246 --> 00:06:25,713
It is?

181
00:06:25,713 --> 00:06:27,423
- No, it's a Jawbreaker.

182
00:06:27,423 --> 00:06:28,890
- I thought it was a Hatchimal.

183
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:29,723
- This is massive.

184
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:30,967
- No, that's a face-breaker, that will break

185
00:06:30,967 --> 00:06:33,600
your whole face, okay?

186
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,652
Holy cow.

187
00:06:34,652 --> 00:06:36,319
- Now, it's my turn.

188
00:06:37,795 --> 00:06:40,545
Oh, some toxic waste, Smog Balls!

189
00:06:42,115 --> 00:06:45,115
- These are the worst, I hate these.

190
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:51,942
(talking with mouth full)

191
00:06:51,942 --> 00:06:54,072
- You gotta chew 'em, bro.

192
00:06:54,072 --> 00:06:56,872
Bro, I left mine in for a while.

193
00:06:56,872 --> 00:07:00,130
Dude, your teeth are yellow and green!

194
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:03,726
Okay, don't actually break your teeth.

195
00:07:03,726 --> 00:07:06,013
(whimpering)

196
00:07:06,013 --> 00:07:07,846
Yes, some retribution!

197
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:11,030
Bro, that is really bad.

198
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:13,513
- Are my teeth bad?

199
00:07:13,513 --> 00:07:14,979
- Yes. - What?

200
00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:16,201
- Those are really bad.

201
00:07:16,201 --> 00:07:17,828
- No!

202
00:07:17,828 --> 00:07:20,887
I have to brush my teeth, and we will proceed

203
00:07:20,887 --> 00:07:23,250
on to round number four.

204
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,879
You're still losing the most, so you still got

205
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:26,703
that nasty necklace on, but, let's do it

206
00:07:26,703 --> 00:07:28,634
Take the headphones of silence.

207
00:07:28,634 --> 00:07:30,278
- I thought you were gonna throw them at me.

208
00:07:30,278 --> 00:07:34,197
- Yo, this thing is huge, oh my gosh, look at it,

209
00:07:34,197 --> 00:07:36,645
it's taller than Devin's head,

210
00:07:36,645 --> 00:07:39,254
I gotta give 'em credit, man, they do not

211
00:07:39,254 --> 00:07:40,254
play around.

212
00:07:41,581 --> 00:07:43,664
Take a bite, take a bite.

213
00:07:44,761 --> 00:07:46,928
Just keep your head still!

214
00:07:48,464 --> 00:07:50,220
- This is familiar.

215
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,259
Wait, bro, is this a Snickers bar?

216
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:53,807
- Oh no!

217
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,561
- Yeah, did I get it, did I get it?

218
00:07:55,561 --> 00:07:56,743
- You got it.

219
00:07:56,743 --> 00:07:58,375
- Alright, I am so happy right now,

220
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:01,148
wait, does this mean that you wear the necklace?

221
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:02,984
- Well, no, we're tied, so like...

222
00:08:02,984 --> 00:08:05,638
- I think you wear the necklace.

223
00:08:05,638 --> 00:08:08,166
You are currently... - No!

224
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:10,981
- Just hang it over your ears.

225
00:08:10,981 --> 00:08:13,263
Sour Farts candy, what?

226
00:08:13,263 --> 00:08:14,281
- What, no!

227
00:08:14,281 --> 00:08:15,218
- Here you go.

228
00:08:15,218 --> 00:08:16,154
- Just dump it in again?

229
00:08:16,154 --> 00:08:17,987
- Of course. - Alright.

230
00:08:19,136 --> 00:08:21,095
- What does it smell like? - Potent.

231
00:08:21,095 --> 00:08:23,419
Alright, here we go.

232
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:26,373
(talking with mouth full)

233
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:27,496
- What, is it that bad?

234
00:08:27,496 --> 00:08:29,079
- Oh yeah! - Really?

235
00:08:35,493 --> 00:08:36,921
Wait, let's see your tongue.

236
00:08:36,921 --> 00:08:39,700
Ha, it's so many different colors, it's crazy.

237
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,617
- Next round, let's go.

238
00:08:44,593 --> 00:08:46,926
Ow, you just kicked me, bro.

239
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:50,674
- Oh, that smells good.

240
00:08:50,674 --> 00:08:52,875
- Can I smell it?

241
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,180
I just wanna smell it, okay?

242
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,731
Totally stick it in my face.

243
00:08:55,731 --> 00:08:57,278
Can you be gentle, please, Devin?

244
00:08:57,278 --> 00:08:59,072
Can I ask for you to be gentle?

245
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:00,986
- It's in front, okay, there you go.

246
00:09:00,986 --> 00:09:02,417
- It's a lollypop.

247
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:03,600
- Yeah.

248
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,882
- Kinda helped when you hit me in the face.

249
00:09:06,882 --> 00:09:08,429
This thing is awesome, by the way.

250
00:09:08,429 --> 00:09:10,387
- I just can't imagine a little kid

251
00:09:10,387 --> 00:09:11,771
eating this whole thing.

252
00:09:11,771 --> 00:09:13,319
- It would take like a decade.

253
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:15,849
Not only do you get to experience the bag of pain again,

254
00:09:15,849 --> 00:09:17,681
but you are, right now, the current loser.

255
00:09:17,681 --> 00:09:19,356
- No, I forgot about this.

256
00:09:19,356 --> 00:09:21,435
- So, here you go, the necklace of shame,

257
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:23,145
oops, well I'll just leave it like that.

258
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,219
So, Devin keeps saying that the Warheads are not

259
00:09:24,219 --> 00:09:25,726
bad at all, and, so, if you think they're not

260
00:09:25,726 --> 00:09:29,726
so bad, we're gonna do some Warheads right here.

261
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:33,688
There you go.

262
00:09:33,688 --> 00:09:36,095
- Oh yeah, doesn't smell bad at all.

263
00:09:36,095 --> 00:09:37,644
- Here you go, and you have to chew these, too,

264
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:40,090
you made me chew those, like...

265
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:42,169
I had to chew the Smog Balls.

266
00:09:42,169 --> 00:09:44,336
You gotta chew these, bro.

267
00:09:47,633 --> 00:09:50,120
(talking with mouth full)

268
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,953
- Ow, ow.

269
00:09:54,479 --> 00:09:55,946
- What are you doing!

270
00:09:55,946 --> 00:09:57,373
You said these weren't bad at all, bro,

271
00:09:57,373 --> 00:10:00,224
what are you talking about.

272
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:01,057
You good?

273
00:10:01,895 --> 00:10:03,403
Alright, well Devin, officially, is about to

274
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:05,683
quit this challenge and so before he quit,

275
00:10:05,683 --> 00:10:07,844
we're moving on to the next round right now,

276
00:10:07,844 --> 00:10:08,844
let's do it.

277
00:10:12,293 --> 00:10:15,310
I wish that I got this one because these are

278
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:17,181
delicious, these giant candies are the best,

279
00:10:17,181 --> 00:10:19,787
so Devin doesn't know what I'm talking about.

280
00:10:19,787 --> 00:10:20,868
These are huge.

281
00:10:20,868 --> 00:10:21,884
- I smell something.

282
00:10:21,884 --> 00:10:22,928
Smells like chocolate.

283
00:10:22,928 --> 00:10:23,870
It's a York Peppermint Patty!

284
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:24,703
- A what?

285
00:10:24,703 --> 00:10:26,695
- It's a York Peppermint Patty, I could taste the mint,

286
00:10:26,695 --> 00:10:29,862
bro, this is delicious, ah, love this.

287
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:32,399
- Yeah, you got it, yeah.

288
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,316
I want to try it, bro, this looks so good.

289
00:10:34,316 --> 00:10:38,983
- It's like a breath mint and a candy bar mixed together.

290
00:10:38,983 --> 00:10:39,816
- I lost, though.

291
00:10:39,816 --> 00:10:41,229
- Woohoo! - No!

292
00:10:41,229 --> 00:10:43,346
- Not only do you get some sour candy,

293
00:10:43,346 --> 00:10:45,750
you're also getting the necklace back!

294
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,383
- No, you keep it on.

295
00:10:47,383 --> 00:10:48,811
- We're tied. - We're tied.

296
00:10:48,811 --> 00:10:50,603
There's no reason why I should have it on!

297
00:10:50,603 --> 00:10:52,805
There's no reason I should have it on in a tie.

298
00:10:52,805 --> 00:10:54,925
- Ooh, this looks kinda crazy, do this.

299
00:10:54,925 --> 00:10:55,758
Sour Power.

300
00:10:55,758 --> 00:10:56,898
- I don't think this is gonna be that bad,

301
00:10:56,898 --> 00:10:58,443
like I think this will be the best of them all.

302
00:10:58,443 --> 00:10:59,624
- Okay, well if you think that,

303
00:10:59,624 --> 00:11:01,050
I'm adding in these two as well,

304
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:02,029
so you can take these.

305
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:03,295
- That's like three candies at once!

306
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,884
- I'll even help you open them, I'm that kind.

307
00:11:04,884 --> 00:11:06,717
- This is going to be literally horrible.

308
00:11:06,717 --> 00:11:08,594
Alright, we're doing this and we have some of these,

309
00:11:08,594 --> 00:11:10,184
these ones, I remember, were horrible,

310
00:11:10,184 --> 00:11:12,141
the Sour Punches, they won't even come out

311
00:11:12,141 --> 00:11:13,078
they're so angry.

312
00:11:13,078 --> 00:11:16,745
Alright, here we go, going with these first.

313
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:24,082
(moaning)

314
00:11:26,891 --> 00:11:30,141
- Whoa, your breath smells really good.

315
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,527
- No problem at all.

316
00:11:37,527 --> 00:11:39,283
That was delicious. - This is great.

317
00:11:39,283 --> 00:11:40,872
Alright, on to the next one.

318
00:11:40,872 --> 00:11:42,434
- This is the round it all comes down to,

319
00:11:42,434 --> 00:11:45,044
the final round, whoever loses has to eat the

320
00:11:45,044 --> 00:11:47,340
sourest candy necklace in the entire world.

321
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,722
We're tied right now,

322
00:11:48,722 --> 00:11:50,460
so I don't think it's fair, I'm not gonna wear this,

323
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,641
you're not gonna wear this,

324
00:11:51,641 --> 00:11:53,475
we're just gonna hang it back here just like that,

325
00:11:53,475 --> 00:11:56,244
and whoever loses this has to eat that candy necklace.

326
00:11:56,244 --> 00:11:59,745
- Next up, we have this, but it's actually not

327
00:11:59,745 --> 00:12:02,631
gonna be this, it's actually gonna be these Sour Fart

328
00:12:02,631 --> 00:12:04,056
candies.

329
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:07,102
Okay, Collins, tilt your head up, okay, open your mouth.

330
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:07,935
- Ow!

331
00:12:16,725 --> 00:12:18,598
Not cool, I'm gonna close my eyes 'cause I wanna win this

332
00:12:18,598 --> 00:12:21,574
fair and square, but bro, not cool.

333
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:25,324
- Okay, this time, we're actually doing this.

334
00:12:28,418 --> 00:12:31,313
This is five pounds of chocolate.

335
00:12:31,313 --> 00:12:34,146
Alright, open your mouth, Collins.

336
00:12:42,479 --> 00:12:44,646
- Mm, it is a Hershey Bar.

337
00:12:46,347 --> 00:12:48,792
- No, I was so hoping you wouldn't be able to get it!

338
00:12:48,792 --> 00:12:50,301
- Yeah! - Really?

339
00:12:50,301 --> 00:12:51,728
- So, Devin lost the challenge, so you have to eat

340
00:12:51,728 --> 00:12:54,701
the necklace of shame, plus eat whatever's left

341
00:12:54,701 --> 00:12:56,284
in the bag of pain.

342
00:12:57,919 --> 00:12:59,994
So, here we go, Devin, get ready to enjoy all of this,

343
00:12:59,994 --> 00:13:01,625
in the meantime, guys, please give the video

344
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,297
a thumbs up for the fact that this seriously

345
00:13:03,297 --> 00:13:04,235
hurt a lot.

346
00:13:04,235 --> 00:13:07,685
You might want to try this first off.

347
00:13:07,685 --> 00:13:10,834
Here we go, pop one of these in there.

348
00:13:10,834 --> 00:13:11,667
(crying)

349
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:13,750
- That was instant death!

350
00:13:15,272 --> 00:13:17,107
- And then, also, we've got some a little bit of

351
00:13:17,107 --> 00:13:19,063
Sour Patch Kids, so Devin, here, open up your mouth

352
00:13:19,063 --> 00:13:19,920
right now.

353
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,875
- Wow, this one's terrible.

354
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:23,749
- And, also, if you guys translate these videos,

00:13:23,749 --> 00:13:27,916
you will get credit in the description of these videos,

356
00:13:28,922 --> 00:13:30,287
so make sure you guys do that, that would really mean

357
00:13:30,287 --> 00:13:33,016
a lot, translate these videos into whatever

358
00:13:33,016 --> 00:13:35,262

00:13:35,262 --> 00:13:38,241
last thing, open your mouth.

00:13:38,241 --> 00:13:39,910
Some Sour Skittles!

361
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,931
But, of course you have to eat your necklace, though,

you gotta eat your necklace,

363
00:13:43,091 --> 00:13:44,537
