1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,170
- You challenged us to make Shazam, so let's go.

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:03,353
Now, I'm kicking it off with the lightning bolt first.

3
00:00:03,353 --> 00:00:05,460
Because the lightning bolt is the body,

4
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:06,527
but the lightning bolt is not the body.

5
00:00:06,527 --> 00:00:07,960
- Now we're gonna give him his little eyes.

6
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,130
And dude, his head is nowhere near as big

7
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:10,963
as his smile

8
00:00:10,963 --> 00:00:12,030
Yeah! - Yeah!

9
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:12,863
We'll give him his little mouth,

10
00:00:12,863 --> 00:00:14,817
he'll have a big ol' smile, like, yeah!

11
00:00:14,817 --> 00:00:16,190
Oh no!

12
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,023
I'm upset!

13
00:00:17,023 --> 00:00:17,856
- Whoa! - I'm sorry,

14
00:00:17,856 --> 00:00:18,689
- Bumps.

15
00:00:18,689 --> 00:00:19,522
- I'm doing my best, I'm sorry,

16
00:00:19,522 --> 00:00:21,350
I just lost control for a moment.

17
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:23,220
Uh-oh, I got a feeling this one might not come out right.

18
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,709
Gotta test this one over here first, let see.

19
00:00:24,709 --> 00:00:25,542
(dramatic music)

20
00:00:25,542 --> 00:00:26,375
(both screaming)

21
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:27,208
Oh, what?

22
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:28,664
I screamed so loud.

23
00:00:28,664 --> 00:00:29,497
(both screaming)

24
00:00:29,497 --> 00:00:30,760
I got it all over my wrist.

25
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,810
Well, gotta get this off my arm quick

26
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:32,920
before it stains my arm blue.

27
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,984
Gonna have a little bit of pinkeye over here in this eye,

28
00:00:34,984 --> 00:00:35,980
you know, you got a little bit of the eye infection,

29
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,338
doing whatever Shazam does.

30
00:00:37,338 --> 00:00:41,320
(peppy ukulele music)

31
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,660
We gotta give him defined muscles here,

32
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,250
got a little bicep, little tricep, appendix.

33
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,365
And of course a spleen, there we go.

34
00:00:46,365 --> 00:00:47,704
I think those areall the muscles that are in the arm.

35
00:00:47,704 --> 00:00:48,537
- What?

36
00:00:48,537 --> 00:00:49,370
(laughs)

37
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:50,536
All right, goin' for the armpits next,

38
00:00:50,536 --> 00:00:52,073
then I'm working on the bicep after that.

39
00:00:52,073 --> 00:00:55,410
All right, now goin' around, grabbing the elbow.

40
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,220
- [Collins] As you do that, I'm gonna add a elbow to mine.

41
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,410
- Comin' around to his forearm,

42
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,630
he's got these cool bracelet arm thingies.

43
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:01,530
- Next up, we gotta give a nice,

44
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:02,853
flowing white cape, so here we go.

45
00:01:02,853 --> 00:01:03,990
Just gonna give him a nice little cape like this.

46
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:05,620
Here we go, this whole area

47
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:06,810
is going to be the cape, you know?

48
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,520
Here we go, his cape goes all the way over here.

49
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,690
- [Devan] That's an expansive cape, Collins.

50
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:12,320
- It is absolutely an expansive cape for an expansive man.

51
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,440
You know what, if we're doing the cape,

52
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,480
we're doing the cape, man.

53
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,710
The cape comes all the way down here,

54
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,310
and this Shazam takes up the whole thing,

55
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,143
because Shazam is a big man.

56
00:01:18,143 --> 00:01:18,976
(Devan yells)

57
00:01:18,976 --> 00:01:19,809
- Ya bump.

58
00:01:19,809 --> 00:01:20,642
- I'm sorry. - Ya bump!

59
00:01:20,642 --> 00:01:22,880
- I'm sorry, yours is looking so cool, man, wow.

60
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,590
You look over here, it kinda looks like a frog.

61
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:25,423
- [Devan] All right, just doing

62
00:01:25,423 --> 00:01:26,410
the other side of his chest now.

63
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:28,010
- Now it's time to fill in his suit, so here we go,

64
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:29,520
we got the red goin' in, and this should be

65
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,610
the finishing touch for him.

66
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:32,310
My pancake is done, now gotta let it roast

67
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:34,120
as Devan meticulously finishes up his.

68
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,150
- [Devan] Now I'm adding the shadow under the armpits.

69
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,097
- Man, you are really into his armpits, man.

70
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:41,264
(peppy ukulele music)

71
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,300
Gonna begin lifting it off the griddle

72
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,010
and man, I'm actually shocked it's staying together

73
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,230
and not breaking at all. - Whoa!

74
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,490
Now it's time to fill it in,

75
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:50,770
- [Collins] Even the way you fill in the color

76
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:52,570
is super detail-oriented, man.

77
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,177
Like starting from the outside and then working your way in.

78
00:01:54,177 --> 00:01:56,060
- [Devan] All right, fill in his forehead next.

79
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:56,893
- [Collins] He looks really funny

80
00:01:56,893 --> 00:01:58,354
with his ears and forehead filled in right now.

81
00:01:58,354 --> 00:02:00,470
Like, this kind of like weirdly popped out in 3D.

82
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:01,303
Wait, so at what point do you put

83
00:02:01,303 --> 00:02:02,510
a whole bunch of color on it at once?

84
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,640
- [Devan] You gotta put the small stuff down first,

85
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,150
and then fill it in with the large stuff,

86
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,420
so red is last. - Okay.

87
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,253
What other advice do you have

88
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:09,240
on pancake art making, Devan?

89
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,440
- Don't take it too seriously,

90
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,610
because you'll eat it at the end.

91
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:12,700
All right, filling in his shirt.

92
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,610
- [Collins] That doesn't look like a shirt.

93
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,210
That looks way more than a shirt, man.

94
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,160
- Um, spandex!

95
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,460
- I think this may be your best pancake ever, right now.

96
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,410
- [Devan] His shoulder came up a bit,

97
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:20,830
so I'm just pressing it down a little bit

98
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,519
into the batter, and, done.

99
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:23,400
- Here we go, we're just gonna give it

100
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,233
a flip, you ready?

101
00:02:24,233 --> 00:02:26,049
Three, two, one. - Three, two, one.

102
00:02:26,049 --> 00:02:28,609
Oh, oh, oh! - Oh, oh, oh whoa whoa whoa!

103
00:02:28,609 --> 00:02:29,442
Dude!

104
00:02:29,442 --> 00:02:30,830
All right, here we go, gonna flip it around a little bit.

105
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:31,663
- [Devan] Wow.

106
00:02:31,663 --> 00:02:32,496
- And then we're gonna lay it back down

107
00:02:32,496 --> 00:02:33,669
like this, boom, there we go.

108
00:02:33,669 --> 00:02:35,361
- Three, two, one.

109
00:02:35,361 --> 00:02:36,930
Oh! - Oh my gosh!

110
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,080
That's crazy, bro!

111
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,710
The detail is so good.

112
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,220
Look at those armpits!

113
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,560
You get to comment down below,

114
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,393
who won this round?

115
00:02:43,393 --> 00:02:45,520
You challenged us to make Patrick Star from SpongeBob,

116
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,940
so right now, let's go.

117
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,410
- Whoa, it's like a boat.

118
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:49,243
Those are big pants.

119
00:02:49,243 --> 00:02:50,580
- Get this one other leaf over here.

120
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,270
- [Devan] My Patrick is coming along pretty good.

121
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,590
- Yeah, yours is actually looking really good.

122
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,833
Next up, I'm going expert mode.

123
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:55,666
- Aye-aye-aye.

124
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:56,499
- (laughing) So sorry.

125
00:02:56,499 --> 00:02:58,500
I'm going to do his eyes next,

126
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,813
but here we go, we're gonna do one eye right here,

127
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:01,140
then we're gonna do another eye right here,

128
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,040
I see how Devan conjoined the eyes,

129
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,670
so we're gonna give him some (gasps)

130
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:07,050
some green eyes to really match his green pants.

131
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,090
I'm just gonna finish up filling in his eyes, right now.

132
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,210
Now I just have to figure out how to fit

133
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:11,470
the rest of the body into this.

134
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,390
Here we go, we're gonna go for the mouth.

135
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,860
Yeah, huh.

136
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,560
- [Devan] My Patrick is comin' along pretty good.

137
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,910
- [Collins] Yeah, yours is actually looking really good.

138
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,680
- [Devan] Just puttin' on some pants, there we go.

139
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,040
- I'm gonna go for a darker red

140
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:20,960
for the inside of the mouth,

141
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,793
and then of course for the tongue,

142
00:03:21,793 --> 00:03:22,750
I'm gonna go for an orange.

143
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,060
Mine's more lookin' like a teapot than Patrick, dude.

144
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,060
Next up, we gotta give Patrick his little eyebrows up here,

145
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,700
so there we go, eyebrow number one.

146
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,470
Eyebrow number two, wanna give him a little bit of fashion,

147
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:31,810
so we'll give him a squiggly eyebrow.

148
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:32,643
- [Devan] Nice.

149
00:03:32,643 --> 00:03:33,476
- That way you never know

150
00:03:33,476 --> 00:03:34,730
exactly what emotion he's experiencing.

151
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:36,370
Now the easy part, time to fill in the body.

152
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,570
So we're gonna start with the legs over here,

153
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:39,083
so give him nice little leg, just goes like this.

154
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:41,250
This little leg over here, let's give him a little leg.

155
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,720
Really gotta nail this here, so we're gonna go here, arm.

156
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,930
Don't happen to have room for the little thing

157
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,290
on the top of his head, the starfish thing,

158
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,007
and then we go out like that. (laughs)

159
00:03:48,007 --> 00:03:49,850
he looks more like an elephant than anything else right now.

160
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,070
Like he has a long trunk over here,

161
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,550
and a huge ear over here, but you know what?

162
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,383
We're going with it.

163
00:03:53,383 --> 00:03:54,380
I don't wanna miss out on any details

164
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,060
that could cost me the win on this one, so here we go.

165
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,092
Now we're gonna fill it in with the pink.

166
00:03:57,092 --> 00:04:00,460
(peppy ukulele music)

167
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,010
The issue for mine is I kind of missed out

168
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,800
on the key star pattern for Patrick,

169
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,930
but we're gonna flip it and just see how it goes (laughing).

170
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:09,110
- [Devan] It actually kind of looks like SpongeBob.

171
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:09,943
- I mean, you are kinda right.

172
00:04:09,943 --> 00:04:11,900
The only thing mine has in common

173
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,070
with Patrick Star is the colors.

174
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:15,280
Other than that, it's a completely different piece of art.

175
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,510
- [Devan] All right, time to fill in the body.

176
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,740
- [Collins] Why does he have an orange outline,

177
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,573
but a pink body?

178
00:04:18,573 --> 00:04:19,406
- What?

179
00:04:19,406 --> 00:04:20,300
'Cause that's how Patrick Star is.

180
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,133
- Oh, yeah.

181
00:04:21,133 --> 00:04:22,460
Yeah, so no, I didn't do that on mine, Devan.

182
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,270
I just went a little bit more, you know, artistic.

183
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,103
Freehanded it, you know?

184
00:04:25,103 --> 00:04:26,480
- But you got everything else, though, so you're good.

185
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,440
- Yeah, everything else.

186
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,960
Why are you waiting to do the eyes last?

187
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,030
- [Devan] They are white, and they get burned.

188
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:31,863
And, done.

189
00:04:31,863 --> 00:04:33,046
- 24 hours later.

190
00:04:33,046 --> 00:04:34,370
Yo, all right, this is comin' up.

191
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:35,874
- You're gonna need two spatulas, dude.

192
00:04:35,874 --> 00:04:36,773
- Yo, I need two spatulas, so here we go,

193
00:04:36,773 --> 00:04:38,650
just gonna get this one underneath over here.

194
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,177
Uh, oh, you're okay. - Oh, let's take that back.

195
00:04:40,177 --> 00:04:41,101
Let's take that back a second.

196
00:04:41,101 --> 00:04:41,934
- I don't think it's cooked enough.

197
00:04:41,934 --> 00:04:44,280
Gotta turn it up again and let's roast it again.

198
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,830
- Additional five minutes later.

199
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,160
- Yo, dude, it's fully cooked!

200
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,147
Oh, perfect. - Wow, oh man.

201
00:04:48,147 --> 00:04:49,710
- All right, here we go.

202
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,424
Three, two, one. - Three, two, one.

203
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:52,257
(record scratches)

204
00:04:52,257 --> 00:04:53,279
- Hm, how do I wanna do this?

205
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:54,112
Uh.

206
00:04:54,112 --> 00:04:54,945
- Now is not the time to decide!

207
00:04:54,945 --> 00:04:55,778
- If I let go of this spatula,

208
00:04:55,778 --> 00:04:57,694
And then... - No, this is not a good idea.

209
00:04:57,694 --> 00:04:58,743
How are you flipping it? - Three, two,

210
00:04:58,743 --> 00:04:59,576
What, like this.

211
00:04:59,576 --> 00:05:00,409
- What?

212
00:05:00,409 --> 00:05:01,242
That did not happen.

213
00:05:01,242 --> 00:05:02,075
- There we go, bro, (triumphant music)

214
00:05:02,075 --> 00:05:02,908
there we go.

215
00:05:02,908 --> 00:05:03,741
It lost all color.

216
00:05:03,741 --> 00:05:04,574
- Yeah.

217
00:05:04,574 --> 00:05:05,407
- You know what, bro?

218
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,420
Not too bad, for, at all.

219
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,253
That's great. (ding)

220
00:05:08,253 --> 00:05:09,086
Let's flips yours, let's see how yours...

221
00:05:09,086 --> 00:05:10,460
- Okay, I need the other spatula.

222
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,300
Three, two, one, oh--

223
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,430
- We're doing the five seconds to subscribe challenge.

224
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,260
We wanna see if you can subscribe to this channel,

225
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,940
and turn on the channel post notifications

226
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,610
in five seconds, you ready?

227
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,443
Here we go.

228
00:05:19,443 --> 00:05:22,260
Five, four, three, - Five, four, three,

229
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,953
two, one, done. - Two, one, done.

230
00:05:23,953 --> 00:05:24,900
If you can do that, comment down below.

231
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,920
Keyper Squad, right now.

232
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,776
- [Devan] Ready, set, go!

233
00:05:27,776 --> 00:05:28,943
Oh! - Oh, yo dude!

234
00:05:28,943 --> 00:05:31,000
That looks so crazy!

235
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,080
You get to comment down below.

236
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,250
Let us know who won this round,

237
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,410
and we're on to the next one.

238
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:36,360
You challenged us to make Dumbo, so let's go.

239
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,350
I'm gonna start with his most iconic feature, the eyebrows.

240
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,183
- What?

241
00:05:40,183 --> 00:05:41,016
Those are big eyebrows.

242
00:05:41,016 --> 00:05:41,860
(Collins laughs)

243
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,424
How big is his face? - Yeah, here we go.

244
00:05:43,424 --> 00:05:44,528
- All right, well, I'm starting with the hat.

245
00:05:44,528 --> 00:05:47,695
(peppy ukulele music)

246
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,370
- This is gonna be an inverted Dumbo,

247
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:52,010
so he's gonna have little tiny little ears,

248
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:52,843
like that. - What?

249
00:05:52,843 --> 00:05:53,676
- Here we go, and then another

250
00:05:53,676 --> 00:05:54,509
little tiny little ear over here,

251
00:05:54,509 --> 00:05:55,342
boom, just like that. - Is that even like,

252
00:05:55,342 --> 00:05:56,250
technically Dumbo, though?

253
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,373
All right, and the hat is done.

254
00:05:57,373 --> 00:05:58,206
- [Collins] Top of his head.

255
00:05:58,206 --> 00:05:59,130
- [Devan] And he's got two little hairs, too.

256
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,350
- The two hairs are very important.

257
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:01,380
- It's all that's keeping him together.

258
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,630
- Dumbo's got some beautiful blue eyes,

259
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,430
so next up, we got the blue here.

260
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,780
Wait, this is alternate universe Dumbo,

261
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,600
so, we're gonna have him get red eyes.

262
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,620
I hope Dumbo doesn't end up being too scary, man,

263
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,140
'cause, hoo, he's looking like he has

264
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,123
an eye infection right now.

265
00:06:12,123 --> 00:06:13,381
- He's gotta get that checked out.

266
00:06:13,381 --> 00:06:15,190
All right, and the hat is done, now it's time

267
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,023
for the top of the head.

268
00:06:16,023 --> 00:06:17,950
- Gonna add the outline of his head here,

269
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,683
so, bloop, and like this, and get the trunk over there.

270
00:06:19,683 --> 00:06:21,590
All right, now we gotta give Dumbo

271
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,290
his little hat over here, so a little hat, like that.

272
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:26,300
Just add some pink in here, to the ears.

273
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,000
They look like those iconic Dumbo ears.

274
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,080
And by iconic, I mean, slightly different.

275
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,410
Oh man, I almost forgot about his mouth.

276
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:32,300
We gotta get his mouth in here,

277
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,270
so we're gonna go, yeah, like, uh-oh.

278
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:36,216
Uh-oh, Dumbo doesn't look too happy right now.

279
00:06:36,216 --> 00:06:37,200
All right, let's see here, we're gonna give him

280
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,090
a little tongue, so he can be a happy little dude.

281
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:40,923
He can be like, "Yeah, what's up?

282
00:06:40,923 --> 00:06:42,020
"This is my tongue."

283
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,210
The last element I'm gonna be adding is the frills,

284
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:46,170
so here we go, frilly, frilly frills.

285
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:47,930
I mean, it's something, you can't deny,

286
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:49,470
that is something, rather than nothing.

287
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:50,910
- All right, just finishing up the trunk.

288
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,280
Okay, got it, yup, yup.

289
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,680
Just checking in with myself, it works.

290
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,130
I'm actually gonna fill in some of the hat,

291
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:55,963
just like you, Collins.

292
00:06:55,963 --> 00:06:57,470
- I actually haven't filled in my hat yet, Devan,

293
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:58,440
so I don't know what you're talking about.

294
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,740
He's looking more like a sad clown

295
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,767
than anything else right now, man.

296
00:07:00,767 --> 00:07:02,630
- [Devan] All right, filling in his little tongue,

297
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,570
very cute little tongue.

298
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:04,940
- Man, that's actually really adorable.

299
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,530
You know what, he needs two nostrils, yeah!

300
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:08,920
Three nostrils!

301
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,753
- Whoa.

302
00:07:09,753 --> 00:07:10,960
- That's a ton of air intake!

303
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,900
- A little excessive.

304
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,260
I mean, how much do you need to smell?

305
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,130
- It's not about smelling, it's about

306
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,747
sucking up waters, and shooting it out.

307
00:07:15,747 --> 00:07:16,580
- Oh.

308
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,500
- All right, gonna give him a little purple hat,

309
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,720
'cause this boy is royalty.

310
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,883
See, I'm really gonna try these details here.

311
00:07:19,883 --> 00:07:22,010
It's like, Devan does details around the mouth,

312
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,130
like, maybe like that'll help,

313
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,325
like this little line over there.

314
00:07:24,325 --> 00:07:25,158
(Collins chuckles mischievously)

315
00:07:25,158 --> 00:07:26,200
Now it looks like he has pudgy cheeks.

316
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,560
Okay, maybe not that, let's try some other lines.

317
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,200
- [Devan] How 'bout some eyelashes, that's what I'm doing.

318
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,830
He looks like a worried Dumbo right now.

319
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,747
- Oh my gosh, yeah, he does look worried, man.

320
00:07:33,747 --> 00:07:34,580
All right, we're gonna start

321
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,770
filling in his trunk over here.

322
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,220
Now I'm gonna start adding a lot more,

323
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,500
and kind of letting it overflow,

324
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,530
letting it all fill up the cracks and crevices.

325
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:41,930
Boom! It is done!

326
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,750
Dumbo, in all of his magnificence, (chuckling)

327
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,156
and his tiny little ears.

328
00:07:45,156 --> 00:07:46,200
All right, just gonna let mine roast, and,

329
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,850
oh man, that's looking really good.

330
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,830
- [Devan] All right, time to fill in his ear flaps.

331
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,900
Filling in his second ear right now.

332
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,150
- It's crazy how yours goes from just

333
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:55,020
a whole bunch of outlines to super vibrant

334
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,711
the moment all the color starts adding in.

335
00:07:56,711 --> 00:07:58,254
It's like the whole image just comes to life.

336
00:07:58,254 --> 00:08:01,421
(peppy ukulele music)

337
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,220
Nice, all right, now we gotta let these roast.

338
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,930
We'll be flipping 'em and see how they turned out.

339
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,420
All right, time to get this thing off my griddle,

340
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,090
so here we go, gonna get the ear first,

341
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:10,990
and oh boy, you know what, maybe, oops!

342
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,180
- I have faith in you, Collins.

343
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,210
I think you'll be able to do it.

344
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:14,043
- I don't.

345
00:08:14,043 --> 00:08:14,876
Three, two, one. - Yeah, two, one.

346
00:08:14,876 --> 00:08:16,853
(Collins screaming in excitement)

347
00:08:16,853 --> 00:08:18,670
That is clean in there.

348
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:21,100
- Yeah, this is a great Dumbo, man.

349
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,840
- [Devan] Oh, I forgot to Pam it again!

350
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,673
Ready?

351
00:08:24,673 --> 00:08:25,907
Set, go!

352
00:08:25,907 --> 00:08:27,630
Oh, dude! - Oh, my gosh!

353
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:28,760
You get to comment down below.

354
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,400
Who made a better Dumbo pancake?

355
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,300
You challenged us to make a Superman pancake,

356
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,630
so right now, let's go.

357
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,760
I'm gonna kick it off with Superman's

358
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,490
iconic logo, the diamond.

359
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,240
Looks almost more like a question mark than an S.

360
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,073
- [Devan] And look at this.

361
00:08:39,073 --> 00:08:39,960
- [Collins] Wait, does he have, like, little wings

362
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,910
coming out of his shoulder?

363
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:42,080
- [Devan] I guess you could say that, I mean,

364
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,147
it's his cape, so, yeah.

365
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:44,060
- Oh, gotcha.

366
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,030
All right, here we go, gonna be filling in the S.

367
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:46,863
Time to give him a head.

368
00:08:46,863 --> 00:08:48,250
Now the head is the most important part of Superman,

369
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,931
so really gotta get this right, here we go.

370
00:08:49,931 --> 00:08:51,080
Yeah, that seems pretty proportional to me.

371
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,060
Okay, perfect.

372
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,170
- [Devan] All right, just working on the S.

373
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:54,980
The tricky part is doing this backwards.

374
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,100
Or I guess inverted.

375
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,500
- [Collins] Next up, we're gonna give him some blue eyes.

376
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,910
We're gonna add some blue into here.

377
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,690
- [Devan] I think I made his waist a little too narrow,

378
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:02,141
so I gotta broaden this out a little bit.

379
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:03,990
- Okay, Devan, that is unrealistic standards right there,

380
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,350
he does not have that thin of a waist.

381
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:08,131
He's gonna have a very angry unibrow, boom.

382
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:09,490
- I this him in disguise, Collins?

383
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:10,653
- No, oh, that's such a good idea!

384
00:09:10,653 --> 00:09:12,020
- I think that's what it is.

385
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,130
- [Collins] I'll put some glasses on him, like this, bam!

386
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,480
- Wait, where did Superman go, dude?

387
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,490
- [Collins] He's fully gone.

388
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:17,800
- [Devan] I think I'm almost done, actually.

389
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,810
I think I just gotta add his cape in the back here.

390
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,040
- Wait, you're almost done?

391
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:21,873
Dude, I'm like just, - Yeah, dude, I'm almost done.

392
00:09:21,873 --> 00:09:23,043
Okay, I gotta go a lot faster, right now.

393
00:09:23,043 --> 00:09:24,550
I gotta give him some hair and neck,

394
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,630
so here we go, just gonna give him some good lookin' hair.

395
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,130
- [Devan] You know what, I don't wanna do a big cape.

396
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:28,963
- [Collins] All right, now, gotta give him

397
00:09:28,963 --> 00:09:31,280
a little swirl curl on his forehead here.

398
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,820
- [Devan] All right, it's time to add in the colors here.

399
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,910
I'm gonna start with the yellow.

400
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,320
- My Superman is gonna have some freckles,

401
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,340
because, you know, you really gotta,

402
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,470
he's gonna be in disguise.

403
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:38,303
And now we're gonna fill in the neck.

404
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,800
- [Devan] I'm gonna turn my griddle off,

405
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,710
so nothing raises up.

406
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,450
- Thing is, Superman doesn't shave very often,

407
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,360
so he's got a little bit of weird stubble

408
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,270
goin' on right now.

409
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,790
Yeah, Superman's got some crazy hair.

410
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:47,623
- Oh, dude!

411
00:09:47,623 --> 00:09:48,456
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

412
00:09:48,456 --> 00:09:49,289
- Dude, that was a massive bump!

413
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:50,690
- I'm sorry, I accidentally got too excited.

414
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,420
The thing is, Devan, does your guy even have abs?

415
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,253
I don't think he does.

416
00:09:53,253 --> 00:09:55,560
- Uh, he has the implied abs, Collins.

417
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,460
- The what? How does--

418
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,950
- He's wearing a shirt, so you're not gonna see

419
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:59,610
the full definition in his abs.

420
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,210
- But technically, we all have implied abs.

421
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:02,500
- [Devan] All right, adding in the shadow

422
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,940
on the side of his face.

423
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,010
- Here we go, gonna fill in all the abs first,

424
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:07,528
and we're gonna get this over here.

425
00:10:07,528 --> 00:10:08,570
All right, here we go, next up we got the cape,

426
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:09,650
so here we're just gonna allow this cape

427
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,375
to go back like this, just flows over his beard.

428
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:16,040
(peppy ukulele music)

429
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,760
last up, just gotta fill up his face right now,

430
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,740
so this is really where I think you get to

431
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,583
highlight all the freckles, all the beauteous,

432
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:21,550
uh, beauty in his face.

433
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:24,951
- [Devan] Now it's time to fill in the rest of the blue.

434
00:10:24,951 --> 00:10:28,118
(peppy ukulele music)

435
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:31,310
all right, doing the last bit on his face here.

436
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,143
- I wanna give him laser eyes.

437
00:10:32,143 --> 00:10:33,433
Boom, and it's done.

438
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:34,273
Now it's gotta turn up, and let it roast.

439
00:10:34,273 --> 00:10:36,500
All right, mine is fully cooked right now,

440
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,333
and here we go with the flip.

441
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,883
Three, two, one. - Two, one.

442
00:10:39,883 --> 00:10:43,640
Oh, nicely done! - Oh, dude I nailed that, bro.

443
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,473
Look at it!

444
00:10:44,473 --> 00:10:45,790
So, right now, let's see how yours turned out.

445
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:48,516
- All right, ready, set, go!

446
00:10:48,516 --> 00:10:50,460
Oh, dude! - Oh my gosh!

447
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,070
That looks so good, bro!

448
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,210
You get to comment down below.

449
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,340
Who made a better Superman?

450
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,510
And we're on to the next one.

451
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,020
You challenged up to make Captain Marvel

452
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,980
from her new movie, and right now, let's go.

453
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,170
Per usual, I'm gonna start off with her head, oops.

454
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,072
- Oops?

455
00:11:02,072 --> 00:11:03,600
It looks more like that meme dude, who's like ahhh.

456
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,640
We're gonna go with it though.

457
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,500
- [Devan] Man, it is so hard to do detail

458
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,520
with pancake batter, bro.

459
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,643
- So I think it goes up, then there's, like,

460
00:11:08,643 --> 00:11:09,894
a little thingie there.

461
00:11:09,894 --> 00:11:10,727
(Collins chuckles)

462
00:11:10,727 --> 00:11:11,560
It looks like a rubber ducky.

463
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,393
(squeaking)

464
00:11:12,393 --> 00:11:13,619
Oh my gosh! (laughing)

465
00:11:13,619 --> 00:11:15,250
All right, we're gonna give her some blue eyes.

466
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,310
Now we're gonna fill this in with red,

467
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:17,560
and give her some beautiful lips.

468
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,220
Next up is very important, her hair.

469
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,210
She's got nice blond hair.

470
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:22,240
To be honest, I am pretty worried

471
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,510
about how this is gonna turn out.

472
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,562
- She's goin' bald.

473
00:11:24,562 --> 00:11:26,540
(peppy ukulele music)

474
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,900
- Long hair, long beautiful hair, lotta curls on it.

475
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:29,860
She curls her hair regularly.

476
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:33,210
That is gonna be very beautiful, but very difficult to flip.

477
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:34,240
I gotta try and fix this.

478
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,730
My solution is more hair.

479
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:36,563
- What?

480
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:37,396
- [Collins] It needs more hair.

481
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:38,690
- [Devan] Yeah, I think it does, actually.

482
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,360
- She's got one marvelous hair.

483
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,410
I do wanna fill in just a little bit more

484
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,800
on the eyebrow right here.

485
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,693
Oh, no, it's Hoot-dini! - What?

486
00:11:44,693 --> 00:11:45,950
Seriously, again?

487
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:46,783
- Oh my gosh, all right, well,

488
00:11:46,783 --> 00:11:48,486
time to spin for our wild cards.

489
00:11:48,486 --> 00:11:49,324
- All right.

490
00:11:49,324 --> 00:11:50,157
- And again, I really hope it's good.

491
00:11:50,157 --> 00:11:52,099
Here we go, three, two, one.

492
00:11:52,099 --> 00:11:53,119
(wheels clicking)

493
00:11:53,119 --> 00:11:53,996
All right, let's see what this one is.

494
00:11:53,996 --> 00:11:54,950
(Devan groaning)

495
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:55,783
Wasabi?

496
00:11:55,783 --> 00:11:57,280
- Oh, you have to add wasabi to it!

497
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,200
- Oh, man!

498
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,660
- Well, mine I have to wear boxing gloves.

499
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,493
Let's do this.

500
00:12:00,493 --> 00:12:02,500
- Dude, I dunno where I'm gonna add this.

501
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,770
- [Collins] Pick up my yellow now, here we go.

502
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:05,030
Oh, I'm actually pretty good at this.

503
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:07,330
- All right, it's all mixed up, and it's expanding now,

504
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:08,483
because I mixed it, man.

505
00:12:08,483 --> 00:12:09,630
- All right, I gotta grab my next color.

506
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,250
Oh, uncontrollable. - Oh, boy.

507
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,010
- Okay, let's see, oh.

508
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:14,890
Tip it over, and there we go.

509
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:16,370
This is workin' great.

510
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,060
Uh-oh, gotta be very careful not to break the hair.

511
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:18,893
Oh, I just had an idea.

512
00:12:18,893 --> 00:12:20,740
What if I channeled Captain Marvel's powers?

513
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,649
All right, here we go, three, two, one.

514
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:23,482
(zapping and whooshing)

515
00:12:23,482 --> 00:12:24,670
Whoa, this is so cool!

516
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:25,503
- What?

517
00:12:25,503 --> 00:12:26,560
- Oh my gosh, I love this!

518
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,393
Hey Devan, fist bump!

519
00:12:27,393 --> 00:12:28,810
- Wow, whoa, hey, I'm not doing that.

520
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:29,643
It's glowing.

521
00:12:29,643 --> 00:12:31,350
- Yeah, that's the whole point, is a glowing glove.

522
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,183
Three.

523
00:12:32,183 --> 00:12:33,016
- Okay.

524
00:12:33,016 --> 00:12:33,849
- Go for it man, two.

525
00:12:33,849 --> 00:12:34,682
- Okay.

526
00:12:34,682 --> 00:12:35,519
- Here we go, one.

527
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,550
(power surging) (Devan yelling)

528
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,790
These are awesome!

529
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,330
All right, now I gotta grab the blue, there we go,

530
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:43,210
now I gotta, (yells)

531
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:44,340
It spouted upwards.

532
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,173
Just down the middle like that.

533
00:12:45,173 --> 00:12:46,560
- I love just checking in once in awhile,

534
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,430
to see what you're up to.

535
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:48,399
- I'm always up to something.

536
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,566
(peppy ukulele music)

537
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,860
- All right, the outline is done,

538
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,170
and now it's time to color it in.

539
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,290
I'm going in for the hair,

540
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:57,777
and I'm using the wasabi now.

541
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:58,770
(whimpering)

542
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:01,930
Look at this, dude, this does not mix around at all.

543
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:03,570
- All right, here we go, it's time for the flip.

544
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:04,403
You ready, Devan?

545
00:13:04,403 --> 00:13:06,590
Three, two, one.

546
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,370
No, oh, oh! - Oh!

547
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,203
- Oh, it's great.

548
00:13:09,203 --> 00:13:10,036
- [Devan] You got it on mine.

549
00:13:10,036 --> 00:13:10,869
- I don't have thumbs I can use.

550
00:13:10,869 --> 00:13:12,520
It's so tough to work with these gloves.

551
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,000
All right, now I just gotta rotate her a little bit.

552
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,240
Ta-da, mine is done, and I crushed it.

553
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,680
Unfortunately, she lost a lot of her hair,

554
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,220
but now she's got a buzz cut, so, there's that.

555
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:24,387
(peppy ukulele music)

556
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,533
- [Devan] And done!

557
00:13:27,533 --> 00:13:28,366
- I can't wait to see what this thing

558
00:13:28,366 --> 00:13:29,199
looks like when you flip it,

559
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:30,620
though, its gonna look so cool.

560
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,067
- Now, it's just time to add the flames.

561
00:13:32,067 --> 00:13:33,400
- [Collins] Wait, wait, wait, yours has flames?

562
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,240
- Ah, what a bummer, I'm all out of the wasabi yellow.

563
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,440
I have to use more of the actual yellow.

564
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,273
- That's not right.

565
00:13:39,273 --> 00:13:40,106
- Bummer!

566
00:13:40,106 --> 00:13:40,939
- You should use straight wasabi, make it a green--

567
00:13:40,939 --> 00:13:42,887
- No, no, too quick, I mean, uh, too late!

568
00:13:42,887 --> 00:13:44,850
Ha ha, ha, I'm too quick.

569
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:47,300
Bro, as it's cooking, it's making my eyes water

570
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,790
because of the wasabi in there.

571
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:49,970
All right, it's ready for the flip.

572
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:51,620
This is always the most stressful part.

573
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,390
Ready, set, go!

574
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:55,730
- Oh, and if you wanna win a 15 minute video call,

575
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:59,070
with Devan and I, text the word ART to 81800, right now.

576
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:01,610
So pause the video, text the word ART to 81800,

577
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:03,007
and you'll automatically be entered in to win.

578
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,840
And right now, let's see how this looks.

579
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,710
Ready, set, go.

580
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:09,970
- Oh, that looks amazing!

581
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:11,150
You get to comment down below.

582
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,830
Who made a better Captain Marvel?

583
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:15,369
You challenged up to make Steve from Minecraft, so let's go.

584
00:14:15,369 --> 00:14:17,775
I think this is a deceptively easy seeming pancake,

585
00:14:17,775 --> 00:14:19,400
'cause like, it seems it's like a whole bunch of boxes.

586
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,810
I know it's gonna be way more hard than that.

587
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:21,690
- All right, hair is done.

588
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:22,523
- [Collins] We'll give him little legs

589
00:14:22,523 --> 00:14:23,430
that pop out over here.

590
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,770
He's doing a mid-air splits jump.

591
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:26,320
- [Devan] Now I'm goin' for the side of the face.

592
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,320
- Next up, gotta give this dude a little bit

593
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,443
of chest hair right there, just like that.

594
00:14:28,443 --> 00:14:30,440
He's got this little patch of chest hair

595
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,420
that's just popping out, you know?

596
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,560
Just bursting through his shirt.

597
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,120
And I'm gonna fill in his shirt next.

598
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,390
Bohh-hoo!

599
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,870
I'm gonna give him a cool shirt design.

600
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,910
And if I could just grab, I think this is what I need.

601
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:39,869
Nope, nevermind. - What?

602
00:14:39,869 --> 00:14:40,710
Don't you have it on your side?

603
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,210
- Uh, yeah, oh, I guess I do, yup.

604
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,193
Make him fancy, you know, so here we go.

605
00:14:43,193 --> 00:14:44,780
Just gonna give him little buttons, like this.

606
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:45,613
Here we go, button.

607
00:14:45,613 --> 00:14:47,690
- [Devan] And mouth is done, now on to the eyes.

608
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:48,560
- Yours, actually, yeah, yours

609
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,550
is looking really good right now.

610
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,480
Just like that, now we're gonna give him

611
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,760
a little bit of like a shirt collar.

612
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,040
Little pointy bit, and the up like that, boom.

613
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,690
Man, you know what, I'm taking some creative liberties,

614
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:57,380
but I think it's really paying off with my guy right now.

615
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,320
My guy's gonna have a dragon on his shirt.

616
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,153
- Wait...

617
00:14:59,153 --> 00:15:00,580
- So we're gonna give him some yellow flames

618
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,946
that he's spittin' out over here, he's like "rawr."

619
00:15:02,946 --> 00:15:04,410
Next up, we're gonna give him some red shoes.

620
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:05,400
'Cause you know, why not?

621
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,649
Fashion is Steve's passion.

622
00:15:06,649 --> 00:15:08,930
(peppy ukulele music)

623
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:10,650
All right, cool, so the dragon on the shirt is done.

624
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:11,790
You know, He's feeling really manly.

625
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,690
He's got the chest hair, he's got a dragon on his shirt.

626
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:14,610
Steve's having a great day.

627
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:16,130
- [Devan] Just doing his sleeve right now.

628
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:19,333
And now I have to move on to, I think, the side of his arm.

629
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,950
- All right, giving him some light blue legs,

630
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:22,330
which doesn't necessarily make sense,

631
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:23,480
but we're just gonna go for it.

632
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,790
- Kinda like playing Tetris.

633
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,130
Hey, I just realized, he has the same shirt as you, bro.

634
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:27,963
- Oh!

635
00:15:27,963 --> 00:15:28,796
Wait, did you give him a dragon?

636
00:15:28,796 --> 00:15:29,629
- What?

637
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:30,462
No, no, no, he's got a blue shirt on.

638
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:31,295
- I was about to say, I'm like,

639
00:15:31,295 --> 00:15:32,128
you can't just give your guy a dragon.

640
00:15:32,128 --> 00:15:34,130
- [Devan] This one's actually surprisingly difficult,

641
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,540
'cause there's so many straight lines,

642
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:38,140
and pancake batter does not work in straight lines.

643
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,690
Now I'm gettin' the top of his jeans.

644
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:40,523
- Uh-oh. - What?

645
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:41,356
What, what, what? (Collins screams)

646
00:15:41,356 --> 00:15:43,350
- Wait, wait, wait, that's really good.

647
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,183
- That's a square eye.

648
00:15:44,183 --> 00:15:46,670
All right, time to get his second arm in there,

649
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,900
just like that.

650
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,310
- Oh, man, I've, like, discovered

651
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:50,610
some hidden talents all of the sudden.

652
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:51,730
Man, look at those two eyes.

653
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:52,690
This is on another level.

654
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:53,800
Ooh! - Ooh,

655
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,760
gotta alter the arm a little bit here.

656
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,593
Gonna move it around.

657
00:15:56,593 --> 00:15:57,488
Ooh, this is tough.

658
00:15:57,488 --> 00:15:58,321
Oh, yup. - There we go.

659
00:15:58,321 --> 00:15:59,620
Next up, got a bit of a square nose.

660
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,830
Yeah, it started to fall apart.

661
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:02,230
I really thought I had it, for a second.

662
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,780
Now it's kind of falling apart, now.

663
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,300
- [Devan] Oh, I almost broke his arm off, dude.

664
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,961
Okay, wait, I'm gonna glue it back together, now.

665
00:16:06,961 --> 00:16:08,110
That was a fast one, - Oh, man,

666
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,340
you're even playing with perspective.

667
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,370
You got one arm swinging back,

668
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:11,337
one arm swinging forward right now.

669
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:12,890
- I know, I don't think it'd really translate,

670
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,810
but look at his leg, man, it's going, like, way back.

671
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:16,327
- All right, now I'm gonna fill in his face right here,

672
00:16:16,327 --> 00:16:18,320
and I'm almost done with Steve, man.

673
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,880
Minecraft is definitely my round.

674
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,749
All right, mine's done, but I'm gonna add

675
00:16:20,749 --> 00:16:22,250
an extra element to it, Devan,

676
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,820
so you've gotta try to guess what this is.

677
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,520
- [Devan] Just removing a foot real quick.

678
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,410
Now I gotta add the shadow on the leg.

679
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:28,540
There's the heel of his foot.

680
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,990
- If you had to guess what I'm making right now,

681
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,090
what would you guess this is.

682
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,700
- Oh, wai, oop, I need that.

683
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,060
- I was just using it.

684
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,000
- [Devan] A J?

685
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,833
- [Collins] Nope.

686
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:36,740
- A pogo sticking person?

687
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,470
A J with some blue on it?

688
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:39,330
A bluejay!

689
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,010
- I can see where you're going, but no, not really.

690
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:41,843
Here we go. - A red and bluejay?

691
00:16:41,843 --> 00:16:42,676
- It's gonna go like this.

692
00:16:42,676 --> 00:16:44,220
- Dude, I don't know, man.

693
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,558
- It's the Tik Tok logo, Devan.

694
00:16:45,558 --> 00:16:46,391
- [Devan] Huh?

695
00:16:46,391 --> 00:16:47,224
Steve is Tik Tok famous.

696
00:16:47,224 --> 00:16:48,057
- [Devan] All right, well my pancake is done.

697
00:16:48,057 --> 00:16:49,640
- I think it's time to flip mine,

698
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,240
and he looks like he's in, like, a onesie right now.

699
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,073
Like, he's about to go to bed.

700
00:16:52,073 --> 00:16:53,580
Yup. - Did you put Pam down, bro?

701
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,656
- I didn't, I never do.

702
00:16:54,656 --> 00:16:56,505
Gonna start over here again. (Devan groaning)

703
00:16:56,505 --> 00:16:57,713
Start with the head a little bit.

704
00:16:57,713 --> 00:16:59,610
He's a bit of an acrobat, so being in the air

705
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:00,840
should be usual for him.

706
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,313
Three, two, one. - Three, two, one.

707
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:03,146
(record scratches)

708
00:17:03,146 --> 00:17:04,096
- Oh, his arm stuck!

709
00:17:04,096 --> 00:17:04,929
- You didn't commit!

710
00:17:04,929 --> 00:17:05,762
- Oh, oh no!

711
00:17:05,762 --> 00:17:06,595
- [Devan] You didn't commit!

712
00:17:06,595 --> 00:17:07,428
- Oh no, he's stuck!

713
00:17:07,428 --> 00:17:09,120
Okay, this is my greatest work yet, dude.

714
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,217
And now, time to see how yours turned out.

715
00:17:10,217 --> 00:17:12,630
- All right, dude, he comes up so easily.

716
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,790
- Oh my gosh, yeah, yours came right off.

717
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:16,280
Even with no Pam and everything.

718
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,770
- [Devan] Three, two, one--

719
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:18,870
- We want a three second like challenge.

720
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:20,190
We wanna see if you can like this video

721
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:21,613
in three seconds, you ready?

722
00:17:21,613 --> 00:17:22,470
Here we go

723
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:25,460
Three, two, one, done. - Three, two, one, done.

724
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,780
Ready, set, go!

725
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,180
Oh! - Oh, that looks so good!

726
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:31,240
You get to comment down below, who made a better Steve?

727
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,140
You challenged us to make the Genie from Aladdin.

728
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,300
- [Devan] I'm starting with one eyebrow.

729
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,880
- See, I'm gonna make the Genie lamp,

730
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,158
as well as the Genie.

731
00:17:37,158 --> 00:17:38,660
So now I'm just gonna fill in the genie lamp here,

732
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,410
so we're gonna add some yellow to it.

733
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,160
The only issue is with how I placed the Genie bottle,

734
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,660
it makes it kind of difficult to get the Genie out,

735
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,520
so I'm gonna have to do a little bit of wind around work.

736
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,410
Now for this next part, I need some very special

737
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:49,910
pancake batter, so, here we go, ta-da!

738
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:50,743
- Wow.

739
00:17:50,743 --> 00:17:51,576
- All right. (yelling)

740
00:17:51,576 --> 00:17:52,800
- Whoa, man!

741
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,710
- The big thing about the Genie

742
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:54,760
is he has a huge smile.

743
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,952
Gotta give him some stubble, or some beard.

744
00:17:56,952 --> 00:17:59,143
This is the Genie after he's freshly been shaved.

745
00:17:59,143 --> 00:18:02,310
(peppy ukulele music)

746
00:18:03,858 --> 00:18:05,010
Now it's time to fill in his teeth,

747
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:07,270
so gotta get those nice pearly whites, right now.

748
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,832
No, its Hoot-dini! - What, oh!

749
00:18:08,832 --> 00:18:10,487
- Come on, I need to like, finish this more.

750
00:18:10,487 --> 00:18:11,783
- All done with the teeth, man.

751
00:18:11,783 --> 00:18:13,170
- Well I guess we gotta spin for the wild card,

752
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:14,003
so here we go, are you ready?

753
00:18:14,003 --> 00:18:15,158
Three, two, one. - Three, two, one.

754
00:18:15,158 --> 00:18:16,430
(wheels clicking)

755
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,570
- Let's see, I got red.

756
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:19,493
- No, tiny hands, bro!

757
00:18:19,493 --> 00:18:20,753
- Yes, dude, you got tiny hands!

758
00:18:20,753 --> 00:18:21,787
That's one of my favorite things on here.

759
00:18:21,787 --> 00:18:22,620
- No, what!

760
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:23,460
- [Collins] Egg on spoon.

761
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,616
- I don't know how I'm gonna squeeze the bottle, man.

762
00:18:25,616 --> 00:18:26,958
(Collin mumbles)

763
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:28,920
Oh, oh, I forgot to turn on the pan.

764
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,753
I won't make you-- (dramatic music)

765
00:18:29,753 --> 00:18:30,586
Whoa.

766
00:18:30,586 --> 00:18:31,837
- Here's the thing, I'm gonna make a creative decision

767
00:18:31,837 --> 00:18:34,597
and turn my grill on, and give my guy a yellow tooth.

768
00:18:34,597 --> 00:18:35,430
(Devan groaning)

769
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,263
- It's so hard to grip.

770
00:18:36,263 --> 00:18:38,303
Gotta shake it up, now, oh, man,

771
00:18:38,303 --> 00:18:39,870
that was like a trick.

772
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,930
- Here we go guys, arm number one, perfect.

773
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,360
All right, we got arm number two.

774
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,011
- [Devan] This takes tremendous grip strength.

775
00:18:45,011 --> 00:18:46,623
- Yeah, this takes tremendous grip strength, bite strength.

776
00:18:46,623 --> 00:18:49,180
Gonna fill in his body like this.

777
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,560
- Hand cramp, hand cramp!

778
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,480
- I got a jaw cramp right now, man.

779
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,970
Okay, its time for the flip. (laughing)

780
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:56,810
Here we go, I just have to balance my egg,

781
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:59,590
and do a very complex flipping motion.

782
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:00,732
Three, two, one.

783
00:19:00,732 --> 00:19:01,565
- [Devan] Oh.

784
00:19:01,565 --> 00:19:02,989
Oh, you got it. - Oh, I did it!

785
00:19:02,989 --> 00:19:03,945
All right, that's perfect, we got,

786
00:19:03,945 --> 00:19:05,528
Oh no! - Oh!

787
00:19:05,528 --> 00:19:06,361
- You know what, that's actually kind of perfect,

788
00:19:06,361 --> 00:19:07,473
we'll make a little, - Yeah, whoa, whoa, whoa.

789
00:19:07,473 --> 00:19:08,680
Move your pancake, - egg dish right now,

790
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,633
in the midst of all this. - move your pancake.

791
00:19:09,633 --> 00:19:10,502
Let me help, let me help. - It's actually

792
00:19:10,502 --> 00:19:11,335
kind of perfect, there we go. - Let me help, there you go.

793
00:19:11,335 --> 00:19:12,168
- [Collins] Boom.

794
00:19:12,168 --> 00:19:13,001
- Collins, do you have any napkins?

795
00:19:13,001 --> 00:19:13,834
I need to wipe up.

796
00:19:13,834 --> 00:19:14,667
- [Collins] Yup, got a little napkin for you.

797
00:19:14,667 --> 00:19:15,500
- [Devan] Oh, thank you so much.

798
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,333
- [Collins] Yup, there you go

799
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:17,166
if you wanna clean off your hands.

800
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:17,999
- Okay, yup.

801
00:19:17,999 --> 00:19:18,832
Now it's time to fill it in with the blue.

802
00:19:18,832 --> 00:19:21,420
Oh, I can't believe I've gripped it so far!

803
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,380
- How have you done that, bro?

804
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,723
You have, like, Spider-Man hands right now.

805
00:19:23,723 --> 00:19:24,556
- I don't know.

806
00:19:24,556 --> 00:19:26,011
Press down with both hands, like CPR.

807
00:19:26,011 --> 00:19:27,050
- That's actually really smart, man.

808
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:27,960
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

809
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,832
- Hi-yah!

810
00:19:28,832 --> 00:19:29,665
Hi-yah!

811
00:19:29,665 --> 00:19:30,498
- [Collins] Be careful, man.

812
00:19:30,498 --> 00:19:31,331
(Devan grunting)

813
00:19:31,331 --> 00:19:32,164
- [Devan] Now I've gotta rotate it around.

814
00:19:32,164 --> 00:19:33,100
Oh, if I just tip it, I'm good.

815
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:33,933
- Oh, I just had an idea.

816
00:19:33,933 --> 00:19:35,930
What if I add pancake batter to the egg?

817
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:37,853
Oh, this is gonna work, have to inject it

818
00:19:37,853 --> 00:19:38,686
into the yolk. - Dude, wait, what?

819
00:19:38,686 --> 00:19:40,018
Dude, are you seeing this?

820
00:19:40,018 --> 00:19:41,051
- No, are you seeing this?

821
00:19:41,051 --> 00:19:42,174
- No, are you seeing this.

822
00:19:42,174 --> 00:19:43,507
- [Collins] No Devan, are you seeing this?

823
00:19:43,507 --> 00:19:45,560
- Collins, I'm doing the fly-over, bro.

824
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,410
Oh, no.

825
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:47,243
- Uh-oh.

826
00:19:47,243 --> 00:19:49,221
- I can't put any pressure on it.

827
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:50,380
- I'll help you a little bit with the pressure.

828
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,455
- Oh, oh whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

829
00:19:51,455 --> 00:19:53,560
Oh, man! - Oh, no!

830
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,393
Let's do this.

831
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:55,590
You have to have a successful flip,

832
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,540
so for now, you can take off your tiny hands

833
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,373
to get the flip right.

834
00:19:58,373 --> 00:19:59,206
- Seriously?

835
00:19:59,206 --> 00:20:00,039
Oh my goodness. - Yes, I will make

836
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:00,872
one allowance, yes.

837
00:20:00,872 --> 00:20:01,705
- Thank you so much.

838
00:20:01,705 --> 00:20:02,538
- You are so welcome.

839
00:20:02,538 --> 00:20:03,371
You are welcome. - Thank you,

840
00:20:03,371 --> 00:20:04,204
I really appreciate it.

841
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:05,270
Thank you so much, it means a lot, man, thank you.

842
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,468
- So let's get those hands off.

843
00:20:06,468 --> 00:20:08,660
- Oh, it feels good to have my hands back.

844
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,030
Ready, set, go.

845
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:12,380
Oh, oh! - Oh, that looks so good!

846
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,770
You crushed it, bro!

847
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:14,810
You get to comment down below.

848
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:15,643
Who won this round?

849
00:20:15,643 --> 00:20:17,000
And right now, it's on to the next one.

850
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,530
All right, it's time to eat the pancakes,

851
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:20,670
but, there's actually a mystery wheel twist to this.

852
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:23,080
Basically, we can only eat one pancake.

853
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,240
And the mystery wheel gets to choose which pancake that is.

854
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,350
- Now I have to say, all of mine look really tasty,

855
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,860
except Captain Marvel.

856
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:29,693
- What's wrong with her?

857
00:20:29,693 --> 00:20:31,397
- I mean, she has wasabi in her hair, bro.

858
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:32,820
- Oh, dude, I forgot about that.

859
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,183
Three, two, one. - Three, two, one.

860
00:20:34,183 --> 00:20:35,016
(wheels clicking)

861
00:20:35,016 --> 00:20:36,330
Come on, please not the wasabi!

862
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:37,487
Anything but the wasabi, come on!

863
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:39,480
- And as long as mine is not burnt,

864
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,313
I will be very happy.

865
00:20:40,313 --> 00:20:41,650
I've got very low standards on this.

866
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:43,200
- Yes, I got Spider-Man, bro!

867
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,234
- You got Spider-man?

868
00:20:44,234 --> 00:20:45,290
Yo, congratulations, bro. - Yes, I did, check it out.

869
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:46,252
- I'm happy for you.

870
00:20:46,252 --> 00:20:47,085
- Oh, thank you, bro.

871
00:20:47,085 --> 00:20:47,918
Dude, what did you get?

872
00:20:47,918 --> 00:20:48,900
- All right, well, let's see, we got...

873
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,890
Oh! - Oh!

874
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:50,723
Does that mean what I think it means?

875
00:20:50,723 --> 00:20:51,556
- All right, that's kind of cool.

876
00:20:51,556 --> 00:20:53,030
Brother picks my pancake, so I guess--

877
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:53,863
- Yes!

878
00:20:53,863 --> 00:20:54,940
- Devan, you choose one of my pancakes.

879
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:55,773
- What? (record scratches)

880
00:20:55,773 --> 00:20:56,606
No, no, no, no, no.

881
00:20:56,606 --> 00:20:57,439
I'm choosing this one, bro.

882
00:20:57,439 --> 00:20:59,030
- But it says brother picks one of my pancakes.

883
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:01,294
- No, it just says brother picks pancake.

884
00:21:01,294 --> 00:21:02,597
Wasabi for you.

885
00:21:02,597 --> 00:21:03,857
- No, I don't wanna eat the wasabi hair, bro.

886
00:21:03,857 --> 00:21:06,620
- Yes, here we go, time to eat Spider-Man, three,

887
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:07,660
- Dude, his neck's about to fall off.

888
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,563
Two, one.

889
00:21:09,627 --> 00:21:10,780
Mmm! - Oh!

890
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,060
I'm trying to put together a palate,

891
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,190
it starts with the base face,

892
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,530
and then we go with the middle hair,

893
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:16,030
- [Devan] So it's a Captain Marvel sandwich.

894
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:18,080
- All right, here we go, three, two, one.

895
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,240
Oh, oh man, oh man! - Oh, ugh, that's gotta be

896
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,395
a terrible combo.

897
00:21:23,395 --> 00:21:24,228
(Collins groans)

898
00:21:24,228 --> 00:21:25,061
Is that really bad?

899
00:21:25,061 --> 00:21:26,720
- Yeah, it's the worst pancake I've ever had!

900
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,124
It like burns in my nose.

901
00:21:28,124 --> 00:21:29,360
- Oh no!

902
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,193
- Oh man!

903
00:21:30,193 --> 00:21:31,997
- That's gotta be a terrible combo.

904
00:21:31,997 --> 00:21:33,194
(Collins groans)

905
00:21:33,194 --> 00:21:34,027
(ding) (Collins gasps)

906
00:21:34,027 --> 00:21:34,860
- Dude!

907
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,693
When I flip this over, he's gonna have,

908
00:21:35,693 --> 00:21:37,320
like, a metal tooth, and it's gonna give him style,

909
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,560
and flair, and (air whooshing)

910
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,393
dental work.

911
00:21:40,393 --> 00:21:41,560
All right, I'm gonna give him a brown mouth,

912
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,610
'cause he's been eatin' some dirt.

913
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:44,630
I'm sure that, like, elephants might be able to ingest dirt.

914
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:46,340
It's like, a lot of the food they eat is on the ground,

915
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,220
which has a lot of dirt.

916
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,053
- [Devan] Right.

917
00:21:48,053 --> 00:21:48,886
- So, like, they probably know how

918
00:21:48,886 --> 00:21:49,719
to convert dirt into energy.

919
00:21:49,719 --> 00:21:50,552

920
