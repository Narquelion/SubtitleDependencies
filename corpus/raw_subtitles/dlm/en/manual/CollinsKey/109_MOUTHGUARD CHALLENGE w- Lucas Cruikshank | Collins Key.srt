1
00:00:00,195 --> 00:00:01,182
- (Laughs) No.

2
00:00:01,182 --> 00:00:04,387
(lively music)

3
00:00:04,387 --> 00:00:05,220
No, really? No.

4
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,269
(fast speed audio sound)

5
00:00:07,269 --> 00:00:08,102
What's up?

6
00:00:08,102 --> 00:00:09,362
This is Collins Key and as you guys can tell,

7
00:00:09,362 --> 00:00:10,970
I'm in a brand new location today.

8
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:12,381
I've got a pink wall behind me

9
00:00:12,381 --> 00:00:13,788
and you know what?

10
00:00:13,788 --> 00:00:14,754
I also have an empty chair.

11
00:00:14,754 --> 00:00:15,608
So I need somebody to help me out.

12
00:00:15,608 --> 00:00:16,743
So I'm going to please welcome,

13
00:00:16,743 --> 00:00:18,548
my friend, Lucas. (snaps)

14
00:00:18,548 --> 00:00:19,381
- Hey.

15
00:00:19,381 --> 00:00:20,214
- Hey.

16
00:00:20,214 --> 00:00:21,047
- Hey.

17
00:00:21,047 --> 00:00:21,880
- Yes.

18
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:22,713
I was self what?

19
00:00:22,713 --> 00:00:23,546
Just appeared.

20
00:00:23,546 --> 00:00:24,771
- Yeah, where'd you come from bro?

21
00:00:24,771 --> 00:00:25,976
- I came from Subway.

22
00:00:25,976 --> 00:00:26,809
- Subway. (laughs)

23
00:00:26,809 --> 00:00:27,642
Are you fresh?

24
00:00:27,642 --> 00:00:28,475
- I was eatin' lunch.

25
00:00:28,475 --> 00:00:29,549
- (laughs) Yeah, well, hopefully,

26
00:00:29,549 --> 00:00:30,985
you didn't get any food in your teeth because--

27
00:00:30,985 --> 00:00:31,831
- I made sure.

28
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:32,958
- Yeah, yeah, good, yeah.

29
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:34,341
So for today's video, we're going

30
00:00:34,341 --> 00:00:38,511
to be doing, I believe, the dental opener mouth challenge.

31
00:00:38,511 --> 00:00:39,495
Don't quote me if that's the name

32
00:00:39,495 --> 00:00:40,328
of it or not.

33
00:00:40,328 --> 00:00:41,207
We're taking this to the next level.

34
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:42,746
We are doing three rounds.

35
00:00:42,746 --> 00:00:44,332
Round number one is physical.

36
00:00:44,332 --> 00:00:45,165
We're gonna try some different

37
00:00:45,165 --> 00:00:46,734
physical tasks with this giant

38
00:00:46,734 --> 00:00:48,197
mouth opener thing in our mouths.

39
00:00:48,197 --> 00:00:49,030
We look so ridiculous.

40
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:49,863
(Lucas laughs)

41
00:00:49,863 --> 00:00:51,698
Round number two is verbal,

42
00:00:51,698 --> 00:00:53,111
where we're going to be prank calling

43
00:00:53,111 --> 00:00:54,327
some YouTuber's with this thing in our mouth.

44
00:00:54,327 --> 00:00:55,693
And then, round number three,

45
00:00:55,693 --> 00:00:57,512
is going to be a battle of guess the lyric.

46
00:00:57,512 --> 00:00:59,974
And whoever wins the most categories

47
00:00:59,974 --> 00:01:01,962
out of each round, at the end,

48
00:01:01,962 --> 00:01:04,533
gets to hack the loser's Snapchat.

49
00:01:04,533 --> 00:01:05,431
Is how it works.

50
00:01:05,431 --> 00:01:06,346
- It's gonna get real.

51
00:01:06,346 --> 00:01:08,212
- Also we did a video over on Lukas's channel.

52
00:01:08,212 --> 00:01:09,238

the moment they come out.

66
00:01:25,107 --> 00:01:26,748
Also, I'm doing a big giveaway on my channel right now.

67
00:01:26,748 --> 00:01:27,870
I'm giving away a MacBook.

68

So if you guys want to win that.

69
00:01:28,837 --> 00:01:29,670
- Gosh.

70
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:30,503

Are you ready for this?

00:01:36,701 --> 00:01:37,605
- I'm so ready.

77
00:01:37,605 --> 00:01:38,438
- Let's do it.

78
00:01:38,438 --> 00:01:39,271
- Do we just put them on then?

79
00:01:39,271 --> 00:01:40,220
- Yeah, I guess.

80
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,220
How does it?

81
00:01:43,724 --> 00:01:44,968
How does it go?

82
00:01:44,968 --> 00:01:46,209
- Wait, oh, I think I know.

83
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:47,626
You go like this.

84
00:01:48,731 --> 00:01:49,764
- Oh.

85
00:01:49,764 --> 00:01:50,597
- I did it.

86
00:01:50,597 --> 00:01:51,430
- You're good, you're good.

87
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,739
- I got so high.

88
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:53,572
- Oh yeah.

89
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:54,866
- Do I have it on upside down?

90
00:01:54,866 --> 00:01:55,699
- I think so.

91
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:56,607
Let me look it up to make sure

92
00:01:56,607 --> 00:01:58,306
that I put this in right.

93
00:01:58,306 --> 00:02:00,058
Oh God, okay, it goes down, alright.

94
00:02:00,058 --> 00:02:01,437
(bell dings)

95
00:02:01,437 --> 00:02:02,798
- So right over there, I have a list

96
00:02:02,798 --> 00:02:04,186
of everything we are gonna be doing.

97
00:02:04,186 --> 00:02:05,889
So to start off with, we're going to start easy

98
00:02:05,889 --> 00:02:08,246
and we are going to drink a glass of wa.

99
00:02:08,246 --> 00:02:09,086
- Oh no.

100
00:02:09,086 --> 00:02:10,132
- I can't say, of water.

101
00:02:10,132 --> 00:02:11,354
Is David scarce?

102
00:02:11,354 --> 00:02:12,208
- He is.

103
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:13,883
(lively music)

104
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:15,570
- (laughs) No.

105
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:16,792
(laughing)

106
00:02:16,792 --> 00:02:17,625
No.

107
00:02:18,686 --> 00:02:19,519
- My God.

108
00:02:20,527 --> 00:02:22,027
- Look at my nose.

109
00:02:25,992 --> 00:02:27,305
- I'm going to beat you.

110
00:02:27,305 --> 00:02:29,888
(lively music)

111
00:02:30,904 --> 00:02:33,154
(laughing)

112
00:02:35,893 --> 00:02:37,560
- I just spit water.

113
00:02:38,509 --> 00:02:39,692
Alright, I win that one.

114
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:40,525
(bell rings)

115
00:02:40,525 --> 00:02:42,282
For round two, we need to use bubble gum to blow it

116
00:02:42,282 --> 00:02:43,913
and I cannot say a "B" with this stuff in my mouth so.

117
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:47,233
- It definitely looks like we peed our pants.

118
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:48,066
- And here we go.

119
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:49,265
- Okay, three pieces is all I need.

120
00:02:49,265 --> 00:02:50,244
This is easier.

121
00:02:50,244 --> 00:02:51,450
- Yeah, it's a lot easier.

122
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,432
- Okay, I'm going in for the kill.

123
00:02:53,432 --> 00:02:55,182
- Alright, drum roll.

124
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,847
(drum roll)

125
00:02:57,847 --> 00:03:00,921
(laughing)

126
00:03:00,921 --> 00:03:02,921
(blows)

127
00:03:08,774 --> 00:03:09,607
Round two.

128
00:03:09,607 --> 00:03:11,805
We got to call it. (laughs)

129
00:03:11,805 --> 00:03:12,910
Alright, round two was a draw.

130
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:13,743
(beep)

131
00:03:13,743 --> 00:03:14,576
You're not the winner.

132
00:03:14,576 --> 00:03:15,549
Round number two includes bubbles

133
00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:17,668
but now, we have to, actually, blow bubbles.

134
00:03:17,668 --> 00:03:18,568
- Blow the bubbles with the mouth.

135
00:03:18,568 --> 00:03:19,637
- It should be easier, alright.

136
00:03:19,637 --> 00:03:20,942
- Without lips.

137
00:03:20,942 --> 00:03:23,003
Well alright, let's do this.

138
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:24,167
- Let's do this, okay.

139
00:03:24,167 --> 00:03:25,606
Whoever can do it first wins this round so.

140
00:03:25,606 --> 00:03:29,097
Oh I hate this weird, soapy stuff.

141
00:03:29,097 --> 00:03:29,930
- I know.

142
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,079
(laughing)

143
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:32,764
(breathing)

144
00:03:32,764 --> 00:03:35,291
(laughing)

145
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:38,084
(breathing)

146
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:40,365
(laughing)

147
00:03:40,365 --> 00:03:41,198
- It's just that I had to have

148
00:03:41,198 --> 00:03:42,430
an asthma attack to do it.

149
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,722
(laughing)

150
00:03:43,722 --> 00:03:44,692
- Oh, you win that round.

151
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:45,566
You won that.

152
00:03:45,566 --> 00:03:46,399
- You blew before me though.

153
00:03:46,399 --> 00:03:47,802
- I don't think so, no.

154
00:03:47,802 --> 00:03:48,635
- I was out.

155
00:03:48,635 --> 00:03:49,595
- I was going to be nice, okay.

156
00:03:49,595 --> 00:03:50,428
- Oh no.

157
00:03:50,428 --> 00:03:51,261
- Okay, I'll take it.

158
00:03:51,261 --> 00:03:52,094
- I think you got it first.

159
00:03:52,094 --> 00:03:54,590
Final category of the physical round,

160
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,507
is we need to, oh gosh.

161
00:03:57,511 --> 00:03:58,754
- Oh God.

162
00:03:58,754 --> 00:03:59,991
- We need to blow a balloon.

163
00:03:59,991 --> 00:04:00,824
- I can do it.

164
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:02,327
I believe in myself.

165
00:04:02,327 --> 00:04:03,812
- Alright, here we go so.

166
00:04:03,812 --> 00:04:05,145
Three, two, one.

167
00:04:09,163 --> 00:04:11,330
(blowing)

168
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:18,389
(laughing)

169
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,272
- How'd you do that?

170
00:04:21,272 --> 00:04:23,649
- (Laughs) I can't do it.

171
00:04:23,649 --> 00:04:25,387
Okay, another draw.

172
00:04:25,387 --> 00:04:26,244
I'm going to get a light head.

173
00:04:26,244 --> 00:04:27,847
I'm gonna. (laughs)

174
00:04:27,847 --> 00:04:29,358
- No, no, I can feel a pass out coming.

175
00:04:29,358 --> 00:04:30,544
(laughing)

176
00:04:30,544 --> 00:04:32,000
- I feel a little light headed right now.

177
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,150
(slow motion) I feel a little light headed right now.

178
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:37,427
That was the end of the first round

179
00:04:37,427 --> 00:04:40,280
which was physical and we are both tied with one point.

180
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,933
- One-to-One.

181
00:04:41,933 --> 00:04:43,956
- Going to the next round, verbal.

182
00:04:43,956 --> 00:04:45,659
(bell dings)

183
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:46,878
For this round, you have to say

184
00:04:46,878 --> 00:04:48,913
a tongue twister of your choice.

185
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:52,057
Do you know any tongue twisters?

186
00:04:52,057 --> 00:04:52,890
I think I do.

187
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:57,184
Sally sells seashells on the shore at Sunday.

188
00:04:57,184 --> 00:04:58,017
I think I did it.

189
00:04:58,017 --> 00:04:58,850
- Sounds good, okay.

190
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:01,501
Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.

191
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:02,807
(laughing)

192
00:05:02,807 --> 00:05:05,895
A peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked,

193
00:05:05,895 --> 00:05:08,626
if Peter Piper picked a pair of pickled peppers,

194
00:05:08,626 --> 00:05:12,829
where is the peck of pickled pepper Peter Piper picked?

195
00:05:12,829 --> 00:05:13,756
You win that one.

196
00:05:13,756 --> 00:05:14,589
- That was hard.

197
00:05:14,589 --> 00:05:15,909
- That was hard but you win that one.

198
00:05:15,909 --> 00:05:16,742
- Oh my God.

199
00:05:16,742 --> 00:05:18,652
I'm in the lead, not trying to brag.

200
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:19,485
- The next round is going to be

201
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,973
one of my personal favorites and we both

202
00:05:20,973 --> 00:05:22,988
are going to prank call a YouTuber

203
00:05:22,988 --> 00:05:26,703
and see how long we can last without laughing.

204
00:05:26,703 --> 00:05:27,641
- Without laughing?

205
00:05:27,641 --> 00:05:28,571
- Without laughing.

206
00:05:28,571 --> 00:05:30,055
- Okay, I'm gonna call my little brother.

207
00:05:30,055 --> 00:05:30,888
- Okay.

208
00:05:30,888 --> 00:05:31,721
- He's a YouTuber.

209
00:05:31,721 --> 00:05:32,590
- Alright.

210
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:33,423
- Let's see here.

211
00:05:33,423 --> 00:05:35,547
I'm gonna call Jacob Cook.

212
00:05:35,547 --> 00:05:36,726
I got in a car accident.

213
00:05:36,726 --> 00:05:39,143
On a, I'll try, on a bicycle.

214
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:42,889
- [Jacob] Hello.

215
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:44,835
- Hey, what's up?

216
00:05:44,835 --> 00:05:48,275
I'm home because, you know how I got a dike,

217
00:05:48,275 --> 00:05:49,608
I got a icecale?

218
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:55,672
I got in a wreck and I bumped into a guy

219
00:05:55,672 --> 00:05:59,339
on the sidewalk and now the icecal's ruined.

220
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:06,095
Now the icicle's ruined. (laughs)

221
00:06:10,335 --> 00:06:11,624
I made it to 50 seconds.

222
00:06:11,624 --> 00:06:12,457
- That was 50 seconds.

223
00:06:12,457 --> 00:06:13,518
- Hey Jacob, I'm doing a video

224
00:06:13,518 --> 00:06:16,248
with Collins Key and I had to prank call you.

225
00:06:16,248 --> 00:06:17,581
- Yo, what's up?

226
00:06:21,941 --> 00:06:24,407
(laughing)

227
00:06:24,407 --> 00:06:25,240
- No but we're wearing a dental thing.

228
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,740
- That's so funny.

229
00:06:28,798 --> 00:06:31,048
(laughing)

230
00:06:32,343 --> 00:06:35,345
(slow motion laughing)

231
00:06:35,345 --> 00:06:38,262
Alright well, peace out little bra.

232
00:06:39,496 --> 00:06:40,329
Bye.

233
00:06:40,329 --> 00:06:41,162
- Later.

234
00:06:41,162 --> 00:06:41,995
- I lasted 50 seconds.

235
00:06:41,995 --> 00:06:43,469
- 50 seconds, okay, so I got 50 seconds.

236
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:44,302
So let's see.

237
00:06:44,302 --> 00:06:47,133
Okay, let me call one of the Marrow twins.

238
00:06:47,133 --> 00:06:48,177
I'm going to say I got in a fight.

239
00:06:48,177 --> 00:06:49,085
- Oh a fight.

240
00:06:49,085 --> 00:06:49,918
- Yeah.

241
00:06:51,222 --> 00:06:52,630
Okay.

242
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:55,297
- Hey, I got a question for you.

243
00:06:56,702 --> 00:06:59,602
- I was filming a video, (mumbles)

244
00:06:59,602 --> 00:07:01,286
and we were getting on this really funny thing

245
00:07:01,286 --> 00:07:03,562
where we got in a big fight.

246
00:07:03,562 --> 00:07:08,071
But he, actually, ended up punching me in the face.

247
00:07:08,071 --> 00:07:10,803
- I left the room for a second,

248
00:07:10,803 --> 00:07:13,184
cuz I don't really know what to do.

249
00:07:13,184 --> 00:07:16,764
- Yeah, I think he knocked out a tooth or something.

250
00:07:16,764 --> 00:07:19,181
- Yeah, it was pretty gnarly.

251
00:07:23,574 --> 00:07:24,407
- Yeah.

252
00:07:29,119 --> 00:07:31,036
- No it's not, so like.

253
00:07:32,064 --> 00:07:32,897
(Lucas laughs)

254
00:07:32,897 --> 00:07:33,745
- Now I'm drooling, no.

255
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:36,912
Okay, sorry, I was just doing a video.

256
00:07:38,288 --> 00:07:39,508
- Yeah.

257
00:07:39,508 --> 00:07:40,341
I'm gonna pass out cuz

258
00:07:40,341 --> 00:07:41,840
I'm, literally, drooling right now.

259
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,183
I feel like, okay, I got to take it out.

260
00:07:43,183 --> 00:07:44,063
The dental mouth thing.

261
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:46,598
I'm did a prank call for.

262
00:07:46,598 --> 00:07:48,181
I'm so sorry, yeah.

263
00:07:49,417 --> 00:07:51,500
(laughs)

264
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:56,933
Thank you for being cool and awesome.

265
00:07:56,933 --> 00:07:57,766
(laughing)

266
00:07:57,766 --> 00:07:58,599
- [Vanessa] Okay.

267
00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:00,490
- Alright, cool, talk to you later.

268
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:01,439
- Alright, bye.

269
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,532
I think I lasted a tiny bit.

270
00:08:02,532 --> 00:08:03,638
That was, I think.

271
00:08:03,638 --> 00:08:04,471
- You lasted longer.

272
00:08:04,471 --> 00:08:05,304
- A little bit longer, okay.

273
00:08:05,304 --> 00:08:07,016
- So I couldn't say bicycle.

274
00:08:07,016 --> 00:08:08,660
(laughing)

275
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,988
(mumbles) so hard are the Bs.

276
00:08:09,988 --> 00:08:11,734
So, we are tied again. (bell dings)

277
00:08:11,734 --> 00:08:12,567
- Are we actually?

278
00:08:12,567 --> 00:08:13,400
- We are tied again.

279
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,062
So this is coming down to the final round

280
00:08:15,062 --> 00:08:18,837
and the final round is guess the lyric.

281
00:08:18,837 --> 00:08:20,539
(bell dings)

282
00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:22,878
- We pick a song and then we have to sing it?

283
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:23,922
- Sing it or you can talk it.

284
00:08:23,922 --> 00:08:25,279
Cuz I'm a horrible singer.

285
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:26,418
If you can sing, go for it.

286
00:08:26,418 --> 00:08:27,251
Sing your heart out.

287
00:08:27,251 --> 00:08:28,459
- I can't sing but I do it.

288
00:08:28,459 --> 00:08:30,887
- Then do it, go for it.

289
00:08:30,887 --> 00:08:31,720
- Yeah.

290
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,553
You go first.

291
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:33,386
- Oh, I have an idea.

292
00:08:33,386 --> 00:08:34,219
- Okay.

293
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:35,752
♫ Close the hair tie (laughs)

294
00:08:35,752 --> 00:08:36,585
You know, like.

296
00:08:38,545 --> 00:08:39,801
- Sweatshirt, with Jacob Sartorius.

297
00:08:39,801 --> 00:08:42,381
(laughing)

298
00:08:42,381 --> 00:08:46,054
- Wait a second, I get to play or you do?

299
00:08:46,054 --> 00:08:46,887
- (laughs) I think you get to play.

300
00:08:46,887 --> 00:08:47,720
(bell dings)

301
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,553
Cuz you sang it correctly (mumbles)

302
00:08:48,553 --> 00:08:49,555
- Yeah.

303
00:08:49,555 --> 00:08:51,290
- You see me at work, work, work, work.

304
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:53,718
You see me do my dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt.

305
00:08:53,718 --> 00:08:54,551

306
00:08:54,551 --> 00:08:55,391
- Yeah.

307
00:08:55,391 --> 00:08:56,567
(laughing)

308
00:08:56,567 --> 00:08:57,442
I didn't do anything.

309
00:08:57,442 --> 00:08:58,592
I just had to, literally, just like.

310
00:08:58,592 --> 00:08:59,710
- I know, you can't understand what you're really saying.

311
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:01,680
- I saw you at work, work, work, work, work.

312
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,821
You see me do my dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt.

313
00:09:03,821 --> 00:09:04,654
- You nailed it.

314
00:09:04,654 --> 00:09:05,487
- Alright, cool.

315
00:09:05,487 --> 00:09:06,320
So I go first.

316
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,157
I'll just keep going, don't you think?

317
00:09:07,157 --> 00:09:08,065
- Keep going, okay.

318
00:09:08,065 --> 00:09:11,748
♫ My mamma don't like you and she likes everyone.

319
00:09:11,748 --> 00:09:12,784
- Love Yourself.

320
00:09:12,784 --> 00:09:14,328
♫ And I never liked you.

321
00:09:14,328 --> 00:09:15,161
- Is it Love Yourself?

322
00:09:15,161 --> 00:09:15,994
- Oh yeah.

323
00:09:15,994 --> 00:09:16,827
- Yeah, Love Yourself, Justin.

324
00:09:16,827 --> 00:09:17,674
I got you New York.

325
00:09:17,674 --> 00:09:19,521
♫ Nugget, biscuit, nugget in a biscuit.

326
00:09:19,521 --> 00:09:21,458
♫ Nugget, biscuit, nugget in a biscuit.

327
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,427
♫ Nugget, biscuit, nugget in a biscuit.

328
00:09:23,427 --> 00:09:25,391
♫ Do you like mashed potatoes

329
00:09:25,391 --> 00:09:29,265
♫ Do you like mashed potatoes

330
00:09:29,265 --> 00:09:30,206
- Cake By The Ocean?

331
00:09:30,206 --> 00:09:31,039
- No. (laughs)

332
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:32,378
(beeps)

333
00:09:32,378 --> 00:09:35,719
No, I just sang a old Tobuscus song.

334
00:09:35,719 --> 00:09:37,113
Called Nugget, Biscuit, Nugget in a.

335
00:09:37,113 --> 00:09:38,363
- I didn't know it.

336
00:09:38,363 --> 00:09:39,265
- Okay.

337
00:09:39,265 --> 00:09:40,214
- You lose.

338
00:09:40,214 --> 00:09:41,127
- I lose, no.

339
00:09:41,127 --> 00:09:42,278
- No wait, oh.

340
00:09:42,278 --> 00:09:43,491
- No, I lose, okay.

341
00:09:43,491 --> 00:09:44,324
- Oh.

342
00:09:44,324 --> 00:09:45,340
- Alright, I guess.

343
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,173
(slow motion) Oh.

344
00:09:46,173 --> 00:09:47,272
- Alright, I guess.

345
00:09:47,272 --> 00:09:48,882
I think Luke is the one.

346
00:09:48,882 --> 00:09:49,715
- I won it?

347
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:52,035

351
00:09:56,066 --> 00:09:57,578
- Yeah, so he gets to hack my Snapchat.

352
00:09:57,578 --> 00:09:59,275
- I get to hack your Snapchat?

353
00:09:59,275 --> 00:10:00,217
- Yes.

354
00:10:00,217 --> 00:10:01,800
- Hey it's Collins.

355
00:10:02,742 --> 00:10:03,834
