1
00:00:00,238 --> 00:00:03,446
- This one's either vomit or fruity, fruity something.

2
00:00:03,446 --> 00:00:04,325
(retching) (signal tone)

3
00:00:04,325 --> 00:00:06,107
What's up, it's Collins Key and for today's video,

4
00:00:06,107 --> 00:00:07,877
I need a very special guest to join me,

5
00:00:07,877 --> 00:00:09,714
so everyone please welcome my little brother,

6
00:00:09,714 --> 00:00:10,547
Devon Key.

7
00:00:10,547 --> 00:00:11,380
- [Both] Hey!

8
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:12,213
- What's up.

9
00:00:12,213 --> 00:00:13,868
- What's up, bro? - Not wand, but two wands.

10
00:00:13,868 --> 00:00:15,074
- I got two wands. - And a map.

11
00:00:15,074 --> 00:00:17,114
- One for the spells, for the...

12
00:00:17,114 --> 00:00:17,947
Yeah.

13
00:00:17,947 --> 00:00:18,780
- Here you go. - Thank you very much.

14
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:19,613
This one's actually my wand.

15
00:00:19,613 --> 00:00:20,446
One of you guys actually sent me this,

16
00:00:20,446 --> 00:00:21,309
so huge shout out to you.

17
00:00:21,309 --> 00:00:22,772
But for today's video, Devon and I,

18
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:24,556
we're gonna be trying.

19
00:00:24,556 --> 00:00:26,106
Today we're gonna be trying a whole bunch of

20
00:00:26,106 --> 00:00:27,371
Harry Potter candy

21
00:00:27,371 --> 00:00:29,711
and if you want me to do even testing videos with Devon,

22
00:00:29,711 --> 00:00:31,414
let me know by liking this video

23
00:00:31,414 --> 00:00:33,231
and if this video gets enough thumbs up,

24
00:00:33,231 --> 00:00:34,189
then you know what?

25
00:00:34,189 --> 00:00:35,022
We will do more videos

26
00:00:35,022 --> 00:00:36,144
where we test out different things.

27
00:00:36,144 --> 00:00:37,987
- Please, please thumbs it up.

28
00:00:37,987 --> 00:00:38,820
- Why?

29
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:39,804
You wanna be in more videos or you want to eat candy?

30
00:00:39,804 --> 00:00:40,946
- I wanna do more candy videos.

31
00:00:40,946 --> 00:00:43,332
- All we're missing now is just the Harry Potter candies

32
00:00:43,332 --> 00:00:44,165
so--

33
00:00:44,165 --> 00:00:46,253
- So I need to make him apparate in Hogwarts.

34
00:00:46,253 --> 00:00:47,086
- Okay.

35
00:00:47,086 --> 00:00:48,838
- So first, I would have as much magical power as you do.

36
00:00:48,838 --> 00:00:49,993
(laughing) So (grunting).

37
00:00:49,993 --> 00:00:51,569
Alright, let's see what he finds.

38
00:00:51,569 --> 00:00:55,319
(whimsical orchestral music)

39
00:01:18,756 --> 00:01:20,196
- Whoa, geez.

40
00:01:20,196 --> 00:01:21,029
Alright, well I just got--

41
00:01:21,029 --> 00:01:22,386
- You startled me so bad.

42
00:01:22,386 --> 00:01:23,219
- (Laughing) Sorry man.

43
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:24,841
Bro, we've got a lot of candy in here

44
00:01:24,841 --> 00:01:26,023
but before we do this, there's one more thing

45
00:01:26,023 --> 00:01:28,124
and that is that I'm doing a giveaway this month

46
00:01:28,124 --> 00:01:28,957
here on my channel.

47
00:01:28,957 --> 00:01:30,274
I'm giving away a Macbook computer.

48
00:01:30,274 --> 00:01:31,389
If you wanna win that,

49
00:01:31,389 --> 00:01:32,909
let us know by liking this video.

00:01:39,889 --> 00:01:41,554

00:01:41,554 --> 00:01:42,574
Add us on Snapchat.

Snapcodes right over there.

59
00:01:43,802 --> 00:01:44,635
Now we've done...

60
00:01:44,635 --> 00:01:46,265
You almost hit me in the face.

61
00:01:46,265 --> 00:01:47,171
(laughter)

62
00:01:47,171 --> 00:01:48,004
Without any further adieu,

63
00:01:48,004 --> 00:01:49,510
let's jump right into the video.

64
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:52,963
Or actually, let's apparate right into the video.

65
00:01:52,963 --> 00:01:53,796
- We're here.

66
00:01:53,796 --> 00:01:54,678
Alright. (both laughing)

67
00:01:54,678 --> 00:01:55,824
Lowkey, I cannot even tell you guys

68
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,617
how excited I am for this video.

69
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:58,767
- I can't wait.

70
00:01:58,767 --> 00:02:00,087
- Because the moment I found out

71
00:02:00,087 --> 00:02:01,234
there was actually Harry Potter candy,

72
00:02:01,234 --> 00:02:02,534
I was like I have to try this stuff.

73
00:02:02,534 --> 00:02:03,913
So to start this off, we're gonna be trying

74
00:02:03,913 --> 00:02:05,747
Chocolate Frogs right now.

75
00:02:05,747 --> 00:02:06,580
You gotta know from the books,

76
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,958
every time you get a chocolate frog,

77
00:02:07,958 --> 00:02:09,153
you get a wizard card inside of it,

78
00:02:09,153 --> 00:02:09,986
so who'd you get?

79
00:02:09,986 --> 00:02:11,252
That's the real question.

80
00:02:11,252 --> 00:02:12,840
Gods of Gryffindor, nice.

81
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,673
Bro, who did I get?

82
00:02:13,673 --> 00:02:14,506
- I literally got this one.

83
00:02:14,506 --> 00:02:15,417
- Hey, I got (unclear).

84
00:02:15,417 --> 00:02:16,250
Yo.

85
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,083
Now time for the chocolate frog.

86
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:20,118
This looks like a frog that's made out of chocolate.

87
00:02:20,118 --> 00:02:21,703
How do you open it so fast?

88
00:02:21,703 --> 00:02:23,174
- It's so heavy too.

89
00:02:23,174 --> 00:02:24,007
- I know.

90
00:02:24,007 --> 00:02:25,713
- I'm actually gonna go in for a little foot.

91
00:02:25,713 --> 00:02:26,546
- I'm going straight for the head.

92
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:28,711
Go for it, three, two, one, go.

93
00:02:28,711 --> 00:02:29,544
- That foot was good.

94
00:02:29,544 --> 00:02:31,141
- Oh.

95
00:02:31,141 --> 00:02:32,724
It's all chocolate.

96
00:02:33,888 --> 00:02:36,138
- That's a lot of chocolate right there.

97
00:02:36,138 --> 00:02:37,612
(grunting)

98
00:02:37,612 --> 00:02:38,564
That's real good.

99
00:02:38,564 --> 00:02:39,869
- Wow these are delicious.

100
00:02:39,869 --> 00:02:41,596
(growling)

101
00:02:41,596 --> 00:02:42,870
I have a dentist appointment tomorrow.

102
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,459
Man, I'm gonna be so messed up.

103
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:47,011
(garbled) Chocolate frog.

104
00:02:47,011 --> 00:02:49,060
Next up, we've got Exploding Bon Bons.

105
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,711
And I am literally expecting explosions on this one.

106
00:02:52,711 --> 00:02:53,698
(laughter)

107
00:02:53,698 --> 00:02:54,531
There we go.

108
00:02:54,531 --> 00:02:56,144
(both whooping)

109
00:02:56,144 --> 00:02:57,941
So take a bon bon, Devon.

110
00:02:57,941 --> 00:02:59,009
I'm gonna go for this one here.

111
00:02:59,009 --> 00:02:59,868
Like I said, guys.

112
00:02:59,868 --> 00:03:01,003
If this explodes in my mouth,

113
00:03:01,003 --> 00:03:01,836
ten out of ten.

114
00:03:01,836 --> 00:03:03,380
Ooh, it smells delicious.

115
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,493
Alright, three, two, one, go.

116
00:03:04,493 --> 00:03:05,326
(gasping)

117
00:03:05,326 --> 00:03:06,159
It was nothing.

118
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:06,992
- Good though.

119
00:03:06,992 --> 00:03:07,825
They're really good.

120
00:03:07,825 --> 00:03:08,658
It's popping.

121
00:03:08,658 --> 00:03:09,491
- It's popping?

122
00:03:09,491 --> 00:03:11,148
- There's a bit of popping in my mouth right now.

123
00:03:11,148 --> 00:03:11,997
- Well I swallowed mine already.

124
00:03:11,997 --> 00:03:13,309
- It's actually popping.

125
00:03:13,309 --> 00:03:15,086
- Then it is kinda exploding.

126
00:03:15,086 --> 00:03:17,756
Perfect ten out of ten.

127
00:03:17,756 --> 00:03:19,068
I can hear it, bro.

128
00:03:19,068 --> 00:03:20,562
So for this one,

129
00:03:20,562 --> 00:03:22,425
we have Mad Eye Moody Eye Balls.

130
00:03:22,425 --> 00:03:23,258
Is that what they're called?

131
00:03:23,258 --> 00:03:24,091
Eye balls.

132
00:03:24,091 --> 00:03:25,341
- Eyeball Bonanza.

133
00:03:25,341 --> 00:03:27,207
- Bonanza (laughing).

134
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,228
These are huge.

135
00:03:28,228 --> 00:03:29,166
Look at this.

136
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:30,234
- Oh my god.

137
00:03:30,234 --> 00:03:31,067
Give me yours for one second.

138
00:03:31,067 --> 00:03:32,073
(yelling)

139
00:03:32,073 --> 00:03:32,906
Alright here we go.

140
00:03:32,906 --> 00:03:33,739
- Nasty.

141
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:36,135
- Three, two, one, go.

142
00:03:36,135 --> 00:03:37,285
(chokes)

143
00:03:37,285 --> 00:03:38,219
- You're gonna choke.

144
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:39,052
- Yeah for real.

145
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,892
- I don't know what you do.

146
00:03:40,892 --> 00:03:43,142
(laughing)

147
00:03:44,584 --> 00:03:45,417
Are these edible?

148
00:03:45,417 --> 00:03:47,065
- I think they're candy.

149
00:03:47,065 --> 00:03:48,342
What if they're not?

150
00:03:48,342 --> 00:03:49,175
- Ow.

151
00:03:50,149 --> 00:03:51,253
I smacked my tooth.

152
00:03:51,253 --> 00:03:52,086
- Ow!

153
00:03:52,086 --> 00:03:53,464
I don't think this is edible.

154
00:03:53,464 --> 00:03:55,392
- I hope no kids have choked on this.

155
00:03:55,392 --> 00:03:56,895
- I don't think a kid could fit this in their mouth, bro.

156
00:03:56,895 --> 00:03:58,009
This thing is pretty huge.

157
00:03:58,009 --> 00:03:59,431
Okay, so the eyeballs are a fail.

158
00:03:59,431 --> 00:04:01,776
You can't do anything with these.

159
00:04:01,776 --> 00:04:02,609
- Don't.

160
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,404
You're gonna crack a tooth.

161
00:04:04,404 --> 00:04:05,694
Alright, yeah, eyeballs are a fail.

162
00:04:05,694 --> 00:04:06,527
Moving on to the next one.

163
00:04:06,527 --> 00:04:07,682
Next up is our personal favorite,

164
00:04:07,682 --> 00:04:10,875
Bertie Bott's Eery Flavor Beans.

165
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,346
Oh no, I just dropped my beans.

166
00:04:12,346 --> 00:04:13,551
I literally spilled the beans.

167
00:04:13,551 --> 00:04:14,604
I'm gonna go for a gamble on mine.

168
00:04:14,604 --> 00:04:19,346
This one's either vomit or fruity, fruity something.

169
00:04:19,346 --> 00:04:21,596
(retching)

170
00:04:23,993 --> 00:04:25,840
- It's all good here.

171
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,922
It tastes like bubble gum.

172
00:04:26,922 --> 00:04:27,755
- Let's do this, bro.

173
00:04:27,755 --> 00:04:28,703
You wanna do a handful?

174
00:04:28,703 --> 00:04:29,745
- Alright, I'm down.

175
00:04:29,745 --> 00:04:30,651
- Here we go.

176
00:04:30,651 --> 00:04:33,303
A handful of Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.

177
00:04:33,303 --> 00:04:34,464
Here we go, you ready?

178
00:04:34,464 --> 00:04:36,131
Three, two, one, go.

179
00:04:38,771 --> 00:04:40,208
- So many beans.

180
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:41,041
Oh god.

181
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:45,453
(retching)

182
00:04:45,453 --> 00:04:46,286
(whooping)

183
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,310
(unintelligible speech)

184
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:52,851
I feel like I got all the bad ones at once.

185
00:04:52,851 --> 00:04:55,750
(retching)

186
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,583
- Bye, bye.

187
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:59,131
For this one here, we've got Chocolate Cauldrons.

188
00:04:59,131 --> 00:05:01,792
So basically, we're practically in Snape's class right now.

189
00:05:01,792 --> 00:05:03,930
Advanced potions and how do you get it out

190
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,126
is the real question.

191
00:05:05,126 --> 00:05:05,959
- I don't know.

192
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:06,792
- Grab it? - I'm just dumping it.

193
00:05:06,792 --> 00:05:07,625
- Alright.

194
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:08,664
Yo these are huge.

195
00:05:08,664 --> 00:05:09,497
- Can you open...no.

196
00:05:09,497 --> 00:05:10,330
- I don't think so. - No.

197
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:11,163
- Let's take a bite.

198
00:05:11,163 --> 00:05:11,996
You ready, three.

199
00:05:11,996 --> 00:05:12,829
- I don't know where to begin.

200
00:05:12,829 --> 00:05:13,669
- I don't know, two.

201
00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:15,883
I'm going for the top, one go.

202
00:05:15,883 --> 00:05:18,248
(grunting)

203
00:05:18,248 --> 00:05:19,081
- Wow.

204
00:05:19,081 --> 00:05:20,660
- You took a bit in the middle of it?

205
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,516
Oh my god.

206
00:05:21,516 --> 00:05:22,349
- Success.

207
00:05:22,349 --> 00:05:23,182
Wow.

208
00:05:23,182 --> 00:05:24,349
That was good.

209
00:05:26,635 --> 00:05:27,581
The top is...

210
00:05:27,581 --> 00:05:28,414
Whoa.

211
00:05:28,414 --> 00:05:30,237
- M hm, that's marshmellows.

212
00:05:30,237 --> 00:05:32,123
- They're like marshmellows on the top.

213
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:33,110
Okay.

214
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:33,943
So the chocolate.

215
00:05:33,943 --> 00:05:34,842
(coughing)

216
00:05:34,842 --> 00:05:36,148
The Chocolate Cauldron.

217
00:05:36,148 --> 00:05:37,007
- Thumbs up.

218
00:05:37,007 --> 00:05:38,307
- Yeah.

219
00:05:38,307 --> 00:05:41,165
This next one we're gonna be eating, some newts.

220
00:05:41,165 --> 00:05:41,998
(laughter) I don't what they are

221
00:05:41,998 --> 00:05:43,856
but they remind me of a newt.

222
00:05:43,856 --> 00:05:44,689
And I don't really know what a newt is.

223
00:05:44,689 --> 00:05:45,600
It just seems fitting.

224
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,668
This is a newt.

225
00:05:46,668 --> 00:05:47,829
Alright, here we go.

226
00:05:47,829 --> 00:05:49,167
Oh there's a secondary layer of wrapping around them.

227
00:05:49,167 --> 00:05:50,790
- Ah gosh. - They got me.

228
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,516
- They really don't want you to eat this.

229
00:05:52,516 --> 00:05:53,349
- No.

230
00:05:57,033 --> 00:05:57,866
- Wow.

231
00:05:57,866 --> 00:05:58,699
- Tap newts on three.

232
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:00,623
One, two, three, tap a newt.

233
00:06:00,623 --> 00:06:02,744
(laughter) You try to bite it?

234
00:06:02,744 --> 00:06:04,994
Your teeth got stuck to it.

235
00:06:07,077 --> 00:06:07,936
- It's pretty good.

236
00:06:07,936 --> 00:06:08,769
- Mine's like a banana.

237
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:09,764
Mine tastes and looks like a banana.

238
00:06:09,764 --> 00:06:10,597
- Eyeball's the best part.

239
00:06:10,597 --> 00:06:11,597
- Oh really?

240
00:06:12,632 --> 00:06:13,510
(grunts)

241
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,600
Yes so these newts are a win.

242
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,549
Yay. - Yeah.

243
00:06:16,549 --> 00:06:18,717
- These next ones are called Acid Pops.

244
00:06:18,717 --> 00:06:19,550
Hopefully we don't die.

245
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:22,133
- These things have salt on it.

246
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:24,818
Ah, oh.

247
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:25,677
It's sour.

248
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:26,777
- Yeah, but it's not like...

249
00:06:26,777 --> 00:06:28,205
It's not warhead sour.

250
00:06:28,205 --> 00:06:29,594
- They're toxic waste sorry.

251
00:06:29,594 --> 00:06:31,123
- That's another level of sour.

252
00:06:31,123 --> 00:06:31,956
I can't tell if I like it or not.

253
00:06:31,956 --> 00:06:34,359
It's like a green apple almost.

254
00:06:34,359 --> 00:06:35,393
Oh!

255
00:06:35,393 --> 00:06:36,751
(retching)

256
00:06:36,751 --> 00:06:38,562
If you put the tip of your tongue on it,

257
00:06:38,562 --> 00:06:39,395
it hurts.

258
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:43,003
Ow!

259
00:06:44,419 --> 00:06:45,919
No, just leave it.

260
00:06:49,052 --> 00:06:49,885
You don't feel anything?

261
00:06:49,885 --> 00:06:50,718
(laughing)

262
00:06:50,718 --> 00:06:51,551
- No. - It hurt my tongue.

263
00:06:51,551 --> 00:06:54,092
Maybe I've got a defect one.

264
00:06:54,092 --> 00:06:55,275
The wizards messed up on this one.

265
00:06:55,275 --> 00:06:56,108
Elves didn't make it right.

266
00:06:56,108 --> 00:06:58,491
Yeah, so the Acid Pops, yeah, these are definitely,

267
00:06:58,491 --> 00:06:59,382
these are a win, I like these.

268
00:06:59,382 --> 00:07:01,716
These ones are Jelly Slugs.

269
00:07:01,716 --> 00:07:02,560
- Give it here, boy.

270
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,579
- You're excited for these?

271
00:07:03,579 --> 00:07:04,412
- Yeah.

272
00:07:04,412 --> 00:07:05,245
- Oh my gosh.

273
00:07:05,245 --> 00:07:06,269
(gasping)

274
00:07:06,269 --> 00:07:07,419
- These are so cool.

275
00:07:07,419 --> 00:07:10,051
- These are so bizarre.

276
00:07:10,051 --> 00:07:10,884
- I'm gonna eat it like Ron did.

277
00:07:10,884 --> 00:07:12,535
- Ready?

278
00:07:12,535 --> 00:07:13,638
- That's just fun.

279
00:07:13,638 --> 00:07:14,575
- These are so chewy.

280
00:07:14,575 --> 00:07:17,663
These are the most chewy candy I've ever had.

281
00:07:17,663 --> 00:07:18,496
- I like these.

282
00:07:18,496 --> 00:07:20,830
- I'm gonna do it like Devon.

283
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,288
I can't even do it.

284
00:07:22,288 --> 00:07:23,232
- I'm going two at a time, son.

285
00:07:23,232 --> 00:07:24,065
- Wow.

286
00:07:28,213 --> 00:07:31,414
- Hold up, there's one at the top of the box.

287
00:07:31,414 --> 00:07:32,613
These ones are good.

288
00:07:32,613 --> 00:07:34,078
- Mine are delicious.

289
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:34,911
- Weird texture.

290
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,663
And the one you've all been waiting for,

291
00:07:36,663 --> 00:07:39,659
the magic wand made out of chocolate.

292
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:40,613
So I mean, if you cannot become a wizard,

293
00:07:40,613 --> 00:07:43,039
you might as well ingest what wizards use.

294
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:43,872
That made no sense.

295
00:07:43,872 --> 00:07:44,859
(laughter)

296
00:07:44,859 --> 00:07:45,692
- I don't know. - The wands.

297
00:07:45,692 --> 00:07:46,525
- Their wands.

298
00:07:46,525 --> 00:07:47,358
Yo. - Ooh.

299
00:07:48,706 --> 00:07:51,539
- Straight up, this looks amazing.

300
00:07:53,115 --> 00:07:54,053
Oh my gosh.

301
00:07:54,053 --> 00:07:55,446
- This looks like a wand.

302
00:07:55,446 --> 00:07:57,029
- Expecto Petrotem.

303
00:07:59,981 --> 00:08:03,648
(both humming in enjoyment)

304
00:08:15,806 --> 00:08:17,327
I am now a wizard!

305
00:08:17,327 --> 00:08:19,557
When you don't get your Hogwarts acceptance letter.

306
00:08:19,557 --> 00:08:20,390
(laughing)

307
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,223
Alright.

308
00:08:21,223 --> 00:08:22,117
(unintelligible speech)

309
00:08:22,117 --> 00:08:23,321
With these ones, I'm not exactly sure

310
00:08:23,321 --> 00:08:24,876
how they tie in with Harry Potter

311
00:08:24,876 --> 00:08:25,988
besides the fact they have

312
00:08:25,988 --> 00:08:27,227
the Harry Potter logo on the back of them.

313
00:08:27,227 --> 00:08:28,060
(laughter)

314
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,274
Apparently, these were some sort of Harry Potter thing

315
00:08:30,274 --> 00:08:32,114
or maybe they were just literally black licorice.

316
00:08:32,114 --> 00:08:34,665
But we're gonna try this out right now,

317
00:08:34,665 --> 00:08:36,814
see if there's anything magical about it.

318
00:08:36,814 --> 00:08:37,913
- Whoa.

319
00:08:37,913 --> 00:08:38,746
Whoa!

320
00:08:39,617 --> 00:08:40,450
Whoa!

321
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:41,283
- Oh my gosh.

322
00:08:41,283 --> 00:08:42,536
- Whoa, that's so cool.

323
00:08:42,536 --> 00:08:43,369
- Wow.

324
00:08:43,369 --> 00:08:44,202
Okay.

325
00:08:46,518 --> 00:08:47,351
- Mm!

326
00:08:48,631 --> 00:08:51,059
(unintelligible speech)

327
00:08:51,059 --> 00:08:52,334
- It's a lot of them.

328
00:08:52,334 --> 00:08:53,167
They're good.

329
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:54,000
- I have a mustache.

330
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,265
(laughing)

331
00:08:55,265 --> 00:08:56,509
- Devon has grown facial hair.

332
00:08:56,509 --> 00:08:58,149
What we have here are Fudge Flies.

333
00:08:58,149 --> 00:08:59,094
And I already opened them up and they look like

334
00:08:59,094 --> 00:09:01,030
just chocolate that they told us were flies.

335
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:03,615
But I think we'll give it a shot.

336
00:09:03,615 --> 00:09:04,924
- Any day for chocolate.

337
00:09:04,924 --> 00:09:05,992
I'll take it.

338
00:09:05,992 --> 00:09:07,513
- Let's see.

339
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:09,121
It's just chocolate in the shape of flies.

340
00:09:09,121 --> 00:09:10,868
There's nothing else to say about this one.

341
00:09:10,868 --> 00:09:13,918
And last but not least, the Voldemort Skull.

342
00:09:13,918 --> 00:09:15,928
Now this isn't I don't think necessarily Voldemort.

343
00:09:15,928 --> 00:09:17,086
There's a little bit too much color.

344
00:09:17,086 --> 00:09:18,462
- Yeah, would Voldemort wear that?

345
00:09:18,462 --> 00:09:19,295
I don't think so.

346
00:09:19,295 --> 00:09:20,351
- Yeah Voldemort would not wear this.

347
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,184
We're gonna eat these in just a moment

348
00:09:21,184 --> 00:09:22,440
but first, if you guys want us to do another

349
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,671

New videos every Thursday and every Sunday.

357
00:09:33,913 --> 00:09:36,600
Right now, let's eat Voldemort's head.

358
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,630
This is how you win over the dark side.

359
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:38,698
(laughing)

360
00:09:38,698 --> 00:09:39,531
Oh my god.

361
00:09:39,531 --> 00:09:41,424
(grunting)

362
00:09:41,424 --> 00:09:43,829
I'm about to kiss Voldemort's face right now.

363
00:09:43,829 --> 00:09:44,790
(laughing)

364
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,764
- If that's what you call a kiss.

365
00:09:46,764 --> 00:09:47,994
(laughing)

366
00:09:47,994 --> 00:09:48,827
- Alright guys, we need to teleport

367
00:09:48,827 --> 00:09:50,966
back to Hogwarts right now, eat some more candy.

368
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:52,024
In the meantime, I love you guys.

369
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:54,514
My mouth is so full with candy, it's delicious.

370
00:09:54,514 --> 00:09:56,191
See you again soon, bye!
