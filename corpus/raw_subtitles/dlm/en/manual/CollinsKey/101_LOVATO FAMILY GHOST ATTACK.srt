1
00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:03,667
(typewriter keys clacking)

2
00:00:05,705 --> 00:00:07,761
(bell chimes softly)

3
00:00:07,761 --> 00:00:11,065
(typewriter keys clacking)

4
00:00:11,065 --> 00:00:12,099
(bell chimes softly)

5
00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:12,932
- What's up guys?

6
00:00:12,932 --> 00:00:13,954
It's Collins Key.

7
00:00:13,954 --> 00:00:16,004
What, you all laughing at me already?

8
00:00:16,004 --> 00:00:17,004
Them hoodlums.

9
00:00:17,004 --> 00:00:18,666
- Not at you, we're laughing with you.

10
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:20,211
- (laughs sarcastically) Really, though.

11
00:00:20,211 --> 00:00:21,740
So I'm on my super trippy penny board,

12
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,144
and I just got here to the frickin' Queen Mary,

13
00:00:24,144 --> 00:00:26,038
which I just found out this place is haunted,

14
00:00:26,038 --> 00:00:29,406
and she, frickin' Maddie over here, troll maker.

15
00:00:29,406 --> 00:00:31,345
- Sorry, I knew you weren't gonna come,

16
00:00:31,345 --> 00:00:32,661
so I didn't tell you. - She didn't even tell me

17
00:00:32,661 --> 00:00:33,494
this place is haunted.

18
00:00:33,494 --> 00:00:36,242
She was like, "Yeah, it's like this cool ship hotel."

19
00:00:36,242 --> 00:00:40,152
I was expecting like Suite Life On Deck 2.0 on this thing.

20
00:00:40,152 --> 00:00:40,985
(girls talking over each other)

21
00:00:40,985 --> 00:00:43,678
And apparently people die in the boiler room.

22
00:00:43,678 --> 00:00:44,671
Yo, and I've already been dropped off.

23
00:00:44,671 --> 00:00:48,049
My dad, he's long gone so I can't get back to him now.

24
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:49,810
This is terrible.

25
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:50,928
Please tell everyone at home.

26
00:00:50,928 --> 00:00:52,291
Why would you do this to a brotha?

27
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:53,574
- Okay, okay.

28
00:00:53,574 --> 00:00:54,407
- A brotha.

29
00:00:54,407 --> 00:00:55,505
- I knew you weren't gonna come.

30
00:00:55,505 --> 00:00:56,338
- Uh huh.

31
00:00:56,338 --> 00:00:57,498
- Because you hate scary things.

32
00:00:57,498 --> 00:00:58,413
- Uh huh.

33
00:00:58,413 --> 00:01:01,242
- So I just didn't tell you.

34
00:01:01,242 --> 00:01:04,655
I didn't lie, I just didn't mention the fact that

35
00:01:04,655 --> 00:01:06,306
people have died. - People been dying in there.

36
00:01:06,306 --> 00:01:08,804
I'm actually really uncomfortable with this whole thing.

37
00:01:08,804 --> 00:01:10,153
WorldstarHipHop.

38
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:12,073
They're on this ledge thing and they're not supposed to be.

39
00:01:12,073 --> 00:01:13,078
There's no one coming.

40
00:01:13,078 --> 00:01:14,436
- [Maddie] Collins, scary.

41
00:01:14,436 --> 00:01:16,171
- What? - Your penny board.

42
00:01:16,171 --> 00:01:17,242
- Girl, if you die. - Give me your penny board.

43
00:01:17,242 --> 00:01:18,967
- No, I'm sorry. - No, no, no.

44
00:01:18,967 --> 00:01:20,301
- This is an intervention.

45
00:01:20,301 --> 00:01:21,134
Girl, if you fall off that edge--

46
00:01:21,134 --> 00:01:21,967
- I'm not gonna fall.

47
00:01:21,967 --> 00:01:23,306
It's extremely wide--

48
00:01:23,306 --> 00:01:24,719
- People die here!

49
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:26,187
- That's, very good point.

50
00:01:26,187 --> 00:01:27,677
People do die here, so I'm not gonna

51
00:01:27,677 --> 00:01:28,510
give you my penny board. - We're not on the boat yet,

52
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:29,463
so technically--

53
00:01:29,463 --> 00:01:31,555
- [Collins] Girl, it don't matta.

54
00:01:31,555 --> 00:01:32,785
You finna die.

55
00:01:32,785 --> 00:01:33,765
- Give me the penny board, please.

56
00:01:33,765 --> 00:01:34,598
- [Collins] No.

57
00:01:34,598 --> 00:01:35,431
- Please.

58
00:01:35,431 --> 00:01:36,417
- [Collins] That penny board will not be going to you.

59
00:01:36,417 --> 00:01:37,924
- Someone's gonna come, you need to give it to--

60
00:01:37,924 --> 00:01:38,757
- It don't matta.

61
00:01:38,757 --> 00:01:39,971
Dude, okay, do you think it's gonna be any better

62
00:01:39,971 --> 00:01:42,356
if you're scooting on a penny board across this.

63
00:01:42,356 --> 00:01:44,653
(mumbles) says someone coming.

64
00:01:44,653 --> 00:01:45,486
Oh my God.

65
00:01:46,676 --> 00:01:47,509
Yeah.

66
00:01:48,945 --> 00:01:49,778
- Ninja status.

67
00:01:49,778 --> 00:01:50,824
- So that happened.

68
00:01:50,824 --> 00:01:53,865
- What do you not understand about people die on this boat?

69
00:01:53,865 --> 00:01:55,094
You're gonna be like this,

70
00:01:55,094 --> 00:01:56,671
I'm scootin', I'm scootin',

71
00:01:56,671 --> 00:01:58,898
I'm scootin', something goes down pootin',

72
00:01:58,898 --> 00:02:00,977
I'm over to the side, and I'm like trippin',

73
00:02:00,977 --> 00:02:03,644
and then it's like off the edge.

74
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,515
Off the edge.

75
00:02:05,515 --> 00:02:06,348
What happened?

76
00:02:06,348 --> 00:02:07,667
- I went-- - Yo Madison, straight up.

77
00:02:07,667 --> 00:02:09,410
- If I could just go-- - You hit some oil.

78
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:10,243
- No, no.

79
00:02:10,243 --> 00:02:11,115
I could just go straight--

80
00:02:11,115 --> 00:02:12,367
- [Collins] This is a ship, they spout oil.

81
00:02:12,367 --> 00:02:13,915
- And I would come back and I would be fine.

82
00:02:13,915 --> 00:02:15,489
- A boiler spirit comes pushing you.

83
00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:16,322
- I would be fine.

84
00:02:16,322 --> 00:02:19,152
I am a perfect combination of stupid and brave.

85
00:02:19,152 --> 00:02:20,246
- But you also told me you're clumsy,

86
00:02:20,246 --> 00:02:22,168
which does not help your case at all.

87
00:02:22,168 --> 00:02:25,237
Why would I give you a means of death?

88
00:02:25,237 --> 00:02:26,816
That's what my penny board represents right there.

89
00:02:26,816 --> 00:02:28,428
It actually kind of looks like a ghost too,

90
00:02:28,428 --> 00:02:29,325
which is kind of weird.

91
00:02:29,325 --> 00:02:32,810
Somehow, she convinced me to frickin' come inside

92
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:34,799
of this scary place. - Because you love me.

93
00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:36,144
- [Collins] We ran into him.

94
00:02:36,144 --> 00:02:36,977
He's cool. - I am worth

95
00:02:36,977 --> 00:02:37,810
the possibility of ghosts. - Which floor I am on,

96
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:38,643
by the way?

97
00:02:38,643 --> 00:02:39,476
- [Maddie] You're on my floor.

98
00:02:39,476 --> 00:02:40,309
- I am?

99
00:02:40,309 --> 00:02:41,149
- [Girl In Leopard Print] That's not the cool floor.

100
00:02:41,149 --> 00:02:42,077
- (scoffs) Bro time.

101
00:02:42,077 --> 00:02:42,977
I just got to my room.

102
00:02:42,977 --> 00:02:44,355
My hat looks super swaggy right now.

103
00:02:44,355 --> 00:02:45,385
My room's pretty dope.

104
00:02:45,385 --> 00:02:46,577
Ow.

105
00:02:46,577 --> 00:02:47,984
I keep hitting my head on the ceiling.

106
00:02:47,984 --> 00:02:49,363
Ooh, what does this button do?

107
00:02:49,363 --> 00:02:50,196
Oops.

108
00:02:50,196 --> 00:02:51,355
(girls laughing)

109
00:02:51,355 --> 00:02:52,858
Well, glad we figured that out now.

110
00:02:52,858 --> 00:02:54,512
Did it take off my hat?

111
00:02:54,512 --> 00:02:55,496
Okay.

112
00:02:55,496 --> 00:02:56,726
These goats are tripping with me.

113
00:02:56,726 --> 00:02:58,750
I mean these goat, ghosts.

114
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,820
Ghosts.

115
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:00,770
- [Maddie] It's three in the morning.

116
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:01,905
- If you can't tell, it's three in the, yeah,

117
00:03:01,905 --> 00:03:03,693
it's three in the morning. - Nothing's making sense.

118
00:03:03,693 --> 00:03:05,616
- It wasn't that bad, I don't even--

119
00:03:05,616 --> 00:03:07,496
- Were you stuck in your backpack?

120
00:03:07,496 --> 00:03:09,069
- (scoffs) Maybe.

121
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:09,902
(girls laughing)

122
00:03:09,902 --> 00:03:10,928
Is that even a problem?

123
00:03:10,928 --> 00:03:12,801
Hey guys, like this video if you've ever been stuck

124
00:03:12,801 --> 00:03:15,631
in your backpack, yes, #ThirstyForLikes.

125
00:03:15,631 --> 00:03:17,883
So there's this beautiful view of death.

126
00:03:17,883 --> 00:03:19,345
(girls laughing)

127
00:03:19,345 --> 00:03:20,356
There's probably been someone who lived in this room

128
00:03:20,356 --> 00:03:21,259
and like, died.

129
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:22,678
- Why are you so obsessed with people dying?

130
00:03:22,678 --> 00:03:23,581
- You're obsessed with your death, Collin.

131
00:03:23,581 --> 00:03:25,184
- Because that's what this boat's all about.

132
00:03:25,184 --> 00:03:26,122
That's its MO.

133
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:27,058
Look at this.

134
00:03:27,058 --> 00:03:28,548
(electronic music)

135
00:03:28,548 --> 00:03:31,071
This boat was obviously made before people were tall.

136
00:03:31,071 --> 00:03:33,992
Fun fact, did you know that if you're over six foot, two,

137
00:03:33,992 --> 00:03:36,857
you're taller than 94% of the population?

138
00:03:36,857 --> 00:03:38,343
- So you? - That's me.

139
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,987
Watch out, I'm gonna be runnin'.

140
00:03:39,987 --> 00:03:41,406
If you're runnin', get out of my way.

141
00:03:41,406 --> 00:03:42,239
Shoot.

142
00:03:43,408 --> 00:03:44,824
- Collin! - Why would you trip me?

143
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:46,031
I felt a leg.

144
00:03:46,031 --> 00:03:47,204
- [Girls] No one tripped you.

145
00:03:47,204 --> 00:03:48,621
- Ain't my leg. - Are you kidding me?

146
00:03:48,621 --> 00:03:50,305
I kid you not, there was a leg.

147
00:03:50,305 --> 00:03:51,971
- There was no leg. - There was no leg.

148
00:03:51,971 --> 00:03:53,572
- Was this a motherfreakin' ghost?

149
00:03:53,572 --> 00:03:54,405
- [Maddie] Now it gets Collins,

150
00:03:54,405 --> 00:03:56,453
out of all the people that it could get.

151
00:03:56,453 --> 00:03:57,888
- I made up something cool right now.

152
00:03:57,888 --> 00:03:59,625
Watch this.

153
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:00,902
- [Maddie] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

154
00:04:00,902 --> 00:04:01,735
- That has to be the coolest thing

155
00:04:01,735 --> 00:04:04,096
I've ever done in my entire life.

156
00:04:04,096 --> 00:04:05,958
I'm like a giant burrito right now.

157
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:07,671
- [Maddie] Like you're wearing a toga.

158
00:04:07,671 --> 00:04:09,098
- I'm like a Chipotle burrito.

159
00:04:09,098 --> 00:04:11,552
Burrito is going to bed.

160
00:04:11,552 --> 00:04:12,453
Farewell.

161
00:04:12,453 --> 00:04:14,185
- No, no, no. - No, no, no, you have a bed.

162
00:04:14,185 --> 00:04:15,018
- [Girl In Leopard Print] Collins.

163
00:04:15,018 --> 00:04:15,851
- [Maddie] Look at him, he's--

164
00:04:15,851 --> 00:04:16,810
- [Girl In Leopard Print] He did compact himself

165
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:18,475
into that small group of space.

166
00:04:18,475 --> 00:04:22,707
- [Collins] Now I'm like a frickin' ratchet casedilla.

167
00:04:22,707 --> 00:04:23,540
- [Maddie] Collin.

168
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,373
(Maddie squeals)

169
00:04:24,373 --> 00:04:25,936
(girls laughing)

170
00:04:25,936 --> 00:04:26,769
- Chick, please.

171
00:04:26,769 --> 00:04:28,335
I'm like a Chipotle superhero.

172
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:30,001
(laughs) So sexy.

173
00:04:30,001 --> 00:04:31,148
Ow, my face.

174
00:04:31,148 --> 00:04:32,355
What's under my bed?

175
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,283
Nothing under my bed.

176
00:04:33,283 --> 00:04:35,265
He's so acrobatic. - [Maddie] Collins!

177
00:04:35,265 --> 00:04:36,619
- I'm good, I'm good.

178
00:04:36,619 --> 00:04:40,083
I think I have like polar bear disorder.

179
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:41,703
- [Maddie] Bipolar? - Yeah.

180
00:04:41,703 --> 00:04:42,990
- [Maddie] Oh my God.

181
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,139
- Did I mess that up?

182
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:44,972
- [Girl In Leopard Print] Yeah.

183
00:04:44,972 --> 00:04:47,251
It's the best thing that you've ever said.

184
00:04:47,251 --> 00:04:48,777
- [Maddie] I think I have polar bear disorder.

185
00:04:48,777 --> 00:04:51,386
- [Girl In Leopard Print] I have polar bear disorder.

186
00:04:51,386 --> 00:04:53,138
- I don't like this bed anymore.

187
00:04:53,138 --> 00:04:55,154
- [Maddie] Collins, there's another bed.

188
00:04:55,154 --> 00:04:56,224
- That one's quite sexier.

189
00:04:56,224 --> 00:04:58,465
This is my side bed.

190
00:04:58,465 --> 00:04:59,465
My main bed.

191
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:03,565
I'ma chill with my side bed for a minute.

192
00:05:03,565 --> 00:05:05,673
- [Girl In Leopard Print] Is this a metaphor for your life?

193
00:05:05,673 --> 00:05:06,786
- [Maddie] Side chicks, main chicks?

194
00:05:06,786 --> 00:05:08,340
- (laughs) I ain't got any chicks.

195
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,647
- Come on. - Who wants me to be a ninja?

196
00:05:09,647 --> 00:05:12,327
- [Maddie] No, this is gonna end so bad.

197
00:05:12,327 --> 00:05:14,244
- Pants, can't do that.

198
00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:16,924
♫ Three, two, one, go

199
00:05:16,924 --> 00:05:19,841
(electronic music)

200
00:05:29,765 --> 00:05:31,762
- All right, so I found this piano

201
00:05:31,762 --> 00:05:34,679
and I'ma try and play it right now.

202
00:05:36,388 --> 00:05:38,888
(piano music)

203
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:42,016
- [Woman] Sir, you can't play the piano.

204
00:05:42,016 --> 00:05:42,978
- [Collins] Oh, I can't play it? Okay.
