1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:01,103
- Slime dump!

2
00:00:01,103 --> 00:00:03,603
- Three, two, one! - Oh no, oh gosh.

3
00:00:03,603 --> 00:00:05,955
You challenged us to make slime with blenders!

4
00:00:05,955 --> 00:00:08,554
(dramatic music)

5
00:00:08,554 --> 00:00:10,671
Alright, let's spin for the first blender ingredient.

6
00:00:10,671 --> 00:00:11,773
Three, two, one!

7
00:00:11,773 --> 00:00:14,273
That is a solid spin. - Solid spin, nicely done.

8
00:00:14,273 --> 00:00:15,106
Good job.

9
00:00:15,106 --> 00:00:15,939
- Alright, I got white glue.

10
00:00:15,939 --> 00:00:17,279
- And I got packing peanuts.

11
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:18,669
Wait, dude, you're starting without me?

12
00:00:18,669 --> 00:00:19,722
How do I get mine?

13
00:00:19,722 --> 00:00:20,555
- Oh, well don't worry, Devan,

14
00:00:20,555 --> 00:00:21,657
because I've actually ordered something

15
00:00:21,657 --> 00:00:24,123
that should be delivered right about now. (doorbell rings)

16
00:00:24,123 --> 00:00:25,376
- [Offscreen] Yeet!

17
00:00:25,376 --> 00:00:26,209
- Geez, what? - Yes, dude!

18
00:00:26,209 --> 00:00:27,167
It's the Key delivery service,

19
00:00:27,167 --> 00:00:28,042
number four in America!

20
00:00:28,042 --> 00:00:29,323
- Wait, that's my package dude!

21
00:00:29,323 --> 00:00:30,722
Why are you shaking my package?

22
00:00:30,722 --> 00:00:32,055
- This is my shake, bro, this is my shake.

23
00:00:32,055 --> 00:00:33,271
- This is your what? - This is my shake!

24
00:00:33,271 --> 00:00:34,289
Yeet!

25
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:35,123
Alright, there we go.

26
00:00:35,123 --> 00:00:37,008
- Dude, what do you keep on talking about shakes for?

27
00:00:37,008 --> 00:00:38,004
- These are my shakes, bro.

28
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:38,837
I ordered them.

29
00:00:38,837 --> 00:00:40,558
- I thought these were my packing peanuts, Collins.

30
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:42,020
- Ah, there we go.

31
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,318
That's my shake. - What? No.

32
00:00:43,318 --> 00:00:44,547
- I'm going to enjoy that. - You only ordered one?

33
00:00:44,547 --> 00:00:45,575
How dare you.

34
00:00:45,575 --> 00:00:46,716
- Don't worry, Devan, I got you bro.

35
00:00:46,716 --> 00:00:48,165
- Oh thanks man, I appreciate it.

36
00:00:48,165 --> 00:00:48,998
- Let's see if I ordered one.

37
00:00:48,998 --> 00:00:49,881
Oh yes, I did, okay.

38
00:00:49,881 --> 00:00:50,919
Here you go.

39
00:00:50,919 --> 00:00:51,752
Cheers.

40
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:52,585
- Cheers, yes.

41
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:54,949
- And I guess I gotta return this now, so A FLEET!

42
00:00:54,949 --> 00:00:56,677
- I still don't have my packing peanuts though, bro.

43
00:00:56,677 --> 00:00:57,544
- Oh what, you mean these?

44
00:00:57,544 --> 00:00:58,377
(both shout)

45
00:00:58,377 --> 00:01:00,740
- [Devan] No, no, no!

46
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:01,573
- Well, you know what?

47
00:01:01,573 --> 00:01:02,406
I got a couple in mine.

48
00:01:02,406 --> 00:01:03,239
That's not good, so yeet!

49
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:04,227
Alright, glue is,

50
00:01:04,227 --> 00:01:05,691
ooh, that's a lot, that's a lot, that's a lot.

51
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:07,294
Time to spin the wheel for our second ingredient.

52
00:01:07,294 --> 00:01:08,127
Here we go.

53
00:01:08,127 --> 00:01:08,960
Three, two, one.

54
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,793
This better be a good ingredient

55
00:01:09,793 --> 00:01:11,692
that we can actually blend in the blender.

56
00:01:11,692 --> 00:01:13,393
Ooh I got red, okay. - I got green.

57
00:01:13,393 --> 00:01:14,226
Pink glue.

58
00:01:14,226 --> 00:01:15,073
- I got shaving cream.

59
00:01:15,073 --> 00:01:15,995
Alright, I got the shaving cream.

60
00:01:15,995 --> 00:01:18,005
And right now, there's a special way you gotta dispense it.

61
00:01:18,005 --> 00:01:19,005
- Wow, alright.

62
00:01:19,005 --> 00:01:21,257
(Collins screams)

63
00:01:21,257 --> 00:01:23,546
(both scream)

64
00:01:23,546 --> 00:01:24,473
- No, dude, my hand!

65
00:01:24,473 --> 00:01:25,432
- Touch my horn, it'll go away!

66
00:01:25,432 --> 00:01:26,332
- Okay, alright.

67
00:01:26,332 --> 00:01:28,156
- Oh no, dude, I can feel it building up again.

68
00:01:28,156 --> 00:01:29,187
I gotta add this quickly.

69
00:01:29,187 --> 00:01:30,238
Oh no, dude, it's gonna go!

70
00:01:30,238 --> 00:01:31,118
It's gonna go any second.

71
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:31,951
It's gonna go!

72
00:01:31,951 --> 00:01:33,131
Oh no, oh no, oh no.

73
00:01:33,131 --> 00:01:35,298
(screams)

74
00:01:38,555 --> 00:01:39,686
(plays flute)

75
00:01:39,686 --> 00:01:40,955
- Wait, dude, how are you floating?

76
00:01:40,955 --> 00:01:41,886
- Isn't it obvious?

77
00:01:41,886 --> 00:01:44,304
I have become one with the uni-verse.

78
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:46,622
It is now time to spin for our next ingredients.

79
00:01:46,622 --> 00:01:49,816
Uni-verse, take me to the left.

80
00:01:49,816 --> 00:01:52,565
That was great, but just a little bit to the right.

81
00:01:52,565 --> 00:01:53,398
You're doing great.

82
00:01:53,398 --> 00:01:56,748
If I could go up and to the side, just a smidge.

83
00:01:56,748 --> 00:01:57,581
Oh nice try.

84
00:01:57,581 --> 00:01:58,565
Oh I got it.

85
00:01:58,565 --> 00:02:01,298
Uni-verse, take me to the wheel.

86
00:02:01,298 --> 00:02:02,581
No, you, my wheel!

87
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:04,579
How is this so hard?!

88
00:02:04,579 --> 00:02:05,412
Alright well, right now,

89
00:02:05,412 --> 00:02:06,912
let's get back to making some slime.

90
00:02:06,912 --> 00:02:08,275
Oh my gosh, well we're about to spin

91
00:02:08,275 --> 00:02:09,715
for our final ingredient.

92
00:02:09,715 --> 00:02:10,745
And you actually have the chance

93
00:02:10,745 --> 00:02:11,994
to win some crazy prize,

94
00:02:11,994 --> 00:02:13,877
because this video is sponsored by Honey Nut Cheerios.

95
00:02:13,877 --> 00:02:15,610
So stick around to find out how you can win,

96
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:16,809
and right now, let's spin.

97
00:02:16,809 --> 00:02:18,878
Three, two, one.

98
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:20,236
Alright, let's see what this is.

99
00:02:20,236 --> 00:02:21,328
- [Devan] Mine is activator.

100
00:02:21,328 --> 00:02:22,166
- [Collins] Green paint.

101
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:23,044
Tell me with the green paint,

102
00:02:23,044 --> 00:02:24,540
I got my friend Tony the Tiger right here.

103
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,476
We're going to feed him a little bit

104
00:02:25,476 --> 00:02:26,309
of this green paint.

105
00:02:26,309 --> 00:02:27,639
Om nom nom nom nom!

106
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:29,089
He's still super, super, super hungry.

107
00:02:29,089 --> 00:02:30,241
That's why his mouth is still open.

108
00:02:30,241 --> 00:02:31,074
- Oh no, dude!

109
00:02:31,074 --> 00:02:33,003
It looks like Tony the Tiger has a terrible tummyache.

110
00:02:33,003 --> 00:02:34,056
Oh no, oh no, oh no!

111
00:02:34,056 --> 00:02:35,436
- Oh what's going to happen, dude?

112
00:02:35,436 --> 00:02:38,117
- Three, two, one (retching)

113
00:02:38,117 --> 00:02:38,950
Oh my gosh, Tony.

114
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:39,783
You feeling better?

115
00:02:39,783 --> 00:02:40,667
(tiger roaring)

116
00:02:40,667 --> 00:02:41,833
Time to spin for the final ingredient,

117
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:43,071
then we get to blend this all up

118
00:02:43,071 --> 00:02:45,213
and see, can you really make slime in a blender?

119
00:02:45,213 --> 00:02:46,046
So here we go.

120
00:02:46,046 --> 00:02:47,546
Three, two, one.

121
00:02:47,546 --> 00:02:49,342
I hope I get a final good ingredient.

122
00:02:49,342 --> 00:02:50,731
- I'm thinking red.

123
00:02:50,731 --> 00:02:51,564
- Red?

124
00:02:51,564 --> 00:02:52,397
I got green, okay.

125
00:02:52,397 --> 00:02:53,230
Yes!

126
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,063
Dude, I got an activator!

127
00:02:54,063 --> 00:02:54,896
- Oh, nice.

128
00:02:54,896 --> 00:02:56,097
And I got metallic pigment.

129
00:02:56,097 --> 00:02:57,747
This stuff is really cool, Collins.

130
00:02:57,747 --> 00:02:58,879
- This thing is, like, stuck.

131
00:02:58,879 --> 00:02:59,712
How does this thing work?

132
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,575
(object breaking)

133
00:03:00,575 --> 00:03:02,352
Well, you know, I guess we have to add some Sta-Flo now.

134
00:03:02,352 --> 00:03:03,675
So you know how much I need to add, Devan?

135
00:03:03,675 --> 00:03:04,629
One this dude!

136
00:03:04,629 --> 00:03:07,046
(rock music)

137
00:03:08,384 --> 00:03:09,470
And that's enough of this dude.

138
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,884
Alright, here we go, the moment of truth!

139
00:03:10,884 --> 00:03:12,487
Can we blend this into slime?

140
00:03:12,487 --> 00:03:13,320
You ready?

141
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,383
Three, two, wait!

142
00:03:14,383 --> 00:03:15,533
First, three second like challenge.

143
00:03:15,533 --> 00:03:16,985
We want to see if you can like this video

144
00:03:16,985 --> 00:03:18,334
in three seconds.

145
00:03:18,334 --> 00:03:19,167
Are you ready?

146
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:21,000
Three, two, one, done!

147
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:24,143
Whoa dude, look at this!

148
00:03:24,143 --> 00:03:24,976
It's all green!

149
00:03:24,976 --> 00:03:26,290
It's working! - It totally works!

150
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,123
- And stop.

151
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:28,604
Alright, let's just see how this is turning out, bro.

152
00:03:28,604 --> 00:03:29,437
Is it working?

153
00:03:29,437 --> 00:03:30,355
- Whoa, whoa.

154
00:03:30,355 --> 00:03:31,739
- Yours looks so crazy.

155
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:33,538
Dude, this thing got blended up like crazy.

156
00:03:33,538 --> 00:03:34,464
Now let's add it to the bowl

157
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:35,604
for the final part here.

158
00:03:35,604 --> 00:03:37,603
Let's see if the bottom is any different from the top.

159
00:03:37,603 --> 00:03:38,436
What?

160
00:03:38,436 --> 00:03:39,269
- Whoa.

161
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:40,102
- It came right out!

162
00:03:40,102 --> 00:03:41,319
No way. - What?

163
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:43,424
- The slime literally broke the blender.

164
00:03:43,424 --> 00:03:46,008
I can't believe a blender, like, legit made slime.

165
00:03:46,008 --> 00:03:47,727
Dude, yours looks crazy.

166
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:48,927
- This looks so awesome.

167
00:03:48,927 --> 00:03:52,101
Dude, this slime has me looking like Metallic Man!

168
00:03:52,101 --> 00:03:53,717
(dramatic music)

169
00:03:53,717 --> 00:03:54,601
- Why'd you freeze?

170
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:55,999
- Because if I move, it'll go away.

171
00:03:55,999 --> 00:03:57,169
- No, Devan, we've gotten way better at this.

172
00:03:57,169 --> 00:03:58,410
You can move around now.

173
00:03:58,410 --> 00:03:59,732
- Whoa, whoa!

174
00:03:59,732 --> 00:04:00,565
- Exactly.

175
00:04:00,565 --> 00:04:01,398
- Ha, ha, ha!

176
00:04:01,398 --> 00:04:02,359
- You get to comment down below

177
00:04:02,359 --> 00:04:03,694
who made cooler blender slime.

178
00:04:03,694 --> 00:04:05,577
And right now, we're onto the next round!

179
00:04:05,577 --> 00:04:08,032
Right now, time to spin for our, oh my gosh!

180
00:04:08,032 --> 00:04:09,494
For the first ingredient.

181
00:04:09,494 --> 00:04:10,827
Three, two, one.

182
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:13,886
Alright, let's see what our first ingredient is.

183
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:14,838
- Dude, I got a candle.

184
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:16,273
- Dude, I got pancake batter.

185
00:04:16,273 --> 00:04:18,596
Dude, these are literally instant pancakes.

186
00:04:18,596 --> 00:04:19,826
- You know, there's a couple steps to it.

187
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:20,659
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

188
00:04:20,659 --> 00:04:21,492
I'll show you the couple steps.

189
00:04:21,492 --> 00:04:22,644
You go like this. (clanging)

190
00:04:22,644 --> 00:04:23,554
So there we go, that's number one,

191
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:24,705
and then-- - Whoa.

192
00:04:24,705 --> 00:04:26,485
Wow! (chicken squacking)

193
00:04:26,485 --> 00:04:27,318
- Dude, what are you doing?

194
00:04:27,318 --> 00:04:28,151
You broke-- - Oh snap!

195
00:04:28,151 --> 00:04:28,984
See, it's becoming instant.

196
00:04:28,984 --> 00:04:30,572
- Whoa, dude, okay.

197
00:04:30,572 --> 00:04:32,623
(Collins screams)

198
00:04:32,623 --> 00:04:34,626
- And now for the final step for my instant pancakes.

199
00:04:34,626 --> 00:04:35,459
Here we go.

200
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:36,660
Three, two, one, bam!

201
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,372
Just like that, boom, instant pancakes.

202
00:04:38,372 --> 00:04:39,609
- Wait, how did you do that?

203
00:04:39,609 --> 00:04:40,941
- I actually got a little bit left.

204
00:04:40,941 --> 00:04:42,272
Hold on, let me just.

205
00:04:42,272 --> 00:04:43,105
- What?

206
00:04:43,105 --> 00:04:44,103
Alright, I'm going to try putting this

207
00:04:44,103 --> 00:04:45,902
in the microwave and melting it down.

208
00:04:45,902 --> 00:04:48,155
(rubber chicken squeaking)

209
00:04:48,155 --> 00:04:49,361
Alright, it's out of the microwave.

210
00:04:49,361 --> 00:04:51,001
This stuff actually looks super cool.

211
00:04:51,001 --> 00:04:53,553
- Dude, that looks like a strawberry puree.

212
00:04:53,553 --> 00:04:54,586
Alright, here we go, time for the spin.

213
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:55,706
Three, two, one.

214
00:04:55,706 --> 00:04:57,049
Alright, let's see here.

215
00:04:57,049 --> 00:04:57,882
What?

216
00:04:57,882 --> 00:04:59,152
Okay, I got something, like, very slime-related.

217
00:04:59,152 --> 00:05:00,117
I got white slime.

218
00:05:00,117 --> 00:05:01,166
- I got white glue.

219
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:02,598
Alright, so I got my, oh my gosh!

220
00:05:02,598 --> 00:05:03,431
Woo!

221
00:05:03,431 --> 00:05:04,710
- This is looking weird.

222
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,568
- Oops, oh no.

223
00:05:06,568 --> 00:05:07,605
Okay, back in, back in.

224
00:05:07,605 --> 00:05:09,378
Okay, let's try it again.

225
00:05:09,378 --> 00:05:10,211
Yes!

226
00:05:10,211 --> 00:05:11,044
A little weird.

227
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:12,992
(gasps) Could you, like, make a candle out of it?

228
00:05:12,992 --> 00:05:13,894
Like a candle slime?

229
00:05:13,894 --> 00:05:14,898
- Is that possible?

230
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:15,996
- Time to spin for the next ingredient.

231
00:05:15,996 --> 00:05:17,640
Three, two, one.

232
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,878
Okay, let's see what mine says.

233
00:05:18,878 --> 00:05:19,711
- I got shaving cream.

234
00:05:19,711 --> 00:05:20,674
- I got toast?

235
00:05:20,674 --> 00:05:21,507
What?

236
00:05:21,507 --> 00:05:23,020
Nothing is worse than untoasted bread.

237
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:26,426
This is a job for The Human Warmer!

238
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:27,259
Warm on!

239
00:05:28,776 --> 00:05:30,155
- You look like just you.

240
00:05:30,155 --> 00:05:31,490
- No, I mean, look at my hands.

241
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,056
Powers aside, give me the toast.

242
00:05:33,056 --> 00:05:33,889
Here we go.

243
00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:36,622
I'm going to have to go to a maximum.

244
00:05:36,622 --> 00:05:38,985
- Hate to say it, it looks exactly the same.

245
00:05:38,985 --> 00:05:39,934
- Feel it, just feel it.

246
00:05:39,934 --> 00:05:41,834
- I mean, yeah, slightly warmer.

247
00:05:41,834 --> 00:05:42,667
- Dude, okay, I can tell

248
00:05:42,667 --> 00:05:43,545
you don't take my powers seriously.

249
00:05:43,545 --> 00:05:44,378
You know what?

250
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:45,211
I'm done with this, bro.

251
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:46,885
Human Warmer out!

252
00:05:46,885 --> 00:05:48,415
- Why did he disappear?

253
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,611
Okay, well, I guess I'll continue making my slime.

254
00:05:50,611 --> 00:05:51,479
- Okay, and I'm back.

255
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:52,380
- Whoa, where did you come from?

256
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,231
- I came from the pantry.

257
00:05:53,231 --> 00:05:54,064
I found a toaster.

258
00:05:54,064 --> 00:05:55,720
I mean I, uh, used my powers.

259
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,960
- Did you say you found a toaster?

260
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,793
- What?

261
00:05:57,793 --> 00:05:58,626
Yes, I am the toaster.

262
00:05:58,626 --> 00:06:00,111
- So you're admitting your powers are useless.

263
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:02,099
- The toast is going in!

264
00:06:02,099 --> 00:06:03,651
My aim is not that good (laughs).

265
00:06:03,651 --> 00:06:04,599
Time to mix in the toast!

266
00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:06,351
Oh, that's crunchy.

267
00:06:06,351 --> 00:06:07,683
Holy cow, I can feel the burnt-ness.

268
00:06:07,683 --> 00:06:10,038
It's, like, engulfing my fingertips, bro.

269
00:06:10,038 --> 00:06:11,553
Whoa, alright the bowl's going, whoa!

270
00:06:11,553 --> 00:06:13,493
Oh my gosh, I got flour everywhere!

271
00:06:13,493 --> 00:06:14,326
Time for the final,

272
00:06:14,326 --> 00:06:15,402
Devon, come on bro. - What?

273
00:06:15,402 --> 00:06:16,586
- I hope this pulls it together.

274
00:06:16,586 --> 00:06:18,652
Because otherwise, mine's an absolute disaster.

275
00:06:18,652 --> 00:06:20,324
- Yes, I got an activator!

276
00:06:20,324 --> 00:06:21,919
- No, I got eggs!

277
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,242
Let's add some eggs and hopefully this works.

278
00:06:23,242 --> 00:06:24,075
You ready?

279
00:06:24,075 --> 00:06:25,413
Three, two, one.

280
00:06:25,413 --> 00:06:26,246
What?

281
00:06:26,246 --> 00:06:27,081
Wait a minute.

282
00:06:27,081 --> 00:06:28,181
- Is it hard-boiled? - Dude, it's hard-boiled!

283
00:06:28,181 --> 00:06:29,771
- Because it's like the mystery wheel challenge!

284
00:06:29,771 --> 00:06:31,244
Half of them must be hard-boiled,

285
00:06:31,244 --> 00:06:32,795
and the other half must be raw.

286
00:06:32,795 --> 00:06:33,628
Oh!

287
00:06:33,628 --> 00:06:34,461
Let's crack them on your head

288
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:35,530
and find out which is which!

289
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:36,772
- That is a horrible game!

290
00:06:36,772 --> 00:06:37,605
- Three, two, one.

291
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:38,438
- Ow!

292
00:06:39,646 --> 00:06:40,493
- Gonna try another egg.

293
00:06:40,493 --> 00:06:41,326
Three, two, one.

294
00:06:41,326 --> 00:06:42,159
- Ow, ow!

295
00:06:43,076 --> 00:06:44,943
- Oh, it's regular. - It's regular?

296
00:06:44,943 --> 00:06:46,247
I mean, how do you like it, bro?

297
00:06:46,247 --> 00:06:47,494
- Oh no!

298
00:06:47,494 --> 00:06:49,052
Yes! - It was hard-boiled!

299
00:06:49,052 --> 00:06:50,753
- Three, two, one!

300
00:06:50,753 --> 00:06:51,586
- Oh!

301
00:06:53,606 --> 00:06:55,158
Ow!

302
00:06:55,158 --> 00:06:56,271
I think I'm done with this game.

303
00:06:56,271 --> 00:06:57,456
My head feels like it just got hit

304
00:06:57,456 --> 00:06:59,154
with a hundred hammers.

305
00:06:59,154 --> 00:06:59,987
Alright, here we go.

306
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:01,006
Let's go for the final mix.

307
00:07:01,006 --> 00:07:02,406
Oh, that feels weird.

308
00:07:02,406 --> 00:07:05,890
- I'm going to try putting it back into a candle.

309
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:07,078
- Let's see if it actually lights.

310
00:07:07,078 --> 00:07:08,276
- Oh, that'd be so cool.

311
00:07:08,276 --> 00:07:09,159
Alright, time to light it.

312
00:07:09,159 --> 00:07:09,992
Here we go.

313
00:07:09,992 --> 00:07:10,825
- Dude, it isn't gonna work.

314
00:07:10,825 --> 00:07:12,173
- Three, two, one.

315
00:07:12,173 --> 00:07:13,006
Oh!

316
00:07:13,006 --> 00:07:14,212
- What? No way.

317
00:07:14,212 --> 00:07:15,747
- No way.

318
00:07:15,747 --> 00:07:17,540
- Dude, you literally made, like, candle slime!

319
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,373
So you get to comment down below

320
00:07:18,373 --> 00:07:19,206
who made a cooler slime.

321
00:07:19,206 --> 00:07:20,689
Is it my awesome breakfast slime?

322
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:22,384
- Or is it my candle slime?

323
00:07:22,384 --> 00:07:25,005
- Yep, right now, we are on to the next round.

324
00:07:25,005 --> 00:07:26,208
Time to spin for the first ingredient.

325
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:27,041
Here we go.

326
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:28,396
Three, two, one.

327
00:07:28,396 --> 00:07:29,400
This is kind of unusual.

328
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,874
I'm already getting, like, a made slime.

329
00:07:30,874 --> 00:07:32,540
I'm getting blue slime. - Really?

330
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,373
That's weird.

331
00:07:33,373 --> 00:07:34,206
Well mine is clear glue.

332
00:07:34,206 --> 00:07:35,039
- Blue slime?

333
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,052
Bro, this is more like a turquoise.

334
00:07:36,052 --> 00:07:37,306
It looks closely to Gumby than it does

335
00:07:37,306 --> 00:07:38,231
to an actual blue.

336
00:07:38,231 --> 00:07:39,933
Dude, let's see how far we can stretch him!

337
00:07:39,933 --> 00:07:40,978
- I'm so down, I'm so down.

338
00:07:40,978 --> 00:07:41,811
- Go for it!

339
00:07:41,811 --> 00:07:42,644
Don't let go, you promise?

340
00:07:42,644 --> 00:07:43,477
- I promise.

341
00:07:43,477 --> 00:07:46,477
(suspenseful music)

342
00:07:48,182 --> 00:07:49,149
- Ah, dude!

343
00:07:49,149 --> 00:07:50,597
Devon! - I crossed my toes.

344
00:07:50,597 --> 00:07:51,629
- That was, what, how?

345
00:07:51,629 --> 00:07:52,694
Let's see how far I can stretch him.

346
00:07:52,694 --> 00:07:53,527
Step back.

347
00:07:53,527 --> 00:07:54,360
How is this possible?

348
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,893
Oh, he's indestructible!

349
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,970
Oh, what is this?

350
00:07:58,970 --> 00:07:59,945
- Wait, hold up.

351
00:07:59,945 --> 00:08:00,778
- I call it!

352
00:08:00,778 --> 00:08:01,611
I want it in my slime.

353
00:08:01,611 --> 00:08:03,891
There, extra bonus ingredient for this one.

354
00:08:03,891 --> 00:08:05,130
- Now it's time to add my glue.

355
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:06,370
- Alright, let's go for the next spin.

356
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:07,384
Three, two, one.

357
00:08:07,384 --> 00:08:08,217
I hope I get something

358
00:08:08,217 --> 00:08:09,932
that's going to make my slime more buoyant.

359
00:08:09,932 --> 00:08:10,765
- Red.

360
00:08:10,765 --> 00:08:11,886
- (laughs) Red.

361
00:08:11,886 --> 00:08:12,719
Ooh, what?

362
00:08:12,719 --> 00:08:13,784
- Ooh, I got an activator, bro!

363
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:15,017
- I got seaweed.

364
00:08:15,017 --> 00:08:16,382
Well I guess we have to see what kind of seaweed it is

365
00:08:16,382 --> 00:08:17,616
because that makes all the difference.

366
00:08:17,616 --> 00:08:18,449
Bro! - What?

367
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:19,478
- I got wet seaweed!

368
00:08:19,478 --> 00:08:20,651
Hopefully, I can use my little star wand

369
00:08:20,651 --> 00:08:22,484
to make it better, so.

370
00:08:27,999 --> 00:08:30,063
(screams)

371
00:08:30,063 --> 00:08:31,230
- Dude, it actually worked!

372
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,063
- Oh my gosh!

373
00:08:32,063 --> 00:08:32,930
The only thing it's missing right now

374
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:33,831
is some seasoning.

375
00:08:33,831 --> 00:08:35,683
Just go like this, and oh no!

376
00:08:35,683 --> 00:08:37,088
Bro, it's back to wet!

377
00:08:37,088 --> 00:08:37,921
A fleet! - Whoa.

378
00:08:37,921 --> 00:08:38,939
- You know, I just have to go with my hands

379
00:08:38,939 --> 00:08:40,178
and I just gotta go for it.

380
00:08:40,178 --> 00:08:43,505
(groans in disgust)

381
00:08:43,505 --> 00:08:45,078
Three, two, one.

382
00:08:45,078 --> 00:08:46,126
I really hope it's something good

383
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:47,530
and not seaweed again.

384
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:48,755
Alright, let's see what mine says.

385
00:08:48,755 --> 00:08:49,588
- What does yours say?

386
00:08:49,588 --> 00:08:50,421
- I mean, it's decent.

387
00:08:50,421 --> 00:08:51,254
Shaving cream.

388
00:08:51,254 --> 00:08:52,087
- No!

389
00:08:52,087 --> 00:08:52,920
I got glitter.

390
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,907
It's a massive canister of glitter.

391
00:08:54,907 --> 00:08:56,057
Whoa.

392
00:08:56,057 --> 00:08:56,890
- Wait, wait.

393
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:57,723
Let me see, let me see.

394
00:08:57,723 --> 00:08:58,556
(sneezes)

395
00:08:58,556 --> 00:08:59,975
- Oh my goodness, dude!

396
00:08:59,975 --> 00:09:01,587
Your face is sparkly!

397
00:09:01,587 --> 00:09:02,639
- Dude, your face too!

398
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:04,142
I can fix it with the wand, here we go.

399
00:09:04,142 --> 00:09:05,808
Three, two, one!

400
00:09:05,808 --> 00:09:06,641
You're back to normal.

401
00:09:06,641 --> 00:09:07,474
- Did it work? - Yeah.

402
00:09:07,474 --> 00:09:08,708
Alright, here we go, now it's my turn.

403
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:10,022
Three, two, one.

404
00:09:10,022 --> 00:09:11,304
- Nope, it got worse.

405
00:09:11,304 --> 00:09:12,137
- It got worse?

406
00:09:12,137 --> 00:09:12,970
- Yeah, it got way worse.

407
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:13,854
Try the gold one.

408
00:09:13,854 --> 00:09:14,836
- Ow, is it good?

409
00:09:14,836 --> 00:09:15,805
- Yep, yeah that worked.

410
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,296
That worked.

411
00:09:17,296 --> 00:09:18,129
Here we go!

412
00:09:18,129 --> 00:09:18,962
Whoa, bro, there's like totally,

413
00:09:18,962 --> 00:09:20,422
like poke your finger down into it.

414
00:09:20,422 --> 00:09:21,487
I'm sure it'd look crazy.

415
00:09:21,487 --> 00:09:22,768
- I can't get it on my finger, bro.

416
00:09:22,768 --> 00:09:24,018
- All you need is

417
00:09:24,018 --> 00:09:25,087
a glove!

418
00:09:25,087 --> 00:09:26,671
- Three, two, one!

419
00:09:26,671 --> 00:09:28,177
- Whoa!

420
00:09:28,177 --> 00:09:29,260
- Dude, what!

421
00:09:30,343 --> 00:09:31,860
Dude, what!

422
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,651
- The seaweed particles are getting, like,

423
00:09:33,651 --> 00:09:34,601
all up in it, man.

424
00:09:34,601 --> 00:09:35,434
- I need another glove.

425
00:09:35,434 --> 00:09:36,545
Do you by any chance have another glove?

426
00:09:36,545 --> 00:09:37,378
- Ask for one.

427
00:09:37,378 --> 00:09:39,171
- Can I please have another glove?

428
00:09:39,171 --> 00:09:40,004
- There it is!

429
00:09:40,004 --> 00:09:40,837
- Wow.

430
00:09:40,837 --> 00:09:41,670
It feels like sand.

431
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,000
This looks insane!

432
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,819
- We're about to spin for our final ingredient,

433
00:09:44,819 --> 00:09:46,525
and here is how you can have the chance to win

434
00:09:46,525 --> 00:09:48,670
an XBOX One X, tablets, gift cards,

435
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,038
and a whole bunch more!

436
00:09:50,038 --> 00:09:51,537
Basically, the Be Good rewards program

437
00:09:51,537 --> 00:09:52,906
is all about doing good.

438
00:09:52,906 --> 00:09:54,219
And there are three celebrity teams

439
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:56,850
led by Michael B. Jordan, Lucy Hale, and Gronk,

440
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,453
who have each partnered up with a charity.

441
00:09:58,453 --> 00:09:59,558
I'm on Team Michael B. Jordan,

442
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:01,084
whose charity is Feeding America.

443
00:10:01,084 --> 00:10:03,563
Along with my ambassador teammate Koma Sab

444
00:10:03,563 --> 00:10:04,576
who I absolutely love.

445
00:10:04,576 --> 00:10:05,743
And I chose this team because the mission

446
00:10:05,743 --> 00:10:06,924
is super important to me.

447
00:10:06,924 --> 00:10:08,143
It's actually inspired me to donate

448
00:10:08,143 --> 00:10:09,150
to our local food bank.

449
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,506
And now, here is how you can win some awesome prizes!

450
00:10:11,506 --> 00:10:12,856
We need a box of cheerios!

451
00:10:12,856 --> 00:10:13,689
Ay!

452
00:10:13,689 --> 00:10:16,712
Register at BeGoodRewards.com, select your team,

453
00:10:16,712 --> 00:10:18,392
scan your Buzzcoin and donate.

454
00:10:18,392 --> 00:10:21,389
Join my team and help us win $100,000 for charity

455
00:10:21,389 --> 00:10:23,310
by scanning and donating your Buzzcoin.

456
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:25,215
Collect Buzzcoins, do good, and right now,

457
00:10:25,215 --> 00:10:26,755
let's spin for our final ingredients.

458
00:10:26,755 --> 00:10:27,588
Here we go.

459
00:10:27,588 --> 00:10:28,841
Three, two, one.

460
00:10:28,841 --> 00:10:30,059
I hope I get something good.

461
00:10:30,059 --> 00:10:30,892
- Dude, same.

462
00:10:30,892 --> 00:10:31,725
What?

463
00:10:31,725 --> 00:10:32,558
A tennis racket?

464
00:10:32,558 --> 00:10:33,391
- I got sand.

465
00:10:33,391 --> 00:10:34,224
Yours is weirder than mine, though.

466
00:10:34,224 --> 00:10:35,097
- Dude, I don't know.

467
00:10:35,097 --> 00:10:36,037
I don't think so, dude.

468
00:10:36,037 --> 00:10:38,064
- Give it a try. - Okay.

469
00:10:38,064 --> 00:10:40,897
(uplifting music)

470
00:10:44,247 --> 00:10:46,662
- Devan, Devan, Devan!

471
00:10:46,662 --> 00:10:47,630
What are you doing?

472
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:48,463
- What, what?

473
00:10:48,463 --> 00:10:49,350
- What was that?

474
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,017
- I just saw a life I could've had.

475
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:53,042
I now know what I must do!

476
00:10:53,042 --> 00:10:55,125
(shouts)

477
00:10:57,217 --> 00:10:58,070
- Three, two, one.

478
00:10:58,070 --> 00:10:58,903
- Try it, like, quicker.

479
00:10:58,903 --> 00:10:59,736
Yeah, it's like, up.

480
00:10:59,736 --> 00:11:00,869
Okay, I'm confused.

481
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:02,068
- Whoa!

482
00:11:02,068 --> 00:11:02,901
- Alright, you know what?

483
00:11:02,901 --> 00:11:03,734
I'm gonna add my slime now.

484
00:11:03,734 --> 00:11:04,567
Here we go.

485
00:11:04,567 --> 00:11:05,400
- Yeah, that kinda works.

486
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,451
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait!

487
00:11:06,451 --> 00:11:07,284
That looks like an alien.

488
00:11:07,284 --> 00:11:08,117
- Alright, here we go.

489
00:11:08,117 --> 00:11:09,050
I'm going to mix in the sand.

490
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:10,096
It looks like a litter box.

491
00:11:10,096 --> 00:11:11,149
You get to comment down below!

492
00:11:11,149 --> 00:11:12,678
Let us know who made a cooler slime.

493
00:11:12,678 --> 00:11:15,181
Is it my kind, like sandy beach slime?

494
00:11:15,181 --> 00:11:17,103
- Or is it my glitter storm slime?

495
00:11:17,103 --> 00:11:18,580
- We are on to the next one!

496
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,942
Okay, time to spin for the first ingredient.

497
00:11:19,942 --> 00:11:20,937
Give it a little pinch.

498
00:11:20,937 --> 00:11:21,770
Here we go.

499
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:22,703
Three, two, one.

500
00:11:22,703 --> 00:11:23,536
- That was a good spin.

501
00:11:23,536 --> 00:11:24,502
- Thank you, man. - Nicely done.

502
00:11:24,502 --> 00:11:25,716
- It was a superb spin.

503
00:11:25,716 --> 00:11:26,916
- A-okay!

504
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:27,749
- Here we go, what is this?

505
00:11:27,749 --> 00:11:28,582
- Olive oil?

506
00:11:28,582 --> 00:11:29,415
Really?

507
00:11:29,415 --> 00:11:30,715
- I got pre-made white slime.

508
00:11:30,715 --> 00:11:31,915
- Dude, what is this?

509
00:11:31,915 --> 00:11:33,198
I thought I was getting olive oil.

510
00:11:33,198 --> 00:11:34,072
These are just olives.

511
00:11:34,072 --> 00:11:35,813
- Those are just pre-juiced olive oil.

512
00:11:35,813 --> 00:11:36,672
Just try to juice them, bro.

513
00:11:36,672 --> 00:11:37,505
- How?

514
00:11:37,505 --> 00:11:38,338
How do you juice olives?

515
00:11:38,338 --> 00:11:39,662
- Come on, you've never juiced an olive?

516
00:11:39,662 --> 00:11:40,495
- Can't say I have.

517
00:11:40,495 --> 00:11:41,328
- Okay, take out an olive

518
00:11:41,328 --> 00:11:42,161
and then juice it.

519
00:11:42,161 --> 00:11:43,245
- That makes no sense! - It does!

520
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:45,416
- Three, two, one.

521
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:46,575
- Whoa! - Right?

522
00:11:46,575 --> 00:11:47,492
- And done.

523
00:11:50,189 --> 00:11:51,022
- That should be enough olive oil.

524
00:11:51,022 --> 00:11:53,846
(screams)

525
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:55,999
- Alright, now it's time to add it in.

526
00:11:55,999 --> 00:11:57,846
- Time to spin for ingredient number two right now.

527
00:11:57,846 --> 00:11:58,679
So here we go, you ready?

528
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:00,312
Three, two, one.

529
00:12:00,312 --> 00:12:01,145
I hope I get a good one.

530
00:12:01,145 --> 00:12:01,978
- So do I.

531
00:12:01,978 --> 00:12:03,462
Olive oil is not a good start.

532
00:12:03,462 --> 00:12:04,641
Oh, I got food coloring.

533
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:06,024
- I got cosmetic face mask.

534
00:12:06,024 --> 00:12:09,002
- Alright, time to add the food coloring.

535
00:12:09,002 --> 00:12:10,083
- Got it!

536
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:12,275
Ooh, they're not merging at all.

537
00:12:12,275 --> 00:12:13,192
- No, no, no!

538
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:14,025
- Devan!

539
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:14,858
- I got it on me!

540
00:12:14,858 --> 00:12:15,691
- You're gonna ruin the counter

541
00:12:15,691 --> 00:12:17,423
- No! - Oh my gosh!

542
00:12:17,423 --> 00:12:18,950
- Alright, I have made the smart decision,

543
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:20,534
and I am using gloves now.

544
00:12:20,534 --> 00:12:22,017
- Alright, so next up, we gotta be very careful.

545
00:12:22,017 --> 00:12:23,807
We're going to put on a little hand helmet here.

546
00:12:23,807 --> 00:12:25,229
Nothing can go wrong, I am fully prepared.

547
00:12:25,229 --> 00:12:26,062
Here we go.

548
00:12:26,062 --> 00:12:26,895
Three, two, one.

549
00:12:26,895 --> 00:12:28,031
Oh, that went wrong.

550
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,377
Alright, here we go, let's see how this one goes.

551
00:12:29,377 --> 00:12:30,656
Get a nice little squeeze on it.

552
00:12:30,656 --> 00:12:31,763
- What is that?

553
00:12:31,763 --> 00:12:36,413
- It's a narwhal, it's like (growling).

554
00:12:36,413 --> 00:12:38,311
And now time to commence the second spin!

555
00:12:38,311 --> 00:12:39,144
(bells ding)

556
00:12:39,144 --> 00:12:39,977
It's like, it's the third spin I think.

557
00:12:39,977 --> 00:12:40,810
- Oh.

558
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:41,894
- Hey, don't touch my bell.

559
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:43,141
Time to spin for our next ingredient.

560
00:12:43,141 --> 00:12:45,098
Three, two, one.

561
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:45,962
You really need something

562
00:12:45,962 --> 00:12:47,197
that's going to be good for your slime.

563
00:12:47,197 --> 00:12:48,030
- I know!

564
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:48,863
- Alright, let's see what we got.

565
00:12:48,863 --> 00:12:49,828
- I got filler beads.

566
00:12:49,828 --> 00:12:51,040
- Well, I got straws.

567
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,520
- These beads will not help me.

568
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,353
- Well at least you have beads!

569
00:12:53,353 --> 00:12:54,578
Where are my straws at, bro?

570
00:12:54,578 --> 00:12:57,073
Oh my gosh, I know where they are.

571
00:12:57,073 --> 00:13:00,153
I have to charm them out of the Raccoon of Recluse.

572
00:13:00,153 --> 00:13:02,618
(muffled) Give me the straws.

573
00:13:02,618 --> 00:13:04,152
Give them to me!

574
00:13:04,152 --> 00:13:05,567
(drum beats) Straws!

575
00:13:05,567 --> 00:13:06,401
Oh what's up dude?

576
00:13:06,401 --> 00:13:07,731
Yo, give me the straws, fam!

577
00:13:07,731 --> 00:13:09,401
I know you have the straws in your belly, fam!

578
00:13:09,401 --> 00:13:10,234
Ooh-hoo!

579
00:13:10,234 --> 00:13:11,067
Gotta give him the boot.

580
00:13:11,067 --> 00:13:13,016
Here we go, three, two, one.

581
00:13:13,016 --> 00:13:15,279
(laughs) He's got a strong neck.

582
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:16,331
There we go, perfect!

583
00:13:16,331 --> 00:13:17,164
Look at that!

584
00:13:17,164 --> 00:13:18,176
All the straws, he was hiding them.

585
00:13:18,176 --> 00:13:20,381
There we go, add all the straws in there.

586
00:13:20,381 --> 00:13:21,828
(grunts)

587
00:13:21,828 --> 00:13:23,727
How is this gonna, like, supposed to work?

588
00:13:23,727 --> 00:13:26,559
- Dude, I have olive oil, beads, and food coloring.

589
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:28,767
- Ooh boy, this is getting kinda funky-looking.

590
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:29,809
Three, two, one.

591
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,928
You better cross your fingers you get a good one, Devan.

592
00:13:31,928 --> 00:13:32,761
- I know!

593
00:13:32,761 --> 00:13:33,611
- Double cross them!

594
00:13:33,611 --> 00:13:35,207
Triple cross, yeah!

595
00:13:35,207 --> 00:13:36,040
- Nail polish?

596
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,873
- I got rubber band.

597
00:13:36,873 --> 00:13:38,322
- Dude, I don't know what I'm gonna do with this.

598
00:13:38,322 --> 00:13:39,689
- I got the rubber bands, let's add them.

599
00:13:39,689 --> 00:13:41,174
Three, two, one.

600
00:13:41,174 --> 00:13:43,444
And all I need now is just one final ingredient.

601
00:13:43,444 --> 00:13:44,471
- A final ingredient?

602
00:13:44,471 --> 00:13:45,554
You already have a ton.

603
00:13:45,554 --> 00:13:46,771
- Bam! - A painting?

604
00:13:46,771 --> 00:13:47,604
- No, no, no.

605
00:13:47,604 --> 00:13:48,437
An apple. - Really?

606
00:13:48,437 --> 00:13:49,470
An apple? - An apple.

607
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:50,596
- The apple's in the painting, Collins.

608
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:51,716
- Exactly, so hold on to this for me.

609
00:13:51,716 --> 00:13:52,558
- It's not a real apple.

610
00:13:52,558 --> 00:13:53,391
- Okay, so here we go.

611
00:13:53,391 --> 00:13:54,224
I've gotta warm up a bit.

612
00:13:54,224 --> 00:13:56,496
Gotta use my magic hands to do this.

613
00:13:56,496 --> 00:13:57,329
Here we go.

614
00:13:57,329 --> 00:13:59,095
Three, two, this is going to be tough, one.

615
00:13:59,095 --> 00:13:59,928
Boom!

616
00:13:59,928 --> 00:14:00,761
Just like that, got my apple.

617
00:14:00,761 --> 00:14:01,594
- It's actually gone!

618
00:14:01,594 --> 00:14:02,427
- Exactly.

619
00:14:02,427 --> 00:14:03,260
You're getting fingerprints on it, bro.

620
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,093
That's a work of art.

621
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:04,926
- I never touched it!

622
00:14:04,926 --> 00:14:05,778
- So I'm just gonna make some applesauce.

623
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:07,627
- Oh, that's not how you make applesauce, Collins.

624
00:14:07,627 --> 00:14:09,327
- This is exactly how you make applesauce.

625
00:14:09,327 --> 00:14:10,469
How else would you get it into the slime?

626
00:14:10,469 --> 00:14:11,608
Oh, oh ow.

627
00:14:11,608 --> 00:14:13,008
- Dude, it would be a miracle

628
00:14:13,008 --> 00:14:15,510
if this nail polish turned this oil into slime.

629
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:17,460
Three, two, one! - Wait, wait!

630
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,526
First, five second subscribe challenge.

631
00:14:18,526 --> 00:14:20,419
We want to see if you can subscribe to this channel

632
00:14:20,419 --> 00:14:22,152
and turn on the channel's post notifications

633
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:23,952
in five seconds.

634
00:14:23,952 --> 00:14:24,785
Are you ready?

635
00:14:24,785 --> 00:14:25,618
Here we go.

636
00:14:25,618 --> 00:14:28,451
Five, four, three, two, one, done.

637
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:30,883
If you can do that,

638
00:14:30,883 --> 00:14:32,704
comment down below "Keyper Squad" right now.

639
00:14:32,704 --> 00:14:34,253
- Three, two, one!

640
00:14:34,253 --> 00:14:35,100
- Let's hope it works.

641
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,267
- Dude, whoa!

642
00:14:37,353 --> 00:14:39,021
- It's, like, turning into slime

643
00:14:39,021 --> 00:14:40,148
- No way, no way.

644
00:14:40,148 --> 00:14:42,200
Dude, I don't want to say what this looks like,

645
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,929
but I think you know what this looks like.

646
00:14:43,929 --> 00:14:46,433
- This is the weirdest ingredient slime I've ever made.

647
00:14:46,433 --> 00:14:48,601
I made a brand new slime called Trash Can Slime!

648
00:14:48,601 --> 00:14:49,633
Because this stuff looks like trash.

649
00:14:49,633 --> 00:14:50,681
Well, you get to comment down below

650
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:52,028
who made a cooler slime.

651
00:14:52,028 --> 00:14:53,832
This is really a toss-up on this one, guys.

652
00:14:53,832 --> 00:14:55,431
And right now, we're onto the next round.

653
00:14:55,431 --> 00:14:57,211
- Alright, time to spin for our first ingredient.

654
00:14:57,211 --> 00:14:59,225
Three, two, one.

655
00:14:59,225 --> 00:15:00,190
- I got clear glue.

656
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,724
- I got floral foam.

657
00:15:01,724 --> 00:15:03,353
Wait, this is floral foam?

658
00:15:03,353 --> 00:15:04,186
You know what, Devan?

659
00:15:04,186 --> 00:15:05,202
I need to channel my inner kitty.

660
00:15:05,202 --> 00:15:06,035
Here we go.

661
00:15:06,035 --> 00:15:07,170
Wha-cha!

662
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:09,479
(gibberish)

663
00:15:09,479 --> 00:15:10,478
And done!

664
00:15:10,478 --> 00:15:11,892
Whew, bro, that got dusty.

665
00:15:11,892 --> 00:15:14,343
Hairball! (retches)

666
00:15:14,343 --> 00:15:15,176
- Ugh.

667
00:15:15,176 --> 00:15:16,009
- We're to spin for the next ingredient,

668
00:15:16,009 --> 00:15:17,608
but first, I've gotta soak my foam.

669
00:15:17,608 --> 00:15:19,242
(gasps) We should do some foam crushing, bro!

670
00:15:19,242 --> 00:15:20,489
We got the big bowl right here.

671
00:15:20,489 --> 00:15:21,388
Oh, I gotta submerge my,

672
00:15:21,388 --> 00:15:22,775
three, two, one.

673
00:15:22,775 --> 00:15:25,025
(grunting)

674
00:15:26,135 --> 00:15:27,550
Alright, now it's time to spin the wheel.

675
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,420
So, right now, here we go.

676
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,253
Ready?

677
00:15:29,253 --> 00:15:30,560
Three, two, one.

678
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,462
I'm gonna predict it's gonna land on Devan.

679
00:15:32,462 --> 00:15:33,813
- What? - I'm landing on Devan!

680
00:15:33,813 --> 00:15:35,670
- I got activator, yes!

681
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:36,503
- I got glitter!

682
00:15:36,503 --> 00:15:37,980
- Alright, I have my activator here.

683
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:38,813
- You know what?

684
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:39,660
I'm not a fan of the glitter,

685
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,317
so I'm going to use this thingy instead.

686
00:15:41,317 --> 00:15:43,081
So that way I don't have to touch any glitter.

687
00:15:43,081 --> 00:15:43,914
Uh oh.

688
00:15:43,914 --> 00:15:45,080
Focus!

689
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,625
Oh no!

690
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:50,157
No, no! (screaming)

691
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:50,990
- Yes!

692
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:51,935
- I have to use these gloves,

693
00:15:51,935 --> 00:15:53,162
that way it won't get on me at all.

694
00:15:53,162 --> 00:15:53,995
Yes!

695
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:54,876
I think I'm the first ever boxer

696
00:15:54,876 --> 00:15:56,424
to use gloves for this purpose.

697
00:15:56,424 --> 00:15:57,527
- Wait, just because you have gloves

698
00:15:57,527 --> 00:15:59,108
doesn't mean you're an actual boxer.

699
00:15:59,108 --> 00:16:00,707
- Oh, let's go! (bell dings)

700
00:16:00,707 --> 00:16:01,874
- Okay, you're a real boxer.

701
00:16:01,874 --> 00:16:02,941
- [Collins] Glad we got that settled.

702
00:16:02,941 --> 00:16:04,392
I'm going to add some bigger chunks of glitter because--

703
00:16:04,392 --> 00:16:05,887
- Does that classify as glitter?

704
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:08,855
Because if so, that's the first glitter I actually like.

705
00:16:08,855 --> 00:16:09,986
- [Collins] Gonna add a little bit in there like that.

706
00:16:09,986 --> 00:16:11,804
- Can't you just open it with your hands?

707
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:12,637
- Okay, fine.

708
00:16:12,637 --> 00:16:14,694
- But I get glitter on my hands--

709
00:16:14,694 --> 00:16:15,527
- It's on you.

710
00:16:15,527 --> 00:16:16,422
- Yeah.

711
00:16:16,422 --> 00:16:17,551
Oh no, it's already on my hand.

712
00:16:17,551 --> 00:16:18,384
Alright, the glitter is in

713
00:16:18,384 --> 00:16:19,668
and now it's time for the next spin.

714
00:16:19,668 --> 00:16:21,090
Three, two, one.

715
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:23,100
I just really hope I do not get double glitter.

716
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,124
Like, that would be horrible.

717
00:16:24,124 --> 00:16:25,056
- Wait, you can do that?

718
00:16:25,056 --> 00:16:26,305
- Alright, let's see what we got.

719
00:16:26,305 --> 00:16:27,138
What?

720
00:16:27,138 --> 00:16:27,971
- [Devan] Mirror dust?

721
00:16:27,971 --> 00:16:28,835
- I got clear slime.

722
00:16:28,835 --> 00:16:29,756
Alright, we got some clear slime

723
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:30,985
and this is about to get crazy!

724
00:16:30,985 --> 00:16:32,235
- Yeah, but how do you get mirror dust?

725
00:16:32,235 --> 00:16:33,187
- You have to go to Mirrorland.

726
00:16:33,187 --> 00:16:34,020
- Mirror what?

727
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:34,853
- Mirrorland.

728
00:16:34,853 --> 00:16:35,686
- Never heard of it.

729
00:16:35,686 --> 00:16:36,519
- What?

730
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:37,683
You're going to Mirrorland right now.

731
00:16:37,683 --> 00:16:38,803
You gotta grab yourself a mirror,

732
00:16:38,803 --> 00:16:39,885
and you have to enter the mirror.

733
00:16:39,885 --> 00:16:40,718
- How?

734
00:16:40,718 --> 00:16:41,951
- Uh, cannonball.

735
00:16:41,951 --> 00:16:43,284
Three, two, one.

736
00:16:46,244 --> 00:16:47,125
- Whoa!

737
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,179
Hello?

738
00:16:48,179 --> 00:16:49,261
Is this Mirrorland?

739
00:16:49,261 --> 00:16:51,014
- Oh dude, it's Mirrorland, bro.

740
00:16:51,014 --> 00:16:51,876
Now go get the dust.

741
00:16:51,876 --> 00:16:52,709
- Dude, where?

742
00:16:52,709 --> 00:16:53,960
- Dude, it's over by the doors.

743
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,793
- Doors?

744
00:16:54,793 --> 00:16:55,626
What doors?

745
00:16:55,626 --> 00:16:56,959
Oh, those doors.

746
00:16:58,546 --> 00:16:59,588
Oh, wrong door, wrong door!

747
00:16:59,588 --> 00:17:00,908
- Oh geez, I hate that door.

748
00:17:00,908 --> 00:17:01,905
- I got the dust, Collins.

749
00:17:01,905 --> 00:17:02,806
Now get me out!

750
00:17:02,806 --> 00:17:03,971
Get me out!

751
00:17:03,971 --> 00:17:05,225
- Don't know how.

752
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:07,975
- Fine. (shouts)

753
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:10,869
(glass shatters)

754
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:12,756
I have conquered Mirrorland

755
00:17:12,756 --> 00:17:14,725
and acquired the mirror dust!

756
00:17:14,725 --> 00:17:15,558
- Okay dude, relax.

757
00:17:15,558 --> 00:17:16,487
You just got a little bit of dust.

758
00:17:16,487 --> 00:17:18,987
You get the slightly wonky helmet of wonk.

759
00:17:18,987 --> 00:17:20,372
- I don't need it anymore.

760
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:21,969
Quite a quest.

761
00:17:21,969 --> 00:17:24,053
(tearfully) Hold me, brother!

762
00:17:24,053 --> 00:17:25,812
I will make you king of the land!

763
00:17:25,812 --> 00:17:27,935
- Sweet, I'm going to wear this thing forever.

764
00:17:27,935 --> 00:17:28,935
Alright!

765
00:17:28,935 --> 00:17:30,034
- Time to add the dust.

766
00:17:30,034 --> 00:17:31,301
- What does it look like, actually?

767
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:32,517
- I wasn't able to see it.

768
00:17:32,517 --> 00:17:35,166
- How did you capture it without seeing it?

769
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:36,732
- Dude, it looks like a mirror!

770
00:17:36,732 --> 00:17:37,862
- It's a little bit dusty.

771
00:17:37,862 --> 00:17:38,815
The moment of truth.

772
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,583
Some satisfying foam crushing with a sparkle.

773
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,530
Let's see how cool this thing looks.

774
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:43,363
Oh!

775
00:17:43,363 --> 00:17:45,047
- Whoa, what!

776
00:17:45,047 --> 00:17:47,363
- That was not satisfying at all.

777
00:17:47,363 --> 00:17:48,461
- Whoa.

778
00:17:48,461 --> 00:17:49,748
- Well, you get to comment down below

779
00:17:49,748 --> 00:17:50,980
who made a cooler slime.

780
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,050
We're outside and it's time for the slime dump.

781
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:54,196
- It's time to dump it on you.

782
00:17:54,196 --> 00:17:55,029
- Nope.

783
00:17:55,029 --> 00:17:55,894
- What? - I have the bucket.

784
00:17:55,894 --> 00:17:56,727
- I know you have the bucket,

785
00:17:56,727 --> 00:17:58,378
but you can't dump it on me, dude.

786
00:17:58,378 --> 00:17:59,211
- You know what?

787
00:17:59,211 --> 00:18:00,044
I think you lost this challenge, bro.

788
00:18:00,044 --> 00:18:00,877
- What?

789
00:18:00,877 --> 00:18:01,710
- I swept this game, bro.

790
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:02,623
It was all mine.

791
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,006
- See, I thought this might happen,

792
00:18:04,006 --> 00:18:05,472
so I brought a backup plan.

793
00:18:05,472 --> 00:18:06,727
- Wait, wait, wait, what?

794
00:18:06,727 --> 00:18:07,742
Devan? Devan?

795
00:18:07,742 --> 00:18:08,687
Where are you, Devan?

796
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:09,520
Where'd you go?

797
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,353
This is not good.

798
00:18:10,353 --> 00:18:11,290
Apparently Devan's somewhere with a--

799
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,157
(screams)

800
00:18:13,157 --> 00:18:14,789
Oh my gosh!

801
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:15,652
- It actually kind of worked!

802
00:18:15,652 --> 00:18:16,526
- That is not fair!

803
00:18:16,526 --> 00:18:17,625
- You like my slime?

804
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:18,960
It's mac and cheese slime, bro.

805
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,604
- Dude, I do not want cheese on my hair at all.

806
00:18:20,604 --> 00:18:21,437
- Well, I got it.

807
00:18:21,437 --> 00:18:22,652
Then you give me that bucket,

808
00:18:22,652 --> 00:18:24,210
and I won't dump this on your head.

809
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:25,404
- Okay fine, you got my bucket of slime.

810
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:26,333
- Alright, there we go.

811
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:27,269
Can you hold this a minute?

812
00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:28,338
- (screams) Is this even slime?

813
00:18:28,338 --> 00:18:29,355
It looks like mac and cheese.

814
00:18:29,355 --> 00:18:30,687
- I know, it looks like you could eat it.

815
00:18:30,687 --> 00:18:31,656
But you can't, no.

816
00:18:31,656 --> 00:18:32,489
- Don't eat this.

817
00:18:32,489 --> 00:18:33,322
- Collins, you need to sit down.

818
00:18:33,322 --> 00:18:34,155
Grab a chair.

819
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:35,095
- (laughs) I grab no chair!

820
00:18:35,095 --> 00:18:36,523
I grab my throne.

821
00:18:36,523 --> 00:18:37,520
- I think it's just a chair.

822
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,353
- No, it's my throne.

823
00:18:38,353 --> 00:18:39,486
- Okay well, grab it dude.

824
00:18:39,486 --> 00:18:40,319
- Okay!

825
00:18:41,222 --> 00:18:42,285
Devan, come here, I need your help.

826
00:18:42,285 --> 00:18:43,118
- What?

827
00:18:43,118 --> 00:18:43,951
- Come here, come here quick!

828
00:18:43,951 --> 00:18:44,784
- Really dude?

829
00:18:44,784 --> 00:18:45,617
Seriously?

830
00:18:45,617 --> 00:18:46,450
Alright, fine.

831
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:48,950
(regal music)

832
00:18:52,501 --> 00:18:53,411
There you go.

833
00:18:53,411 --> 00:18:55,119
There's your chair.

834
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:56,135
- Oh. - No, what?

835
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,718
- It's broken.

836
00:18:57,718 --> 00:18:59,546
I guess we have to cancel the slime dump, guys.

837
00:18:59,546 --> 00:19:00,567
- No, none of that.

838
00:19:00,567 --> 00:19:02,236
Look, simply fixed.

839
00:19:02,236 --> 00:19:03,069
- How did you do that?

840
00:19:03,069 --> 00:19:04,234
Okay well, I guess we just have

841
00:19:04,234 --> 00:19:05,268
to go for the slime dump, right?

842
00:19:05,268 --> 00:19:06,402
- Yep, that's what I'd say.

843
00:19:06,402 --> 00:19:08,124
- Oh no, I'm tipping backwards.

844
00:19:08,124 --> 00:19:09,401
- No, no, no.

845
00:19:09,401 --> 00:19:10,914
- This is like a rollercoaster!

846
00:19:10,914 --> 00:19:11,950
(screams)

847
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:14,682
Ya boy doesn't want to get a slime dump.

848
00:19:14,682 --> 00:19:15,515
(cracking)

849
00:19:15,515 --> 00:19:16,598
- Oh. - I heard it.

850
00:19:16,598 --> 00:19:17,546
- I nailed my toe!

851
00:19:17,546 --> 00:19:18,726
- That's because you don't have shoes on.

852
00:19:18,726 --> 00:19:19,559
Oh.

853
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:20,392
I should not have shoes on.

854
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:21,415
That means I've gotta give this a new kind of yeet.

855
00:19:21,415 --> 00:19:23,714
We call this one, keet!

856
00:19:23,714 --> 00:19:24,561
It's kick yeet!

857
00:19:24,561 --> 00:19:26,061
Three, two, one, keet!

858
00:19:26,061 --> 00:19:26,965
- Alright, here we go.

859
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:29,364
Three, two, you know what, dude?

860
00:19:29,364 --> 00:19:30,653
I think we've done this before.

861
00:19:30,653 --> 00:19:33,359
This doesn't feel like the stakes are high enough, bro.

862
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:35,061
I think we need to up the ante.

863
00:19:35,061 --> 00:19:37,440
Oh, I have the perfect idea!

864
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,273
- What?

865
00:19:38,273 --> 00:19:39,617
No, Devan, come back!

866
00:19:39,617 --> 00:19:41,083
I'm gone! (laughs)

867
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:41,916
Oh, that's heavy.

868
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:44,399
- Now this needs a royal procession, bro!

869
00:19:44,399 --> 00:19:45,232
- What?

870
00:19:45,232 --> 00:19:46,129
Dude, what?

871
00:19:46,129 --> 00:19:47,032
You got a ladder, bro?

872
00:19:47,032 --> 00:19:47,865
- Yes I did.

873
00:19:47,865 --> 00:19:48,698
- That is against the rules.

874
00:19:48,698 --> 00:19:49,927
- What rules, dude?

875
00:19:49,927 --> 00:19:52,082
- There is one rule, no ladders.

876
00:19:52,082 --> 00:19:52,970
- Well, you made that rule

877
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:54,385
after I brought out the ladder,

878
00:19:54,385 --> 00:19:56,114
so therefore it is void.

879
00:19:56,114 --> 00:19:56,947
Here we go!

880
00:19:56,947 --> 00:19:57,781
- You need help at all, climbing that ladder?

881
00:19:57,781 --> 00:19:59,216
- No, I'm my own dude, bro!

882
00:19:59,216 --> 00:20:00,049
I got this.

883
00:20:00,049 --> 00:20:00,882
- Show his stats.

884
00:20:00,882 --> 00:20:04,064
(rock music)

885
00:20:04,064 --> 00:20:05,266
- Alright, just gotta bring it up.

886
00:20:05,266 --> 00:20:06,099
- Oh my gosh.

887
00:20:06,099 --> 00:20:07,914
You gotta be super careful with that bucket, bro.

888
00:20:07,914 --> 00:20:09,160
- I am very careful!

889
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,210
You ready for this bro?

890
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,043
- Not really, but I mean,

891
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,510
like, hey, it's gonna be pretty fun, right?

892
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:14,579
And do not try this at home!

893
00:20:14,579 --> 00:20:15,428
Slime dump!

894
00:20:15,428 --> 00:20:16,928
- Three, two, one!

895
00:20:22,149 --> 00:20:24,047
(both shouting)

896
00:20:24,047 --> 00:20:25,984
- Oh my gosh, bro, it is so cold!

897
00:20:25,984 --> 00:20:28,581
Oh my gosh bro, that was a direct hit!

898
00:20:28,581 --> 00:20:30,019
- That was perfect.

899
00:20:30,019 --> 00:20:30,852
- Give me a hug!

900
00:20:30,852 --> 00:20:32,215
- Oh no, no, no.

901
00:20:32,215 --> 00:20:33,048
No hugs!

902
00:20:33,048 --> 00:20:34,976
- That was the coolest slime dump we've ever done!

903
00:20:34,976 --> 00:20:35,809
And now it's your turn, Devan.

904
00:20:35,809 --> 00:20:36,642
Here we go!

905
00:20:36,642 --> 00:20:37,827
- Whoa no, no, no!

00:20:37,827 --> 00:20:39,664
