00:00:00,058 --> 00:00:01,808
- What's up everyone, it is Collins Key

2
00:00:01,808 --> 00:00:03,597
and welcome to the Thursday vlog.

3
00:00:03,597 --> 00:00:05,020
Today I'm joined here with Teala.

4
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:06,118
- Hi.

5
00:00:06,118 --> 00:00:07,910
- She has a beauty guru channel.

6
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:08,743
- Yes.

7
00:00:08,743 --> 00:00:10,514
- I'm a big watcher of the beauty guru channels--

8
00:00:10,514 --> 00:00:11,347
- Clearly--

9
00:00:11,347 --> 00:00:13,085
- If you guys couldn't tell by the eyeliner.

10
00:00:13,085 --> 00:00:15,488
- You're like winged eyeliner, you got some blush going on.

11
00:00:15,488 --> 00:00:16,666
It's on point guys.

12
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:17,599
- I actually have no idea about

13
00:00:17,599 --> 00:00:18,781
any of that stuff you just said.

14
00:00:18,781 --> 00:00:20,862
Today we are doing two truths and

15
00:00:20,862 --> 00:00:23,059
- [Together] One lie - Challenge.

16
00:00:23,059 --> 00:00:24,364
How this challenge works.

17
00:00:24,364 --> 00:00:27,054
- You say three things and two of them are truths

18
00:00:27,054 --> 00:00:30,067
and one of them is a lie, and if we get the lie correct

19
00:00:30,067 --> 00:00:31,779
then the person gets one point.

20
00:00:31,779 --> 00:00:32,612
- Okay.

21
00:00:32,612 --> 00:00:34,096
- And if the other person doesn't get that correct,

22
00:00:34,096 --> 00:00:35,278
they lose.

23
00:00:35,278 --> 00:00:37,316
- [Together] Oh!

24
00:00:37,316 --> 00:00:38,292
- The winner gets to tweet something

25
00:00:38,292 --> 00:00:39,830
off of the loser's phone.

26
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:41,020
Cool, let's do it.

27
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,197
I'm gonna go first.

28
00:00:42,197 --> 00:00:43,379
I can do a double front flip.

29
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:45,369
I've been stung by a bee 14 times in a row.

30
00:00:45,369 --> 00:00:48,221
And a fan tried to eat my key necklace at a meet and greet.

31
00:00:48,221 --> 00:00:50,054
I tried to pick the best ones possible.

32
00:00:50,054 --> 00:00:51,683
- What?

33
00:00:51,683 --> 00:00:53,308
These are crazy.

34
00:00:53,308 --> 00:00:54,940
You've not been stung by a bee 14--

35
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,204
- No, how did you get that?

36
00:00:56,204 --> 00:00:57,037
- Really?

37
00:00:57,037 --> 00:00:57,870
- What?

38
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:58,905
I should have gone for like six.

39
00:00:58,905 --> 00:01:00,085
- 14 times, that's like, (laughing)

40
00:01:00,085 --> 00:01:01,344
'cause like what if you were allergic,

41
00:01:01,344 --> 00:01:02,563
you would've like died.

42
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:03,824
- Just like (convulses).

43
00:01:03,824 --> 00:01:05,003
I got stung on my middle finger one time,

44
00:01:05,003 --> 00:01:05,836
- Really?

45
00:01:05,836 --> 00:01:07,534
- I didn't know what it was, so I was like whaaa.

46
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:09,080
- Yes, one point for Teala.

47
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,303
Okay, here's my turn.

48
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:12,053
I've been the same sue shies--

49
00:01:12,053 --> 00:01:13,639
- [Together] Shoe shies?

50
00:01:13,639 --> 00:01:15,347
- I've been the same sue--

51
00:01:15,347 --> 00:01:16,650
- Haha, you did it again.

52
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:17,505
- I can't do it.

53
00:01:17,505 --> 00:01:21,526
I've been the same shoe size since I was 12 years old.

54
00:01:21,526 --> 00:01:23,723
I still have a Club Penguin account.

55
00:01:23,723 --> 00:01:25,351
I had a pet hamster when I was nine years old.

56
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:26,448
- I've been like the same shoe size

57
00:01:26,448 --> 00:01:27,669
since I was around that age, so I think

58
00:01:27,669 --> 00:01:29,014
I'm gonna say that's a truth.

59
00:01:29,014 --> 00:01:30,437
I think our feet develop faster.

60
00:01:30,437 --> 00:01:32,024
I'm just making that up, I have actually no idea.

61
00:01:32,024 --> 00:01:35,192
But actually-- - Actually, the fact is--

62
00:01:35,192 --> 00:01:36,857
- You're actively on Club Penguin,

63
00:01:36,857 --> 00:01:38,363
or you just never deleted, you're actively,

64
00:01:38,363 --> 00:01:41,185
that's a lie, you're not actively on Club Penguin.

65
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:43,662
What the heck, is that for real?

66
00:01:43,662 --> 00:01:45,493
- Yes, last time I was on Club Penguin

67
00:01:45,493 --> 00:01:48,627
was like a month ago, but that's still pretty active.

68
00:01:48,627 --> 00:01:49,685
- That's pretty active.

69
00:01:49,685 --> 00:01:51,149
- No shame my people. - That's crazy.

70
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:52,371
- The lie was that I had a pet hamster.

71
00:01:52,371 --> 00:01:53,668
I did not have a pet hamster.

72
00:01:53,668 --> 00:01:55,213
- Okay so that's two points for Teala.

73
00:01:55,213 --> 00:01:56,192
Man, I am losing.

74
00:01:56,192 --> 00:01:58,609
I threw a rock and hit a car.

75
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:01,413
I was detained at the airport.

76
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:02,351
- What's detained?

77
00:02:02,351 --> 00:02:03,940
- Like, taken in the backroom.

78
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,124
- Oh, okay.

79
00:02:05,124 --> 00:02:06,835
- When I was eight years old, I fell out of a tree

80
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,219
because I was dressed as a tiger.

81
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:10,345
- I believe the last one.

82
00:02:10,345 --> 00:02:13,178
It just sounds something that Collins would do.

83
00:02:13,178 --> 00:02:14,238
- Hope this works.

84
00:02:14,238 --> 00:02:15,619
- You didn't get detained at the airport.

85
00:02:15,619 --> 00:02:16,800
- No, what the heck.

86
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,633
- Is that true?

87
00:02:17,633 --> 00:02:18,466
- Yes.

88
00:02:18,466 --> 00:02:20,301
- I am so good at this game.

89
00:02:20,301 --> 00:02:21,401
- This is so sad.

90
00:02:21,401 --> 00:02:22,582
- This is pathetic.

91
00:02:22,582 --> 00:02:24,455
I'm allergic to cats.

92
00:02:24,455 --> 00:02:27,752
I was afraid of the little troll in Dora.

93
00:02:27,752 --> 00:02:30,759
When I was younger, I used to hate playgrounds.

94
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:33,445
Not hate them, but like I didn't like play on playgrounds.

95
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:34,788
- I don't even remember if there was a troll

96
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:36,252
in Dora the Explorer, so I--

97
00:02:36,252 --> 00:02:37,268
- There was.

98
00:02:37,268 --> 00:02:38,571
(whispers) There's a troll.

99
00:02:38,571 --> 00:02:39,914
- I remember, like, Boots

100
00:02:39,914 --> 00:02:41,624
(sings) Boots and Cats and Boots and Cats

101
00:02:41,624 --> 00:02:43,950
and Boots and Cats and Boots and Cats.

102
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,745
I'm gonna go with you're allergic to cats.

103
00:02:45,745 --> 00:02:46,600
Is that the lie?

104
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,821
- No, I am.

105
00:02:47,821 --> 00:02:49,136
- No.

106
00:02:49,136 --> 00:02:49,969
What the heck?

107
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:52,513
- The lie was that I hate playgrounds, I love playgrounds.

108
00:02:52,513 --> 00:02:53,369
- That's what I thought,

109
00:02:53,369 --> 00:02:54,794
I'm like, who doesn't love playgrounds?

110
00:02:54,794 --> 00:02:56,505
- Should've went with your first instinct.

111
00:02:56,505 --> 00:02:57,643
You have no points Collins.

112
00:02:57,643 --> 00:02:58,476
- This is terrible.

113
00:02:58,476 --> 00:02:59,309
- This is so bad

114
00:02:59,309 --> 00:03:00,415
Come on Collins.

115
00:03:00,415 --> 00:03:02,939
- I ran onstage and hugged Demi Lovato

116
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:04,363
in the middle of her show.

117
00:03:04,363 --> 00:03:06,887
I once ate 22 full plates of food at breakfast.

118
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:10,614
I pushed my friend off the swings and he broke his arm.

119
00:03:10,614 --> 00:03:12,766
- The lie is that you

120
00:03:12,766 --> 00:03:14,193
hugged Demi in the middle of a show.

121
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:15,026
- Nope.

122
00:03:15,026 --> 00:03:15,859
- Really?

123
00:03:15,859 --> 00:03:16,692
- That is not a lie.

124
00:03:16,692 --> 00:03:17,641
On the last show day,

125
00:03:17,641 --> 00:03:19,475
I ran onstage in the middle of Demi's set

126
00:03:19,475 --> 00:03:21,020
and I gave her a big hug.

127
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,039
- Oh I guess the lie is that

128
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,098
you pushed somebody off the swing.

129
00:03:23,098 --> 00:03:23,931
- Yep.

130
00:03:23,931 --> 00:03:25,044
- Dang it, I was gonna say that.

131
00:03:25,044 --> 00:03:25,983
- Yes, one point.

132
00:03:25,983 --> 00:03:27,573
- One point, one point.

133
00:03:27,573 --> 00:03:28,632
- Turn up for one point.

134
00:03:28,632 --> 00:03:30,218
I'm gonna put your little points over here,

135
00:03:30,218 --> 00:03:32,458
I'm gonna make my one just like super big over here.

136
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:34,905
So it's very clear that I have one point.

137
00:03:34,905 --> 00:03:35,920
I have one point.

138
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,060
All right, cool, your turn.

139
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,816
- I don't have an answering machine on my phone.

140
00:03:38,816 --> 00:03:40,531
I was always afraid of Chucky from Rugrats.

141
00:03:40,531 --> 00:03:42,527
I used to have a robot vacuum.

142
00:03:42,527 --> 00:03:43,914
- Yeah, I'm gonna call the lie on that.

143
00:03:43,914 --> 00:03:44,747
- The vacuum?

144
00:03:44,747 --> 00:03:45,580
- Yes, is it?

145
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:46,723
You've gotta be kidding me.

146
00:03:46,723 --> 00:03:48,597
- I had a robot vacuum.

147
00:03:48,597 --> 00:03:50,349
- This is messed up--

148
00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:51,934
- I literally had a ro, those like things

149
00:03:51,934 --> 00:03:52,830
that like talk--

150
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,941
- I know, but like it was so random.

151
00:03:54,941 --> 00:03:56,364
- That sounds so made up.

152
00:03:56,364 --> 00:03:57,426
- I really hope this one stumps you

153
00:03:57,426 --> 00:03:59,587
When I was young, we went camping and I got lost,

154
00:03:59,587 --> 00:04:01,986
it took the park rangers three hours to find me.

155
00:04:01,986 --> 00:04:05,323
I've gotten a back massage from a WWE fighter.

156
00:04:05,323 --> 00:04:07,892
My dad proposed to my mom on their first date.

157
00:04:07,892 --> 00:04:10,253
I so totally hope I get a point right now.

158
00:04:10,253 --> 00:04:12,086
- You probably did get lost at camping.

159
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:13,874
Knowing Collins.

160
00:04:13,874 --> 00:04:16,275
Your dad did not propose to your mom on the first date.

161
00:04:16,275 --> 00:04:17,132
- Yep, he did.

162
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:18,476
- What?

163
00:04:18,476 --> 00:04:19,698
- Yes, yeah yeah.

164
00:04:19,698 --> 00:04:21,896
My dad is a straight-up boss, like on their first date,

165
00:04:21,896 --> 00:04:24,009
he proposed to her and asked her to marry him.

166
00:04:24,009 --> 00:04:26,817
- What, that's ama-, that's crazy,

167
00:04:26,817 --> 00:04:28,486
I've never heard anything like that before.

168
00:04:28,486 --> 00:04:30,399
- And like 20-something years later, here they are.

169
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:31,781
Two points, oh yeah, woo.

170
00:04:31,781 --> 00:04:33,859
And the lie was that I got lost when I went camping.

171
00:04:33,859 --> 00:04:34,692
- Really?

172
00:04:34,692 --> 00:04:35,525
- Yep.

173
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:36,358
- I believed that.

174
00:04:36,358 --> 00:04:37,191
- Yeah.

175
00:04:37,191 --> 00:04:38,024
- 'Cause.

176
00:04:38,024 --> 00:04:38,857
- 'Cause, you know--

177
00:04:38,857 --> 00:04:39,690
- Collins is Collins--

178
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:40,523
- My favorite fact in that one was the fact

179
00:04:40,523 --> 00:04:42,114
that I got a backrub from a WWE fighter.

180
00:04:42,114 --> 00:04:42,947
Okay, your turn.

181
00:04:42,947 --> 00:04:44,275
- I'm still not allowed to play with matches.

182
00:04:44,275 --> 00:04:48,302
I used to have these, what I called, special rain boots,

183
00:04:48,302 --> 00:04:50,665
I thought they like gave me good luck.

184
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:51,844
- Is that what you're wearing right now?

185
00:04:51,844 --> 00:04:55,130
Are these your lucky rain boots?

186
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:56,067
- No.

187
00:04:56,067 --> 00:04:57,205
- You said you had the same shoe size

188
00:04:57,205 --> 00:04:58,508
since you were like nine or whatever,

189
00:04:58,508 --> 00:05:00,837
so these could be the lucky rain boots right now.

190
00:05:00,837 --> 00:05:02,390
- You never know guys.

191
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,612
- You never know these days.

192
00:05:03,612 --> 00:05:05,239
- I really jumped far for that conclusion.

193
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:06,255
- You really did.

194
00:05:06,255 --> 00:05:07,518
I can't have spicy foods,

195
00:05:07,518 --> 00:05:08,982
like I don't like hot sauce and stuff.

196
00:05:08,982 --> 00:05:10,324
- I think the lie is that you hate spicy foods,

197
00:05:10,324 --> 00:05:11,629
I don't think they bother you.

198
00:05:11,629 --> 00:05:12,462
Did I get it?

199
00:05:12,462 --> 00:05:13,316
- Yeah, you got it.

200
00:05:13,316 --> 00:05:14,744
- Yes, finally.

201
00:05:14,744 --> 00:05:18,203
I kept a black widow spider as a pet.

202
00:05:18,203 --> 00:05:20,030
I was Spiderman for Halloween.

203
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:22,310
And I've been bitten by a brown recluse spider,

204
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,575
which they're like super poisonous.

205
00:05:23,575 --> 00:05:25,810
I tried to keep it all spider themed to really mess you up.

206
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:26,643
- Spider themed.

207
00:05:26,643 --> 00:05:27,519
- Spiders.

208
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:29,676
- I want to say that the lie

209
00:05:29,676 --> 00:05:34,152
is that you kept a black widow spider as a pet.

210
00:05:34,152 --> 00:05:37,000
No, you got bitten by it, was that the lie?

211
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,702
You dressed like Spiderman is the lie?

212
00:05:40,702 --> 00:05:42,046
What?

213
00:05:42,046 --> 00:05:42,981
- Never for Halloween.

214
00:05:42,981 --> 00:05:44,483
I dressed up as him on like normal days,

215
00:05:44,483 --> 00:05:45,506
but not, never Halloween.

216
00:05:45,506 --> 00:05:47,537
- What, that's even more random.

217
00:05:47,537 --> 00:05:48,370
- I know.

218
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,815
- I dress up as Spiderman on normal days.

219
00:05:49,815 --> 00:05:50,956
You kept a--

220
00:05:50,956 --> 00:05:52,581
- A black widow spider as a pet and--

221
00:05:52,581 --> 00:05:53,760
- Why would you ever?

222
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,755
- We actually kept, like, two, because one of them

223
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:57,178
we don't know what happened to it,

224
00:05:57,178 --> 00:05:58,154
which is kinda scary.

225
00:05:58,154 --> 00:05:59,821
But, we put it in like a jar.

226
00:05:59,821 --> 00:06:01,370
And we would have to like, literally,

227
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,122
find flies around the house and with the jar,

228
00:06:03,122 --> 00:06:05,645
unscrew the top and try to catch the fly under the jar.

229
00:06:05,645 --> 00:06:07,111

I'll put the link like right in front of her face.

237
00:06:19,803 --> 00:06:21,348
It's like magic, what?

238
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:22,528
- It's magic everybody.

239
00:06:22,528 --> 00:06:23,669

243
00:06:26,827 --> 00:06:28,641
Once again, I'm Collins Key, this was Teala Dunn

244
00:06:28,641 --> 00:06:30,761
This still is Teala Dunn, I don't know about was.
