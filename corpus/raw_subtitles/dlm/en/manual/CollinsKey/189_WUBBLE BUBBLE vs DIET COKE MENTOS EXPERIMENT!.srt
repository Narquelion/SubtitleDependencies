1
00:00:00,252 --> 00:00:01,472
- Let's go!

2
00:00:01,472 --> 00:00:02,968
- Wait, no, no, no, no, no! (Devan screaming)

3
00:00:02,968 --> 00:00:03,801
No, no!

4
00:00:04,995 --> 00:00:06,909
Bro come on, are you kidding me?

5
00:00:06,909 --> 00:00:07,945
We are doing an

6
00:00:07,945 --> 00:00:10,207
extreme Coke and Mentos video.

7
00:00:10,207 --> 00:00:12,164
We're starting off, we got a whole bunch of Coke here,

8
00:00:12,164 --> 00:00:13,232
a whole bunch of Mentos.

9
00:00:13,232 --> 00:00:14,540
We've also got some Wubbles.

10
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,268
We're gonna be starting off the smallest Wubble first,

11
00:00:16,268 --> 00:00:17,873
filling it all the way up with Coca Cola,

12
00:00:17,873 --> 00:00:19,428
and from there adding a ton of Mentos

13
00:00:19,428 --> 00:00:21,325
and just watching it go crazy, we're gonna go for

14
00:00:21,325 --> 00:00:23,067
a medium sized one and last but not least

15
00:00:23,067 --> 00:00:26,502
a full-sized Wubble filled with a ton of Coca-Cola,

16
00:00:26,502 --> 00:00:28,708
a ton of Mentos, to see what happens.

17
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:30,341
But before we get into it, we've got a challenge for you.

18
00:00:30,341 --> 00:00:32,033
We want to see if you guys can subscribe

19
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:33,759
to this channel and turn on the channel post

20
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:35,932
notifications in five seconds, here we go.

21
00:00:35,932 --> 00:00:39,246
- [Devon And Collins] Five, four, three, two, one.

22
00:00:39,246 --> 00:00:40,079
- Done.

23
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,029
If you can do that, comment down below

24
00:00:41,029 --> 00:00:42,918
Keyper Squad right now.

25
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:44,643
And at the very end of this, this super Wubble

26
00:00:44,643 --> 00:00:46,392
is exploding in someone's face.

27
00:00:46,392 --> 00:00:47,424
So make sure you guys stick around for that,

28
00:00:47,424 --> 00:00:50,090
but right now let's get into this video.

29
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:50,923
Yee!

30
00:00:50,923 --> 00:00:51,769
No I'm joking, I'm joking, I'm joking.

31
00:00:51,769 --> 00:00:53,590
Yee! (bottles clatter)

32
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:54,763
- Why, dude, why?

33
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:55,596
- It was impulse.

34
00:00:55,596 --> 00:00:56,653
Oh, we're off to a great start.

35
00:00:56,653 --> 00:00:57,486
No fail so far.

36
00:00:57,486 --> 00:00:58,319
We're gonna be starting off

37
00:00:58,319 --> 00:00:59,429
a little bit smaller with a balloon,

38
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:01,433
so Devon, if you wanna pop those open right now

39
00:01:01,433 --> 00:01:03,272
and just so you guys know, if you wanna try this at home,

40
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:06,278
it takes seven Mentos in one two-liter thing of Coca-Cola.

41
00:01:06,278 --> 00:01:08,828
I think it's Diet Coca-Cola that you wanna use.

42
00:01:08,828 --> 00:01:10,008
And as Devon demonstrated,

43
00:01:10,008 --> 00:01:12,021
yes, it will go crazy and it will go everywhere.

44
00:01:12,021 --> 00:01:14,271
(growling)

45
00:01:15,563 --> 00:01:16,676
You're gonna be filling up one of the balloons.

46
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:17,653
Should we go with the two-liter?

47
00:01:17,653 --> 00:01:18,519
I think we should, like, some of the little one.

48
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:19,436
- Yeah, let's do a little one.

49
00:01:19,436 --> 00:01:20,459
Yeah, let's do a little one.

50
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:23,042
(somber music)

51
00:01:24,512 --> 00:01:26,230
- Also, like, throughout this video, ha!

52
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,063
Oh.

53
00:01:27,063 --> 00:01:27,926
Ha!

54
00:01:27,926 --> 00:01:28,759
Oh.

55
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:29,592
Ha!

56
00:01:29,592 --> 00:01:30,425
Oh, man.

57
00:01:30,425 --> 00:01:31,863
I had this beautiful image in my mind of like

58
00:01:31,863 --> 00:01:33,184
it was going like whoo, and like go flying out

59
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:34,423
and me catching it and it'd be like ah!

60
00:01:34,423 --> 00:01:35,256
But it didn't work.

61
00:01:35,256 --> 00:01:36,214
Here we go, so what's gonna happen,

62
00:01:36,214 --> 00:01:37,113
we're gonna dump this in first.

63
00:01:37,113 --> 00:01:39,637
- All right, you got it? - Yeah, okay.

64
00:01:39,637 --> 00:01:40,470
Let's see here.

65
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:41,303
Oh no!

66
00:01:41,303 --> 00:01:42,373
- No! - Oh, no!

67
00:01:42,373 --> 00:01:43,206
- No!

68
00:01:43,206 --> 00:01:44,256
- I'm so sad it got shaken up

69
00:01:44,256 --> 00:01:45,758
before we could even put it in.

70
00:01:45,758 --> 00:01:48,402
- Wait, but is that gonna counteract the effects?

71
00:01:48,402 --> 00:01:49,235
Does it do that?

72
00:01:49,235 --> 00:01:50,068
Is that a thing?

73
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:50,901
I don't know if that's a thing.

74
00:01:50,901 --> 00:01:51,880
- I don't think so, all right, here we go.

75
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,663
- I guess we'll find out. - We're gonna dump it in.

76
00:01:55,663 --> 00:01:56,679
It's not working.

77
00:01:56,679 --> 00:01:57,515
- Maybe we have to stretch it.

78
00:01:57,515 --> 00:01:58,522
- Yeah, yeah, stretch it, Devon, that's good.

79
00:01:58,522 --> 00:01:59,530
Okay, here we go.

80
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:00,363
What, another one?

81
00:02:00,363 --> 00:02:01,196
How did, did I shake this?

82
00:02:01,196 --> 00:02:02,341
I probably, oh, I tried to throw 'em.

83
00:02:02,341 --> 00:02:03,174
That like shook 'em all up.

84
00:02:03,174 --> 00:02:04,007
- Oh that's right. - That was not a good idea.

85
00:02:04,007 --> 00:02:05,467
Ha, ha, ha! (buzzer)

86
00:02:05,467 --> 00:02:06,300
All right, you ready?

87
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,133
- Yeah, I guess.

88
00:02:07,133 --> 00:02:10,310
(upbeat music)

89
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,143
- Ha!

90
00:02:11,143 --> 00:02:11,976
Oh, I thought.

91
00:02:11,976 --> 00:02:13,168
You spilled it.

92
00:02:13,168 --> 00:02:15,962
How does it? - I don't know.

93
00:02:15,962 --> 00:02:16,795
- Huh?

94
00:02:16,795 --> 00:02:18,021
All right, let me see, oh, I know what I need to do.

95
00:02:18,021 --> 00:02:19,899
You need to actually stretch the balloon out first.

96
00:02:19,899 --> 00:02:20,906
- Oh.

97
00:02:20,906 --> 00:02:23,739
(balloon hissing)

98
00:02:24,754 --> 00:02:25,932
- You can get rid of that one, bro.

99
00:02:25,932 --> 00:02:27,223
- What do I do with it? (laughs)

100
00:02:27,223 --> 00:02:28,056
- I don't know.

101
00:02:28,056 --> 00:02:29,447
(air horn honks)

102
00:02:29,447 --> 00:02:30,280
Drink it.

103
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,301
- All right.

104
00:02:31,301 --> 00:02:34,666
(ballon hissing)

105
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:36,294
(balloon hissing)

106
00:02:36,294 --> 00:02:37,916
I'm really concerned right now.

107
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:38,988
(balloon sputtering)

108
00:02:38,988 --> 00:02:39,821
- Whoa!

109
00:02:39,821 --> 00:02:41,046
- No! - No, no, no, no, no, no!

110
00:02:41,046 --> 00:02:41,879
- Not in the rose bushes! - Bushes!

111
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,161
We got it, fam! (laughs)

112
00:02:43,161 --> 00:02:44,267
That was close.

113
00:02:44,267 --> 00:02:45,382
All right, Devon's gonna be opening up that.

114
00:02:45,382 --> 00:02:46,530
We got two more Coca-Colas,

115
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,040
gonna do like a quick little like open.

116
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:48,988
Yah!

117
00:02:48,988 --> 00:02:49,822
(bell dinging)

118
00:02:49,822 --> 00:02:50,780
All right, here we go.

119
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,615
You ready? - I think so.

120
00:02:51,615 --> 00:02:52,448
All right, I got it.

121
00:02:52,448 --> 00:02:53,550
- This one here should go better now

122
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,383
because it's all stretched out

123
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:55,546
so let's give it a shot.

124
00:02:55,546 --> 00:02:56,713
(upbeat music)

125
00:02:56,713 --> 00:02:57,790
No, I don't think that it--

126
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:58,886
- I think it is going better.

127
00:02:58,886 --> 00:03:01,765
- It's better, but like it's not best yet.

128
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:02,731
If you know what I mean-- - 'Cause nothing's.

129
00:03:02,731 --> 00:03:03,564
Oh, wait, hold on.

130
00:03:03,564 --> 00:03:04,397
- Oh, it's not even filled up yet.

131
00:03:04,397 --> 00:03:05,614
- It's like a heart. - Oh, okay it's working.

132
00:03:05,614 --> 00:03:06,619
I'm gonna grab it like this and just kind of

133
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:07,702
stretch it out.

134
00:03:07,702 --> 00:03:08,535
- It better not break.

135
00:03:08,535 --> 00:03:09,686
- So we're gonna add a little bit more Coca-Cola.

136
00:03:09,686 --> 00:03:11,503
(upbeat music)

137
00:03:11,503 --> 00:03:13,340
- That works a lot better for sure.

138
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,903
- Yep, see if we stretch it out, absorb it.

139
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:15,736
Oh!

140
00:03:15,736 --> 00:03:16,569
Dude, it's drinking it!

141
00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:17,538
It's like empty on the top.

142
00:03:17,538 --> 00:03:18,371
Dude, check this out! - No!

143
00:03:18,371 --> 00:03:19,204
- Come here, look at this!

144
00:03:19,204 --> 00:03:20,037
It's actually like taking it, dude.

145
00:03:20,037 --> 00:03:21,168
'Cause see if I like stretch out the balloon,

146
00:03:21,168 --> 00:03:22,224
it like opens up space

147
00:03:22,224 --> 00:03:23,535
and it takes more of it.

148
00:03:23,535 --> 00:03:25,300
All right, Devon, remove it on the count of three.

149
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,133
You ready?

150
00:03:26,133 --> 00:03:27,841
One, two, three.

151
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:28,674
- Got it.

152
00:03:28,674 --> 00:03:29,521
Got on me.

153
00:03:29,521 --> 00:03:31,996
- Perfect, so now we have our first balloon

154
00:03:31,996 --> 00:03:33,919
and now it's time to add the Mentos

155
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,493
so Devon, if you wanna get that prepared.

156
00:03:35,493 --> 00:03:38,536
This thing just like sags, bro. (laughs)

157
00:03:38,536 --> 00:03:39,745
- Wait, hit it on the table.

158
00:03:39,745 --> 00:03:40,578
(balloon thuds)

159
00:03:40,578 --> 00:03:41,712
(laughter)

160
00:03:41,712 --> 00:03:43,804
- It's like a giant earlobe bro.

161
00:03:43,804 --> 00:03:44,637
Hilarious, fam!

162
00:03:44,637 --> 00:03:45,595
Here we go, I have an idea. (bell dings)

163
00:03:45,595 --> 00:03:47,190
You have to remove the finger.

164
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,023
(ballon snaps)

165
00:03:48,023 --> 00:03:49,501
- What, what, what?

166
00:03:49,501 --> 00:03:50,334
- Ow.

167
00:03:50,334 --> 00:03:51,167
- What are you doing, bro?

168
00:03:51,167 --> 00:03:52,000
- I have an idea!

169
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,833
- Let me do this.

170
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:53,693
Let me do this. - This is ingenuity.

171
00:03:53,693 --> 00:03:54,732
- No, no, stop. (laughs)

172
00:03:54,732 --> 00:03:55,852
- So I've been given the Mentos duty.

173
00:03:55,852 --> 00:03:56,685
Oh, I have an idea.

174
00:03:56,685 --> 00:03:57,575
Dude, I got it, I got it, I got it.

175
00:03:57,575 --> 00:03:59,414
- I don't think there's any way to open it.

176
00:03:59,414 --> 00:04:00,247
- I know what we're doing.

177
00:04:00,247 --> 00:04:01,080
- What are we doing?

178
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,913
You're letting it go.

179
00:04:01,913 --> 00:04:02,746
What are you doing?

180
00:04:02,746 --> 00:04:03,678
- Just let go! - No!

181
00:04:03,678 --> 00:04:04,511
- Be a man!

182
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:05,382
(growling)

183
00:04:05,382 --> 00:04:06,489
Okay, there we go, hold onto this.

184
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:07,322
- Okay.

185
00:04:07,322 --> 00:04:08,845
- We're gonna stick the tube in the top of this.

186
00:04:08,845 --> 00:04:09,678
- Okay.

187
00:04:09,678 --> 00:04:11,262
- And then just like let it all kind of fall in.

188
00:04:11,262 --> 00:04:12,095
All right, here we go.

189
00:04:12,095 --> 00:04:13,537
Three, two, one, add 'em in, add 'em in.

190
00:04:13,537 --> 00:04:14,713
Dump 'em, dump 'em, dump 'em, dump 'em!

191
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:15,546
- No, we lost one!

192
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:16,494
We have a casualty.

193
00:04:16,494 --> 00:04:17,803
- I mean, we're improvising, guys.

194
00:04:17,803 --> 00:04:18,681
We're gonna give this a shot.

195
00:04:18,681 --> 00:04:19,514
- Want me to turn it upside down.

196
00:04:19,514 --> 00:04:21,815
- Here, three, two, one, here, upside down.

197
00:04:21,815 --> 00:04:22,648
- [Devon] Whoa!

198
00:04:22,648 --> 00:04:23,935
What?

199
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,102
- Shake it up!

200
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,228
(screams)

201
00:04:28,228 --> 00:04:30,478
(laughter)

202
00:04:32,533 --> 00:04:33,366
(screaming) - Round two!

203
00:04:33,366 --> 00:04:34,347
- Let's go!

204
00:04:34,347 --> 00:04:35,180
(high-pitched wailing)

205
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,378
So for this one, we have to utilize

206
00:04:36,378 --> 00:04:37,663
the funnel technique right here

207
00:04:37,663 --> 00:04:39,271
which basically, you stick a funnel inside of

208
00:04:39,271 --> 00:04:40,198
the medium sized Wubble.

209
00:04:40,198 --> 00:04:41,543
While he is doing that, I've got something

210
00:04:41,543 --> 00:04:43,346
I've always wanted to try, which is putting Mentos

211
00:04:43,346 --> 00:04:45,220
in my mouth and then filling it up with Coca-Cola.

212
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,916
So as you do that, I'm gonna try this.

213
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:47,749
- What? - I don't know.

214
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:48,642
We'll see what happens. - All right.

215
00:04:48,642 --> 00:04:49,737
(upbeat music)

216
00:04:49,737 --> 00:04:51,329
- Ah, this is delicious.

217
00:04:51,329 --> 00:04:52,662
I love this.

218
00:04:52,662 --> 00:04:54,449
Oh, my, (gags)

219
00:04:54,449 --> 00:04:56,007
(laughter)

220
00:04:56,007 --> 00:04:58,939
- I can smell it from here.

221
00:04:58,939 --> 00:04:59,772
- Three.

222
00:05:01,022 --> 00:05:02,128
Two.

223
00:05:02,128 --> 00:05:02,961
- I'm putting this down.

224
00:05:02,961 --> 00:05:03,835
I wanna watch this.

225
00:05:03,835 --> 00:05:05,408
- One.

226
00:05:05,408 --> 00:05:08,332
(soda hissing) (laughter)

227
00:05:08,332 --> 00:05:10,516
(Collins spits)

228
00:05:10,516 --> 00:05:11,349
(Devon laughs)

229
00:05:11,349 --> 00:05:13,204
(soda hissing)

230
00:05:13,204 --> 00:05:16,932
Dude, my mouth straight up feels so fresh right now.

231
00:05:16,932 --> 00:05:17,843
Like, so fresh, bro.

232
00:05:17,843 --> 00:05:20,456
It's like the North Pole is in my mouth at the moment, bro.

233
00:05:20,456 --> 00:05:22,490
Like, I'm just breathing icicles, like ah!

234
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,115
All right, guys, I want to try this one more time.

235
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:25,164
Take it to the next level

236
00:05:25,164 --> 00:05:27,056
and this time I'm gonna like tilt my head upwards

237
00:05:27,056 --> 00:05:28,453
as I put the Coca-Cola in my mouth

238
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,937
and maybe just like, I don't know, shoots in the sky

239
00:05:30,937 --> 00:05:32,318
like a giant volcano of awesomeness.

240
00:05:32,318 --> 00:05:33,151
Here we go.

241
00:05:33,151 --> 00:05:33,984
Ow! (laughter)

242
00:05:33,984 --> 00:05:35,629
It popped out onto my eyeball.

243
00:05:35,629 --> 00:05:36,544
Oh!

244
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:37,571
(yells)

245
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:39,821
(laughter)

246
00:05:42,537 --> 00:05:44,861
(soda hissing)

247
00:05:44,861 --> 00:05:46,861
(spits)

248
00:05:47,816 --> 00:05:48,770
(coughing)

249
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,175
It went in my nose!

250
00:05:50,175 --> 00:05:51,008
It burns!

251
00:05:51,008 --> 00:05:51,841
It burns a lot!

252
00:05:51,841 --> 00:05:52,882
Well, I guess that was everything

253
00:05:52,882 --> 00:05:54,469
I wanted it to be and more, so.

254
00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:55,321
- Splash guard.

255
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:56,595
- I'm sorry, Devon, I'm so soaked at this point,

256
00:05:56,595 --> 00:05:57,586
it doesn't really matter.

257
00:05:57,586 --> 00:05:58,419
(Devon laughs)

258
00:05:58,419 --> 00:05:59,252
All right, perfect.

259
00:05:59,252 --> 00:06:00,085
There we go, yay!

260
00:06:00,085 --> 00:06:00,918
All right, let's go for the next one.

261
00:06:00,918 --> 00:06:02,627
- Yo, this thing is gonna break.

262
00:06:02,627 --> 00:06:03,600
It's burping, what?

263
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,637
(Collins laughs) (burping)

264
00:06:04,637 --> 00:06:05,528
Why is it burping?

265
00:06:05,528 --> 00:06:06,639
- I feel like Salt Bae.

266
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,472
Oh!

267
00:06:08,597 --> 00:06:10,927
(laughter)

268
00:06:10,927 --> 00:06:12,596
Yay, alright, let's go for the next one.

269
00:06:12,596 --> 00:06:13,429
Oops.

270
00:06:13,429 --> 00:06:15,178
- Whoa, bro.

271
00:06:15,178 --> 00:06:16,762
There's little bubbles in the Wubble.

272
00:06:16,762 --> 00:06:17,709
This is insane.

273
00:06:17,709 --> 00:06:19,008
Wait, look at this!

274
00:06:19,008 --> 00:06:21,643
I think it's having some weird reaction to the Coke.

275
00:06:21,643 --> 00:06:22,476
- [Collins] Oh my gosh!

276
00:06:22,476 --> 00:06:23,309
- [Devon] Look at that.

277
00:06:23,309 --> 00:06:24,142
- That's enough Coca-Cola.

278
00:06:24,142 --> 00:06:26,133
Yay, yay, yay, yay!

279
00:06:26,133 --> 00:06:27,483
So right now (laughs) next

280
00:06:27,483 --> 00:06:29,461
we are gonna be moving on. - That rose bush is gone.

281
00:06:29,461 --> 00:06:30,294
(Collins laughs)

282
00:06:30,294 --> 00:06:31,487
- We are moving on to the Mentos.

283
00:06:31,487 --> 00:06:33,476
I literally got it in my eye again.

284
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:34,725
We're gonna fill up one of these Mentos bags

285
00:06:34,725 --> 00:06:35,661
with a whole bunch of Mentos

286
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:37,234
and then dump it in here and see

287
00:06:37,234 --> 00:06:39,027
what kind of crazy reaction happens.

288
00:06:39,027 --> 00:06:40,316
(Devon mumbles) This is gonna be crazy.

289
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:41,194
- It's gonna be insane.

290
00:06:41,194 --> 00:06:42,174
- Here we go, three, two, one, you ready?

291
00:06:42,174 --> 00:06:43,521
(Mentos plopping into Coke)

292
00:06:43,521 --> 00:06:44,854
- Oh!

293
00:06:44,854 --> 00:06:46,894
(crickets chirping)

294
00:06:46,894 --> 00:06:47,846
(hand slapping Wubble)

295
00:06:47,846 --> 00:06:48,679
Oh!

296
00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:49,784
(laughter)

297
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:50,617
Bro! - Ow!

298
00:06:50,617 --> 00:06:52,037
- What the heck?

299
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:52,903
- I've got an idea.

300
00:06:52,903 --> 00:06:54,065
Actually, you know what I think would be really fun?

301
00:06:54,065 --> 00:06:56,874
We're gonna do one more of the smaller ones first

302
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,988
and we're gonna see if we can do a good all like

303
00:06:58,988 --> 00:07:00,191
roundhouse kick on it

304
00:07:00,191 --> 00:07:01,817
and see if we can break it midair right now.

305
00:07:01,817 --> 00:07:03,830
We're gonna fast forward and go right to the kick

306
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:04,918
so let's do this right now.

307
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:06,375
All right, guys, this is Devon's payback.

308
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:07,208
- All right. - Here we go.

309
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:08,041
- Here we go.

310
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,203
(Wubble explodes) (Devon and Collins exclaim)

311
00:07:10,203 --> 00:07:12,550
(Wubble explodes)

312
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,391
(growling)

313
00:07:14,391 --> 00:07:16,495
Look, my foot is like completely soaked.

314
00:07:16,495 --> 00:07:17,328
(Collins laughs)

315
00:07:17,328 --> 00:07:18,223
- All right, you guys, here we go.

316
00:07:18,223 --> 00:07:19,839
We are onto the main event, the massive Wubble.

317
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:20,911
- No, no, no!

318
00:07:20,911 --> 00:07:21,744
- But right now--

319
00:07:21,744 --> 00:07:24,235
- No, no, no, no, no, no! (laughs)

320
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:25,068
No!

321
00:07:25,068 --> 00:07:26,391
I literally already got soaked!

322
00:07:26,391 --> 00:07:27,224
(Collins laughs)

323
00:07:27,224 --> 00:07:28,057
- Let's get to it!

324
00:07:28,057 --> 00:07:29,390
Yay!

325
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,409
(laughter)

326
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:31,335
- No!

327
00:07:31,335 --> 00:07:32,287
(Collins laughs)

328
00:07:32,287 --> 00:07:33,120
- Let's do it.

329
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,953
(Collins exclaims)

330
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:34,786
You little booger!

331
00:07:34,786 --> 00:07:35,619
No!

332
00:07:35,619 --> 00:07:36,452
No, no!

333
00:07:36,452 --> 00:07:37,285
(Devon giggles)

334
00:07:37,285 --> 00:07:39,952
(clock ticking)

335
00:07:44,948 --> 00:07:46,906
- Yo, this thing is huge.

336
00:07:46,906 --> 00:07:48,073
- Huge! - Huge.

337
00:07:50,691 --> 00:07:51,599
All right, guys.

338
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,237
I'm about to pull the craziest prank on Collins right now.

339
00:07:54,237 --> 00:07:56,866
He just went inside to get a whole bunch more Mentos.

340
00:07:56,866 --> 00:07:58,978
Little does he know when he comes back,

341
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,245
I got a surprise for him.

342
00:08:00,245 --> 00:08:02,030
- [Collins] Oh, got all these Mentos, all right, cool.

343
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:02,863
- Yo, what's up?

344
00:08:02,863 --> 00:08:03,696
- Here we go.

345
00:08:03,696 --> 00:08:04,613
So we got, all right guys,

346
00:08:04,613 --> 00:08:05,446
so we got a whole bunch more Mentos.

347
00:08:05,446 --> 00:08:07,037
We also have a giant bowl of Mentos right now.

348
00:08:07,037 --> 00:08:09,087
We're about to add it to the giant Wubble.

349
00:08:09,087 --> 00:08:09,920
So here's the game plan.

350
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,875
I'm gonna hold it and then you dump all the Mentos in.

351
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:12,708
All right?

352
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:13,541
All right here we go.

353
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:14,648
We got it open, you ready for this, Devon?

354
00:08:14,648 --> 00:08:15,481
- Better close your eyes.

355
00:08:15,481 --> 00:08:16,314
Better close your eyes.

356
00:08:16,314 --> 00:08:17,973
- All right here we go, three, two.

357
00:08:17,973 --> 00:08:20,067
Oh no, no, no. (Devon exclaiming)

358
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:21,238
Oh my god!

359
00:08:21,238 --> 00:08:23,020
- Bro, this is crazy!

360
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:25,603
(upbeat music)

361
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,183
- It worked, it worked! - Dude, look at it!

362
00:08:39,183 --> 00:08:41,713
- It worked, it worked! - Look at it, look at it!

363
00:08:41,713 --> 00:08:42,546
- Huh?

364
00:08:42,546 --> 00:08:43,379
- Whoa! (laughs) - Oh my god, no!

365
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:44,905
No, dude, you, it was this stuff?

366
00:08:44,905 --> 00:08:46,100
(Devon laughs and exclaims)

367
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,453
No, dude I am getting you back right now.

368
00:08:47,453 --> 00:08:48,620
No, oh my god!

369
00:08:49,941 --> 00:08:52,949
- Oh my god! (Wubble slaps Devon)

370
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,265
(growling)

371
00:08:55,265 --> 00:08:56,313
(heavy slap)

372
00:08:56,313 --> 00:08:57,578
That so backfired.

373
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:58,484
What?

374
00:08:58,484 --> 00:08:59,317
No!

375
00:08:59,317 --> 00:09:00,150
(items clatter)

376
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:00,983
- Well that's the video, guys.

377
00:09:00,983 --> 00:09:02,084
Love you all so much.

378
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:02,917
You guys wanna see. - Woohoo!

379
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:03,750
- I love you all so much.

380
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,083
I'm cold.

381
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,031
I'll see you on the inside. (screams)

382
00:09:06,031 --> 00:09:06,864
No!

383
00:09:06,864 --> 00:09:07,697
Bye!

384
00:09:07,697 --> 00:09:08,530
(bell dings)

385
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:11,113
(upbeat music)

386
00:09:55,198 --> 00:09:56,210
Hey! - Let's go!

387
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,103
- What?

388
00:09:57,103 --> 00:09:57,963
(Mentos plops into soda)

389
00:09:57,963 --> 00:09:59,007
Oh. - Wait, wait.

390
00:09:59,007 --> 00:09:59,840
- Dude, dude, dude, dude. - Well that was lame.

391
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,673
- Dude, that was so weird. - Yay!
