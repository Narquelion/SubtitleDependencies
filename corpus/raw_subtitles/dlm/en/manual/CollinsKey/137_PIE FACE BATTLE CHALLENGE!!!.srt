1
00:00:00,361 --> 00:00:01,588
- What's up, it's Collins Key,

2
00:00:01,588 --> 00:00:02,586
and for this video

3
00:00:02,586 --> 00:00:04,057
I need someone very special to join me.

4
00:00:04,057 --> 00:00:04,890
So everyone please welcome

5
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,270
my brother, Devan.

6
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:07,328
Hey! - Hey!

7
00:00:07,328 --> 00:00:09,350
- Oh, dude, it's, sorry, I messed that up.

8
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:10,183
My bad.

9
00:00:10,183 --> 00:00:11,355
Hey! - Hey!

10
00:00:11,355 --> 00:00:12,416
What's up? - What's up guys?

11
00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:13,400
Today, we are going to be doing

12
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,308
the Pie Face Showdown.

13
00:00:15,308 --> 00:00:16,588
The only thing we are missing right now

14
00:00:16,588 --> 00:00:17,685
is a whole bunch of whipped cream,

15
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:19,212
so let me try this.

16
00:00:19,212 --> 00:00:20,295
Hey! - Hey!

17
00:00:20,295 --> 00:00:21,227
- All right guys.

18
00:00:21,227 --> 00:00:22,219
So we now have the whipped cream

19
00:00:22,219 --> 00:00:24,212
and here is how this challenge is going.

20
00:00:24,212 --> 00:00:26,939
There are seven extremely intense rounds.

21
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:29,356
And as with every video that we do on this channel,

22
00:00:29,356 --> 00:00:30,843
we are taking things to the next level.

23
00:00:30,843 --> 00:00:31,728
And we're not just gonna be gettin'

24
00:00:31,728 --> 00:00:32,649
hit in the face like just

25
00:00:32,649 --> 00:00:33,482
a little bit of whipped cream

26
00:00:33,482 --> 00:00:34,495
put on this little hand thing

27
00:00:34,495 --> 00:00:35,620
that smacks you in the face.

28
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:36,453
No.

29
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:38,995
We are getting hit in the face with a full pie,

30
00:00:38,995 --> 00:00:40,551
but we're missin' the crust,

31
00:00:40,551 --> 00:00:42,051
so give me one second.

32
00:00:42,051 --> 00:00:44,164
(clapping)

33
00:00:44,164 --> 00:00:46,096
Whoa! - Whoa, okay!

34
00:00:46,096 --> 00:00:47,493
- And there is one more twist.

35
00:00:47,493 --> 00:00:48,519
Each round, there is going to be

36
00:00:48,519 --> 00:00:50,018
(burping) a disgusting item

37
00:00:50,018 --> 00:00:52,267
mixed in to the whipped cream pie

38
00:00:52,267 --> 00:00:53,555
that is going to be smashed

39
00:00:53,555 --> 00:00:54,753
on the other person's face

40
00:00:54,753 --> 00:00:57,972
and the loser has to have their mouth open

41
00:00:57,972 --> 00:01:01,355
as the pie goes directly into their face.

42
00:01:01,355 --> 00:01:04,436
Whoever loses the most amount of rounds--

43
00:01:04,436 --> 00:01:05,434
- No.

44
00:01:05,434 --> 00:01:06,786
- They get hit in the face

45
00:01:06,786 --> 00:01:08,974
with the biggest pie of 'em all

46
00:01:08,974 --> 00:01:10,449
that has cocktail of

47
00:01:10,449 --> 00:01:12,655
every nasty ingredient used.

48
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:14,826
And so you do not wanna lose this challenge.

49
00:01:14,826 --> 00:01:16,937
That goes down at the end of this video.

50
00:01:16,937 --> 00:01:18,536
So make sure you guys stick around for that.

51
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:20,031
And also give this video a big thumbs up

52
00:01:20,031 --> 00:01:21,684
if you guys wanna see a Pie Face Challenge,

53
00:01:21,684 --> 00:01:23,896
only our entire body

54
00:01:23,896 --> 00:01:25,649
gets smacked with a giant pie.

55
00:01:25,649 --> 00:01:27,568
I wanna make the world's biggest pie

56
00:01:27,568 --> 00:01:29,394
and have a giant Pie Face Challenge.

57
00:01:29,394 --> 00:01:30,374
So if this video gets enough thumbs up

58
00:01:30,374 --> 00:01:31,955

let's jump into it right now.

79
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,482
And this is the Pie Face Showdown.

80
00:02:05,482 --> 00:02:07,230
- Nicely done. - Let's do it.

81
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,207
(bell dings) Round number one.

82
00:02:08,207 --> 00:02:09,136
We are kicking it off with something called

83
00:02:09,136 --> 00:02:10,906
mustard greens. - Ew.

84
00:02:10,906 --> 00:02:13,188
- Which does not look good to have in a.

85
00:02:13,188 --> 00:02:15,292
(sniffing)

86
00:02:15,292 --> 00:02:16,336
Oh. - Oh.

87
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:17,905
- That's not gonna be good

88
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:20,191
so I definitely want to win round number one.

89
00:02:20,191 --> 00:02:21,753
Somehow I got the girl cut-out.

90
00:02:21,753 --> 00:02:22,586
- I don't know how that happened.

91
00:02:22,586 --> 00:02:23,876
- Don't know how that happened, Devan?

92
00:02:23,876 --> 00:02:24,709
I just gotta win.

93
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:26,342
Gotta show that I've got some girl power.

94
00:02:26,342 --> 00:02:27,255
So what we're gonna do right now,

95
00:02:27,255 --> 00:02:28,422
we've got our.

96
00:02:30,214 --> 00:02:31,435
We can cut that out, right? (beep)

97
00:02:31,435 --> 00:02:32,592
So we've got our whipped cream,

98
00:02:32,592 --> 00:02:35,176
hey, hey - Nicely done.

99
00:02:35,176 --> 00:02:36,080
- All right here we go.

100
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,913
We've got the whipped cream.

101
00:02:36,913 --> 00:02:38,224
Gonna put this on there right now.

102
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:39,057
Oh. What? - What?

103
00:02:39,057 --> 00:02:39,890
Dude, you must have done something wrong.

104
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:41,144
- Let me try it like this.

105
00:02:41,144 --> 00:02:42,548
Whoa. - Whoa.

106
00:02:42,548 --> 00:02:43,652
(spray can hissing)

107
00:02:43,652 --> 00:02:44,624
- Why is it doing that?

108
00:02:44,624 --> 00:02:45,474
We've gotta go quickly.

109
00:02:45,474 --> 00:02:46,307
All right, here we go.

110
00:02:46,307 --> 00:02:47,214
So put our head in.

111
00:02:47,214 --> 00:02:48,047
Two, one, go.

112
00:02:48,047 --> 00:02:49,589
(game clacking)

113
00:02:49,589 --> 00:02:50,619
- No.

114
00:02:50,619 --> 00:02:51,970
(laughing) (bell dinging)

115
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:52,886
- I actually got so panicked

116
00:02:52,886 --> 00:02:53,889
during that first round

117
00:02:53,889 --> 00:02:55,072
I forgot which way it needed to go

118
00:02:55,072 --> 00:02:56,141
and so I saw it going that way

119
00:02:56,141 --> 00:02:57,131
and I'm like,

120
00:02:57,131 --> 00:02:58,722
it's going to hit me in the face.

121
00:02:58,722 --> 00:03:01,594
(tape squealing in reverse)

122
00:03:01,594 --> 00:03:02,515
All right, here we go, Devan.

123
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:03,484
You are going down.

124
00:03:03,484 --> 00:03:05,387
It's time to add this nastiness.

125
00:03:05,387 --> 00:03:06,220
- No. No.

126
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,593
- And bro, you have to keep your mouth open

127
00:03:07,593 --> 00:03:09,499
as this hits your face, remember.

128
00:03:09,499 --> 00:03:12,582
That's part of the rules here. - What?

129
00:03:13,615 --> 00:03:16,169
Oh. - Oh. (evil laugh)

130
00:03:16,169 --> 00:03:17,847
All right here we go, we're just gonna to mix it all around.

131
00:03:17,847 --> 00:03:18,689
Oh, jeez.

132
00:03:18,689 --> 00:03:20,267
- Oh, no!

133
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:21,655
I think I'm gonna throw up.

134
00:03:21,655 --> 00:03:22,916
- Oh, this is so gross.

135
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:24,010
Round number one.

136
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:24,843
Three.

137
00:03:24,843 --> 00:03:26,549
His foot's shaking, you guys can't see,

138
00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:27,899
his foot is shaking on the ground right now.

139
00:03:27,899 --> 00:03:29,110
Two.

140
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,943
One.

141
00:03:32,356 --> 00:03:35,535
(spitting and coughing)

142
00:03:35,535 --> 00:03:37,785
(laughing)

143
00:03:40,266 --> 00:03:41,433
This is gross.

144
00:03:43,611 --> 00:03:45,040
No, get off me.

145
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,873
No.

146
00:03:45,873 --> 00:03:47,994
- I think I might throw up.

147
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:51,177
Those two tastes just do not go well together.

148
00:03:51,177 --> 00:03:52,500
- All right, and now the first ingredient

149
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,563
goes into the massive pie right here.

150
00:03:54,563 --> 00:03:55,891
- I really hoping you get this.

151
00:03:55,891 --> 00:03:57,363
- The mustard greens-- - I'm hoping you get this.

152
00:03:57,363 --> 00:03:58,196
- Remember, whoever loses the most

153
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,284
has to get hit in the face

154
00:03:59,284 --> 00:04:00,871
with a cocktail of everything.

155
00:04:00,871 --> 00:04:02,981
I'm literally crying right now.

156
00:04:02,981 --> 00:04:04,497
Round number two.

157
00:04:04,497 --> 00:04:06,359
Let's get it. (bell dinging)

158
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:07,808
Now you know this wouldn't be a Key brothers

159
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:10,199
challenge without some eggs involved at some point.

160
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:11,779
So we have some eggs here.

161
00:04:11,779 --> 00:04:13,291
- That's true. - So the next pie is gonna be

162
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:14,288
whipped cream and eggs.

163
00:04:14,288 --> 00:04:16,367
And we've taken off the faces because, just, no.

164
00:04:16,367 --> 00:04:17,622
- Wait, I want to do this.

165
00:04:17,622 --> 00:04:19,262
- Okay fine, yeah, you kinda get to.

166
00:04:19,262 --> 00:04:20,597
Oh, jeez.

167
00:04:20,597 --> 00:04:22,193
Bro, that last one looked so nasty

168
00:04:22,193 --> 00:04:25,604
so I do not want to lose this at all.

169
00:04:25,604 --> 00:04:27,016
- I don't either, three, two, one, go.

170
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,892
(game clacking)

171
00:04:28,892 --> 00:04:30,208
- No.

172
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:31,315
No.

173
00:04:31,315 --> 00:04:32,148
- No!

174
00:04:34,326 --> 00:04:36,074
(bell dinging)

175
00:04:36,074 --> 00:04:37,168
Yes!

176
00:04:37,168 --> 00:04:38,115
Yes.

177
00:04:38,115 --> 00:04:39,215
I'm so ready.

178
00:04:39,215 --> 00:04:42,215
(spray can hissing)

179
00:04:45,474 --> 00:04:47,109
Oh.

180
00:04:47,109 --> 00:04:50,526
- [Collins] This is going to be so gross.

181
00:04:51,474 --> 00:04:52,307
So nasty.

182
00:04:54,536 --> 00:04:55,704
- Wait. (egg thuds)

183
00:04:55,704 --> 00:04:56,860
Oh, what?

184
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,055
That's not even part of the challenge.

185
00:04:59,055 --> 00:05:00,572
(laughing)

186
00:05:00,572 --> 00:05:01,530
- What are you doin'?

187
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,175
- It's the anticipation.

188
00:05:03,175 --> 00:05:04,735
Dude, what was that?

189
00:05:04,735 --> 00:05:06,269
- I'm sorry. - Bro.

190
00:05:06,269 --> 00:05:07,764
Uh uh.

191
00:05:07,764 --> 00:05:09,090
- Like, whenever I see eggs

192
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:10,089
there is just this feeling

193
00:05:10,089 --> 00:05:11,828
that I need to crack it on someone's head.

194
00:05:11,828 --> 00:05:13,460
Ew, it's all yolk-y.

195
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,664
The yolk's on me. (drum and symbol beat)

196
00:05:15,664 --> 00:05:17,275
We are now naming this the jackpot pie.

197
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,124
(slot machine bells)

198
00:05:18,124 --> 00:05:19,948
- So, before I hit him in the face with this pie

199
00:05:19,948 --> 00:05:22,085
I'm going to take a little bit of this

200
00:05:22,085 --> 00:05:25,248
since we don't have enough eggs left and just.

201
00:05:25,248 --> 00:05:26,081
Ew.

202
00:05:28,113 --> 00:05:31,288
- [Collins] It's like eggs that are like, half scrambled.

203
00:05:31,288 --> 00:05:32,718
So we've got some eggs shells as well.

204
00:05:32,718 --> 00:05:34,554
I'm just gonna add that for some flavor.

205
00:05:34,554 --> 00:05:35,970
- Is that gonna hurt if that hits your face?

206
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:36,803
- Do I have to do this?

207
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:38,138
It's just such bad-- - It has to be open.

208
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:38,971
Bro, open.

209
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:40,963
All right, three, two, one.

210
00:05:40,963 --> 00:05:42,954
- Ow, my nose.

211
00:05:42,954 --> 00:05:43,954
Ow, my nose.

212
00:05:47,344 --> 00:05:48,559
- No, you can not hit me.

213
00:05:48,559 --> 00:05:49,858
I did not hit you with that.

214
00:05:49,858 --> 00:05:52,068
You can not hit me with that. - Okay.

215
00:05:52,068 --> 00:05:53,358
Okay.

216
00:05:53,358 --> 00:05:54,597
All good.

217
00:05:54,597 --> 00:05:55,952
I'm all good.

218
00:05:55,952 --> 00:05:58,298
(saxophone jazz)

219
00:05:58,298 --> 00:05:59,131
(bell dinging) All right guys.

220
00:05:59,131 --> 00:06:00,747
This is round number three and we have.

221
00:06:00,747 --> 00:06:02,367
Oh. - Oh.

222
00:06:02,367 --> 00:06:05,170
- We have a whole sardines.

223
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:06,540
Like, we have a whole sardines.

224
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,697
I need to win this round.

225
00:06:07,697 --> 00:06:08,896
- I need to win this round.

226
00:06:08,896 --> 00:06:10,745
- I don't want a full sardine goin' in my mouth.

227
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:11,578
Here we go.

228
00:06:11,578 --> 00:06:12,653
This one, that one's done.

229
00:06:12,653 --> 00:06:13,675
All right, Devan if you could please reposition

230
00:06:13,675 --> 00:06:14,686
it back to the middle.

231
00:06:14,686 --> 00:06:15,519
- All right.

232
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:17,153
(spray can hissing)

233
00:06:17,153 --> 00:06:18,113
- May the best hand win.

234
00:06:18,113 --> 00:06:19,171
High five.

235
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:20,264
Psych. Okay, here we go.

236
00:06:20,264 --> 00:06:21,811
Three, two, one. - Three, two, one.

237
00:06:21,811 --> 00:06:23,308
(game clacking)

238
00:06:23,308 --> 00:06:24,420
- Oh no, it's too close to me.

239
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,253
No.

240
00:06:25,253 --> 00:06:26,253
No. Yes. - No.

241
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:27,086
- Yes.

242
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:27,919
Yes.

243
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,033
Yes. No.

244
00:06:29,033 --> 00:06:30,016
No.

245
00:06:30,016 --> 00:06:30,849
No. - No.

246
00:06:32,337 --> 00:06:33,425
- You have two hands.

247
00:06:33,425 --> 00:06:36,480
(bell dinging)

248
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,599
You had two hands, Devan.

249
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:40,636
- I used all resources to my ability.

250
00:06:40,636 --> 00:06:42,794
- I don't want a full sardine in my mouth.

251
00:06:42,794 --> 00:06:46,209
(spitting) (spray can hissing)

252
00:06:46,209 --> 00:06:48,072
- This is so nasty.

253
00:06:48,072 --> 00:06:49,253
- I'm so not excited.

254
00:06:49,253 --> 00:06:50,920
- That's a huge one.

255
00:06:52,114 --> 00:06:54,376
I'm already. Dude.

256
00:06:54,376 --> 00:06:55,571
With the sauce?

257
00:06:55,571 --> 00:06:56,759
That was unnecessary.

258
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:57,973
First he went with the two hands.

259
00:06:57,973 --> 00:06:58,920
Now he put the sauce in there.

260
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,984
Bro.

261
00:06:59,984 --> 00:07:01,239
Bruh.

262
00:07:01,239 --> 00:07:02,620
(gagging) The smell of it.

263
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,383
- This looks bad. - It's quite overpowering.

264
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:06,424
- This looks really, really bad.

265
00:07:06,424 --> 00:07:07,529
Ready? - No.

266
00:07:07,529 --> 00:07:09,048
- You gotta open up your mouth.

267
00:07:09,048 --> 00:07:10,349
You have to, bro.

268
00:07:10,349 --> 00:07:12,011
That's not open enough.

269
00:07:12,011 --> 00:07:13,599
Bro.

270
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,501
All right.

271
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:15,334
Three.

272
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:16,245
Two.

273
00:07:16,245 --> 00:07:18,412
(yelling)

274
00:07:20,186 --> 00:07:22,218
- It burns, it burns my eyes.

275
00:07:22,218 --> 00:07:24,468
(gurgling)

276
00:07:27,253 --> 00:07:29,633
- Okay, let's get paper towel then.

277
00:07:29,633 --> 00:07:31,021
I've got some paper towels. - Rescue.

278
00:07:31,021 --> 00:07:31,854
Rescue my face.

279
00:07:31,854 --> 00:07:32,784
It's actually burning my face.

280
00:07:32,784 --> 00:07:33,758
(yells)

281
00:07:33,758 --> 00:07:35,556
It went to my eyeball.

282
00:07:35,556 --> 00:07:37,055
- I think it's making it worse almost.

283
00:07:37,055 --> 00:07:38,163
- Yeah, it is, I know.

284
00:07:38,163 --> 00:07:39,883
- Oh. - What?

285
00:07:39,883 --> 00:07:40,716
What?

286
00:07:40,716 --> 00:07:41,549
- Oh, it smells. - What?

287
00:07:41,549 --> 00:07:42,648
- I didn't realize how bad it smelled.

288
00:07:42,648 --> 00:07:44,521
You just wafted some my way. - I know how bad it smells.

289
00:07:44,521 --> 00:07:45,469
I didn't do anything.

290
00:07:45,469 --> 00:07:46,796
You did this to me.

291
00:07:46,796 --> 00:07:48,259
Now we are on to round number four.

292
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:49,438
(bell dinging) Kimchi.

293
00:07:49,438 --> 00:07:51,366
- [Devan] What?

294
00:07:51,366 --> 00:07:53,149
- How do they fit all that kimchi in there?

295
00:07:53,149 --> 00:07:54,861
You can't even put the top back on.

296
00:07:54,861 --> 00:07:55,925
For those guys who don't know,

297
00:07:55,925 --> 00:07:56,758
kimchi is one of the

298
00:07:56,758 --> 00:08:00,262
nastiest ingredients I've ever used in a challenge.

299
00:08:00,262 --> 00:08:02,389
I first discovered it when I did a video with Glozell.

300
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:05,616
We did a smoothie challenge and it annihilated us.

301
00:08:05,616 --> 00:08:07,200
It's very important that I win this round.

302
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,598
Number one, so that I don't get that dumped on me.

303
00:08:08,598 --> 00:08:10,155
And number two if I don't win this round

304
00:08:10,155 --> 00:08:12,600
I lose the entire challenge right now.

305
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,270
- It is very important that I win this round.

306
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:16,701
- This is a make it or break it round right now.

307
00:08:16,701 --> 00:08:17,822
Put it on the hands.

308
00:08:17,822 --> 00:08:19,757
(spray can hissing) That's good.

309
00:08:19,757 --> 00:08:21,565
- Okay, ready? - Nope.

310
00:08:21,565 --> 00:08:22,946
- Three, two, one.

311
00:08:22,946 --> 00:08:25,613
(game clacking)

312
00:08:27,398 --> 00:08:28,573
No, no no no no!

313
00:08:28,573 --> 00:08:29,558
You're moving it.

314
00:08:29,558 --> 00:08:31,153
You're moving it. - Yeah.

315
00:08:31,153 --> 00:08:33,059
- You're moving it.

316
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:33,892
No.

317
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:39,123
- Yeah! (bell dinging)

318
00:08:39,123 --> 00:08:40,040
Here we go.

319
00:08:41,218 --> 00:08:42,098
- No.

320
00:08:42,098 --> 00:08:43,042
- Yes.

321
00:08:43,042 --> 00:08:44,389
I like this one.

322
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:45,803
- That's just way too much now.

323
00:08:45,803 --> 00:08:47,114
That's excessive.

324
00:08:47,114 --> 00:08:50,000
- First I'm gonna put a little bit of kimchi into this.

325
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,833
- [Devan] That's perfect.

326
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:51,729
Oh that's great, nice.

327
00:08:51,729 --> 00:08:53,176
Great, nicely done.

328
00:08:53,176 --> 00:08:54,284
- C'mon kimchi.

329
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:55,818
Work with me.

330
00:08:55,818 --> 00:08:56,651
Oh. - Oh.

331
00:08:58,435 --> 00:08:59,798
No. - Dude.

332
00:08:59,798 --> 00:09:02,946
I actually would take the sardines over this any day.

333
00:09:02,946 --> 00:09:04,505
- No, I'm glad I didn't get the sardines.

334
00:09:04,505 --> 00:09:05,598
The worst thing about this one

335
00:09:05,598 --> 00:09:07,543
is you know you're gonna get a piece of it in your mouth.

336
00:09:07,543 --> 00:09:08,971
- [Collins] All right, here we go.

337
00:09:08,971 --> 00:09:11,945
- Okay, I might actually throw up this one.

338
00:09:11,945 --> 00:09:13,404
- Mouth has to be open, remember.

339
00:09:13,404 --> 00:09:14,237
- Ah.

340
00:09:23,069 --> 00:09:24,370
- Are you okay?

341
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:25,295
- No, I'm not.

342
00:09:25,295 --> 00:09:26,471
I did get it all in my mouth.

343
00:09:26,471 --> 00:09:28,279
(spitting)

344
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:30,340
- What do you need?

345
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,956
I have some sardine juice. - No!

346
00:09:31,956 --> 00:09:32,789
Get that away.

347
00:09:32,789 --> 00:09:36,110
Any time I breathe I'm just getting kimchi everywhere.

348
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,296
- You guys, give me a thumbs up

349
00:09:37,296 --> 00:09:38,905
for the fact that we have taken a lot of,

350
00:09:38,905 --> 00:09:40,540
we have taken a beating in this video.

351
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,771
(bell dinging) Round number five.

352
00:09:41,771 --> 00:09:44,945
This is chopped clams in mystery liquid.

353
00:09:44,945 --> 00:09:47,574
One of 'em goes in the, ew.

354
00:09:47,574 --> 00:09:50,100
- Why you gotta do it like that?

355
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,234
- [Collins] It's just chunky.

356
00:09:51,234 --> 00:09:52,898
- [Devan] You're going to get some on me.

357
00:09:52,898 --> 00:09:54,120
Ew. - It smells like decay.

358
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,609
Right now it's a tie game.

359
00:09:55,609 --> 00:09:57,260
Devan.

360
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,093
Let's do this.

361
00:09:58,093 --> 00:10:00,285
All right, here we go.

362
00:10:00,285 --> 00:10:01,895
All right, Devan. - Yeah?

363
00:10:01,895 --> 00:10:03,786
- May the best man win.

364
00:10:03,786 --> 00:10:06,853
We start on the count of tree.

365
00:10:06,853 --> 00:10:08,257
Shrub.

366
00:10:08,257 --> 00:10:09,129
Bush.

367
00:10:09,129 --> 00:10:09,962
Tree.

368
00:10:09,962 --> 00:10:10,870
(game clacking)

369
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:11,703
- You started early.

370
00:10:11,703 --> 00:10:14,546
You're pushing it my way.

371
00:10:14,546 --> 00:10:15,379
- No.

372
00:10:15,379 --> 00:10:16,212
No!

373
00:10:20,122 --> 00:10:22,648
(bell dinging) - Yeah!

374
00:10:22,648 --> 00:10:23,481
Yes.

375
00:10:24,955 --> 00:10:26,538
- Oh no.

376
00:10:26,538 --> 00:10:28,685
It's just all liquid. - Bro here we go.

377
00:10:28,685 --> 00:10:29,758
Here we go.

378
00:10:29,758 --> 00:10:31,730
- Can you like, not do the liquid?

379
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:32,643
Maybe just the clams.

380
00:10:32,643 --> 00:10:33,678
Like just need the clams. - Oh, I'm doin'

381
00:10:33,678 --> 00:10:35,472
all of the liquid, bro.

382
00:10:35,472 --> 00:10:36,985
- [Collins] It's the mystery liquid of the clams.

383
00:10:36,985 --> 00:10:38,321
- [Devan] Oh, I gotta do this fast.

384
00:10:38,321 --> 00:10:40,200
This is goin' on your face right away.

385
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,460
All right, bro, you ready? - No.

386
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,539
- You gotta open-- - Just be careful with it.

387
00:10:43,539 --> 00:10:44,622
- Three, two.

388
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,430
He hit my hand.

389
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:01,812
- Oh, I got your hand?

390
00:11:01,812 --> 00:11:02,645
- Yes.

391
00:11:02,645 --> 00:11:03,986
- Can I get some paper towel?

392
00:11:03,986 --> 00:11:04,819
Ow.

393
00:11:04,819 --> 00:11:05,811
I'm not happy.

394
00:11:05,811 --> 00:11:07,177
And we're on to round number six.

395
00:11:07,177 --> 00:11:08,060
(bell dinging)

396
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:08,894
For this round we've gotten creative

397
00:11:08,894 --> 00:11:09,982
and taken all the things you would

398
00:11:09,982 --> 00:11:11,491
normally put on a hot dog,

399
00:11:11,491 --> 00:11:13,220
mustard, relish and pickles.

400
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,367
And we'll be putting them in a pie.

401
00:11:15,367 --> 00:11:18,295
This is the most important round of this entire challenge

402
00:11:18,295 --> 00:11:21,498
because if Devan wins it's game over and he gets to

403
00:11:21,498 --> 00:11:23,156
hit me in the face with this pie.

404
00:11:23,156 --> 00:11:25,663
And if I win this round then it goes to the tie-breaker

405
00:11:25,663 --> 00:11:27,457
for round number seven.

406
00:11:27,457 --> 00:11:29,403
And then who knows what's going to happen.

407
00:11:29,403 --> 00:11:30,735
(spray can hissing)

408
00:11:30,735 --> 00:11:33,063
We're going back to the one hand only rule.

409
00:11:33,063 --> 00:11:33,896
- What?

410
00:11:33,896 --> 00:11:35,562
- No more of this two-hands shenanigans, all right.

411
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:37,793
We're goin' back to the basics of the old school.

412
00:11:37,793 --> 00:11:39,265
- Okay, fine, all right. - One hand.

413
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:40,384
So place your head down.

414
00:11:40,384 --> 00:11:41,592
All right, here we go, three, two, one, go.

415
00:11:41,592 --> 00:11:43,415
(game clacking)

416
00:11:43,415 --> 00:11:44,248
- No. - Yes!

417
00:11:44,248 --> 00:11:45,248
- No. - Yes!

418
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:47,172
- No.

419
00:11:48,271 --> 00:11:49,104
- Yes.

420
00:11:51,749 --> 00:11:52,962
Wait, it didn't even get you.

421
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,803
- I know, you were pushing it that way.

422
00:11:54,803 --> 00:11:56,176
(bell dinging) Wait, no.

423
00:11:56,176 --> 00:11:57,288
- I got you. There we go.

424
00:11:57,288 --> 00:11:58,766
- This is actually better than what was about to be on me.

425
00:11:58,766 --> 00:11:59,919
- Here we go.

426
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:03,323
(spray can hissing)

427
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:04,707
- That looks really good.

428
00:12:04,707 --> 00:12:05,727
Why don't we just leave it at that

429
00:12:05,727 --> 00:12:07,728
and I'll just kinda - No.

430
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:08,954
- take these.

431
00:12:08,954 --> 00:12:09,953
No? You sure?

432
00:12:09,953 --> 00:12:12,283
- I'm pretty positive.

433
00:12:12,283 --> 00:12:13,116
- Oh.

434
00:12:13,116 --> 00:12:13,949
- Yeah, that looks pretty gross.

435
00:12:13,949 --> 00:12:15,517
All right, here we go, so we've gotta add some into

436
00:12:15,517 --> 00:12:17,556
the jackpot pie here in the middle.

437
00:12:17,556 --> 00:12:18,389
Oh. - Oh.

438
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,883
- This stuff disgusts me.

439
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,876
- [Devan] Oh, why?

440
00:12:26,876 --> 00:12:28,959
- I'm gonna try to do a long shot with the mustard.

441
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,354
Oops, I can get this, I can get this.

442
00:12:32,354 --> 00:12:33,187
(laughing)

443
00:12:33,187 --> 00:12:35,854
Then we've got the pickles last.

444
00:12:37,153 --> 00:12:38,332
Okay, the smell of it.

445
00:12:38,332 --> 00:12:41,360
- [Devan] There's like, no whipped cream in there, man.

446
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,813
- This one is making me sick just lookin' at it.

447
00:12:42,813 --> 00:12:43,811
Devan, you ready?

448
00:12:43,811 --> 00:12:45,132
- I'm ready, let's just get it over with.

449
00:12:45,132 --> 00:12:47,758
- This thing is just overflowing with goodness right here.

450
00:12:47,758 --> 00:12:49,343
All right, Devan, open your mouth.

451
00:12:49,343 --> 00:12:51,423
I actually apologize in advance for this one

452
00:12:51,423 --> 00:12:54,062
because this is disgusting.

453
00:12:54,062 --> 00:12:55,712
Ready?

454
00:12:55,712 --> 00:12:56,832
Three. Close your eyes.

455
00:12:56,832 --> 00:12:57,798
Make sure your eyes are closed.

456
00:12:57,798 --> 00:12:59,099
- I need to see it comin', man.

457
00:12:59,099 --> 00:13:00,812
- Two. Really?

458
00:13:00,812 --> 00:13:02,938
If this gets in your eyes it's game over.

459
00:13:02,938 --> 00:13:03,771
One.

460
00:13:05,024 --> 00:13:07,274
(spitting)

461
00:13:14,097 --> 00:13:16,136
Dude, don't do that.

462
00:13:16,136 --> 00:13:17,519
- I need a paper towel.

463
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:18,686
You know what?

464
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,733
It wasn't as bad as I expected it to be.

465
00:13:22,733 --> 00:13:24,043
- I'm not going to get you again, I promise.

466
00:13:24,043 --> 00:13:25,180
You can feel my hands, I have nothing in my hands.

467
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,696
- Just give me a paper towel.

468
00:13:26,696 --> 00:13:28,192
- Okay. (thump)

469
00:13:28,192 --> 00:13:29,368
- Now this is burning my eyes.

470
00:13:29,368 --> 00:13:31,472
Ow, it hurts the eyes.

471
00:13:31,472 --> 00:13:32,473
- Did you get it in your eyes?

472
00:13:32,473 --> 00:13:35,890
- Ow, I opened my eye for like, a second.

473
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,613
(whining)

474
00:13:38,613 --> 00:13:39,863
- Here. - Whoa.

475
00:13:42,153 --> 00:13:42,986
I'm good.

476
00:13:42,986 --> 00:13:44,608
- Dude, your eye is so bloodshot.

477
00:13:44,608 --> 00:13:45,790
- I'm good. (camera snap)

478
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:46,623
This is it.

479
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,790
(bell dinging) Round number seven.

480
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,411
The round you've all been waiting for.

481
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:50,560
The tie-breaker.

482
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,832
Whoever loses this is getting a pie

483
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:53,874
(slot machine bells)

484
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:55,562
with all the nastiest ingredients

485
00:13:55,562 --> 00:13:57,078
from this entire video

486
00:13:57,078 --> 00:13:59,172
in their face. - I'm so nervous.

487
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,833
- So much on the line right now.

488
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:03,375
Protocol on this one Devan is of the utmost importance.

489
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:04,792
Head on the game.

490
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,840
Hands on the button.

491
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,807
This is a free-style round.

492
00:14:07,807 --> 00:14:09,210
You can use two hands.

493
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:11,402
- [Both] Three, two, one.

494
00:14:11,402 --> 00:14:12,873
- You started early.

495
00:14:12,873 --> 00:14:14,052
Now you're pushing it out--

496
00:14:14,052 --> 00:14:15,816
(bell dinging) - No.

497
00:14:15,816 --> 00:14:17,368
Dude, no. - Yes.

498
00:14:17,368 --> 00:14:18,565
Yes. - Dude no.

499
00:14:18,565 --> 00:14:19,489
You distracted me.

500
00:14:19,489 --> 00:14:20,472
- Yes.

501
00:14:20,472 --> 00:14:21,586
- Dude, no.

502
00:14:21,586 --> 00:14:22,896
- Yes.

503
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:24,183
That was so fast.

504
00:14:24,183 --> 00:14:25,370
That was so fast.

505
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,198
- That was, how did I?

506
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:28,352
- Oh my gosh.

507
00:14:28,352 --> 00:14:30,033
- Like I just want to flip the table right now.

508
00:14:30,033 --> 00:14:32,652
I am so mad. - I am so happy.

509
00:14:32,652 --> 00:14:34,985
(sad music)

510
00:14:36,634 --> 00:14:37,815
A little happy dance. - All right guys.

511
00:14:37,815 --> 00:14:40,037
This whole pie is about to go in my face.

512
00:14:40,037 --> 00:14:41,191
Dude, I can't believe I lost.

513
00:14:41,191 --> 00:14:42,475
I am so upset right now.

514
00:14:42,475 --> 00:14:45,724
This whole nasty pie is about to go in my face.

515
00:14:45,724 --> 00:14:47,786
- All right, here we go. - Wait, wait.

516
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:49,858
There's one thing I wanted to let you guys know first.

517
00:14:49,858 --> 00:14:50,931
I want to make sure that we can

518
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,858
continue to expand this Keyper family.

519
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:54,388
Make sure the Keypers from around the world

520
00:14:54,388 --> 00:14:55,746
can enjoy these videos.

521
00:14:55,746 --> 00:14:57,465
So if you guys speak another language

522
00:14:57,465 --> 00:14:59,306
I would really, really appreciate it

523
00:14:59,306 --> 00:15:02,020
if you could translate these closed captions on the video.

524
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,182
There's a link all the way

525
00:15:03,182 --> 00:15:04,772
in the bottom of the description.

526
00:15:04,772 --> 00:15:05,945
So if you click on that.

527
00:15:05,945 --> 00:15:07,155
Translate the video into your language.

528
00:15:07,155 --> 00:15:08,897
You'll also get a credit on my video.

529
00:15:08,897 --> 00:15:10,264
Like, your name in my description

530
00:15:10,264 --> 00:15:12,202
giving you credit for translating and making sure

531
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:14,309
that Keypers all around the world can enjoy this.

532
00:15:14,309 --> 00:15:16,482
So we can get the Keyper family even bigger.

533
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:17,793
Show love to people around the world.

534
00:15:17,793 --> 00:15:19,094
- All right, here we go.

535
00:15:19,094 --> 00:15:20,313
- Are we really doin' this?

536
00:15:20,313 --> 00:15:21,146
- Yes we are.

537
00:15:21,146 --> 00:15:22,229
- We're doin' this for real.

538
00:15:22,229 --> 00:15:23,567
- Oh.

539
00:15:23,567 --> 00:15:24,817
- [Collins] No.

540
00:15:26,256 --> 00:15:28,388
Dude, do we-- - [Devan] Oh.

541
00:15:28,388 --> 00:15:31,069
- There's like a whole fish just like, living in it.

542
00:15:31,069 --> 00:15:32,245
- I don't wish this upon anyone.

543
00:15:32,245 --> 00:15:33,760
I feel bad, man.

544
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,051
Here we go. - Mouth open?

545
00:15:35,051 --> 00:15:37,192
- Yep, it's your rule. - Ah.

546
00:15:37,192 --> 00:15:38,025
Okay.

547
00:15:38,025 --> 00:15:39,162
No, I don't want to do it.

548
00:15:39,162 --> 00:15:39,995
Go.

549
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:44,000
(spitting)

550
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,833
- Oh.
