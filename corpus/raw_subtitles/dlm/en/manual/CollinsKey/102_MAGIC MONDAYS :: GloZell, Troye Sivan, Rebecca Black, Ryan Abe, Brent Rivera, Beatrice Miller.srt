00:00:02,371 --> 00:00:03,454
Magic Monday!

00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,364
- As most of you guys know, I just recently performed

4
00:00:06,364 --> 00:00:07,255
at Digifest.

5
00:00:07,255 --> 00:00:09,121
One of my favorite parts about the Digifest is I get to see

6
00:00:09,121 --> 00:00:11,217
all my friends from YouTube, I get to hang out with them

7
00:00:11,217 --> 00:00:12,966
and of course do magic for them.

8
00:00:12,966 --> 00:00:15,252
And if you see any of your favorite YouTubers in this video,

9
00:00:15,252 --> 00:00:16,643

10
00:00:16,643 --> 00:00:19,239
And without further ado, let's get to the magic.

11
00:00:19,239 --> 00:00:20,907
If you see a card you like just touch it.

12
00:00:20,907 --> 00:00:23,493
Just touch a card, any card you like.

13
00:00:23,493 --> 00:00:25,105
- [Man Offscreen] I like the number ten.

14
00:00:25,105 --> 00:00:26,885
- [Collins] All right, take it out.

15
00:00:26,885 --> 00:00:29,459
Just feel it, make sure it's like a regular card,

16
00:00:29,459 --> 00:00:30,605
it's not like tricky or anything.

17
00:00:30,605 --> 00:00:31,438
- It's a regular card.

18
00:00:31,438 --> 00:00:33,731
It's not tricky or anything. - [Girl] Are you sure?

19
00:00:33,731 --> 00:00:34,822
- [Boy] Troye Sivan

20
00:00:34,822 --> 00:00:35,836
(laughs)

21
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:36,669
All right check it out watch.

22
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:37,502
So we use this this one in the set.

23
00:00:37,502 --> 00:00:40,175
If you see your card just touch it. Touch it.

24
00:00:40,175 --> 00:00:41,008
Six of hearts, all right.

25
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:43,769
Take the six, show it to the camera.

26
00:00:43,769 --> 00:00:47,518
Here, put your hand on top of hers like this.

27
00:00:47,518 --> 00:00:49,055
No, her hand.

28
00:00:49,055 --> 00:00:50,415
Six of hearts.

29
00:00:50,415 --> 00:00:52,322
Put your hand on top of hers like this.

30
00:00:52,322 --> 00:00:53,155

Check it out, watch.

33
00:00:55,904 --> 00:00:59,098
When you use a king, that's where it gets crazy.

34
00:00:59,098 --> 00:01:01,025
Raise up one finger like this for me.

35
00:01:01,025 --> 00:01:02,336
Go like this.

36
00:01:02,336 --> 00:01:03,169
It's all good.

37
00:01:03,169 --> 00:01:04,072
Take and touch the king.

38
00:01:04,072 --> 00:01:05,655
Hold out your hand.

39
00:01:07,091 --> 00:01:08,239
Watch the king of hearts.

40
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:10,517

- This is where it gets crazy.

45
00:01:18,261 --> 00:01:21,016
I'm gonna have you turn over the king.

46
00:01:21,016 --> 00:01:24,489
(screaming and yelling)

47
00:01:24,489 --> 00:01:25,577
Turn it over, turn it over.

48
00:01:25,577 --> 00:01:26,410

49
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:28,389

- We'll use a six.

55
00:01:37,421 --> 00:01:38,254
- Do you have more tricks?

56
00:01:38,254 --> 00:01:39,087
- Yeah. Put your hand on top.

57
00:01:39,087 --> 00:01:40,139
- [Girl] This isn't the six anymore now.

58
00:01:40,139 --> 00:01:41,047
