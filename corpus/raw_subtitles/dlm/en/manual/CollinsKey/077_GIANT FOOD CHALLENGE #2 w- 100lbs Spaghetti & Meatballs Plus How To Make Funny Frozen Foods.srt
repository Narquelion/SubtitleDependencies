1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,330
- Flour drop!

2
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:02,163
Oh, man!

3
00:00:02,163 --> 00:00:03,201
Oh my gosh!

4
00:00:03,201 --> 00:00:04,034
- Oh wow.

5
00:00:04,034 --> 00:00:04,867
- Yo, we are (laughing)

6
00:00:04,867 --> 00:00:05,700
- [Collins] What did you do?

7
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:06,940
You challenged us to make the largest

8
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,450
bowl of pasta ever, so let's go!

9
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:10,756
Now it's time for me to make my ravioli noodles.

10
00:00:10,756 --> 00:00:11,900
- And I'm making my red sauce.

11
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,377
Dude, my cheese is so

12
00:00:13,377 --> 00:00:16,776
(cross talking)

13
00:00:16,776 --> 00:00:18,500
- Can you please get this off, Devan? This is mine.

14
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,653
- Oh, that's all yours?

15
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:20,486
I see how it is.

16
00:00:20,486 --> 00:00:22,890
- [Collins] It's for the dough of my ravioli noodles.

17
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,733
I got another brilliant idea right now. I got an egg,

18
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:25,800
I got a slingshot.

19
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,182
- Three, two, one! - Three, two, one!

20
00:00:28,182 --> 00:00:29,340
(laughing)

21
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,553
That didn't work! I am now Eggman.

22
00:00:31,553 --> 00:00:32,760
That doesn't feel good.

23
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,820
- [Devan] I am making a nice pasta sauce.

24
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,903
- [Collins] Holy cow, that smells so bad.

25
00:00:38,459 --> 00:00:39,292
- [Devan] Well, I got my bowl here.

26
00:00:39,292 --> 00:00:40,910
Now it's time to grab some of this heavy cream,

27
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:42,550
and since we're making giant pasta,

28
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:43,683
I need a giant whisk.

29
00:00:43,683 --> 00:00:45,661
- Bro, you put like eight whisks onto one drill.

30
00:00:45,661 --> 00:00:46,580
- Yes!

31
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:47,794
- Whoa!

32
00:00:47,794 --> 00:00:48,810
- Are you on double power though?

33
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:51,093
- I'm actually half trigger right now.

34
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:51,926
- [Collins] You know what Devan,

35
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:52,800
I don't think you're quite using it right.

36
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,633
There's actually very sound technique

37
00:00:53,633 --> 00:00:54,466
you can do with the whisk.

38
00:00:54,466 --> 00:00:55,623
Can I see it for a second?

39
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:57,733
I think you should handle this from now on.

40
00:00:57,733 --> 00:00:58,800
- Yes, I think so.

41
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,853
- Look at that organic, raw, fresh dough.

42
00:01:00,853 --> 00:01:03,353
I think I'm going back to my magician roots right now.

43
00:01:03,353 --> 00:01:05,130
- Oh, look at me! Look at me!

44
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:06,399
No! Why'd you do that?

45
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:07,560
- It's the impulse.

46
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,840
It came out of nowhere and I had to.

47
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,673
Brace yourself.

48
00:01:09,673 --> 00:01:10,891
Three, two, one!

49
00:01:10,891 --> 00:01:12,330
Oh! Here we go!

50
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:13,192
- Yeah!

51
00:01:13,192 --> 00:01:14,638
- This is how you mix the dough! Nailed it!

52
00:01:14,638 --> 00:01:17,030
(laughing)

53
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:19,319
Alright, here we go. Three, two, one!

54
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:20,780
(laughing)

55
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,080
I gotta say YEET! I thought this would

56
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,910
work a lot better than it actually did right now.

57
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:25,082
How long does this thing take?

58
00:01:25,082 --> 00:01:25,973
You're churning butter, Devan.

59
00:01:25,973 --> 00:01:27,163
This is what people used to do for a long time

60
00:01:27,163 --> 00:01:28,450
to make butter.

61
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:29,283
- I'm getting tired.

62
00:01:29,283 --> 00:01:30,637
- Oh!

63
00:01:30,637 --> 00:01:31,944
- For this next pasta sauce, I have to

64
00:01:31,944 --> 00:01:33,800
become a hibachi chef!

65
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,118
- Well, if you do that I'm going to become a

66
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:36,410
white water rafter.

67
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:37,910
- Every sauce needs tomatoes!

68
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:40,180
- Alright, while you do that time for me to

69
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,216
put this under here and

70
00:01:41,216 --> 00:01:44,228
(laughing)

71
00:01:44,228 --> 00:01:45,794
- Speed is of the essence.

72
00:01:45,794 --> 00:01:46,650
This is a hibachi chef.

73
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,353
- All right, (mumbles) here we go.

74
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:51,430
(laughing)

75
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,459
Aw man, I gotta, okay, yup, yup, yup

76
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:54,292
Just making all my

77
00:01:54,292 --> 00:01:55,274
(cross talking)

78
00:01:55,274 --> 00:01:57,908
- All right, now you're incorporating this into my dish.

79
00:01:57,908 --> 00:01:58,741
- Yeah, but I'm just doing my best over here.

80
00:01:58,741 --> 00:02:00,240
Oh! I got an idea. Bro, you know what you need

81
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,073
for yours? Bam! An egg!

82
00:02:01,073 --> 00:02:02,292
- No, no, no, no!

83
00:02:02,292 --> 00:02:03,125
No, I don't!

84
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:03,958
- Yes, you do! Scrambled eggs in it! Absolutely.

85
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:04,791
- No, I don't!

86
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:05,709
- And you just need some olive oil.

87
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:08,490
Gonna mix this together and smack that!

88
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:09,490
- Next up, some onions!

89
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:10,323
- Holy cow!

90
00:02:10,323 --> 00:02:12,140
I smacked the dough, and the dough smacked back.

91
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:12,973
- Oh, boy!

92
00:02:12,973 --> 00:02:13,847
- Devan, you're gonna make us cry!

93
00:02:13,847 --> 00:02:15,040
- Get ready to cry!

94
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,712
- Bro, I do not wanna be crying and hibachi grill!

95
00:02:16,712 --> 00:02:19,410
(mumbles) a brilliant way of mixing this.

96
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,160
This is the dough roller 4000.

97
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,300
Why is it called the 4000?

98
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,580
'cause we made 3,999 other ones

99
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,530
and they all sucked!

100
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,980
And this one's great, so here's how it works.

101
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,580
See you can roll out your forearms and roll out the dough.

102
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,590
Man, this is yours?

103
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,423
- [Devan] Yes!

104
00:02:31,423 --> 00:02:32,256
- I knew I found it somewhere in the house!

105
00:02:32,256 --> 00:02:34,560
I gotta say it's very good if you wanna get (yelling)

106
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,047
All right, dough is all rolled out!

107
00:02:37,047 --> 00:02:38,200
- [Devan] All right, I think I got a good base started

108
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,500
now I just gotta finish it up and I'm on to my next.

109
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,040
Oh, Collins the one thing a professional hibachi

110
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,043
chef always does is grabs one of these radishes

111
00:02:45,043 --> 00:02:46,323
puts it on here

112
00:02:46,323 --> 00:02:47,156
and you have to catch it in your mouth.

113
00:02:47,156 --> 00:02:48,590
- Oh, I got this. All right here we go.

114
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,810
- Three, two, one! - Three, two, one!

115
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:50,718
- Ow, in my face!

116
00:02:50,718 --> 00:02:52,061
- [Devan] Three, two, one!

117
00:02:52,061 --> 00:02:54,901
- Okay, I don't think you're a very good hibachi chef.

118
00:02:54,901 --> 00:02:55,734
- Yeah, last one.

119
00:02:55,734 --> 00:02:58,062
- Three, two, one! - Three, two, one!

120
00:02:58,062 --> 00:02:59,154
(triumphant music)

121
00:02:59,154 --> 00:02:59,987
- Yeah! First try!

122
00:02:59,987 --> 00:03:00,820
- First try!

123
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:01,653
I don't like this one.

124
00:03:01,653 --> 00:03:03,169
- That's why I used my bad radishes on him.

125
00:03:03,169 --> 00:03:04,730
- Sorry what was, what was that?

126
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,700
We got some veggies time to tear them up.

127
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,440
Here we go. Three, two, one! Here we go.

128
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,273
Oh my gosh.

129
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,056
I got these nails on, these acrylics.

130
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:13,947
Shred the lettuce.

131
00:03:13,947 --> 00:03:15,680
- I might dance like this.

132
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,150
- These things work amazing, bro!

133
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:17,983
This is incredible!

134
00:03:17,983 --> 00:03:19,259
- You know what I need? - Holy cow!

135
00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:20,480
- Five pound weight!

136
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,440
- [Collins] Wait, what?

137
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,273
- [Devan] Yes!

138
00:03:22,273 --> 00:03:23,480
- [Collins] You're using weights to smash your tomatoes?

139
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,313
- [Devan] Yes, I am!

140
00:03:24,313 --> 00:03:26,310
It seems like the most of your stuff is on the floor.

141
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,774
- Well Devan we'll be using this excuse me.

142
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:30,767
I gotta give these acrylic nails, five, ten thumbs up.

143
00:03:30,767 --> 00:03:32,640
- [Devan] For the last component of my red sauce

144
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,390
I am making a mashed potato cheese.

145
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:35,880
- While you do that I got the trumpet of

146
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,020
tragedy right here, Devan.

147
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,230
- What is that gonna be used for?

148
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:39,790
- It's gonna blow a whole in the space-time

149
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:40,623
continuum.

150
00:03:40,623 --> 00:03:41,563
- What?

151
00:03:41,563 --> 00:03:42,620
- Yeah, hop behind me Devan. - That sounds risky.

152
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,110
- Do not try this at home.

153
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:44,943
- Okay.

154
00:03:44,943 --> 00:03:45,776
- I suck at winking.

155
00:03:45,776 --> 00:03:47,835
- Three, two, one! - Three, two, one!

156
00:03:47,835 --> 00:03:50,134
(trumpet blowing) (explosion)

157
00:03:50,134 --> 00:03:51,895
- Oh, snap. We got dinosaurs.

158
00:03:51,895 --> 00:03:55,207
(cross talking)

159
00:03:55,207 --> 00:03:56,040
- Close it! Close it! Close it!

160
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:56,873
- Okay, there we go that was close.

161
00:03:56,873 --> 00:03:57,720
You're probably wondering how I'm gonna

162
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,723
be able to break open a pineapple.

163
00:03:58,723 --> 00:04:00,720
This is not a pineapple.

164
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,553
What is that?

165
00:04:01,553 --> 00:04:02,750
- [Devan] Now I'm putting some heavy cream into

166
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,213
here to make it all nice and whipped up.

167
00:04:04,213 --> 00:04:05,920
- This is like a soccer ball. There's no way

168
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,960
a soccer ball could whip up some cream, Devan.

169
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,646
- Oh it's, if you think this is a soccer ball,

170
00:04:09,646 --> 00:04:11,090
there is something wrong.

171
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:12,880
I'm actually pretty, hey, it's a little heavy.

172
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,810
- Hey, it's a soccer ball.

173
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:14,670
Are you all right? - My knee.

174
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,470
- [Collins] Time to bust this thing open. Here's what

175
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:17,680
we're gonna use. An anvil.

176
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,853
Three, two, one!

177
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:21,900
Let's just put it like this here.

178
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,790
Here we go. Three, two, one!

179
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,105
All right let's get an extra piece

180
00:04:25,105 --> 00:04:25,938
- Oh! All right, hold on one second I gotta open

181
00:04:25,938 --> 00:04:26,771
this thing up real quick.

182
00:04:26,771 --> 00:04:28,513
- All right, I'll totally wait for you. Psych!

183
00:04:29,598 --> 00:04:30,431
- I'm just gonna pop this thing open real quick.

184
00:04:30,431 --> 00:04:33,258
- [Collins] All right. - Just like this.

185
00:04:33,258 --> 00:04:35,130
- Oh! - Oh my god!

186
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:36,070
- [Collins] I don't understand how that's gonna

187
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,243
help you make a better pasta sauce, Devan.

188
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:39,247
- [Devan] Well it will once I add this Gruyere cheese.

189
00:04:39,247 --> 00:04:41,653
Look dude it's coming together man!

190
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,672
- Got a whole bunch of beets, you're gonna line

191
00:04:43,672 --> 00:04:44,666
these just like this. And then give me the perfect

192
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:46,299
flavoring for my ravioli.

193
00:04:46,299 --> 00:04:48,840
All right, well here we go. Got another cement block

194
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,840
over here. Here we go.

195
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,747
Do not try this at home!

196
00:04:50,747 --> 00:04:52,284
This is how you drop the beet.

197
00:04:52,284 --> 00:04:55,496
Three, two, one! - Three, two, one!

198
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:56,329
- Boom! - Oh my gosh.

199
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:57,686
- There we go. Yeah, that's how you do it.

200
00:04:57,686 --> 00:04:59,039
Bam, that's how you mash the beets.

201
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:01,270
- Okay. You broke the block.

202
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,595
- [Collins] All right there we go,

203
00:05:02,595 --> 00:05:03,580
so we got the beet all mashed up

204
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,820
and I think I got all the elements

205
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,370
I need to create my ravioli noodles.

206
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,940
So now it's time to put it all together.

207
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,041
Time to finish up the pieces of our pasta dish.

208
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:10,874
- Yes!

209
00:05:10,874 --> 00:05:12,060
- And for me, I got my ravioli dough right here.

210
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:12,963
Next up, I gotta roll it out. So here we go.

211
00:05:12,963 --> 00:05:15,410
Just continue like this. Oh, look at that guys.

212
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,110
I got a crater right here in the center of it.

213
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,980
It looks like it's not doing so hot right now.

214
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:19,813
So here we go.

215
00:05:19,813 --> 00:05:20,646
- [Devan] Look at that.

216
00:05:20,646 --> 00:05:21,479
- [Collins] Oh my god.

217
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:23,200
- [Devan] Yes, some nice melted cheese.

218
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,070
- All right as you're doing that I've got a whole

219
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,450
bunch of minced up lettuce here.

220
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,340
This... looks nasty.

221
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,839
Three, two, one! Let's see.

222
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:32,320
- Oh! - Oh!

223
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,510
I gotta say from an initial visual standpoint it

224
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,745
doesn't look the nicest, but I promise you it's

225
00:05:35,745 --> 00:05:37,503
gonna make my ravioli amazing.

226
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,540
- [Devan] You know what dude? I think this is going

227
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,130
way too slow. You know what I need?

228
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:42,090
The octowhisk.

229
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:43,840
- Oh, no. Hold on I gotta put my glasses on.

230
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,787
Oh, snap. Okay. Here we go. All right, glasses on.

231
00:05:44,787 --> 00:05:46,736
(cross talking)

232
00:05:46,736 --> 00:05:48,221
(yelling)

233
00:05:48,221 --> 00:05:50,168
- Three, two, one! - Three, two, one!

234
00:05:50,168 --> 00:05:51,434
(yelling)

235
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:52,949
- You broke the octowhisk!

236
00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:54,010
- It has too much torque.

237
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:56,430
- I think you should use the paddle whisk.

238
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,263
- No.

239
00:05:57,263 --> 00:05:59,460
- I think it would make a lot of fun.

240
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,870
- I think it would make a lot of mess.

241
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,070
- [Collins] Time to put the finishing touches

242
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:02,903
on our dishes.

243
00:06:02,903 --> 00:06:04,330
And these things are gonna look incredible.

244
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,560
We got the finished pasta pieces

245
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,220
and now it's time for the big reveal.

246
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,986
- And dude, your ravioli looks like little pillows.

247
00:06:08,986 --> 00:06:10,835
- Little pillows? These are huge pillows.

248
00:06:10,835 --> 00:06:12,430
Here's the big reveal? You ready?

249
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:15,005
Three, two, one! Ta-da! - Three, two, one! Ta-da!

250
00:06:15,005 --> 00:06:16,840
- [Collins] Look at these man! - [Devan] Wow!

251
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,650
- [Devan] I know your ravioli looks like pillows!

252
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:19,720
- [Collins] And that's a ton of sauce

253
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,165
because we're gonna make a ton of noodles, bro.

254
00:06:21,165 --> 00:06:23,120
So we're gonna mix these together and eat them

255
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,170
at the end of the video.

256
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:25,003
Apple freeze!

257
00:06:25,003 --> 00:06:26,948
(yelling)

258
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:38,650
- You are the worst firefighter of all time.

259
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:41,138
- That's why I'm not a firefighter. I am a YouTuber.

260
00:06:41,138 --> 00:06:44,364
You challenged us to make giant pasta so let's go!

261
00:06:44,364 --> 00:06:45,460
- I'm making a giant meatball,

262
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,599
and first I gotta grind up this frozen meat.

263
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:48,943
- [Collins] Holy cow! Do not try this at home!

264
00:06:48,943 --> 00:06:51,132
Now I'm gonna crush an apple. Oh my god!

265
00:06:51,132 --> 00:06:52,465
Three, two, one!

266
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:54,501
Holy cow, man.

267
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:55,543
That doesn't look too good.

268
00:06:55,543 --> 00:06:58,540
This is gonna be perfect for the filling of my ravioli.

269
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,410
- I'm obviously making massive, giant meatballs.

270
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:01,620
What are you doing?

271
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,226
- I'm summoning some thunder with my thunder sticks!

272
00:07:03,226 --> 00:07:04,059
- Really?

273
00:07:04,059 --> 00:07:04,892
(thunder clap)

274
00:07:04,892 --> 00:07:05,725
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

275
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:06,558
- Boom, and it's raining.

276
00:07:06,558 --> 00:07:07,391
- It's too much!

277
00:07:07,391 --> 00:07:08,224
- It's like the rain dance.

278
00:07:08,224 --> 00:07:09,057
- Too much rain.

279
00:07:09,057 --> 00:07:09,890
- It's sticks.

280
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:10,723
That's gonna be a huge meatball.

281
00:07:10,723 --> 00:07:11,556
- [Devan] Exactly.

282
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:12,610
- [Collins] Time to use these on my crab legs.

283
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:14,160
Yo! These crab legs popped them!

284
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,200
I didn't wanna have to do it, but we're gonna have to do it.

285
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,170
Three, two, one! - Three, two, one!

286
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,570
- Boom, boom! - Whoa, whoa!

287
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:25,403
And it went up my nose too.

288
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:26,910
Yup, there it is.

289
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,030
- [Collins] I gotta say for so much money

290
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,030
that's not a lot of meat right there.

291
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,790
That's all the meat you get for $80?

292
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:31,623
- Time to shred it!

293
00:07:31,623 --> 00:07:32,456
- Let's go!

294
00:07:32,456 --> 00:07:33,660
- Wait, what. Dude you copied me.

295
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,320
- No I didn't. Devan, all right. I did not copy you.

296
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,160
- Yeah, but dude this was my thing.

297
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,400
- [Collins] Mine is a little bit bent.

298
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,490
- [Devan] We'll be bros! Cheers.

299
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,587
- Three, two, one! - Three, two, one!

300
00:07:40,587 --> 00:07:41,455
- [Collins] Here we go, yes.

301
00:07:41,455 --> 00:07:43,540
See I'm the expert here I know how to do this, man.

302
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,977
- I don't think you're doing this right.

303
00:07:44,977 --> 00:07:46,340
- I'm doing this absolutely right.

304
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,816
- That's a lotta show, but not a lotta do.

305
00:07:48,816 --> 00:07:49,649
- Excuse me?

306
00:07:49,649 --> 00:07:51,460
Here's the thing man it's all about the chef skills.

307
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,711
You put them together and (mumbles)

308
00:07:53,711 --> 00:07:56,123
Yeah, boy. Look at all that.

309
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,790
- Yeah, boy!

310
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,213
- That looks actually way better than my meat.

311
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:01,800
Time to retire the Wolverine claws.

312
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,420
The only thing I could think of that's more effective

313
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,395
than Wolverine claws is a giant toothbrush.

314
00:08:04,395 --> 00:08:06,590
The thing is we're coming up on the New Year Devan,

315
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,436
so New Year, new me.

316
00:08:07,436 --> 00:08:09,979
Devan, do you brush your teeth 15 times a day?

317
00:08:09,979 --> 00:08:11,350
- I don't think that's healthy.

318
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,270
- Think that's why my gums are receding.

319
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,550
- No I think you're missing teeth, man.

320
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:15,710
- Oh, man. All right.

321
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,597
Next part of my filling, time to make a wok.

322
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:18,840
- Oh! - Oh!

323
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,027
- I gotta say wok's are pretty crazy, man.

324
00:08:21,027 --> 00:08:21,860
- Wow, yes. - Holy cow!

325
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,150
- I gotta take a "wok" on that one.

326
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,690
- Oh, yeah. Good, yeah.

327
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:25,523
Take a whole bunch of shrimp here,

328
00:08:25,523 --> 00:08:26,616
so here we go.

329
00:08:26,616 --> 00:08:27,449
- Oh! - Oh!

330
00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:28,531
- Man! All right, well there you go.

331
00:08:28,531 --> 00:08:30,469
I'm gonna drop the shrimp in three, two, one!

332
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:31,692
- Oh! - Stand back!

333
00:08:31,692 --> 00:08:33,395
- One, two, three, flip!

334
00:08:33,395 --> 00:08:35,177
- Wow, you lost it man!

335
00:08:35,177 --> 00:08:36,440
- [Collins] What is that dude?

336
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,900
- [Devan] I am making a scotch egg.

337
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,380
And for those of you who don't know what it is.

338
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,771
It's basically sausage and bread crumbs

339
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:42,061
wrapped around a hard-boiled egg.

340
00:08:42,061 --> 00:08:43,680
- All right, well I'm gonna add some mushrooms

341
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,513
into my wok over here.

342
00:08:44,513 --> 00:08:47,021
I'm also gonna add a whole bunch of onions.

343
00:08:47,021 --> 00:08:48,360
(coughing)

344
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,403
- What? What, what, what?

345
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:50,236
- The onions!

346
00:08:50,236 --> 00:08:51,250
- It hasn't reached me yet!

347
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,330
- Trying to get the onion smell out. Is it gone?

348
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:54,163
- No!

349
00:08:54,163 --> 00:08:55,170
- [Devan] Yes! I think I did it!

350
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:56,003
- [Collins] Holy cow!

351
00:08:56,003 --> 00:08:56,836
- [Devan] Look at that!

352
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:57,820
- Time to add some spices with a water balloon.

353
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,886
There we go! Bam.

354
00:08:58,886 --> 00:08:59,777
- What?

355
00:08:59,777 --> 00:09:00,740
- This is how you add spices, Devan.

356
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,573
You take the water balloon,

357
00:09:01,573 --> 00:09:02,406
and then bam, like that.

358
00:09:02,406 --> 00:09:03,239
- Wow!

359
00:09:03,239 --> 00:09:04,145
- Bam! Spices!

360
00:09:04,145 --> 00:09:04,978
- [Devan] Look at this!

361
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:05,811
- [Collins] Holy cow!

362
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:07,530
And to celebrate, another balloon!

363
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:08,750
Bam, there we go.

364
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,583
I gotta get a little piece out of there.

365
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:10,416
- What was that one?

366
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,020
- That was, um, I don't know.

367
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,793
- [Devan] You can see some of the yolk in there.

368
00:09:13,793 --> 00:09:14,626
Look at that!

369
00:09:14,626 --> 00:09:15,459
- [Collins] Ready, here we go.

370
00:09:15,459 --> 00:09:18,234
- Three, two, one. - Three, two, one.

371
00:09:18,234 --> 00:09:20,578
- I am on my tiptoes right now for no reason.

372
00:09:20,578 --> 00:09:22,156
How about this I added some bok choy.

373
00:09:22,156 --> 00:09:23,250
Bok choy?

374
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,083
- I don't know.

375
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:24,970
- Bok choy? I don't know.

376
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,660
Oh, here we go. A little bit of sauce.

377
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,010
- No, no! - Here we go.

378
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:29,535
It's not gonna pop.

379
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:30,777
- Oh! - Oh!

380
00:09:30,777 --> 00:09:31,610
- What was that one?

381
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:32,983
- Ew! It's vinegar!

382
00:09:32,983 --> 00:09:35,430
- [Devan] Got my bread crumbs in here, I got some eggs.

383
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:36,720
All right, now it's time to add the sausage.

384
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,373
- All right, as you add the sausage I got a bigger one.

385
00:09:38,373 --> 00:09:39,965
This got a whole bunch of seasoning in it.

386
00:09:39,965 --> 00:09:40,798
So here we go.

387
00:09:40,798 --> 00:09:42,120
So, three, two, one.

388
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,920
My heart was palpitating so quickly.

389
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,840
- You should see me over here I was like

390
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:48,523
- All right here we go.

391
00:09:48,523 --> 00:09:51,014
- Three, two, one. - Three, two, one.

392
00:09:51,014 --> 00:09:52,620
- Holy cow! I think I'm starting to get

393
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,453
psyched out by it.

394
00:09:53,453 --> 00:09:54,343
I think that it somehow, it's gotten to me.

395
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:55,512
Like psychologically.

396
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:58,067
- Three, two, one. - Three, two, one.

397
00:09:58,067 --> 00:10:00,246
(yelling)

398
00:10:00,246 --> 00:10:01,130
- You know what? Now I'm gonna have to cheat.

399
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:02,037
- Three, two, one. - Three, two, one.

400
00:10:02,037 --> 00:10:04,512
(yelling)

401
00:10:04,512 --> 00:10:05,570
- What, what, what?

402
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:07,520
- That stuff was stinky.

403
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,650
I think this is like all spice, but you know what?

404
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,870
That's the important thing in life.

405
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,270
It's season, season, season.

406
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,103
- [Devan] Now it's time to

407
00:10:13,103 --> 00:10:14,561
get my hard-boiled egg outta here.

408
00:10:14,561 --> 00:10:15,900
- [Collins] Oh, it's that easy!

409
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,698
- Now I'm gonna wrap this stuff around.

410
00:10:18,698 --> 00:10:19,600
- All right, I'm gonna open up a lemon right here

411
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,700
and I'm gonna squeeze it out.

412
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,543
Here we go, into my wok.

413
00:10:21,543 --> 00:10:22,860
Oh, look at that.

414
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,100
- [Devan] This is really tough, man.

415
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,750
My egg is super slippery.

416
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,583
But I think I did it.

417
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,390
I got it. I got it. Now I just need to cook it.

418
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,388
- Oh! Wait, that's gonna be one of your meatballs?

419
00:10:29,388 --> 00:10:31,463
- No, that's gonna be like the inside of my meatball.

420
00:10:31,463 --> 00:10:32,850
I gotta a brick of salt.

421
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:33,683
I gotta hammer.

422
00:10:33,683 --> 00:10:35,050
Now it's time to get some seasoning.

423
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:35,937
- Wait, you're just gonna smash that thing?

424
00:10:35,937 --> 00:10:37,279
- Oh, yes. You ready for this?

425
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,112
- Oh, man. All right, here we go.

426
00:10:38,112 --> 00:10:38,946
- Three, two... - Three, two...

427
00:10:38,946 --> 00:10:39,910
- Wait a minute. Three second like challenge.

428
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,050
We wanna see if you can like this video

429
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:42,206
in three seconds. You ready? Here we go.

430
00:10:42,206 --> 00:10:45,538
- Three, two, one! Done! - Three, two, one! Done!

431
00:10:45,538 --> 00:10:47,271
- Three, two, one! - Three, two, one!

432
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:49,040
(yelling)

433
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,620
- [Collins] This is salt?

434
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,640
- [Devan] Yes it is!

435
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,507
- Three, two, one! - Three, two, one!

436
00:10:57,763 --> 00:10:58,596
- I broke the board!

437
00:10:58,596 --> 00:10:59,429
- [Collins] Oh my god!

438
00:10:59,429 --> 00:11:02,780
That is a powerful smash! - [Devan] I broke the board!

439
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,613
- Salt!

440
00:11:03,613 --> 00:11:05,150
- Remember this is a giant meatball,

441
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,904
so I gotta coat this thing in double layer of meat.

442
00:11:06,904 --> 00:11:08,229
- [Collins] Well you've probably been wondering

443
00:11:08,229 --> 00:11:09,957
this whole time what it is I'm actually doing.

444
00:11:09,957 --> 00:11:11,458
The thing is I've been making the filling

445
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:12,972
for my ravioli. And now it's time to bring it all together.

446
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:14,796
Gonna dump this in here like this.

447
00:11:14,796 --> 00:11:15,629
Here we go.

448
00:11:15,629 --> 00:11:18,010
Gonna pick up this seasoned ball of butter right here.

449
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,150
Gotta melt it in like this.

450
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:21,090
Oh my gosh! There we go.

451
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,360
I gotta say you forming the meat.

452
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,060
That doesn't seem like it's coming together too well, man.

453
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,080
- [Devan] No, it is not.

454
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,366
- Gonna kinda pinch it. Oh! No!

455
00:11:26,366 --> 00:11:28,570
I dropped the whole thing of butter in there.

456
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,520
Next up it is now time to mix this all around.

457
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,950
I'm a genius. I've done it in a salad spinner.

458
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:33,790
So it's gonna be easy.

459
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:34,940
We're gonna unleash it first. Whoa!

460
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,340
- Whoa! - Whoa, my god.

461
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,580
Here we go. It's gonna spin around like this.

462
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,413
All right, now it's time to put

463
00:11:38,413 --> 00:11:40,890
the finishing touches on these and reveal the end product.

464
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:41,950
We've got the finished pasta pieces

465
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,340
and now it's time for the big reveal.

466
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,173
And yours!

467
00:11:44,173 --> 00:11:46,590
Words can't even describe what that looks like.

468
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:47,800
- And yours, looks great.

469
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,633
- Thank you.

470
00:11:48,633 --> 00:11:49,466

479
00:12:02,046 --> 00:12:03,879
- [Collins] That is so massive!

480
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:04,960
- [Devan] I know!

481
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,020
Don't let look deceive you.

482
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,020
I think mine's gonna be great.

483
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:07,870
- [Collins] We'll be putting them together

484
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,350
and eating them at the end of the video.

485
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,930
You challenged us to make giant pasta so let's go!

486
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,537
Now it's time to make the noodles and the white sauce.

487
00:12:13,537 --> 00:12:14,860
For the first part of my white sauce

488
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,524
time to freeze some coconuts in liquid nitrogen.

489
00:12:16,524 --> 00:12:18,906
- [Devan] Three, two, one! It's cracking.

490
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:20,494
- [Collins] A perfect hole in it!

491
00:12:20,494 --> 00:12:22,470
Coconut number one, here we go.

492
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:24,862
Gonna place it in my trough of vegetables.

493
00:12:24,862 --> 00:12:25,695
All right,

494
00:12:25,695 --> 00:12:27,470
so now I'm gonna move the liquid nitrogen off to the side.

495
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:28,490
What are you doing?

496
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:29,323
Are you all right?

497
00:12:29,323 --> 00:12:30,156
- Yes. I gotta separate the yolk

498
00:12:30,156 --> 00:12:31,282
from the other stuff.

499
00:12:31,282 --> 00:12:32,300
- The egg whites?

500
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,133
- Yes, that stuff.

501
00:12:33,133 --> 00:12:34,420
- Here is the big smash, ready?

502
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,911
Do not try this at home.

503
00:12:35,911 --> 00:12:36,744
Here we go.

504
00:12:36,744 --> 00:12:38,621
- Three, two, one! - Three, two, one!

505
00:12:38,621 --> 00:12:40,788
(yelling)

506
00:12:43,942 --> 00:12:44,979
- Yeah boy!

507
00:12:44,979 --> 00:12:45,812
- Wait where did it go?

508
00:12:45,812 --> 00:12:46,645
Don't you need that?

509
00:12:46,645 --> 00:12:47,478
- Oh.

510
00:12:47,478 --> 00:12:48,311
You know what? We got another right here.

511
00:12:48,311 --> 00:12:49,220
We'll just add to it all.

512
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,337
- Before you do that can you grab me an egg?

513
00:12:50,337 --> 00:12:51,963
Can you grab me that bowl?

514
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,320
- A bowling ball.

515
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,263
- Are you kidding me?

516
00:12:56,133 --> 00:12:56,966
- So here we go.

517
00:12:56,966 --> 00:12:58,050
- Three...

518
00:12:59,110 --> 00:12:59,943
- Excuse me.

519
00:12:59,943 --> 00:13:02,630
- Three, two, one! - Three, two, one!

520
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:03,910
(yelling)

521
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,184
- [Devan] That worked way better!

522
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:06,030
- [Collins] That worked so good! Look at this!

523
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:08,051
It like literally brought out the meat perfectly.

524
00:13:08,051 --> 00:13:09,463
- That was the best.

525
00:13:10,302 --> 00:13:11,135
- [Collins] Devan, what are you doing?

526
00:13:11,135 --> 00:13:12,890
- [Devan] I'm sorry this egg is uncontrollable.

527
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:13,960
- Control it.

528
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,867
This is gonna be the perfect base for my white sauce.

529
00:13:14,867 --> 00:13:17,120
- All right, I got all the pieces to my egg.

530
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,375
Now it's time to make the next part of my noodles.

531
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:19,343
I just gotta add some flour.

532
00:13:19,343 --> 00:13:21,700
- No! Wait a minute is that for your noodles?

533
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,533
- Yes this is for my noodles.

534
00:13:22,533 --> 00:13:23,725
- You are definitely making some giant noodles, Devan.

535
00:13:23,725 --> 00:13:25,730
I gotta say that is very impressive.

536
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:27,040
Well I've got this massage blaster right here.

537
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,620
It's time to tenderize some coconut meat.

538
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:31,380
Oh, yup. Here we go. Oh, man.

539
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,880
Devan, so how are the noodles going for you man?

540
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,713
- [Devan] Oh, not great.

541
00:13:33,713 --> 00:13:34,546
- All right. The meat is tenderized

542
00:13:34,546 --> 00:13:35,379
into a nice, fine powder.

543
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:36,420
This is gonna be the base of my white sauce.

544
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,470
- I got my pillow case here.

545
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,568
- And I got a whole bunch of dirt.

546
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:39,700
It's time to harvest some vegetables.

547
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,536
- Oh, wow, okay.

548
00:13:40,536 --> 00:13:42,290
- The thing is I've been planting

549
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:44,333
a whole bunch of dirt recently.

550
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:45,166
Veggies!

551
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,160
- I'm not sure that's how this works.

552
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,060
- You're questioning my dirt.

553
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,670
What are you doing with a pillow case and some, oh snap!

554
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:51,240
- Well normally what you do is put it in a small bag

555
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,493
but I got a pillow case.

556
00:13:56,032 --> 00:13:56,865
- Here we go. Well as you're doing this,

557
00:13:56,865 --> 00:13:59,150
here we go. We'll get a couple of my (mumbles)

558
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:01,326
That's how all chefs do it.

559
00:14:01,326 --> 00:14:02,210
- [Devan] I got a good pile of dough now

560
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:03,521
so now it's time to make the noodles.

561
00:14:03,521 --> 00:14:06,438
- [Collins] I'm gonna mince up all my veggies, here.

562
00:14:06,438 --> 00:14:07,360
That is how you mince, man.

563
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,320
I'm using the pizza technique.

564
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,267
- [Devan] Well that looks pretty intense.

565
00:14:09,267 --> 00:14:11,210
- I got some bananas, some liquid nitrogen,

566
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:12,309
a whole bunch of flavoring, and about to go in

567
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:13,290
my ravioli.

568
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:14,500
- I just gotta put this thing on.

569
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,360
- Oh, snap.

570
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,265
Yo! Look at that dude it's making the noodles!

571
00:14:17,265 --> 00:14:18,098
- [Devan] I know!

572
00:14:18,098 --> 00:14:18,931
- [Collins] Holy cow!

573
00:14:18,931 --> 00:14:19,764
- I gotta poke it through.

574
00:14:19,764 --> 00:14:20,597
- All right, here we go.

575
00:14:20,597 --> 00:14:21,660
I gotta take my banana and drop it in here.

576
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,493
Three, two, one.

577
00:14:22,493 --> 00:14:23,326
It's in!

578
00:14:23,326 --> 00:14:24,681
The banana is freezing in the liquid nitrogen.

579
00:14:24,681 --> 00:14:26,343
That is getting very long, Devan!

580
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:28,803
Oh, no! Oh my god!

581
00:14:28,803 --> 00:14:31,288
- [Devan] Dude this thing is so difficult.

582
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:32,744
Oh man. It fell off.

583
00:14:32,744 --> 00:14:34,100
Oh, they both broke!

584
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,821
- [Collins] My liquid nitrogen still is in full course

585
00:14:35,821 --> 00:14:36,654
right now.

586
00:14:36,654 --> 00:14:38,970
And this is gonna be perfect to add into the dough

587
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:40,170
of my ravioli noodles.

588
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,800
We've got all the frozen fruits and vegetables.

589
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,640
Now it's time to smash them.

590
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,002
We're gonna kick it off with a dragon fruit right now.

591
00:14:44,002 --> 00:14:45,810
This is gonna be perfect for the flavoring

592
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:46,710
of my ravioli.

593
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:48,189
I gotta say and for giant noodles,

594
00:14:48,189 --> 00:14:49,060
those are looking a little short.

595
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:49,893
You know?

596
00:14:49,893 --> 00:14:50,840
- Oh yeah. I think you're right.

597
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,820
I have an idea.

598
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:52,653
A pool noodle!

599
00:14:52,653 --> 00:14:53,486
- Hey, whoa!

600
00:14:53,486 --> 00:14:54,520
- Yes! And now for the dragon fruit!

601
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,105
- No! The dragon fruit is mine.

602
00:14:56,105 --> 00:14:59,850
Holy cow! - Oh geez!

603
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:00,730
- [Collins] Next up we've got the orange.

604
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:01,563
So here we go man.

605
00:15:01,563 --> 00:15:02,712
- Oh, yeah. Drop it on top.

606
00:15:02,712 --> 00:15:05,061
(yelling)

607
00:15:05,061 --> 00:15:06,730
Whoa, I got some noodles on here!

608
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:07,801
- I'm sorry. Here we go. Let's see.

609
00:15:07,801 --> 00:15:08,634
- I spent a long time on those.

610
00:15:08,634 --> 00:15:10,654
- Three, two, one! - Three, two, one!

611
00:15:10,654 --> 00:15:11,840
- [Devan] Save the noodles!

612
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,870
- Save the noodles!

613
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:13,720
Wait, so let me make this clear.

614
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,450
You're putting noodles in a pool noodle.

615
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:16,283
- Exactly.

616
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:17,370
- Okay. Now it's time for the tomato next.

617
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:18,390
So here we go. Tomato.

618
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,410
Versus bowling ball.

619
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:20,310
Who do you think is gonna win?

620
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,143
- [Devan] Tomato.

621
00:15:21,143 --> 00:15:21,976
- [Collins] Yeah. The tomato I agree.

622
00:15:21,976 --> 00:15:26,253
- Three, two, one! - Three, two, one!

623
00:15:26,253 --> 00:15:27,710
- [Collins] That was crazy!

624
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:29,060
Wait so what are you gonna do stuff it in there?

625
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,341
- [Devan] Yes but it dropped out of the bottom.

626
00:15:30,341 --> 00:15:31,267
- [Collins] Oh that's not good.

627
00:15:31,267 --> 00:15:32,650
- All right my noodle is all filled up.

628
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:33,737
Now it's time to cut it open.

629
00:15:33,737 --> 00:15:35,264
All right it is all cut open.

630
00:15:35,264 --> 00:15:36,900
And there's my noodle, man.

631
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,181
- Dude, that noodle is huge.

632
00:15:38,181 --> 00:15:39,290
- I know right.

633
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:41,130
- [Collins] I'm gonna dump out all the remaining

634
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:42,850
frozen pieces out over here.

635
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:44,080
So now it's time to smash.

636
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,913
Ready? Here we go.

637
00:15:44,913 --> 00:15:46,055
- Three, two, one! - Three, two, one!

638
00:15:46,055 --> 00:15:48,222
(yelling)

639
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,600
- [Devan] It's the eighth wonder of the world.

640
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,433
- [Collins] It is!

641
00:15:51,433 --> 00:15:52,490
It's a giant noodle!

642
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:53,614
It's coming out of this noodle right over here.

643
00:15:53,614 --> 00:15:54,501
- Yes!

644
00:15:54,501 --> 00:15:55,782
(mumbles)

645
00:15:55,782 --> 00:15:57,786
- There you go. That's how you get rid of the noodle.

646
00:15:57,786 --> 00:15:59,390
- [Devan] I think it just needs to be cleaned up

647
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,223
and it's all good.

648
00:16:00,223 --> 00:16:01,730
I'm just gonna have to collect all this flavor here,

649
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:02,640
but that's awesome.

650
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,840
Now it's time to for me to finish up my white sauce

651
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,673
right here.

652
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:06,560
- [Devan] I got my noodles here to finish up.

653
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,540
- Exactly. Got a huge spoon over here.

654
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,070
It's got a whole bunch of minced up

655
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:09,903
coconut right here.

656
00:16:09,903 --> 00:16:10,736
So here we go.

657
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:11,651
On the white sauce,

658
00:16:11,651 --> 00:16:12,520
just gonna add it in right now like there we go.

659
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,140
Now time to add in the veggies like that.

660
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:14,973
There we go.

661
00:16:14,973 --> 00:16:16,604
That's gonna add a whole bunch of nice flavor to mine.

662
00:16:16,604 --> 00:16:17,437
- Yes.

663
00:16:17,437 --> 00:16:18,970
- And last but not least, I have to be very sparing

664
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:20,060
with how much I add of this.

665
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,980
We've got over here all the different pieces

666
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,185
that we hit with the liquid nitrogen.

667
00:16:23,185 --> 00:16:24,173
So here we go.

668
00:16:24,173 --> 00:16:25,259
- You did a good job collecting all that.

669
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:26,092
- Thank you.

670
00:16:26,092 --> 00:16:27,290
- Now for me to put the finishing touches on my sauce.

671
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,175
It's very cold right now.

672
00:16:28,175 --> 00:16:29,008
- Yes.

673
00:16:29,008 --> 00:16:29,960
And then I have to make a bunch more noodles.

674
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,793
- Exactly. I think those are gonna look great

675
00:16:30,793 --> 00:16:32,420
when you finally finish them up.

676
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,450
We've got the finished pasta

677
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,003
and these things are crazy.

678
00:16:35,003 --> 00:16:37,830
- These are massive. I can barely reach across.

679
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:38,690
- Here's the big reveal.

680
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:41,660
- Three, two, one! Ta-da! - Three, two, one! Ta-da!

681
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,718
- [Collins] Oh my gosh!

682
00:16:42,718 --> 00:16:43,551
- [Devan] Wow! Look at them!

683
00:16:43,551 --> 00:16:45,363
- I cannot believe we actually pulled it off.

684
00:16:45,363 --> 00:16:46,816
No, no, no! Don't try that bro!

685
00:16:46,816 --> 00:16:47,649
- It is so heavy!

686
00:16:47,649 --> 00:16:48,508
- [Collins] This meatball is like 60 pounds!

687
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:49,610
- [Devan] I know right!

688
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:50,760
And those are like full

689
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:52,600
- Time to dig in.

690
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,472
So Devan, which delicious dish

691
00:16:53,472 --> 00:16:55,790
are we going to eat first?

692
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,700
- Oh man, I mean. Mine looks pretty crazy.

693
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,330
Yours has all these mystery ingredients on the inside.

694
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:01,890
- And it's like ravioli in a soup,

695
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:02,723
which is new.

696
00:17:02,723 --> 00:17:04,430
Let's do this a rock, paper, scissors for who will

697
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:05,263
eat first?

698
00:17:05,263 --> 00:17:06,096
- All right. I'm down.

699
00:17:06,096 --> 00:17:06,929
- Winner, that's the dish we try first.

700
00:17:06,929 --> 00:17:07,762
So here we go.

701
00:17:07,762 --> 00:17:08,795
- Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

702
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:09,628
- Yes!

703
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:10,770
- Oh, okay. Best two out of three.

704
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:12,170
- Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

705
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,003
- No!

706
00:17:13,003 --> 00:17:14,670
- Oh, okay! This is where it all comes down to.

707
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:15,503
- Here we go!

708
00:17:15,503 --> 00:17:16,400
- Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

709
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,869
- Oh, man! - Yes!

710
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:18,702
- [Collins] All right. I guess we eat yours first.

711
00:17:18,702 --> 00:17:21,490
So how do we even tackle this dish man?

712
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:23,960
- I think we to start we grab our giant fork and knife.

713
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,790
I think I'm just gonna cut off a big piece of this

714
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:26,623
side here like this.

715
00:17:26,623 --> 00:17:29,170
- Oh my god! That's more than a burger right there, Devan.

716
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:30,441
- We didn't really sharpen these very well.

717
00:17:30,441 --> 00:17:33,460
- Yeah, these are very dull. Very safe, large knives.

718
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,720
- So I got a piece of the meatball right here.

719
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,119
- [Collins] Oh, man. You're cutting the noodle next right?

720
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:38,373
(cross talking)

721
00:17:38,373 --> 00:17:40,260
- [Devan] Gonna grab some of these doughy noodles right here

722
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,220
- [Collins] That sinks right in.

723
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,420
Yeah those are. Did you even cook them?

724
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,320
- I tried.

725
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,490
They look thoroughly undercooked.

726
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:47,180
- As you can see guys I really focused

727
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,013
on this meatball.

728
00:17:48,013 --> 00:17:48,846
- I can tell.

729
00:17:48,846 --> 00:17:49,680
It's time for me to do something,

730
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,707
I wish I did a long time ago.

731
00:17:50,707 --> 00:17:51,573
- Okay.

732
00:17:52,782 --> 00:17:54,053
- It got in my eye!

733
00:17:54,053 --> 00:17:56,210
Your meatball is like a rock!

734
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,043
Here's what I'm gonna do.

735
00:17:57,043 --> 00:17:58,870
I'm gonna take this fork. Again, manners.

736
00:17:58,870 --> 00:17:59,703
I learned this from Kevin.

737
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:01,640
Just stick it like that and then just kinda like bam,

738
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,473
slicey, slicey, slicey.

739
00:18:02,473 --> 00:18:04,450
Gonna scoop off a little bit of noodle over here.

740
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:05,500
That's about all I want.

741
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,480
I know it's a giant noodle,

742
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,169
but I gotta say I'm not the most excited to try it.

743
00:18:08,169 --> 00:18:09,444
Time to see how these taste,

744
00:18:09,444 --> 00:18:10,875
and although these are extremely dull,

745
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:12,610
still do not try this at home!

746
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:13,443
- No!

747
00:18:13,443 --> 00:18:14,276
- Do not eat off of a knife!

748
00:18:14,276 --> 00:18:15,109
So let's see how this tastes.

749
00:18:15,109 --> 00:18:15,942
- Here we go.

750
00:18:15,942 --> 00:18:17,050
- Three, two, one! - Three, two, one!

751
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:18,114
- Hold on are you going for it? Oh, man.

752
00:18:18,114 --> 00:18:19,368
- Oh, god.

753
00:18:19,368 --> 00:18:21,535
(yelling)

754
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:28,214
- Those noodles! I can't even swallow it,

755
00:18:28,214 --> 00:18:29,047
it's so bad.

756
00:18:29,047 --> 00:18:30,680
(yelling)

757
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,663
(yelling)

758
00:18:32,663 --> 00:18:34,260
(yelling)

759
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,060
- Wow! That was real bad!

760
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,399
- Oh no! That was like,

761
00:18:37,399 --> 00:18:39,388
I don't think you seasoned it right.

762
00:18:39,388 --> 00:18:40,370
(laughing)

763
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,280
- With this terrible review on this one,

764
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,990
I don't know how good yours is gonna be.

765
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,263
- Yeah, I gotta say man.

766
00:18:45,263 --> 00:18:47,810
'Cause if you put some spices in yours,

767
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:49,421
I put some spices in mine.

768
00:18:49,421 --> 00:18:50,288
Paper towel attack!

769
00:18:50,288 --> 00:18:52,006
(cross talking)

770
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:53,350
- Would you mind cleaning? Here we go.

771
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,183
- Sure, yes.

772
00:18:54,183 --> 00:18:55,300
- Did you cook yours?

773
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,060
- If it's any consolation,

774
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,480
- Did you not cook yours too?

775
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,439
- Again, try cooking a three foot ravioli, bro.

776
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:02,131
- [Devan] It's not cooked just like mine.

777
00:19:02,131 --> 00:19:03,360
- [Collins] I'm trying my best, okay?

778
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,490
- You roasted me so hard for this.

779
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:06,323
- I'm sorry.

780
00:19:06,323 --> 00:19:09,933
Three, two, one. Oh! Look at that shrimp.

781
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,170
- Oh, man. I forgot all the stuff you put in there.

782
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:14,720
You know I was really excited to eat mine,

783
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,200
but I'm not excited to eat yours.

784
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,033
- [Collins] Well the thing is,

785
00:19:17,033 --> 00:19:17,870
I made different ones over here.

786
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:18,839
Slice open the top of this one, bam.

787
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:19,672
Here we go, bam!

788
00:19:19,672 --> 00:19:21,100
Look at that! Look at those!

789
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,890
Close that one back up.

790
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:23,850
- That's even worse.

791
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:24,754
- Not my best work.

792
00:19:24,754 --> 00:19:26,666
I'm just gonna kinda stab it over here like this.

793
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:27,499
Scoopity doop.

794
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,653
- Could you imagine if we all used this big of utensils?

795
00:19:29,653 --> 00:19:31,400
- I think we would get a lot more eating done.

796
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,790
I'm gonna try to, and this is so tough.

797
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:34,830
See, I helped you Devan,

798
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:35,870
but you haven't helped me once.

799
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:36,807
- You want me to use my hands?

800
00:19:36,807 --> 00:19:37,960
- You know what. Forget about the utensils.

801
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,793
We're going in with the hands,

802
00:19:38,793 --> 00:19:39,626
so here we go.

803
00:19:39,626 --> 00:19:40,459
Let's just take out this.

804
00:19:40,459 --> 00:19:41,292
Scoop up some of the inside.

805
00:19:41,292 --> 00:19:42,340
Bam, check it out.

806
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,420
I know it kinda defeats the purpose,

807
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,780
but mini ravioli!

808
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:45,613
Important to point this out,

809
00:19:45,613 --> 00:19:47,120
Devan and I will not be eating this all by ourselves.

810
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,700
We'll share this with our friends, family,

811
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,690
literally anyone.

812
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,110
We're gonna feed us for like a week right here.

813
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:53,380
Again, do not eat food off a giant utensil.

814
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,213
- Yes!

815
00:19:54,213 --> 00:19:55,046
- Do not recommend!

816
00:19:55,046 --> 00:19:55,879
- Three, two... - Three, two...

817
00:19:55,879 --> 00:19:57,120
- We just launched our brand new merch.

818
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,780
We got a whole bunch of crazy new designs,

819
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,613
we know you're gonna love.

00:19:59,613 --> 00:20:01,096

823
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:04,600
Let's see how it tastes!

824
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,020
- Three, two, one! - Three, two, one!

825
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:08,853
- Whoa!

826
00:20:08,853 --> 00:20:09,930
Whoa!

827
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:10,763
Whoa!

828
00:20:10,763 --> 00:20:11,596
Whoa!

829
00:20:11,596 --> 00:20:12,440
You can just comment down below,

830
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,990
and let us know which one looks better visually.

831
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:15,823
If you wanna see another video,

832
00:20:15,823 --> 00:20:16,656
click right over here.

833
00:20:16,656 --> 00:20:17,489
You got five seconds. Here we go.

834
00:20:17,489 --> 00:20:19,010
- Five, four, three, two, one. Done!

835
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:22,190
- Five, four, three, two, one. Done!

836
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:23,153
- Love you! - Bye!
