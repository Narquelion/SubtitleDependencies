1
00:00:00,579 --> 00:00:02,746
- ( Collins Key ) This is the largest melted gummy snake

2
00:00:02,746 --> 00:00:04,948
turned into sour slime.

3
00:00:04,948 --> 00:00:06,944
Three, two, one.

4
00:00:06,944 --> 00:00:09,031
You challenge me to melt giant gummy food

5
00:00:09,031 --> 00:00:12,375
into edible DIY candy slime that you can actually eat.

6
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:13,568
And so to do this, I got my friend Natalie

7
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:15,720
from Natlie's Outlet over here.

8
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,937
She is the queen when it comes to pranks,

9
00:00:17,937 --> 00:00:19,720
when it comes to DIY, so she's gonna be helping me out.

10
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,401
Today we are making three types of edible candy slime.

11
00:00:22,401 --> 00:00:24,582
The first one is out of a giant gummy worm.

12
00:00:24,582 --> 00:00:27,049
- The second one is watermelon flavored slime.

13
00:00:27,049 --> 00:00:29,332
- And the last one...

14
00:00:29,332 --> 00:00:30,165
- Oh.

15
00:00:30,165 --> 00:00:31,498
- And for the last one, we are melting

16
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:33,969
this eight foot long giant gummy snake

17
00:00:33,969 --> 00:00:37,469
into the sourest candy slime in the world.

18
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,994
And then we're gonna eat it.

19
00:00:39,994 --> 00:00:42,470
So right now, let's get started.

20
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:44,421
- How to does this work?

21
00:00:44,421 --> 00:00:45,748
- Make this super rare slime.

22
00:00:45,748 --> 00:00:47,561
First we need to melt the giant gummy worm.

23
00:00:47,561 --> 00:00:48,639
So let's do this.

24
00:00:48,639 --> 00:00:49,472
- Ready?

25
00:00:49,472 --> 00:00:50,471
- Yep.

26
00:00:50,471 --> 00:00:52,226
Okay, go towards the bottom.

27
00:00:52,226 --> 00:00:54,143
Oh, that looks so cool.

28
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,854
We're like burning it.

29
00:00:56,854 --> 00:00:57,695
Try to keep it like--

30
00:00:57,695 --> 00:00:58,528
uh-oh.

31
00:00:58,528 --> 00:01:00,945
It smells really good though.

32
00:01:04,556 --> 00:01:05,892
Alright, it's kinda...

33
00:01:05,892 --> 00:01:07,042
- It's catching fire.

34
00:01:07,042 --> 00:01:08,041
- Oh yeah, it is on fire.

35
00:01:08,041 --> 00:01:09,477
It's starting to drip though.

36
00:01:09,477 --> 00:01:11,070
It's starting to drip.

37
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,441
Come on, I believe in you.

38
00:01:12,441 --> 00:01:13,709
Oh my gosh, there we go.

39
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:14,944
That's a lot of it dripping out.

40
00:01:14,944 --> 00:01:17,910
Oh, that's a lot of smoke.

41
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:19,441
Oh, we don't have time for fire alarms.

42
00:01:19,441 --> 00:01:21,067
Okay, inside is getting kinda burned and kinda charred.

43
00:01:21,067 --> 00:01:22,560
If you do this at home be very careful.

44
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,074
Make you sure you have parental supervision.

45
00:01:24,074 --> 00:01:26,011
But it's kinda working a little bit.

46
00:01:26,011 --> 00:01:27,196
We are melting the gummy.

47
00:01:27,196 --> 00:01:28,368
I'm gonna try this really quick.

48
00:01:28,368 --> 00:01:31,785
Just kind of see how it's tasting so far.

49
00:01:33,337 --> 00:01:34,951
It taste delicious.

50
00:01:34,951 --> 00:01:35,784
- Hmm.

51
00:01:37,455 --> 00:01:38,718
- But this is not quite working how

52
00:01:38,718 --> 00:01:40,250
I thought it would, because look at this.

53
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:41,281
It's like a crusty mound right...

54
00:01:41,281 --> 00:01:42,406
Ow, that's hot.

55
00:01:42,406 --> 00:01:44,035
It's working, it's working!

56
00:01:44,035 --> 00:01:44,868
Yes, woohoo!

57
00:01:44,868 --> 00:01:45,722
- Woohoo!

58
00:01:45,722 --> 00:01:46,579
- This is so cool.

59
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:48,246
This literally reminds me of when we were doing

60
00:01:48,246 --> 00:01:49,915
that liquid metal fidget spinner.

61
00:01:49,915 --> 00:01:51,520
The way this thing is melting is crazy.

62
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,690
- It's bubbling.

63
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:54,425
So now that we've melted it, we're gonna add

64
00:01:54,425 --> 00:01:55,668
some cornstarch.

65
00:01:55,668 --> 00:01:57,931
Kind of eyeball it and then we're gonna make some slime.

66
00:01:57,931 --> 00:01:58,810
- Yeah!

67
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,930
I done this before one time where I accidentally used

68
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,503
my hands prematurely.

69
00:02:03,503 --> 00:02:04,336
Bad idea.

70
00:02:04,336 --> 00:02:05,490
Ah, it's on the back of my hand.

71
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:06,323
No, no, no, no, no.

72
00:02:06,323 --> 00:02:08,305
So we're gonna use a spoon for as long

73
00:02:08,305 --> 00:02:09,928
as we possibly can to make it.

74
00:02:09,928 --> 00:02:11,602
Oh my gosh.

75
00:02:11,602 --> 00:02:13,174
It's starting to get stringy, so I think we need

76
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:15,591
a little bit more cornstarch.

77
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:17,992
And then we're also gonna want to add a little bit

78
00:02:17,992 --> 00:02:19,065
of powdered sugar in.

79
00:02:19,065 --> 00:02:21,941
This is how we'll make it taste good.

80
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:23,541
Now we're gonna switch of stirring duties.

81
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:24,895
Not 'cause my arm got tired at all,

82
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:26,466
just because I think it would be great to share.

83
00:02:26,466 --> 00:02:27,665
Everyone gets to have a little bit

84
00:02:27,665 --> 00:02:29,193
of the experience.

85
00:02:29,193 --> 00:02:30,588
These videos are never clean.

86
00:02:30,588 --> 00:02:31,421
Ever.

87
00:02:32,864 --> 00:02:34,082
So ladies first.

88
00:02:34,082 --> 00:02:35,301
I'll let you...

89
00:02:35,301 --> 00:02:36,516
Let you do your thing.

90
00:02:36,516 --> 00:02:38,658
I'm a gentlemen when it comes to candy slime.

91
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,306
I've learned that to have good slime it shouldn't

92
00:02:40,306 --> 00:02:43,258
stick to your hands, but like it's stuck to my hands.

93
00:02:43,258 --> 00:02:45,353
It's like my hand is sneezing.

94
00:02:45,353 --> 00:02:47,206
Oh, there's still more slime left in the bowl

95
00:02:47,206 --> 00:02:48,440
that has not been mixed yet.

96
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,633
Whoa, this spoon is covered.

97
00:02:49,633 --> 00:02:51,438
Yo, I've got a new idea for a candy.

98
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:53,260
It's called the sugar spoon.

99
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,843
Stick it into powdered sugar...

100
00:02:59,635 --> 00:03:00,675
Like the cinnamon challenge.

101
00:03:00,675 --> 00:03:02,665
Quick, high five.

102
00:03:02,665 --> 00:03:03,498
Oh! - Oh!

103
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:05,688
- We're like stuck together now.

104
00:03:05,688 --> 00:03:06,710
You know what's missing right now?

105
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:07,543
- What?

106
00:03:07,543 --> 00:03:08,626
- Some nerds.

107
00:03:10,072 --> 00:03:11,574
Alright, so we're gonna add some nerds in

108
00:03:11,574 --> 00:03:12,741
what's going on.

109
00:03:12,741 --> 00:03:14,373
- Woo, party.

110
00:03:14,373 --> 00:03:15,441
- Yo this is so...

111
00:03:15,441 --> 00:03:16,617
(Collin sneezes)

112
00:03:16,617 --> 00:03:17,794
- Ew.

113
00:03:17,794 --> 00:03:19,727
- This looks so, so cool.

114
00:03:19,727 --> 00:03:20,969
'Cause now it's not only candy slime,

115
00:03:20,969 --> 00:03:22,316
but now there's like this little bumps here

116
00:03:22,316 --> 00:03:23,838
where you can see the nerds.

117
00:03:23,838 --> 00:03:24,851
- So you wanna taste it?

118
00:03:24,851 --> 00:03:26,300
- I think yeah, it's time to taste it.

119
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,971
But first, I have a challenge.

120
00:03:27,971 --> 00:03:30,385
I want to see can you subscribe to this channel,

121
00:03:30,385 --> 00:03:32,129
turn on the channel post notificatoins,

122
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:35,172
and give this video a thumbs up.

123
00:03:35,172 --> 00:03:37,508
Seven seconds, here we go.

124
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:40,841
Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.

125
00:03:43,308 --> 00:03:44,310
Done.

126
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,585
If you can do that, comment down below.

127
00:03:45,585 --> 00:03:46,862
Keyper Squad right now.

128
00:03:46,862 --> 00:03:48,367
So now for the taste test, you ready?

129
00:03:48,367 --> 00:03:49,934
I'm gonna go for a giant chomp.

130
00:03:49,934 --> 00:03:50,767
Here we go.

131
00:03:50,767 --> 00:03:51,957
Three,

132
00:03:51,957 --> 00:03:52,904
two,

133
00:03:52,904 --> 00:03:53,737
one.

134
00:03:55,821 --> 00:03:57,470
- Crunchy, slimy.

135
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,815
Every kid's dream.

136
00:03:58,815 --> 00:04:00,736
- It taste delicious.

137
00:04:00,736 --> 00:04:02,736
- Kinda tastes like gum.

138
00:04:03,621 --> 00:04:05,441
Wow, Collin.

139
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:06,743
- Let's melt this watermelon.

140
00:04:06,743 --> 00:04:07,931
- Woo! - Woo!

141
00:04:07,931 --> 00:04:09,440
That was very unsafe.

142
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,492
- Yeah, it was.

143
00:04:10,492 --> 00:04:14,390
It was a little too close to my face.

144
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,729
We're gonna be doing the hot knife

145
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:17,546
versus the gummy to melt it.

146
00:04:17,546 --> 00:04:18,738
We're gonna give this a shot right now.

147
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:19,571
So first.

148
00:04:19,571 --> 00:04:20,988
Let's heat it up.

149
00:04:21,836 --> 00:04:22,669
It's glowing.

150
00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:23,537
There we go.

151
00:04:23,537 --> 00:04:24,536
Three,

152
00:04:24,536 --> 00:04:25,542
two,

153
00:04:25,542 --> 00:04:26,444
one.

154
00:04:26,444 --> 00:04:28,444
Let's see if this works.

155
00:04:32,602 --> 00:04:34,003
- There goes.

156
00:04:34,003 --> 00:04:35,330
- Yo, it's working!

157
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:36,379
Oh no!

158
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:37,661
No, no, it's so smokey!

159
00:04:37,661 --> 00:04:38,949
Oh gosh no, what've we done?

160
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:41,949
It smells delicious, yet very toxic.

161
00:04:44,188 --> 00:04:46,106
It's working, there we go.

162
00:04:46,106 --> 00:04:48,309
It's almost like slicing off the gummy.

163
00:04:48,309 --> 00:04:49,335
Yes!

164
00:04:49,335 --> 00:04:50,466
Yes!

165
00:04:50,466 --> 00:04:51,573
Yes!

166
00:04:51,573 --> 00:04:53,427
I've got a new start this time guys, though.

167
00:04:53,427 --> 00:04:54,315
Watch out.

168
00:04:54,315 --> 00:04:55,616
Gonna slice it off.

169
00:04:55,616 --> 00:04:57,105
- [Natalie] You should slowly slice it off.

170
00:04:57,105 --> 00:05:01,188
- Yo, I wonder if you can slice right through it?

171
00:05:02,241 --> 00:05:03,860
Get so smokey so quick.

172
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,526
Yo, but it's actually melting it, guys.

173
00:05:05,526 --> 00:05:07,355
The way I'm holding this, this flamethrower

174
00:05:07,355 --> 00:05:08,954
in my face is not a good idea.

175
00:05:08,954 --> 00:05:10,190
I'm just like...

176
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,088
Well without smoking up the entire house,

177
00:05:11,088 --> 00:05:11,981
I think we're gonna pop this one again

178
00:05:11,981 --> 00:05:13,944
in the microwave, but this actually works.

179
00:05:13,944 --> 00:05:15,187
Like this actually melted.

180
00:05:15,187 --> 00:05:17,226
The hot knife was definitely a better strat

181
00:05:17,226 --> 00:05:18,828
than just the blowtorch.

182
00:05:18,828 --> 00:05:22,112
So right now, pop it in the microwave and let's go.

183
00:05:22,112 --> 00:05:24,379
What started off looking nice and pretty,

184
00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:25,652
and now it's just kinda...

185
00:05:25,652 --> 00:05:27,725
It looks like grease or like an oil.

186
00:05:27,725 --> 00:05:28,960
- Pour some in.

187
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,045
- Let's do it.

188
00:05:30,045 --> 00:05:30,878
- Slime.

189
00:05:30,878 --> 00:05:31,711
- Slime!

190
00:05:31,711 --> 00:05:32,544
Whip it, flip it, sauce boy!

191
00:05:32,544 --> 00:05:34,783
YO, this looks so nasty, fam.

192
00:05:34,783 --> 00:05:36,236
- Ew, it looks like hairball.

193
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:37,450
- I was going somewhere else with it.

194
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:39,352
I'm like this doesn't look like a watermelon.

195
00:05:39,352 --> 00:05:41,685
It looks like peanut butter.

196
00:05:43,034 --> 00:05:43,994
Go away.

197
00:05:43,994 --> 00:05:45,117
Alright, so now we're gonna pick it up

198
00:05:45,117 --> 00:05:46,108
with our hands and go...

199
00:05:46,108 --> 00:05:46,941
Oh my gosh!

200
00:05:46,941 --> 00:05:47,774
I got it on my shirt.

201
00:05:47,774 --> 00:05:48,725
Aw well, that's part of it.

202
00:05:48,725 --> 00:05:51,741
But now I have an edible candy shirt.

203
00:05:51,741 --> 00:05:53,209
- You've got skills.

204
00:05:53,209 --> 00:05:54,964
- Yo, this looks like a makeup that you would put on.

205
00:05:54,964 --> 00:05:56,110
Like it looks like a foundation.

206
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,234
- Wanna pour some on?

207
00:05:57,234 --> 00:05:58,110
- I'm good.

208
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:59,118
One more step to make sure

209
00:05:59,118 --> 00:06:00,556
it's the ultimate watermelon gummy.

210
00:06:00,556 --> 00:06:01,389
- What about me?

211
00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:02,222
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

212
00:06:02,222 --> 00:06:03,675
- Collin share.

213
00:06:03,675 --> 00:06:05,769
- I think mine are just kinda disengrating.

214
00:06:05,769 --> 00:06:07,279
Hers look really pretty, and then look

215
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:08,402
what happened to mine.

216
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:10,026
Mine just kinda splattered everywhere.

217
00:06:10,026 --> 00:06:11,524
It's definitely turning red now.

218
00:06:11,524 --> 00:06:12,830
So we didn't have the color before,

219
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,962
we definitely have the color now.

220
00:06:13,962 --> 00:06:15,035
Oh man.

221
00:06:15,035 --> 00:06:16,527
So let's see if this actually tastes

222
00:06:16,527 --> 00:06:18,043
like a real watermelon gummy.

223
00:06:18,043 --> 00:06:19,490
And if you wanna see me do a whole bunch

224
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:21,231

on our livestreams, 'cause we're gonna be doing

231
00:06:37,836 --> 00:06:39,415
literally whatever you want.

232
00:06:39,415 --> 00:06:40,756
So right now, you ready to try this?

233
00:06:40,756 --> 00:06:41,864
Here we go guys.

234
00:06:41,864 --> 00:06:43,064
Three,

235
00:06:43,064 --> 00:06:44,064
two,

236
00:06:44,064 --> 00:06:44,897
one.

237
00:06:46,337 --> 00:06:48,920
Ho, ho, it's stuck to my teeth.

238
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:51,650
Alright, so final verdict on this.

239
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:52,848
What are your thoughts?

240
00:06:52,848 --> 00:06:53,845
- I don't like it.

241
00:06:53,845 --> 00:06:54,865
- Yeah, I thought it was good at first,

242
00:06:54,865 --> 00:06:56,689
and then I started tasting all of the corn starch,

243
00:06:56,689 --> 00:06:58,757
and that really is terrible.

244
00:06:58,757 --> 00:07:00,398
So right now, we've been melting the eight foot

245
00:07:00,398 --> 00:07:04,228
gummy snake into the sour gummy slime in the world.

246
00:07:04,228 --> 00:07:05,061
Let's go.

247
00:07:06,147 --> 00:07:08,723
This is literally an eight foot gummy.

248
00:07:08,723 --> 00:07:09,556
Oh my gosh.

249
00:07:09,556 --> 00:07:10,390
It's so heavy.

250
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:12,341
It's like 20 something pounds.

251
00:07:12,341 --> 00:07:14,473
It's almost like it weighs 30 pounds.

252
00:07:14,473 --> 00:07:15,792
We're gonna make it sour.

253
00:07:15,792 --> 00:07:17,183
We also need the bucket.

254
00:07:17,183 --> 00:07:18,427
Alright, so I think I had it for like a second.

255
00:07:18,427 --> 00:07:19,980
Can we get the bucket?

256
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,045
You're gonna take the snake...

257
00:07:22,045 --> 00:07:22,974
Ow.

258
00:07:22,974 --> 00:07:23,978
It smacked me in the face.

259
00:07:23,978 --> 00:07:25,129
Where'd the eyeball go?

260
00:07:25,129 --> 00:07:26,342
Ah.

261
00:07:26,342 --> 00:07:27,493
I want the other eyeball though.

262
00:07:27,493 --> 00:07:29,076
I want to try this.

263
00:07:30,513 --> 00:07:31,346
- Good?

264
00:07:33,016 --> 00:07:34,227
It's so heavy.

265
00:07:34,227 --> 00:07:36,310
- Use your muscles.

266
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:40,028
(Collin and Natalie cheer)

267
00:07:40,028 --> 00:07:40,899
- This is so cool.

268
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:42,317
Fashion is my passion, but I'm gonna

269
00:07:42,317 --> 00:07:44,816
release my scarf now.

270
00:07:44,816 --> 00:07:45,827
Almost fell over.

271
00:07:45,827 --> 00:07:48,827
I wonder what it's gonna taste like.

272
00:07:49,814 --> 00:07:50,807
- It's lipstick.

273
00:07:50,807 --> 00:07:51,640
- What?

274
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:54,859
You wanna try to hold this thing?

275
00:07:54,859 --> 00:07:55,692
- Yeah.

276
00:07:56,707 --> 00:07:57,540
Oh.

277
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:05,259
- That was like choking me.

278
00:08:08,114 --> 00:08:09,937
Because this is eight feet long, we can't pop

279
00:08:09,937 --> 00:08:11,139
it in the microwave.

280
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:14,389
So now, we're making our own microwave.

281
00:08:34,637 --> 00:08:35,846
You know what, what I think we're gonna do

282
00:08:35,846 --> 00:08:37,525
is let's just chop it up, pop it in the microwave,

283
00:08:37,525 --> 00:08:38,733
and then put it back in here.

284
00:08:38,733 --> 00:08:42,483
Because there's no way we can melt this down.

285
00:08:44,545 --> 00:08:45,622
- Cheers! - Cheers!

286
00:08:45,622 --> 00:08:46,539
Oh my gosh.

287
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:49,116
There we go.

288
00:08:49,116 --> 00:08:50,584
Oh jeez, oh.

289
00:08:50,584 --> 00:08:51,417
Alright here we go.

290
00:08:51,417 --> 00:08:52,368
Time to make some...

291
00:08:52,368 --> 00:08:53,244
Yo, that was a powerful mix.

292
00:08:53,244 --> 00:08:54,620
- Stir, stir, stir, stir, stir.

293
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,391
- This one is going to need a lot more corn starch,

294
00:08:57,391 --> 00:09:01,524
because right now you can tell it's super, super gummy.

295
00:09:01,524 --> 00:09:02,921
Oh my gosh, she got it all over me.

296
00:09:02,921 --> 00:09:07,004
It looks like a bizarre alien substance for real.

297
00:09:08,194 --> 00:09:09,027
- Yay!

298
00:09:09,027 --> 00:09:10,338
Now we can do this.

299
00:09:10,338 --> 00:09:14,500
Now the corn starch won't get in my nose.

300
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,917
- Yo, this stuff looks crazy.

301
00:09:17,968 --> 00:09:18,968
You good?

302
00:09:18,968 --> 00:09:19,801
- Yeah.

303
00:09:19,801 --> 00:09:21,214
No, I really can't breathe.

304
00:09:21,214 --> 00:09:22,214
I can't see.

305
00:09:24,492 --> 00:09:26,135
- I think this slime is getting pretty good.

306
00:09:26,135 --> 00:09:27,681
And now we're gonna add the sour candy into

307
00:09:27,681 --> 00:09:29,086
what's going on.

308
00:09:29,086 --> 00:09:30,336
So right now...

309
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,542
What kind of a sound was that?

310
00:09:32,542 --> 00:09:34,447
We're doing a lightning round with the sour candy,

311
00:09:34,447 --> 00:09:36,753
and to kick it off, this is Cry Baby Soda.

312
00:09:36,753 --> 00:09:37,589
- I never had that.

313
00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:38,690
- I've never had it either.

314
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:42,988
So you have to bite off the top of it, apparently.

315
00:09:42,988 --> 00:09:44,116
It's like wax.

316
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:46,067
Cheers. - Cheers.

317
00:09:46,067 --> 00:09:47,138
Oops.

318
00:09:47,138 --> 00:09:48,638
I missed my mouth.

319
00:09:50,678 --> 00:09:51,511
Eww!

320
00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:54,209
That's sour.

321
00:09:56,793 --> 00:09:57,872
- Next up, toxic waste.

322
00:09:57,872 --> 00:09:58,705
Cheers!

323
00:10:07,327 --> 00:10:09,793
I've got some Warhead Chewie Cubes.

324
00:10:09,793 --> 00:10:11,007
We got like two left.

325
00:10:11,007 --> 00:10:14,111
- [Natalie] I never had these.

326
00:10:14,111 --> 00:10:16,988
- They're sour, but not too bad.

327
00:10:16,988 --> 00:10:18,070
- Yummy.

328
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:21,237
- Got this, I don't know what this is.

329
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,108
Oh, it's like a roll?

330
00:10:24,108 --> 00:10:25,441
Three, two, one.

331
00:10:29,884 --> 00:10:30,969
Oh no.

332
00:10:30,969 --> 00:10:31,968
- Are these like Pop Rocks?

333
00:10:31,968 --> 00:10:33,025
Yeah, sour power.

334
00:10:33,025 --> 00:10:33,858
Alright, here we go.

335
00:10:33,858 --> 00:10:37,363
Sprinkle a little bit of 'em in here, and then...

336
00:10:37,363 --> 00:10:38,196
Holy cow!

337
00:10:41,202 --> 00:10:43,095
Alright, I think we got some of this stuff here.

338
00:10:43,095 --> 00:10:44,047
I don't know what this is.

339
00:10:44,047 --> 00:10:46,380
Looks like some spray stuff.

340
00:10:50,235 --> 00:10:51,511
You like that?

341
00:10:51,511 --> 00:10:53,210
(Natalie screams)

342
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,440
- It's in my nose.

343
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,273
It burns.

344
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,671
- Yo guys, so we're adding some malic acid

345
00:10:58,671 --> 00:11:00,110
and she wants to try this stuff.

346
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,145
- I'll do it for the Keyper Squad.

347
00:11:01,145 --> 00:11:01,978
- You got it.

348
00:11:01,978 --> 00:11:03,169
Before you try it, guys we also filmed a video

349
00:11:03,169 --> 00:11:06,151
on her channel where we made slime.

350
00:11:06,151 --> 00:11:07,239
It's as crazy as it sounds.

351
00:11:07,239 --> 00:11:09,004
The link is down in the description below.

352
00:11:09,004 --> 00:11:10,748
So go check it out, go subscribe to her channel.

353
00:11:10,748 --> 00:11:14,680
Give her video a thumbs up and comment Keyper Squad.

354
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,513
Oh!

355
00:11:19,058 --> 00:11:21,260
Yo, I told you this stuff is crazy!

356
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,804
- My tongue, my tongue, my tongue.

357
00:11:22,804 --> 00:11:24,226
It's still going!

358
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:25,242
- It's still going?

359
00:11:25,242 --> 00:11:26,271
Alright, we're gonna do this.

360
00:11:26,271 --> 00:11:27,104
We're gonna do this quick.

361
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:27,937
We'll sprinkle the malic acid.

362
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:28,770
That's so much!

363
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:29,809
That sour stuff is so intense.

364
00:11:29,809 --> 00:11:30,748
It's so intense.

365
00:11:30,748 --> 00:11:32,181
There's so much malic acid everywhere.

366
00:11:32,181 --> 00:11:34,048
This is the largest melted gummy snake

367
00:11:34,048 --> 00:11:36,580
turned into sour slime.

368
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,073
We're about to eat it right now.

00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:40,217
But comment down below what's another giant

370
00:11:40,217 --> 00:11:43,498

00:11:43,498 --> 00:11:44,705

00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:45,538

381
00:12:01,524 --> 00:12:03,382
It's not a...

00:12:03,382 --> 00:12:04,215
