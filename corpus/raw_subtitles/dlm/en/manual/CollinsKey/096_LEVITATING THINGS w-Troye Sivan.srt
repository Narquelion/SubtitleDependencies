1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:00,923
- What's up guys?

2
00:00:00,923 --> 00:00:02,231
It's Collins Key, and you're watching

3
00:00:02,231 --> 00:00:04,487
- [All] Magic Monday!

4
00:00:04,487 --> 00:00:05,970
- What's Glozell doing to me?

5
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:07,360
(Glozell laughing maniacally)

6
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,193
- Hey. - Magic.

7
00:00:08,193 --> 00:00:10,362
- Ever since I posted the very first Magic Mondays,

8
00:00:10,362 --> 00:00:11,896
a bajillion of you have been asking

9
00:00:11,896 --> 00:00:14,128
if I can make stuff float and levitate.

10
00:00:14,128 --> 00:00:15,424
So in fact, you know, what better time to do that

11
00:00:15,424 --> 00:00:17,370
than at DIGIFest with all my YouTube friends

12
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:18,430
and freak 'em out.

13
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:20,073
If you guys recognize any of your favorite YouTubers

14
00:00:20,073 --> 00:00:22,352

15
00:00:22,352 --> 00:00:23,185
Enjoy.

16
00:00:23,185 --> 00:00:24,857
- [Jay Z] You now rockin' with the best.

17
00:00:24,857 --> 00:00:25,953
- You guys have a bill on you?

18
00:00:25,953 --> 00:00:27,000
- Yes, yes, yes.

19
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,369
Yes, yeah, I got it.

20
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:30,202
- All right.

21
00:00:30,202 --> 00:00:31,582
- Yeah, got some dollar bills.

22
00:00:31,582 --> 00:00:32,415
- Don't lose it.

23
00:00:32,415 --> 00:00:33,625
Don't you dare do anything to that bill.

24
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:34,599
(Collins drowned out by music)

25
00:00:34,599 --> 00:00:35,432
- This has to do with energy, all right?

26
00:00:35,432 --> 00:00:36,764
You guys know about static electricity, right?

27
00:00:36,764 --> 00:00:37,597
- Yes. - Yeah.

28
00:00:37,597 --> 00:00:38,430
- Check it out, watch.

29
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:39,530
Have you guys heard of static electricity before?

30
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:40,363
- Yes. - No.

31
00:00:40,363 --> 00:00:41,196
- He's stealing my money.

32
00:00:41,196 --> 00:00:42,079
- It's all energy, check it out.

33
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:42,912
- [Man] What is this, static electricity?

34
00:00:42,912 --> 00:00:44,077
- Yeah, static.

35
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:45,850
Take it, (mumbles)

36
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,458
you put some static electricity into the bill.

37
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:48,841
This is your bill, right?

38
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:49,674
- Yeah.

39
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:50,640
- Here you go, you just rub it on your pants like this.

40
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,288
You get static charge in the bill.

41
00:00:52,288 --> 00:00:54,647
You rub your fingers here like to actually charge.

42
00:00:54,647 --> 00:00:55,480
- Charges battery.

43
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,377
- Charges the bill, yeah.

44
00:00:56,377 --> 00:00:57,674
Oh yeah, it's kind of like charging a battery.

45
00:00:57,674 --> 00:01:01,606
- Put the static into the actual bill itself.

46
00:01:01,606 --> 00:01:02,506
Rebecca, take it, just rub it

47
00:01:02,506 --> 00:01:04,120
on your pant leg for a second.

48
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,992
- [Rebecca] Do it.

49
00:01:05,992 --> 00:01:07,933
- All right, now pass it back.

50
00:01:07,933 --> 00:01:08,766
Check it out.

51
00:01:08,766 --> 00:01:10,787
- It's real, y'all.

52
00:01:10,787 --> 00:01:11,637
- Watch me get the bill to actually

53
00:01:11,637 --> 00:01:13,705
stick to my finger like this. - What?

54
00:01:13,705 --> 00:01:15,074
- Look at this happen.

55
00:01:15,074 --> 00:01:16,024
Like I think it has a flow,

56
00:01:16,024 --> 00:01:18,424
but you actually have to stick to your finger like this.

57
00:01:18,424 --> 00:01:20,278
Take this bill and watch this.

58
00:01:20,278 --> 00:01:23,071
This is gonna be static electricity, you ready?

59
00:01:23,071 --> 00:01:23,978
- Whoa.

60
00:01:23,978 --> 00:01:25,815
- Sticks to my finger, right? - What?

61
00:01:25,815 --> 00:01:27,393
- It's this pure energy right now, watch.

62
00:01:27,393 --> 00:01:29,454
One, two, three.

63
00:01:29,454 --> 00:01:30,938
(people screaming)

64
00:01:30,938 --> 00:01:33,112
- [Woman] What the (bleep)!

65
00:01:33,112 --> 00:01:35,096
This just becomes pure, raw energy on the count

66
00:01:35,096 --> 00:01:37,415
of one, two, three.

67
00:01:37,415 --> 00:01:39,297
- Whoa! - What the (bleep)!

68
00:01:39,297 --> 00:01:40,631

69
00:01:40,631 --> 00:01:41,487
But this is where it becomes magic,

70
00:01:41,487 --> 00:01:42,938
just watch that bill.

71
00:01:42,938 --> 00:01:45,001
We get the energy just right, this is pure energy,

72
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:47,123
watch, into the bill.

73
00:01:47,123 --> 00:01:49,617
- Oh! - What the (bleep)!

74
00:01:49,617 --> 00:01:51,449
- Oh, Jesus!

75
00:01:51,449 --> 00:01:52,282
Oh, uh-uh.

76
00:01:53,243 --> 00:01:54,477
Oh.

77
00:01:54,477 --> 00:01:55,437
My nipples got hard.

78
00:01:55,437 --> 00:01:56,881
