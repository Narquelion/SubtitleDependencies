00:00:00,157 --> 00:00:00,990
- What's up guys.

2
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:03,355
It's Collins Key, and welcome to the Thursday Vlog.

3
00:00:03,355 --> 00:00:04,188
Now as you guys know,

4
00:00:04,188 --> 00:00:06,158
April Fools' Day is right around the corner

5
00:00:06,158 --> 00:00:08,097
and you guys don't really know this side of me,

6
00:00:08,097 --> 00:00:09,708
but on April Fools' Day,

7
00:00:09,708 --> 00:00:11,318
ever since I've been a little kid,

8
00:00:11,318 --> 00:00:13,179
I've always been crazy mischievous.

9
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:14,988
I've always planned these crazy elaborate pranks

10
00:00:14,988 --> 00:00:16,872
to pull on my parents on April Fools' Day,

11
00:00:16,872 --> 00:00:19,430
and it was the one day, no matter how crazy it was,

12
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:21,092
I never got in trouble.

13
00:00:21,092 --> 00:00:22,132
It was awesome.

14
00:00:22,132 --> 00:00:23,720
Today I'm actually doing something that magicians,

15
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:24,983
we're not really supposed to do.

16
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:26,847
I'm actually gonna reveal to you five

17
00:00:26,847 --> 00:00:29,154
of my top favorite April Fools' pranks.

18
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:30,764
These are easy things, fun things.

19
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:32,584
You can do this with stuff around your house.

20
00:00:32,584 --> 00:00:33,744
Don't have to go out and buy anything.

21
00:00:33,744 --> 00:00:34,577
Oh, and one more thing,

22
00:00:34,577 --> 00:00:36,285
I just saw a screening of DreamWorks Home,

23
00:00:36,285 --> 00:00:38,849
and it was such a cute movie. Oh my God.

24
00:00:38,849 --> 00:00:41,607
It actually comes out this Friday, March 27th, in theaters.

25
00:00:41,607 --> 00:00:42,982
So you guys gotta go check it out.

26
00:00:42,982 --> 00:00:43,940
But without further ado,

27
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,538
I'd say let's just jump into these top five crazy pranks.

28
00:00:46,538 --> 00:00:47,450
Let's do it.

29
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:48,567
Prank number one.

30
00:00:48,567 --> 00:00:50,644
I call this one the die in toilet prank.

31
00:00:50,644 --> 00:00:51,892
Now this one doesn't actually have to do

32
00:00:51,892 --> 00:00:54,067
with you dying in the toilet because that would suck.

33
00:00:54,067 --> 00:00:56,078
This one actually has to do with food coloring.

34
00:00:56,078 --> 00:00:57,489
Remove the lid from the toilet,

35
00:00:57,489 --> 00:00:59,249
and I found that Jell-O works the best for this.

36
00:00:59,249 --> 00:01:01,327
Open up a pack of Jell-O and pour it in.

37
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:03,926
This might not be enough, so open up another pack of Jell-O,

38
00:01:03,926 --> 00:01:05,609
pour that in, and one more pack,

39
00:01:05,609 --> 00:01:06,942
because you know, we're awesome.

40
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:08,800
Grab out a whisk and whisk away.

41
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,235
Whisk, whisk, whisk. It's pretty fun.

42
00:01:10,235 --> 00:01:12,839
Now you gotta put the lid back on and you're ready to go.

43
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:14,818
Now when someone goes to flush the toilet,

44
00:01:14,818 --> 00:01:17,258
they're gonna be in for quite a surprise.

45
00:01:17,258 --> 00:01:18,628
And let's just say the people coming in after,

46
00:01:18,628 --> 00:01:21,016
they might be, um, wondering what just happened.

47
00:01:21,016 --> 00:01:22,070
Prank number two.

48
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:24,055
This is a fun prank to do to someone in the shower.

49
00:01:24,055 --> 00:01:25,889
All you have to do is just take the bar of soap,

50
00:01:25,889 --> 00:01:28,672
and paint it completely with clear nail polish.

51
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:29,997
That way, when they go to use the soap,

52
00:01:29,997 --> 00:01:31,610
it will not sud up at all,

53
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:32,936
and basically they're going to be left

54
00:01:32,936 --> 00:01:34,570
with not being clean after a shower,

55
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:36,996
which kind of defeats the whole purpose of taking a shower.

56
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:38,077
Prank number three.

57
00:01:38,077 --> 00:01:39,569
This one I actually learned from Demi Lovato

58
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:40,774
when we were on tour together,

59
00:01:40,774 --> 00:01:43,193
and it's quickly become a personal favorite of mine.

60
00:01:43,193 --> 00:01:45,139
For this, you're gonna wanna grab your friend's phone,

61
00:01:45,139 --> 00:01:49,128
go into Settings, General, Keyboard, Shortcuts, New,

62
00:01:49,128 --> 00:01:51,141
and then type in a funny word like poop,

63
00:01:51,141 --> 00:01:52,314
or use your imagination,

64
00:01:52,314 --> 00:01:55,763
and then type in a word this person uses a lot, like hey.

65
00:01:55,763 --> 00:01:56,978
Hit Done.

66
00:01:56,978 --> 00:01:58,605
Now when this person types in hey,

67
00:01:58,605 --> 00:02:00,430
it will autocorrect to

68
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:03,920
(dramatic crescendo)

69
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,907
Prank number four.

70
00:02:04,907 --> 00:02:06,326
If you've got a friend or family member who

71
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:07,772
is always watching TV,

72
00:02:07,772 --> 00:02:09,584
this one will be perfect for them.

73
00:02:09,584 --> 00:02:12,036
Grab your remote and look for the LED on the front of it.

74
00:02:12,036 --> 00:02:14,706
Then, cut a piece of tape that's approximately the same size

75
00:02:14,706 --> 00:02:16,971
and cover the LED with the tape.

76
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:18,705
Whoever tries to use this remote is going

77
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:20,193
to be really frustrated to find out

78
00:02:20,193 --> 00:02:21,690
it doesn't work at all.

79
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,583
And, prank number five.

80
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:25,078
Now this one is great if you're lazy,

81
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:27,366
but you still wanna scare someone really bad.

82
00:02:27,366 --> 00:02:29,492
Leave a note warning someone they're getting pranked,

83
00:02:29,492 --> 00:02:32,292
and then don't do anything at all for the rest of the day.

84
00:02:32,292 --> 00:02:34,601
And those are my top five April Fools' Day pranks,

85
00:02:34,601 --> 00:02:36,399
and if you thought any of these pranks were clever

86
00:02:36,399 --> 00:02:37,974
let me know by liking this video

87
00:02:37,974 --> 00:02:39,201

88
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:41,479

89
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:43,973
And also, go add me on Snapchat because on April Fools' Day,

90
00:02:43,973 --> 00:02:46,506
my Snapchat story is going ham.

91

So go add me right now, @CollinsKey.

92
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,476

93
00:02:49,476 --> 00:02:51,753
I'll see you guys again next week. Bye.

94
00:02:51,753 --> 00:02:53,263
Woo! Yeah. Jump it up. Whoo-Hoo!
