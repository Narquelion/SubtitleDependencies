1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,833
- What's up, guys?

2
00:00:00,833 --> 00:00:03,036
It's Collins, and welcome to the Thursday vlog.

3
00:00:03,036 --> 00:00:04,931
So as you guys and tell, things are different today.

4
00:00:04,931 --> 00:00:09,209
I'm wearing a flannel, got this cool wall thing behind me,

5
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:10,252
and I'm going to be doing a challenge

6
00:00:10,252 --> 00:00:11,107
I've never done before.

7
00:00:11,107 --> 00:00:13,895
I'm going to be doing the What's In My Mouth challenge.

8
00:00:13,895 --> 00:00:15,768
How this works, I'm going to be taking a blindfold,

9
00:00:15,768 --> 00:00:17,031
putting it on so I can't see anything,

10
00:00:17,031 --> 00:00:19,371
and I'm going to be doing this Halloween-style,

11
00:00:19,371 --> 00:00:20,808
so my brother, he went out to the store,

12
00:00:20,808 --> 00:00:23,175
and he got a ton of random Halloween things,

13
00:00:23,175 --> 00:00:24,752
some nasty foods, I don't know what he got.

14
00:00:24,752 --> 00:00:25,611
He's going to be putting those things

15
00:00:25,611 --> 00:00:27,508
in my mouth as I'm blindfolded.

16
00:00:27,508 --> 00:00:29,671
I have to try to figure out what they are.

17
00:00:29,671 --> 00:00:30,737
Here's Devin.

18
00:00:30,737 --> 00:00:31,937
Hey!

19
00:00:31,937 --> 00:00:33,574
(laughter)

20
00:00:33,574 --> 00:00:34,945
Eyebrows are peeking out.

21
00:00:34,945 --> 00:00:35,778
Hello.

22
00:00:35,778 --> 00:00:36,888
I literally can't see anything.

23
00:00:36,888 --> 00:00:37,939
- It's Devin-approved.

24
00:00:37,939 --> 00:00:38,772
This.

25
00:00:42,281 --> 00:00:45,296
That's all you get. - Oh, what was that?

26
00:00:45,296 --> 00:00:48,118
That was like, cold and wet.

27
00:00:48,118 --> 00:00:50,939
- That would pretty much fit the...

28
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:53,031
- Ooh, it's a spoon!

29
00:00:53,031 --> 00:00:54,350
Ah, there's something on the spoon!

30
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,062
- Yes, there is something on the spoon.

31
00:00:56,062 --> 00:00:56,895
(retching)

32
00:00:56,895 --> 00:00:57,895
- Oh my god!

33
00:01:06,389 --> 00:01:07,821
Weird.

34
00:01:07,821 --> 00:01:10,184
- You can spit it out, it's pretty nasty.

35
00:01:10,184 --> 00:01:11,767
- It's like, scaly.

36
00:01:13,918 --> 00:01:15,056
Oh, god, okay, yeah.

37
00:01:15,056 --> 00:01:17,306
(spitting)

38
00:01:18,656 --> 00:01:21,009
- Oh, it smells terrible.

39
00:01:21,009 --> 00:01:22,762
- Dude, it tastes even worse.

40
00:01:22,762 --> 00:01:23,595
Fish, right? - Yeah.

41
00:01:23,595 --> 00:01:24,428
- Tuna?

42
00:01:24,428 --> 00:01:25,261
- No.

43
00:01:25,261 --> 00:01:26,246
- What is it?

44
00:01:26,246 --> 00:01:27,134
- Anchovies.

45
00:01:27,134 --> 00:01:28,506
- What are anchovies?

46
00:01:28,506 --> 00:01:31,119
- Alright, this is our next one.

47
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:32,818
Alright, here we go.

48
00:01:32,818 --> 00:01:33,651
- Do I put my head back?

49
00:01:33,651 --> 00:01:34,484
- No.

50
00:01:37,432 --> 00:01:38,265
- What?

51
00:01:39,579 --> 00:01:41,162
Wow, what the heck?

52
00:01:42,021 --> 00:01:43,344
What?

53
00:01:43,344 --> 00:01:45,094
Alright, do it again.

54
00:01:47,279 --> 00:01:48,395
- Promiscuous --

55
00:01:48,395 --> 00:01:49,728
- What the heck?

56
00:01:53,419 --> 00:01:54,312
It's like a finger.

57
00:01:54,312 --> 00:01:56,003
It's like a thumb.

58
00:01:56,003 --> 00:01:57,651
My nose!

59
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:58,967
It's some sort of plastic hand.

60
00:01:58,967 --> 00:02:01,431
- Yes, you finally got one right!

61
00:02:01,431 --> 00:02:02,812
Alright, this is our next one.

62
00:02:02,812 --> 00:02:04,109
- This isn't more fish or anything, right?

63
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:04,942
- No, no.

64
00:02:04,942 --> 00:02:07,183
- This one smells good.

65
00:02:07,183 --> 00:02:09,173
Oh, I like this one.

66
00:02:09,173 --> 00:02:10,814
Wow, this is tasty.

67
00:02:10,814 --> 00:02:12,479
It's like the polar opposite of what you just gave me.

68
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:13,531
Is this a Three Musketeers bar?

69
00:02:13,531 --> 00:02:15,415
- Yes, it is, yeah!

70
00:02:15,415 --> 00:02:16,791
Good job.

71
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:18,123
- It's really good.

72
00:02:18,123 --> 00:02:19,121
If you have like eight more of these,

73
00:02:19,121 --> 00:02:20,743
this challenge would be the best thing ever.

74
00:02:20,743 --> 00:02:22,757
- This is the next one.

75
00:02:22,757 --> 00:02:23,590
It's another candy,

76
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,295
so you're probably gonna get it right away.

77
00:02:25,295 --> 00:02:26,146
Open wide.

78
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:26,979
- Ahh.

79
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:30,733
Oh, that's not candy.

80
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:32,213
Oh my god!

81
00:02:32,213 --> 00:02:33,046
What...

82
00:02:33,046 --> 00:02:36,046
(coughing, gagging)

83
00:02:36,899 --> 00:02:38,489
- It smells so bad!

84
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:40,739
(spitting)

85
00:02:41,748 --> 00:02:42,680
- Is that cat food?

86
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,513
- No.

87
00:02:43,513 --> 00:02:45,930
- Alright, just a little bit.

88
00:02:47,884 --> 00:02:49,531
Okay.

89
00:02:49,531 --> 00:02:50,680
(spitting)

90
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,845
Is it any sort of animal food?

91
00:02:51,845 --> 00:02:52,678
- No.

92
00:02:52,678 --> 00:02:54,150
What are they made out of usually?

93
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,150
- Woodchips?

94
00:02:56,233 --> 00:02:57,066
- No, not woodchips.

95
00:02:57,066 --> 00:02:57,963
- Cat food's my final answer.

96
00:02:57,963 --> 00:02:58,796
What is it?

97
00:02:58,796 --> 00:03:00,424
- Okay, it's a liver pate.

98
00:03:00,424 --> 00:03:01,257
- A what?

99
00:03:01,257 --> 00:03:03,255
It sounds like a potty, like someone used the restroom,

100
00:03:03,255 --> 00:03:06,166
like a potty, 'cause it tastes just about as bad.

101
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:07,788
Straight up, one of the nastiest things

102
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:09,622
I've ever tasted in my entire life.

103
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:11,280
I am disgusted right now.

104
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,355
I'm striking out.

105
00:03:12,355 --> 00:03:14,162
- [Devin] You're one for four.

106
00:03:14,162 --> 00:03:16,304
- In my defense, these are really tough!

107
00:03:16,304 --> 00:03:17,760
- I don't know if you can see that.

108
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,593
I guess you can have --

109
00:03:18,593 --> 00:03:22,093
(toy squeaking, laughter)

110
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:24,729
- What was that?

111
00:03:24,729 --> 00:03:26,736
You scared me so bad!

112
00:03:26,736 --> 00:03:28,202
Eh?

113
00:03:28,202 --> 00:03:31,119
Ow, you're punching me in the face.

114
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:35,436
- You have to taste more than that!

115
00:03:36,456 --> 00:03:37,300
- Is that like a rat?

116
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,133
- Yes!

117
00:03:38,133 --> 00:03:40,060
- Woo hoo! - Yay, he got another one!

118
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:43,727
- You scared me so bad when you squeaked it.

119
00:03:48,834 --> 00:03:52,917
(increasingly suspenseful music)

120
00:03:56,918 --> 00:03:58,395
(screaming)

121
00:03:58,395 --> 00:03:59,387
What the heck?

122
00:03:59,387 --> 00:04:01,047
(laughter)

123
00:04:01,047 --> 00:04:02,000
Oh my god!

124
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,833
- I got him!

125
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:04,358
- Oh my god!

126
00:04:04,358 --> 00:04:06,107
- Here we have our next one.

127
00:04:06,107 --> 00:04:06,940
- My heart's beating.

128
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:07,932
First, a little squeaker toy,

129
00:04:07,932 --> 00:04:11,395
and then that was a full-on jump attack.

130
00:04:11,395 --> 00:04:12,338
(laughter)

131
00:04:12,338 --> 00:04:14,795
Oh my god, what the heck?

132
00:04:14,795 --> 00:04:15,628
What are you doing?

133
00:04:15,628 --> 00:04:17,961
It's like attacking my face.

134
00:04:20,002 --> 00:04:22,512
I don't like it, whatever it is.

135
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,442
Ew, what is that?

136
00:04:24,442 --> 00:04:26,796
Oh my god, it's, ahh!

137
00:04:26,796 --> 00:04:28,861
Sorry, it's just, is it a spider?

138
00:04:28,861 --> 00:04:29,694
- Yes!

139
00:04:29,694 --> 00:04:31,277
- Oh, god!

140
00:04:31,277 --> 00:04:33,627
I was like, if it's a, dude stop!

141
00:04:33,627 --> 00:04:34,460
No more!

142
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,641
- Don't worry, I'm not gonna do it again.

143
00:04:35,641 --> 00:04:37,504
- Okay, why was it so gummy?

144
00:04:37,504 --> 00:04:39,442
I was chomping on his booty, man!

145
00:04:39,442 --> 00:04:41,417
And that is it for the What's In My Mouth challenge.

146
