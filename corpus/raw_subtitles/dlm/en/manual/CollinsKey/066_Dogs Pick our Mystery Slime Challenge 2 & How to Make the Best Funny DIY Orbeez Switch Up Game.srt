1
00:00:00,462 --> 00:00:02,060
- Oh my gosh, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:02,893
- What was that?

3
00:00:02,893 --> 00:00:03,859
- Three, two, one.

4
00:00:03,859 --> 00:00:05,594
We've got puppies.

5
00:00:05,594 --> 00:00:07,191
And you challenged us to let puppies pick

6
00:00:07,191 --> 00:00:08,480
our slime ingredients.

7
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,544
My dog's name is Cuddles.

8
00:00:09,544 --> 00:00:10,377
- And mine is Puddles.

9
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:11,357
And he's off to the races.

10
00:00:11,357 --> 00:00:12,969
- And we also got a baby Corgi named Bubbles.

11
00:00:12,969 --> 00:00:15,358
So right now, are you ready to pick some slime ingredients?

12
00:00:15,358 --> 00:00:16,336
All right here we go, three,

13
00:00:16,336 --> 00:00:17,169
two, one. - Two, one.

14
00:00:17,169 --> 00:00:18,002
- Go for it buddy, go for it.

15
00:00:18,002 --> 00:00:18,835
Get some slime ingredients.

16
00:00:18,835 --> 00:00:19,710
- [Devan] Do it, oh they just wanna hang out.

17
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:20,577
Hanging out, trying.

18
00:00:20,577 --> 00:00:21,410
This is slime time.

19
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:22,263
- [Collins] Let's get some slime.

20
00:00:22,263 --> 00:00:23,251
Bro, okay, see.

21
00:00:23,251 --> 00:00:24,279
Your brother's like he's ready to go, bro.

22
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:25,112
Let's get some slime.

23
00:00:25,112 --> 00:00:26,158
- [Devan] High five, high five yeah.

24
00:00:26,158 --> 00:00:26,991
Yeah.

25
00:00:26,991 --> 00:00:28,109
- [Collins] Yes, we got contact solution.

26
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:29,099
All right we got clear glue, perfect.

27
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:31,086
And, wait, Orbeez, what?

28
00:00:31,086 --> 00:00:32,386
- [Devan] My first one's baking soda?

29
00:00:32,386 --> 00:00:33,310
Vinegar.

30
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:34,143
Yes, activator.

31
00:00:34,143 --> 00:00:35,586
- This is Bubbles, the corgi, and he's gonna be choosing

32
00:00:35,586 --> 00:00:37,130
our last slime ingredient.

33
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:37,963
You ready, bro?

34
00:00:37,963 --> 00:00:38,796
All right, here we go, three,

35
00:00:38,796 --> 00:00:39,629
two, one. - Two, one.

36
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:40,462
- Go for it bro.

37
00:00:40,462 --> 00:00:41,295
- [Devan] Go for it. - [Collins] Go get

38
00:00:41,295 --> 00:00:42,236
some more slime ingredients.

39
00:00:42,236 --> 00:00:43,069
- [Devan] Go, go, go, go, go.

40
00:00:43,069 --> 00:00:44,211
- [Collins] All right Bubbles, what have you got for me?

41
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:45,044
Oh, I'll take it, a blender.

42
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:45,877
- [Devan] All right Bubbles, red glue.

43
00:00:45,877 --> 00:00:46,710
- Now what's interesting, is that Puddles actually

44
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:47,741
chose baking soda and vinegar.

45
00:00:47,741 --> 00:00:48,574
- Oh yeah.

46
00:00:48,574 --> 00:00:49,417
- But you know what that creates right?

47
00:00:49,417 --> 00:00:50,926
Oh what is this, what is going on?

48
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:51,916
- What is it?

49
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:52,830
- Oh no, oh no, run.

50
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:54,326
(lava crackling)

51
00:00:54,326 --> 00:00:56,659
(screaming)

52
00:00:59,741 --> 00:01:00,957
- All right, well right now, let's sell, let's go.

53
00:01:00,957 --> 00:01:02,645
To kick things off we're gonna mash up

54
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:03,707
a whole bunch of Orbeez right now.

55
00:01:03,707 --> 00:01:04,540
Whoa. - What, dude?

56
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:05,470
- Yay. - You're already

57
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:06,303
getting them everywhere.

58
00:01:06,303 --> 00:01:07,136
- All right, wait, wait, wait.

59
00:01:07,136 --> 00:01:07,969
Hey.

60
00:01:07,969 --> 00:01:08,802
- Sorry, I just wanted to try (laughs).

61
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:09,635
- Let's relax, these are mine.

62
00:01:09,635 --> 00:01:10,468
And add them all here like this on the pan.

63
00:01:10,468 --> 00:01:11,301
Perfect, okay.

64
00:01:11,301 --> 00:01:12,134
We gotta figure out how to mash these up.

65
00:01:12,134 --> 00:01:12,967
So I think this here.

66
00:01:12,967 --> 00:01:14,066
(mashing loudly)

67
00:01:14,066 --> 00:01:15,333
- [Devan] Dude, oh, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude.

68
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:16,166
Keep 'em on your side.

69
00:01:16,166 --> 00:01:16,999
- I'm sorry, I was.

70
00:01:16,999 --> 00:01:17,839
- [Devan] I think I'm gonna add some vinegar here.

71
00:01:17,839 --> 00:01:19,204
Dude dude dude dude.

72
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,941
How am I supposed to make my slime?

73
00:01:20,941 --> 00:01:21,947
- Ho, ho, ho, ho, hew.

74
00:01:21,947 --> 00:01:22,780
This is game changing.

75
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:23,619
All right, here we go, add these in, oh, yes.

76
00:01:23,619 --> 00:01:24,565
- [Devan] Ew.

77
00:01:24,565 --> 00:01:27,120
- The thing is I don't wanna waste this stuff.

78
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,239
So, here we go.

79
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:29,474
We're just gonna put in a little package here like this.

80
00:01:29,474 --> 00:01:30,307
Rr, there we go.

81
00:01:30,307 --> 00:01:31,140
- What?

82
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:31,973
It's like a taco.

83
00:01:31,973 --> 00:01:33,295
- It's a little container.

84
00:01:33,295 --> 00:01:34,336
A little taco container for my Orbeez.

85
00:01:34,336 --> 00:01:35,291
- It's an Orbeez taco.

86
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:36,514
- We'll pop it right in here because I am going to be

87
00:01:36,514 --> 00:01:37,795
blending up my Orbeez.

88
00:01:37,795 --> 00:01:38,674
Perfect little funnel.

89
00:01:38,674 --> 00:01:40,253
There we go.

90
00:01:40,253 --> 00:01:41,228
Back to normal.

91
00:01:41,228 --> 00:01:42,384
It's to go for round number two, here we go.

92
00:01:42,384 --> 00:01:44,576
The uneven counter kind of made this

93
00:01:44,576 --> 00:01:45,700
a little bit more difficult.

94
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,533
I'm gonna use this thingy here.

95
00:01:46,533 --> 00:01:47,366
This thing's pretty cool.

96
00:01:47,366 --> 00:01:48,199
See, check out.

97
00:01:48,199 --> 00:01:49,320
(loud clanging)

98
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,153
(Devan laughing)

99
00:01:50,153 --> 00:01:50,996
I know I lost parts of it.

100
00:01:50,996 --> 00:01:52,895
Here we go, I'm just gonna scoop it in like this.

101
00:01:52,895 --> 00:01:53,906
Yo.

102
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:56,326
(mixer winding)

103
00:01:56,326 --> 00:01:57,159
- Really?

104
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,012
Wait.

105
00:01:58,012 --> 00:01:58,845
Oh.

106
00:01:59,706 --> 00:02:00,909
- I thought I lost it all.

107
00:02:00,909 --> 00:02:02,275
All right, we're gonna add this in right now.

108
00:02:02,275 --> 00:02:04,888
- So mine's looking pretty cool, but man I wish

109
00:02:04,888 --> 00:02:05,721
there was more colors.

110
00:02:05,721 --> 00:02:06,807
- I got you bro.

111
00:02:06,807 --> 00:02:07,963
I'm the master of colors.

112
00:02:07,963 --> 00:02:08,796
- [Devan] What?

113
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:09,629
Really?

114
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:10,462
- So here we go.

115
00:02:10,462 --> 00:02:11,295
- Ah, sweet.

116
00:02:11,295 --> 00:02:12,128
- We're just gonna use this little pot right over here.

117
00:02:12,128 --> 00:02:12,961
- [Devan] Okay.

118
00:02:12,961 --> 00:02:13,794
- Just grab yourself a neon vest like this.

119
00:02:13,794 --> 00:02:14,627
We're gonna have to ball it up a little bit.

120
00:02:14,627 --> 00:02:15,460
- Okay. - Three, two, one.

121
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,293
Ah.

122
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:19,089
- All that for just that?

123
00:02:19,089 --> 00:02:20,436
- Boom, check it out man.

124
00:02:20,436 --> 00:02:21,575
- Nice, All right.

125
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:22,860
- Enjoy your neon juice.

126
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:23,693
- Sweet man,

127
00:02:23,693 --> 00:02:24,551
thanks. - Yep.

128
00:02:24,551 --> 00:02:25,868
- Got some safety gloves on, and here we go.

129
00:02:25,868 --> 00:02:27,430
- [Collins] Oh. - [Devan] All right.

130
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,549
Dude is this stuff gonna glow in the dark?

131
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:29,476
- [Collins] Oh.

132
00:02:29,476 --> 00:02:31,718
Now we're just gonna add the rest in very carefully.

133
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:32,696
Oh.

134
00:02:32,696 --> 00:02:33,653
- [Devan] Oh.

135
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:34,486
- All right, time to blend it up.

136
00:02:34,486 --> 00:02:35,552
Here we go, three, two, one.

137
00:02:35,552 --> 00:02:36,967
(blender whirling)

138
00:02:36,967 --> 00:02:37,800
Perfect.

139
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,633
The blender really turns it all to mush man.

140
00:02:39,633 --> 00:02:40,919
Here we go so this.

141
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:42,414
Oh, hoo-hoo.

142
00:02:42,414 --> 00:02:43,434
In me eyeball.

143
00:02:43,434 --> 00:02:44,314
- That's not good.

144
00:02:44,314 --> 00:02:45,147
- No.

145
00:02:45,147 --> 00:02:46,153
All right, my Orbeez are all mixed up, and now it's time

146
00:02:46,153 --> 00:02:48,280
for the final step, which is to add the glue

147
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,404
and the contact solution.

148
00:02:49,404 --> 00:02:50,945
So first of all, for the glue, is we're gonna add

149
00:02:50,945 --> 00:02:52,037
about this much right there.

150
00:02:52,037 --> 00:02:53,077
All right, time to get my hands in

151
00:02:53,077 --> 00:02:54,356
and see how this stuff feels.

152
00:02:54,356 --> 00:02:55,273
Oh my gosh.

153
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,376
It feels like hair.

154
00:02:58,376 --> 00:03:00,131
- My slime has baking soda and vinegar.

155
00:03:00,131 --> 00:03:01,832
Does that mean it's gonna be a volcano slime?

156
00:03:01,832 --> 00:03:02,959
- I have got an idea. - Well, what is that?

157
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:03,949
- We're gonna summon my friend, his name

158
00:03:03,949 --> 00:03:06,828
is Tickle Me Tiki, and he is the expert on volcanoes.

159
00:03:06,828 --> 00:03:07,661
Here we go.

160
00:03:07,661 --> 00:03:08,494
- Okay.

161
00:03:08,494 --> 00:03:09,327
- Three, two, one.

162
00:03:09,327 --> 00:03:10,160
(ball exploding)

163
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:10,993
Oh, there he is.

164
00:03:10,993 --> 00:03:11,826
And he looks really angry.

165
00:03:11,826 --> 00:03:12,952
Well, no he's actually very happy,

166
00:03:12,952 --> 00:03:14,025
but he loves to be tickled.

167
00:03:14,025 --> 00:03:14,858
- Coochy-coochy-coo.

168
00:03:14,858 --> 00:03:15,691
Whoa. - Pretty cool, right?

169
00:03:15,691 --> 00:03:16,524
- Um, yeah.

170
00:03:16,524 --> 00:03:17,357
- Let's tickle him together, here we go.

171
00:03:17,357 --> 00:03:18,190
Ready, set, go.

172
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,257
(vocalizing)

173
00:03:19,257 --> 00:03:20,090
Woo-hoo.

174
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:20,977
Eventually it gets really crazy because we tickle him

175
00:03:20,977 --> 00:03:23,610
for three seconds, you'll love to see what happens next.

176
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:24,618
All right, here we go.

177
00:03:24,618 --> 00:03:26,601
Three, two, one.

178
00:03:26,601 --> 00:03:27,984
(tiki exploding)

179
00:03:27,984 --> 00:03:29,220
(Devan screaming)

180
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,053
Oh man, he's gone.

181
00:03:30,053 --> 00:03:31,917
- Dude, that was one temperamental tiki.

182
00:03:31,917 --> 00:03:33,348
- But here's the great thing Devan, he did say

183
00:03:33,348 --> 00:03:35,234
you have a 50% chance of it working.

184
00:03:35,234 --> 00:03:36,079
- Only 50%?

185
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:37,816
- All right, now it's time to add the contact solution in,

186
00:03:37,816 --> 00:03:39,552
and see if this Orbeez slime actually works,

187
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,209
but I really hope it does.

188
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:42,300
- Oh.

189
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,713
- Yo, it's starting to work.

190
00:03:43,713 --> 00:03:45,126
- [Devan] Not quite the most satisfying slime,

191
00:03:45,126 --> 00:03:45,959
but I made visually.

192
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,074
- You know what, Devan?

193
00:03:47,074 --> 00:03:48,163
I think it needs a little more Orbeez.

194
00:03:48,163 --> 00:03:49,463
So here we go, I'm just gonna place it down here.

195
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:50,296
- Wait.

196
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:51,129
- [Collins] It's gonna pick up some Orbeez

197
00:03:51,129 --> 00:03:52,083
off the counter just like this.

198
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:52,916
- Dude, you got it all over me dude.

199
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,405
- Ah man, I'm like picking up spoons.

200
00:03:54,405 --> 00:03:55,867
- All right, as you figure yours out, I'm gonna see

201
00:03:55,867 --> 00:03:57,814
if this vinegar can turn this into volcano slime.

202
00:03:57,814 --> 00:04:00,126
All right, here we go, three, two, one.

203
00:04:00,126 --> 00:04:01,282
- Wait, 5 Second Subscribe Challenge.

204
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,643
We wanna see if you can subscribe to this channel

205
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:05,815
and turn on the channel post notifications in five seconds.

206
00:04:05,815 --> 00:04:06,648
Are you ready?

207
00:04:06,648 --> 00:04:07,481
Here we go.

208
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:11,841
- [Both] Five, four, three, two, one, done.

209
00:04:11,841 --> 00:04:14,518
- If you can do that, comment on the Keyper Squad right now.

210
00:04:14,518 --> 00:04:16,015
- Three, two, one.

211
00:04:16,015 --> 00:04:16,960
(water pouring)

212
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,793
- [Devan] Oh.

213
00:04:17,793 --> 00:04:18,626
- Mix it, mix it, mix it, mix it, mix it, mix it, mix it,

214
00:04:18,626 --> 00:04:19,459
mix, mix, mix, mix, mix, mix, mix, mix.

215
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,292
- [Devan] I gotta mix, I gotta mix it, I gotta mix it.

216
00:04:20,292 --> 00:04:21,182
I'm mixing, I'm mixing, I'm mixing, I'm mixing.

217
00:04:21,182 --> 00:04:22,015
I think it's going, dude.

218
00:04:22,015 --> 00:04:22,848
- [Collins] Dude.

219
00:04:22,848 --> 00:04:23,709
Whoa, snap. - Whoa, dude.

220
00:04:23,709 --> 00:04:24,742
- When you get the comment down below,

221
00:04:24,742 --> 00:04:26,010
who's slime is cooler?

222
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:26,904
We're on to the next one.

223
00:04:26,904 --> 00:04:28,030
- Great job. - You guys did

224
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,196
a great job, you picked some great slime ingredients.

225
00:04:29,196 --> 00:04:30,139
- I know, great job. - And right now.

226
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:32,116
- Ah, he's so cute (laughs).

227
00:04:32,116 --> 00:04:33,239
- Oh, the kisses.

228
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:34,196
- I know.

229
00:04:34,196 --> 00:04:35,029
- The kisses.

230
00:04:35,029 --> 00:04:35,862
- It's the kiss attack.

231
00:04:35,862 --> 00:04:37,154
- (laughs) Are you gonna pick some more slime ingredients?

232
00:04:37,154 --> 00:04:38,116
My guys ready to go, he's ready.

233
00:04:38,116 --> 00:04:38,949
- I think mine's ready too.

234
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:39,782
- Go get some more slime ingredients.

235
00:04:39,782 --> 00:04:40,615
Go for it.

236
00:04:40,615 --> 00:04:42,374
All right, first up we got the clear glue.

237
00:04:42,374 --> 00:04:44,921
All right, now we got a little bit of contact solution.

238
00:04:44,921 --> 00:04:46,089
Nice, we got baking soda.

239
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:47,001
- [Devan] Wait, are you thirsty?

240
00:04:47,001 --> 00:04:48,432
Or, oh that's my ingredient.

241
00:04:48,432 --> 00:04:50,284
All right, glue or activator?

242
00:04:50,284 --> 00:04:51,386
Okay, activator.

243
00:04:51,386 --> 00:04:52,755
Puddles, ice cubes, really?

244
00:04:52,755 --> 00:04:54,183
- All right Bubbles, you're gonna

245
00:04:54,183 --> 00:04:55,093
be picking some new slime ingredients.

246
00:04:55,093 --> 00:04:55,926
You ready buddy?

247
00:04:55,926 --> 00:04:56,759
All right, here we go, three,

248
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:57,592
two, one. - Two one.

249
00:04:57,592 --> 00:04:58,425
- Go for it bro.

250
00:04:58,425 --> 00:04:59,258
No way dude, it's gallium.

251
00:04:59,258 --> 00:05:01,565
- [Devan] Come on Bubbles, yes, yellow glue.

252
00:05:01,565 --> 00:05:02,735
Oop, startled himself.

253
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:05,322
- Dude, I love gallium, and my favorite thing

254
00:05:05,322 --> 00:05:06,590
is what happens when you touch it.

255
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:07,449
Check this out, you ready?

256
00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:09,042
- Whoa, what?

257
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:11,562
That's never happened before, has it?

258
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:12,975
- [Collins] Ay.

259
00:05:12,975 --> 00:05:15,626
No, that has definitely not happened before.

260
00:05:15,626 --> 00:05:17,819
- [Collins] Bro, you should try it man, it's so much fun.

261
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:20,094
- All right, wait, nothing's happening.

262
00:05:20,094 --> 00:05:21,218
- [Collins] What do mean?

263
00:05:21,218 --> 00:05:22,063
A toaster? (laughs)

264
00:05:22,063 --> 00:05:22,896
What?

265
00:05:22,896 --> 00:05:23,729
That makes no sense.

266
00:05:23,729 --> 00:05:24,562
- [Devan] Why'd you turn me into a toaster?

267
00:05:24,562 --> 00:05:25,639
- I didn't do any.

268
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:26,472
It was the gallium.

269
00:05:26,472 --> 00:05:27,362
Bro, I did nothing.

270
00:05:27,362 --> 00:05:29,638
Maybe it's just like your true self being expressed here.

271
00:05:29,638 --> 00:05:30,471
I don't know.

272
00:05:30,471 --> 00:05:32,837
(gallium moving through Collins)

273
00:05:32,837 --> 00:05:34,203
- Whoa, I'm back.

274
00:05:34,203 --> 00:05:35,227
- Yes, it worked.

275
00:05:35,227 --> 00:05:36,060
- Yes. - Okay, great.

276
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:36,919
- I'm back bro, thank you.

277
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:38,025
- Dude, I'm so happy to have you back.

278
00:05:38,025 --> 00:05:38,935
Yeah, for sure.

279
00:05:38,935 --> 00:05:39,768
I was kind of scared you'd be a toaster forever.

280
00:05:39,768 --> 00:05:40,601
- Yeah, that was weird.

281
00:05:40,601 --> 00:05:41,568
All right, well right now, let's make some slime.

282
00:05:41,568 --> 00:05:42,683
I'm gonna pour this stuff into my hands.

283
00:05:42,683 --> 00:05:43,549
So, here's the crazy thing.

284
00:05:43,549 --> 00:05:44,721
Even though it looks like liquid.

285
00:05:44,721 --> 00:05:45,554
Oh my Gosh,

286
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:46,392
- What? - It is literally

287
00:05:46,392 --> 00:05:48,489
as heavy as metal in my hand right now.

288
00:05:48,489 --> 00:05:49,322
- [Devan] So cool.

289
00:05:49,322 --> 00:05:50,198
I'm gonna try to pour a ton of it out of my hand.

290
00:05:50,198 --> 00:05:51,031
Are you ready?

291
00:05:51,031 --> 00:05:52,455
- [Both] Whoa.

292
00:05:52,455 --> 00:05:53,288
- [Devan] Oh my gosh.

293
00:05:53,288 --> 00:05:54,305
- [Collins] Oh man.

294
00:05:54,305 --> 00:05:55,432
And look, it like leaves metallic residue bro.

295
00:05:55,432 --> 00:05:56,746
It's so cool.

296
00:05:56,746 --> 00:05:58,794
- [Devan] How are you gonna make slime with this, bro?

297
00:05:58,794 --> 00:06:00,192
- All right, so I'm gonna play with the gallium

298
00:06:00,192 --> 00:06:01,395
and add that to my slime.

299
00:06:01,395 --> 00:06:02,746
But the first step, I gotta add the glue.

300
00:06:02,746 --> 00:06:04,125
And unfortunately, I don't have my glue,

301
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:05,263
and I think that they actually took my glue.

302
00:06:05,263 --> 00:06:06,096
You guys are being sneaky.

303
00:06:06,096 --> 00:06:07,483
So I gotta tap into the secret glue reserve.

304
00:06:07,483 --> 00:06:08,742
So, let's ah see where they're at.

305
00:06:08,742 --> 00:06:09,879
Okay. - What?

306
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:12,434
- I think (tapping), nope, um.

307
00:06:12,434 --> 00:06:14,025
Dude, how do you know when you find it?

308
00:06:14,025 --> 00:06:15,715
- Oh, trust me, you'll know.

309
00:06:15,715 --> 00:06:16,733
(tapping)

310
00:06:16,733 --> 00:06:17,566
Nope.

311
00:06:17,566 --> 00:06:18,511
I know it's around here somewhere.

312
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:19,584
I think it's, oh, maybe, maybe.

313
00:06:19,584 --> 00:06:20,787
(knock)

314
00:06:20,787 --> 00:06:21,620
Did you hear that?

315
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,453
- Yeah.

316
00:06:22,453 --> 00:06:23,286
(knocking)

317
00:06:23,286 --> 00:06:24,119
- That's definitely it.

318
00:06:24,119 --> 00:06:24,952
Okay, here we go.

319
00:06:24,952 --> 00:06:25,785
- Okay.

320
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:26,618
- We got the faucet.

321
00:06:26,618 --> 00:06:27,451
- Okay, we're also gonna need the collecting bucket.

322
00:06:27,451 --> 00:06:28,284
- Okay.

323
00:06:28,284 --> 00:06:29,117
- And here we go, so we're just gonna have

324
00:06:29,117 --> 00:06:29,950
to get this perfect.

325
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:30,783
Here we go, three, two, one.

326
00:06:30,783 --> 00:06:31,688
Nailed it.

327
00:06:31,688 --> 00:06:32,521
That's perfect.

328
00:06:32,521 --> 00:06:33,354
Okay, here we go.

329
00:06:33,354 --> 00:06:34,187
And super easy, just snap. (snaps)

330
00:06:34,187 --> 00:06:35,020
(water boiling)

331
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:35,853
- Whoa.

332
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:36,686
- Yeah, I know right?

333
00:06:36,686 --> 00:06:37,519
Yo, it's almost overflowing.

334
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:38,352
- Ah, snap. - There we go.

335
00:06:38,352 --> 00:06:40,080
And to get it to fall down, we just have to give it

336
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,757
a little (claps), just like that.

337
00:06:41,757 --> 00:06:42,846
- Whoa. - Perfect.

338
00:06:42,846 --> 00:06:44,031
- All right. - Okay, so now,

339
00:06:44,031 --> 00:06:45,075
that's all, is add the glue in.

340
00:06:45,075 --> 00:06:45,918
- Okay - Here we go.

341
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:46,751
- [Devan] Oh, and that.

342
00:06:46,751 --> 00:06:47,584
- [Collins] Yep, there we go.

343
00:06:47,584 --> 00:06:50,745
I love the secret glue reserves, but you cannot tell anyone.

344
00:06:50,745 --> 00:06:51,783
Let's get some contact solution in this thing.

345
00:06:51,783 --> 00:06:53,560
- [Devan] I don't know how many I wanna add.

346
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,185
So I know I just add some water, but I think I need

347
00:06:55,185 --> 00:06:56,485
to get some more.

348
00:06:56,485 --> 00:06:57,669
- No, no, no. I got the water for you.

349
00:06:57,669 --> 00:06:58,825
Here we go. - What, really?

350
00:06:58,825 --> 00:07:00,044
- Here we go, three, two, one.

351
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:00,877
(water pouring)

352
00:07:00,877 --> 00:07:01,710
- What?

353
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:02,543
- Ah, perfect, done.

354
00:07:02,543 --> 00:07:03,376
- Whoa. - That's all you need.

355
00:07:03,376 --> 00:07:04,672
- I was just gonna grab it from the fridge,

356
00:07:04,672 --> 00:07:05,652
but that's awesome.

357
00:07:05,652 --> 00:07:07,388
- Why grab it from the fridge when you can get it fresh?

358
00:07:07,388 --> 00:07:08,591
(frame clanging)

359
00:07:08,591 --> 00:07:09,424
From a painting?

360
00:07:09,424 --> 00:07:10,345
- Yeah.

361
00:07:10,345 --> 00:07:11,399
- Mom's not gonna be happy.

362
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:12,538
Let me go ah (banging), put this back.

363
00:07:12,538 --> 00:07:13,371
And here's the twist.

364
00:07:13,371 --> 00:07:14,619
The puppies' are actually gonna be the ones who can mix

365
00:07:14,619 --> 00:07:17,186
up my slime, if they press the right buttons.

366
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,221
So right now, Cuddles, I need you to press

367
00:07:19,221 --> 00:07:21,204
the green button.

368
00:07:21,204 --> 00:07:22,504
Stay away from the red button, very bad.

369
00:07:22,504 --> 00:07:23,337
- Collins.

370
00:07:23,337 --> 00:07:24,170
- What?

371
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:25,365
- I think dogs are color blind.

372
00:07:25,365 --> 00:07:26,198
- You're kidding?

373
00:07:26,198 --> 00:07:27,841
You know what happens if he presses the red button, right?

374
00:07:27,841 --> 00:07:28,674
- No clue.

375
00:07:28,674 --> 00:07:29,824
- It activates a trap door.

376
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,182
- What? - Trapdoor.

377
00:07:31,182 --> 00:07:32,015
- Um, okay.

378
00:07:32,015 --> 00:07:33,700
- Yeah, we should not have had this thing installed.

379
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,558
Okay, so here we go.

380
00:07:34,558 --> 00:07:35,892
- Why are you leaving it to a dog?

381
00:07:35,892 --> 00:07:36,918
- Eye contact.

382
00:07:36,918 --> 00:07:38,088
Right here Cuddles, right here Cuddles.

383
00:07:38,088 --> 00:07:39,588
Green button, yay.

384
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,261
Red button, (grunts) no, no, no.

385
00:07:44,261 --> 00:07:46,136
Just focus on my thoughts, All right?

386
00:07:46,136 --> 00:07:46,969
(buzzer buzzing)

387
00:07:46,969 --> 00:07:47,802
(yells)

388
00:07:47,802 --> 00:07:48,635
- Collins, you okay?

389
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,490
My last step is to add my activator,

390
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:51,745
and I think I'm gonna measure it out

391
00:07:51,745 --> 00:07:52,894
like a responsible person.

392
00:07:52,894 --> 00:07:53,727
- The moment of truth.

393
00:07:53,727 --> 00:07:55,613
Time to add the gallium into my slime and see

394
00:07:55,613 --> 00:07:57,025
how it all mixes together.

395
00:07:57,025 --> 00:07:57,858
So, here we go.

396
00:07:57,858 --> 00:08:00,211
This is gonna be the craziest slime I've ever made.

397
00:08:00,211 --> 00:08:02,094
You ready, okay, here we go, three, two.

398
00:08:02,094 --> 00:08:02,927
- Yeah, oh. - Wait, first.

399
00:08:02,927 --> 00:08:03,760
3 Second Like Challenge.

400
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,686
We wanna see if you can like this video in three seconds.

401
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:06,713
You ready, here we go.

402
00:08:06,713 --> 00:08:08,713
- Three, two, one, done.

403
00:08:09,945 --> 00:08:10,778
- [Collins] Three.

404
00:08:10,778 --> 00:08:12,807
- [Both] Two, one, oh.

405
00:08:12,807 --> 00:08:13,640
- Dude.

406
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,679
- And now the moment of truth.

407
00:08:14,679 --> 00:08:16,012
Time to mix it together, you ready?

408
00:08:16,012 --> 00:08:16,845
Here we go.

409
00:08:16,845 --> 00:08:17,678
Gonna fold it over like this.

410
00:08:17,678 --> 00:08:18,511
- [Devan] Look, like it's already.

411
00:08:18,511 --> 00:08:19,344
- It's escaping out,

412
00:08:19,344 --> 00:08:20,177
it's escaping out. - Dude.

413
00:08:20,177 --> 00:08:21,010
- We gotta get in.

414
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:21,843
- Ah.

415
00:08:21,843 --> 00:08:22,676
- [Devan] Oh my God, it looks like a chunk of--

416
00:08:22,676 --> 00:08:23,509
(Collins and Devan screaming)

417
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:24,342
It's so heavy

418
00:08:24,342 --> 00:08:25,175
it broke through. - It broke it.

419
00:08:25,175 --> 00:08:26,008
- It's not gonna mix.

420
00:08:26,008 --> 00:08:26,841
- Here we go, so we're gonna

421
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:27,674
put it in here. - I think I won this.

422
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:28,507
- Gonna add this little bit in.

423
00:08:28,507 --> 00:08:29,340
- [Devan] It's so heavy.

424
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,469
- I'm gonna put the slime all around it.

425
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:31,398
So here we go, it's gonna be very careful.

426
00:08:31,398 --> 00:08:32,746
Here we go, look at it.

427
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:34,074
See, it's right here at the bottom.

428
00:08:34,074 --> 00:08:34,907
- Oh, it's so heavy.

429
00:08:34,907 --> 00:08:35,740
- What is going on?

430
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,573
- What?

431
00:08:36,573 --> 00:08:39,720
- What, there's no way? - Oh my gosh.

432
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,793
(Collins and Devan screaming)

433
00:08:40,793 --> 00:08:41,626
It's like a teardrop, bro.

434
00:08:41,626 --> 00:08:43,455
- That was so crazy.

435
00:08:43,455 --> 00:08:44,740
- What? - Oh my gosh.

436
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,221
- All right, it's time to mix it up.

437
00:08:46,221 --> 00:08:48,654
- [Collins] Oh, that look so cool.

438
00:08:48,654 --> 00:08:50,065
- [Devan] Dude, what?

439
00:08:50,065 --> 00:08:51,267
- Oh my gosh. - It's like honey.

440
00:08:51,267 --> 00:08:52,729
I love this this stuff.

441
00:08:52,729 --> 00:08:54,308
- All right, well you get to comment down below.

442
00:08:54,308 --> 00:08:55,835
Who made a coolest slime?

443
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:57,089
And right now, let's go back to the puppies

444
00:08:57,089 --> 00:08:58,176
and get our next slime ingredients.

445
00:08:58,176 --> 00:09:00,109
All right, you guys have been doing amazing so far.

446
00:09:00,109 --> 00:09:01,004
- Yes, whoa. - It's time for

447
00:09:01,004 --> 00:09:01,837
some new slime ingredients.

448
00:09:01,837 --> 00:09:02,670
Ready?

449
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:03,503
All right, here we go. - Go for it.

450
00:09:03,503 --> 00:09:04,371
Three, two one, go for it bro,

451
00:09:04,371 --> 00:09:05,520
get some more slime ingredients.

452
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,398
- [Devan] Mines already so ready.

453
00:09:06,398 --> 00:09:07,686
I can't even control him.

454
00:09:07,686 --> 00:09:08,519
- [Collins] We're kicking it off with some clear glue.

455
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:09,619
Nice cuddle, contact solution.

456
00:09:09,619 --> 00:09:10,952
Baking soda, okay.

457
00:09:10,952 --> 00:09:12,628
- [Devan] Ooh, shaving cream, yes.

458
00:09:12,628 --> 00:09:13,733
I love shaving cream.

459
00:09:13,733 --> 00:09:14,950
Sta-flo, awesome.

460
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:16,088
Yes, clear glue.

461
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:17,323
Ooh, look at his little toes.

462
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:18,362
- All right Bubbles, you ready to pick

463
00:09:18,362 --> 00:09:19,195
some more slime ingredients?

464
00:09:19,195 --> 00:09:20,028
You did a great job last time.

465
00:09:20,028 --> 00:09:20,861
You ready buddy.

466
00:09:20,861 --> 00:09:21,907
All right, here we go.

467
00:09:21,907 --> 00:09:22,868
Three, two, one.

468
00:09:22,868 --> 00:09:23,701
Go for it.

469
00:09:23,701 --> 00:09:24,534
Ooh, silly string.

470
00:09:24,534 --> 00:09:25,632
- [Devan] Oh wait, for slime?

471
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:26,780
All right Bubbles, what you got for me?

472
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:27,613
What, crayons?

473
00:09:27,613 --> 00:09:29,695
- I have never heard of silly string slime.

474
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:31,367
You what, let's give this a shot, let's see if this works.

475
00:09:31,367 --> 00:09:32,277
Uh!

476
00:09:32,277 --> 00:09:33,642
- Oh, oh snake. - Oh, oh, oh my gosh.

477
00:09:33,642 --> 00:09:34,633
(Devan screaming)

478
00:09:34,633 --> 00:09:35,511
- Is it gone?

479
00:09:35,511 --> 00:09:36,684
(Collins laughing)

480
00:09:36,684 --> 00:09:37,517
Is it gone?

481
00:09:37,517 --> 00:09:38,860
Dude, it's not even a real snake.

482
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:39,693
- Fleet.

483
00:09:39,693 --> 00:09:41,768
All right, so right now let's make the slime.

484
00:09:41,768 --> 00:09:43,750
- Dude, I don't even know how I'm gonna use crayons.

485
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,800
Will this even make slime dude?

486
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,755
I'm first gonna try

487
00:09:46,755 --> 00:09:48,074
to break it up and see if this works.

488
00:09:48,074 --> 00:09:49,537
I don't know this, ah.

489
00:09:49,537 --> 00:09:50,884
Whoa, dude what was that?

490
00:09:50,884 --> 00:09:51,942
- Nothing.

491
00:09:51,942 --> 00:09:53,419
Time to add the silly string.

492
00:09:53,419 --> 00:09:54,413
I broke it.

493
00:09:54,413 --> 00:09:55,421
- Whoa, I think you broke it.

494
00:09:55,421 --> 00:09:56,995
- Ah, I broke this one too.

495
00:09:56,995 --> 00:09:57,986
Oh well, I was gonna ask.

496
00:09:57,986 --> 00:09:58,899
Whoa, oh my gosh.

497
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:00,165
(yelling)

498
00:10:00,165 --> 00:10:02,800
- Enough with this, I'm gonna try using a hair dryer

499
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,924
to see how this works.

500
00:10:03,924 --> 00:10:06,028
- While you do that, I gonna add in my silly string.

501
00:10:06,028 --> 00:10:07,988
Whoa, this is a powerful one, bro.

502
00:10:07,988 --> 00:10:08,907
- [Devan] Dude.

503
00:10:08,907 --> 00:10:10,227
- Now let's see if this turns into slime.

504
00:10:10,227 --> 00:10:11,303
I'm gonna add some glue.

505
00:10:11,303 --> 00:10:12,136
- You know what Collins?

506
00:10:12,136 --> 00:10:13,203
I think I actually need some more crayons.

507
00:10:13,203 --> 00:10:14,273
- No, put it down Devan.

508
00:10:14,273 --> 00:10:15,153
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, why?

509
00:10:15,153 --> 00:10:16,317
- All right, I'm gonna add some more here now.

510
00:10:16,317 --> 00:10:17,732
Perfect.

511
00:10:17,732 --> 00:10:19,177
Long-distance shots.

512
00:10:19,177 --> 00:10:20,010
- Whoa, whoa.

513
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:20,843
- Over Devan's head. - Whoa, whoa, why?

514
00:10:20,843 --> 00:10:21,676
- Back this way.

515
00:10:21,676 --> 00:10:22,509
- Whoa.

516
00:10:22,509 --> 00:10:23,368
- Bro, it's actually working.

517
00:10:23,368 --> 00:10:24,310
Dude this is taking forever.

518
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:25,143
I can do it way faster.

519
00:10:25,143 --> 00:10:26,066
Put that down, step aside,

520
00:10:26,066 --> 00:10:27,483
and here's how we're gonna do this.

521
00:10:27,483 --> 00:10:28,316
Ready, here we go?

522
00:10:28,316 --> 00:10:29,625
(lasers shooting)

523
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:30,708
- Whoa, okay.

524
00:10:31,579 --> 00:10:32,489
- Yeah.

525
00:10:32,489 --> 00:10:34,245
I can tell you're impressed.

526
00:10:34,245 --> 00:10:35,540
- Yeah.

527
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,098
(laser shooting)

528
00:10:37,098 --> 00:10:38,592
Whoa, what?

529
00:10:38,592 --> 00:10:40,023
(laser shooting)

530
00:10:40,023 --> 00:10:40,950
Dude.

531
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:41,814
- Ah-choo.

532
00:10:41,814 --> 00:10:43,515
Ah man, I'm falling apart.

533
00:10:43,515 --> 00:10:44,348
Gah.

534
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:50,689
- It's like you're sick.

535
00:10:50,689 --> 00:10:53,522
(lasers shooting)

536
00:10:55,028 --> 00:10:55,861
Whoa.

537
00:10:55,861 --> 00:10:56,694
Oh.

538
00:10:56,694 --> 00:10:57,527
No.

539
00:10:57,527 --> 00:10:58,799
Oh. (laughing)

540
00:10:58,799 --> 00:10:59,839
Whoa.

541
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,796
Ah, tell me what is going on.

542
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:04,149
- All right, I'm good.

543
00:11:04,149 --> 00:11:05,008
- Am I safe?

544
00:11:05,008 --> 00:11:06,988
I think I'm gonna add my glue next.

545
00:11:06,988 --> 00:11:08,127
- [Collins] This is pretty sweet.

546
00:11:08,127 --> 00:11:09,575
- [Devan] They're not like mixing at all.

547
00:11:09,575 --> 00:11:10,650
- This is super bizarre, man.

548
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,108
Oh, wow.

549
00:11:12,108 --> 00:11:13,669
The silly string stopped becoming stringy

550
00:11:13,669 --> 00:11:16,154
and just really turns into like mush.

551
00:11:16,154 --> 00:11:16,987
- Ah, Collins.

552
00:11:16,987 --> 00:11:17,820
- What?

553
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:18,784
- I don't think this is working out.

554
00:11:18,784 --> 00:11:19,808
- [Collins] Dude, yours looks awesome.

555
00:11:19,808 --> 00:11:22,133
It's like a dance party happening all in your slime.

556
00:11:22,133 --> 00:11:23,415
What's really crazy is I though yours would be

557
00:11:23,415 --> 00:11:26,117
like all nice and rainbow colorful, but it's dark.

558
00:11:26,117 --> 00:11:27,515
- [Devan] Dude, it's like a ring.

559
00:11:27,515 --> 00:11:28,360
Look at that.

560
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,193
- Bro, you're married to the crayon.

561
00:11:29,193 --> 00:11:31,300
- Yeah, I'm married to the crayon life bro.

562
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,133
- Crayon life?

563
00:11:32,133 --> 00:11:34,323
- All right, I think I'm gonna add some shaving cream next.

564
00:11:34,323 --> 00:11:35,577
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, bro.

565
00:11:35,577 --> 00:11:37,346
That's expired, you can't use this.

566
00:11:37,346 --> 00:11:39,055
- I didn't know they had expiration dates.

567
00:11:39,055 --> 00:11:40,305
- Yeah, this is not fresh at all, Devan.

568
00:11:40,305 --> 00:11:41,138
- Oh really?

569
00:11:41,138 --> 00:11:42,469
- I'll show you how to get some fresh shaving cream.

570
00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:43,302
Do you smell this?

571
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:44,135
- [Devan] Ah, yeah.

572
00:11:44,135 --> 00:11:44,968
- See how it doesn't smell fresh?

573
00:11:44,968 --> 00:11:45,801
- No.

574
00:11:45,801 --> 00:11:48,381
- And there we go, perfect.

575
00:11:48,381 --> 00:11:49,214
- [Devan] Wait, what?

576
00:11:49,214 --> 00:11:50,758
- Brand-new, fresh, shaving cream.

577
00:11:50,758 --> 00:11:51,650
Smell that.

578
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:52,853
Fresher, right?

579
00:11:52,853 --> 00:11:53,686
- Sure.

580
00:11:53,686 --> 00:11:57,111
As you add, I'm gonna go wash my hands.

581
00:11:57,111 --> 00:11:59,385
- Collins, that's not how you wash your hands.

582
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,388
- It's pretty clean compared to what it used to be.

583
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:03,111
- [Devan] That's smearing your hands.

584
00:12:03,111 --> 00:12:03,944
- [Collins] There we go.

585
00:12:03,944 --> 00:12:04,997
- Yeah, you might. - Now you're cleaning

586
00:12:04,997 --> 00:12:05,830
the fridge.

587
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:06,663
- Oh, it looks great to me.

588
00:12:06,663 --> 00:12:07,496
That's like art.

589
00:12:07,496 --> 00:12:10,585
I can clean your fridge with art.

590
00:12:10,585 --> 00:12:13,184
- [Devan] You can't, oh, you just did that.

591
00:12:13,184 --> 00:12:14,128
- [Collins] There we go.

592
00:12:14,128 --> 00:12:15,624
Bump, bump, and then huh, huh and then ha.

593
00:12:15,624 --> 00:12:17,528
You can't do that if you don't have

594
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:18,361
that stuff on your fridge.

595
00:12:18,361 --> 00:12:19,225
Guys, don't ever do this to your fridge.

596
00:12:19,225 --> 00:12:20,463
It's not a good idea.

597
00:12:20,463 --> 00:12:21,653
I do not endorse it (laughs).

598
00:12:21,653 --> 00:12:23,018
Now time to be responsible and go clean up

599
00:12:23,018 --> 00:12:23,896
the mess that I made.

600
00:12:23,896 --> 00:12:24,729
Dude, see this?

601
00:12:24,729 --> 00:12:25,562
Dude, this comes off easy man.

602
00:12:25,562 --> 00:12:26,542
Don't do this at home, but still it comes off easy.

603
00:12:26,542 --> 00:12:29,306
- It's also nice and fluffy until you get

604
00:12:29,306 --> 00:12:31,763
these chards of crayons stuck in your hands.

605
00:12:31,763 --> 00:12:32,687
- Puddles, man.

606
00:12:32,687 --> 00:12:34,067
Come on, you should have had the foresight to see

607
00:12:34,067 --> 00:12:35,043
that it wouldn't work.

608
00:12:35,043 --> 00:12:35,876
- [Devan] I know man, come on.

609
00:12:35,876 --> 00:12:37,062
- [Collins] All right, I guess we're gonna add

610
00:12:37,062 --> 00:12:37,895
some of this in here.

611
00:12:37,895 --> 00:12:38,728
- [Devan] Sta-flo.

612
00:12:38,728 --> 00:12:39,630
- Dude, this is just so bad

613
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:40,733
at coming out. - What, no, no, no, no.

614
00:12:40,733 --> 00:12:41,566
Get that away from me dude.

615
00:12:41,566 --> 00:12:42,505
Sta-flo is still not doing anything dude.

616
00:12:42,505 --> 00:12:43,338
- Here we go.

617
00:12:43,338 --> 00:12:44,308
We've got some contact solution for the final step.

618
00:12:44,308 --> 00:12:45,723
Oh, ya fleet.

619
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,132
The air really tastes like baking soda.

620
00:12:48,132 --> 00:12:49,237
Ah, I burnt my nose.

621
00:12:49,237 --> 00:12:50,070
It burns.

622
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,380
All right, just gonna add some contact solution.

623
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,101
I feel like a mad scientist right now.

624
00:12:53,101 --> 00:12:55,363
- [Devan] Dude, the worst about this is the bottom.

625
00:12:55,363 --> 00:12:58,144
There's just hard, fragmented crayons on the bottom.

626
00:12:58,144 --> 00:12:59,723
- All right, just need a little bit more silly string.

627
00:12:59,723 --> 00:13:00,842
(bells ringing)

628
00:13:00,842 --> 00:13:02,616
Oh dude, oh, oh, oh, this is not good, this is not good.

629
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:03,449
- Whoa.

630
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,596
- I got it.

631
00:13:04,596 --> 00:13:06,531
Dude, bank shot man, with a pan.

632
00:13:06,531 --> 00:13:09,002
Look at this bro, master at the chef.

633
00:13:09,002 --> 00:13:10,256
(pan clanging)

634
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:11,089
- Oh.

635
00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:12,856
- Okay, I've got all the ingredients in here.

636
00:13:12,856 --> 00:13:14,788
And now it's time to see if silly string slime

637
00:13:14,788 --> 00:13:15,893
is actually gonna work.

638
00:13:15,893 --> 00:13:17,811
So Cuddles, I'm counting on you to be able to win this one.

639
00:13:17,811 --> 00:13:18,773
Let's see if this happens.

640
00:13:18,773 --> 00:13:19,715
Here we go, three,

641
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:20,658
two, one. - Two, one.

642
00:13:20,658 --> 00:13:21,661
- [Collins and Devan] Oh.

643
00:13:21,661 --> 00:13:23,194
- There's so much silly string bro.

644
00:13:23,194 --> 00:13:24,027
- Is it gonna work out?

645
00:13:24,027 --> 00:13:25,013
- I don't know man, oh.

646
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:26,282
I can kind of feel it.

647
00:13:26,282 --> 00:13:27,115
It feels like it's starting to come together a little bit.

648
00:13:27,115 --> 00:13:27,948
Ah. - Ooh.

649
00:13:27,948 --> 00:13:28,949
- It's just like juicing everywhere though.

650
00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:30,130
The real question is, will I be able to mix

651
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:31,724
this silly string into it?

652
00:13:31,724 --> 00:13:33,969
It feels kind of like styrofoam almost,

653
00:13:33,969 --> 00:13:35,042
which is really weird.

654
00:13:35,042 --> 00:13:36,979
Yo, it worked I win.

655
00:13:36,979 --> 00:13:38,065
You can get the comment down below.

656
00:13:38,065 --> 00:13:38,898
Oh no.

657
00:13:38,898 --> 00:13:39,731
- Dude, really?

658
00:13:39,731 --> 00:13:40,564
- [Collins] Oh no, well you get

659
00:13:40,564 --> 00:13:41,397
the comment down below, who won.

660
00:13:41,397 --> 00:13:42,284
Ah-huh. - Oh, they've got it all.

661
00:13:42,284 --> 00:13:43,878
- They've got my leg, he's got my leg.

662
00:13:43,878 --> 00:13:44,711
- [Devan] He's got my leg.

663
00:13:44,711 --> 00:13:45,544
- It's going down.

664
00:13:45,544 --> 00:13:46,509
It's so heavy. - They're bringing you down,

665
00:13:46,509 --> 00:13:47,342
Collins. - [Collins] It's so heavy.

666
00:13:47,342 --> 00:13:48,381
These pants won't make it.

667
00:13:48,381 --> 00:13:49,793
- He's got my leg, he's got pant leg.

668
00:13:49,793 --> 00:13:51,111
- Oh, one of them got your leg too.

669
00:13:51,111 --> 00:13:52,393
- [Devan] Ah, he loves the legs.

670
00:13:52,393 --> 00:13:53,647
- [Collins] Look at that little face.

671
00:13:53,647 --> 00:13:54,701
- He's ready to go.

672
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:55,705
Let's go race. - Dude, he's so ready

673
00:13:55,705 --> 00:13:56,746
to get some slime ingredients.

674
00:13:56,746 --> 00:13:57,579
Are you ready buddy?

675
00:13:57,579 --> 00:13:58,412
We're just gonna be watching over here Devan.

676
00:13:58,412 --> 00:13:59,245
- Huh? And just observing.

677
00:13:59,245 --> 00:14:00,163
- [Devan] Oh, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

678
00:14:00,163 --> 00:14:01,027
Go for it.

679
00:14:01,027 --> 00:14:01,860
- All right, we're gonna do this, we're gonna go for it,

680
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:02,693
we're gonna go for it.

681
00:14:02,693 --> 00:14:03,526
You ready?

682
00:14:03,526 --> 00:14:04,359
Three, two, one, and go for it.

683
00:14:04,359 --> 00:14:05,192
Get some great slime ingredients.

684
00:14:05,192 --> 00:14:06,177
All right, in order to see

685
00:14:06,177 --> 00:14:07,086
the slime ingredients, it's that way.

686
00:14:07,086 --> 00:14:08,016
- [Devan] They're this way, whoa.

687
00:14:08,016 --> 00:14:09,186
- [Collins] That would be yes.

688
00:14:09,186 --> 00:14:11,460
Love the energy, but let's get some ingredients.

689
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,974
Bubbles, perfect, I love bubbles.

690
00:14:12,974 --> 00:14:14,079
Nice, clear glue.

691
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:15,510
Love it bro, Sta-flo.

692
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:16,769
- [Devan] Ooh, All right clay, I love clay.

693
00:14:16,769 --> 00:14:18,435
Nice, shaving cream.

694
00:14:18,435 --> 00:14:19,268
Thanks Puddles.

695
00:14:19,268 --> 00:14:20,711
And hair gel, kind of slimy.

696
00:14:20,711 --> 00:14:21,862
All right, here we go, wee.

697
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:22,808
- All right, you're a good boy.

698
00:14:22,808 --> 00:14:23,641
You're a good boy.

699
00:14:23,641 --> 00:14:24,474
Ah, you're such a good boy.

700
00:14:24,474 --> 00:14:25,307
- [Devan] Oh, he wants to go that way.

701
00:14:25,307 --> 00:14:26,140
- [Collins] With a nice little leap over the leg.

702
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,836
Metallic blue pigment, sweet.

703
00:14:28,836 --> 00:14:30,220
- [Devan] DohVinci, I don't think

704
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,664
I've ever used DohVinci before.

705
00:14:31,664 --> 00:14:33,257
- Out of all the crazy things I've done,

706
00:14:33,257 --> 00:14:34,541
this is by far the wildest.

707
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:35,923
So Devan, how you feeling right now?

708
00:14:35,923 --> 00:14:37,611
- Dude, this is super weird.

709
00:14:37,611 --> 00:14:39,127
- I mean clearly you're just stuck in a bubble

710
00:14:39,127 --> 00:14:40,442
and I mean I can tell the dog's getting kind of

711
00:14:40,442 --> 00:14:41,709
tripped out right now.

712
00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:42,542
So, let's do this.

713
00:14:42,542 --> 00:14:43,465
I gotta get you out of here.

714
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:45,415
Here we go, three, two, one.

715
00:14:45,415 --> 00:14:46,248
(bubble popping)

716
00:14:46,248 --> 00:14:47,081
Holy snap - Oh.

717
00:14:47,081 --> 00:14:48,100
I actually feel solid again.

718
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,152
- All right, well right now let's make some slime.

719
00:14:50,152 --> 00:14:51,675
Yo, these great bubbles, you can literally hold

720
00:14:51,675 --> 00:14:53,344
in your hand, bro.

721
00:14:53,344 --> 00:14:54,177
This is crazy.

722
00:14:54,177 --> 00:14:55,804
- [Devan] It's not working.

723
00:14:55,804 --> 00:14:56,826
Oh, what?

724
00:14:56,826 --> 00:14:57,671
(gags)

725
00:14:57,671 --> 00:14:58,504
- [Devan] Dude.

726
00:14:58,504 --> 00:14:59,337
- Bro. - What?

727
00:14:59,337 --> 00:15:01,788
- Look at a bubble you can literally hold in your hand.

728
00:15:01,788 --> 00:15:03,493
- Wait, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it.

729
00:15:03,493 --> 00:15:04,621
Ah. - Oh my gosh.

730
00:15:04,621 --> 00:15:05,477
What? - Pass it me man.

731
00:15:05,477 --> 00:15:06,310
Pass it to me.

732
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:08,284
- All right, here you go, three, two, one.

733
00:15:08,284 --> 00:15:09,292
(bubble bounces)

734
00:15:09,292 --> 00:15:10,318
(Collins blowing)

735
00:15:10,318 --> 00:15:11,196
(metal tinging)

736
00:15:11,196 --> 00:15:12,029
(yells)

737
00:15:12,029 --> 00:15:13,481
You gotta be careful with that stuff man.

738
00:15:13,481 --> 00:15:14,314
- Why?

739
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:15,631
- 'Cause it's magic clay.

740
00:15:15,631 --> 00:15:16,522
Set it down for a second, you'll see.

741
00:15:16,522 --> 00:15:17,368
- Okay.

742
00:15:17,368 --> 00:15:18,914
Whoa, wait, what?

743
00:15:18,914 --> 00:15:20,637
Where did it go?

744
00:15:20,637 --> 00:15:21,577
Wait.

745
00:15:21,577 --> 00:15:22,844
How did it end up over here?

746
00:15:22,844 --> 00:15:24,890
- I told you man, it's magic clay, it's super easy.

747
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,146
- Um, Collins, it didn't let me grab it.

748
00:15:26,146 --> 00:15:27,804
- Oh, right over there, yeah grab it again.

749
00:15:27,804 --> 00:15:28,637
- [Devan] What?

750
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:29,885
Dude, seriously? - Sike, it's magic clay.

751
00:15:29,885 --> 00:15:30,772
(laughing)

752
00:15:30,772 --> 00:15:32,258
- Is that all it does?

753
00:15:32,258 --> 00:15:33,883
Wait, and now it's in my bowl?

754
00:15:33,883 --> 00:15:34,840
- Exactly man, it said magic clay.

755
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,004
- This is really peculiar.

756
00:15:37,004 --> 00:15:38,253
- Let me see it. - No, no, no, you can't.

757
00:15:38,253 --> 00:15:39,293
- I wanna see it for a a second.

758
00:15:39,293 --> 00:15:40,126
- Okay.

759
00:15:40,126 --> 00:15:40,959
- Are you kidding me?

760
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:41,792
- It disappeared.

761
00:15:41,792 --> 00:15:42,625
All right, here we go.

762
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:43,514
Yes, dude.

763
00:15:43,514 --> 00:15:44,347
- Oh dude, I've got an idea.

764
00:15:44,347 --> 00:15:45,256
Check this out, here we go.

765
00:15:45,256 --> 00:15:46,635
(bubble inflating)

766
00:15:46,635 --> 00:15:49,540
- Dude, that's a big bubble.

767
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,017
Um, ah, Collins.

768
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:53,000
What are you doing?

769
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,833
- I gotta get mine.

770
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:54,666
I gotta get mine.

771
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:57,226
- Ah, what is this around my head?

772
00:15:57,226 --> 00:15:59,664
Did you pop the bubble on my head?

773
00:15:59,664 --> 00:16:02,265
(collins laughs and vocalizes)

774
00:16:02,265 --> 00:16:03,098
- How do we get out of this?

775
00:16:03,098 --> 00:16:04,639
- The only way to get out is to blow out.

776
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,529
Here we go, three, two, one.

777
00:16:07,529 --> 00:16:08,555
(balloons popping)

778
00:16:08,555 --> 00:16:09,853
- I think we need this DohVinci stuff next.

779
00:16:09,853 --> 00:16:12,586
So, I think you add this in here.

780
00:16:12,586 --> 00:16:13,803
- That actually looks pretty cool man.

781
00:16:13,803 --> 00:16:14,667
Can you make like a.

782
00:16:14,667 --> 00:16:16,469
Oh, dude like a little art piece, midair.

783
00:16:16,469 --> 00:16:17,302
- Oh.

784
00:16:17,302 --> 00:16:18,135
- Do it right over here, do it.

785
00:16:18,135 --> 00:16:19,069
- What, how do you do that?

786
00:16:19,069 --> 00:16:19,902
- Just kind of squeeze it.

787
00:16:19,902 --> 00:16:20,735
- Three, two, one.

788
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,750
Whoa.

789
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:22,645
- That's so cool.

790
00:16:22,645 --> 00:16:23,978
- Yeah, but what is it?

791
00:16:23,978 --> 00:16:24,841
- That's Katy Perry.

792
00:16:24,841 --> 00:16:25,798
- How do you know that?

793
00:16:25,798 --> 00:16:27,586
- It's clearly Katy Perry, I mean look at it.

794
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:29,003
- It's just a stick figure, dude.

795
00:16:29,003 --> 00:16:30,563
- No, you'll figure it out in about two seconds.

796
00:16:30,563 --> 00:16:31,396
- Okay. - Here we go.

797
00:16:31,396 --> 00:16:32,246
One, two.

798
00:16:32,246 --> 00:16:33,828
(fireworks exploding)

799
00:16:33,828 --> 00:16:35,416
See, that was Katy Perry.

800
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:36,526
- I guess so man.

801
00:16:36,526 --> 00:16:38,216
- All right, well right now I've got some slime I'm making.

802
00:16:38,216 --> 00:16:39,665
Oh man, oh that's cool I can.

803
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:40,575
Oh. - Oh.

804
00:16:40,575 --> 00:16:41,630
(yells)

805
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:44,263
- Ah, where's a nurse?

806
00:16:44,263 --> 00:16:46,263
(yells)

807
00:16:47,235 --> 00:16:48,113
That's not gonna come out.

808
00:16:48,113 --> 00:16:50,992
Let's take a quick pause, so I can fix my shirt.

809
00:16:50,992 --> 00:16:53,396
- I'm just gonna add this DohVinci for some color, I guess.

810
00:16:53,396 --> 00:16:54,678
- [Collins] And I've got some blue pigment I'm gonna

811
00:16:54,678 --> 00:16:55,511
add to my slime.

812
00:16:55,511 --> 00:16:58,059
Whoa, look how the pigment mixes into the glue.

813
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:00,418
- Bro, this is like mixing neon noodles.

814
00:17:00,418 --> 00:17:02,285
- And mine looks like metallic right now.

815
00:17:02,285 --> 00:17:03,408
All right so now. - Whoa.

816
00:17:03,408 --> 00:17:05,144
I can gotta make a couple more bubbles, then we're gonna

817
00:17:05,144 --> 00:17:06,836
be adding it to this and literally making bubble slime

818
00:17:06,836 --> 00:17:08,345
we can just crush, which is gonna be awesome.

819
00:17:08,345 --> 00:17:09,418
Huh, you know what?

820
00:17:09,418 --> 00:17:11,042
I'm gonna put a secret message in a bubble.

821
00:17:11,042 --> 00:17:12,925
- Wait dude, wait.

822
00:17:12,925 --> 00:17:13,871
What are you saying?

823
00:17:13,871 --> 00:17:15,529
Collins, I can't understand what you're saying.

824
00:17:15,529 --> 00:17:16,782
- Here we go, you ready?

825
00:17:16,782 --> 00:17:18,615
- No, no, no, I have to know what that says.

826
00:17:18,615 --> 00:17:19,448
- Hi Devan.

827
00:17:19,448 --> 00:17:20,435
- That was too weird.

828
00:17:20,435 --> 00:17:21,407
- Yeah.

829
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,240
That was it.

830
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,073
- Okay.

831
00:17:23,073 --> 00:17:24,546
- To complete the slime, I just gotta add some Sta-flo.

832
00:17:24,546 --> 00:17:25,865
So here, we're just gonna add this in.

833
00:17:25,865 --> 00:17:26,698
Oh, you know what?

834
00:17:26,698 --> 00:17:28,043
I'm gonna add in the first preliminary bubble.

835
00:17:28,043 --> 00:17:30,026
(bubble inflating)

836
00:17:30,026 --> 00:17:32,478
Well guys, there we go and we're just gonna drop it in.

837
00:17:32,478 --> 00:17:33,421
Bloop, bubble's in.

838
00:17:33,421 --> 00:17:34,415
And let's see how this works.

839
00:17:34,415 --> 00:17:35,729
So I guess, I don't know, we just kind of use the bubble

840
00:17:35,729 --> 00:17:36,562
to mix it up, mix it up, mix it up.

841
00:17:36,562 --> 00:17:38,478
Dude, this is pretty wild.

842
00:17:38,478 --> 00:17:40,345
- [Devan] Mine is not mixing well at all.

843
00:17:40,345 --> 00:17:41,632
- I'm gonna get my hands in.

844
00:17:41,632 --> 00:17:42,635
Oh, this is weird.

845
00:17:42,635 --> 00:17:44,395
No, it's turning stringy.

846
00:17:44,395 --> 00:17:45,449
- Oh no.

847
00:17:45,449 --> 00:17:46,930
- Bro, I gotta. - You gotta save it.

848
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:48,545
- I know, this slime is like, it's super close

849
00:17:48,545 --> 00:17:49,488
to not working.

850
00:17:49,488 --> 00:17:51,439
- Nothing about that is because of Collins.

851
00:17:51,439 --> 00:17:54,429
- Yo, I fixed it bro and this looks so crazy.

852
00:17:54,429 --> 00:17:56,669
This is gotta be the greatest slime I've ever made.

853
00:17:56,669 --> 00:17:58,219
Yay.

854
00:17:58,219 --> 00:17:59,064
- Dude, it's so tough.

855
00:17:59,064 --> 00:18:00,883
- Oh man, it's like super cool.

856
00:18:00,883 --> 00:18:01,925
- It's mine now. (laughs)

857
00:18:01,925 --> 00:18:02,962
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

858
00:18:02,962 --> 00:18:03,795
- [Devan] What?

859
00:18:03,795 --> 00:18:06,342
- Whoa, ah dude I love this stuff?

860
00:18:06,342 --> 00:18:07,675
Wait, how did I end up back here?

861
00:18:07,675 --> 00:18:08,553
- [Collins] I'm confused.

862
00:18:08,553 --> 00:18:09,657
- Did you just put me in a loop?

863
00:18:09,657 --> 00:18:10,925
- I think so, I don't know.

864
00:18:10,925 --> 00:18:12,440
And now the moment of truth,

865
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,689
time to lay this over the bubbles

866
00:18:13,689 --> 00:18:15,949
and create the most satisfying bubble popping ever.

867
00:18:15,949 --> 00:18:19,606
Here we go, three, two, one, and then drape over.

868
00:18:19,606 --> 00:18:20,469
Come on, oh, there we go, there we go.

869
00:18:20,469 --> 00:18:21,358
- I got you fam, I got you.

870
00:18:21,358 --> 00:18:22,940
- [Collins] We gotta put it over like that.

871
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:23,929
- [Devan] With the assist.

872
00:18:23,929 --> 00:18:25,638
- Time to reach in pop all the bubbles.

873
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:26,516
This is gonna be so satisfying.

874
00:18:26,516 --> 00:18:28,058
Here we go, ready, three, two.

875
00:18:28,058 --> 00:18:30,106
Oh wait, if you wanna win a 15 minute video

876
00:18:30,106 --> 00:18:31,050
with Devan and I,

877
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:33,377
text the word "DOGS" to 81800 right now.

878
00:18:33,377 --> 00:18:36,430
So pause this video, text the word "DOGS" to 81800

879
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:38,054
and you'll automatically be entered in to win.

880
00:18:38,054 --> 00:18:39,047
And right now, let's do it.

881
00:18:39,047 --> 00:18:41,213
Three, two, one.

882
00:18:41,213 --> 00:18:42,527
- Oh.

883
00:18:42,527 --> 00:18:43,586
- Oh my gosh.

884
00:18:43,586 --> 00:18:44,419
- What?

885
00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:45,257
That was so cool.

886
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:47,449
- Oh my gosh, next level.

887
00:18:47,449 --> 00:18:49,223
I think I absolutely won this but you get

888
00:18:49,223 --> 00:18:50,871
to comment down below and let us know who made

889
00:18:50,871 --> 00:18:51,704
a cooler slime.

890
00:18:51,704 --> 00:18:53,423
And right now, back to the puppies for our next slime.

891
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:55,165
All right, this is the final slime.

892
00:18:55,165 --> 00:18:56,837
Are you ready to get the best ingredients yet?

893
00:18:56,837 --> 00:18:57,670
- You ready bro?

894
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:58,503
- End on a bang.

895
00:18:58,503 --> 00:18:59,470
All right, here we go guys.

896
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:00,348
- Look at his arm.

897
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:01,697
- Classy man, go the arms crossed and everything.

898
00:19:01,697 --> 00:19:02,804
- He's ready.

899
00:19:02,804 --> 00:19:04,722
- All right, three, two, one, go for it bro.

900
00:19:04,722 --> 00:19:05,925
Get some slime ingredients.

901
00:19:05,925 --> 00:19:07,629
All right in order to see the slime ingredients,

902
00:19:07,629 --> 00:19:08,558
it's that way.

903
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:09,580
- They're this way.

904
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,880
Whoa, whoa.

905
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,603
- [Collins] First up we got Sta-flo, nice.

906
00:19:12,603 --> 00:19:13,871
No, not glitter glue, come on.

907
00:19:13,871 --> 00:19:15,156
Ear plugs, what?

908
00:19:15,156 --> 00:19:16,393
- [Devan] Baking soda, unconventional, but usable.

909
00:19:16,393 --> 00:19:18,032
Weird, a blender.

910
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:19,611
At least I got white glue.

911
00:19:19,611 --> 00:19:20,814
Oh, and Sta-flo, nice.

912
00:19:20,814 --> 00:19:22,699
- All right Bubbles, you have the most important job,

913
00:19:22,699 --> 00:19:24,435
you gotta pick the last slime ingredient.

914
00:19:24,435 --> 00:19:25,300
Are your ready buddy?

915
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,133
All right, here we go three,

916
00:19:26,133 --> 00:19:26,966
two, one. - [Devan] Two, one.

917
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:27,834
- [Collins] Wait, chapstick.

918
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,362
- [Devan] Ah, Bubbles picked squishies.

919
00:19:29,362 --> 00:19:31,753
- I do kind of feel bad, but I think my first step

920
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,281
is gonna be to cut these things up.

921
00:19:33,281 --> 00:19:34,495
- That's so wrong.

922
00:19:34,495 --> 00:19:35,752
Oh, no, no, no.

923
00:19:35,752 --> 00:19:36,585
- [Devan] Start with an ear.

924
00:19:36,585 --> 00:19:37,418
- Oh.

925
00:19:37,418 --> 00:19:38,251
- [Devan] And maybe a little foot.

926
00:19:38,251 --> 00:19:39,084
- This feels very bizarre.

927
00:19:39,084 --> 00:19:40,227
I kind of wanna join in though, so her we go

928
00:19:40,227 --> 00:19:41,189
we have panda squishy. - No, no, no, no.

929
00:19:41,189 --> 00:19:42,076
This is my slime.

930
00:19:42,076 --> 00:19:42,909
- I wanna try something. - What?

931
00:19:42,909 --> 00:19:43,972
No, no. - There we go.

932
00:19:43,972 --> 00:19:44,805
- No.

933
00:19:44,805 --> 00:19:46,442
Dude, this is far more satisfying than you think.

934
00:19:46,442 --> 00:19:49,854
(yells, laughs)

935
00:19:49,854 --> 00:19:51,382
- All right, I've got my cutting board and the chap stick.

936
00:19:51,382 --> 00:19:52,326
So, here's what I'm about to do for.

937
00:19:52,326 --> 00:19:53,159
(blender blending)

938
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:54,763
Devan, I'm, okay, there we go, thank you.

939
00:19:54,763 --> 00:19:55,596
Now for the.

940
00:19:55,596 --> 00:19:56,429
(blender blending)

941
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:57,262
Are you kidding me? - What?

942
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:58,095
- So I'm gonna be using the chap stick.

943
00:19:58,095 --> 00:19:58,928
(blender blending)

944
00:19:58,928 --> 00:19:59,761
Devan!

945
00:19:59,761 --> 00:20:00,594
- What?

946
00:20:00,594 --> 00:20:01,427
- I'm trying to explain this.

947
00:20:01,427 --> 00:20:02,288
This is out of control.

948
00:20:02,288 --> 00:20:05,121
(blender buzzing)

949
00:20:09,486 --> 00:20:10,319
There you go.

950
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:11,859
- Dude, I think you broke my blender.

951
00:20:11,859 --> 00:20:13,178
- No Devan, I made it better because now,

952
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:14,637
it can't cut me off anymore.

953
00:20:14,637 --> 00:20:16,201
So instead of it being a blender, you now have

954
00:20:16,201 --> 00:20:17,775
a hand-crank blender.

955
00:20:17,775 --> 00:20:19,257
You just spin this little thingy over here

956
00:20:19,257 --> 00:20:20,167
and what you're gonna use for your blender.

957
00:20:20,167 --> 00:20:21,593
- It's old-fashioned dude.

958
00:20:21,593 --> 00:20:24,067
- So it will give me time to properly explain.

959
00:20:24,067 --> 00:20:25,368
Gonna empty my chap stick down here.

960
00:20:25,368 --> 00:20:26,878
Ah, you hear that?

961
00:20:26,878 --> 00:20:27,825
Silence, I love it.

962
00:20:27,825 --> 00:20:30,518
All right, it's time to mash it up.

963
00:20:30,518 --> 00:20:31,879
Here we go.

964
00:20:31,879 --> 00:20:34,796
(hammers pounding)

965
00:20:37,201 --> 00:20:38,060
Whoa man.

966
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,477
That's enough with the hammers.

967
00:20:39,477 --> 00:20:41,149
Right now, let's grab this little thingy here.

968
00:20:41,149 --> 00:20:45,099
I don't know what this does, but that works really nicely.

969
00:20:45,099 --> 00:20:46,448
We can finally add it in, we're on to the next.

970
00:20:46,448 --> 00:20:47,762
- No, I have to mix my glue first.

971
00:20:47,762 --> 00:20:48,867
I mean my slime. (laughs)

972
00:20:48,867 --> 00:20:49,843
- You have to make your glue.

973
00:20:49,843 --> 00:20:52,638
All right, and the chap stick is in.

974
00:20:52,638 --> 00:20:54,100
All right, next up, here go, I've got my glue.

975
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,843
No, dude, it's glitter. - Ah.

976
00:20:55,843 --> 00:20:57,143
- [Collins] Bubbles, why would you choose glitter?

977
00:20:57,143 --> 00:20:57,976
Come on.

978
00:20:57,976 --> 00:21:00,199
I've never heard of chap stick working in slime before.

979
00:21:00,199 --> 00:21:01,416
So either this is gonna be really cool,

980
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:03,203
or this is the worst slime I've ever made.

981
00:21:03,203 --> 00:21:04,861
All right now, we're gonna mix up the chap stick

982
00:21:04,861 --> 00:21:05,900
and the glue together.

983
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,068
Now it's time to add them in.

984
00:21:07,068 --> 00:21:08,776
My slime is now fully soundproof.

985
00:21:08,776 --> 00:21:10,063
- Now it's time to add my squishies.

986
00:21:10,063 --> 00:21:11,330
I'm gonna do it very slowly.

987
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:12,610
- [Collins] Whoa.

988
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:14,010
All right, and now time for the Sta-flo.

989
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:14,843
Oh, oh.

990
00:21:17,912 --> 00:21:19,555
- [Devan] This is the best thing ever.

991
00:21:19,555 --> 00:21:20,388
- Oh my gosh.

992
00:21:20,388 --> 00:21:22,527
My slime is like it has a whole bunch of baby carrots

993
00:21:22,527 --> 00:21:23,944
in it man, like all these ear plugs

994
00:21:23,944 --> 00:21:25,079
are not helping it at all, but.

995
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:25,912
- [Devan] Dude.

996
00:21:25,912 --> 00:21:27,255
- I don't know if this is a win or fail or what,

997
00:21:27,255 --> 00:21:28,783
but you get the comment down below.

998
00:21:28,783 --> 00:21:29,874
Who won this round?

999
00:21:29,874 --> 00:21:30,877
- Mines a total win.

1000
00:21:30,877 --> 00:21:32,442
- The only person I've ever seen make slime

1001
00:21:32,442 --> 00:21:33,775
with squishies is simply me.

1002
00:21:33,775 --> 00:21:35,516
We're outside, and it's time for the slime dump.

1003
00:21:35,516 --> 00:21:37,302
- How about this, we do a double slime dump?

1004
00:21:37,302 --> 00:21:39,620
- Oh snap, we've never done that before.

1005
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,603
And now, we have Devan back to perform

1006
00:21:41,603 --> 00:21:43,519
the double slime dump on himself.

1007
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:45,843
Two buckets, two hands, one dump.

1008
00:21:45,843 --> 00:21:47,241
Here we go.

1009
00:21:47,241 --> 00:21:48,074
Ready and.

1010
00:21:50,132 --> 00:21:51,091
I swear we were like this close.

1011
00:21:51,091 --> 00:21:52,605
- While I was away, I got you a chair.

1012
00:21:52,605 --> 00:21:54,244
- Wait, is this, what's up with chair?

1013
00:21:54,244 --> 00:21:56,213
- There you go, 'cause you're getting dumped first.

1014
00:21:56,213 --> 00:21:57,046
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1015
00:21:57,046 --> 00:21:57,879
How me first?

1016
00:21:57,879 --> 00:21:59,180
How about we do a rock, paper, scissors battle

1017
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,333
to see who has to go first.

1018
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:01,391
- I don't like those odds.

1019
00:22:01,391 --> 00:22:02,263
- Rock.

1020
00:22:02,263 --> 00:22:03,911
- Paper, what is that?

1021
00:22:03,911 --> 00:22:05,240
- I'm thinking about strategy, okay here we go.

1022
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,858
- [Both] Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

1023
00:22:07,858 --> 00:22:09,465
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

1024
00:22:09,465 --> 00:22:10,298
(bell ringing)

1025
00:22:10,298 --> 00:22:11,131
- Hey!

1026
00:22:11,131 --> 00:22:11,964
- Two out of three, two out of three.

1027
00:22:11,964 --> 00:22:13,143
- [Both] Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

1028
00:22:13,143 --> 00:22:13,976
- No!

1029
00:22:13,976 --> 00:22:15,431
- [Both] Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

1030
00:22:15,431 --> 00:22:16,440
- Yes!

1031
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,369
- No!

1032
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:18,474
- Sit down, the chair is all yours.

1033
00:22:18,474 --> 00:22:21,023
- Oh, I just had a crazy idea of how we could do this, Boss.

1034
00:22:21,023 --> 00:22:22,161
- Oh sweet.

1035
00:22:22,161 --> 00:22:23,137
- Let me show you, so basically, sit down.

1036
00:22:23,137 --> 00:22:23,997
- All right.

1037
00:22:23,997 --> 00:22:24,911
- So imagine I'm gonna sit down first,

1038
00:22:24,911 --> 00:22:25,853
and then you're gonna pick up the bucket,

1039
00:22:25,853 --> 00:22:27,154
and then you'll be back here like this, okay?

1040
00:22:27,154 --> 00:22:28,422
And then you're gonna countdown.

1041
00:22:28,422 --> 00:22:29,852
You're gonna go three, two. - Whoa whoa whoa, wait.

1042
00:22:29,852 --> 00:22:31,361
Wait wait wait.

1043
00:22:31,361 --> 00:22:32,583
This is not right.

1044
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:33,502
- What do you mean?

1045
00:22:33,502 --> 00:22:34,335
- What are you about to dunk that on me?

1046
00:22:34,335 --> 00:22:35,216
- No, not at all.

1047
00:22:35,216 --> 00:22:36,321
I know how we can do this.

1048
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:37,154
Two chairs.

1049
00:22:37,154 --> 00:22:37,987
- Okay.

1050
00:22:37,987 --> 00:22:39,289
- All right, so we will both sit down this.

1051
00:22:39,289 --> 00:22:40,688
- All right, yeah, we're sitting down.

1052
00:22:40,688 --> 00:22:41,521
- No you're not.

1053
00:22:41,521 --> 00:22:42,354
- What?

1054
00:22:42,354 --> 00:22:43,187
- Sit down now.

1055
00:22:43,187 --> 00:22:44,020
So basically like, imagine you would take the bucket

1056
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,098
and you would go three, two, one.

1057
00:22:45,098 --> 00:22:46,106
- Whoa whoa whoa, okay, okay, that's.

1058
00:22:46,106 --> 00:22:46,965
Got me a little nervous there.

1059
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:47,798
You know what?

1060
00:22:47,798 --> 00:22:50,150
I think if you just sit there, and I just take it from here,

1061
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,838
and just like three, two.

1062
00:22:51,838 --> 00:22:52,671
- No, Devan. - What?

1063
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:53,504
- Stop it.

1064
00:22:53,504 --> 00:22:54,337
Do you know what?

1065
00:22:54,337 --> 00:22:55,170
I don't think a chair's gonna work.

1066
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:56,003
We can kinda like, scratch this off.

1067
00:22:56,003 --> 00:22:56,836
Here's how it's gonna go.

1068
00:22:56,836 --> 00:22:57,669
You're gonna stand regular, I'm gonna dump it on you,

1069
00:22:57,669 --> 00:22:58,894
we'll get you a little step stool, you can step on that,

1070
00:22:58,894 --> 00:22:59,920
then you can dump it on me.

1071
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,938
So you get slime dumped first.

1072
00:23:00,938 --> 00:23:02,033
- [Devan] Sounds like a deal.

1073
00:23:02,033 --> 00:23:02,866
- Why are we shaking on it?

1074
00:23:02,866 --> 00:23:03,699
- You get dumped first.

1075
00:23:03,699 --> 00:23:04,532
All right. - What?

1076
00:23:04,532 --> 00:23:05,365
- Hell yeah. - Oh come on.

1077
00:23:05,365 --> 00:23:06,198
- It worked.

1078
00:23:06,198 --> 00:23:07,031
- I got duped.

1079
00:23:07,031 --> 00:23:07,962
All right, so if I'm getting slime dumped first,

1080
00:23:07,962 --> 00:23:09,410
that means you need to get a step stool or something.

1081
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:11,083
- I was actually very prepared for this moment.

1082
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:12,185
Very sturdy.

1083
00:23:12,185 --> 00:23:13,714
- So I don't know, can you dump it from here.

1084
00:23:13,714 --> 00:23:15,067
- Yes, I think I got some height.

1085
00:23:15,067 --> 00:23:16,121
Maybe if you come down a little bit.

1086
00:23:16,121 --> 00:23:16,954
- Like this?

1087
00:23:16,954 --> 00:23:18,039
- Yeah, like right there, that seems about right.

1088
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:18,872
- Are you sure about this?

1089
00:23:18,872 --> 00:23:19,705
- Yeah, positive.

1090
00:23:19,705 --> 00:23:20,575
All right, I'm gonna grab the bucket.

1091
00:23:20,575 --> 00:23:21,467
You ready for this?

1092
00:23:21,467 --> 00:23:22,317
- No. - All right.

1093
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:23,487
Three. - Oh gosh, no no.

1094
00:23:23,487 --> 00:23:24,346
- Ugh.

1095
00:23:24,346 --> 00:23:25,179
- What?

1096
00:23:25,179 --> 00:23:26,012
- Do you know what?

1097
00:23:26,012 --> 00:23:26,914
I don't think I can do it.

1098
00:23:26,914 --> 00:23:27,922
I think you need to be in the chair again.

1099
00:23:27,922 --> 00:23:28,800
Here we go for the slime dump.

1100
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,633
You ready for this? - Oh, no.

1101
00:23:29,633 --> 00:23:30,490
Wait, you're not gonna do it from that side?

1102
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:31,323
- What?

1103
00:23:31,323 --> 00:23:32,716
- I don't know.

1104
00:23:32,716 --> 00:23:34,262
- Here we go, slime dump. - Oh no.

1105
00:23:34,262 --> 00:23:35,577
- Three.

1106
00:23:35,577 --> 00:23:36,440
- God, not again.

1107
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,273
- Two.

1108
00:23:37,273 --> 00:23:38,106
- Oh no.

1109
00:23:38,106 --> 00:23:38,939
- One!

1110
00:23:38,939 --> 00:23:41,606
(slime pouring)

1111
00:23:44,363 --> 00:23:46,518
(yelling)

1112
00:23:46,518 --> 00:23:47,685
- It's so cold! - Oh.

1113
00:23:47,685 --> 00:23:49,067
- It is so cold!

1114
00:23:49,067 --> 00:23:50,303
And it's so slimy!

1115
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:51,603
It's in my eye!

1116
00:23:51,603 --> 00:23:52,436
- You okay?

1117
00:23:52,436 --> 00:23:53,269
- No!

1118
00:23:53,269 --> 00:23:54,121
Well now it's time for you to get slime.

1119
00:23:54,121 --> 00:23:55,067
- Yeah, that's right, dude.

1120
00:23:55,067 --> 00:23:55,900
- Oh.

1121
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:56,733
(stammers, yells)

1122
00:23:56,733 --> 00:23:58,156
- That's the scariest part, dude.

1123
00:23:58,156 --> 00:23:58,989
- Dude dude dude dude.

1124
00:23:58,989 --> 00:23:59,822
- You okay?

1125
00:23:59,822 --> 00:24:00,831
- I feel like I'm ice skating.

1126
00:24:00,831 --> 00:24:01,664
(both yelling)

1127
00:24:01,664 --> 00:24:02,753
I'm like doing a little dance, it's like (yells).

1128
00:24:02,753 --> 00:24:03,586
Every which way.

1129
00:24:03,586 --> 00:24:04,419
I got a lot of.

1130
00:24:04,419 --> 00:24:05,252
- It's getting over me now.

1131
00:24:05,252 --> 00:24:06,085
- I'm gonna rotate this way.

1132
00:24:06,085 --> 00:24:06,918
- Okay.

1133
00:24:06,918 --> 00:24:07,751
- And then kinda like, pull my arms.

1134
00:24:07,751 --> 00:24:08,584
- I'll pull you, yeah, go a little this way.

1135
00:24:08,584 --> 00:24:09,417
- I'm gliding.

1136
00:24:09,417 --> 00:24:10,848
- Switch, no no no, this way.

1137
00:24:10,848 --> 00:24:13,597
- All right, Devan, you ready to get slime dumped, bro?

1138
00:24:13,597 --> 00:24:14,619
- I'm ready, I'm ready.

1139
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:15,840
- Gotta take in my surroundings here

1140
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,219
before I slime dump you, I gotta.

1141
00:24:17,219 --> 00:24:18,052
- Really?

1142
00:24:18,052 --> 00:24:18,885
- Gotta little scoot around here.

1143
00:24:18,885 --> 00:24:19,718
- Seems like you're having way too much fun with this.

1144
00:24:19,718 --> 00:24:21,952
- And then a little, little scoot around over here.

1145
00:24:21,952 --> 00:24:23,361
- Is it because it didn't get on your face?

1146
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:25,444
- All right, Devan, are you ready to get slime dumped?

1147
00:24:25,444 --> 00:24:26,277
- Yup.

1148
00:24:26,277 --> 00:24:27,673
- This is a ton of slime, bro.

1149
00:24:27,673 --> 00:24:28,969
It's like sloshing around man, it's just like.

1150
00:24:28,969 --> 00:24:30,534
- Dude dude dude dude. - Look at it, bro.

1151
00:24:30,534 --> 00:24:31,620
It's just sloshing everywhere. - I get it.

1152
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,453
I did it to you.

1153
00:24:32,453 --> 00:24:33,408
- See, you have slime dumped, Devan,

1154
00:24:33,408 --> 00:24:34,630
in quite a little while, so.

1155
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:35,586
- I know.

1156
00:24:35,586 --> 00:24:36,494
- It's gonna be a different feeling for you.

1157
00:24:36,494 --> 00:24:37,862
All right, here we go and comment down below

1158
00:24:37,862 --> 00:24:40,805
what color slime should we use for a slime dump next time.

1159
00:24:40,805 --> 00:24:43,453
And Devan, we're gonna go slow and slimy on this one.

1160
00:24:43,453 --> 00:24:44,687
- No no no, fast and quick, get it over with.

1161
00:24:44,687 --> 00:24:45,520
- Nope.

1162
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,062
Oh my gosh, I'm sorry, bro.

1163
00:24:47,062 --> 00:24:48,283
- What was that?

1164
00:24:48,283 --> 00:24:49,272
- I did, that was not on purpose, all right.

1165
00:24:49,272 --> 00:24:50,105
- What was that?

1166
00:24:50,105 --> 00:24:50,938
- That was a little bit premature, all right.

1167
00:24:50,938 --> 00:24:51,771
- You can't do two slime dumps.

1168
00:24:51,771 --> 00:24:52,881
- That's not two slime dumps, that's just a little bit

1169
00:24:52,881 --> 00:24:53,856
of the bucket. - Really?

1170
00:24:53,856 --> 00:24:54,979
- I'm gonna dump it on your right now, here we go.

1171
00:24:54,979 --> 00:24:55,857
- My lap is freezing.

1172
00:24:55,857 --> 00:24:57,237
- Three, two, one.

1173
00:24:57,237 --> 00:24:59,904
(slime pouring)

1174
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,955
(yelling)

1175
00:25:10,955 --> 00:25:11,788
- Dude, it's so cold.

1176
00:25:11,788 --> 00:25:12,644
(yelling)

1177
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:13,686
- All right, well that is it.

1178
00:25:13,686 --> 00:25:14,637
Thank you guys so much for watching, we love you guys.

1179
00:25:14,637 --> 00:25:15,470
- [Both] Bye.
