1
00:00:00,232 --> 00:00:02,309
- You challenged us to make a poop emoji,

2
00:00:02,309 --> 00:00:03,472
out of a cupcake.

3
00:00:03,472 --> 00:00:05,413
- Bro, I sure hope this is frosting.

4
00:00:05,413 --> 00:00:06,857
- Me too.

5
00:00:06,857 --> 00:00:08,289
All right, right now, let's begin.

6
00:00:08,289 --> 00:00:09,716
Dude, it's not open.

7
00:00:09,716 --> 00:00:10,656
- Go, you gotta cut it first.

8
00:00:10,656 --> 00:00:11,865
(screaming)

9
00:00:11,865 --> 00:00:13,817
- Dude, you're messing up my vibes.

10
00:00:13,817 --> 00:00:15,227
Oh no no no no.

11
00:00:15,227 --> 00:00:16,883
It's all coming out, I can't stop it.

12
00:00:16,883 --> 00:00:18,912
Dude, it's relentless, oh my gosh.

13
00:00:18,912 --> 00:00:19,981
- Bro, what are you doing?

14
00:00:19,981 --> 00:00:22,022
It's suppose to be an emoji, not the real thing.

15
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,742
- I'm all about photorealism, Devan.

16
00:00:23,742 --> 00:00:26,427
- Photorealism, this is actually straight up realism.

17
00:00:26,427 --> 00:00:29,184
- [Collin] Whoa, we got eyeballs all over right now.

18
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:30,509
Dude, my thing can see everything.

19
00:00:30,509 --> 00:00:31,953
This poop has seen it all.

20
00:00:31,953 --> 00:00:32,786
- [Devan] Bro.

21
00:00:32,786 --> 00:00:33,668
- It's seen it all.

22
00:00:33,668 --> 00:00:35,648
- [Devan] Like what did you eat to have that come out?

23
00:00:35,648 --> 00:00:37,471
- You've got Devan's approach,

24
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:39,357
which he's just doing little basic eyes.

25
00:00:39,357 --> 00:00:41,062
And I got a spider approach man,

26
00:00:41,062 --> 00:00:42,414
my thing can see everything.

27
00:00:42,414 --> 00:00:44,007
- Bro, you dissing my eyes?

28
00:00:44,007 --> 00:00:45,005
- Your eyes are huge by the way.

29
00:00:45,005 --> 00:00:47,083
- Well yeah, that's how the poop emoji is, bro.

30
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:47,916
- Oh really?

31
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:48,749
- Yeah.

32
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:50,019
- It's like whassup guys, I'm the poop emoji.

33
00:00:50,019 --> 00:00:53,220
- Bro that poop looks terrifying, what happened to him?

34
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,378
Bro what are you doing, I thought it was perfect.

35
00:00:54,378 --> 00:00:55,483
- I'm giving my eyeballs eyebrows

36
00:00:55,483 --> 00:00:56,355
- What?

37
00:00:56,355 --> 00:00:59,117
- And done, that completes the first round ever of our

38
00:00:59,117 --> 00:01:01,387
cupcake art challenge and you get to comment

39
00:01:01,387 --> 00:01:04,192
down below and let us know who won because this is a battle.

40
00:01:04,192 --> 00:01:07,996
It's brother vs brother and you decide who wins each round.

41
00:01:07,996 --> 00:01:08,829
And at the end of this,

42
00:01:08,829 --> 00:01:10,265
we're going to be eating this cupcake,

43
00:01:10,265 --> 00:01:12,589
along with all the rest, all at once.

44
00:01:12,589 --> 00:01:13,893
Stick around for that but right now,

45
00:01:13,893 --> 00:01:15,633
we're on to the next round.

46
00:01:15,633 --> 00:01:18,509
The game has changed, we're not using one cupcake,

47
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:20,027
we're not using two cupcakes,

48
00:01:20,027 --> 00:01:21,446
we're using one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

49
00:01:21,446 --> 00:01:22,385
eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thir...

50
00:01:22,385 --> 00:01:23,624
Fourteen cupcakes.

51
00:01:23,624 --> 00:01:24,967
Because we're making a unicorn,

52
00:01:24,967 --> 00:01:26,488
which you guys challenged us to make.

53
00:01:26,488 --> 00:01:27,321
- [Devan] Yeah.

54
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:28,154
- [Collin] So, we're going to have to configure

55
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:29,836
all these different cupcakes, into a unicorn's head.

56
00:01:29,836 --> 00:01:30,669
- Good luck.

57
00:01:30,669 --> 00:01:31,584
- Uh, I don't know how to do this.

58
00:01:31,584 --> 00:01:32,417
Begin.

59
00:01:32,417 --> 00:01:33,776
- [Devan] Okay, this is, I don't even know what

60
00:01:33,776 --> 00:01:34,615
I'm doing really.

61
00:01:34,615 --> 00:01:35,623
- I have my own configuration

62
00:01:35,623 --> 00:01:37,116
I think I'm going to win this game with.

63
00:01:37,116 --> 00:01:38,051
- [Devan] I'm going to do this, this.

64
00:01:38,051 --> 00:01:39,147
- [Collin] This this.

65
00:01:39,147 --> 00:01:41,332
- [Voice From Spongebob Squarepants] Twelve seconds later.

66
00:01:41,332 --> 00:01:43,071
- [Devan] What is that?

67
00:01:43,071 --> 00:01:45,100
- Call me Beyonce, 'cause it's a formation.

68
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,185
- All right, I'm adding this.

69
00:01:48,185 --> 00:01:49,518
Maybe I should use a knife instead.

70
00:01:49,518 --> 00:01:52,174
- Whee, my idea, definitely didn't see Devan doing this

71
00:01:52,174 --> 00:01:55,011
and then completely copy him, is to frost my cakes.

72
00:01:55,011 --> 00:01:57,521
My unicorn is a pure bred stallion.

73
00:01:57,521 --> 00:02:00,122
- Bro, it literally is, cupcakes are pure bread.

74
00:02:00,122 --> 00:02:01,100
(laughs)

75
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,878
- Jokes, I'm making my dude 3D.

76
00:02:02,878 --> 00:02:05,042
His eyeball is really popping out of his head.

77
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:06,155
Do you know what's cute, Devan?

78
00:02:06,155 --> 00:02:06,988
- Me.

79
00:02:09,107 --> 00:02:11,065
- No, it's how this little nose goes.

80
00:02:11,065 --> 00:02:12,260
Why is it dripping sauce?

81
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,638
All right, I gotta mix it up in a different way

82
00:02:13,638 --> 00:02:14,651
because that was not working.

83
00:02:14,651 --> 00:02:16,106
So here we go just gotta, gotta give it the squeeze,

84
00:02:16,106 --> 00:02:17,321
squeeze, squish, squish, squish

85
00:02:17,321 --> 00:02:18,154
ga, gish, gish.

86
00:02:18,154 --> 00:02:18,987
Ow.

87
00:02:18,987 --> 00:02:19,820
(laugh)

88
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,692
- That laugh, dude.

89
00:02:21,692 --> 00:02:24,952
(upbeat music)

90
00:02:24,952 --> 00:02:27,114
- Alright here's the snout, and then you know what

91
00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:28,567
every snout needs right?

92
00:02:28,567 --> 00:02:30,304
- A nose! - No, a nostril.

93
00:02:30,304 --> 00:02:32,257
Boom he got a big old nostril.

94
00:02:32,257 --> 00:02:33,455
He stays fully flared.

95
00:02:33,455 --> 00:02:34,827
He's like...

96
00:02:34,827 --> 00:02:35,878
Bro he probably smells everything.

97
00:02:35,878 --> 00:02:36,943
He has probably smelled every smell

98
00:02:36,943 --> 00:02:38,070
there is to smell in this world, man.

99
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:38,903
- Probably!

100
00:02:38,903 --> 00:02:40,297
- He's like 85 miles away he's like (sniff)

101
00:02:40,297 --> 00:02:41,223
is that Chinese food?

102
00:02:41,223 --> 00:02:44,072
Every good unicorn has got a real good comb over.

103
00:02:44,072 --> 00:02:45,980
- My unicorn is going to be a baby unicorn,

104
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,686
cuz this horn is not turning out right.

105
00:02:47,686 --> 00:02:48,800
It's way too small.

106
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,403
- Why the heck are you crunching up a pancake Devan

107
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:52,170
- I'm sorry, did anybody else just catch that?

108
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,115
What am I crunching up right now Collin?

109
00:02:54,115 --> 00:02:56,593
- Oh no, I'm stuck in pancake land.

110
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,158
- Alright, it is time to get a little bit messy

111
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:00,123
because this isn't working at all.

112
00:03:00,123 --> 00:03:01,488
So I'm going to grab some of this...

113
00:03:01,488 --> 00:03:02,609
Oh my goodness.

114
00:03:02,609 --> 00:03:03,442
Okay.

115
00:03:03,442 --> 00:03:04,275
It completely ruined this.

116
00:03:04,275 --> 00:03:05,140
The horn is gone.

117
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,788
(upbeat music)

118
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:09,409
- This is where things get crazy.

119
00:03:09,409 --> 00:03:10,871
I'm about to turn

120
00:03:10,871 --> 00:03:13,846
my unicorn horn into something spectacular.

121
00:03:13,846 --> 00:03:15,026
(screaming)

122
00:03:15,026 --> 00:03:16,923
Hearts, hearts, hearts hearts.

123
00:03:16,923 --> 00:03:18,840
We got cubes, yeah boi.

124
00:03:19,871 --> 00:03:22,852
We got stars 'cause my unicorn is a star,

125
00:03:22,852 --> 00:03:25,459
a great big shining star.

126
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:26,583
Boom.

127
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:27,416
My bad.

128
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,830
We got sprinkles, sprinkles sprinkles.

129
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,160
We got freckles.

130
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,333
His name is Freckles.

131
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:35,152
He's got freckles and his freckles are edible.

132
00:03:35,152 --> 00:03:36,444
We got green stripe.

133
00:03:36,444 --> 00:03:37,483
Yeah. Woo.

134
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:39,183
That's a really cool color of green.

135
00:03:39,183 --> 00:03:41,646
Bro, I have the finishing, final touch.

136
00:03:41,646 --> 00:03:45,196
F-R-E-C-K-L-E!

137
00:03:45,196 --> 00:03:46,351
You ready for it Devan?

138
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:48,768
The final letter S, Freckles.

139
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,930
I literally did it guys, I made Freckles.

140
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:55,165
(upbeat music)

141
00:03:55,165 --> 00:03:58,192
- Alright, it is time to bedazzle my unicorn.

142
00:03:58,192 --> 00:04:00,771
- We can't even call that a unicorn, you have no horn Devan.

143
00:04:00,771 --> 00:04:02,663
Oh my gosh - It's a horn!

144
00:04:02,663 --> 00:04:04,411
- What have you done to your unicorn.

145
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,689
- Dude it has a metal horn--

146
00:04:05,689 --> 00:04:07,166
- You're gonna scar Freckles!

147
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:08,101
- This is unicorn land.

148
00:04:08,101 --> 00:04:09,709
This is a metal horn.

149
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:10,701
- I don't think so.

150
00:04:10,701 --> 00:04:11,903
- Maybe not, it was a bad idea.

151
00:04:11,903 --> 00:04:12,798
- So he ain't a unicorn.

152
00:04:12,798 --> 00:04:13,917
So by default,

153
00:04:13,917 --> 00:04:15,452
Freckles wins this round.

154
00:04:15,452 --> 00:04:17,365
- But can you even really call that a horn?

155
00:04:17,365 --> 00:04:18,524
I don't know!

156
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:20,124
- That's a magnificent horn

157
00:04:20,124 --> 00:04:22,537
- I mean it must've really hurt to get all those letters

158
00:04:22,537 --> 00:04:24,570
implanted on his horn.

159
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,681
- Freckles will go the extra distance

160
00:04:26,681 --> 00:04:28,843
so people know his name.

161
00:04:28,843 --> 00:04:30,053
For round number three,

162
00:04:30,053 --> 00:04:31,962
We are doing a flash, speed round because you guys

163
00:04:31,962 --> 00:04:34,192
challenged us to do Toad from Mario Odyssey.

164
00:04:34,192 --> 00:04:36,638
So, let's right now, get down, we've got 90 seconds.

165
00:04:36,638 --> 00:04:37,634
Begin.

166
00:04:37,634 --> 00:04:38,631
- Wait, oh my gosh!

167
00:04:38,631 --> 00:04:39,464
- Here we go,

168
00:04:39,464 --> 00:04:40,612
Toad, Toad, Toad.

169
00:04:40,612 --> 00:04:43,112
What'd we have to do for Toad.

170
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:46,651
Dude, Toad's going to be pretty easy.

171
00:04:46,651 --> 00:04:48,064
I think I might take the win on this one.

172
00:04:48,064 --> 00:04:49,188
- I've got this!

173
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:50,743
- [Collin] Frosting!

174
00:04:50,743 --> 00:04:52,390
- [Devan] Yeah!

175
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:55,705
- Woo, I think my yelling, it makes me,

176
00:04:55,705 --> 00:04:56,914
helps me concentrate.

177
00:04:56,914 --> 00:04:58,120
I can't talk right now because I'm so focused.

178
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,453
Balls to make concentration.

179
00:05:01,508 --> 00:05:03,074
The spread moment has come.

180
00:05:03,074 --> 00:05:05,657
Spread, spread, spread, spread,

181
00:05:07,496 --> 00:05:08,373
- Okay!

182
00:05:08,373 --> 00:05:09,206
- Where's the black at?

183
00:05:09,206 --> 00:05:10,039
Yeah.

184
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:10,872
There it is.

185
00:05:10,872 --> 00:05:13,261
I got it, I got the eyes. - I got the eyes.

186
00:05:13,261 --> 00:05:14,402
Sparkle.

187
00:05:14,402 --> 00:05:15,649
- Wait, I need some.

188
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,227
Wait I need some.

189
00:05:17,227 --> 00:05:18,675
- No, and done.

190
00:05:18,675 --> 00:05:19,763
Time is up.

191
00:05:19,763 --> 00:05:21,093
You were never able to grab my sparkles.

192
00:05:21,093 --> 00:05:22,494
Alright, the big reveal.

193
00:05:22,494 --> 00:05:23,897
Let's see how these turned out, man.

194
00:05:23,897 --> 00:05:25,546
That sparkle at the end might not have been the best move.

195
00:05:25,546 --> 00:05:26,508
- I don't know!

196
00:05:26,508 --> 00:05:27,855
- Three, two... - Three, two...

197
00:05:27,855 --> 00:05:30,210
- Wait, wait, wait, first, five second subscribe challenge.

198
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,122
I want to see if you can subscribe to this channel

199
00:05:32,122 --> 00:05:35,003
and turn on the channel post notifications in five seconds.

200
00:05:35,003 --> 00:05:35,836
Ready for it?

201
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:36,669
- Yeah I'm ready

202
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,169
- Five, four, three, two, one.

203
00:05:40,129 --> 00:05:40,962
Done.

204
00:05:40,962 --> 00:05:42,303
- If you can do that, comment down below,

205
00:05:42,303 --> 00:05:43,478
Keyper Squad right now.

206
00:05:43,478 --> 00:05:44,644
And here's the big reveal.

207
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:45,477
Three--

208
00:05:45,477 --> 00:05:47,077
- Two, one. Ta-da!

209
00:05:47,077 --> 00:05:48,027
- [Collin] It's good right?

210
00:05:48,027 --> 00:05:48,922
- [Devan] Yeah dude, looks great.

211
00:05:48,922 --> 00:05:50,622
- [Collin] I hope they vote for me.

212
00:05:50,622 --> 00:05:51,834
- It's like Toad in snow storm.

213
00:05:51,834 --> 00:05:53,417
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

214
00:05:54,345 --> 00:05:57,077
For this round, you challenged us to do Minions.

215
00:05:57,077 --> 00:05:59,193
We have two cupcakes right here,

216
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:00,815
by the way, these are massive cupcakes.

217
00:06:00,815 --> 00:06:02,216
- Bro who eats these?

218
00:06:02,216 --> 00:06:03,661
- And so how we're doing these,

219
00:06:03,661 --> 00:06:06,357
the head is going to go here, the body is going to go here.

220
00:06:06,357 --> 00:06:07,683
And the competition heats up.

221
00:06:07,683 --> 00:06:08,516
Begin.

222
00:06:08,516 --> 00:06:10,136
(chirping)

223
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:11,335
- I don't even know what to do.

224
00:06:11,335 --> 00:06:12,168
(laughing)

225
00:06:12,168 --> 00:06:13,001
- Alright here we go.

226
00:06:13,001 --> 00:06:13,885
Boom, boom, boom, ba boom boom.

227
00:06:13,885 --> 00:06:15,457
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.

228
00:06:15,457 --> 00:06:17,079
Got a lot of energy.

229
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:18,654
Oh.

230
00:06:18,654 --> 00:06:19,487
- What?

231
00:06:19,487 --> 00:06:20,416
- Heck yeah, dude we've got nozzles.

232
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:22,535
If only you had nozzles.

233
00:06:22,535 --> 00:06:23,500
- Why'd you go and do that?

234
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,900
- I broke his nozzles. - I need those.

235
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,514
- Check out this nozzle.

236
00:06:26,514 --> 00:06:28,460
Wow dude, you will be blown away when you see

237
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,943
the functionality on this one.

238
00:06:29,943 --> 00:06:31,352
Oh snap.

239
00:06:31,352 --> 00:06:33,341
Or should I say oh strap.

240
00:06:33,341 --> 00:06:34,930
Get it, 'cause it's his goggle strap.

241
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:35,763
- That's good Collin! - Thank you.

242
00:06:35,763 --> 00:06:36,596
Boom.

243
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:37,429
I think my little Minion is going to have

244
00:06:37,429 --> 00:06:40,753
a blue eye because I have blue eyes.

245
00:06:40,753 --> 00:06:42,201
So might as well give my Minion blue eyes.

246
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:43,034
Wahoo.

247
00:06:45,184 --> 00:06:46,391
Wahoo!

248
00:06:46,391 --> 00:06:47,547
Oh yeah look at that iris.

249
00:06:47,547 --> 00:06:48,380
Oh yeah.

250
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,895
- That's the pupil Collin, not the iris.

251
00:06:49,895 --> 00:06:51,736
- Alright, the thing is, Devan, these are Minions.

252
00:06:51,736 --> 00:06:52,896
They have a different anatomy than

253
00:06:52,896 --> 00:06:54,598
the rest of us, humanoids.

254
00:06:54,598 --> 00:06:55,618
I can't believe I just said humanoids.

255
00:06:55,618 --> 00:06:57,118
Oh that's awesome.

256
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:00,734
(upbeat music)

257
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:04,103
I'm going into super, super focus mode.

258
00:07:04,103 --> 00:07:05,099
- Oh is that what...

259
00:07:05,099 --> 00:07:06,284
Sorry. Sorry.

260
00:07:06,284 --> 00:07:08,014
- No talking. - I won't talk at all.

261
00:07:08,014 --> 00:07:08,879
- You're still talking.

262
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:10,089
- Is it going good?

263
00:07:10,089 --> 00:07:11,334
- I'm focusing. Big.

264
00:07:11,334 --> 00:07:12,167
Got 'em.

265
00:07:12,167 --> 00:07:13,686
- Do you still need me to be quiet because

266
00:07:13,686 --> 00:07:14,679
this is getting old.

267
00:07:14,679 --> 00:07:15,512
- Fine you can be loud.

268
00:07:15,512 --> 00:07:16,643
- Yay!

269
00:07:16,643 --> 00:07:19,208
- Awe it got runny and it juiced.

270
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:20,536
It juiced up my cupcake.

271
00:07:20,536 --> 00:07:21,987
I was focusing and then it juiced.

272
00:07:21,987 --> 00:07:24,153
- Dude, his tooth is like a 3D tooth.

273
00:07:24,153 --> 00:07:25,492
It's just like coming out at you.

274
00:07:25,492 --> 00:07:26,343
It's like--

275
00:07:26,343 --> 00:07:27,176
- Whassup!

276
00:07:27,176 --> 00:07:28,661
- Yeah, it's like "Whassup!"

277
00:07:28,661 --> 00:07:29,775
- It's like banana!

278
00:07:29,775 --> 00:07:31,307
- Bro where did the nozzles go?

279
00:07:31,307 --> 00:07:32,554
- They're mine, you can't have em.

280
00:07:32,554 --> 00:07:33,417
You just have to go find em.

281
00:07:33,417 --> 00:07:34,333
- Fine, I'll get it.

282
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:37,200
This goes against all my codes of honor

283
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,107
- Do we have yellow?

284
00:07:38,107 --> 00:07:38,940
- Nope. No yellow.

285
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,857
- We have orange.

286
00:07:39,857 --> 00:07:40,854
- Yep, only orange.

287
00:07:40,854 --> 00:07:41,720
- Uh oh.

288
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,508
(upbeat music)

289
00:07:43,508 --> 00:07:46,649
- How do you like my color Collin?

290
00:07:46,649 --> 00:07:48,359
- Yeah, how did you get yellow?

291
00:07:48,359 --> 00:07:49,192
- I don't know.

292
00:07:49,192 --> 00:07:50,389
I'm not sure.

293
00:07:50,389 --> 00:07:51,222
- What?

294
00:07:51,222 --> 00:07:54,415
(upbeat music)

295
00:07:54,415 --> 00:07:55,248
Would I be able to win this if

296
00:07:55,248 --> 00:07:57,869
my Minion had a rhinestone overall?

297
00:07:57,869 --> 00:08:00,176
- Bro, how did he come across a rhinestone?

298
00:08:00,176 --> 00:08:02,538
(upbeat music)

299
00:08:02,538 --> 00:08:03,648
Oh no!

300
00:08:03,648 --> 00:08:05,895
- My tracing skills are awesome.

301
00:08:05,895 --> 00:08:07,202
Woo!

302
00:08:07,202 --> 00:08:08,970
I shouldn't be screaming so loud about my tracing skills.

303
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:10,075
They're getting pretty bad.

304
00:08:10,075 --> 00:08:11,289
My hands are getting a little bit jittery.

305
00:08:11,289 --> 00:08:12,907
And it's coming through in my masterpiece.

306
00:08:12,907 --> 00:08:14,481
Maybe my guy's a little bit frilly.

307
00:08:14,481 --> 00:08:15,354
- He's what?

308
00:08:15,354 --> 00:08:17,020
- He got frills. - He got frills.

309
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:17,853
- And grills.

310
00:08:17,853 --> 00:08:19,413
(screaming)

311
00:08:19,413 --> 00:08:22,087
So right now, it's time for my favorite part, embellishments

312
00:08:22,087 --> 00:08:23,488
Oh snap.

313
00:08:23,488 --> 00:08:25,314
- Dude, your guy's blinged out.

314
00:08:25,314 --> 00:08:28,130
- Yo, yo, yo he's got pink diamonds in his grill.

315
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:29,029
Woo!

316
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:31,019
Yo dude, my guy's going to be so next level.

317
00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:32,020
You know what his name is?

318
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,684
- No idea.

319
00:08:33,684 --> 00:08:34,517
- Bob.

320
00:08:34,517 --> 00:08:36,640
Get a little bit of pink diamond, very rare.

321
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,637
Perfect.

322
00:08:37,637 --> 00:08:39,184
- Alright, it is almost done.

323
00:08:39,184 --> 00:08:40,756
I just have to add the yellow to his face.

324
00:08:40,756 --> 00:08:42,078
- I don't understand how he got his lines so good.

325
00:08:42,078 --> 00:08:45,302
I mean, his looks like a Minion and mine looks like noodles.

326
00:08:45,302 --> 00:08:46,717
Here we go, the big reveal.

327
00:08:46,717 --> 00:08:47,550
Three--

328
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,609
- Two, one. Ta-da!

329
00:08:49,609 --> 00:08:51,169
- Alright, now you guys get to comment down below,

330
00:08:51,169 --> 00:08:52,715
who won this round.

331
00:08:52,715 --> 00:08:55,363
Is it my bedazzled Bob Minion or ...

332
00:08:55,363 --> 00:08:56,838
- My traditional Minion.

333
00:08:56,838 --> 00:08:57,702
- Basic!

334
00:08:57,702 --> 00:09:00,859
- Awesome abilities, like no arms.

335
00:09:00,859 --> 00:09:03,479
- There's going to be another 90 second lighting round

336
00:09:03,479 --> 00:09:05,600
because we're making Spider-Man which you guys suggested.

337
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,598
Ready and begin.

338
00:09:06,598 --> 00:09:07,878
- Oh wait. Now...

339
00:09:07,878 --> 00:09:10,045
- Time to make Spooder-Man

340
00:09:11,637 --> 00:09:13,997
Man, Spooder-Man, you've got to work with me bro.

341
00:09:13,997 --> 00:09:17,830
- Dude, this red is not coming out fast enough

342
00:09:20,418 --> 00:09:21,786
- We have 50 seconds!

343
00:09:21,786 --> 00:09:23,234
- No, okay, I need a knife.

344
00:09:23,234 --> 00:09:24,067
- I need a knife.

345
00:09:24,067 --> 00:09:24,900
- No, why?

346
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,900
Okay I'm using scissors.

347
00:09:29,441 --> 00:09:32,858
- Holy cow I've got like 20 seconds left.

348
00:09:34,247 --> 00:09:35,613
- Why were you using that?

349
00:09:35,613 --> 00:09:36,982
Wait where's white?

350
00:09:36,982 --> 00:09:37,980
I need white.

351
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,936
- And three, two, one.

352
00:09:39,936 --> 00:09:40,974
Done.

353
00:09:40,974 --> 00:09:43,149
This looks just like Spider-Man from the new Avengers movie.

354
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:45,160
What happened to the front of yours?

355
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,522
- I was trying to do the eyes.

356
00:09:46,522 --> 00:09:47,355
It just wouldn't come out.

357
00:09:47,355 --> 00:09:48,642
- You guys got to comment down below,

358
00:09:48,642 --> 00:09:51,161
who won the Spider-Man lighting round.

359
00:09:51,161 --> 00:09:53,202
And we're coming down to the finale right now.

360
00:09:53,202 --> 00:09:56,046
So let's go and let's get saucy.

361
00:09:56,046 --> 00:09:57,051
For this round,

362
00:09:57,051 --> 00:09:59,255
you challenged us to do a character from Star Wars.

363
00:09:59,255 --> 00:10:01,334
- Oh I can do BB-8 from the Last Jedi

364
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:02,671
- That's the easy way though

365
00:10:02,671 --> 00:10:03,960
- Bro how is it easier though?

366
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,879
- Just watch.

367
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:06,737
You shall see.

368
00:10:06,737 --> 00:10:08,403
Or see you shall.

369
00:10:08,403 --> 00:10:09,667
- So you're doing Yoda

370
00:10:09,667 --> 00:10:10,500
(laughing)

371
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,333
- We'll see.

372
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:12,399
- Alright, wait I need a knife.

373
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,388
I'll be right back.

374
00:10:13,388 --> 00:10:16,075
Very slowly, walking with a knife.

375
00:10:16,075 --> 00:10:17,230
- Safety's important.

376
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,063
- Yes.

377
00:10:18,063 --> 00:10:20,671
I am going to cut a small piece into my cupcake.

378
00:10:20,671 --> 00:10:24,634
That way BB-8's head can fit on his body.

379
00:10:24,634 --> 00:10:25,467
There we go. Nice.

380
00:10:25,467 --> 00:10:26,300
That actually looks really good.

381
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,580
Nice.

382
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,850
I have to say, this is definitely more difficult

383
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:31,267
than the pancake art challenge.

384
00:10:31,267 --> 00:10:32,517
- Way more difficult.

385
00:10:32,517 --> 00:10:33,849
Man, this is going to be hard.

386
00:10:33,849 --> 00:10:34,933
I have to now like cover it up.

387
00:10:34,933 --> 00:10:35,766
Oh this is going to be difficult.

388
00:10:35,766 --> 00:10:37,204
- Nothing I can't handle.

389
00:10:37,204 --> 00:10:40,414
(upbeat music)

390
00:10:40,414 --> 00:10:42,595
The black from like the mouth and eyes are mixing into it.

391
00:10:42,595 --> 00:10:44,001
Now he's looking like a garbage truck.

392
00:10:44,001 --> 00:10:45,536
But you know what, it was worth a shot.

393
00:10:45,536 --> 00:10:47,434
You're gone Yoda, I'm taking you off my pancake.

394
00:10:47,434 --> 00:10:48,892
I'm banishing you...

395
00:10:48,892 --> 00:10:49,931
cupcake.

396
00:10:49,931 --> 00:10:51,972
Why do both have to have the word cake in it, man.

397
00:10:51,972 --> 00:10:53,088
It's a clean slate.

398
00:10:53,088 --> 00:10:54,090
Alright here we go.

399
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,537
A big scoop a doop.

400
00:10:55,537 --> 00:10:56,691
Oh.

401
00:10:56,691 --> 00:10:57,846
- I'll take it.

402
00:10:57,846 --> 00:10:58,916
I need more more on mine.

403
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:00,365
Dude, I get that you're starting over,

404
00:11:00,365 --> 00:11:02,235
but why are you putting white on there?

405
00:11:02,235 --> 00:11:03,068
He's green.

406
00:11:03,068 --> 00:11:03,901
- It's part of a master plan.

407
00:11:03,901 --> 00:11:05,460
One you simply wouldn't understand

408
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,204
because you're not a Jedi Master like I am.

409
00:11:07,204 --> 00:11:08,076
- What?

410
00:11:08,076 --> 00:11:11,106
(upbeat music)

411
00:11:11,106 --> 00:11:12,100
- There we go.

412
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,224
Alright, let's get some extra Goosiness on there.

413
00:11:13,224 --> 00:11:14,666
- Get some extra whatiness on there?

414
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:15,499
- Goosiness.

415
00:11:15,499 --> 00:11:16,745
Time to go in for details.

416
00:11:16,745 --> 00:11:20,246
I'm talking the mouth, the eyes, the whole nine yards.

417
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:21,079
Boom.

418
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:21,912
Completed.

419
00:11:21,912 --> 00:11:23,192
Why didn't I think of using the cupcake

420
00:11:23,192 --> 00:11:24,056
in that way?

421
00:11:24,056 --> 00:11:25,302
Mine's just like a puny little body

422
00:11:25,302 --> 00:11:26,424
with a massive head.

423
00:11:26,424 --> 00:11:27,917
And yours actually looks like BB-8.

424
00:11:27,917 --> 00:11:29,163
I'm definitely not going to become a Jedi Knight after this.

425
00:11:29,163 --> 00:11:30,076
That is for sure.

426
00:11:30,076 --> 00:11:31,985
I mean Kylo Ren's going to come looking for me soon.

427
00:11:31,985 --> 00:11:32,890
- Here we go!

428
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:33,723
- The reveal.

429
00:11:33,723 --> 00:11:35,531
- Three, two, one. - Three, two, one.

430
00:11:35,531 --> 00:11:36,364
- Ta-da! - Ta-da!

431
00:11:36,364 --> 00:11:40,098
- I think I definitely didn't win this round 'cause my

432
00:11:40,098 --> 00:11:42,578
Yoda doesn't look anywhere near as good as your BB-8.

433
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:45,267
So guys, right now we are on to the finale.

434
00:11:45,267 --> 00:11:48,151
But first, comment down below who won this round

435
00:11:48,151 --> 00:11:50,050
and then we're going to be able to eat all these

436
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,090
different cupcakes.

437
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:51,923
That looks delicious.

438
00:11:51,923 --> 00:11:52,756
- I can't wait.

439
00:11:52,756 --> 00:11:54,763
- For the final round, the one it all comes down to.

440
00:11:54,763 --> 00:11:55,874
It's a freestyle.

441
00:11:55,874 --> 00:11:56,871
We get to make whatever we want,

442
00:11:56,871 --> 00:11:58,771
as fast as we possibly can.

443
00:11:58,771 --> 00:12:00,013
We're going to be able to eat

444
00:12:00,013 --> 00:12:03,144
this masterpiece, and all of the other cupcakes, very soon.

445
00:12:03,144 --> 00:12:04,106
And begin.

446
00:12:04,106 --> 00:12:06,060
This one's gonna get a little messy.

447
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,932
This one's not only going to be a cupcake masterpiece,

448
00:12:07,932 --> 00:12:10,214
but an architectural masterpiece as well.

449
00:12:10,214 --> 00:12:11,998
- So we have these toothpicks to help us out here.

450
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:14,220
- This feels like cheating but I'll take it.

451
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,100
Because I need a cheat to win this round.

452
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,721
The main tactic just comes down to

453
00:12:17,721 --> 00:12:19,792
an exorbitant amount of frosting.

454
00:12:19,792 --> 00:12:20,709
Here we go.

455
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,117
Ta-da, skewer it, boom, there we go.

456
00:12:24,117 --> 00:12:24,950
Boom.

457
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,867
Yo this is the most amount of frosting I have ever seen,

458
00:12:26,867 --> 00:12:28,654
or used in my entire life at once.

459
00:12:28,654 --> 00:12:31,646
You gotta impale it, here, to make sure it all stays upright

460
00:12:31,646 --> 00:12:32,581
There we go.

461
00:12:32,581 --> 00:12:33,825
Now the base of it is going

462
00:12:33,825 --> 00:12:35,065
to be a little bit difficult.

463
00:12:35,065 --> 00:12:36,716
Luckily for me, my whole strat

464
00:12:36,716 --> 00:12:39,022
is making the Leaning Tower of Pisa.

465
00:12:39,022 --> 00:12:42,061
This is going to be very difficult to keep this aloft.

466
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:43,649
- Wait, bro, how are you going to eat that?

467
00:12:43,649 --> 00:12:45,717
I just realized, mine has a bunch of these twig,

468
00:12:45,717 --> 00:12:47,843
stick things in there, and I'm going to be biting on these.

469
00:12:47,843 --> 00:12:49,548
- This is either going to be the greatest

470
00:12:49,548 --> 00:12:52,798
Leaning Tower of Pisa, or a giant worm.

471
00:12:54,035 --> 00:12:55,108
It's definitely leaning.

472
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:56,384
It's getting a little bit warped.

473
00:12:56,384 --> 00:12:57,631
Alright, there we go.

474
00:12:57,631 --> 00:12:58,464
Boom. Stick it.

475
00:12:58,464 --> 00:13:00,552
Oh my gosh, it's like starting to break from the inside.

476
00:13:00,552 --> 00:13:01,919
I only have one more.

477
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:02,752
Please.

478
00:13:04,324 --> 00:13:06,290
Alright here we go, the ultimate test.

479
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:09,277
Will the Leaning Tower of Pisa stay aloft.

480
00:13:09,277 --> 00:13:10,110
What do you think Devan.

481
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,084
- Nope.

482
00:13:11,084 --> 00:13:12,112
- Let's see how many seconds it stays up for.

483
00:13:12,112 --> 00:13:13,445
Three, two, one.

484
00:13:14,308 --> 00:13:15,550
- One.

485
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:16,821
(laughing)

486
00:13:16,821 --> 00:13:19,181
- Ow, oh my gosh, there's little spikes on it.

487
00:13:19,181 --> 00:13:20,014
- Yeah.

488
00:13:20,014 --> 00:13:20,847
- I'm out of things to do with it.

489
00:13:20,847 --> 00:13:21,832
It's a shish kabob.

490
00:13:21,832 --> 00:13:23,586
I'm just going to make the ultimate cupcake

491
00:13:23,586 --> 00:13:24,587
thing of all time.

492
00:13:24,587 --> 00:13:25,712
We've got the frosting.

493
00:13:25,712 --> 00:13:26,756
There we go, oh first,

494
00:13:26,756 --> 00:13:28,037
you gotta first spread you're frosting

495
00:13:28,037 --> 00:13:29,158
- [Devon] Whoa, whoa!

496
00:13:29,158 --> 00:13:30,477
- Get those sparkles going and

497
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:31,799
some good old blue sugar on there.

498
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:32,887
Does it look like I have my life together right now.

499
00:13:32,887 --> 00:13:34,429
The answer is absolutely.

500
00:13:34,429 --> 00:13:36,508
I'm making the awesomest pancake in the world.

501
00:13:36,508 --> 00:13:37,759
- It's not a pancake.

502
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:38,839
It's a cupcake.

503
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:40,189
- Ah I keep forgetting.

504
00:13:40,189 --> 00:13:41,184
Attack.

505
00:13:41,184 --> 00:13:42,017
- What.

506
00:13:42,017 --> 00:13:43,149
Bro what are you doing?

507
00:13:43,149 --> 00:13:44,464
- Dude, I just got so bored man,

508
00:13:44,464 --> 00:13:45,407
that wasn't going fast enough.

509
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:47,379
So you guys get to comment down below who won

510
00:13:47,379 --> 00:13:48,694
the challenge overall.

511
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:49,768
And right now,

512
00:13:49,768 --> 00:13:51,548
time for us to eat some cupcakes.

513
00:13:51,548 --> 00:13:53,580
But not these, the nice, pretty looking ones.

514
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,710
So we've got all of our cupcakes right here.

515
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,566
And we're going to be eating all the way around

516
00:13:57,566 --> 00:13:59,801
the perimeter and ending with our unicorns.

517
00:13:59,801 --> 00:14:01,425
I don't want to have to eat Freckles.

518
00:14:01,425 --> 00:14:02,338
I feel so bad.

519
00:14:02,338 --> 00:14:03,376
Let's kick it off right now

520
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:04,501
- Poop emoji, poop!

521
00:14:04,501 --> 00:14:05,539
- So there's paper around mine.

522
00:14:05,539 --> 00:14:06,818
Gotta get that paper off.

523
00:14:06,818 --> 00:14:07,891
Ain't no time for you're paper.

524
00:14:07,891 --> 00:14:09,097
- And I have the paper off.

525
00:14:09,097 --> 00:14:11,848
- Oh no no no, okay here we go.

526
00:14:11,848 --> 00:14:13,699
Holy cow there's like 12 eyes.

527
00:14:13,699 --> 00:14:14,537
- I think you're going to end up with some

528
00:14:14,537 --> 00:14:15,871
brown around your mouth.

529
00:14:15,871 --> 00:14:16,738
Cheers.

530
00:14:16,738 --> 00:14:18,291
- Don't touch my poop with your poop.

531
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,331
That's not sanitary.

532
00:14:19,331 --> 00:14:20,575
- I did it again.

533
00:14:20,575 --> 00:14:21,408
It's okay.

534
00:14:21,408 --> 00:14:23,908
- Here we go, three, two, one.

535
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:27,582
- Holy cow.

536
00:14:27,582 --> 00:14:30,056
Next up Devan, let's try our mushrooms.

537
00:14:30,056 --> 00:14:31,425
Oh my gosh.

538
00:14:31,425 --> 00:14:32,580
- Oh yeah

539
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,759
- Oh man, oh I just spilt my sparkles.

540
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:34,592
- Oh no!

541
00:14:34,592 --> 00:14:35,425
- This one's super messy.

542
00:14:35,425 --> 00:14:36,264
Ready!

543
00:14:36,264 --> 00:14:37,097
- Yeah, I'm ready!

544
00:14:37,097 --> 00:14:39,180
- [Both] Three, two, one.

545
00:14:40,788 --> 00:14:42,038
- Bro, so good.

546
00:14:43,309 --> 00:14:45,095
- That's the best thing ever.

547
00:14:45,095 --> 00:14:46,371
Next up we're going for Star Wars.

548
00:14:46,371 --> 00:14:47,855
Alright, here's my guy.

549
00:14:47,855 --> 00:14:49,134
Yoda's body.

550
00:14:49,134 --> 00:14:50,328
- Bro, how am I going to, wait.

551
00:14:50,328 --> 00:14:51,276
You already did it?

552
00:14:51,276 --> 00:14:53,968
Yo look, I'm going to try to put the head back on

553
00:14:53,968 --> 00:14:56,499
- Alright and I'm gonna take a giant bite of Yoda's head.

554
00:14:56,499 --> 00:14:57,780
He tastes good he does.

555
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,058
Good tastes he does.

556
00:14:59,058 --> 00:15:00,138
That makes no sense.

557
00:15:00,138 --> 00:15:00,971
- Look at that bro.

558
00:15:00,971 --> 00:15:01,804
You ready?

559
00:15:01,804 --> 00:15:03,304
- Three, two, one.

560
00:15:04,935 --> 00:15:07,736
(mumbling)

561
00:15:07,736 --> 00:15:09,344
- Dude Yoda was disgusting.

562
00:15:09,344 --> 00:15:10,796
That thing tastes like a thousand years old.

563
00:15:10,796 --> 00:15:11,629
- What!

564
00:15:11,629 --> 00:15:12,800
- But it just tasted old and crusty.

565
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,955
Spider-Man is next.

566
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:14,947
Oh my gosh.

567
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:16,146
- This isn't even Spider-Man.

568
00:15:16,146 --> 00:15:17,010
I don't know what you call this.

569
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:17,843
- This looks really good.

570
00:15:17,843 --> 00:15:19,500
Its got little like marshmallow type things on top.

571
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,368
Here we go.

572
00:15:20,368 --> 00:15:21,868
- Three, two, one.

573
00:15:24,185 --> 00:15:25,188
- So good.

574
00:15:25,188 --> 00:15:26,179
- Boom.

575
00:15:26,179 --> 00:15:28,841
And now, time to eat the unicorn.

576
00:15:28,841 --> 00:15:29,674
But first,

577
00:15:29,674 --> 00:15:31,384
comment down below, what are some other things you would

578
00:15:31,384 --> 00:15:33,573
love to see us turn into cupcake art.

579
00:15:33,573 --> 00:15:35,667
We're going to start right now with the snout.

580
00:15:35,667 --> 00:15:37,453
Yo, take it and dip it in my freckles.

581
00:15:37,453 --> 00:15:38,737
- Wait I wanna dip it!

582
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:39,570
- Stop.

583
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:40,903
Three, two, one.

584
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:44,487
- The pink, so good.

585
00:15:44,487 --> 00:15:45,320
Holy cow!

586
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,645
I have to get all of Freckles letters all into

587
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:47,685
one cupcake right now.

588
00:15:47,685 --> 00:15:49,222
And this is the final cupcake.

589
00:15:49,222 --> 00:15:50,759
- Bro, I wanna try some of that.

590
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:51,592
- Alright, go for it.

591
00:15:51,592 --> 00:15:52,829
Three, two, oh by the way,

592
00:15:52,829 --> 00:15:54,016
five, technically

593
00:15:54,016 --> 00:15:56,815
- [Both] Five, four, three, two, one.

594
00:15:56,815 --> 00:15:57,648
Done.

595
00:15:57,648 --> 00:16:00,186
- Love you guys! - Bye.

596
00:16:00,186 --> 00:16:01,671
Oh so good.

597
00:16:01,671 --> 00:16:03,338
I need more of that.

598
00:16:06,236 --> 00:16:07,236
- [Both] Bye
