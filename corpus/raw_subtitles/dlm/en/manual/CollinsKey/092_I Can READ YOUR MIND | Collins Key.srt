00:00:00,279 --> 00:00:01,428
- What's up, it's Collins Key

2
00:00:01,428 --> 00:00:04,090
and today I'm going to attempt to read your mind.

3
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:06,098
I have five cards right here.

4
00:00:06,098 --> 00:00:08,269
Now I want you to take a look at these cards.

5
00:00:08,269 --> 00:00:11,697
I want you to pick one card and memorize it.

6
00:00:11,697 --> 00:00:13,018
Keep repeating the name of your card

7
00:00:13,018 --> 00:00:15,488
over and over and over in your mind.

8
00:00:15,488 --> 00:00:16,600
You got it?

9
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,068
Perfect.

10
00:00:18,068 --> 00:00:19,099
I'm just gonna mix them up right now

11
00:00:19,099 --> 00:00:21,728
and as I mix these cards up, again just keep repeating

12
00:00:21,728 --> 00:00:25,928
the name of your card over and over in your mind.

13
00:00:25,928 --> 00:00:26,761
Awesome.

14
00:00:27,908 --> 00:00:30,868
And right now I want you to look into my eyes

15
00:00:30,868 --> 00:00:35,035
and I want you to imagine sending me the name of your card.

16
00:00:37,387 --> 00:00:38,220
(snap)

17
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:39,558
Got it

18
00:00:39,558 --> 00:00:41,141
You are thinking of

19
00:00:42,906 --> 00:00:44,656
this card right here.

20
00:00:46,408 --> 00:00:48,947
So hopefully I got this right.

21
00:00:48,947 --> 00:00:50,149
Keep repeating the name of your card

22
00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:52,369
over and over in your mind

23
00:00:52,369 --> 00:00:53,658
and hopefully I was able to read your mind

24
00:00:53,658 --> 00:00:56,659
and remove the one card you were thinking of.

25
00:00:56,659 --> 00:00:58,619
Now if this worked, I don't know please let me know

26
00:00:58,619 --> 00:01:00,888
by giving this video a big thumbs up

27
00:01:00,888 --> 00:01:02,990
and also share this video with all of your friends

28
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:05,387
to see if I can read their minds as well.

29
00:01:05,387 --> 00:01:06,748
