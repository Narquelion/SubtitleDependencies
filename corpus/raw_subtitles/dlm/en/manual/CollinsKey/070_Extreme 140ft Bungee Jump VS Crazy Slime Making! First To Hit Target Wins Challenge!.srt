1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,990
- I am over 140 feet in the air right now

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:04,147
because Elmer's asked us,

3
00:00:04,147 --> 00:00:06,680
"What if we made slime in the most extreme conditions?"

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,539
So you challenged us to make slime upside down,

5
00:00:08,539 --> 00:00:11,850
in an earthquake simulator, and a 140 foot bungee jump!

6
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,450
So right now, let's take the leap.

7
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:14,283
Here we go!

8
00:00:14,283 --> 00:00:16,270
This is the jump.

9
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:18,060
Bro, my heart is beating so fast.

10
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:18,893
All right, here we go.

11
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:20,984
Three, two, one!

12
00:00:20,984 --> 00:00:21,940
(screams)

13
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:22,850
Got all the glue, - Yes

14
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,020
- And now it's time to make the slime

15
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:24,930
that we are gonna be using

16
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,446
when we go off of the bungee jump drop.

17
00:00:26,446 --> 00:00:28,570
That is a whole bunch!

18
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:29,403
Of course, there's gonna be a whole bunch

19
00:00:29,403 --> 00:00:30,394
of different approaches that we have.

20
00:00:30,394 --> 00:00:31,227
- Yes.

21
00:00:31,227 --> 00:00:32,233
- I have a couple of specific slimes in mind..

22
00:00:32,233 --> 00:00:33,270
that I think are gonna be perfect,

23
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,180
get the perfect stretch.

24
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,930
- I'm honestly already very nervous for this jump!

25
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,880
My slime is probably gonna be way cooler

26
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,960
than your slime. Just sayin'.

27
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,793
- What?

28
00:00:40,793 --> 00:00:41,927
- I think it's gonna reflect in the light and everything

29
00:00:41,927 --> 00:00:43,680
- What?! - as I'm like falling and

30
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,870
plunging towards the earth.

31
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:45,911
- All right well here we go.

32
00:00:45,911 --> 00:00:47,560
You add that in, I'll keep adding in mine over here.

33
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,090
- I think I might've added too much glue.

34
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:49,923
Do you need some glue?

35
00:00:49,923 --> 00:00:50,756
- Um. No...

36
00:00:50,756 --> 00:00:51,630
(talking over each other)

37
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:52,463
- Whoa whoa whoa

38
00:00:52,463 --> 00:00:53,296
- Do you need this here?

39
00:00:53,296 --> 00:00:54,129
- Hey, hey, hey this is my magical liquid, Devan.

40
00:00:54,129 --> 00:00:55,320
You can not have this stuff.

41
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,290
- Fine. I will stay with my very special

42
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:58,850
metallic magical activator here.

43
00:00:58,850 --> 00:00:59,683
- Wait, can I have that?

44
00:00:59,683 --> 00:01:00,892
- No, no it's mine.

45
00:01:00,892 --> 00:01:03,030
This is actually a super new, cool,

46
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,360
metallic, magical liquid.

47
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,370
Your slime is not gonna stand up to mine at all.

48
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:07,203
- I don't believe you.

49
00:01:07,203 --> 00:01:08,200
Okay, here we go, it's time to mix it up,

50
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,033
we've got the net of glory over here.

51
00:01:09,033 --> 00:01:10,218
Let's just pop this in here like this.

52
00:01:10,218 --> 00:01:12,368
- Yes, that's looking great.

53
00:01:12,368 --> 00:01:14,892
- Oh man, alright, well that's enough with the net.

54
00:01:14,892 --> 00:01:16,120
I hope that's not a foreshadowing

55
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,400
of what's gonna happen with the bungee cord

56
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,227
'cause that's not very good right there, so here we go.

57
00:01:19,227 --> 00:01:21,472
- Oh, I think I added way too much glue, dude.

58
00:01:21,472 --> 00:01:23,190
I forgot that we're making two of these.

59
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:24,240
- Yeah, we're making two slimes

60
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,460
'cause we're gonna be mixing them midair,

61
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,590
and then depositing them down

62
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:27,980
into the "what if" Elmer's bucket.

63
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,380
- You know what, I think I'm gonna use some of this glue

64
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,980
for my next slime here, so I'm just gonna

65
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:32,370
transfer the buckets.

66
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:33,946
- Oh you're gonna add like different magical liquid into it?

67
00:01:33,946 --> 00:01:36,830
- Yeah, exactly Dude, this looks awesome!

68
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,440
- For a second, I thought you were a superhero there, man.

69
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,660
Your hands turned all metallic, and I thought

70
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,810
that your whole body was gonna turn metallic

71
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:41,922
or something man.

72
00:01:41,922 --> 00:01:42,755
(metallic whoosh)

73
00:01:42,755 --> 00:01:43,588
- Yup, I made my own sound effects.

74
00:01:43,588 --> 00:01:44,421
- What? I think this is gonna be

75
00:01:44,421 --> 00:01:45,900
the winning color right here, for sure.

76
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,691
I mean you can just see, it's obscuring Devan,

77
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:48,930
and that's how good it is.

78
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:50,740
Whoa, first bottle down.

79
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:54,010
- Dude, look at my slime, it worked out so good!

80
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:55,380
- As you know it has to be Collins-proof,

81
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,020
that means it has to be able to make it through anything,

82
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,343
so right now it's the make it through anything test,

83
00:01:58,343 --> 00:02:00,103
so here we go.

84
00:02:00,103 --> 00:02:01,490
(slime jiggles)

85
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:03,082
- I hope I make it through this test, jeez!

86
00:02:03,082 --> 00:02:03,915
Got it in my slime.

87
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,880
- It made it through, alright yeah this is definitely

88
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,160
bungee jump ready, so here we go.

89
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,650
- Now I got some holographic powder I'm gonna add in.

90
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:10,831
- [Collins] That's gonna get everywhere.

91
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:12,190
When you're falling, bro, there's gonna be

92
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,717
so much light hitting it, it's gonna look insane.

93
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:15,261
- I know it's probably gonna be the coolest slime

94
00:02:15,261 --> 00:02:16,160
I've ever made.

95
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,909
- You can hold my bowl, I want to do a practice round

96
00:02:17,909 --> 00:02:19,640
for when we actually go for the bungee jump,

97
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,500
and I gotta make it into it.

98
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,657
If I miss, please move. Alright you ready?

99
00:02:21,657 --> 00:02:24,310
- [Together] Three, two, one.

100
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,401
- Like that. And then, you got this.

101
00:02:25,401 --> 00:02:26,475
- Here we go, here we go.

102
00:02:26,475 --> 00:02:27,308
(dramatic music beat)

103
00:02:27,308 --> 00:02:28,551
- Devan! Devan, you missed!

104
00:02:28,551 --> 00:02:30,260
- Oh! Are you kidding me? What, you said please move.

105
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,846
- I meant like move to catch it.

106
00:02:31,846 --> 00:02:35,313
- Oh, oh that's what you meant, I'm sorry, my bad.

107
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,638
Just do it one more time and I got you.

108
00:02:37,638 --> 00:02:38,471
- Unbelievable, pinky promise

109
00:02:38,471 --> 00:02:39,510
you're gonna actually catch it, okay?

110
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,662
- [Together] Three, two, one

111
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:43,798
(guys yelling)

112
00:02:43,798 --> 00:02:44,799
(dramatic music beat)

113
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:46,470
- Are you kidding me?

114
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,857
- That had so much force to it.

115
00:02:47,857 --> 00:02:50,630
Do not try this at home, this is not safe yet.

116
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,203
- All I gotta say is, if that's any indication

117
00:02:52,203 --> 00:02:54,360
of the force that my slime will be coming down with,

118
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,490
it may shatter the Elmer's "what if" bucket.

119
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:58,230
Click over here to vote right now if you think

120
00:02:58,230 --> 00:02:59,063
that's what's gonna happen.

121
00:02:59,063 --> 00:03:00,430
And let's make the next slime!

122
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,838
- Now if you thought my first slime was cool,

123
00:03:01,838 --> 00:03:03,930
this slime is gonna be even better.

124
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:06,093
- Not to flex, Devan, I've got color changing slime bro,

125
00:03:06,093 --> 00:03:07,375
with this glue right here.

126
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:08,208
- Oh yeah, you do?

127
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:10,040
And as you can tell, we've got these watermelons over here,

128
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,120
and here's my idea:

129
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,180
I wanna test how high

130
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,036
that bungee jump is by yeeting these watermelons

131
00:03:14,036 --> 00:03:15,690
off of the top of it.

132
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,170
Alright so right now let's go test these out.

133
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,003
Oh my gosh.

134
00:03:18,003 --> 00:03:19,626
- Dude, just you getting harnessed is making me nervous.

135
00:03:19,626 --> 00:03:22,760
- Holy cow, okay so they got the giant cord now.

136
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,540
All right, this is getting

137
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,576
realer and realer by the second.

138
00:03:25,576 --> 00:03:27,376
- I can confirm, it has been clicked in,

139
00:03:27,376 --> 00:03:28,863
and it's screwed on.

140
00:03:28,863 --> 00:03:30,130
It's looking good.

141
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:30,990
- I can't see it though.

142
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:31,823
He did one of these on it.

143
00:03:31,823 --> 00:03:32,990
- I hope this isn't a prank video.

144
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:33,823
You promise it's not a prank video?

145
00:03:33,823 --> 00:03:34,990
- I promise this is not a prank video.

146
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:35,960
- Okay, that would not be good.

147
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,210
- I promise you.

148
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:38,420
- Alright, yup, secure.

149
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,380
- That didn't seem like you checked,

150
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,213
you barely touched it!

151
00:03:40,213 --> 00:03:41,080
- He checked it first!

152
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,053
- Okay but bro come on.

153
00:03:42,053 --> 00:03:43,030
(Devan and Collins talking over each other)

154
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,110
- You like barely touched it.

155
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:45,905
- We've got watermelon number one

156
00:03:45,905 --> 00:03:47,604
And watermelon number two.

157
00:03:47,604 --> 00:03:49,190
We've got wo friendly watermelons,

158
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,480
as you guys know we love watermelons.

159
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,670
We've definitely smashed a lot of them,

160
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:53,352
so let's do something we've never done.

161
00:03:53,352 --> 00:03:54,520
- And today we smash some more!

162
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,353
- Exactly!

163
00:03:55,353 --> 00:03:56,410
- Initial predictions, Devan,

164
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:57,800
how far do you think the watermelon's gonna splat?

165
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,180
- I think it's gonna go all the way to the outer ring.

166
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,130
- Alright so here we go, this is happening.

167
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:03,963
- This is getting real.

168
00:04:03,963 --> 00:04:04,954
- Hello. Alright so let's see, all right.

169
00:04:04,954 --> 00:04:07,570
- I have to say, this is where I'm happy

170
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:08,560
to be the younger brother.

171
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,190
- I knew it was a cage, but I gotta say,

172
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,680
it's definitely a lot wobblier than I thought it would be,

173
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,250
especially with two watermelons, man.

174
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,642
- We're going up, man.

175
00:04:15,642 --> 00:04:16,710
- Oh man.

176
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:19,390
- Dude, it's definitely getting real now,

177
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,251
'cause we just, yeah, are ascending.

178
00:04:21,251 --> 00:04:24,670
This feels like a ride you'd find in an amusement park, man.

179
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:27,607
I can like see all of LA out here. Holy cow.

180
00:04:27,607 --> 00:04:28,610
- Can you hear me?

181
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,633
- Yes, and you're gonna want to move back when I drop these.

182
00:04:30,633 --> 00:04:32,570
- I couldn't hear him at all.

183
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:33,520
- I thought I was prepared for this.

184
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,060
Fam, I don't know if I'm prepared for this.

185
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,796
Yeah, this may be one of the scariest things

186
00:04:38,796 --> 00:04:40,144
I have ever been a part of.

187
00:04:40,144 --> 00:04:43,030
This is like, so nerve-wracking.

188
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,330
Like, if you just look up, it's just a crane!

189
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:46,450
- Oh my gosh, I'm like lowkey

190
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:47,400
starting to shake a little bit.

191
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,290
Don't tell Devan, though, shh, we can not tell Devan,

192
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,650
I gotta be brave big brother, okay?

193
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,041
- Collins, can you hear me?

194
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,793
I see a hand waving, but I think that's Ron's hand.

195
00:04:54,793 --> 00:04:55,991
I don't think he can hear me.

196
00:04:55,991 --> 00:04:58,058
- I'm starting to shake. Devan's gonna freak out, bro.

197
00:04:58,058 --> 00:04:59,810
Cause here's the advantage that Devan has, bro.

198
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:01,840
I'm the older brother so he gets to see me do it first.

199
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,160
- Collins, I'm gonna step out.

200
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,392
- I've got the watermelons, so let's see how this goes, man.

201
00:05:05,392 --> 00:05:06,567
Ready? Here we go, hold it over like this.

202
00:05:06,567 --> 00:05:09,252
Alright here we go, three, two, one.

203
00:05:09,252 --> 00:05:11,585
- Oh man, it's coming down.

204
00:05:11,585 --> 00:05:13,032
(watermelon splats)

205
00:05:13,032 --> 00:05:13,865
(guys yelling)

206
00:05:13,865 --> 00:05:16,100
- Oh my god!

207
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,680
- What? Did you see that??

208
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,704
It like touched that building and that building

209
00:05:19,704 --> 00:05:20,760
and that building.

210
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,593
Oh my gosh

211
00:05:21,593 --> 00:05:23,680
- Did you see that? I saw that.

212
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,070
- Are you going for another one?

213
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,440
- Alright, guys, I've got the second watermelon

214
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,273
'cause I gotta test this.

215
00:05:27,273 --> 00:05:28,510
This is scientific method.

216
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,550
We've gotta see if it's really that big of a drop.

217
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:34,150
Let's see. Three, two, one, yeet.

218
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,741
- [Devan] Oh, it's off. Here we go!

219
00:05:35,741 --> 00:05:36,884
(watermelons splats)

220
00:05:36,884 --> 00:05:37,717
(guys cheering)

221
00:05:37,717 --> 00:05:38,578
- [Devan] Oh, dude!

222
00:05:38,578 --> 00:05:40,220
Alright, we've gotta go back down there, get my slimes,

223
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,053
and oh my gosh.

224
00:05:41,053 --> 00:05:43,397
- Are you kidding me? There's no watermelon left!

225
00:05:43,397 --> 00:05:45,800
- My heart's beating so fast right now.

226
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,540
- Ohh, man, I'm real nervous.

227
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:50,120
Dude that went literally everywhere.

228
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,387
- [Collins] I thought the impact would be big, I gotta say,

229
00:05:52,387 --> 00:05:54,510
and now being up there for the first time,

230
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,461
very nerve-wracking, Devan.

231
00:05:55,461 --> 00:05:57,940
This space feels pretty large, when you're up there,

232
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,772
it's like this little tiny hole, you have to jump,

233
00:05:59,772 --> 00:06:01,160
like pencil dive into.

234
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,160
- Oh man.

235
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,720
- So let's keep making the slime, but I gotta say

236
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,620
that I do think by the-

237
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,320
- Hold on, I gotta take a second.

238
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,190
- You good?

239
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,023
- Real nervous.

240
00:06:08,023 --> 00:06:08,856
- For what?

241
00:06:08,856 --> 00:06:09,689
- For the bungee jump, dude!

242
00:06:09,689 --> 00:06:11,230
- I thought you meant for like another watermelon smashing.

243
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,130
I'm like, it's not that big a deal.

244
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:14,106
Now it's time to add in the color-changing glue right now.

245
00:06:14,106 --> 00:06:15,510
This stuff is literally like magic.

246
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,832
The UV rays change the color of this glue.

247
00:06:17,832 --> 00:06:19,507
That's very cool as well.

248
00:06:19,507 --> 00:06:20,730
- Tt's a metallic slime dude.

249
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,240
- Now time to add in the magical liquid

250
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,513
into the color-changing glue.

251
00:06:23,513 --> 00:06:25,107
Oh my gosh, look at that on the inside!

252
00:06:25,107 --> 00:06:26,025
- Whoaaaa

253
00:06:26,025 --> 00:06:27,073
- Because the sun layer wasn't covering it.

254
00:06:27,073 --> 00:06:28,800
Here we go, we're gonna go for the one hand around,

255
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,102
then switch stance, switch stance, switch stance.

256
00:06:30,102 --> 00:06:31,897
It's the stance switch that makes a huge difference.

257
00:06:31,897 --> 00:06:34,160
Dude it's crazy, look at how it's all yellow,

258
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,693
and it starts to change colors, man.

259
00:06:35,693 --> 00:06:38,700
- Alright well now it's time to add this all new, metallic,

260
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,533
magical liquid.

261
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:41,260
- You're gonna add it to me, Devan, that almost got

262
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,093
all over me, bro.

263
00:06:42,093 --> 00:06:43,040
- It's gonna be double metallic.

264
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,960
We prepared the perfect slime for bungee jumping,

265
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,770
but now it is time to prepare ourselves.

266
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,070
I've been told that bungee jumping is like

267
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:50,060
surviving an earthquake while being upside down.

268
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,667
So we've simulated both of those extreme conditions,

269
00:06:51,667 --> 00:06:53,500
and now let's make some slime in them.

270
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,780
In preparation for our 140 foot bungee jump,

271
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,134
you challenged us to make slime-

272
00:06:57,134 --> 00:06:58,395
(screaming)

273
00:06:58,395 --> 00:07:00,339
(bottles rattling)

274
00:07:00,339 --> 00:07:05,339
(Collins and Devan screaming at each other)

275
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,820
- I've got to add some glue!

276
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,100
- Whoa, the tremors stopped.

277
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,170
Okay, wow. This is going to be intense, man.

278
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,680
The point is that as we jump, we're gonna be shaking,

279
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,527
going all over the place, so this is a good preparation,

280
00:07:20,527 --> 00:07:21,360
you know?

281
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,500
Alright got all the beads over here-

282
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,287
(screaming)

283
00:07:24,287 --> 00:07:27,150
(bowls rattling)

284
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:29,665
- I caught some for you! That's for you!

285
00:07:29,665 --> 00:07:30,498
- Thank you!

286
00:07:30,498 --> 00:07:31,900
- If this is any indication of how shaky

287
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,062
the bungee jump is gonna be, bro this is going to be insane.

288
00:07:34,062 --> 00:07:38,805
(Collins and Devin screaming over each other)

289
00:07:38,805 --> 00:07:39,912
(slam)

290
00:07:39,912 --> 00:07:41,271
- Whoa, what was that?

291
00:07:41,271 --> 00:07:43,443
- I was trying to get more of the beads.

292
00:07:43,443 --> 00:07:45,526
(slowed down yelling)

293
00:07:45,526 --> 00:07:46,956
Alright I think I gotta start working on my slime over here,

294
00:07:46,956 --> 00:07:48,850
I'm gonna add in some more metallic glue over here,

295
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:51,998
I enjoy when it's very stable in here, it's very nice.

296
00:07:51,998 --> 00:07:53,480
(Collins and Devan yelling over each other)

297
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,890
Now we just gotta get some things to mix all this around,

298
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,860
we're going to add some of this metallic activator.

299
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,807
- Wow, I am kind of nervous.

300
00:07:58,807 --> 00:08:01,493
(screaming)

301
00:08:01,493 --> 00:08:02,710
- It's so slippery!

302
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:05,371
- I will stabilize you, Devan! You got it!

303
00:08:05,371 --> 00:08:06,204
- I got it, I got it.

304
00:08:06,204 --> 00:08:11,204
(Collins and Devan yelling over each other)

305
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:13,687
- Well, at least in the bungee jump

306
00:08:13,687 --> 00:08:15,350
there aren't gonna be a bunch of beads flying everywhere.

307
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,981
- Just check out that stretch.

308
00:08:16,981 --> 00:08:18,366
- Yo, that is perfect man, that slime is gr-

309
00:08:18,366 --> 00:08:20,959
(screaming)

310
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:23,154
(low rumbling)

311
00:08:23,154 --> 00:08:23,987
(Collins and Devan yelling)

312
00:08:23,987 --> 00:08:27,650
- The pencils are on the ground!

313
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:28,483
- I've lost it.

314
00:08:28,483 --> 00:08:29,547
- You're good, you're good.

315
00:08:29,547 --> 00:08:31,618
I'll help you. I will help you.

316
00:08:31,618 --> 00:08:33,930
Whoa, no. No.

317
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:34,900
- If there's one thing I've learned,

318
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,640
it's that whenever the tremors start, you just gotta chill.

319
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,500
- I had a bucket on the table where did it go?

320
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,403
- Okay, it's down over there.

321
00:08:40,403 --> 00:08:41,650
(screaming)

322
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:42,760
(items clattering)

323
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,613
- Save me! Save me!

324
00:08:43,613 --> 00:08:45,397
- Come back. Come back.

325
00:08:45,397 --> 00:08:47,890
- I've got it, I've got it. Thank you!

326
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:48,813
- Where's my Elmer's glue, bro?

327
00:08:48,813 --> 00:08:50,365
- What do you mean? It's down there!

328
00:08:50,365 --> 00:08:51,430
(Collins and Devan arguing)

329
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,610
(screaming)

330
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:54,443
- Fine.

331
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:56,856
- Oh no, no, no.

332
00:08:56,856 --> 00:08:58,488
I got it. I got it. Pull me back. Take me back.

333
00:08:58,488 --> 00:09:02,220
(Collins and Devan yelling over each other)

334
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,200
- I never thought I'd say this,

335
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,440
but I think I'm actually prepared for the bungee jump.

336
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,848
- We're gonna put on this helmet.

337
00:09:05,848 --> 00:09:07,650
- Why did you just put the helmet on, man?

338
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,528
Take the glue. Let's do it.

339
00:09:09,528 --> 00:09:10,640
- If the earthquake simulator starts, Devan,

340
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,260
I'm just sayin', this might get all over you.

341
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,093
- I don't think it'll start.

342
00:09:13,093 --> 00:09:15,023
- Three, two, one

343
00:09:15,023 --> 00:09:16,564
(screaming)

344
00:09:16,564 --> 00:09:18,072
- I'm trying!

345
00:09:18,072 --> 00:09:19,510
I'm trying my best!

346
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:22,396
I'm doing my best! I've got it. I'm doing a great job!

347
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:24,278
(screaming)

348
00:09:24,278 --> 00:09:26,310
- I'm doing such a great job.

349
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:27,143
Okay, there we go,

350
00:09:27,143 --> 00:09:28,760
And, I think we got it!

351
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,430
I mean in terms of where the glue ended up,

352
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,000
in terms of his proportions, not totally inside there.

353
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,193
- You didn't get it in at all! What are you doing?

354
00:09:35,193 --> 00:09:36,026
- Look at this.

355
00:09:36,026 --> 00:09:37,336
- Bro!

356
00:09:37,336 --> 00:09:38,180
- That's quite a bit all things considered.

357
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,900
- What if this happens to me on the bungee jump.

358
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,080
- Now, while we're here I'm just gonna dump it

359
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,433
into the water, and hopefully it'll absorb on the inside.

360
00:09:42,433 --> 00:09:44,186
This is gonna create a very cool texture.

361
00:09:44,186 --> 00:09:46,360
Ta-da! For the slime!

362
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,350
- Yeah! Great job.

363
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:49,920
I really think this is gonna make a big difference,

364
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,753
so here we go.

365
00:09:50,753 --> 00:09:51,586
Gonna add that in.

366
00:09:51,586 --> 00:09:53,080
I'm gonna grab some of my slime, and use this slime

367
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,950
to hold you in place.

368
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:54,810
So here we go. Boom.

369
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:56,254
I'm gonna put this slime like a little backpack.

370
00:09:56,254 --> 00:09:57,087
A little slime in the backpack, there we go.

371
00:09:57,087 --> 00:09:59,099
And then mix it, mix it mix it.

372
00:09:59,099 --> 00:09:59,949
(screaming)

373
00:09:59,949 --> 00:10:03,032
(objects clattering)

374
00:10:03,866 --> 00:10:05,960
There goes my slime, but don't you worry,

375
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,990
See that little bit on my finger?

376
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:09,075
That's all we need. Here we go. Okay.

377
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:10,425
(Collins and Devan cheering)

378
00:10:10,425 --> 00:10:11,258
(triumphant music)

379
00:10:11,258 --> 00:10:12,190
Look at that! This is perfect!

380
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,534
Oh, how about you grab a side, I'll grab a side,

381
00:10:13,534 --> 00:10:14,776
we'll both stretch it.

382
00:10:14,776 --> 00:10:16,410
- [Together] Three, two, one

383
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:20,077
(Collins and Devan yelling)

384
00:10:21,785 --> 00:10:22,830
- Let's see how the slime looks. Ready?

385
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,663
- Yeah, here we go.

386
00:10:23,663 --> 00:10:24,993
- [Together] Three, two one

387
00:10:26,227 --> 00:10:27,660
- (Collins and Devan cheering)

388
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,200
- We've got the perfect slime, the experience

389
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,228
of being in an earthquake simulator, and now,

390
00:10:30,228 --> 00:10:32,580
the only thing left before we do the bungee jump,

391
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,010
is to make slime upside down, so let's go!

392
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,470
- In preparation for the bungee jump,

393
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,351
let's see what slime ingredients Elmer's sent us.

394
00:10:38,351 --> 00:10:41,220
- Holy cow, that's a ton of ingredients,

395
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,900
and Elmer's challenged us to make slime

396
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,470
in the most extreme conditions.

397
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,500
- What, like upside down?

398
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,049
- Exactly, so right now Devan let's um-

399
00:10:47,049 --> 00:10:50,513
(Collins and Devan talking over each other)

400
00:10:50,513 --> 00:10:52,730
- [Together] We'll figure this out

401
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:54,700
- Yo, I've got my slime dude, this is nuts!

402
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,138
- Oh no, it went down, I lost it all.

403
00:10:56,138 --> 00:10:58,890
- The only difference between this and the bungee jump

404
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:00,850
is that I'll be making slime while hurling

405
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:01,910
towards the ground.

406
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:02,743
That actually doesn't help me out at all.

407
00:11:02,743 --> 00:11:05,450
This is metallic teal glue and confetti magical liquid.

408
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:07,340
- And this is orange glitter and metallic magical liquid

409
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,780
- We're gonna add some ingredients, here we go

410
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,640
So we got this, we're just gonna pop the top off.

411
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,910
- Wait, lemme try to catch it.

412
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:14,357
(Collins and Devan yelling over each other)

413
00:11:14,357 --> 00:11:15,370
- Oh, you missed, you missed!

414
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:18,253
Okay there we go, there we go, dude.

415
00:11:18,253 --> 00:11:19,340
This is insane.

416
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:22,321
- We'll just grab some of this, aw that was a miss.

417
00:11:22,321 --> 00:11:24,220
- Oh! You missed! What are you doing, fam?

418
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,321
Grab some activator, just a little bit of activator.

419
00:11:26,321 --> 00:11:28,984
(guys cheering)

420
00:11:28,984 --> 00:11:30,780
- Just a little bit more.

421
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,033
Holy cow, this is wild.

422
00:11:32,033 --> 00:11:37,033
(Collins and Devan talking over each other)

423
00:11:37,441 --> 00:11:38,650
- We can go fishing a little bit, you know?

424
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:39,966
Yo, yo, let's trade slimes.

425
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:41,275
- [Together] Three, two, one

426
00:11:41,275 --> 00:11:43,953
(slimes splat)

427
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,840
- Wait, let's try to get it in the bucket.

428
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,846
- Oh, that's a good idea.

429
00:11:46,846 --> 00:11:48,610
(Collins and Devon yelling over each other)

430
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:49,805
What just happened?

431
00:11:49,805 --> 00:11:51,497
(Collins and Devan yelling over each other)

432
00:11:51,497 --> 00:11:52,863
- Let me add this, let me add this.

433
00:11:55,264 --> 00:11:56,097
- Whoaaaa

434
00:11:56,097 --> 00:11:56,930
- Holy cow.

435
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:57,930
- This is crazy

436
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,470
- Alright well you know what, I think this is uh-

437
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,710
- This is like a dream.

438
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:01,960
- We're making some new slimes here.

439
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,300
- It's actually way harder than you think

440
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,860
to make slime while hanging upside down.

441
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,720
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, three, two, one

442
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:10,590
(guys groaning)

443
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:12,120
(slime splats in slow motion)

444
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,370
(uptempo electronic music)

445
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,614
- Alright here we go. Look at my balloon.

446
00:12:14,614 --> 00:12:17,168
(Collins and Devan exclaiming in confusion)

447
00:12:17,168 --> 00:12:20,529
- Dude, wait get the balloon back, get it back!

448
00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:21,362
Can you get it back?

449
00:12:21,362 --> 00:12:22,195
(balloon pops)

450
00:12:22,195 --> 00:12:24,266
(guys exclaim in warped slow motion)

451
00:12:24,266 --> 00:12:25,099
- Alright check this out bro, here we go.

452
00:12:25,099 --> 00:12:26,524
Take the top off, it's a magic trick.

453
00:12:26,524 --> 00:12:28,079
- [Together] Three, two, one

454
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,570
- You can't hit me bro, you can't hit me.

455
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:32,050
Look at that, look at that!

456
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:32,883
(dramatic music beat)

457
00:12:32,883 --> 00:12:36,020
- Ohh, you actually got it on me, what are you doing?

458
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,270
- Alright well I think we got the experience

459
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,371
of being upside down, so now it's time for the next thing.

460
00:12:39,371 --> 00:12:40,540
(slime clatters)

461
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,890
- We've made the slimes, we're back here

462
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:42,820
about to bungee jump.

463
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,630
Do not try this at home.

464
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:47,100
We have trained professionals here helping us do this.

465
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,250
First thing we gotta do right now

466
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,540
is just get into the harness.

467
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,440
- And you're going first.

468
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,810
- [Collins] It's a new fashion statement guys.

469
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:52,982
- [Devan] You're gonna look good Collins,

470
00:12:52,982 --> 00:12:53,898
you're gonna look good.

471
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:54,731
- Thank you, man, I can tell

472
00:12:54,731 --> 00:12:56,245
Alright, so guys, for this part, I stick my arms out.

473
00:12:56,245 --> 00:12:58,130
Okay, this is the second harness

474
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:00,330
because again, the bungee is gonna be on my back,

475
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,000
so I'm gonna be going stomach first.

476
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,450
So all I'm seeing on my way down is just the ground

477
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,640
rushing towards my face.

478
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,850
- And the slime that's in your hands.

479
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:07,683
- Exactly.

480
00:13:07,683 --> 00:13:09,237
- I'm feeling the tugging, so we're good?

481
00:13:09,237 --> 00:13:10,440
- We got the thumbs-up.

482
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,560
Here are the slimes that you made, it is getting real man.

483
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,710
- So, I guess these are the slimes

484
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,470
that I'll be mixing on the way down.

485
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:17,710
Time to board the machine.

486
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,190
This is my last time on the ground

487
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,023
before I bungee jump.

488
00:13:20,023 --> 00:13:21,300
Devan, any final words?

489
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,133
- Good luck!

490
00:13:22,133 --> 00:13:22,966
- Thank you, man.

491
00:13:22,966 --> 00:13:23,799
- Climb up here.

492
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:24,632
- Alright dude here you go.

493
00:13:24,632 --> 00:13:25,912
(Collins and Devan cheering)

494
00:13:25,912 --> 00:13:27,754
- And again, huge shout out to Elmer's

495
00:13:27,754 --> 00:13:29,070
for sponsoring this video.

496
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,940
There is no way we would've been able to do this

497
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,320
without Elmer's glue because their glue

498
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,010
is what makes the slime able to be mixed

499
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:35,010
as we're beungee jumping.

500
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:37,383
So we wanna see what you can do with Elmer's glue.

501
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:38,690
A whole bunch of crazy things.

502
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:39,770
Maybe not bungee jumping,

503
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:41,360
but we know you can make some awesome slimes.

504
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,720
So right now it's time to go up, and make some slimes.

505
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,750
- Don't tell him we're talking about him,

506
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,580
but, uh, he doesn't look so good right now.

507
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,890
- Alright, we are going up.

508
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,750
Right now, I got all the slimes here.

509
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,430
I've already had to be up here once, so I'm already

510
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,010
a little bit scared of what this is gonna be like.

511
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:54,940
Oh my gosh, bungee jumping is one thing,

512
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:57,090
trying to mix slime and bungee jump at the same time

513
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:58,510
is a whole different ordeal, man.

514
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,270
That's like a whole level of concentration,

515
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,970
and the ground is getting smaller and smaller.

516
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:03,550
- [Devan] You good? Are you doing okay?

517
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,383
- I don't know!

518
00:14:04,383 --> 00:14:05,420
- [Devan] Can you hear me?

519
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,817
- I can hear you. It's pretty scary up here bro.

520
00:14:07,817 --> 00:14:10,170
- [Devan] It's really, really, real now.

521
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:11,930
- Oh, it's really real now, Devan.

522
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:12,763
There is no turning back.

523
00:14:12,763 --> 00:14:14,670
- Exactly, and worst of all I still forgot,

524
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,287
I still have to try to aim for a bucket.

525
00:14:16,287 --> 00:14:17,201
- Can you wave to me?

526
00:14:17,201 --> 00:14:18,120
- Hi!

527
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,917
- He's now a tiny little speck in the sky.

528
00:14:19,917 --> 00:14:21,652
- Help me, help.

529
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,720
It's a whole different ballgame up here.

530
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,553
When you're down there, you're like,

531
00:14:24,553 --> 00:14:25,820
wow, what a large space we're in.

532
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,860
When you're up here, you're like oh, it's not that big.

533
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,760
Feeling like a little hole you're trying to jump into man.

534
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,220
Alright guys so the moment has come.

535
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,490
Time for me to pick up these slimes,

536
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:33,530
and we're just gonna be jumping off.

537
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:35,370
Bro, my heart is beating so fast.

538
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:37,354
Holy cow, I am so nervous right now.

539
00:14:37,354 --> 00:14:38,940
Dude, I think I can see the beach and my house from here,

540
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,820
This is one of the best views in all of Los Angeles.

541
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,580
Unfortunately, the only way to get down is by jumping.

542
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:46,107
- Oh jeez, I'm nervous for myself 'cause I'm gonna have to

543
00:14:46,107 --> 00:14:47,660
do this in just a moment.

544
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,316
- Alright here we go, about to grab the first slime.

545
00:14:49,316 --> 00:14:51,770
Boom! There we go we've got it.

546
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:53,610
Here we go, about to grab the second slime.

547
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:54,698
Boom! Here we go.

548
00:14:54,698 --> 00:14:56,562
- Oh, he's stepping towards the plank.

549
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,840
He's stepping towards the platform.

550
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,120
- Got the two slimes, as you can tell, and now

551
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,570
this is the jump.

552
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,273
Yeah, this is nuts.

553
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:08,930
Alright here we go, three,

554
00:15:10,762 --> 00:15:11,595
two,

555
00:15:13,284 --> 00:15:14,869
one!

556
00:15:14,869 --> 00:15:17,869
(Collins screaming)

557
00:15:19,442 --> 00:15:23,222
Oh my gosh, this is the scariest thing ever!

558
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:24,947
Oh my gosh!

559
00:15:24,947 --> 00:15:25,780
Oh my gosh!

560
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,930
I can't even see the bucket! There it is!

561
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:32,930
Oh my goodness, I was not ready! I was not ready at all!

562
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:34,708
Holy cow! Yeet!

563
00:15:36,363 --> 00:15:38,001
- Ohhh, and he missed!

564
00:15:38,001 --> 00:15:39,696
All of that, and he missed!

565
00:15:39,696 --> 00:15:41,170
- I did my best bro.

566
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:43,700
That was the scariest thing I have ever done.

567
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,230
When you get up there, you will see.

568
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,170
It is very hard to hit the bucket, okay Devan?

569
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:49,670
Like, I gotta say, that was actually pretty close.

570
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,503
- [Devan] I believe you.

571
00:15:50,503 --> 00:15:52,270
- I'm surprised I got that close.

572
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,300
- [Devan] You are very brave.

573
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,133
- Thank you

574
00:15:54,133 --> 00:15:55,541
(clapping)

575
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:56,374
(people cheering)

576
00:15:56,374 --> 00:15:57,207
- Bravo, bravo.

577
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:01,090
- So this is it, this is the slime, and I gotta say guys,

578
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:03,090
I know, it looks like quite a large margin,

579
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:04,690
but when you are that high in the air,

580
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:06,283
I'm shocked I even got it this close.

581
00:16:06,283 --> 00:16:07,443
- [Devan] That was actually pretty close.

582
00:16:07,443 --> 00:16:08,830
- That was actually pretty close!

583
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,150
I think I have a different method, though.

584
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:12,160
I think I'm gonna try something different.

585
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,830
Yeah, if I do it at all, 'cause that was terrifying.

586
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:16,500
- It's a different ballgame when you're up there.

587
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,160
- I'm already not a fan of this, you know.

588
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,740
Like that feeling that you get when you're falling?

589
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,939
Did you get that feeling?

590
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,010
- It's more the psychological element of it,

591
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:24,937
'cause you're just watching the ground rush towards you.

592
00:16:24,937 --> 00:16:27,110
(Devin groans)

593
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,100
I was just trying to do my best,

594
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,420
I lost some pieces of it bro.

595
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,050
- You lost like half of it, it's over there, over there.

596
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:32,350
- In my defense, the wind is rushing past you.

597
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:33,970
- Look at how far that went.

598
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:35,775
- In all honesty, that could've been the slime that I aimed,

599
00:16:35,775 --> 00:16:37,658
but instead I got it, like that's pretty close.

600
00:16:37,658 --> 00:16:39,230
I wanna see you do closer man.

601
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,646
We're leaving that there to see if you can do closer.

602
00:16:40,646 --> 00:16:41,660
- Oh jeez.

603
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,010
- So guys if that's where mine landed,

604
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,970
and I'm the one who just kinda jumped headfirst into things,

605
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,850
where do you think Devin's slime is gonna land?

606
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:48,300
Comment down below, will it hit the tarp,

607
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,800
will it hit outside, or is it gonna hit

608
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,390
somewhere completely else in Los Angeles.

609
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,383
So comment down below right now.

610
00:16:52,383 --> 00:16:54,385
- Alright it's my turn, here we go.

611
00:16:54,385 --> 00:16:57,210
Oh man, the heart is just going so fast.

612
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:58,770
- Oh my gosh, your face looks a little pale,

613
00:16:58,770 --> 00:16:59,603
I do have to say right now.

614
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:01,460
- Well I did put on sunscreen, so maybe it's that.

615
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,330
- Hopefully it's just that.

616
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:03,530
- [Collins] You have a separate strategy

617
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:04,457
on how you're planning on mixing your slime.

618
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:07,021
- You know, I think I'm just gonna have to wing it, man.

619
00:17:07,021 --> 00:17:09,560
It's gonna be crazy, I don't know how I'm gonna

620
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,697
concentrate on that and also not concentrate,

621
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,339
I'm about to, you know, smack the ground.

622
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:16,540
- If I can give you one tip, it's when you go out,

623
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,840
it's like the whole kind of thing is like moving.

624
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,930
It's swaying a little bit,

625
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:23,100
so it makes it feel even a little bit scarier

626
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,841
because there's this whole added motion.

627
00:17:24,841 --> 00:17:26,140
- Thanks. Appreciate that.

628
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,871
- So you go, these are the slimes.

629
00:17:27,871 --> 00:17:28,704
(Collins and Devan talking over each other)

630
00:17:28,704 --> 00:17:29,537
- I think I did a good job, right?

631
00:17:29,537 --> 00:17:32,100
- He did a good job on the slimes, but now the question is,

632
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,720
is he going to be able to mix them?

633
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,191
- Hold on, I gotta tighten my helmet. It's a little loose.

634
00:17:36,191 --> 00:17:38,298
- Safety is extremely important as we're doing this.

635
00:17:38,298 --> 00:17:39,131
(Devan screams)

636
00:17:39,131 --> 00:17:39,964
You good?

637
00:17:39,964 --> 00:17:40,797
- Yep, it's gonna work.

638
00:17:40,797 --> 00:17:41,630
Alright here we go.

639
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:42,463
- Alright Devan's hopping on.

640
00:17:42,463 --> 00:17:43,296
- Give me a high five!

641
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:44,129
You got this bro.

642
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:44,962
- Thank you very much.

643
00:17:44,962 --> 00:17:45,795
- I believe in you Devan.

644
00:17:45,795 --> 00:17:47,990
- Thank you, I'm actually not nervous yet.

645
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:49,280
- Just let me know when you start to get nervous.

646
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,470
- Okay, do you have the bullhorn?

647
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,303
Grab the bullhorn!

648
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:52,140
- Okay, grab it.

649
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,090
- Devan what's the verdict?

650
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:55,174
- You guys are lucky, you get to just watch.

651
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:56,570
It's terrifying.

652
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,730
So far, this is a beautiful view.

653
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:00,570
Just look over the edge real quick.

654
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:03,540
That is just terrifying, and it doesn't look as scary

655
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,460
on camera as it does in real life.

656
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,960
- Is it getting a little bit scarier, Devan?

657
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,160
- Not a little bit! Actually, quite a lot a bit!

658
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,960
- Yeah, you're getting pretty high up there now, Devan.

659
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,930
- Uh huh, and we're not even to the top yet.

660
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:14,830
- When I got to that point, I was like tripping out.

661
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,346
He seems to be handling it a lot better than I was.

662
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:18,627
- Dude! I am terrified!

663
00:18:18,627 --> 00:18:20,880
- I can only imagine what's going through his head right now

664
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,907
- Was Collins this scared? This is like mind-boggling.

665
00:18:23,907 --> 00:18:25,629
Just look over the edge real quick.

666
00:18:25,629 --> 00:18:28,160
I got people in like apartments watching me.

667
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,070
What is going on?

668
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,760
- Right now I'm sure he's getting instructions and stuff.

669
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,310
Bro, I was just stalling up there.

670
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,143
Everything I could think of,

671
00:18:33,143 --> 00:18:34,860
like how could I possibly stall this situation

672
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:35,693
just a moment longer?

673
00:18:35,693 --> 00:18:37,970
- Is it good to go now, even though my heart's going crazy?

674
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:39,370
- Oh yeah, absolutely.

675
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:41,700
- Alright here we go, I am about to jump.

676
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,803
Collins, can you see me?

677
00:18:42,803 --> 00:18:44,040
- [Collins] You got this bro!

678
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,267
- Dude, this is crazy.

679
00:18:45,267 --> 00:18:48,840
Comment down below, "You got this Devan!" 'cause I need it.

680
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,750
- Devan! Devan! You got this bro!

681
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:52,583
- You ready?

682
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:53,981
- Just his little head pops out over the edge, oh my gosh.

683
00:18:53,981 --> 00:18:56,020
Devan, you got your slime right?

684
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:56,930
- I got my slime!

685
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,270
- Cause otherwise, you're gonna have to do this again.

686
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,160
- All right, I'm grabbing my slime right now.

687
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,040
It feels very unstable, I have to say.

688
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:02,897
- He isn't ready.

689
00:19:02,897 --> 00:19:05,040
- How long of a drop is it? Like two seconds?

690
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,230
Three seconds? Four seconds?

691
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,320
- 140 feet of fun.

692
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,153
- Here's my slime.

693
00:19:08,153 --> 00:19:09,710
- Alright he's going for it. This one's for real, guys.

694
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:11,854
- Here we go, three, two, one.

695
00:19:11,854 --> 00:19:13,671
(Devan and Collins screaming)

696
00:19:13,671 --> 00:19:14,504
- [Collins] Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!

697
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,580
- Oh my goodness!

698
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,413
- [Collins] Holy cow!

699
00:19:18,413 --> 00:19:19,246
- That was insane!

700
00:19:19,246 --> 00:19:22,000
- I got a little of the slime, NO!

701
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,485
That was the scariest thing I've ever done.

702
00:19:24,485 --> 00:19:26,256
Can I make this little bit of slime?

703
00:19:26,256 --> 00:19:28,260
- See if you can get that little bit of slime in the bucket,

704
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,550
You've still got a chance, Devan.

705
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:32,067
- See if I can make it, see if I can make it.

706
00:19:32,067 --> 00:19:34,880
Oh man, that was close.

707
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,160
Dude, you were right, that was the scariest thing

708
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:37,993
I've ever done.

709
00:19:37,993 --> 00:19:38,826
- I gotta give you credit bro,

710
00:19:38,826 --> 00:19:40,260
that's a super scary thing to do, man.

711
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,093
So nicely done.

712
00:19:41,093 --> 00:19:44,853
- Hand me the slime, thank you, I'm gonna dunk it.

713
00:19:44,853 --> 00:19:47,750
(Collins screaming)

714
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,888
- That is cheating! You cannot do that man!

715
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:52,512
(Collins and Devan yelling over each other)

716
00:19:52,512 --> 00:19:55,171
- That does not count, no, no, no.

717
00:19:55,171 --> 00:20:00,171
(Collins and Devan yelling over each other)

718
00:20:02,661 --> 00:20:03,494
- Are you good?

719
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:04,327
- No, I'm not, it's slippery.

720
00:20:04,327 --> 00:20:05,927
- Well, I gotta say, I think my slime barely

721
00:20:05,927 --> 00:20:07,503
got a little bit closer bro.

722
00:20:07,503 --> 00:20:09,347
- [Devan] I think it did. You did a better job.

723
00:20:09,347 --> 00:20:10,478
- [Collins] But how was that?

724
00:20:10,478 --> 00:20:11,900
- [Devan] That was terrifying. What was that, man?

725
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,370
- [Collins] Was it fun, though?

726
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:15,550
- [Devan] It was super fun, like once you're weightless?

727
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,560
Man, that was super fun.

728
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,210
It's just getting over the first hump,

729
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:19,043
that's the craziest part.

730
00:20:19,043 --> 00:20:20,790
= So how about this, since we both were not able

731
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:22,200
to get the slime into the bucket,

732
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,570
let's combine our two slimes, mix them together.

733
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:25,403
Brother power, like this.

734
00:20:25,403 --> 00:20:26,940
On the count of three, we'll both dunk it in the bucket.

735
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:27,773
You ready? All right, here we go, here we go.

736
00:20:27,773 --> 00:20:29,100
- [Together] Three, two, one

737
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:29,933
(slime splats)

738
00:20:29,933 --> 00:20:30,860
- Yes! - Boom, there we go, guys.

739
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,160
So thank you so much for watching, and a huge thank you

740
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,630
to Elmer's for making all of this possible.

741
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:36,580
What if Elmer's challenged you to make extreme slime?

742
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,800
What slime would you make?

743
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,110

You got five seconds, here we go.

747

- [Together] Five, four, three, two, one, done!

748
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:48,057
Love you! [Together] Bye!
