00:00:00,218 --> 00:00:01,839
- What's up everybody, it is Collins Key,

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,101
and welcome back to the Thursday vlog.

3
00:00:04,101 --> 00:00:07,108
So today is the day I am officially back to vlogging.

4
00:00:07,108 --> 00:00:08,822
By the way, for a moment, can we just appreciate,

5
00:00:08,822 --> 00:00:11,283
y'all see this desk?

6
00:00:11,283 --> 00:00:13,108
This desk is gorgeous.

7
00:00:13,108 --> 00:00:14,378
It's not cluttered.

8
00:00:14,378 --> 00:00:16,227
And maybe just in case you're new to my vlogs,

9
00:00:16,227 --> 00:00:18,532
I just want to show you what my desk looks like

10
00:00:18,532 --> 00:00:19,968
before I cleaned it up.

11
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:23,316
(dramatic music)

12
00:00:23,316 --> 00:00:24,414
And now that I'm back from the tour,

13
00:00:24,414 --> 00:00:25,596
you know what that means!

14
00:00:25,596 --> 00:00:26,909
No Collins, what does that mean?

15
00:00:26,909 --> 00:00:29,801
It means these Thursday vlogs are back on schedule,

16
00:00:29,801 --> 00:00:30,931
every single Thursday.

17
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:32,929
If you guys are excited that Thursday vlogs are back,

18
00:00:32,929 --> 00:00:35,098
let me know by hitting the like button down below.

19
00:00:35,098 --> 00:00:36,543
To celebrate my return to vlogging,

20
00:00:36,543 --> 00:00:39,722
I thought it would be kinda fun to do a #AskCollinsKey.

21
00:00:39,722 --> 00:00:41,439
Because, I mean, who knows, over the last few months,

22
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:42,709
I might have changed a lot.

23
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:43,680
Probably not.

24
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,090
But anyways, I asked you guys on Twitter

25
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,339
to send me some cool questions,

26
00:00:46,339 --> 00:00:48,200
and here are a few of my favorites.

27
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,291
If you had a chance to speak to a camel in Egypt,

28
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:51,371
what would you tell it?

29
00:00:51,371 --> 00:00:52,272
Probably either,

30
00:00:52,272 --> 00:00:54,483
Bro, you're a camel.

31
00:00:54,483 --> 00:00:55,329
Enjoy it.

32
00:00:55,329 --> 00:00:56,162
Or,

33
00:00:56,162 --> 00:00:58,596
♫ My hump, my hump, my hump, my hump

34
00:00:58,596 --> 00:01:01,904
Emmy said, "Collins, try to say your whole name backwards".

35
00:01:01,904 --> 00:01:03,752
Yeek Schnil-lock.

36
00:01:03,752 --> 00:01:05,236
Schnil-lock, that sounds like villain's name,

37
00:01:05,236 --> 00:01:06,825
it sounds like it would be in Harry Potter.

38
00:01:06,825 --> 00:01:07,743
All the students are like,

39
00:01:07,743 --> 00:01:10,205
"Oh no, I hate Schnil-lock, meh!"

40
00:01:10,205 --> 00:01:12,701
'Cause that's how British people act, meh!

41
00:01:12,701 --> 00:01:13,877
If you're British and watching this video,

42
00:01:13,877 --> 00:01:15,189
please, I don't mean to offend you.

43
00:01:15,189 --> 00:01:16,777
And actually, I want you guys to comment down below:

44
00:01:16,777 --> 00:01:18,204
what is your name backward?

45
00:01:18,204 --> 00:01:20,477
Ana said, "Does Houdini play a role in your magic?"

46
00:01:20,477 --> 00:01:22,724
No, but that's only because he's dead.

47
00:01:22,724 --> 00:01:26,843
♫ In the arms of the an-

48
00:01:26,843 --> 00:01:28,368
Would you rather have a pause button

49
00:01:28,368 --> 00:01:30,744
or a rewind button in real life?

50
00:01:30,744 --> 00:01:32,002
Definitely a pause button.

51
00:01:32,002 --> 00:01:33,424
Basically when it comes to my life,

52
00:01:33,424 --> 00:01:34,502
anything I've done in the past,

53
00:01:34,502 --> 00:01:35,924
I kinda live it under the guard of--

54
00:01:35,924 --> 00:01:36,804
- No regrets.

55
00:01:36,804 --> 00:01:38,332
- So the reason I wanna have a pause button

56
00:01:38,332 --> 00:01:39,790
is because I could do freaking awesome magic.

57
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:41,335
Could you imagine if I was here one second,

58
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:43,729
I'd just pause, and the next thing you know I'm just gone.

59
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:44,883
Like, I'm just not even there anymore.

60
00:01:44,883 --> 00:01:45,986
How crazy would that be?

61
00:01:45,986 --> 00:01:48,313
And then I just pause again, and then I was back.

62
00:01:48,313 --> 00:01:52,088
What do you think about lip piercings?

63
00:01:52,088 --> 00:01:53,092
Not for me.

64
00:01:53,092 --> 00:01:53,925
Can you hug me?

65
00:01:53,925 --> 00:01:55,898
Absolutely, I don't know how to do this through a camera

66
00:01:55,898 --> 00:01:58,398
but I'll give it my best shot.

67
00:02:01,115 --> 00:02:04,148
(camera muffling)

68
00:02:04,148 --> 00:02:05,712
That's probably the most awkward thing I did all day.

69
00:02:05,712 --> 00:02:07,578
Is magic really magic if you know

70
00:02:07,578 --> 00:02:09,710
that the magic behind the magic isn't magic?

71
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:10,543
#Magic

72
00:02:12,622 --> 00:02:13,505
Magic!

73
00:02:13,505 --> 00:02:14,338
What?

74
00:02:14,338 --> 00:02:18,789
How much does your key necklace mean to you?

75
00:02:18,789 --> 00:02:21,205
I forgot to put it on for this video!

76
00:02:21,205 --> 00:02:22,725
Earlier, I said that I would definitely pause time.

77
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:25,141
Now I think I might rewind time, put on my key necklace

78
00:02:25,141 --> 00:02:26,432
and shoot this whole video over again.

79
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:28,338
Alright, there we go. See, boom.

80
00:02:28,338 --> 00:02:30,320
Basically, it was on this entire time,

81
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:34,487
and y'alls didn't even know it! (laughing)

82
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:36,416
My god!

83
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,680
Hit that like button if you guys actually noticed

84
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,851
that my key was missing.

85
00:02:38,851 --> 00:02:40,649
You got a bae or nah?

86
00:02:40,649 --> 00:02:42,104
(tongue clicks)

87
00:02:42,104 --> 00:02:43,401
Or nah.

88
00:02:43,401 --> 00:02:45,305
♫ Don't play with a boss

89
00:02:45,305 --> 00:02:47,055
♫ Is you really 'bout your money or nah

90
00:02:47,055 --> 00:02:48,723
♫ Is you with this shiz or nah

91
00:02:48,723 --> 00:02:50,799
♫ Or nah, oh nah

92
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:51,632
- No regrets.

93
00:02:51,632 --> 00:02:52,585

(upbeat techno music)

109
00:03:32,322 --> 00:03:33,155
- No regrets - What?
