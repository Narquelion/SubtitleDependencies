1
00:00:00,279 --> 00:00:01,256
- Bouncy egg!

2
00:00:01,256 --> 00:00:02,892
- Yo, that's awesome, let me try.

3
00:00:02,892 --> 00:00:03,815
- No! - Oh no!

4
00:00:03,815 --> 00:00:05,266
- That's a real egg.

5
00:00:05,266 --> 00:00:06,277
- Yeah well you've challenged us

6
00:00:06,277 --> 00:00:09,008
to turn objects into DIY edible foods.

7
00:00:09,008 --> 00:00:10,301
So right now, we're going to teach you

8
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:11,733
how to make a bouncy egg.

9
00:00:11,733 --> 00:00:12,674
That is so cool!

10
00:00:12,674 --> 00:00:14,568
So we're kicking it off right now with a cup,

11
00:00:14,568 --> 00:00:16,069
an egg, and then vinegar.

12
00:00:16,069 --> 00:00:17,582
Then you're just gonna dump the vinegar inside.

13
00:00:17,582 --> 00:00:18,415
- Oh.

14
00:00:18,415 --> 00:00:19,248
- Did you just spray that everywhere?

15
00:00:19,248 --> 00:00:20,081
- Really, really?

16
00:00:20,081 --> 00:00:20,914
And it smells too!

17
00:00:20,914 --> 00:00:22,389
- It smells like vinegar now.

18
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:24,677
- But now you're gonna dump it in, Boom! And that's it!

19
00:00:24,677 --> 00:00:26,234
Just let this sit for 24 hours,

20
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:27,861
and then you literally have eggs

21
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,327
you can bounce like this.

22
00:00:29,327 --> 00:00:31,336
Yo, I wonder if this is like blueberry flavored.

23
00:00:31,336 --> 00:00:33,100
- Whoa, bro! Bro, you can't eat that.

24
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,306
It's not the edible version, dude.

25
00:00:34,306 --> 00:00:35,991
- Oh snap. Okay well here's how you make

26
00:00:35,991 --> 00:00:37,617
the edible version of Play-Doh.

27
00:00:37,617 --> 00:00:38,604
Step 1, Devin.

28
00:00:38,604 --> 00:00:39,579
(glass crashes) Oh my gosh!

29
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:42,354
- We need to add a cup of this stuff into this bowl.

30
00:00:42,354 --> 00:00:45,000
Nice! Ow, it seems like it hurt your finger.

31
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,353
Keep going, keep going, keep going.

32
00:00:46,353 --> 00:00:47,386
Stop. Stop stop stop.

33
00:00:47,386 --> 00:00:48,219
Way over!

34
00:00:49,177 --> 00:00:50,080
So you're going to add that in.

35
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:50,913
- Done. (clapping)

36
00:00:50,913 --> 00:00:51,746
Thank you!

37
00:00:51,746 --> 00:00:52,579
- High five!

38
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:53,412
- Yup, yup.

39
00:00:53,412 --> 00:00:54,287
Really? (Collins laughing)

40
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:56,036
- Next up, we have one cup of corn starch.

41
00:00:56,036 --> 00:00:57,565
You guys remember this pool of Oobleck.

42
00:00:57,565 --> 00:00:58,398
- Yes

43
00:00:58,398 --> 00:00:59,317
- Why would you do it over there?

44
00:00:59,317 --> 00:01:00,150
It's not going to be a precise . . .

45
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:00,983
- Awww!

46
00:01:00,983 --> 00:01:02,458
Where is the cup at? Ohhh!

47
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:04,507
- The cup is where it says one cup.

48
00:01:04,507 --> 00:01:05,927
Dude, you okay?

49
00:01:05,927 --> 00:01:06,760
Alright, yeah we got it!

50
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,637
- I'm going to go with about one cup to me!

51
00:01:07,637 --> 00:01:08,968
(pounding and clapping)

52
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:11,439
Next up, we got some applesauce baby puree.

53
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,476
- What are you doing? No, bro, it's baby food!

54
00:01:13,476 --> 00:01:14,855
That's not going to taste good at all!

55
00:01:14,855 --> 00:01:15,688
- What?

56
00:01:16,754 --> 00:01:17,906
Ooh, wow! We're going to go in.

57
00:01:17,906 --> 00:01:18,739
- No, no, no, no!

58
00:01:18,739 --> 00:01:19,572
We're at the cup, we're at the half!

59
00:01:19,572 --> 00:01:20,419
Why are you adding it?

60
00:01:20,419 --> 00:01:21,252
No, don't!

61
00:01:21,252 --> 00:01:22,085
- No more?

62
00:01:22,085 --> 00:01:22,918
Oooooh!

63
00:01:24,085 --> 00:01:25,089
- Making things with you, man.

64
00:01:25,089 --> 00:01:25,922
This is tough!

65
00:01:25,922 --> 00:01:27,046
- Well, I'm doing my best.

66
00:01:27,046 --> 00:01:28,181
Veggie oil me, Devin!

67
00:01:28,181 --> 00:01:29,014
- I will.

68
00:01:29,014 --> 00:01:30,509
- So I guess we need four of these, so dump it in!

69
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:31,762
I'm going with my hands!

70
00:01:31,762 --> 00:01:33,004
- Oh yeah.

71
00:01:33,004 --> 00:01:34,070
- It's so bizarre!

72
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:35,240
'Cause it's like so many different textures

73
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,404
all coming together.

74
00:01:36,404 --> 00:01:37,962
The corn starch, it just has this like weird like

75
00:01:37,962 --> 00:01:39,844
(imitates creaking) feeling to it.

76
00:01:39,844 --> 00:01:40,793
But you're, Ahh, not my...

77
00:01:40,793 --> 00:01:41,626
- Sorry!

78
00:01:41,626 --> 00:01:44,092
- There we go. Perfect. Okay, done! This is legit working!

79
00:01:44,092 --> 00:01:45,706
We're making edible Play-Doh!

80
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:48,406
Oh wow, that looks interesting!

81
00:01:48,406 --> 00:01:50,789
- Yo, I'm going to need way more food coloring than this.

82
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:52,021
- Yeah.

83
00:01:52,021 --> 00:01:53,234
- Hopefully this works a little bit better.

84
00:01:53,234 --> 00:01:54,803
- Oh, it looks like a heart!

85
00:01:54,803 --> 00:01:55,636
(Collins guffawing)

86
00:01:55,636 --> 00:01:58,155
- Look at that! Oh my Gosh! It's disgusting!

87
00:01:58,155 --> 00:01:59,904
- You should put that away! That looks really gross!

88
00:01:59,904 --> 00:02:01,070
- This one seems like this has

89
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,500
a lot better chance of working.

90
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,021
And now it looks like it has mildew on it!

91
00:02:05,021 --> 00:02:08,126
It looks like it's just a mildewing bunch of batter, man!

92
00:02:08,126 --> 00:02:09,935
That's not what I was going for!

93
00:02:09,935 --> 00:02:10,838
- Get your 'dohs right, bro.

94
00:02:10,838 --> 00:02:12,399
- Get your 'dohs right, bruh.

95
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:14,499
Maybe this is a fail, but maybe it'll taste good, though.

96
00:02:14,499 --> 00:02:15,347
Alright, that's it!

97
00:02:15,347 --> 00:02:18,029
These are the finished products of the Play-Dohs.

98
00:02:18,029 --> 00:02:20,213
And I must admit, definitely not as cool

99
00:02:20,213 --> 00:02:21,463
as I thought it would be.

100
00:02:21,463 --> 00:02:23,033
We're going to see how these taste at the end of the video,

101
00:02:23,033 --> 00:02:23,946
but right now, (shouts)

102
00:02:23,946 --> 00:02:25,547
we're going to make the next edible item.

103
00:02:25,547 --> 00:02:26,636
That was a great catch!

104
00:02:26,636 --> 00:02:28,443
- This is edible glass.

105
00:02:28,443 --> 00:02:30,615
- No way! That's awesome! - No no no no no! Bro!

106
00:02:30,615 --> 00:02:31,730
This is real glass!

107
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:32,987
We're making edible glass!

108
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:34,210
- Oh, okay, that makes more sense!

109
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:35,542
I'm like that looks very real to me.

110
00:02:35,542 --> 00:02:38,844
- To kick it off, we need two cups of sugar.

111
00:02:38,844 --> 00:02:41,201
Bro, what are you doing?

112
00:02:41,201 --> 00:02:42,034
Tell me when

113
00:02:42,034 --> 00:02:42,967
- Keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going,

114
00:02:42,967 --> 00:02:44,394
go go go go go!

115
00:02:44,394 --> 00:02:47,090
- I wonder what it feels like, whoa.

116
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:48,430
- 3/4 a cup of water.

117
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,744
2/3 a cup of... what is this stuff?

118
00:02:49,744 --> 00:02:50,821
Light corn syrup.

119
00:02:50,821 --> 00:02:51,855
Look how thick this stuff is.

120
00:02:51,855 --> 00:02:53,211
Now it's time to mix it up.

121
00:02:53,211 --> 00:02:54,044
So Devon, grab a spoon.

122
00:02:54,044 --> 00:02:55,387
What's crazy about this is, like,

123
00:02:55,387 --> 00:02:57,554
it's literally all sugar.

124
00:02:58,942 --> 00:03:00,242
Whoa, whoa, Devon, okay, you need, dude.

125
00:03:00,242 --> 00:03:02,407
Devon's not playing well with others today at all!

126
00:03:02,407 --> 00:03:04,098
To make this stuff, you need to boil it

127
00:03:04,098 --> 00:03:05,356
for an hour or so.

128
00:03:05,356 --> 00:03:06,412
We're going to be doing this

129
00:03:06,412 --> 00:03:08,660
for a long time, and we will see you guys in an hour.

130
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,887
- [Narrator] One hour later.

131
00:03:11,013 --> 00:03:12,169
- And we're done!

132
00:03:12,169 --> 00:03:13,002
There we go!

133
00:03:13,002 --> 00:03:15,113
This have now been heated up to over 300 degrees,

134
00:03:15,113 --> 00:03:19,090
and we are about to make the liquid glass, so here we go!

135
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,469
- We're about to make the liquid glass.

136
00:03:20,469 --> 00:03:21,463
Oooh!

137
00:03:21,463 --> 00:03:22,877
(spits) Ahh!

138
00:03:22,877 --> 00:03:24,699
(Devon laughs)

139
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:25,587
- Alright, there we go!

140
00:03:25,587 --> 00:03:26,420
- [Devon] Nice!

141
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,740
- The final step, we've got to pop this in the fridge,

142
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,690
let it settle, and then we literally get to eat glass!

143
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:31,523
- Bro!

144
00:03:31,523 --> 00:03:33,629
- What? So again, we'll be back in another couple of hours.

145
00:03:33,629 --> 00:03:34,462
So Devon, time to sleep!

146
00:03:34,462 --> 00:03:35,367
- Yeah, quick nap.

147
00:03:35,367 --> 00:03:36,271
- No, we've gotta put it in the fridge first.

148
00:03:36,271 --> 00:03:37,388
- Oh, yeah! (laughs)

149
00:03:37,388 --> 00:03:39,428
- Alright here we go guys, liquid glass!

150
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:40,561
Let's see how it turned out!

151
00:03:40,561 --> 00:03:41,402
You ready, Here we go!

152
00:03:41,402 --> 00:03:43,902
Three, two, one... But first, we wanted to let you know

153
00:03:43,902 --> 00:03:45,380
that we're giving away an iPhone X

154
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:48,340
as well as 10 $500 gift cards.

155
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,518
If you want to find out how to win those,

156
00:03:49,518 --> 00:03:51,006
stick around, but right now, let's see

157
00:03:51,006 --> 00:03:51,895
how this thing turned out.

158
00:03:51,895 --> 00:03:52,843
Alright, here we go!

159
00:03:52,843 --> 00:03:54,859
Three, two, one!

160
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,617
Yo, this looks crazy!

161
00:03:56,617 --> 00:03:57,450
- Dude!

162
00:03:58,723 --> 00:03:59,556
What?

163
00:03:59,556 --> 00:04:00,622
- And here's the craziest thing!

164
00:04:00,622 --> 00:04:01,697
If you drop it, it will literally crack

165
00:04:01,697 --> 00:04:04,331
and, like, shatter into edible pieces.

166
00:04:04,331 --> 00:04:05,427
- Three, two, one!

167
00:04:05,427 --> 00:04:07,065
(crash)

168
00:04:07,065 --> 00:04:09,151
- Oh, alright, dude, that's it!

169
00:04:09,151 --> 00:04:11,174
A chunk of the edible glass broke!

170
00:04:11,174 --> 00:04:13,175
We're gonna be eating this at the end of the video!

171
00:04:13,175 --> 00:04:15,193
I cannot wait to just, like, eat glass!

172
00:04:15,193 --> 00:04:16,388
I've never done that before!

173
00:04:16,388 --> 00:04:18,932
You challenged us to somehow turn an ordinary egg

174
00:04:18,932 --> 00:04:20,985
into a crystal, so to do this...

175
00:04:20,985 --> 00:04:23,917
A crystal, worth hundreds of thousands of dollars!

176
00:04:23,917 --> 00:04:26,990
So first, we have to empty out the egg without breaking it.

177
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:27,955
You're going to take your push pin,

178
00:04:27,955 --> 00:04:29,844
and you're going to stick it right in the top.

179
00:04:29,844 --> 00:04:30,695
- Oh oh oh!

180
00:04:30,695 --> 00:04:32,442
I got it! I'm a pro! Already!

181
00:04:32,442 --> 00:04:33,645
- Okay, there we go! Perfect!

182
00:04:33,645 --> 00:04:35,572
Now we're going to flip the egg over on the other side.

183
00:04:35,572 --> 00:04:38,233
And you're gonna poke a hole in the other side.

184
00:04:38,233 --> 00:04:39,638
And then the next part is where this whole thing

185
00:04:39,638 --> 00:04:40,950
gets kind of crazy, and it...

186
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:43,403
Ow-ooh, ow-ooh, ow-ooh! - Did you just poke yourself!

187
00:04:43,403 --> 00:04:44,949
- No! Now to empty out the egg,

188
00:04:44,949 --> 00:04:47,812
you literally have to blow the egg out of that little hole.

189
00:04:47,812 --> 00:04:49,467
- Feels like this is going to take forever.

190
00:04:49,467 --> 00:04:51,222
- Our faces are going to turn very red

191
00:04:51,222 --> 00:04:53,439
in like three, two, one.

192
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:56,189
(dramatic music)

193
00:04:58,235 --> 00:04:59,785
I'm getting a little bit, though.

194
00:04:59,785 --> 00:05:01,049
- Oh, it came out the other side!

195
00:05:01,049 --> 00:05:02,715
- [Collins] Came out the other side? (struggled blowing)

196
00:05:02,715 --> 00:05:04,307
- Ohhhhhhh!

197
00:05:04,307 --> 00:05:05,236
- Oh my gosh, yo!

198
00:05:05,236 --> 00:05:06,285
My head hurts!

199
00:05:06,285 --> 00:05:09,217
Is this supposed to be this hard?

200
00:05:09,217 --> 00:05:10,355
Dude, I'm so light-headed right now!

201
00:05:10,355 --> 00:05:11,349
(panting)

202
00:05:11,349 --> 00:05:12,886
But it's working, though, it's working!

203
00:05:12,886 --> 00:05:14,201
Don't do that, you're gonna break it.

204
00:05:14,201 --> 00:05:15,034
Center myself.

205
00:05:15,034 --> 00:05:16,990
(inhaling)

206
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:17,903
(blowing)

207
00:05:17,903 --> 00:05:18,736
(Devon coughs)

208
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:20,694
(Collins screeching)

209
00:05:20,694 --> 00:05:22,685
- Maybe if you just...

210
00:05:22,685 --> 00:05:24,943
Oh no! I cracked my egg!

211
00:05:24,943 --> 00:05:26,370
I got it, the yoke is out.

212
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:27,203
- Shh.

213
00:05:27,203 --> 00:05:28,036
- What what what what?

214
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:28,869
(tiny squeak)

215
00:05:28,869 --> 00:05:29,702
- My egg is like signaling back to me, I'm like

216
00:05:29,702 --> 00:05:30,535
(Collins squeaking)

217
00:05:30,535 --> 00:05:31,368
My egg's like

218
00:05:31,368 --> 00:05:34,168
(Collins squeaking)

219
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:36,392
- [Devon] Bro! What on earth?

220
00:05:36,392 --> 00:05:37,609
- I've done it!

221
00:05:37,609 --> 00:05:39,275
Yes! And you know what the best part is, Devin,

222
00:05:39,275 --> 00:05:40,108
- What?

223
00:05:40,108 --> 00:05:41,260
- after all that work, you know what I have to do?

224
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,093
Have to cut it.

225
00:05:42,093 --> 00:05:42,926
- [Devin] What?

226
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:43,760
- Oh, man!

227
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,915
- You're telling me I could

228
00:05:44,915 --> 00:05:46,491
have just cut it from the beginning?

229
00:05:46,491 --> 00:05:47,324
Really?

230
00:05:47,324 --> 00:05:48,157
- Almost there.

231
00:05:48,157 --> 00:05:48,990
So close, so close.

232
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:49,823
Yes!

233
00:05:49,823 --> 00:05:51,524
The bottom half is better than the top...

234
00:05:51,524 --> 00:05:52,461
No! No, no, no.

235
00:05:52,461 --> 00:05:54,064
So once you've blown out your egg and then cut it,

236
00:05:54,064 --> 00:05:55,423
or just cut it from the beginning.

237
00:05:55,423 --> 00:05:56,552
I would suggest cutting from the beginning

238
00:05:56,552 --> 00:05:57,870
cause as you guys can tell by my face,

239
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:58,963
yeah, it's not the way to go.

240
00:05:58,963 --> 00:05:59,796
Devin, catch! (Devil wailing)

241
00:05:59,796 --> 00:06:01,504
So now we're going to take some paint brushes,

242
00:06:01,504 --> 00:06:02,436
you're going to put some glue

243
00:06:02,436 --> 00:06:04,900
on the end of your paint brush. No, no, no, no, no!

244
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,244
You're going to paint the inside of the egg

245
00:06:08,244 --> 00:06:10,291
with the glue. Now we just have to take this alum.

246
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:11,124
Alum?

247
00:06:11,124 --> 00:06:11,957
- Alum?

248
00:06:11,957 --> 00:06:13,760
- Alum, I don't know. There's powder. (cracking)

249
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,593
- Ow

250
00:06:14,593 --> 00:06:15,426
- Ow

251
00:06:15,426 --> 00:06:17,092
- Ow! Wow, that's quite a coating, Collins.

252
00:06:17,092 --> 00:06:18,625
Okay Devon, we're gonna need eight cups for this part.

253
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:19,458
- I got you bro.

254
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:20,471
- No! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

255
00:06:20,471 --> 00:06:23,412
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

256
00:06:23,412 --> 00:06:26,212
(laughing)

257
00:06:26,212 --> 00:06:28,656
Boom! Just like that we're full of water!

258
00:06:28,656 --> 00:06:30,558
So now we gotta take some of this powder,

259
00:06:30,558 --> 00:06:31,855
we're gonna add it to each cup.

260
00:06:31,855 --> 00:06:34,067
Next up here Devon, we're gonna add some food dye.

261
00:06:34,067 --> 00:06:35,990
I'm still blown away by the fact that these eggs

262
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,948
are gonna legit turn into edible crystals.

263
00:06:37,948 --> 00:06:39,854
So the final step now is to take the eggs,

264
00:06:39,854 --> 00:06:40,687
- Oh, okay.

265
00:06:40,687 --> 00:06:41,786
- and pop them on top like little boats.

266
00:06:41,786 --> 00:06:42,619
- Like a little boat?

267
00:06:42,619 --> 00:06:43,452
- Like a little boat.

268
00:06:43,452 --> 00:06:44,285
- [Devon] I don't know

269
00:06:44,285 --> 00:06:45,405
- Oh, snap. Okay there we go.

270
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,425
Now take a spoon, Devon, and push them down to the bottom.

271
00:06:48,425 --> 00:06:52,108
Yo! Look I legit didn't think it would be this cool.

272
00:06:52,108 --> 00:06:53,186
But this is awesome.

273
00:06:53,186 --> 00:06:55,604
Now you just have to leave them out for a day or longer.

274
00:06:55,604 --> 00:06:57,212
Basically, the more time you leave them out for,

275
00:06:57,212 --> 00:06:59,496
the crazier crystals you're gonna get.

276
00:06:59,496 --> 00:07:01,017
So right now let's actually fast forward

277
00:07:01,017 --> 00:07:02,166
through space and time.

278
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:03,832
There we go!

279
00:07:03,832 --> 00:07:05,880
Look at how much water evaporated.

280
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,883
This is the big reveal.

281
00:07:06,883 --> 00:07:08,958
Time to see how this crystal egg turned out.

282
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:11,065
And I can say it looks crazy just in the liquid right now.

283
00:07:11,065 --> 00:07:12,801
- Bro (laughing)

284
00:07:12,801 --> 00:07:15,092
- Let's see how this thing looks. Here we go. Three, Two...

285
00:07:15,092 --> 00:07:16,075
- Wait, wait, wait!

286
00:07:16,075 --> 00:07:16,908
Oh yeah! Five seconds to subscribe challenge!

287
00:07:16,908 --> 00:07:18,783
We wanted to see if you can subscribe to this channel

288
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,910
and turn on the channel post notifications

289
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,470
in five seconds.

290
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,303
Are you ready?

291
00:07:23,303 --> 00:07:24,136
Here we go.

292
00:07:24,136 --> 00:07:24,969
Five...

293
00:07:24,969 --> 00:07:25,802
Four...

294
00:07:25,802 --> 00:07:26,776
Three...

295
00:07:26,776 --> 00:07:27,639
Two...

296
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:28,472
One...

297
00:07:28,472 --> 00:07:30,345
Done! If you can do, comment down below.

298
00:07:30,345 --> 00:07:31,178
- Comment down below.

299
00:07:31,178 --> 00:07:32,011
- Keyper squad right now.

300
00:07:32,011 --> 00:07:34,719
And let's see how this crystal egg turned out. Here we go.

301
00:07:34,719 --> 00:07:35,552
- Dude!

302
00:07:35,552 --> 00:07:36,385
Dude! Oooh!

303
00:07:36,385 --> 00:07:37,443
- [Devon] Oooh my gosh!

304
00:07:37,443 --> 00:07:39,019
- [Collins] This is blowing my mind right now,

305
00:07:39,019 --> 00:07:40,509
like I didn't even just, I didn't think this would work.

306
00:07:40,509 --> 00:07:42,082
So I'm like, how are you going to create crystals

307
00:07:42,082 --> 00:07:43,027
around an egg?

308
00:07:43,027 --> 00:07:45,169
- Ooh! Dude! I can hear it like,

309
00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:46,779
clinking against the crystals.

310
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:48,773
- Yo! I knew we saved the best one for last!

311
00:07:48,773 --> 00:07:51,218
That looks so crazy.

312
00:07:51,218 --> 00:07:54,441
The orange ones and the red ones just look the craziest.

313
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:56,473
So we're going to be eating these at the end of the video

314
00:07:56,473 --> 00:07:59,179
to find out how they taste. Do they have flavor to 'em?

315
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:00,561
They may taste disgusting.

316
00:08:00,561 --> 00:08:02,680
Or it may be the best thing of all time.

317
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,842
But right now we are on to the next round.

318
00:08:04,842 --> 00:08:06,375
For this one you challenged us to turn

319
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:07,941
a Rubix cube into candy.

320
00:08:07,941 --> 00:08:09,806
And not just candy, but actually a Rubix cube

321
00:08:09,806 --> 00:08:11,761
you can fill candy with.

322
00:08:11,761 --> 00:08:13,044
(chop)

323
00:08:13,044 --> 00:08:14,496
Whoa! That worked, that was perfect.

324
00:08:14,496 --> 00:08:15,329
(chop) (chop)

325
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:16,162
- Either way

326
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:16,995
- There we go

327
00:08:16,995 --> 00:08:18,024
- [Collins] Oooh! Dude! Very melty!

328
00:08:18,024 --> 00:08:19,977
First, I'm gonna to coat the bottom here with the frosting.

329
00:08:19,977 --> 00:08:22,142
Hopefully that will like, begin to allow the cube

330
00:08:22,142 --> 00:08:23,262
to stick together.

331
00:08:23,262 --> 00:08:24,387
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

332
00:08:24,387 --> 00:08:26,403
No! Dude! You ruined it! - Oooh!

333
00:08:26,403 --> 00:08:27,236
Oh, sorry.

334
00:08:27,236 --> 00:08:28,487
- I'm legitimately not happy with you, Devon.

335
00:08:28,487 --> 00:08:30,257
(Devon laughs evilly) I got to start from the beginning,

336
00:08:30,257 --> 00:08:34,153
because Devon flippin' ruined it, as usual.

337
00:08:34,153 --> 00:08:36,681
The final piece, the top. Oh no, oh no, oh no!

338
00:08:36,681 --> 00:08:38,209
Devon, Devon, Devon! You're kidding me, bro.

339
00:08:38,209 --> 00:08:40,178
Did you turn this off? You're burning the chocolate.

340
00:08:40,178 --> 00:08:42,295
- No, no no no! Why would you... No, no, no no no!

341
00:08:42,295 --> 00:08:43,686
Noooooo!

342
00:08:43,686 --> 00:08:46,391
- Oh, oh, oh, you're kidding. That's like the worst thing

343
00:08:46,391 --> 00:08:47,416
that could have happened.

344
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:49,048
- But I still could have had it... but still... I'm sorry.

345
00:08:49,048 --> 00:08:50,337
- Dude, dude, dude! This is so stupid.

346
00:08:50,337 --> 00:08:51,761
- Oooh!

347
00:08:51,761 --> 00:08:54,030
- We're back now and it's time to complete the Rubix cube.

348
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,522
We've got a whole bunch of Starbursts here.

349
00:08:55,522 --> 00:08:57,753
Per usual, Devon's gonna blow me out of the water with

350
00:08:57,753 --> 00:08:58,586
his incredible masterpiece.

351
00:08:58,586 --> 00:08:59,419
- [Devon] Oh no!

352
00:08:59,419 --> 00:09:00,977
- Yes! (clapping) - No!

353
00:09:00,977 --> 00:09:02,126
Why?

354
00:09:02,126 --> 00:09:03,476
- Okay, here it is. The big reveal.

355
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:04,309
Three..

356
00:09:04,309 --> 00:09:05,142
Two...

357
00:09:05,142 --> 00:09:06,808
One.. But first, 3 Second Lightning Challenge!

358
00:09:06,808 --> 00:09:09,565
We want to see if you can like this video in three seconds.

359
00:09:09,565 --> 00:09:10,398
You're ready? Here we go.

360
00:09:10,398 --> 00:09:11,231
Three...

361
00:09:11,231 --> 00:09:12,064
Two...

362
00:09:12,064 --> 00:09:12,897
One...

363
00:09:12,897 --> 00:09:13,730
Done!

364
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:14,563
Alright, here we go!

365
00:09:14,563 --> 00:09:15,764
Ta-Dah! It looks terrible!

366
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:19,094
Devon's would have been amazing. But mine, is gonna taste

367
00:09:19,094 --> 00:09:20,476
amazing, but looks terrible.

368
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:23,161
So now it's time to taste all of these edible objects,

369
00:09:23,161 --> 00:09:26,058
starting with the egg, ending with the egg crystals.

370
00:09:26,058 --> 00:09:28,348
Yo, it like, it feels a weird slimy.

371
00:09:28,348 --> 00:09:29,275
Kinda reach in there and give just,

372
00:09:29,275 --> 00:09:30,571
you just give it a good ol' fuh-woop!

373
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:32,896
- Oooh! This feels weird!

374
00:09:32,896 --> 00:09:35,151
- I see the yolk moving inside.

375
00:09:35,151 --> 00:09:36,906
- This seems like it's gonna taste really gross.

376
00:09:36,906 --> 00:09:38,869
- Yeah, I'm with you. Here we go. Three, cheers...

377
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:39,702
Two...

378
00:09:39,702 --> 00:09:41,110
One...

379
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:41,943
(pop) (splashing)

380
00:09:41,943 --> 00:09:43,434
(screeching)

381
00:09:43,434 --> 00:09:44,706
It popped all over me!

382
00:09:44,706 --> 00:09:45,663
Oh, that was disgusting!

383
00:09:45,663 --> 00:09:46,496
Oh, terrible!

384
00:09:46,496 --> 00:09:48,646
Alright well, hopefully to counteract the taste of that

385
00:09:48,646 --> 00:09:51,533
disgusting vinegar egg, we're gonna try the liquid glass.

386
00:09:51,533 --> 00:09:52,604
- Should I try to break it again?

387
00:09:52,604 --> 00:09:53,962
- Try to take a bite of it, bro.

388
00:09:53,962 --> 00:09:55,630
- It's like it melted, yo!

389
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:56,463
- Oh, melted!

390
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:57,554
- It's like, not even liquid glass anymore.

391
00:09:57,554 --> 00:09:58,387
- No!

392
00:09:59,803 --> 00:10:01,696
- Whoa, what is happening with the liquid glass?

393
00:10:01,696 --> 00:10:04,624
I'm gonna bite it here we go, three, two, one!

394
00:10:04,624 --> 00:10:05,457
- Wow!

395
00:10:05,457 --> 00:10:06,290
- Bro!

396
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:07,123
- Whoa!

397
00:10:07,123 --> 00:10:07,956
- Mmmm!

398
00:10:07,956 --> 00:10:09,860
- It's gonna stay in my mouth forever! It's so sticky! Mmmm!

399
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,873
- Liquid Glass gets two thumbs up from me!

400
00:10:11,873 --> 00:10:13,498
And now, Devon, time to eat the Play-Doh.

401
00:10:13,498 --> 00:10:14,706
- Oh, okay!

402
00:10:14,706 --> 00:10:15,864
- Three, two, one.

403
00:10:15,864 --> 00:10:16,697
(chomp)

404
00:10:16,697 --> 00:10:17,530
- How is it?

405
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:18,363
- It's so weird!

406
00:10:18,363 --> 00:10:19,490
(panting)

407
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:20,323
(chomp)

408
00:10:20,323 --> 00:10:21,597
Oh my gosh, that was disgusting!

409
00:10:21,597 --> 00:10:22,430
- Ahhh!

410
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:23,564
- Now, wonder if I can solve my Rubix cube.

411
00:10:23,564 --> 00:10:27,231
- Ahh, Skittles, oh Skittles, oh? In heaven.

412
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,173
- Let's go find a layer,

413
00:10:29,173 --> 00:10:31,886
one with the chocolates, or Rubix cube.

414
00:10:31,886 --> 00:10:32,719
There's vinegar on it.

415
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:34,303
The egg, like, blew up all over it.

416
00:10:34,303 --> 00:10:35,329
- Oh, so gross!

417
00:10:35,329 --> 00:10:36,910
- Okay, the final thing here, guys.

418
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,939
Before we eat this next one, I wanted to tell you

419
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:42,128
how you can win an iPhone X, 10 $500 gift cards,

420
00:10:42,128 --> 00:10:44,253
and a whole bunch of other crazy prizes.

421
00:10:44,253 --> 00:10:46,366
I've actually partnered up with Kwai for this video,

422
00:10:46,366 --> 00:10:47,697
and also for this giveaway.

423
00:10:47,697 --> 00:10:50,018
So, huge shout-out to Kwai for making this all possible.

424
00:10:50,018 --> 00:10:52,285
And if you guys want to win that iPhone X,

425
00:10:52,285 --> 00:10:54,039
or those gift cards, all you have to do is,

426
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:56,864
number one, download the Kwai app. The link is down

427
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:57,698
and the description below.

428
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:59,489
And trust me the app is super fun.

429
00:10:59,489 --> 00:11:00,398
I've been playing around on it.

430
00:11:00,398 --> 00:11:02,462
And rule number two, you gotta follow me on the app.

431
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:04,569
And if you go comment on one of my videos,

432
00:11:04,569 --> 00:11:06,303
saying you came from this YouTube video,

433
00:11:06,303 --> 00:11:07,625
I'll be commenting back to you.

434
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,473
And rule number three, is you have to post a video on Kwai

435
00:11:10,473 --> 00:11:13,193
of you taking part in the LicketySplit Challenge.

436
00:11:13,193 --> 00:11:15,310
So it's super easy. Just get yourself, a friend,

437
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:18,440
and try to eat a food as fast as you possibly can.

438
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,247
Now, you have to be safe with this, but go crazy, have fun.

439
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:25,726
And then post that video on Kwai with #LicketySplitChallenge

440
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:27,655
Now, if you do that you will automatically be entered

441
00:11:27,655 --> 00:11:29,436
into the giveaway and have a chance of winning

442
00:11:29,436 --> 00:11:33,289

00:11:34,972 --> 00:11:35,805
Those are the rules.

445
00:11:35,805 --> 00:11:37,396
And right now the moment you've all been waiting for.

446
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:39,517
Let's try these eggs. I'm going to take off a piece of

447
00:11:39,517 --> 00:11:40,350
these crystals here.

448
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,183
- Dude!

449
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,016
- You're just gonna go for the whole thing?

450
00:11:42,016 --> 00:11:42,849
- Yeah, bro!

451
00:11:42,849 --> 00:11:44,013
- Three... Two... One...

452
00:11:44,013 --> 00:11:46,346
(crunching)

453
00:11:47,309 --> 00:11:48,142
(coughing)

454
00:11:48,142 --> 00:11:48,975
(screeching)

455
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:50,791
Ooh! It burns! It burns so bad!

456
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:53,905
It burns! It burns! It burns! It burns!

457
00:11:53,905 --> 00:11:54,738
(coughing)

458
00:11:54,738 --> 00:11:57,007
Oh my gosh guys, five seconds to burn here!

459
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:57,840
Five...

460
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,673
Four...

461
00:11:58,673 --> 00:11:59,914
Three... Two...

462
00:11:59,914 --> 00:12:00,930
One... Done!

463
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:01,763
Oh my gosh!

464
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:03,428
Alright guys! I love you guys so much!

465
00:12:03,428 --> 00:12:04,261
- So hot!

466
00:12:04,261 --> 00:12:05,387
- Oh see you! Bye!
