00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,309
What's up, it's Collins Key,

2
00:00:01,309 --> 00:00:03,120
and welcome to my brand new life hack video,

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,501
and for this video, to follow along,

4
00:00:04,501 --> 00:00:07,288
all you're gonna need is just a soda can and a quarter,

5
00:00:07,288 --> 00:00:08,994
and I've actually signed my quarter on both sides

6
00:00:08,994 --> 00:00:10,724
so you guys know this is the exact same quarter

7
00:00:10,724 --> 00:00:12,071
throughout my entire life hack.

8
00:00:12,071 --> 00:00:13,046
And what you're going to do,

9
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:14,904
just start tapping your quarter on your soda can,

10
00:00:14,904 --> 00:00:16,947
you're looking for a soft spot.

11
00:00:16,947 --> 00:00:19,200
Doesn't make sense...

12
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,498
But right there. Yeah, that's it.

13
00:00:21,498 --> 00:00:23,325
So check this out, if I take this quarter right here,

14
00:00:23,325 --> 00:00:26,742
and look at this, we go, one, two, three.

15
00:00:28,756 --> 00:00:29,856
Looks pretty crazy, right?

16
00:00:29,856 --> 00:00:31,493
And check this out, from the outside you can't even tell

17
00:00:31,493 --> 00:00:33,455
that anything's happening, the outside is totally fine.

18
00:00:33,455 --> 00:00:34,605
Even the bottom,

19
00:00:34,605 --> 00:00:36,838
you can't tell that anything just happened on the bottom,

20
00:00:36,838 --> 00:00:39,504
and the top of course is still factory-sealed

21
00:00:39,504 --> 00:00:40,337
but this is where it's crazy.

22
00:00:40,337 --> 00:00:42,537
Because if you take your can and if you shake it,

23
00:00:42,537 --> 00:00:43,939
I don't know if you can hear that, but listen to this.

24
00:00:43,939 --> 00:00:46,751
(can rattling)

25
00:00:46,751 --> 00:00:47,584
Now, I just shook it out

26
00:00:47,584 --> 00:00:48,481
so I don't want to splash you guys at all,

27
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:49,886
but check this out, if I take, if I open up here,

28
00:00:49,886 --> 00:00:50,969
oh my gosh...

29
00:00:51,914 --> 00:00:52,747
Let's see.

30
00:00:53,876 --> 00:00:55,722
I actually brought along a cup right here,

31
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,022
we'll just dump it out.

32
00:00:57,022 --> 00:00:59,356
(soda pouring into can)

33
00:00:59,356 --> 00:01:00,939
And check this out.

34
00:01:05,602 --> 00:01:08,529
(can rattling)

35
00:01:08,529 --> 00:01:09,612
Look at this.

36
00:01:10,812 --> 00:01:11,682
I want you guys to see, check it out.

37
00:01:11,682 --> 00:01:14,097
You guys can see right there, you guys can see the quarter

38
00:01:14,097 --> 00:01:15,734
with the signature on it.

39
00:01:15,734 --> 00:01:17,627
So, this life hack right now blew your mind.

40
00:01:17,627 --> 00:01:18,660
If you can't wait to try this out,

41
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,597
make you guys share it with your friends right now,

42
00:01:20,597 --> 00:01:21,934
and also give this video a big thumbs up

43
00:01:21,934 --> 00:01:23,536
if you want me to do even more crazy life hacks

44
00:01:23,536 --> 00:01:24,639
like this in the future.

45
00:01:24,639 --> 00:01:25,580

46
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,588

47
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:30,491
