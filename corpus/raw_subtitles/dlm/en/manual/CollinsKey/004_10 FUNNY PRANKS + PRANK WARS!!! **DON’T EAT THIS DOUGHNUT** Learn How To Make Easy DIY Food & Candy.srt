1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,833
- Hey bro, want some chips?

2
00:00:00,833 --> 00:00:02,009
- Yeah, for sure.

3
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:03,675
(scream) (laughing)

4
00:00:03,675 --> 00:00:04,508
Bro!

5
00:00:04,508 --> 00:00:06,162
- Bro, I'm sorry, I got you this

6
00:00:06,162 --> 00:00:07,142
this chocolate cake pop.

7
00:00:07,142 --> 00:00:07,975
- Oh cool, thanks.

8
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:08,824
- Yeah.

9
00:00:08,824 --> 00:00:10,542
(crunching)

10
00:00:10,542 --> 00:00:12,341
- Oh, wait, what? (clapping)

11
00:00:12,341 --> 00:00:13,174
(laughing)

12
00:00:13,174 --> 00:00:14,007
(ding ding ding) - It's Brussels sprouts

13
00:00:14,007 --> 00:00:15,827
covered in chocolate. - What?

14
00:00:15,827 --> 00:00:17,110
- So guys, right now,

15
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:17,943
we're gonna teach you

16
00:00:17,943 --> 00:00:20,325
how to make this so that way you can do this to everyone.

17
00:00:20,325 --> 00:00:21,158
- Ew.

18
00:00:21,158 --> 00:00:22,908
First we gotta use some olive oil spray.

19
00:00:22,908 --> 00:00:25,893
- I wonder how this tastes. Use my spatula.

20
00:00:25,893 --> 00:00:26,876
(dramatic noise)

21
00:00:26,876 --> 00:00:27,709
- It's really good, huh?

22
00:00:27,709 --> 00:00:28,542
- Oh, man.

23
00:00:28,542 --> 00:00:29,375
(grossed out noise)

24
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:30,676
You gotta pop open this chocolate.

25
00:00:30,676 --> 00:00:32,114
First, the Collins test.

26
00:00:32,114 --> 00:00:32,947
- What, you just pranked me

27
00:00:32,947 --> 00:00:34,197
and now you get to have a ton of chocolate?

28
00:00:35,187 --> 00:00:36,020
- Uh huh.

29
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:36,853
Okay this stuff is good. (ding)

30
00:00:36,853 --> 00:00:39,469
And now we're gonna add the chocolate in.

31
00:00:39,469 --> 00:00:41,236
Wooh that's a lot of chocolate.

32
00:00:41,236 --> 00:00:42,069
- [Devin] Dude, it's starting to melt.

33
00:00:42,069 --> 00:00:43,189
- [Both] Ooh!

34
00:00:43,189 --> 00:00:44,722
- At this moment, I'm really regretting the decision

35
00:00:44,722 --> 00:00:46,072
to put brussel sprouts in here 'cause like,

36
00:00:46,072 --> 00:00:48,291
imagine just dipping like strawberries,

37
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:49,492
and like other delicious foods.

38
00:00:49,492 --> 00:00:51,184
Oh my God, this stuff is...

39
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:52,017
- Bro this is going quick.

40
00:00:52,017 --> 00:00:53,875
- This is melting super quick.

41
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:54,791
We're turning off the heat

42
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:56,108
'cause the last thing we want to do

43
00:00:56,108 --> 00:00:57,833
is roast our chocolate and burn it.

44
00:00:57,833 --> 00:00:58,666
- We also wanna save the pot so

45
00:00:58,666 --> 00:00:59,619
- Oh yeah, yeah.

46
00:00:59,619 --> 00:01:01,185
- We've kinda ruined a lot of pots.

47
00:01:01,185 --> 00:01:02,018
- We ruined a lot of pots.

48
00:01:02,018 --> 00:01:02,851
- Sorry, Mom.

49
00:01:02,851 --> 00:01:03,684
As you're mixing that,

50
00:01:03,684 --> 00:01:05,139
I'm gonna be in charge of getting

51
00:01:05,139 --> 00:01:07,139
these brussel sprouts on some skewers.

52
00:01:07,139 --> 00:01:08,725
- Let's chocolate this sprout.

53
00:01:08,725 --> 00:01:09,741
- [All] Boom!

54
00:01:09,741 --> 00:01:10,987
- That looks cool.

55
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:12,486
If I didn't know this was a brussel sprout,

56
00:01:12,486 --> 00:01:13,319
which Devin clearly didn't,

57
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:15,653
this looks really, really good.

58
00:01:15,653 --> 00:01:18,177
So right now I'm gonna pop it in the freezer.

59
00:01:18,177 --> 00:01:19,701
Oh no, losing some chocolate. - What?

60
00:01:19,701 --> 00:01:20,959
- I need all the chocolate I can get.

61
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:23,405
And then I'm gonna try and eat it and to see how it tastes.

62
00:01:23,405 --> 00:01:24,238
It's finally frozen,

63
00:01:24,238 --> 00:01:25,888
and I've realized I don't wanna eat it.

64
00:01:25,888 --> 00:01:26,721
- Wait, what?

65
00:01:26,721 --> 00:01:27,554
- I don't wanna.

66
00:01:27,554 --> 00:01:28,387
It looks disgusting - Bro you agreed to do it.

67
00:01:28,387 --> 00:01:29,220
You have to do it.

68
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,053
(frustrated groan)

69
00:01:30,053 --> 00:01:30,886
You pranked me twice, bro.

70
00:01:30,886 --> 00:01:31,852
- Okay, fine I'll eat it.

71
00:01:31,852 --> 00:01:32,685
And just wanna let you know, Devin,

72
00:01:32,685 --> 00:01:35,853
I have right here, the box of mystery.

73
00:01:35,853 --> 00:01:36,686
- Okay.

74
00:01:36,686 --> 00:01:37,519
- And inside the box of mystery,

75
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:40,194
I've got the craziest prank of all time,

76
00:01:40,194 --> 00:01:41,667
and we're not gonna do it right now.

77
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:42,780
We're gonna do this at the end of the video.

78
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:43,613
- Oh no.

79
00:01:43,613 --> 00:01:45,798
- It may look all pink and nice and happy, but trust me,

80
00:01:45,798 --> 00:01:46,631
it's terrible.

81
00:01:46,631 --> 00:01:48,564
Time for me to eat a brussel sprout.

82
00:01:48,564 --> 00:01:49,397
Brussels.

83
00:01:49,397 --> 00:01:50,813
- No, no. - Uh huh, uh huh.

84
00:01:50,813 --> 00:01:51,897
- You can't do that. - What?

85
00:01:51,897 --> 00:01:52,730
- You have to bite into it.

86
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:53,729
- I am. (beep)

87
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:55,812
- [Both] Three, two, one.

88
00:01:57,537 --> 00:01:58,531
(cracking)

89
00:01:58,531 --> 00:01:59,896
- No! (laughing)

90
00:01:59,896 --> 00:02:00,729
How?

91
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:02,087
You're like the luckiest person ever.

92
00:02:02,087 --> 00:02:02,920
- Woohoo!

93
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,753
- You cannot get off that easy.

94
00:02:03,753 --> 00:02:06,616
You have to eat the brussel sprout now, bro.

95
00:02:06,616 --> 00:02:09,351
And you know what, I'm actually taking off the rest

96
00:02:09,351 --> 00:02:10,184
of the chocolate sprout.

97
00:02:10,184 --> 00:02:11,552
- No, it's just a brussel sprout.

98
00:02:11,552 --> 00:02:13,062
Oh man, I'm not looking forward to this.

99
00:02:13,062 --> 00:02:15,145
- [Both] Three, two, one.

100
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:19,512
(crunching)

101
00:02:20,744 --> 00:02:21,577
(Devin laughs)

102
00:02:21,577 --> 00:02:22,908
- Holy cow.

103
00:02:22,908 --> 00:02:24,381
- Your breath is gonna smell so bad.

104
00:02:24,381 --> 00:02:26,739
(crying)

105
00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:28,305
Let's go.

106
00:02:28,305 --> 00:02:29,930
- All right Collins, I feel super bad

107
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:32,037
for making you eat this uncooked brussel sprout.

108
00:02:32,037 --> 00:02:32,895
- It was terrible.

109
00:02:32,895 --> 00:02:35,064
- So, I got you a little gift, here.

110
00:02:35,064 --> 00:02:37,188
- Wait a second, bro, I am super suspicious

111
00:02:37,188 --> 00:02:38,251
of anything you give me,

112
00:02:38,251 --> 00:02:39,448
especially during this video.

113
00:02:39,448 --> 00:02:40,314
- What, why?

114
00:02:40,314 --> 00:02:41,147
- [Collinw] What is that?

115
00:02:41,147 --> 00:02:42,654
- [Devin] Whoa, chill out, it's just jelly, dude.

116
00:02:42,654 --> 00:02:44,149
- You're sure that's just jelly?

117
00:02:44,149 --> 00:02:45,884
- Yeah, dude it looks like jelly, right?

118
00:02:45,884 --> 00:02:47,257
- All right.

119
00:02:47,257 --> 00:02:49,715
(screaming)

120
00:02:49,715 --> 00:02:52,697
- It's Sriracha sauce, eh. (ding ding ding)

121
00:02:52,697 --> 00:02:54,794
(Collin yelling)

122
00:02:54,794 --> 00:02:55,627
- The thing about this is like,

123
00:02:55,627 --> 00:02:57,766
It tastes so good at first, you just taste the donut

124
00:02:57,766 --> 00:02:59,032
and the glaze, and then it's like,

125
00:02:59,032 --> 00:02:59,924
Waboom!

126
00:02:59,924 --> 00:03:01,086
Tastebuds are on fire.

127
00:03:01,086 --> 00:03:02,244
How do you do this prank?

128
00:03:02,244 --> 00:03:03,077
- So we use this here.

129
00:03:03,077 --> 00:03:05,241
We fill it up with sriracha sauce,

130
00:03:05,241 --> 00:03:06,074
dip it in like this

131
00:03:06,074 --> 00:03:07,747
then you extract some sriracha sauce.

132
00:03:07,747 --> 00:03:08,580
- Oh, okay here we go,

133
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,655
let me do the same thing.

134
00:03:09,655 --> 00:03:11,155
- Yo! - Get your sriracha sauce.

135
00:03:11,155 --> 00:03:12,493
- [Collins] Okay, cool, I got a ton of sriracha sauce.

136
00:03:12,493 --> 00:03:13,896
- [Devin] I'm just going in right over here.

137
00:03:13,896 --> 00:03:15,029
- [Collins] And then just kinda like push it in like this?

138
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:16,112
- [Devin] Yep, you just push it in.

139
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:17,228
- It like goes right in.

140
00:03:17,228 --> 00:03:18,061
- Bro.

141
00:03:18,061 --> 00:03:19,923
- Why would you use sriracha sauce, Devin?

142
00:03:19,923 --> 00:03:22,065
- Why, I didn't, I made a jelly one just for me.

143
00:03:22,065 --> 00:03:23,735
Oh no, I got some sriracha on my finger.

144
00:03:23,735 --> 00:03:24,718
Okay, wait, real quick.

145
00:03:24,718 --> 00:03:25,551
Just gonna switch the jelly one

146
00:03:25,551 --> 00:03:27,217
with the sriracha one and I need to wipe off my...

147
00:03:27,217 --> 00:03:28,050
(screams) - Bro, why would you do that?

148
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,345
(pop)

149
00:03:29,345 --> 00:03:30,622
- Ya gotta go get your paper towels, man.

150
00:03:30,622 --> 00:03:31,539
- Ah, okay.

151
00:03:34,755 --> 00:03:35,730
(pop)

152
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:37,000
- Ya get it? - Yeah, I got 'em.

153
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,833
- All right, cool.

154
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:38,924
Now that you've got your hands cleaned off

155
00:03:38,924 --> 00:03:39,757
let's do a little taste test right now.

156
00:03:39,757 --> 00:03:40,590
- Alright.

157
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,814
- And your can try your jelly one

158
00:03:41,814 --> 00:03:43,151
and I'll eat my sriracha sauce one again, okay?

159
00:03:43,151 --> 00:03:43,984
- Awesome, let's do it.

160
00:03:43,984 --> 00:03:44,817

Why, why would you do this?

(scream)

180
00:04:16,369 --> 00:04:18,977
It's so hot, oh no, no.

181
00:04:18,977 --> 00:04:19,810
Water.

182
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,928

00:04:24,201 --> 00:04:26,362
just destroying him, and what I'm gonna do is

185
00:04:26,362 --> 00:04:27,965
I actually stole his toothbrush.

186
00:04:27,965 --> 00:04:29,520
I'm gonna put some food coloring on it.

187
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,045
That way when he goes to brush his teeth

188
00:04:31,045 --> 00:04:32,939
it'll like stain his teeth rainbow.

189
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,345
Alright, so I'm gonna start off with blue

190
00:04:34,345 --> 00:04:36,516
- [Devin] Hey, Collin, have you seen my toothbrush?

191
00:04:36,516 --> 00:04:38,559
- No, I haven't, why?

192
00:04:38,559 --> 00:04:40,723
- [Devin] I don't know, I can't find it.

193
00:04:40,723 --> 00:04:42,622
- Well I'd keep looking, like check the drawers.

194
00:04:42,622 --> 00:04:43,627
*whispering* I gotta go fast.

195
00:04:43,627 --> 00:04:44,828
- [Devin] Bro, it's really not anywhere.

196
00:04:44,828 --> 00:04:46,331
- It's actually, it's over here on the table.

197
00:04:46,331 --> 00:04:47,164
- [Devin] Why is it on the table?

198
00:04:47,164 --> 00:04:48,763
Okay, great. - Yep.

199
00:04:48,763 --> 00:04:49,596
- Thanks.

200
00:04:49,596 --> 00:04:50,729
- Here, ya wanna sit down, there's some toothpaste

201
00:04:50,729 --> 00:04:51,860
over here, too. - Oh.

202
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:52,693
- I had it set before the video

203
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:54,159
in case we need to, you know, brush our teeth, so, here.

204
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:55,309
- It's not really interesting

205
00:04:55,309 --> 00:04:56,142
to see me brush my teeth, bro.

206
00:04:56,142 --> 00:04:56,975
- It actually is,

207
00:04:56,975 --> 00:04:58,029
bam, alright, there ya go.

208
00:04:58,029 --> 00:04:58,887
- Alright, gonna go brush my teeth.

209
00:04:58,887 --> 00:04:59,720
- No, no, no, no.

210
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,553
Stay in here, cause we gotta

211
00:05:00,553 --> 00:05:01,386
do one other thing, first.

212
00:05:01,386 --> 00:05:02,371
You need to start brushing your teeth.

213
00:05:02,371 --> 00:05:04,470
We got water right there.

214
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,303
- What?

215
00:05:05,303 --> 00:05:06,661
- You gotta stay hydrated, you can start brushing.

216
00:05:06,661 --> 00:05:07,494
- All right.

217
00:05:07,494 --> 00:05:08,327
- Here's what we're gonna do guys

218
00:05:08,327 --> 00:05:10,049
(laughing)

219
00:05:10,049 --> 00:05:10,882
Bro, look at it

220
00:05:10,882 --> 00:05:12,453
(scream) (laughing)

221
00:05:12,453 --> 00:05:13,286
- Wait, why?

222
00:05:13,286 --> 00:05:14,319
What did you do to me?

223
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:15,152
- Your teeth are all rainbow.

224
00:05:15,152 --> 00:05:16,557
There's food dye in the toothbrush.

225
00:05:16,557 --> 00:05:17,615
- Bro really?

226
00:05:17,615 --> 00:05:19,040
- Moving on, before we do this next one,

227
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,180
I just gotta just, my lips are kinda chapped.

228
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,013
- Oh, okay, cool.

229
00:05:21,013 --> 00:05:21,846
- Almost.

230
00:05:21,846 --> 00:05:22,679
- Bro, let's go.

231
00:05:22,679 --> 00:05:23,812
It's not looking like it's really working

232
00:05:23,812 --> 00:05:25,568
Bro, what are you doing?

233
00:05:25,568 --> 00:05:26,401
- Huh?

234
00:05:26,401 --> 00:05:27,234
- Bro, that's chapstick.

235
00:05:27,234 --> 00:05:28,650
Bro, what are you doing?

236
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,268
You don't do that with chapstick.

237
00:05:30,268 --> 00:05:31,101
- Mmmmmm

238
00:05:31,101 --> 00:05:32,023
- Oh, that's so gross.

239
00:05:32,023 --> 00:05:32,856
- Oh, sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

240
00:05:32,856 --> 00:05:33,689
This is white chocolate, you melt down

241
00:05:33,689 --> 00:05:35,418
and put in a chapstick - What?

242
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:36,626
So we're gonna teach you how

243
00:05:36,626 --> 00:05:37,459
to freak out your friends with this

244
00:05:37,459 --> 00:05:38,292
because it's really fun,

245
00:05:38,292 --> 00:05:39,125
but they will have no idea.

246
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:40,504
They'll think you're just like, eating chapstick.

247
00:05:40,504 --> 00:05:41,337
Which is really gross. - Yeah.

248
00:05:41,337 --> 00:05:42,170
This is what I call

249
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,262
the Long Shot, shot, Shot.

250
00:05:43,262 --> 00:05:44,854
Shot!

251
00:05:44,854 --> 00:05:46,012
(scream)

252
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,752
Now, time to melt this down.

253
00:05:47,752 --> 00:05:48,802
- Oh no, it's starting to burn.

254
00:05:48,802 --> 00:05:49,797
- All right, well luckily we got the chapstick.

255
00:05:49,797 --> 00:05:50,715
It's not ready yet.

256
00:05:50,715 --> 00:05:51,548
- What?

257
00:05:51,548 --> 00:05:52,381
- No, no, no, no, no - What?

258
00:05:52,381 --> 00:05:53,214
- I need to twist it out.

259
00:05:53,214 --> 00:05:54,047
Dude, twist, twist, twist.

260
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,522
- I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.

261
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,480
(chomp)

262
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,313
(scream)

263
00:05:58,313 --> 00:05:59,146
Holy cow! Don't do that.

264
00:05:59,146 --> 00:06:00,192
Don't do that! Don't do that!

265
00:06:00,192 --> 00:06:01,292
- I got it, I got it.

266
00:06:01,292 --> 00:06:02,616
It's done. It's done.

267
00:06:02,616 --> 00:06:03,449
(yelling)

268
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:04,282
- Dude it's burnt!

269
00:06:04,282 --> 00:06:05,457
(screaming) We burnt the chocolate!

270
00:06:05,457 --> 00:06:06,290
Oh no!

271
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:08,601
How do you burn chocolate?

272
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:09,776
I guess now it's no longer white chocolate.

273
00:06:09,776 --> 00:06:10,717
It's now dark chocolate.

274
00:06:10,717 --> 00:06:11,992
You're gonna put this like this.

275
00:06:11,992 --> 00:06:12,842
- Ew!

276
00:06:12,842 --> 00:06:14,675
Holy cow, I think we messed it up.

277
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:16,116
- You're not gonna fool anybody with this.

278
00:06:16,116 --> 00:06:16,949
- Let me see how this tastes.

279
00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:18,329
Ow, it's hot, it's hot.

280
00:06:18,329 --> 00:06:19,162
- It is?

281
00:06:19,162 --> 00:06:19,995
- All right guys this did not work,

282
00:06:19,995 --> 00:06:20,828
this is kinda a fail.

283
00:06:20,828 --> 00:06:22,949
So, we are on to the next round.

284
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:23,865
But trust me, it does work.

285
00:06:23,865 --> 00:06:24,698
Just don't burn your chocolate.

286
00:06:24,698 --> 00:06:25,631
(alarm)

287
00:06:25,631 --> 00:06:27,197
- Alright, Collin, I made us

288
00:06:27,197 --> 00:06:28,030
a nice Gatorade drink for our

289
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,388
break right now. - Thank you.

290
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:30,329
I appreciate it. - You're welcome.

291
00:06:30,329 --> 00:06:31,162
That's so nice,

292
00:06:31,162 --> 00:06:32,220
I feel like it's gonna be a prank, though.

293
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,220
- Wait, why?

294
00:06:34,999 --> 00:06:36,193
- Mmmmm, Bro it is so good

295
00:06:36,193 --> 00:06:37,026
- I can't get any.

296
00:06:37,026 --> 00:06:38,392
What is this?

297
00:06:38,392 --> 00:06:39,778
- Bro, it's Jello.

298
00:06:39,778 --> 00:06:41,878
(cheering)

299
00:06:41,878 --> 00:06:42,711
- Oh!

300
00:06:42,711 --> 00:06:43,544
- I thought it was the jiggling juice,

301
00:06:43,544 --> 00:06:44,786
but it's really the Jello.

302
00:06:44,786 --> 00:06:46,337
So for this prank, all you're gonna need is some Jello.

303
00:06:46,337 --> 00:06:47,170
catch it Devin.

304
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,003
Catch it. - I got it, I got it.

305
00:06:48,003 --> 00:06:48,836
- Good catch.

306
00:06:48,836 --> 00:06:50,651
Some more Jello, the red kind as well.

307
00:06:50,651 --> 00:06:52,076
And then you're gonna need some olive oil.

308
00:06:52,076 --> 00:06:52,909
Sike.

309
00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:55,028
So we're gonna add one cup of water to the hotplate.

310
00:06:55,028 --> 00:06:56,544
Sizzle, sizzle.

311
00:06:56,544 --> 00:06:58,604
We have to get the water boiling so we gotta turn it on.

312
00:06:58,604 --> 00:06:59,437
Roast it.

313
00:06:59,437 --> 00:07:00,682
Quickly, Devin add it, it's boiling.

314
00:07:00,682 --> 00:07:02,065
- It's time to add the Jello too.

315
00:07:02,065 --> 00:07:04,142
- All right, this smells actually delicious right now.

316
00:07:04,142 --> 00:07:05,541
- This smells so good right now.

317
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:06,616
- So I guess we just gotta kind of mix it up

318
00:07:06,616 --> 00:07:08,175
until it emulsifies.

319
00:07:08,175 --> 00:07:09,008
- Nice.

320
00:07:09,008 --> 00:07:10,276
- I don't know if that's the right...

321
00:07:10,276 --> 00:07:11,397
Please check the definition on that.

322
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:13,283
All right, then we turn off the hot plate.

323
00:07:13,283 --> 00:07:14,216
Just gonna pour it in.

324
00:07:14,216 --> 00:07:15,049
- I'm so scared right now.

325
00:07:15,049 --> 00:07:16,311
Don't miss.

326
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:17,678
(cheering)

327
00:07:17,678 --> 00:07:18,511
- That was crazy cool.

328
00:07:18,511 --> 00:07:19,839
- Oh, a little bit spilled.

329
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,761
- Fill the rest up with cold water.

330
00:07:21,761 --> 00:07:22,594
- All right.

331
00:07:22,594 --> 00:07:23,580
- Then, now, we have fun straws.

332
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,413
- Yay.

333
00:07:24,413 --> 00:07:25,796
- I'm gonna stretch all fun straws at once.

334
00:07:25,796 --> 00:07:26,629
- Why?

335
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:27,462
- 3, 2, 1.

336
00:07:27,462 --> 00:07:28,910
(crackling)

337
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:29,743
- That was no where near as satisfying

338
00:07:29,743 --> 00:07:30,577
as I thought it would be.

339
00:07:30,577 --> 00:07:31,885
- Well, these fun straws aren't fun.

340
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:34,331
So now, next step is we gotta pop this is the fridge.

341
00:07:34,331 --> 00:07:35,164
- What? (laughing)

342
00:07:35,164 --> 00:07:37,155
Oh, that's hot, okay, cool, here we go.

343
00:07:37,155 --> 00:07:37,988
(ding)

344
00:07:37,988 --> 00:07:39,161
- [Narrator] Eventually...

345
00:07:39,161 --> 00:07:40,943
All right, guys it's finally done

346
00:07:40,943 --> 00:07:42,024
and this looks crazy.

347
00:07:42,024 --> 00:07:43,475
But first, I wanna pull the straw out.

348
00:07:43,475 --> 00:07:44,808
Yo, it's like pulling out

349
00:07:44,808 --> 00:07:45,941
a giant chunk of Jello with it.

350
00:07:45,941 --> 00:07:46,774
I wanna try this.

351
00:07:46,774 --> 00:07:48,293
That was awesome!

352
00:07:48,293 --> 00:07:50,250
It's like a straw filled with Jello.

353
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,600
Let's see how this thing tastes.

354
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,433
- 3, 2, 1.

355
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:54,458
- [Both] Mmmm

356
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:56,488
- All right Collins, I've got some donuts.

357
00:07:56,488 --> 00:07:57,321
- Yo, donuts!

358
00:07:57,321 --> 00:07:58,354
Wait a minute. - Yeah.

359
00:07:58,354 --> 00:07:59,187
- Hold up, hold up, hold up,

360
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,339
I know what you're thinking.

361
00:08:00,339 --> 00:08:01,172
That these are bad donuts,

362
00:08:01,172 --> 00:08:02,027
and I'm about to prank you,

363
00:08:02,027 --> 00:08:03,568
but no, these are both delicious

364
00:08:03,568 --> 00:08:05,460
and as a vote of confidence for you,

365
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,695
I'll eat one with you.

366
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:08,337
- Okay, I do not like this bro.

367
00:08:08,337 --> 00:08:09,170
All right, you ready?

368
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:10,003
- I'm ready.

369
00:08:10,003 --> 00:08:11,403
- Actually, ya know what, I want yours.

370
00:08:11,403 --> 00:08:13,076
Cause I'm sure if there was a prank, here we go,

371
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:13,909
- What? - I want yours.

372
00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:14,742
- Okay

373
00:08:14,742 --> 00:08:15,575
- All right, ya ready? - [Both] 3, 2, 1

374
00:08:15,575 --> 00:08:17,220
- Wait, wait, first,

375
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,166
three second like challenge.

376
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:20,566
If you like this video in three seconds,

377
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:21,399
here we go, ya ready?

378
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:22,232
- [Both] Three,

379
00:08:22,232 --> 00:08:23,065
two,

380
00:08:23,065 --> 00:08:23,898
one,

381
00:08:23,898 --> 00:08:24,882
done.

382
00:08:24,882 --> 00:08:26,197
This kinda has a funny smell to it.

383
00:08:26,197 --> 00:08:27,343
- It's just powdered sugar bro.

384
00:08:27,343 --> 00:08:29,663
- All right, here we go, 3, 2, 1.

385
00:08:29,663 --> 00:08:31,765
- All right, let's do it.

386
00:08:31,765 --> 00:08:33,040
(screaming)

387
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,707
What, what happened?

388
00:08:35,735 --> 00:08:36,915
- Baby powder.

389
00:08:36,915 --> 00:08:37,748
- Yean it is.

390
00:08:37,748 --> 00:08:38,581
- He gave me baby powder.

391
00:08:38,581 --> 00:08:39,414
- Yeah, it is.

392
00:08:39,414 --> 00:08:40,247
- That is not good.

393
00:08:40,247 --> 00:08:41,246
- Oh, yeah it is.

394
00:08:41,246 --> 00:08:42,096
(screaming)

395
00:08:42,096 --> 00:08:42,929
- Yeah

396
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:44,120
- That's the whole prank,

397
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,029
just like baby powder on donuts.

398
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:45,862
- Yep, That's it.

399
00:08:45,862 --> 00:08:46,695
- Alright, let's go to the next one.

400
00:08:46,695 --> 00:08:48,181
Oh my gosh, my eyes are watering

401
00:08:48,181 --> 00:08:49,014
that was just like...

402
00:08:49,014 --> 00:08:49,847
(whines)

403
00:08:49,847 --> 00:08:51,948
I do not like that prank for multiple reasons

404
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,573
and like one of them is I got baby powder all over my hands.

405
00:08:53,573 --> 00:08:54,656
I'm gonna go wash my hands really quick.

406
00:08:54,656 --> 00:08:55,489
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, no, no, no.

407
00:08:55,489 --> 00:08:56,322
Bro I got you.

408
00:08:56,322 --> 00:08:57,301
I got hand sanitizer right here.

409
00:08:57,301 --> 00:08:58,134
Here you go.

410
00:08:58,134 --> 00:08:58,967
- How much should I use?

411
00:08:58,967 --> 00:08:59,800
- I don't know.

412
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,633
- This hand sanitizer is like extra thick.

413
00:09:00,633 --> 00:09:02,324
Hold on wait like ...

414
00:09:02,324 --> 00:09:03,157
Yo!

415
00:09:03,157 --> 00:09:03,990
- What?

416
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:06,085
- What the heck is this?

417
00:09:06,085 --> 00:09:07,780
- Bro, it's clear glue.

418
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,349
- No, you glued my hands together.

419
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:10,182
Yeah, yeah I did.

420
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:11,090
- What?

421
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:13,344
Bro they're legit stuck, - Really?

422
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:14,177
- Try to pull them apart.

423
00:09:14,177 --> 00:09:15,842
I can't get them apart.

424
00:09:15,842 --> 00:09:16,685
My hands are stuck together,

425
00:09:16,685 --> 00:09:17,518
like I can't even get them apart.

426
00:09:17,518 --> 00:09:19,077
So show them I guess how you do it.

427
00:09:19,077 --> 00:09:19,910
- Yeah, so basically,

428
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,618
you take a regular hand sanitizer,

429
00:09:21,618 --> 00:09:22,982
you unscrew the top,

430
00:09:22,982 --> 00:09:23,815
empty the bottle,

431
00:09:23,815 --> 00:09:26,647
and then you take some clear glue and fill that back up,

432
00:09:26,647 --> 00:09:28,143
and then you use it on your friend.

433
00:09:28,143 --> 00:09:29,537
- Well, be careful guys because my hands are

434
00:09:29,537 --> 00:09:31,109
literally glued together right now.

435
00:09:31,109 --> 00:09:32,660
I have to go figure out how to like,

436
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,493
separate my hands

437
00:09:33,493 --> 00:09:35,159
and then we'll go on to the next round.

438
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:37,089
- I've heard hand sanitizer works for that

439
00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:40,062
so let's just use some hand sanitizer right there.

440
00:09:40,062 --> 00:09:40,895
- Is that more glue?

441
00:09:40,895 --> 00:09:41,989
(laughing) That's more...

442
00:09:41,989 --> 00:09:43,255
- I can't believe you fell for that.

443
00:09:43,255 --> 00:09:44,930
- I'm done, I'm done, I'm out. I'm out.

444
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:46,486
- Alright, bye Collins.

445
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:47,319
Bro, check out this glass ornament I made.

446
00:09:47,319 --> 00:09:48,840
- That thing is awesome.

447
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,681
- I know, it looks pretty cool.

448
00:09:49,681 --> 00:09:51,555
I wonder how it tastes, bro.

449
00:09:51,555 --> 00:09:52,959
- No Devin, Devin, no.

450
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,175
What is it?!

451
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,260
- It's just jello, bro.

452
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,093
- No way, let me see this.

453
00:09:56,093 --> 00:09:56,926
- Yeah bro. (chomps)

454
00:09:56,926 --> 00:09:57,847
(screams)

455
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,455
This one is super fun to make.

456
00:09:59,455 --> 00:10:00,288
All you need is some jello.

457
00:10:00,288 --> 00:10:02,685
You're gonna need some more jello.

458
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:05,435
(squeaky voices)

459
00:10:06,543 --> 00:10:08,552
Just kidding all we're going to need right now is the jello.

460
00:10:08,552 --> 00:10:09,385
Again.

461
00:10:09,385 --> 00:10:10,218
So what you're going to do

462
00:10:10,218 --> 00:10:11,051
is you're going to take water, and you're gonna fill it up.

463
00:10:11,051 --> 00:10:12,835
- I half expected you to throw that water.

464
00:10:12,835 --> 00:10:13,668
- Oh that's a good idea.

465
00:10:13,668 --> 00:10:14,501
- No, no.

466
00:10:14,501 --> 00:10:15,334
(scream)

467
00:10:15,334 --> 00:10:16,794
(slow motion scream)

468
00:10:16,794 --> 00:10:17,627
So I guess that's like a little bonus prank

469
00:10:17,627 --> 00:10:19,137
you can just dump water on someone.

470
00:10:19,137 --> 00:10:20,613
- That's not a prank bro.

471
00:10:20,613 --> 00:10:22,383
- Let's dump this into the hot plate.

472
00:10:22,383 --> 00:10:23,411
Alright so now it's starting to boil

473
00:10:23,411 --> 00:10:25,206
so we each add three full packets.

474
00:10:25,206 --> 00:10:26,489
We gotta pour all of them all at once.

475
00:10:26,489 --> 00:10:27,447
- Wait what?

476
00:10:27,447 --> 00:10:28,280
- Alright we gotta mix it together.

477
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,371
- It's congealing and it smells disgusting.

478
00:10:30,371 --> 00:10:31,571
Oh man!

479
00:10:31,571 --> 00:10:33,918
- Oh man - Holy cow that's disgusting.

480
00:10:33,918 --> 00:10:35,943
Jello smells good, but gelatin,

481
00:10:35,943 --> 00:10:36,960
not good. - Not so good

482
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,534
- Alright Devin so now we gotta fill up our containers.

483
00:10:38,534 --> 00:10:41,231
This smells so disgusting.

484
00:10:41,231 --> 00:10:42,623
Let's get this thing outta here cause woo,

485
00:10:42,623 --> 00:10:43,456
it smells.

486
00:10:43,456 --> 00:10:44,897
- Don't eat it please.

487
00:10:44,897 --> 00:10:45,730
- Eee, nope.

488
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:46,563
I'm just going to add a ton of food coloring

489
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:48,115
and hope it takes over.

490
00:10:48,115 --> 00:10:49,115
Alright now I've gotta mix it up

491
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:50,799
it's a deep, deep, deep blue.

492
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:51,891
I'm going to add mine in.

493
00:10:51,891 --> 00:10:53,386
There we go, done...

494
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:54,827
Oh bro it smells disgusting.

495
00:10:54,827 --> 00:10:55,660
- Ah, yeah.

496
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,659
- The top is on, done.

497
00:10:56,659 --> 00:10:57,763
We're going to put this in the fridge

498
00:10:57,763 --> 00:10:58,670
and let's see if we can get the smell

499
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:59,651
out of here, alright, let's go.

500
00:10:59,651 --> 00:11:02,303
Now they are done and let's see how they turned out.

501
00:11:02,303 --> 00:11:03,136
You ready?

502
00:11:03,136 --> 00:11:04,477
- [Both] Oh!

503
00:11:04,477 --> 00:11:05,310
- [Devin] Bro! - [Collins] Holy cow!

504
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:08,220
(yelling) That's crazy.

505
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,845
And now, Devin, the finishing touch.

506
00:11:09,845 --> 00:11:10,855
We've got the top of the ornament

507
00:11:10,855 --> 00:11:12,646
so you take one, kind of squish it in.

508
00:11:12,646 --> 00:11:13,904
Tada!

509
00:11:13,904 --> 00:11:15,853
Alright, so right, guys, now we're coming down

510
00:11:15,853 --> 00:11:17,315
to the finale and then you're going to find out

511
00:11:17,315 --> 00:11:19,782
what's inside the mystery box.

512
00:11:19,782 --> 00:11:20,615
Here it is,

513
00:11:20,615 --> 00:11:21,757
the moment of truth.

514
00:11:21,757 --> 00:11:24,694
It all comes down to the box of mystery, Devin.

515
00:11:24,694 --> 00:11:25,731
You get to open it up.

516
00:11:25,731 --> 00:11:26,899
I'm just gonna kinda to sit back.

517
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:29,568
- You got me scared now.

518
00:11:29,568 --> 00:11:30,401
(laughing)

519
00:11:30,401 --> 00:11:31,585
You scared me so bad

520
00:11:31,585 --> 00:11:32,418
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

521
00:11:32,418 --> 00:11:33,251
- I'm gonna get it over with.

522
00:11:33,251 --> 00:11:34,084
Alright,

523
00:11:34,084 --> 00:11:34,917
three, two, one...

524
00:11:34,917 --> 00:11:36,269
What, bro what?

525
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:37,455
A piece of cardboard?

526
00:11:37,455 --> 00:11:39,313
- No, no no no, see this cardboard

527
00:11:39,313 --> 00:11:40,146
is actually very important

528
00:11:40,146 --> 00:11:42,212
and you guys will see why right now.

529
00:11:42,212 --> 00:11:43,369
Alright, here we go.

530
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,229
I've got some eggs

531
00:11:44,229 --> 00:11:45,062
- Wait, no no no no.

532
00:11:45,062 --> 00:11:47,290
- Don't worry I'm just putting them on the plate here.

533
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,123
There we go,

534
00:11:48,123 --> 00:11:48,956
that's definitely not how you're supposed to crack an egg

535
00:11:48,956 --> 00:11:49,789
but...

536
00:11:49,789 --> 00:11:51,699
For this prank, you are going to need three eggs.

537
00:11:51,699 --> 00:11:52,905
- How much flour Collins?

538
00:11:52,905 --> 00:11:54,173
- I would say just enough to kind of like

539
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:55,006
fill up the surface of the plate.

540
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:56,939
So now I've gotta get my scrambling arm together

541
00:11:56,939 --> 00:11:58,532
scramble, scramble, scramble, scramble.

542
00:11:58,532 --> 00:12:00,152
Next I take the breadcrumbs,

543
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:00,985
place them on this plate over here.

544
00:12:00,985 --> 00:12:03,959
- Bro I have no idea what we're doing this for.

545
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:05,665
- Trust me, Devin, it'll all make sense.

546
00:12:05,665 --> 00:12:07,960
This is probably the craziest prank of them all.

547
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,829
Alright, let the prank begin.

548
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:11,849
So step one, put this here in the egg.

549
00:12:11,849 --> 00:12:12,793
- Oh, that's gross.

550
00:12:12,793 --> 00:12:13,794
- Use a fork to flip it.

551
00:12:13,794 --> 00:12:14,627
- Okay.

552
00:12:14,627 --> 00:12:17,152
- And then we'll get side number two

553
00:12:17,152 --> 00:12:17,985
There we go

554
00:12:17,985 --> 00:12:18,818
Bam!

555
00:12:18,818 --> 00:12:19,696
Then we're moving to the flour

556
00:12:19,696 --> 00:12:20,529
get it kinda in there,

557
00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:21,501
just really move it around

558
00:12:21,501 --> 00:12:22,667
cool and then we'll flip it over.

559
00:12:22,667 --> 00:12:24,375
Oh man, I'm sorry.

560
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:25,899
I got flour everywhere. - Oh, gross.

561
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:27,279
- And thenDevin, you get to pick this up

562
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,636
and then kind of dunk it in the breadcrumbs.

563
00:12:28,636 --> 00:12:29,469
- Wait, but I don't want to

564
00:12:29,469 --> 00:12:30,302
Ew.

565
00:12:30,302 --> 00:12:31,135
- Actually, wait.

566
00:12:31,135 --> 00:12:32,735
Before you do that just to ensure that it sticks,

567
00:12:32,735 --> 00:12:34,440
I'm going to drizzle more egg on top of it.

568
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,273
- No, why, that's a lot.

569
00:12:35,273 --> 00:12:37,164
- Yep so there you go.

570
00:12:37,164 --> 00:12:37,997
- Ew

571
00:12:39,012 --> 00:12:39,845
- Alright. So now you're going to flip it over Devin.

572
00:12:39,845 --> 00:12:42,081
- Alright (exclamations)

573
00:12:42,081 --> 00:12:42,914
- You've gotta get...

574
00:12:42,914 --> 00:12:44,222
Get some more egg juice on there.

575
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:45,480
There we go, perfect.

576
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,313
There we go.

577
00:12:46,313 --> 00:12:47,173
'Cause we need to make sure that

578
00:12:47,173 --> 00:12:48,148
the breadcrumbs stick to it, Devin.

579
00:12:48,148 --> 00:12:49,102
You're going to want to get your hands

580
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:49,935
in there at this point

581
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:50,768
and you're just gonna want to take it like this

582
00:12:50,768 --> 00:12:53,081
and then just really work it in like that.

583
00:12:53,081 --> 00:12:54,591
That's how you gotta do a good prank right here.

584
00:12:54,591 --> 00:12:55,424
Alright, there we go,

585
00:12:55,424 --> 00:12:56,482
we now have all the crumbs on it.

586
00:12:56,482 --> 00:12:58,324
- Bro, I don't even get what this is for.

587
00:12:58,324 --> 00:13:00,774
- Trust me, you'll understand in just a moment.

588
00:13:00,774 --> 00:13:01,607
Alright, here we go.

589
00:13:01,607 --> 00:13:05,612
- Wait bro, what, you're deep frying cardboard?

590
00:13:05,612 --> 00:13:06,465
- Exactly

591
00:13:06,465 --> 00:13:07,298
Yo, it is like sizzling bro.

592
00:13:07,298 --> 00:13:09,966
- I am so confused right now.

593
00:13:09,966 --> 00:13:11,132
- Call me Master Chef, Devin,

594
00:13:11,132 --> 00:13:13,340
because currently I am a Master Chef.

595
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,616
- I don't believe you.

596
00:13:14,616 --> 00:13:16,292
- Alright time to flip it over.

597
00:13:16,292 --> 00:13:18,634
Man, these tongs are not easy to deal with bro.

598
00:13:18,634 --> 00:13:19,467
(exclamations)

599
00:13:19,467 --> 00:13:21,111
Holy cow it's coming around

600
00:13:21,111 --> 00:13:22,482
and turn it over like that.

601
00:13:22,482 --> 00:13:23,399
Bam.

602
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:24,551
- What are we making?

603
00:13:24,551 --> 00:13:26,566
- So this right here is a cardboard

604
00:13:26,566 --> 00:13:27,880
chicken cutlet sandwich.

605
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,012
But because of the breadcrumbs

606
00:13:29,012 --> 00:13:30,916
it smells just like a chicken cutlet

607
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:32,109
like it's crazy.

608
00:13:32,109 --> 00:13:32,942
It smells like it,

609
00:13:32,942 --> 00:13:34,299
it looks like it,

610
00:13:34,299 --> 00:13:37,389
but the real question is is it going to taste like it?

611
00:13:37,389 --> 00:13:39,176
- I don't think so, it's cardboard bro.

612
00:13:39,176 --> 00:13:40,332
- We're going to do a rock paper scissors

613
00:13:40,332 --> 00:13:42,115
to find out who has to eat it,

614
00:13:42,115 --> 00:13:43,310
best two out of three.

615
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:45,610
- [Both] Rock paper scissors shoot,

616
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:47,688
rock paper scissors shoot.

617
00:13:47,688 --> 00:13:48,914
(exclamations)

618
00:13:48,914 --> 00:13:50,572
Devin's about to have to take a bite of that

619
00:13:50,572 --> 00:13:53,047
and comment down below what is your favorite food

620
00:13:53,047 --> 00:13:55,177
that we should incorporate into a prank?

621
00:13:55,177 --> 00:13:56,010
This time was a chicken cutlet

622
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:57,126
on not...

623
00:13:57,126 --> 00:13:57,959
- I'm ready dude.

624
00:13:57,959 --> 00:13:59,279
- Oh, my gosh.

625
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,870
- Oh, it's so stiff.

626
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,448
- It was literally cardboard.

627
00:14:02,448 --> 00:14:05,706
- Alright, here we go, 3, 2, 1.

628
00:14:05,706 --> 00:14:06,539
(crunch)

629
00:14:06,539 --> 00:14:09,039
- Ah, you're eating cardboard.

630
00:14:09,897 --> 00:14:11,316
Holy cow.

00:14:11,316 --> 00:14:12,591
