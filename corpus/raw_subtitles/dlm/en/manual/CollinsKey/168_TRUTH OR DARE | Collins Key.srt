1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,833
- What's up?

2
00:00:00,833 --> 00:00:02,985
It's Collins Key, and welcome to the Thursday vlog,

3
00:00:02,985 --> 00:00:04,328
and for today's video,

4
00:00:04,328 --> 00:00:05,584
I'm gonna do something that I haven't done

5
00:00:05,584 --> 00:00:07,497
on this channel in, it's been about a year.

6
00:00:07,497 --> 00:00:09,278
You guys really enjoyed the last one I did,

7
00:00:09,278 --> 00:00:10,557
so today, I'm going to be doing

8
00:00:10,557 --> 00:00:12,666
a brand new Truth or Dare video.

9
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:13,904
(imitates gun firing)

10
00:00:13,904 --> 00:00:15,152
I had you guys tweet in a whole bunch of truths,

11
00:00:15,152 --> 00:00:15,985
a whole bunch of dares,

12
00:00:15,985 --> 00:00:18,927
and also, you might be featured at the end of this video.

13
00:00:18,927 --> 00:00:20,181
Like, your picture on the screen.

14
00:00:20,181 --> 00:00:21,751
So make sure you guys stick around 'til the very end.

15
00:00:21,751 --> 00:00:24,852
Without further ado, let's jump into these truths and dares.

16
00:00:24,852 --> 00:00:25,977
"Do a standing back flip."

17
00:00:25,977 --> 00:00:30,568
Hopefully, I don't break my neck, but let's give it a shot.

18
00:00:30,568 --> 00:00:31,608
Oh, snap!

19
00:00:31,608 --> 00:00:32,710
That just happened!

20
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:34,192
"Have you dated a girl before?"

21
00:00:34,192 --> 00:00:35,698
I think it all depends on your definition of dating

22
00:00:35,698 --> 00:00:38,334
because when I was 12, I "dated" a girl,

23
00:00:38,334 --> 00:00:40,028
but most we ever did was, we talked on the phone,

24
00:00:40,028 --> 00:00:42,520
and I hugged her one time, which was pretty serious,

25
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,937
and so, I don't know if that's considered "dating" or not.

26
00:00:45,937 --> 00:00:47,391
"Do you ever wear tank tops?"

27
00:00:47,391 --> 00:00:48,635
Definitely, all the time.

28
00:00:48,635 --> 00:00:50,189
"I've watched you for two years,

29
00:00:50,189 --> 00:00:51,930
and I dare you to do a smack cam."

30
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,315
Under normal circumstances, I would not do a smack cam,

31
00:00:54,315 --> 00:00:56,309
but because you've been supporting me for two years,

32
00:00:56,309 --> 00:00:59,340
I love you, so, smack cam, here we go right now.

33
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,197
Alright guys, smack cam.

34
00:01:01,197 --> 00:01:02,038
Ah!

35
00:01:02,038 --> 00:01:02,920
"Do you have a crush?"

36
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,995
Low key. Right now, I do actually have a crush on someone,

37
00:01:04,995 --> 00:01:06,441
and I don't wanna say who it is,

38
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:08,064
because it'll make things kinda awkward.

39
00:01:08,064 --> 00:01:09,057
I'm a magician, okay?

40
00:01:09,057 --> 00:01:09,998
I'm good at keeping secrets.

41
00:01:09,998 --> 00:01:11,465
"Put Devan in this video."

42
00:01:11,465 --> 00:01:12,806
Let me see what I can do. (snaps)

43
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:14,643
- Hello, bye. (snaps) - And there're your dose

44
00:01:14,643 --> 00:01:15,624
of Devan for the video.

45
00:01:15,624 --> 00:01:16,943
"Would you ever date a fan?"

46
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:18,237
Yeah, absolutely, why not?

47
00:01:18,237 --> 00:01:19,722
So, if you're watching this right now,

48
00:01:19,722 --> 00:01:23,889
me and you, we can be relationship goals. (laughs)

49
00:01:24,893 --> 00:01:25,852
Yeah, next question.

50
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:27,053
(sneezes loudly)

51
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:28,316
Jesus Christ, Holy Mary.

52
00:01:28,316 --> 00:01:30,678
"Send an ugly selfie to the last person you texted."

53
00:01:30,678 --> 00:01:32,697
Alright, here we go. (camera shutter clicks)

54
00:01:32,697 --> 00:01:35,446
Alright, I'm sending that to Gabriel from Vine, and send.

55
00:01:35,446 --> 00:01:36,917
"Take three bites of an onion."

56
00:01:36,917 --> 00:01:37,834
Here we go.

57
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,917
(onion crunches) (spits)

58
00:01:45,408 --> 00:01:48,862
(onion crunches) (coughs)

59
00:01:48,862 --> 00:01:50,830
I am done. Done with that onion.

60
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:53,185
"For you, what is the most beautiful thing about a girl?"

61
00:01:53,185 --> 00:01:54,543
Well, right off the bat, there's a couple things

62
00:01:54,543 --> 00:01:55,495
that stand out to me.

63
00:01:55,495 --> 00:01:57,534
One is when a girl has a really pretty smile.

64
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,219
I'm instantly attracted to her.

65
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:00,584
When a girl has pretty eyes.

66
00:02:00,584 --> 00:02:02,130
I would say the most beautiful thing is

67
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,526
an amazing personality.

68
00:02:03,526 --> 00:02:05,499
That is the most attractive thing to me.

69
00:02:05,499 --> 00:02:07,010
"Have you ever kissed another YouTuber?"

70
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:07,843
Nope.

71
00:02:07,843 --> 00:02:09,975
"Shower with your clothes on, or no shirt."

72
00:02:09,975 --> 00:02:12,059
Alright guys, here's the fully clothed shower,

73
00:02:12,059 --> 00:02:13,557
and to make this even more fun,

74
00:02:13,557 --> 00:02:15,422
I'm gonna go on super cold water.

75
00:02:15,422 --> 00:02:16,922
So yeah, let's go.

76
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,007
Yup, there you go, hope you guys are enjoying this.

77
00:02:26,361 --> 00:02:29,207
Yup, this is a great time. So cold.

78
00:02:29,207 --> 00:02:31,765
Alright guys, I gotta take a shower, bye.

79
00:02:31,765 --> 00:02:33,732
"When are you planning on getting married?"

80
00:02:33,732 --> 00:02:35,092
I don't have a set age of like,

81
00:02:35,092 --> 00:02:36,504
at this age I wanna get married,

82
00:02:36,504 --> 00:02:39,032
but it more has to do with the girl.

83
00:02:39,032 --> 00:02:40,205
When I find the right girl,

84
00:02:40,205 --> 00:02:42,277
I think that'll be the right age.

85
00:02:42,277 --> 00:02:44,247
"If you could make up a law, what would it be?"

86
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,750
Law number one, every one must cover their mouth

87
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,475
when they cough or sneeze. (sneezes loudly)

88
00:02:49,475 --> 00:02:51,240
"How much money have you spent on eggs?"

89
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,920
Most I've spent on eggs, for a video, was the GloZell video,

90
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,231
because those ostrich eggs,

91
00:02:55,231 --> 00:02:57,327
they were $50 dollars a piece.

92
00:02:57,327 --> 00:02:59,052
And I had seven or eight of them.

93
00:02:59,052 --> 00:03:00,131
But, if you really look at it,

94
00:03:00,131 --> 00:03:02,438
an ostrich egg is $50 dollars,

95
00:03:02,438 --> 00:03:04,537
cracking it on GloZell's head?

96
00:03:04,537 --> 00:03:05,370
Priceless.

97
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:07,771
"I dare you to eat a pickle covered in marshmallow fluff

98
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:08,877
while doing the whip."

99
00:03:08,877 --> 00:03:09,710
Alright, so I've got the pickle

100
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,255
and I've got the marshmallow stuff, so yeah,

101
00:03:11,255 --> 00:03:15,422
I'm just gonna dip it in here like this. I guess here we go.

102
00:03:17,012 --> 00:03:19,345
Ehh! (spits)

103
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,479
So gross. (laughs)

104
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:24,016
"Tell us some embarrassing moments you've had

105
00:03:24,016 --> 00:03:25,154
trying to impress people."

106
00:03:25,154 --> 00:03:27,002
Honestly, the amount of embarrassing moments I've had

107
00:03:27,002 --> 00:03:29,320
trying to impress people could fill an entire book.

108
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,172
One that happened actually very recently is,

109
00:03:31,172 --> 00:03:33,387
I was on the flight back from Playlist Live DC,

110
00:03:33,387 --> 00:03:34,978
there was a very pretty YouTuber,

111
00:03:34,978 --> 00:03:36,217
she was sitting a row behind me,

112
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:38,028
and I was sittin' all the way on the window seat,

113
00:03:38,028 --> 00:03:39,563
and I had to get up and use the restroom.

114
00:03:39,563 --> 00:03:40,989
I was like, oh, I'll impress her.

115
00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:43,709
I'll hop up on the seats and walk on the seats

116
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:44,823
and get up into the aisle,

117
00:03:44,823 --> 00:03:47,401
as opposed to just walking out like a normal person.

118
00:03:47,401 --> 00:03:48,919
And so I jumped up on the seats

119
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:51,822
and then the cushions on the seats slid out,

120
00:03:51,822 --> 00:03:53,553
so I fell over the row in front of me,

121
00:03:53,553 --> 00:03:54,687
hit this guy in the head,

122
00:03:54,687 --> 00:03:57,205
and everyone laughed, and, oh my gosh.

123
00:03:57,205 --> 00:03:59,252
#TheStruggleIsReal.

124
00:03:59,252 --> 00:04:01,419
"If you could kiss any YouTube girl, who would it be?"

125
00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:02,983
Actually, I wanna get you guys' opinion on this.

126
00:04:02,983 --> 00:04:05,409
So, comment down below what YouTuber you'd ship me with.

127
00:04:05,409 --> 00:04:07,194
You never know, it could actually happen.

128
00:04:07,194 --> 00:04:08,027
"What's your middle name?"

129
00:04:08,027 --> 00:04:09,441
What's my middle name?

130
00:04:09,441 --> 00:04:11,359
It's still Joseph, still Joseph. Swag. (giggles)

131
00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:13,885
So, yeah, my middle name is Joseph. Swag!

132
00:04:13,885 --> 00:04:15,352
"Would you consider your Keypers friends,

133
00:04:15,352 --> 00:04:16,730
or even closer to family?"

134
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:19,162
You guys are definitely my family, without a doubt.

135
00:04:19,162 --> 00:04:20,878
The Keyper family, when I say the Keyper family,

136
00:04:20,878 --> 00:04:22,898
I really mean that you guys are my family.

137
00:04:22,898 --> 00:04:24,524
You guys are just the most amazing family

138
00:04:24,524 --> 00:04:25,455
I could ever ask for.

139
00:04:25,455 --> 00:04:27,178
"Truth, do you like pickles?"

140
00:04:27,178 --> 00:04:28,486
I guess, yeah, they're okay.

141
00:04:28,486 --> 00:04:30,267
"I dare you to drink a jar of pickle juice."

142
00:04:30,267 --> 00:04:32,298
Awesome. Alright, well let's do it.

143
00:04:32,298 --> 00:04:33,756
So, I could just drink it out of a glass,

144
00:04:33,756 --> 00:04:34,962
and be a normal, boring person,

145
00:04:34,962 --> 00:04:38,212
but brought along this jar, so, cheers.

146
00:04:41,946 --> 00:04:44,974
(spits) Let's try again.

147
00:04:44,974 --> 00:04:49,141
(spits and snorts) Oh, it went up my nose.

148
00:04:53,071 --> 00:04:56,687
Yeah, there's no way. Sorry guys. I tried.

149
00:04:56,687 --> 00:04:57,520
I really tried.

150
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,906
"Use this as your last dare."

151
00:04:58,906 --> 00:05:00,345
And you know what, dare accepted.

152
00:05:00,345 --> 00:05:01,894

in a future, upcoming video?

158
00:05:09,511 --> 00:05:11,411
I'm starting something brand new on the channel.
