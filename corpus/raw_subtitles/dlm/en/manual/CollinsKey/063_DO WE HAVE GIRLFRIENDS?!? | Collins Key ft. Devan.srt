1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,218
- The redundant Devin is doing his hair.

2
00:00:02,218 --> 00:00:04,069
Well then, how do you wanna be introduced?

3
00:00:04,069 --> 00:00:06,292
- [Devan] I don't know, any other way than redundant.

4
00:00:06,292 --> 00:00:08,357
What's up y'all? (laughs)

5
00:00:08,357 --> 00:00:09,190
- [Collins] Okay.

6
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:10,089
- I'm taking over this channel.

7
00:00:10,089 --> 00:00:10,922
- [Collins] Okay, dude. I'm fine.

8
00:00:10,922 --> 00:00:11,755
- No, get out of here.

9
00:00:11,755 --> 00:00:12,588
- All right.

10
00:00:12,588 --> 00:00:13,421
- So, what's up guys?

11
00:00:13,421 --> 00:00:14,254
It is Devin Key

12
00:00:14,254 --> 00:00:17,265
and today we are going to introduce Collins

13
00:00:17,265 --> 00:00:18,985
who has never been on this channel

14
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:20,040
So without further ado,

15
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:24,622
Collins Key (snaps fingers).

16
00:00:24,622 --> 00:00:26,555
(snaps fingers) Oh!

17
00:00:26,555 --> 00:00:27,389
What's up, bro?

18
00:00:27,389 --> 00:00:28,222
- I'm not gonna edit that

19
00:00:28,222 --> 00:00:30,114
you're gonna look as stupid as it looks in real life.

20
00:00:30,114 --> 00:00:30,947
- Hey.

21
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:32,447
- Today's video, we're going to be doing a challenge.

22
00:00:32,447 --> 00:00:34,258
This one is called the Questions Only Challenge.

23
00:00:34,258 --> 00:00:35,447
And I thought on the TV show

24
00:00:35,447 --> 00:00:36,847
called Who's Line Is It Anyway?

25
00:00:36,847 --> 00:00:37,808
And how the challenge works

26
00:00:37,808 --> 00:00:39,752
is we have to have an entire conversation

27
00:00:39,752 --> 00:00:41,847
asking only questions,

28
00:00:41,847 --> 00:00:42,831
and whoever messes-up

29
00:00:42,831 --> 00:00:44,423
or uses a statement or something,

30
00:00:44,423 --> 00:00:46,200
they automatically lose that round.

31
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,129
There are three rounds,

32
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:48,735
whoever wins the majority of those rounds

33
00:00:48,735 --> 00:00:50,191
gets to tweet something inappropriate off

34
00:00:50,191 --> 00:00:52,087
of the loser's Twitter account.

35
00:00:52,087 --> 00:00:52,920
- Okay.

36
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,984
- Okay, so at the end of the video,

37
00:00:53,984 --> 00:00:55,525
I'll put whatever the screenshot of that tweet is,

38
00:00:55,525 --> 00:00:56,723
so make sure you guys stick around to the end

39
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:59,062
to see what that inappropriate tweet is.

40
00:00:59,062 --> 00:00:59,895
And without further ado,

41
00:00:59,895 --> 00:01:01,432
let's just jump right into.

42
00:01:01,432 --> 00:01:02,265
- Dive right into.

43
00:01:02,265 --> 00:01:03,240
- Just dive into this.

44
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,864
We're diving into this challenge.

45
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:05,753
- Whoa, sharks.

46
00:01:05,753 --> 00:01:06,656
- Just diving each way,

47
00:01:06,656 --> 00:01:08,736
just diving. (laughs)

48
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:09,569
- Are you ready? (claps)

49
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,504
- Yeah. (claps) All right.

50
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:12,337
- Oh!

51
00:01:12,337 --> 00:01:13,369
- No, dude, it did not start yet.

52
00:01:13,369 --> 00:01:14,383
It did not start yet.

53
00:01:14,383 --> 00:01:15,815
For those of you guys who don't know what just happened,

54
00:01:15,815 --> 00:01:16,743
he used a question and I did not...

55
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:17,695
We did not start.

56
00:01:17,695 --> 00:01:19,031
Round one did not commence yet.

57
00:01:19,031 --> 00:01:20,511
Round one is gonna be really easy,

58
00:01:20,511 --> 00:01:22,296
we're just gonna have a regular conversation.

59
00:01:22,296 --> 00:01:24,084
So round one, begin! (gong sound)

60
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:24,917
- Are you ready?

61
00:01:24,917 --> 00:01:26,388
- Are you ready?

62
00:01:26,388 --> 00:01:27,499
- Does it look like I'm ready?

63
00:01:27,499 --> 00:01:28,332
- Your eyebrows look kind of...

64
00:01:28,332 --> 00:01:30,488
Oh my god! Did I lose the first?

65
00:01:30,488 --> 00:01:31,321
- (Laughs)

66
00:01:31,321 --> 00:01:32,363
(bell rings)

67
00:01:32,363 --> 00:01:33,712
- I went down in an eyebrow joke.

68
00:01:33,712 --> 00:01:34,808
- (Claps)

69
00:01:34,808 --> 00:01:35,641
- Oh no!

70
00:01:35,641 --> 00:01:36,565
- Turn it up, turn it up.

71
00:01:36,565 --> 00:01:37,544
- I can't believe I lost that fast. Okay.

72
00:01:37,544 --> 00:01:39,064
- I'm so bad at this game too.

73
00:01:39,064 --> 00:01:39,897
- I know.

74
00:01:39,897 --> 00:01:41,024
Round one, Devan is the winner.

75
00:01:41,024 --> 00:01:42,496
Okay. How the heck did that happen?

76
00:01:42,496 --> 00:01:44,001
Round two is actually a little bit harder.

77
00:01:44,001 --> 00:01:45,776
- We're just gonna do random questions as fast-

78
00:01:45,776 --> 00:01:47,542
- As fast as-

79
00:01:47,542 --> 00:01:49,369
- As fast as possible!

80
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:50,202
Begin. (gong sound)

81
00:01:50,202 --> 00:01:51,038
- What's up dog?

82
00:01:51,038 --> 00:01:51,926
You see that?

83
00:01:51,926 --> 00:01:53,017
- Oh man! What's up Greg?

84
00:01:53,017 --> 00:01:54,967
- What's up? Is this as challenging as family?

85
00:01:54,967 --> 00:01:56,430
- Is that a high jump?

86
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,560
- Why are we jumping even in the first place?

87
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,456
- Is my head completely out of the frame?

88
00:02:00,456 --> 00:02:01,778
- I don't think...

89
00:02:01,778 --> 00:02:02,701
Darn it I lost!

90
00:02:02,701 --> 00:02:04,251
- Yeah! Woo!

91
00:02:04,251 --> 00:02:05,400
(bell rings)

92
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,150
Pretty nice, party dance, pretty nice.

93
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,062
- Why are we yelling?

94
00:02:08,062 --> 00:02:10,006
- Round three. (whip sound)

95
00:02:10,006 --> 00:02:11,118
This is the determining round,

96
00:02:11,118 --> 00:02:11,951
whoever wins this one

97
00:02:11,951 --> 00:02:13,247
gets to tweet something inappropriate

98
00:02:13,247 --> 00:02:14,566
off of the loser's account.

99
00:02:14,566 --> 00:02:15,399
- Oh snap.

100
00:02:15,399 --> 00:02:16,302
- So this is a big one,

101
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:19,142
and this round is all about relationships,

102
00:02:19,142 --> 00:02:20,055
and go! (gong sound)

103
00:02:20,055 --> 00:02:21,663
- Have you been in a relationship?

104
00:02:21,663 --> 00:02:22,767
- Do you have a girlfriend?

105
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:24,198
- Why do you wanna know my personal life?

106
00:02:24,198 --> 00:02:25,486
- When was your first kiss?

107
00:02:25,486 --> 00:02:27,881
- Why don't we talk about you?

108
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:28,714
- Why not?

109
00:02:28,714 --> 00:02:33,031
- (Laughs) Hey! And I am the mother freaking...

110
00:02:33,031 --> 00:02:35,421
(bell sound)

111
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:38,088
- Yes! (laughs)

112
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:44,230
- Oh no!

113
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,063
- Yes!

114
00:02:45,063 --> 00:02:46,727
- Why would I go down like that?

115
00:02:46,727 --> 00:02:48,267
- Yes! (laughs)

116
00:02:48,267 --> 00:02:49,100
- No!

117
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,121
I'm so mad at this.

118
00:02:50,121 --> 00:02:51,863
- You thought you had me.

119
00:02:51,863 --> 00:02:53,696
- I thought I had you.

120
00:02:54,935 --> 00:02:55,768
Oh man.

121
00:02:55,768 --> 00:02:57,279
- We got an instant replay of how convinced you were

122
00:02:57,279 --> 00:02:58,455
that you thought you won.

123
00:02:58,455 --> 00:02:59,288
- Oh my god.

124
00:02:59,288 --> 00:03:00,121
Hey!

125
00:03:00,121 --> 00:03:00,954
Hey!

126
00:03:00,954 --> 00:03:03,954
Hey! And I am the mother freaking...

127
00:03:04,987 --> 00:03:05,820
- (Claps)

128
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,242
If this video made you laugh or smile

129
00:03:07,242 --> 00:03:08,403
make sure to give it a thumbs up

130
00:03:08,403 --> 00:03:09,819
and also share it with all of your friends

131
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:11,563
so maybe put a smile on all their face today.

132
00:03:11,563 --> 00:03:12,683
Also comment down below,

133
00:03:12,683 --> 00:03:14,237
what are some other questions

134
00:03:14,237 --> 00:03:15,867
you would love to ask both of us?

135
00:03:15,867 --> 00:03:16,700
- Hey.

136
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,533
- All of Devan's social media links

137
00:03:17,533 --> 00:03:18,366
are in the description down below

138
00:03:18,366 --> 00:03:19,544
so you should go follow him.

139
00:03:19,544 --> 00:03:20,904
You know, he's pretty awesome,

140
00:03:20,904 --> 00:03:23,035
and also make sure you guys subscribe to this channel,

141
00:03:23,035 --> 00:03:24,952
new videos coming out every single Thursday.

142
00:03:24,952 --> 00:03:27,608
And here is the screenshot of the inappropriate tweet.

143
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:29,256
- Wham.

144
00:03:29,256 --> 00:03:30,089
Wow!

145
00:03:30,089 --> 00:03:31,626
- It's pretty inappropriate. (laughs)

146
00:03:31,626 --> 00:03:32,459
And it's gone.

147
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:33,610
Instead of making it disappear,

148
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,994
I have a new idea, are you ready? (blowing sound)

149
00:03:35,994 --> 00:03:39,325
(laughs) We did not rehearse that.

150
00:03:39,325 --> 00:03:43,455
I just looked like an idiot in my video. (laughs)

151
00:03:43,455 --> 00:03:44,288
Idiot!

152
00:03:45,285 --> 00:03:46,301
- That's so funny.

153
00:03:46,301 --> 00:03:47,509
- You're like, "What just happened?"

154
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:48,943
- (Snaps fingers) And he's gone!

155
00:03:48,943 --> 00:03:50,813
Oh! See you guys next week.

156
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:51,900
Bam!

157
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,171
Hopefully that covered it. Okay.
