1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,086
- Donut!

2
00:00:01,086 --> 00:00:02,698
(Screams)

3
00:00:02,698 --> 00:00:03,700
- Oh my gosh!

4
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:04,533
- It's Play-Doh, bro!

5
00:00:04,533 --> 00:00:06,500
You're telling us to turn real food into Play-Doh food

6
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:07,673
so right now, let's go.

7
00:00:07,673 --> 00:00:09,540
I gotta wash my mouth out, my gosh!

8
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:12,110
This round we are going to be making a hamburger, no!

9
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:13,677
Let's start with the lettuce.

10
00:00:13,677 --> 00:00:14,510
- The what?

11
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:15,343
Oh the lettuce.

12
00:00:15,343 --> 00:00:16,176
- Called a wham bam.

13
00:00:16,176 --> 00:00:17,550
This is how you make some good

14
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,530
quality organic free range lettuce.

15
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:20,500
- Where'd you get this bowl?

16
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,398
- I got it from my restaurant.

17
00:00:21,398 --> 00:00:22,231
- What?

18
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:23,250
- I own a restaurant now.

19
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,083
Oh, oh oh!

20
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:24,916
Got this thingy here,

21
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:25,749
which you put in the middle and then you're like.

22
00:00:25,749 --> 00:00:26,582
(screams)

23
00:00:26,582 --> 00:00:27,415
- You okay?

24
00:00:27,415 --> 00:00:29,720
Oh, you didn't see this on your own tool?

25
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:30,553
- Yeah.

26
00:00:30,553 --> 00:00:31,430
- I thought you owned your own restaurant.

27
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:32,500
- Yeah, but I wasn't fully trained.

28
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,620
Then we got a, ooh straight cutter.

29
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:34,453
Whoop!

30
00:00:34,453 --> 00:00:36,440
- Are you qualified to be making Play-Doh food, Collins?

31
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,273
- Maybe not!

32
00:00:37,273 --> 00:00:38,360
- All right, my patty is done.

33
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,510
Next up I'm gonna go for some cheese.

34
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:41,343
- Some cheese?

35
00:00:41,343 --> 00:00:42,540
- Some cheese right on that burger.

36
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,720
- [Collins] Now I'm just gonna cut my lettuce

37
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,970
in a very squiggly manner.

38
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:46,105
- They look like green bacon strips.

39
00:00:46,105 --> 00:00:46,938
- Slice

40
00:00:46,938 --> 00:00:47,771
(thuds)

41
00:00:47,771 --> 00:00:48,604
- No, whoa, whoa!

42
00:00:48,604 --> 00:00:49,477
Then I want your bacon.

43
00:00:49,477 --> 00:00:50,310
- No!

44
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:51,240
(babbles)

45
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,097
- I'll give your bacon back if you give me my burger back.

46
00:00:53,097 --> 00:00:53,930
- No.

47
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:54,763
(buzzer sounds)

48
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:56,120
Next up we're going to get the tomato going.

49
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,770
Going to use my little stamping machine.

50
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:00,590
Check this out from the front, and then from the back.

51
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:02,490
On a legitimate level, what is the point of this?

52
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:04,430
- Well if a two year old can figure it out, Collins,

53
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:05,577
I think you should be able to.

54
00:01:05,577 --> 00:01:06,410
(buzzer sounds)

55
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:08,050
- And for my tomato, I've got to cut out some,

56
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:10,460
like you know how tomatoes have holes in them?

57
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:11,880
Yep, definitely not the right tool.

58
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,450
Yo, yours is actually looking pretty good.

59
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:14,283
- Aw thanks man.

60
00:01:14,283 --> 00:01:15,116
- Squeeze, squeeze.

61
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:16,820
- Look at that cheese, look at the cheese.

62
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,397
- I want this whole piece, I need this piece.

63
00:01:18,397 --> 00:01:19,230
- No, my burger!

64
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:20,220
(slow motion yelling)

65
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,053
C'mon.

66
00:01:21,053 --> 00:01:22,260
- Here we go, so now we got my tomato.

67
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,272
Well, it's a lot smaller than I thought it would be.

68
00:01:24,272 --> 00:01:25,832
(whooping noises)

69
00:01:25,832 --> 00:01:27,440
- To me it kinda looks like a fidget spinner a little bit.

70
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,450
I don't think it'll spin.

71
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,100
Now it's time for the lettuce.

72
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:30,933
Come back.

73
00:01:30,933 --> 00:01:32,270
- Wait, are you making lettuce again?

74
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:36,060
- I need to have a super duper long piece of lettuce.

75
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,410
- That's completely unbroken, not a single hole.

76
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:39,490
- Now the burger part of it

77
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:40,323
is the most expensive part of my--

78
00:01:40,323 --> 00:01:41,860
So for this we really gotta make sure

79
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,210
that we don't give them too much

80
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:44,550
so you're not losing money as a business.

81
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:46,110
So it's gonna, there we go, there's the burger.

82
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,430
But we'll disguise it

83
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,540
with a massive tomato outline around it

84
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,780
so they won't even know it.

85
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:51,670
Brilliant.

86
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,080
What can this orange be used for?

87
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,530
My burger comes with a fully unpeeled orange.

88
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:56,363
- Wow.

89
00:01:56,363 --> 00:01:57,980
- All right so now we've gotta place a massive orange in it.

90
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:58,813
There we go.

91
00:01:58,813 --> 00:01:59,646
Yeah, I've run out of bread

92
00:01:59,646 --> 00:02:00,650
so I'm left with no other choice

93
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,080
but to make the top of my burger

94
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,400
the actual hamburger patty part of it.

95
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,640
So here we go, we got the perfectly round

96
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,870
and symmetrical burger.

97
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,360
Place it on top of the orange.

98
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,900
Actually, game changer.

99
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,473
Coat the orange in the burger.

100
00:02:11,473 --> 00:02:13,069
- That way nobody sees it.

101
00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:14,037
It's a burst of flavor.

102
00:02:14,037 --> 00:02:15,888
- Bite into like an orange rind, like

103
00:02:15,888 --> 00:02:16,740
(chomps)

104
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,510
- [Devan] How is your restaurant still open?

105
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:19,462
- And then of course to end it off.

106
00:02:19,462 --> 00:02:20,470
(dings)

107
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,970
So now I guess it's just gonna be boring

108
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,796
and I gotta sit back and wait for Devan to finish his.

109
00:02:23,796 --> 00:02:25,771
That looks so good, that is not fair.

110
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:27,450
All right, here's the big reveal, are you ready?

111
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,120
- Three, two, one.

112
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,953
- First--

113
00:02:29,953 --> 00:02:30,786
Five Second Subscribe Challenge.

114
00:02:30,786 --> 00:02:32,610
We want to see if you can subscribe to this channel

115
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,520
and turn on the channel post notifications

116
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,295
in five seconds, are you ready?

117
00:02:36,295 --> 00:02:40,926
- Five, four, three, two, one, done!

118
00:02:40,926 --> 00:02:42,625
Now if you can do that, comment down below.

119
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:43,458
- Comment down below.

120
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:44,291
- Keyper squad right now.

121
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:46,840
- Three, two, one, tada!

122
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,366
- I am not happy with how this turned out.

123
00:02:48,366 --> 00:02:49,794
So I'm gonna change it a little bit.

124
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:50,627
- What?

125
00:02:50,627 --> 00:02:51,813
- I need to grab this roller over here.

126
00:02:51,813 --> 00:02:53,210
And uh, see if it works.

127
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,062
Yo, it's perfect burger!

128
00:02:54,062 --> 00:02:54,895
- What?

129
00:02:54,895 --> 00:02:55,868
No, how did you do that?

130
00:02:55,868 --> 00:02:56,740
- Magic.

131
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,573
- What?

132
00:02:57,573 --> 00:02:58,406
- The best thing is, it even talks.

133
00:02:58,406 --> 00:02:59,239
Check this out.

134
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:00,610
Hey, I'm Bruce the burger.

135
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:03,040
- The burger's pretty awesome but it's pretty obvious

136
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,820
Bruce is not actually talking, bro.

137
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,045
- [Burger] Oh my god, it's Collins and Devan!

138
00:03:07,045 --> 00:03:07,960
- What? No!

139
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,790
- I am not just a burger.

140
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,670
(both shouting)

141
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,240
- All right, well that's round, let's go.

142
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,655
(trills)

143
00:03:14,655 --> 00:03:15,488
- For this--

144
00:03:15,488 --> 00:03:16,707
- No, not again, really?

145
00:03:16,707 --> 00:03:18,090
- Oh man, we are making a pizza.

146
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,510
I was trying to balance it, but it didn't work.

147
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,180
I'm gonna make this into some dough.

148
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,490
First we gotta actually spin it around

149
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:24,237
because we gotta get the pizza dough looking good.

150
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:25,669
So just gonna...

151
00:03:25,669 --> 00:03:26,502
No wow, all right.

152
00:03:26,502 --> 00:03:27,660
- For this I actually have a pizza roller

153
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,920
and I'm going to be making some long bread thin crust pizza.

154
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,010
- Some long bread?

155
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:33,778
Do we have another roller by any chance?

156
00:03:33,778 --> 00:03:34,720
- You can have it on loan.

157
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,530
- Wow, that's a really thin crust.

158
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:38,130
It's more like paper crust.

159
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:39,530
- That's how you know it's thin, Devan.

160
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:42,102
When it's thin enough to write the independence of decla..

161
00:03:42,102 --> 00:03:42,935
- What?

162
00:03:42,935 --> 00:03:44,010
- [Collins] Declaration of Independence on it.

163
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,470
Got the tomato sauce.

164
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,303
- Ooh.

165
00:03:46,303 --> 00:03:47,136
- Guys ready for this?

166
00:03:47,136 --> 00:03:47,969
It's called the slap pat.

167
00:03:47,969 --> 00:03:49,360
You go slap and then pat!

168
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,648
- What? - Pat!

169
00:03:50,648 --> 00:03:52,090
Luckily I got another one!

170
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,850
- Mine is gonna be a deep dish.

171
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,990
I just have no clue on how to do it yet.

172
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:57,390
- All my ingredients are super fresh.

173
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,840
I got a special tool right here.

174
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,990
And this turns into the freshest ingredients around.

175
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:01,950
Check it out!

176
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:02,810
Bam, there we go!

177
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:03,840
Fresh tomato!

178
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,280
- You can't use that, that's a real tomato.

179
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,490
- But it's my magical tool, of course I can use this.

180
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:09,023
Now, I'm gonna crush this into tomato sauce.

181
00:04:09,023 --> 00:04:10,060
(record scratching)

182
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,770
- Whoa whoa whoa bro, you can't do that!

183
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:13,150
It's a real tomato!

184
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,980
- Okay fine, so I guess we'll have to use the magical tool

185
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,020
one more time, here we go, three, two, one, boom!

186
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,395
There we go, now we got a little tomato.

187
00:04:18,395 --> 00:04:19,960
- How do you do that?

188
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,710
I'm pretty sure this is against the rules, bro.

189
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:22,543
- Now we go!

190
00:04:22,543 --> 00:04:23,376
- No!

191
00:04:23,376 --> 00:04:24,209
- [Collins] Whoohoo!

192
00:04:24,209 --> 00:04:25,260
- [Devan] That was such an awesome tomato, dude.

193
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,320
- Well now I gotta that for my tomato sauce, Devan.

194
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,160
You don't understand the way my restaurant works.

195
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,560
It's all about the element--

196
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,127
- [Both] Of surprise!

197
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,420
- [Collins] You totally didn't expect real and fake ones.

198
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,253
- Should've guessed.

199
00:04:35,253 --> 00:04:36,086
- Two more tomatoes for

200
00:04:36,086 --> 00:04:36,970
the rest of the tomato sauce.

201
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,100
Boom boom boom boom!

202
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,280
You're gonna do a little bit of bowling here,

203
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,264
and...

204
00:04:40,264 --> 00:04:41,097
(rolling)

205
00:04:41,097 --> 00:04:41,930
Oh, strike one.

206
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:43,046
(rolling)

207
00:04:43,046 --> 00:04:44,460
Oh, strike two.

208
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,363
Last one, here we go.

209
00:04:45,363 --> 00:04:46,196
(smacking)

210
00:04:46,196 --> 00:04:47,029
Oh!

211
00:04:47,029 --> 00:04:47,862
- Now you messin' with my play-doh.

212
00:04:47,862 --> 00:04:49,130
- That was a gutter ball.

213
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:49,963
- That's a no-no.

214
00:04:49,963 --> 00:04:51,520
Can I use one of your tools, Collins?

215
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,944
- Sharing is caring, Devan, all yours

216
00:04:52,944 --> 00:04:53,777
- Thank you.

217
00:04:53,777 --> 00:04:55,890
All right, gonna cut a big circle.

218
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,450
- Nice, great job, Devan.

219
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:58,925
Crushin' the game.

220
00:04:58,925 --> 00:04:59,845
He's not.

221
00:04:59,845 --> 00:05:00,678
- What?

222
00:05:00,678 --> 00:05:01,511
- I mean, look at my tomato sauce!

223
00:05:01,511 --> 00:05:02,344
I have this--

224
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:03,177
Ow!

225
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:04,050
- Sorry man, I'm making a masterpiece over here.

226
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:07,260
- Okay, now it's time to add one of my final elements to it,

227
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,000
which is of course, the cheese.

228
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,860
And you guys, this is a fancy restaurant,

229
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,640
and so we do what's called little cheese.

230
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,180
- Yours looks like a continent, bro.

231
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,050
- [Collins] Kinda like Africa, actually.

232
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,840
- I'm just gonna sprinkle a little bit of cheese on there.

233
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,740
- All right, next up I have to roll this out,

234
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,640
and speaking of rollers, where did my roller go, Collin?

235
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,473
- I don't know.

236
00:05:23,473 --> 00:05:24,370
- Okay.

237
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:26,520
- Last bit of cheese and now for the finishing touch,

238
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,076
you ready, a pineapple!

239
00:05:28,076 --> 00:05:28,909
(buzzer rings)

240
00:05:28,909 --> 00:05:29,742
What?

241
00:05:29,742 --> 00:05:31,194
- Well, looks like you got automatically disqualified

242
00:05:31,194 --> 00:05:33,029
for putting pineapple on your pizza.

243
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:34,840
That's a massive no-no.

244
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,673
- Oh my gosh, really?

245
00:05:35,673 --> 00:05:36,673
- So we're movin' on to the next round.

246
00:05:36,673 --> 00:05:39,266
- This round we are making some delicious ice cream.

247
00:05:39,266 --> 00:05:40,099
- Ooh!

248
00:05:40,099 --> 00:05:41,520
- So I'm gonna make a massive ice cream cone

249
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,420
with a ton of scoops, so yay!

250
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,674
- Okay, whoa, all right.

251
00:05:43,674 --> 00:05:44,886
- Whoo-hoo, and yeet!

252
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:45,719
- Ow!

253
00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:48,040
- I call this the two hand palm to palm technique.

254
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,330
Palm to palm to palm to palm.

255
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:51,076
- Bro, I'm gonna make a swirl with mine.

256
00:05:51,076 --> 00:05:51,909
Ooh!

257
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:52,742
- Yeah, well done.

258
00:05:52,742 --> 00:05:53,575
- [Devan] That looks awesome!

259
00:05:53,575 --> 00:05:54,693
- Next ball let's go!

260
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,930
Boom, there we go color number two,

261
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:00,120
we gotta of course get some vanilla, yeet!

262
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,409
- You've been hitting me this whole time.

263
00:06:01,409 --> 00:06:02,367
Yeet!

264
00:06:02,367 --> 00:06:03,200
Hey!

265
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,033
- You got me!

266
00:06:04,033 --> 00:06:05,419
- Yeet!

267
00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:06,560
- In the back in the head.

268
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,640
I'll get you soon.

269
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,010
All right, my first one is done, look at that thing.

270
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,080
That actually looks pretty cool.

271
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,367
I don't know what kind of flavor this is, but--

272
00:06:12,367 --> 00:06:14,160
- [Collin] What kind of flavor do you think that is?

273
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,993
- Lemon?

274
00:06:14,993 --> 00:06:15,826
- Yeah, maybe.

275
00:06:15,826 --> 00:06:16,659
Tumeric?

276
00:06:16,659 --> 00:06:17,540
- Tumeric?

277
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,373
Ginger!

278
00:06:18,373 --> 00:06:19,206
- Ginger ice cream, you know,

279
00:06:19,206 --> 00:06:20,609
- To give you a little bit of spice.

280
00:06:20,609 --> 00:06:21,500
When you're eating your ice cream.

281
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,333
New game, it's called

282
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,380
"Get the Play-Doh balls in a cup of Play-doh."

283
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,479
Here we go!

284
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:26,790
(both cheer)

285
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,064
- First try!

286
00:06:28,064 --> 00:06:29,574
(both cheer)

287
00:06:29,574 --> 00:06:30,824
(excited babbling)

288
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:31,984
- What?

289
00:06:31,984 --> 00:06:33,384
Don't mess it up!

290
00:06:33,384 --> 00:06:34,440
- So close.

291
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,900
- So not even close!

292
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,730
- Ice cream scoop-a-doop number one,

293
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:38,563
- Scoop-a-doop!

294
00:06:38,563 --> 00:06:39,960
- Scoop-a-doop number two,

295
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,020
oh that's coming along nicely.

296
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,710
Scoop-a-doop number three, four!

297
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:44,543
Boom, and--

298
00:06:44,543 --> 00:06:45,960
(both groan)

299
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,100
Locking mine in right now,

300
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,790
I added some extra flavor to it.

301
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:49,623
- And I am just about

302
00:06:49,623 --> 00:06:51,425
to add the chocolate dribbles to mine.

303
00:06:51,425 --> 00:06:52,290
(exclaims)

304
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:53,123
There it is, there it is.

305
00:06:53,123 --> 00:06:53,956
- Looks like a squid!

306
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:54,970
- Or chocolate dribbles.

307
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,220
- Yeah, or chocolate dribbles.

308
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,406
- That's not even looking too bad, yeah!

309
00:06:58,406 --> 00:06:59,800
Maybe take that one off.

310
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,880
- You even have a whipped cream dispenser?

311
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,713
- Oh yeah, I do.

312
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:04,890
Alright here we go, ooh this looks so good.

313
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,290
- [Collins] That actually looks like whipped cream,

314
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:07,123
that's crazy!

315
00:07:07,123 --> 00:07:09,000
- Dude this looks so good!

316
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,333
Oh no, oh no, oh no.

317
00:07:11,327 --> 00:07:12,490
(both exclaim)

318
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:13,323
- Done!

319
00:07:13,323 --> 00:07:14,156
(stammering)

320
00:07:14,156 --> 00:07:15,050
And locked it in!

321
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,690
- Here we go with the big reveal, you ready?

322
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:18,240
- Three, two, one--

323
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,250
Tada!

324
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,493
- So you get to comment down below.

325
00:07:20,493 --> 00:07:21,974
- Dude you're cheating!

326
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:22,994
That's not play-doh!

327
00:07:22,994 --> 00:07:24,330
- That's totally play-doh!

328
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:25,261
- It's really cold.

329
00:07:25,261 --> 00:07:26,930
- It's just cold play-doh.

330
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:28,285
- And it tastes exactly like ice cream.

331
00:07:28,285 --> 00:07:30,190
- So guys leave a comment down below,

332
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,220
who won this round,

333
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:34,030
and we are on to the next one.

334
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,583
- I could have sworn that looked different.

335
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:38,487
(both screaming)

336
00:07:38,487 --> 00:07:39,903
I guess this round we've got pop-tarts!

337
00:07:39,903 --> 00:07:40,806
(screaming)

338
00:07:40,806 --> 00:07:41,723
- That makes sense!

339
00:07:41,723 --> 00:07:43,300
- Let's make some pop-tarts!

340
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,133
Oh my gosh!

341
00:07:44,133 --> 00:07:45,960
- Alright I'm starting with my pop-tart base.

342
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,090
Hey it didn't hit me this time.

343
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,685
- Check this out, yeet!

344
00:07:48,685 --> 00:07:50,480
(both exclaim)

345
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,454
Time to roll it out my dude!

346
00:07:52,454 --> 00:07:55,640
Alright I gotta make sure my pop-tart's really thin,

347
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,710
because I have a super duper special idea

348
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:58,700
that I'm gonna be doing with it.

349
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,620
- Wow, dude, you even have a fingerprint in there.

350
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,070
- Here we go, we got the pink first,

351
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,032
oh, this is kind of cool,

352
00:08:03,032 --> 00:08:05,980
this is like a little fleet yeet shot, just--

353
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:06,813
Sorry.

354
00:08:06,813 --> 00:08:07,998
- You almost messed it up.

355
00:08:07,998 --> 00:08:08,831
- My bad!

356
00:08:08,831 --> 00:08:10,140
So I've got my first layer,

357
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:10,973
it's called the

358
00:08:10,973 --> 00:08:13,030
"roll in a circle with the palm of your hand".

359
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:15,090
- Alright, I'm kind of close to being done.

360
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,007
- Well, I--

361
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,410
It always happens!

362
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:21,420
Next ingredient, I call this one the plum!

363
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,704
- What kind of plum is flat?

364
00:08:22,704 --> 00:08:24,140
- Oh this is gonna be great.

365
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,530
Now for my master strategy to work

366
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:26,822
I just gotta fold it over.

367
00:08:26,822 --> 00:08:27,913
(gasps)

368
00:08:27,913 --> 00:08:29,153
I think it's gonna work.

369
00:08:29,153 --> 00:08:31,387
Alright here we go, I got a precise slice and dicer!

370
00:08:31,387 --> 00:08:33,430
- Hey, that's my dicer!

371
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,263
- Slice!

372
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:35,357
And then I'm gonna give it a nice little...

373
00:08:35,357 --> 00:08:36,190
Dice!

374
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,380
In my mind I thought this would look

375
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,900
a lot cooler than it's currently looking.

376
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,580
Well now we gotta seal up the edges,

377
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,980
pinch it together like this.

378
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,670
Looks more like a hot pocket than a pop-tart!

379
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,667
- That's like the chunky veggie hot pocket right there.

380
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:47,500
(laughs)

381
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,970
- Oh, no you didn't.

382
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:51,480
This is my final save right here, got my frosting.

383
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,313
Frosted!

384
00:08:52,313 --> 00:08:54,230
Finishing touches, gonna add sprinkles to it.

385
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,300
Ooh, that's a nice sprinkle.

386
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,310
Ooh, that's a very nice sprinkle.

387
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,840
Boom, my best sprinkle yet!

388
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,730
This is what they call, in show business,

389
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:01,280
or I think in just about any business.

390
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,113
- In play-doh business.

391
00:09:02,113 --> 00:09:02,946
- Make it or br--

392
00:09:02,946 --> 00:09:03,779
- Sorry.

393
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:04,830
- Make it or break it moment!

394
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,712
Here it is, slice down the middle!

395
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,260
Oh, that does not look promising!

396
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,960
This looks real bad!

397
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,820
Before I fully reveal it,

398
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,910
I'm locking it in right now.

399
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,510
You guys are gonna have to see how it turned out.

400
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:15,610
Wow!

401
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:17,150
Here we go with the big reveal, you ready for this?

402
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,760
But first, 3 second like challenge.

403
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,570
We want to see if you can like this video

404
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:22,090
in three seconds, are you ready?

405
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:25,112
- Three, two, one, done!

406
00:09:25,112 --> 00:09:26,310
Ta-da!

407
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:27,678
- Why didn't you work?

408
00:09:27,678 --> 00:09:28,511
(screams)

409
00:09:28,511 --> 00:09:29,695
- What are you doing with my best friend?

410
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:32,340
(all scream)

411
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,810
- This round we are making some pasta.

412
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,341
So right now, let's make some noodles!

413
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:36,174
Yeet!

414
00:09:36,174 --> 00:09:37,720
And then we go woo, and then we go yeet!

415
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,044
- How do those all hit me?

416
00:09:39,044 --> 00:09:40,030
Why do you get to go first?

417
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,010
- Because I'm the older brother.

418
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:42,552
Devan, I am the older brother, you can't do this,

419
00:09:42,552 --> 00:09:43,390
it's against my--

420
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,223
- I made it!

421
00:09:44,223 --> 00:09:45,056
(grunts)

422
00:09:45,056 --> 00:09:46,180
Look at that!

423
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,325
Okay, well-- Oop.

424
00:09:47,325 --> 00:09:49,410
Oh yeah, look at those nice noodles man.

425
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:50,840
- Well, I just have one long noodle.

426
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:55,210
Just gonna make one super duper long noodle.

427
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:56,640
And just a little bit of spaghetti sauce,

428
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,300
just to like coat the top of the noodle.

429
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,110
It almost looks like a snake of some sort.

430
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:01,500
Boom, spaghetti, yeti.

431
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,333
Three, two, one!

432
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,310
Boom! Oop, where'd it go?

433
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,143
Got it!

434
00:10:05,143 --> 00:10:07,130
Here we go, I'm making meat stars.

435
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:07,963
- Oh, snap!

436
00:10:07,963 --> 00:10:08,796
Cool.

437
00:10:08,796 --> 00:10:10,000
- Time to shred my meatballs!

438
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,500
Why is it yellow, that's not good.

439
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,690
It's still yellow!

440
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:15,310
This is the finishing touch on my dish, you ready?

441
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:16,810
If this meatball lands in the dish,

442
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:17,643
you get it in your order.

443
00:10:17,643 --> 00:10:18,980
- What happens if it doesn't?

444
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:19,813
- You don't get a meatball.

445
00:10:19,813 --> 00:10:21,210
I'm gonna close my eyes and see if I can do it.

446
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:22,282
Three, two, one.

447
00:10:22,282 --> 00:10:23,282
(swoosh)

448
00:10:23,282 --> 00:10:24,560
Has it landed yet?

449
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,393
- Yep!

450
00:10:25,393 --> 00:10:26,226
It totally landed.

451
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:27,059
- Where did it go?

452
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:27,892
- I think you made it disappear man.

453
00:10:27,892 --> 00:10:28,733
Your magical powers are failing.

454
00:10:28,733 --> 00:10:29,566
- What?

455
00:10:29,566 --> 00:10:30,950
No way, because if I want my meatball back,

456
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:31,822
I can get it back.

457
00:10:31,822 --> 00:10:32,655
(claps)

458
00:10:32,655 --> 00:10:34,460
Oh my gosh, where did that come from?

459
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,293
Goodness!

460
00:10:35,293 --> 00:10:36,126
Done!

461
00:10:36,126 --> 00:10:37,200
A masterpiece.

462
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,799
- But it didn't technically land in there, so uh--

463
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:40,780
- What it did, it was like a meteorite,

464
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,570
and it was like magic, and now it's there.

465
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:43,770
- Uh, okay.

466
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:44,603
- Locking it in.

467
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:46,150
Devan's taking forever, but remember guys,

468
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:48,490
at the end of this we'll be looking inside the mystery box,

469
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:49,714
and I've heard there's something super cool

470
00:10:49,714 --> 00:10:51,117
and delicious inside of it so,

471
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:52,930
we can't eat any of the play-doh food,

472
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:54,280
but hopefully we'll be able to eat

473
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,340
whatever is inside of the mystery box

474
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,860
and hopefully it won't actually be terrible.

475
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,657
- Alright, it is finally time to lock it in.

476
00:10:58,657 --> 00:11:00,831
- Three, two, one, ta-da!

477
00:11:00,831 --> 00:11:03,410
- So, yeah, you get to comment down below,

478
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:04,710
who do you think won this round

479
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:05,570
and made the better whatever.

480
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:06,650
Remember, mine's creative,

481
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:08,380
you've never seen a one-noodle pasta before.

482
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,510
So, right now we're on to the next round.

483
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:11,501
- Check this out!

484
00:11:11,501 --> 00:11:12,480
- Dude!

485
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,892
- They smell so good!

486
00:11:13,892 --> 00:11:16,370
- They're like tiny little versions of candy!

487
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:17,203
- What is this?

488
00:11:17,203 --> 00:11:18,318
Oh, I thought it was a mustache at first.

489
00:11:18,318 --> 00:11:19,390
(old-fashioned music)

490
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,663
- Hey, it's a pineapple!

491
00:11:20,663 --> 00:11:22,079
- It's a pineapple!

492
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,296
- Do not put this on a pizza, I learned my lesson.

493
00:11:23,296 --> 00:11:24,129
- I won't.

494
00:11:24,129 --> 00:11:25,700
Bro, this one even has a bruised bit!

495
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,630
- Man, the attention to detail on these.

496
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,700
- So I guess you just wanna try them?

497
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,533
- Uh, yeah!

498
00:11:29,533 --> 00:11:30,800
- Comment down below what other foods

499
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,820
should we make out of play-doh.

500
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,460
I guess we should try the ice cream cone first?

501
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,894
- I'm gonna go for the watermelon Popsicle, bro.

502
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:36,080
- Alright, here we go, ready?

503
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,941
- Three, two, one.

504
00:11:37,941 --> 00:11:39,941
(moans)

505
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,073
- The texture!

506
00:11:43,073 --> 00:11:44,060
It's like cookie dough!

507
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,790
But like way sweeter and not chunky at all.

508
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:47,800
- Oh my god.

509
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,633
- Wow.

510
00:11:48,633 --> 00:11:49,520
- Yo, this one looks like a tomato!

511
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,353
- I'm going for the strawberry, dude.

512
00:11:50,353 --> 00:11:51,740
- And the craziest thing is

513
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,420
the texture kinda reminds me of play-doh.

514
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,490
We weren't able to eat any play-doh this whole time.

515
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:56,615
- Oh, you're right.

516
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:57,840
- That's why it's in the mystery box.

517
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,820
Alright, let's take a bite, you ready?

518
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,463
- Three, two, one.

519
00:12:01,665 --> 00:12:02,920
(moaning)

520
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,888
- What?

521
00:12:03,888 --> 00:12:04,721
(mumbles)

522
00:12:04,721 --> 00:12:05,554
- It's plastic?

523
00:12:05,554 --> 00:12:06,718
- Why would you eat the plastic?

524
00:12:06,718 --> 00:12:08,950
- I'm gonna take a bite of this one.

525
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:10,265
- Flamingo is the best one!

526
00:12:10,265 --> 00:12:12,121
- Alright subscribe right here for another video,

527
00:12:12,121 --> 00:12:12,954
(mumbles)

528
00:12:12,954 --> 00:12:15,567
- Five, four, three, two, one!

529
00:12:16,864 --> 00:12:17,697
Done!

530
00:12:17,697 --> 00:12:18,672
- Thank you for watching,

531
00:12:18,672 --> 00:12:19,505
- Bye!
