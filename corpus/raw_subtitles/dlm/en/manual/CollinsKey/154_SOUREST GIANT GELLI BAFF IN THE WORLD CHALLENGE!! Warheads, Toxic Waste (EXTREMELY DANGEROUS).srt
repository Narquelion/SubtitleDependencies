1
00:00:00,128 --> 00:00:00,961
(gagging)

2
00:00:00,961 --> 00:00:02,726
- Yeah, my tongue looks like I feel right now,

3
00:00:02,726 --> 00:00:03,559
just messed up.

4
00:00:03,559 --> 00:00:05,138
This smells like a fart!

5
00:00:05,138 --> 00:00:06,319
(sniffing)

6
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:09,117
(grunting)

7
00:00:09,117 --> 00:00:10,803
- I love chocolate.

8
00:00:10,803 --> 00:00:12,789
(laughing)

9
00:00:12,789 --> 00:00:14,472
There are dead ants in it.

10
00:00:14,472 --> 00:00:15,305
(beeping)

11
00:00:15,305 --> 00:00:16,138
- What's up, it's Collins Key.

12
00:00:16,138 --> 00:00:17,918
Now, today, I need some friends to help me out.

13
00:00:17,918 --> 00:00:20,041
We are going to be doing something absolutely crazy.

14
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:21,715
So, let's give this a shot.

15
00:00:21,715 --> 00:00:23,548
(screaming)

16
00:00:23,548 --> 00:00:24,381
Oh, man!

17
00:00:24,381 --> 00:00:26,075
Oh, that hurt, I'm not used to a wall

18
00:00:26,075 --> 00:00:27,188
being right there when I yee.

19
00:00:27,188 --> 00:00:28,846
My yee is just so powerful.

20
00:00:28,846 --> 00:00:31,428
(screaming)

21
00:00:31,428 --> 00:00:32,804
The wall stopped me, but today, guys,

22
00:00:32,804 --> 00:00:35,986
we are doing the Gelli Baff Challenge with a sour twist.

23
00:00:35,986 --> 00:00:39,024
Yes, this is baff, B-A-F-F, I don't know why.

24
00:00:39,024 --> 00:00:40,003
Right now, we have a challenge

25
00:00:40,003 --> 00:00:41,716
for you! - You!

26
00:00:41,716 --> 00:00:43,028
- We wanna see if you can subscribe

27
00:00:43,028 --> 00:00:45,411
and turn on the channel post notifications

28
00:00:45,411 --> 00:00:46,494
in five seconds.

29
00:00:46,494 --> 00:00:48,505
All you got, five seconds, here we go.

30
00:00:48,505 --> 00:00:49,377
Five,

31
00:00:49,377 --> 00:00:50,210
four,

32
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:51,043
three,

33
00:00:51,043 --> 00:00:52,169
two, one,

34
00:00:52,169 --> 00:00:53,002
done.

35
00:00:53,002 --> 00:00:54,163
If you can do that, comment down below

36
00:00:54,163 --> 00:00:56,185
Keyper Squad right now, and make sure you guys go follow

37
00:00:56,185 --> 00:00:57,464
all of us on Instagram.

38
00:00:57,464 --> 00:01:00,297
Show my friends some love over here, also my brother,

39
00:01:00,297 --> 00:01:01,130
yeah, show love to everyone.

40
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:01,963
Yay, no, I'm jokin'.

41
00:01:01,963 --> 00:01:03,907
Alright, let's get into this video.

42
00:01:03,907 --> 00:01:06,023
The point of this challenge, we have eight ping pong balls

43
00:01:06,023 --> 00:01:07,588
that are being submerged in the gelli baff,

44
00:01:07,588 --> 00:01:09,160
and then mixed all around.

45
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,607
Five of them are yellow.

46
00:01:10,607 --> 00:01:12,165
If you pick a yellow ping pong ball,

47
00:01:12,165 --> 00:01:14,511
you have to eat a piece of sour candy.

48
00:01:14,511 --> 00:01:15,673
Two of them are pink.

49
00:01:15,673 --> 00:01:16,856
If you pick one of those, you get to eat

50
00:01:16,856 --> 00:01:18,859
a sweet piece of candy,

51
00:01:18,859 --> 00:01:21,414
and there is one final one, and that is purple.

52
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:24,929
If you pick a purple one, you get the bag of mystery.

53
00:01:24,929 --> 00:01:26,170
- Dun, dun, dun!

54
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,641
- We don't know what's gonna be inside the bag of mystery.

55
00:01:28,641 --> 00:01:29,857
Each round, it'll change.

56
00:01:29,857 --> 00:01:32,832
It could be really good, really bad, we have no idea.

57
00:01:32,832 --> 00:01:34,000
So, right now, let's jump into this,

58
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,837
and let's submerge all of the ping pong balls

59
00:01:35,837 --> 00:01:38,056
into the jello, or gelli?

60
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:41,557
What is this void in the oobleck or in the substance.

61
00:01:41,557 --> 00:01:42,390
(screams)

62
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:43,721
Alright guys, here we go, round number one,

63
00:01:43,721 --> 00:01:45,297
everyone raise your right hands.

64
00:01:45,297 --> 00:01:46,445
One the count of three, we're just gonna stick it

65
00:01:46,445 --> 00:01:47,862
in the stuff and try to find a ball, and then.

66
00:01:47,862 --> 00:01:49,190
(laughing)

67
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:50,393
Pretty easy game playin'.

68
00:01:50,393 --> 00:01:51,670
Three!

69
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,503
- [Christian] Three, what?

70
00:01:53,503 --> 00:01:54,526
- I got one, I got one.

71
00:01:54,526 --> 00:01:55,359
- I got one.

72
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:56,319
- I got one, so everyone get one.

73
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:57,838
- Here we go, three, two, pull it out.

74
00:01:57,838 --> 00:01:58,671
No! - No!

75
00:01:59,671 --> 00:02:00,504
- Yes!

76
00:02:00,504 --> 00:02:02,513
- Alright, so, we all got sour candy,

77
00:02:02,513 --> 00:02:04,538
and so, Christian got the only sweet one.

78
00:02:04,538 --> 00:02:05,371
- Yeah!

79
00:02:05,371 --> 00:02:06,204
- Not cool.

80
00:02:06,204 --> 00:02:07,912
Alright, guys, so Christian gets to eat

81
00:02:07,912 --> 00:02:10,457
a delicious chocolate frog from Harry Potter.

82
00:02:10,457 --> 00:02:12,365
We have to eat Toxic Waste.

83
00:02:12,365 --> 00:02:13,645
So, I think we're all gonna do it all at once.

84
00:02:13,645 --> 00:02:14,623
Alright, here we go.

85
00:02:14,623 --> 00:02:15,634
Three,

86
00:02:15,634 --> 00:02:18,128
two, oh this is not good,

87
00:02:18,128 --> 00:02:18,961
one, go!

88
00:02:21,031 --> 00:02:22,375
(screaming)

89
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:23,654
- Oh, oh my god.

90
00:02:23,654 --> 00:02:25,904
(grunting)

91
00:02:26,872 --> 00:02:27,879
- I love chocolate.

92
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:29,007
- My mouth is on fire!

93
00:02:29,007 --> 00:02:30,563
- My eyes are actually watering, guys.

94
00:02:30,563 --> 00:02:32,033
There we go, that is round number one.

95
00:02:32,033 --> 00:02:32,866
Whoa, that's intense.

96
00:02:32,866 --> 00:02:34,015
One more thing I wanna let you guys know about.

97
00:02:34,015 --> 00:02:35,467
My eyes are actually watering.

98
00:02:35,467 --> 00:02:37,528
At the end of this, we are doing a lightning round.

99
00:02:37,528 --> 00:02:39,700
It's gonna be three yellow balls, one red one.

100
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,892
After each round, we're gonna use whatever sour ingredient

101
00:02:41,892 --> 00:02:43,651
was used to the bucket of doom.

102
00:02:43,651 --> 00:02:45,045
So, kicking off, we have Warheads.

103
00:02:45,045 --> 00:02:46,439
(dramatic string music)

104
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:48,836
Whoever picks the red one has to eat all of the sour candy,

105
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:51,336
but right now, we're onto round number two.

106
00:02:51,336 --> 00:02:52,169
I want a sweet one.

107
00:02:52,169 --> 00:02:53,207
I want a sweet one so bad.

108
00:02:53,207 --> 00:02:55,876
Alright, guys, raise your hand, and begin!

109
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:57,241
I wanna, I want, no, no!

110
00:02:57,241 --> 00:02:58,244
- [Devin] I'm goin' for that one!

111
00:02:58,244 --> 00:02:59,134
- Tell me when everyone has one,

112
00:02:59,134 --> 00:02:59,967
and we'll go for there, guys.

113
00:02:59,967 --> 00:03:01,089
You ready, okay, I got one.

114
00:03:01,089 --> 00:03:01,922
- Got one. - Got one.

115
00:03:01,922 --> 00:03:02,837
- Three two one, go!

116
00:03:02,837 --> 00:03:05,088
- Oh, I got it! - Ah!

117
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,577
- No! - No!

118
00:03:06,577 --> 00:03:08,574
- Wait, but that's not necessarily a good thing.

119
00:03:08,574 --> 00:03:09,407
- Well, I guess we're gonna find out.

120
00:03:09,407 --> 00:03:10,260
Now, we get the bag of mystery.

121
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,442
So, first of all, we both got sour, Devin got sweet,

122
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,275
and you got mystery.

123
00:03:13,275 --> 00:03:15,633
So, I guess we're gonna find what it is, here we go.

124
00:03:15,633 --> 00:03:17,507
Devin, what did you get for your sweet item?

125
00:03:17,507 --> 00:03:19,260
- I got some chocolate mixed

126
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,373
with some salt and potato chips.

127
00:03:21,373 --> 00:03:23,425
- So, we have to eat Sour Farts.

128
00:03:23,425 --> 00:03:24,508
- Yay.

129
00:03:24,508 --> 00:03:25,341
(laughing)

130
00:03:25,341 --> 00:03:26,174
- And Christian's been waiting.

131
00:03:26,174 --> 00:03:27,225
He doesn't know what he got yet.

132
00:03:27,225 --> 00:03:28,945
So, he gets the anticipation and the build up.

133
00:03:28,945 --> 00:03:30,412
So, right now, we're gonna open these up,

134
00:03:30,412 --> 00:03:31,416
and then, we're gonna go for it,

135
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:32,664
and then, we have to see what Christian got

136
00:03:32,664 --> 00:03:33,797
in his bag of mystery.

137
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:34,630
I'm so sorry.

138
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:37,527
- This is like a Willy Wonka

139
00:03:37,527 --> 00:03:39,445
chocolate factory

140
00:03:39,445 --> 00:03:40,859
bar. - That looks delicious, bro.

141
00:03:40,859 --> 00:03:41,849
- I'm so jealous.

142
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:43,161
- It's got the gold on there.

143
00:03:43,161 --> 00:03:43,994
- Oh my gosh.

144
00:03:43,994 --> 00:03:45,262
It smells like a fart!

145
00:03:45,262 --> 00:03:47,096
(sniffing)

146
00:03:47,096 --> 00:03:48,841
Here we go, three, cheers.

147
00:03:48,841 --> 00:03:50,339
- Cheers. - Cheers, guys?

148
00:03:50,339 --> 00:03:51,172
- No.

149
00:03:51,172 --> 00:03:52,422
- Two, one, go!

150
00:03:54,952 --> 00:03:56,534
- [Christian] Gotta see this.

151
00:03:56,534 --> 00:03:57,367
- Mm.

152
00:03:58,749 --> 00:03:59,752
(gagging)

153
00:03:59,752 --> 00:04:01,068
(laughing)

154
00:04:01,068 --> 00:04:02,324
- This is so good.

155
00:04:02,324 --> 00:04:03,157
(gagging)

156
00:04:03,157 --> 00:04:04,785
- Look at your tongue, look at your tongue.

157
00:04:04,785 --> 00:04:06,298
(exclaiming)

158
00:04:06,298 --> 00:04:08,118
Yeah, my tongue looks like how I feel right now,

159
00:04:08,118 --> 00:04:08,951
just messed up!

160
00:04:08,951 --> 00:04:09,784
Alright, here we go.

161
00:04:09,784 --> 00:04:10,917
Now, it's time for the bag of mystery.

162
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,708
Christian, you get you find out what you got.

163
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:15,079
It could be good, could be bad.

164
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:16,130
- What is it?

165
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,924
- Chocolate Dipped Insects?

166
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,236
- Oh!

167
00:04:19,236 --> 00:04:20,069
- What?

168
00:04:20,069 --> 00:04:20,902
- Oh my gosh

169
00:04:20,902 --> 00:04:21,735
- Why?

170
00:04:21,735 --> 00:04:22,568
How many do I have to eat?

171
00:04:22,568 --> 00:04:24,510
- Dude, we took a handful. - All of them.

172
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,343
- Put all of them--

173
00:04:25,343 --> 00:04:26,464
- I mean, I took at least five

174
00:04:26,464 --> 00:04:27,783
or six bites of mine. - Christian, you should

175
00:04:27,783 --> 00:04:29,201
- pretend it's the potato ships.

176
00:04:29,201 --> 00:04:30,851
It's crunchy! - Yeah!

177
00:04:30,851 --> 00:04:32,666
- No, there's legs sticking out of 'em.

178
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:33,943
- It just gives it extra texture.

179
00:04:33,943 --> 00:04:35,805
It's like a fun little

180
00:04:35,805 --> 00:04:36,638
surprising little treat.

181
00:04:36,638 --> 00:04:37,699
Never know what's gonna pop out of it.

182
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:39,667
Alright, here we go, three

183
00:04:39,667 --> 00:04:40,855
two, - No!

184
00:04:40,855 --> 00:04:41,688
- One, go!

185
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:45,050
- Oh, the noise!

186
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,014
- It tastes like things it shouldn't taste like.

187
00:04:47,014 --> 00:04:47,847
(laughing)

188
00:04:47,847 --> 00:04:49,394
- Yo, ya'll better give this video a thumbs up

189
00:04:49,394 --> 00:04:50,587
for the fact that Christian just ate

190
00:04:50,587 --> 00:04:51,766
a ton of crickets.

191
00:04:51,766 --> 00:04:53,753
- The aftertaste tastes like wet dog.

192
00:04:53,753 --> 00:04:55,003
- Like wet dog?

193
00:04:55,842 --> 00:04:57,312
- You had a leg on your lip.

194
00:04:57,312 --> 00:04:58,688
- Oh!

195
00:04:58,688 --> 00:04:59,660
Bro, I'm gonna be sick.

196
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,493
Alright, guys.

197
00:05:00,493 --> 00:05:01,517
Christian, you're a trooper.

198
00:05:01,517 --> 00:05:03,767
We're moving on right now to round number three.

199
00:05:03,767 --> 00:05:05,338
(dramatic string music)

200
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:09,029
I have one goal, and that is to not get a sour one.

201
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:09,862
- Same. - So here we go.

202
00:05:09,862 --> 00:05:10,695
Three, two, one, go!

203
00:05:10,695 --> 00:05:11,698
I need to find another one.

204
00:05:11,698 --> 00:05:13,373
Oh, it shot in my eye!

205
00:05:13,373 --> 00:05:15,651
- You splashed it everywhere!

206
00:05:15,651 --> 00:05:17,110
No!

207
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:19,155
- No, I need one, a new one. - Yes!

208
00:05:19,155 --> 00:05:19,988
- No!

209
00:05:19,988 --> 00:05:21,351
I can't even find one!

210
00:05:21,351 --> 00:05:22,866
Are there enough in here?

211
00:05:22,866 --> 00:05:24,920
I literally can't, I found Christian's hand.

212
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,708
I can't find it!

213
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:27,541
- Here's one.

214
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:28,518
- No, I want that one.

215
00:05:28,518 --> 00:05:29,351
I want it, no, no, no!

216
00:05:29,351 --> 00:05:30,184
Where'd it go, you got it?

217
00:05:30,184 --> 00:05:31,384
- Yeah! - No!

218
00:05:31,384 --> 00:05:32,746
- I got another sour one!

219
00:05:32,746 --> 00:05:34,182
- I got another mystery!

220
00:05:34,182 --> 00:05:35,406
(laughs)

221
00:05:35,406 --> 00:05:36,789
- Ow, oh gosh, tweaked my shoulder.

222
00:05:36,789 --> 00:05:38,663
So, Ava got her very first sweet piece of candy.

223
00:05:38,663 --> 00:05:39,496
What'd you get?

224
00:05:39,496 --> 00:05:41,885
- Marshmallow chocolate something.

225
00:05:41,885 --> 00:05:43,518
- That sounds delicious. - That sounds pretty good.

226
00:05:43,518 --> 00:05:44,859
- Devin and I got Smog Balls,

227
00:05:44,859 --> 00:05:46,908
which I think I know, we love these ones,

228
00:05:46,908 --> 00:05:47,964
and Christian got the mystery bag.

229
00:05:47,964 --> 00:05:50,435
You get to open it up first, Christian.

230
00:05:50,435 --> 00:05:51,398
- A paper. - A paper!

231
00:05:51,398 --> 00:05:52,664
- What does it say?

232
00:05:52,664 --> 00:05:56,420
- God card, you get to switch everyone's candy.

233
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,472
- What?

234
00:05:57,472 --> 00:05:59,802
- Okay, so, Ava and Collins

235
00:05:59,802 --> 00:06:01,298
are doing the Smog Balls.

236
00:06:01,298 --> 00:06:02,445
- Why me?

237
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,049
- Bro, I'm your sister!

238
00:06:04,049 --> 00:06:07,103
- Oh my gosh. - You get the chocolate.

239
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:09,214
- You're my sister, and I don't like you.

240
00:06:09,214 --> 00:06:11,116
- Family, I am so sorry.

241
00:06:11,116 --> 00:06:12,145
What have you done to us, Christian,

242
00:06:12,145 --> 00:06:13,312
this is not cool, bro.

243
00:06:13,312 --> 00:06:14,145
Alright, here we go.

244
00:06:14,145 --> 00:06:15,692
Three,

245
00:06:15,692 --> 00:06:16,958
two,

246
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:17,791
one.

247
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,657
(exclaiming)

248
00:06:23,577 --> 00:06:24,787
- This is really good.

249
00:06:24,787 --> 00:06:26,183
(gagging)

250
00:06:26,183 --> 00:06:27,016
- That doesn't taste like candy,

251
00:06:27,016 --> 00:06:28,433
it tastes like...

252
00:06:29,846 --> 00:06:31,436
Oh my god. - Oh my god!

253
00:06:31,436 --> 00:06:32,664
- Bro, Christian?

254
00:06:32,664 --> 00:06:33,564
- Yo.

255
00:06:33,564 --> 00:06:34,664
- If I ever get that wildcard one,

256
00:06:34,664 --> 00:06:36,412
you are going down, bro!

257
00:06:36,412 --> 00:06:39,125
You are going, I have yet to get a sweet one, fam!

258
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:41,327
(dramatic string music)

259
00:06:41,327 --> 00:06:42,218
Alright guys, here we go.

260
00:06:42,218 --> 00:06:43,621
I want a sweet one, go!

261
00:06:43,621 --> 00:06:44,458
I gotta find a sweet one.

262
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:45,457
- [Devin] No, you got a head start!

263
00:06:45,457 --> 00:06:47,503
- I can't even find another one.

264
00:06:47,503 --> 00:06:48,747
- No!

265
00:06:48,747 --> 00:06:49,580
- Yes!

266
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,413
- Here we go, hold on, here we go.

267
00:06:50,413 --> 00:06:52,747
I don't know what it is.

268
00:06:52,747 --> 00:06:53,580
No!

269
00:06:54,862 --> 00:06:56,139
Christian, what do you have?

270
00:06:56,139 --> 00:06:58,715
I got a gummy pizza, a gummy hot dog,

271
00:06:58,715 --> 00:07:00,409
and a gummy burger.

272
00:07:00,409 --> 00:07:02,049
- Sounds terrible, let's go.

273
00:07:02,049 --> 00:07:03,382
Three, two, one.

274
00:07:05,653 --> 00:07:08,070
(exclaiming)

275
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:10,399
(laughing)

276
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:11,998
No, no, no!

277
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:13,238
This is a no!

278
00:07:13,238 --> 00:07:14,752
This is a no!

279
00:07:14,752 --> 00:07:16,333
Ingredient number one,

280
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:18,357
death, death, death!

281
00:07:18,357 --> 00:07:20,288
(dramatic string music)

282
00:07:20,288 --> 00:07:21,503
I don't know what I'm doing wrong,

283
00:07:21,503 --> 00:07:22,423
but I'm doing something wrong.

284
00:07:22,423 --> 00:07:23,256
Go!

285
00:07:24,413 --> 00:07:26,373
No, no, no, come on, please, please, please, please.

286
00:07:26,373 --> 00:07:27,206
Please, please, please, please.

287
00:07:27,206 --> 00:07:28,039
- No!

288
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:29,232
- I got another one!

289
00:07:29,232 --> 00:07:30,232
- No! - Yes!

290
00:07:31,424 --> 00:07:32,392
- Woo-hoo!

291
00:07:32,392 --> 00:07:33,801
How did you get another purple one,

292
00:07:33,801 --> 00:07:34,738
Christian? - I don't even know.

293
00:07:34,738 --> 00:07:35,690
- I like purple!

294
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,744
- I can not be more enthused right now.

295
00:07:37,744 --> 00:07:39,368
I got chocolate.

296
00:07:39,368 --> 00:07:40,216
That's a word, right?

297
00:07:40,216 --> 00:07:41,049
- Yeah.

298
00:07:41,049 --> 00:07:41,989
- Yeah, alright cool.

299
00:07:41,989 --> 00:07:43,351
This has got orange bits in it.

300
00:07:43,351 --> 00:07:46,176
I love orange, and I love chocolate, and I am excited.

301
00:07:46,176 --> 00:07:47,009
What'd you get, Devin.

302
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:49,568
- I got Warheads Sour Pucker Packs.

303
00:07:49,568 --> 00:07:50,401
- Yay.

304
00:07:50,401 --> 00:07:51,261
- Ava get that too?

305
00:07:51,261 --> 00:07:52,359
- Yeah, and we literally have

306
00:07:52,359 --> 00:07:54,230
to dump the whole, ahh.

307
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,171
- And then, Christian.

308
00:07:55,171 --> 00:07:57,240
Again, I don't know how it happened, got the mystery bag.

309
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,393
So, let's find out what's inside it.

310
00:08:00,393 --> 00:08:01,567
- Ant candy.

311
00:08:01,567 --> 00:08:02,400
- Oh! - Oh!

312
00:08:03,388 --> 00:08:06,013
- There are dead ants in it!

313
00:08:06,013 --> 00:08:07,636
- Wait, wait, wait, let me see this, bro,

314
00:08:07,636 --> 00:08:08,482
there's no way.

315
00:08:08,482 --> 00:08:10,215
- There are dead ants. - Oh my gosh!

316
00:08:10,215 --> 00:08:11,154
- Those are big!

317
00:08:11,154 --> 00:08:12,268
- Look at the ingredients.

318
00:08:12,268 --> 00:08:13,867
Syrup and black ants.

319
00:08:13,867 --> 00:08:15,096
(laughing)

320
00:08:15,096 --> 00:08:17,048
- Natural artificially flavored!

321
00:08:17,048 --> 00:08:18,711
- Fam, I got terrible stuff this whole time,

322
00:08:18,711 --> 00:08:19,850
so I'm really excited.

323
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:21,050
- Everyone's throwing me bugs.

324
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:21,883
- Cheers. - Alright, here we go.

325
00:08:21,883 --> 00:08:23,216
Three, two, one.

326
00:08:27,233 --> 00:08:29,483
(coughing)

327
00:08:30,748 --> 00:08:31,800
- It's in the bag of my throat.

328
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,050
- Oh, it burns.

329
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:33,960
- You know, I'm enjoying this.

330
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,014
(laughing)

331
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,503
(dramatic string music)

332
00:08:36,503 --> 00:08:37,627
- And, begin!

333
00:08:37,627 --> 00:08:40,941
I got one, I got one, I'm ready to go, I'm ready to go.

334
00:08:40,941 --> 00:08:42,564
Three, two, one.

335
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:43,397
- No! - No!

336
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:45,533
- Why?

337
00:08:45,533 --> 00:08:46,533
- I got sour!

338
00:08:46,533 --> 00:08:48,050
- How did he get sweet again?

339
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:49,986
- You got wild card, though.

340
00:08:49,986 --> 00:08:51,553
You better hope it's a good one.

341
00:08:51,553 --> 00:08:53,344
This is a brand new sour candy.

342
00:08:53,344 --> 00:08:55,366
Devin and I have never tried in a video.

343
00:08:55,366 --> 00:08:57,820
It's called Warheads Super Sour Double Drops,

344
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,174
and the ingredients are literally acid,

345
00:09:00,174 --> 00:09:03,061
like malic acid, just, a lot of acid.

346
00:09:03,061 --> 00:09:05,032
- I got chocolate and wait, oh, what?

347
00:09:05,032 --> 00:09:05,865
- What is that?

348
00:09:05,865 --> 00:09:07,901
- There's new coins!

349
00:09:07,901 --> 00:09:09,575
Ah, they're crunchy.

350
00:09:09,575 --> 00:09:10,408
- Keep enjoying that.

351
00:09:10,408 --> 00:09:12,241
Ava, what did you get?

352
00:09:13,084 --> 00:09:14,218
Oh! - Oh!

353
00:09:14,218 --> 00:09:15,502
- Oh my gosh!

354
00:09:15,502 --> 00:09:17,292
So guys, this is the the Bean Boozled challenge.

355
00:09:17,292 --> 00:09:18,338
For those of you that don't know,

356
00:09:18,338 --> 00:09:20,145
half of the beans are delicious,

357
00:09:20,145 --> 00:09:22,694
half of them are horrible.

358
00:09:22,694 --> 00:09:25,174
So, we are gonna take this to the next level,

359
00:09:25,174 --> 00:09:26,926
and we're not playing around with beginner ones.

360
00:09:26,926 --> 00:09:29,782
We are only playing around with the black color,

361
00:09:29,782 --> 00:09:32,615
which is either skunk or black liquorice.

362
00:09:32,615 --> 00:09:34,227
- Oh no! - Oh my goodness.

363
00:09:34,227 --> 00:09:35,768
- Here we go, not excited.

364
00:09:35,768 --> 00:09:40,287
Three, two, one, go for it, and I'll go next.

365
00:09:40,287 --> 00:09:44,069
- [Christian] Oh my gosh, you just put like 20 of them in.

366
00:09:44,069 --> 00:09:46,402
(screaming)

367
00:09:50,452 --> 00:09:52,698
- Ah, it gets worse!

368
00:09:52,698 --> 00:09:54,127
Oh!

369
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:55,222
- Ah!

370
00:09:55,222 --> 00:09:56,860
- Yo, Christian, you want some?

371
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:57,693
- No!

372
00:09:57,693 --> 00:09:59,636
- You got no sour candy this whole round, bro.

373
00:09:59,636 --> 00:10:00,697
Give it a shot!

374
00:10:00,697 --> 00:10:01,551
- Oh, come on!

375
00:10:01,551 --> 00:10:05,128
- Dude, it has a lot, a lot! - I'm gonna try some of it.

376
00:10:05,128 --> 00:10:05,961
- Oh! - Oh!

377
00:10:07,055 --> 00:10:08,013
- Oh my god!

378
00:10:08,013 --> 00:10:10,846
(gagging)

379
00:10:10,846 --> 00:10:12,663
Oh my god, oh my god.

380
00:10:12,663 --> 00:10:13,882
- Alright, Christian is back now,

381
00:10:13,882 --> 00:10:15,473
and Ava, it's time for you to find out

382
00:10:15,473 --> 00:10:17,771
whether or not you got a good Bean Boozled,

383
00:10:17,771 --> 00:10:18,604
or a bad one.

384
00:10:18,604 --> 00:10:20,771
So, here we go, drum roll.

385
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:24,208
- What?

386
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,888
- I proud, no, I'm happy for her.

387
00:10:26,888 --> 00:10:28,375
She's gotten all bad stuff this whole time.

388
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:30,346
So right now, we're onto the next round.

389
00:10:30,346 --> 00:10:31,474
Let's go!

390
00:10:31,474 --> 00:10:33,477
(dramatic string music)

391
00:10:33,477 --> 00:10:34,310
Everyone hands up!

392
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:35,287
And go!

393
00:10:35,287 --> 00:10:36,883
Alright, guys, here we go, you got one?

394
00:10:36,883 --> 00:10:38,415
- [Devin] Uh, yes.

395
00:10:38,415 --> 00:10:40,318
- Alright, here we go, three, two, one, go!

396
00:10:40,318 --> 00:10:41,151
- No! - Oh!

397
00:10:42,443 --> 00:10:43,276
- Really?

398
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:44,109
- I don't know, this could be good,

399
00:10:44,109 --> 00:10:45,516
this could not be good.

400
00:10:45,516 --> 00:10:47,199
- I literally gotten sour ones every time.

401
00:10:47,199 --> 00:10:49,229
- Christian finally got his first sour one, yes!

402
00:10:49,229 --> 00:10:50,372
- Ah!

403
00:10:50,372 --> 00:10:52,894
- Okay, so, apparently, we have to do Cry Babies,

404
00:10:52,894 --> 00:10:55,563
and these things are absolutely the worst!

405
00:10:55,563 --> 00:10:57,149
- And hopefully, in the bag of mystery,

406
00:10:57,149 --> 00:10:58,256
I get something sweet.

407
00:10:58,256 --> 00:10:59,696
Let's see here.

408
00:10:59,696 --> 00:11:00,807
It's a paper, yay!

409
00:11:00,807 --> 00:11:01,876
Oh, sorry.

410
00:11:01,876 --> 00:11:04,126
(laughing)

411
00:11:05,622 --> 00:11:07,168
- He's recovering.

412
00:11:07,168 --> 00:11:08,001
- No!

413
00:11:09,762 --> 00:11:10,595
- What?

414
00:11:10,595 --> 00:11:11,428
Oh!

415
00:11:13,234 --> 00:11:16,093
- I have to eat everyone's sour candy!

416
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:18,212
- That's like, the whole box of this.

417
00:11:18,212 --> 00:11:19,277
- Yay!

418
00:11:19,277 --> 00:11:22,194
(soft piano music)

419
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:24,705
Fam,

420
00:11:24,705 --> 00:11:25,610
pray for me.

421
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:26,558
Alright, all of em?

422
00:11:26,558 --> 00:11:28,808
Alright, here we go. - Chug.

423
00:11:30,355 --> 00:11:32,946
- Yep, I can confirm that's all of them.

424
00:11:32,946 --> 00:11:35,363
(exclaiming)

425
00:11:36,256 --> 00:11:37,089
- Oh,

426
00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:38,178
oh!

427
00:11:38,178 --> 00:11:39,069
- You missed one.

428
00:11:39,069 --> 00:11:40,152
- Oh, mm, oh!

429
00:11:41,908 --> 00:11:42,741
Oh, oh!

430
00:11:44,285 --> 00:11:45,679
- He's tearing up the box.

431
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:47,179
- Okay, oh, uh uh.

432
00:11:48,175 --> 00:11:49,474
I love this challenge.

433
00:11:49,474 --> 00:11:51,698
(dramatic string music)

434
00:11:51,698 --> 00:11:54,057
This is the final lightning round right now.

435
00:11:54,057 --> 00:11:56,286
How this works, there are three yellow balls,

436
00:11:56,286 --> 00:11:57,632
one pink one.

437
00:11:57,632 --> 00:11:58,812
You get that pink ball,

438
00:11:58,812 --> 00:12:01,603
you have to eat all of the sour candy that we used

439
00:12:01,603 --> 00:12:02,683
throughout this video.

440
00:12:02,683 --> 00:12:04,441
If you get a yellow one, you're safe.

441
00:12:04,441 --> 00:12:05,761
Here we go, guys, three, two, one, go!

442
00:12:05,761 --> 00:12:06,594
This is the round!

443
00:12:06,594 --> 00:12:07,427
I got one.

444
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:08,260
I'm holding onto it.

445
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,866
I've got a good feeling about it.

446
00:12:09,866 --> 00:12:12,190
Three, two, one, open.

447
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,023
Oh! - Oh!

448
00:12:14,561 --> 00:12:16,707
- Oh, the goal was not to get the pink one.

449
00:12:16,707 --> 00:12:18,461
(laughing)

450
00:12:18,461 --> 00:12:19,749
- This is the perfect payback,

451
00:12:19,749 --> 00:12:22,888
'cause Christian all the best stuff

452
00:12:22,888 --> 00:12:24,162
throughout this entire game,

453
00:12:24,162 --> 00:12:27,074
so you have to now eat every piece of sour candy.

454
00:12:27,074 --> 00:12:29,802
You guys want a giant baff version of this challenge,

455
00:12:29,802 --> 00:12:31,223
let's go by liking this video,

456
00:12:31,223 --> 00:12:33,614
and now the moment you've all been waiting for.

457
00:12:33,614 --> 00:12:35,937
I must say, this is like instant karma right here,

458
00:12:35,937 --> 00:12:39,242
because he got no sour candy, and he's about to get it all.

459
00:12:39,242 --> 00:12:40,833
Here you go, it's full of stuff.

460
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:41,681
You gotta do it, bro.

461
00:12:41,681 --> 00:12:44,348
Here we go, three, two, one, go!

462
00:12:48,825 --> 00:12:51,197
(screaming)

463
00:12:51,197 --> 00:12:52,143
- Oh, dude, it touched me!

464
00:12:52,143 --> 00:12:53,917
- Oh, it's goin down my leg!
