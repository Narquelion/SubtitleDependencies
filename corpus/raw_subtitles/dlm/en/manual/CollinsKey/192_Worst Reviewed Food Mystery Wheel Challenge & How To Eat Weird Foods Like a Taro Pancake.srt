1
00:00:00,217 --> 00:00:01,196
- [Collins] You challenged me to eat

2
00:00:01,196 --> 00:00:03,219
the worst reviewed century egg.

3
00:00:03,219 --> 00:00:04,507
- [Both] Ooh!

4
00:00:04,507 --> 00:00:05,340
- What!

5
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:06,561
- And you challenged me to eat the worst

6
00:00:06,561 --> 00:00:08,533
reviewed jellyfish noodles.

7
00:00:08,533 --> 00:00:09,926
My stomach's already goin'!

8
00:00:09,926 --> 00:00:11,722
- These are coming from the worst reviewed restaurants.

9
00:00:11,722 --> 00:00:12,555
Ooh!

10
00:00:12,555 --> 00:00:14,198
- [Both] Ooh no!

11
00:00:14,198 --> 00:00:15,305
- You have to eat that!

12
00:00:15,305 --> 00:00:17,536
- That looks like tar!

13
00:00:17,536 --> 00:00:19,083
And the reviews said the smell would be bad,

14
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:21,117
but this is way worse than I expected.

15
00:00:21,117 --> 00:00:22,872
- [Devan] And the reviews on mine said they would be

16
00:00:22,872 --> 00:00:24,357
rubbery and slimy.

17
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:25,910
They were not exaggerating!

18
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:27,395
- Alright, so I'm gonna be taking a bite of this thing here.

19
00:00:27,395 --> 00:00:28,637
Just kinda wanna split it open.

20
00:00:28,637 --> 00:00:30,186
- [Both] Ooh!

21
00:00:30,186 --> 00:00:33,494
- [Collins] It's like, all gooey on the inside!

22
00:00:33,494 --> 00:00:35,102
If this was a dumpling I would be excited.

23
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:35,944
But it's an egg!

24
00:00:35,944 --> 00:00:37,397
I guess just kinda like, go for it?

25
00:00:37,397 --> 00:00:38,230
I don't know.

26
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:39,063
Here we go.

27
00:00:39,063 --> 00:00:39,896
Three ...

28
00:00:39,896 --> 00:00:40,729
- [Both] Two, one.

29
00:00:40,729 --> 00:00:41,562
(squirting)

30
00:00:41,562 --> 00:00:42,395
Ooh!

31
00:00:42,395 --> 00:00:43,228
- No!

32
00:00:43,228 --> 00:00:44,061
- Whoa!

33
00:00:46,061 --> 00:00:47,382
- I feel so bad for you dude!

34
00:00:47,382 --> 00:00:49,840
- Whoa! - Are you okay?

35
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,673
I can't even speak.

36
00:00:50,673 --> 00:00:51,506
- Wait!

37
00:00:51,506 --> 00:00:52,339
- What?

38
00:00:52,339 --> 00:00:53,172
No.

39
00:00:53,172 --> 00:00:54,005
No!

40
00:00:54,005 --> 00:00:54,838
(Collins yelling) You can't say ...

41
00:00:54,838 --> 00:00:56,126
Okay, I was like, there's no way!

42
00:00:56,126 --> 00:00:57,079
- Zero stars!

43
00:00:57,079 --> 00:00:57,912
(Collins screaming)

44
00:00:57,912 --> 00:00:59,571
- Time to eat my Jellyfish noodles.

45
00:00:59,571 --> 00:01:01,673
And dude, if yours was that bad,

46
00:01:01,673 --> 00:01:03,500
I wonder how bad this is gonna be, bro.

47
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,708
Okay, while you eat that I'm gonna spin

48
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:05,737
my mystery wheel for the next food.

49
00:01:05,737 --> 00:01:06,674
Here we go!

50
00:01:06,674 --> 00:01:08,378
- Dude it's jigglin' and wigglin'.

51
00:01:08,378 --> 00:01:09,427
- Alright, let's see what my next food is!

52
00:01:09,427 --> 00:01:10,584
I've got tilapia next.

53
00:01:10,584 --> 00:01:11,417
Yo dude!

54
00:01:11,417 --> 00:01:12,686
It's a full fish!

55
00:01:12,686 --> 00:01:13,519
- Oh, wow!

56
00:01:14,663 --> 00:01:16,496
Alright, well now it's time to try mine, I guess.

57
00:01:16,496 --> 00:01:17,329
Three ...

58
00:01:17,329 --> 00:01:18,162
Two ...

59
00:01:18,162 --> 00:01:18,995
One.

60
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:20,078
- [Collins] Hope it doesn't like, sting you man.

61
00:01:20,078 --> 00:01:21,318
- Mm.

62
00:01:21,318 --> 00:01:22,151
Whoa!

63
00:01:22,151 --> 00:01:22,984
- What?

64
00:01:22,984 --> 00:01:23,942
Is it good?

65
00:01:23,942 --> 00:01:24,986
- It's super spicy!

66
00:01:24,986 --> 00:01:26,598
And it's got like, little strings in it, bro!

67
00:01:26,598 --> 00:01:27,824
- Maybe those are the things that sting you.

68
00:01:27,824 --> 00:01:28,657
- Mm-mm.

69
00:01:28,657 --> 00:01:29,615
- You don't think so?

70
00:01:29,615 --> 00:01:31,127
- So, the jellyfish was actually alright.

71
00:01:31,127 --> 00:01:32,814
It was more the spice that I didn't like.

72
00:01:32,814 --> 00:01:33,842
- I gotta eat my tilapia.

73
00:01:33,842 --> 00:01:34,973
- I hope it's something good, dude.

74
00:01:34,973 --> 00:01:35,964
- Ooh!

75
00:01:35,964 --> 00:01:36,797
- Aah!

76
00:01:36,797 --> 00:01:37,630
Wow!

77
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:38,568
- Dude, it's so bony!

78
00:01:38,568 --> 00:01:39,401
- Wait, what?

79
00:01:39,401 --> 00:01:41,586
Quesadillas a los chapulines?

80
00:01:41,586 --> 00:01:42,419
- What is that?

81
00:01:42,419 --> 00:01:43,341
- I have no clue.

82
00:01:43,341 --> 00:01:44,414
Alright, here's mine.

83
00:01:44,414 --> 00:01:45,376
Just quesadillas?

84
00:01:45,376 --> 00:01:46,545
- I found my piece of fish.

85
00:01:46,545 --> 00:01:47,528
I just gonna go for a bite on this thing.

86
00:01:47,528 --> 00:01:49,422
- And I found a bug, bro!

87
00:01:49,422 --> 00:01:50,564
- Dude! - There's a bug in here!

88
00:01:50,564 --> 00:01:51,495
- There's a bug in your food?

89
00:01:51,495 --> 00:01:52,328
- Ooh!

90
00:01:52,328 --> 00:01:53,805
My food is the bug, bro!

91
00:01:53,805 --> 00:01:54,638
- Oh my gosh!

92
00:01:54,638 --> 00:01:56,232
- It's cricket quesadillas, bro!

93
00:01:56,232 --> 00:01:57,232
- Oh my god!

94
00:01:58,355 --> 00:02:00,577
Dude, no wonder it got such a low review, bro!

95
00:02:00,577 --> 00:02:02,075
- [Devan] That's what the trampolines are!

96
00:02:02,075 --> 00:02:02,908
- Ooh!

97
00:02:02,908 --> 00:02:04,906
I don't think that's how you say it, Devan.

98
00:02:04,906 --> 00:02:06,410
Hopefully I don't get a bone because this stuff

99
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:07,243
is super bony.

100
00:02:07,243 --> 00:02:08,076
Three ..

101
00:02:08,076 --> 00:02:08,909
- [Both] Two ...

102
00:02:08,909 --> 00:02:09,742
One.

103
00:02:09,742 --> 00:02:10,575
(crunching)

104
00:02:10,575 --> 00:02:11,408
- [Devan] Ooh! (Collins grunting)

105
00:02:11,408 --> 00:02:12,241
Oh! - Ow!

106
00:02:12,241 --> 00:02:13,074
- Oh! - Ow!

107
00:02:13,074 --> 00:02:14,320
- I heard crunching and cracking!

108
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,376
You got bones.

109
00:02:15,376 --> 00:02:16,209
- Aah!

110
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:17,802
- [Both] Ooh!

111
00:02:17,802 --> 00:02:19,816
- The fish was great until I got hit with the bone.

112
00:02:19,816 --> 00:02:20,649
Ow! - Ooh!

113
00:02:20,649 --> 00:02:21,886
- Okay, lets see how yours tastes, man

114
00:02:21,886 --> 00:02:24,305
- I can't believe I have to take a bite of this thing.

115
00:02:24,305 --> 00:02:25,400
- Well, I've got a blender here.

116
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,771
We're going to be adding these ingredients in

117
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:28,075
and drinking it at the end of the video.

118
00:02:28,075 --> 00:02:28,908
- And I have to blend this up?

119
00:02:28,908 --> 00:02:30,551
- [Collins] We gotta blend up your crickets stuff, bro.

120
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:32,032
But right no you gotta take a bite of that.

121
00:02:32,032 --> 00:02:32,865
- Ready?

122
00:02:32,865 --> 00:02:33,698
Set.

123
00:02:33,698 --> 00:02:34,531
Go.

124
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:37,062
- Ooh, man!

125
00:02:37,062 --> 00:02:38,061
(Devan grunting) Ooh!

126
00:02:38,061 --> 00:02:38,894
I can see his legs!

127
00:02:38,894 --> 00:02:39,727
Oh my gosh!

128
00:02:39,727 --> 00:02:40,560
Oh my gosh!

129
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,475
- If you don't think about it,

130
00:02:41,475 --> 00:02:43,032
it tastes like a crunchy quesadilla.

131
00:02:43,032 --> 00:02:43,865
- What?

132
00:02:43,865 --> 00:02:44,931
But I still give it a zero star bro.

133
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:46,557
Alright, right now we're on to the next one.

134
00:02:46,557 --> 00:02:49,339
- Oh, now that is a one star sushi plate.

135
00:02:49,339 --> 00:02:50,172
- Wait!

136
00:02:50,172 --> 00:02:51,005
Oh my goodness.

137
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:51,838
- Oh no, bro.

138
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:52,759
Those are the beans?

139
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:54,169
- [Both] Ooh!

140
00:02:54,169 --> 00:02:55,815
- [Collins] What is that, bro!

141
00:02:55,815 --> 00:02:57,774
It is like, gelatinous and undulating hell.

142
00:02:57,774 --> 00:02:58,642
- [Both] Ooh!

143
00:02:58,642 --> 00:03:00,360
- [Collins] Why is it stringy?

144
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,752
- [Devan] It's like spider eggs!

145
00:03:01,752 --> 00:03:03,606
Look how wack mine looks, bro.

146
00:03:03,606 --> 00:03:05,260
I can't get over this.

147
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,174
Done adding this.

148
00:03:06,174 --> 00:03:07,075
- Well how about this Devan.

149
00:03:07,075 --> 00:03:08,591
Would you like to have some of my kale?

150
00:03:08,591 --> 00:03:09,424
- No!

151
00:03:09,424 --> 00:03:10,257
No!

152
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:11,090
- Here you go, are you sure?

153
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:11,923
(both screaming) Oh my gosh!

154
00:03:11,923 --> 00:03:13,048
- [Devan] What was that? (Collins laughing)

155
00:03:13,048 --> 00:03:13,881
- Oh my gosh!

156
00:03:13,881 --> 00:03:15,687
- No way! (Collins laughing)

157
00:03:15,687 --> 00:03:17,966
I think what I'm gonna do now is try to mix it up.

158
00:03:17,966 --> 00:03:19,048
- Alright, well now it's time to

159
00:03:19,048 --> 00:03:20,302
taste my sushi and see how it ...

160
00:03:20,302 --> 00:03:21,856
Ooh my gosh it's dripping.

161
00:03:21,856 --> 00:03:23,028
See how it tastes, man.

162
00:03:23,028 --> 00:03:23,861
Three ...

163
00:03:23,861 --> 00:03:24,694
- [Both] Two ...

164
00:03:24,694 --> 00:03:25,976
One.

165
00:03:25,976 --> 00:03:26,809
- Ooh!

166
00:03:26,809 --> 00:03:27,832
No!

167
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:28,665
Uh-uh!

168
00:03:28,665 --> 00:03:29,730
- What! - No!

169
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:30,698
Uh-uh!

170
00:03:30,698 --> 00:03:31,531
- Nope!

171
00:03:31,531 --> 00:03:32,543
- Alright first I just gotta ...

172
00:03:32,543 --> 00:03:33,376
(Devan gagging)

173
00:03:33,376 --> 00:03:34,209
Gotta mix it up.

174
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:35,890
- The egg is getting it all stringy, man.

175
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:36,723
- Ready?

176
00:03:36,723 --> 00:03:37,556
Set.

177
00:03:37,556 --> 00:03:38,389
Alright, here we go.

178
00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:39,222
- Oh man!

179
00:03:39,222 --> 00:03:41,326
Oh dude, it's like it's stringing off your mouth.

180
00:03:41,326 --> 00:03:42,159
No way.

181
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:42,992
Is it good?

182
00:03:42,992 --> 00:03:44,189
- It has like, no taste.

183
00:03:44,189 --> 00:03:45,599
But a wax taste.

184
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,652
And it's like, webs.

185
00:03:46,652 --> 00:03:47,676
- Right into the blender.

186
00:03:47,676 --> 00:03:48,805
And we'll be blending it up at the end.

187
00:03:48,805 --> 00:03:49,638
Let's spin the wheel!

188
00:03:49,638 --> 00:03:50,471
And for this one you challenged us

189
00:03:50,471 --> 00:03:52,481
to try the worst reviewed French food.

190
00:03:52,481 --> 00:03:53,396
Let's see what we got here.

191
00:03:53,396 --> 00:03:54,485
- Wait, escargot?

192
00:03:54,485 --> 00:03:55,814
- I got French onion soup.

193
00:03:55,814 --> 00:03:56,922
- [Both] Ooh!

194
00:03:56,922 --> 00:03:57,985
- [Collins] What is that?

195
00:03:57,985 --> 00:03:59,054
- [Devan] I thought that would look a lot prettier.

196
00:03:59,054 --> 00:04:00,210
- Bro, looks like a liver!

197
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:01,633
Let's see what your escargot is.

198
00:04:01,633 --> 00:04:03,027
- [Devan] That's interesting.

199
00:04:03,027 --> 00:04:03,860
Ya know what?

200
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:04,811
I need to figure out what this is.

201
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:05,644
- Wait a minute.

202
00:04:05,644 --> 00:04:06,532
No way!

203
00:04:06,532 --> 00:04:08,452
Dude, there's a full onion in it!

204
00:04:08,452 --> 00:04:09,298
Well I guess it's time to taste

205
00:04:09,298 --> 00:04:10,682
the worst reviewed onion soup.

206
00:04:10,682 --> 00:04:12,004
Sorry it just dropped off, man.

207
00:04:12,004 --> 00:04:14,057
This looks like every food except soup, man.

208
00:04:14,057 --> 00:04:15,022
It looks like pasta.

209
00:04:15,022 --> 00:04:16,573
I just wanna get as much of the flavor

210
00:04:16,573 --> 00:04:18,160
in this thing as possible.

211
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,426
That is a heaping sporkful.

212
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:20,504
Alright, I guess here we go.

213
00:04:20,504 --> 00:04:21,337
Three ...

214
00:04:21,337 --> 00:04:22,170
(sniffing)

215
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,193
- Two ... - It smelled like an onion.

216
00:04:23,193 --> 00:04:24,026
One.

217
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,053
(triumphant music)

218
00:04:27,053 --> 00:04:27,886
- What?

219
00:04:27,886 --> 00:04:28,719
- Whoa!

220
00:04:28,719 --> 00:04:29,927
It is so good!

221
00:04:29,927 --> 00:04:30,760
- [Devan] Whoa!

222
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,593
You really like this stuff.

223
00:04:31,593 --> 00:04:32,426
- Mm-hmm!

224
00:04:32,426 --> 00:04:33,259
- Alright then.

225
00:04:33,259 --> 00:04:34,092
- Although it might look kinda weird,

226
00:04:34,092 --> 00:04:35,348
I give it five stars, man!

227
00:04:35,348 --> 00:04:36,777
- I don't even know how to do this.

228
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,420
I think I'm gonna maybe break it in half.

229
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,970
- [Collins] Ooh!

230
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,630
- [Both] Ooh!

231
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:43,065
- No! - What!

232
00:04:43,065 --> 00:04:44,381
Wait a minute!

233
00:04:44,381 --> 00:04:46,213
The stuff on the top is just garlic!

234
00:04:46,213 --> 00:04:47,840
- Ooh!

235
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,194
That's what it smelled like garlic!

236
00:04:49,194 --> 00:04:52,585
- [Collins] Yeah, that's the snails in the middle!

237
00:04:52,585 --> 00:04:53,418
- Think about it, Devan.

238
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,690
If they didn't put like a half inch layer of garlic

239
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:58,777
to cover up the snails, how bad do the snails taste?

240
00:04:58,777 --> 00:04:59,729
- I don't even wanna--- - You gonna pick up a snail?

241
00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:01,013
- Yeah, I don't even wanna ...

242
00:05:01,013 --> 00:05:01,846
Eww.

243
00:05:01,846 --> 00:05:03,131
- [Collins] Oh my gosh!

244
00:05:03,131 --> 00:05:04,750
- Oh, man! - Wow!

245
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,965
- [Devan] I guess I'll put it there.

246
00:05:05,965 --> 00:05:06,798
- [Collins] Yep, and then just gonna have

247
00:05:06,798 --> 00:05:08,044
to take a bite of it, Devan.

248
00:05:08,044 --> 00:05:08,877
You ready?

249
00:05:08,877 --> 00:05:10,158
- Yeah, I'm open to try somethin' new.

250
00:05:10,158 --> 00:05:11,410
Alright, three ...

251
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:12,243
Two ...

252
00:05:12,243 --> 00:05:13,076
One.

- Ready?

266
00:05:26,268 --> 00:05:27,277
Set.

267
00:05:27,277 --> 00:05:28,110
Go.

268
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,616
- [Collins] Oh my gosh!

269
00:05:29,616 --> 00:05:32,419
(crunching)

270
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:33,252
- Oh!

271
00:05:33,252 --> 00:05:34,394
(gagging)

272
00:05:34,394 --> 00:05:36,102
- What was that?

273
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:37,130
You think there's shell in it?

274
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:37,963
- Aah!

275
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:38,796
It's spicy!

276
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:39,629
- Why is it spicy?

277
00:05:39,629 --> 00:05:41,106
And why is there shell in it, bro?

278
00:05:41,106 --> 00:05:41,939
(Devan hacking)

279
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:42,815
- Its rubbery, bro.

280
00:05:42,815 --> 00:05:43,648
Wow!

281
00:05:43,648 --> 00:05:44,687
(Devan yelling)

282
00:05:44,687 --> 00:05:45,520
I give it a one.

283
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,767
- Alright, gonna add this to the blenders.

284
00:05:46,767 --> 00:05:47,666
Let's see what our next one is.

285
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:48,499
- [Both] Three ...

286
00:05:48,499 --> 00:05:49,332
Two ...

287
00:05:49,332 --> 00:05:50,165
One!

288
00:05:50,165 --> 00:05:50,998
Whoa!

289
00:05:50,998 --> 00:05:51,831
Wait, what?

290
00:05:51,831 --> 00:05:52,664
Sriracha noodles? - Yo dude,

291
00:05:52,664 --> 00:05:54,447
I have purple pancakes with green slime.

292
00:05:54,447 --> 00:05:55,836
And it's called taro pancakes.

293
00:05:55,836 --> 00:05:57,669
- [Devan] What is this?

294
00:05:57,669 --> 00:05:58,997
I think this is garlic!

295
00:05:58,997 --> 00:05:59,830
- Ew!

296
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,567
- [Devan] Wow, these are not great noodles, bro.

297
00:06:01,567 --> 00:06:02,694
- I have no clue what this is.

298
00:06:02,694 --> 00:06:04,815
It's like some sorta mystery sauce or something, man.

299
00:06:04,815 --> 00:06:05,648
Whoa!

300
00:06:05,648 --> 00:06:06,859
Dude, the green mixed with the purple

301
00:06:06,859 --> 00:06:07,993
is turning it like, brown.

302
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:10,018
Alright, well the mystery sauce is on.

303
00:06:10,018 --> 00:06:11,150
- [Devan] Now that you've added your sauce,

304
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,828
it's time to add my garlic, dude.

305
00:06:12,828 --> 00:06:14,475
Oh, it's going to be so spicy!

306
00:06:14,475 --> 00:06:16,685
- It is now time to take a bite of these

307
00:06:16,685 --> 00:06:17,603
and see how they taste.

308
00:06:17,603 --> 00:06:19,001
And so Devan I think you should go first, man.

309
00:06:19,001 --> 00:06:20,092
- Yeah, I think I should.

310
00:06:20,092 --> 00:06:20,925
Three ...

311
00:06:20,925 --> 00:06:21,758
Two ...

312
00:06:21,758 --> 00:06:22,591
One.

313
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:23,424
- That was a quick bite, bro.

314
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:25,301
(Devan whining)

315
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:26,801
- Oh, is it spicy?

316
00:06:27,938 --> 00:06:29,153
- That's so spicy!

317
00:06:29,153 --> 00:06:30,931
- Those noodles are like, super duper spicy?

318
00:06:30,931 --> 00:06:31,764
- Yeah!

319
00:06:31,764 --> 00:06:32,597
- Be careful, man.

320
00:06:32,597 --> 00:06:33,895
You're flipping your noodles everywhere, bro.

321
00:06:33,895 --> 00:06:35,474
- I give it a one!

322
00:06:35,474 --> 00:06:37,067
I mean, it is as advertised.

323
00:06:37,067 --> 00:06:38,313
- Alright, let's see how the pancake tastes.

324
00:06:38,313 --> 00:06:39,567
I can take the pancake and get all

325
00:06:39,567 --> 00:06:40,864
the weird sauce all over it.

326
00:06:40,864 --> 00:06:41,697
Just like that.

327
00:06:41,697 --> 00:06:42,930
I can just kinda go for a bite.

328
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:43,763
Here we go.

329
00:06:43,763 --> 00:06:44,596
Three ...

330
00:06:44,596 --> 00:06:45,429
- [Both] Two, one.

331
00:06:45,429 --> 00:06:46,262
- Ah!

332
00:06:46,262 --> 00:06:47,095
What does it taste like?

333
00:06:47,095 --> 00:06:47,928
Oh my gosh!

334
00:06:47,928 --> 00:06:48,761
Ten stars! - What?

335
00:06:48,761 --> 00:06:49,804
- Alright, right now we're on to the next one.

336
00:06:49,804 --> 00:06:50,637
Time to spin the wheels.

337
00:06:50,637 --> 00:06:51,470
Here we go.

338
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:52,303
- [Both] Three, two, one.

339
00:06:52,303 --> 00:06:53,386
- And for this one you challenged us

340
00:06:53,386 --> 00:06:55,596
to try the worst reviewed Italian food.

341
00:06:55,596 --> 00:06:56,587
Oh, I got purple, alright. - What'd I get?

342
00:06:56,587 --> 00:06:57,997
Bone marrow risotto, dude?

343
00:06:57,997 --> 00:06:59,890
- [Collins] I got squid ink pasta.

344
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:00,723
- Huh.

345
00:07:00,723 --> 00:07:01,613
- [Both] Whoa!

346
00:07:01,613 --> 00:07:02,991
- [Collins] You can literally pick up

347
00:07:02,991 --> 00:07:04,252
all the noodles in one hand.

348
00:07:04,252 --> 00:07:05,290
- Ooh! - Oh, dude so wait.

349
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,276
That's the bone marrow.

350
00:07:06,276 --> 00:07:07,547
- Oh, there's a hair!

351
00:07:07,547 --> 00:07:09,418
There's a little hair. - No way!

352
00:07:09,418 --> 00:07:10,503
- Dude, listen to the bread.

353
00:07:10,503 --> 00:07:11,336
Hold on.

354
00:07:11,336 --> 00:07:12,169
(knocking)

355
00:07:12,169 --> 00:07:13,002
That's like, hard as a rock.

356
00:07:13,002 --> 00:07:14,093
I just realized the stuff on the top,

357
00:07:14,093 --> 00:07:15,549
this is actual squid.

358
00:07:15,549 --> 00:07:16,709
- What is this at the bottom?

359
00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:18,168
They look like crushed up peas.

360
00:07:18,168 --> 00:07:19,415
In the reviews they did say

361
00:07:19,415 --> 00:07:21,327
that this was a little over seasoned.

362
00:07:21,327 --> 00:07:22,160
- Ooh!

363
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,993
Ooh!

364
00:07:22,993 --> 00:07:23,826
All you have to do with the noodles

365
00:07:23,826 --> 00:07:25,519
is peel them apart just like this.

366
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:28,499
- I don't know if this is normal but I see a vein.

367
00:07:28,499 --> 00:07:29,663
I don't wanna eat my veins.

368
00:07:29,663 --> 00:07:30,496
- It's like a nerve.

369
00:07:30,496 --> 00:07:32,186
To try out mine I wanna get a little bit of everything.

370
00:07:32,186 --> 00:07:34,110
I wanna get a little bit of the rock bread.

371
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:35,980
And I wanna put a little bit of noodles on here like this.

372
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,567
Of course we gotta get some bits of the squid.

373
00:07:37,567 --> 00:07:38,537
Alright, well it's time to find out what

374
00:07:38,537 --> 00:07:40,143
my squid ink noodles taste like.

375
00:07:40,143 --> 00:07:41,527
- [Devan] Dude, this is gonna be weird.

376
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:42,360
- No!

377
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,193
Dude I just noticed,

378
00:07:43,193 --> 00:07:45,425
it's a squid tentacle with suction cups on it!

379
00:07:45,425 --> 00:07:46,268
Three ...

380
00:07:46,268 --> 00:07:47,101
- [Both] Two ...

381
00:07:47,101 --> 00:07:47,934
One.

382
00:07:49,184 --> 00:07:50,375
- One!

383
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:52,143
- I lose a couple pieces, sorry.

384
00:07:52,143 --> 00:07:52,976
I'm not stalling.

385
00:07:52,976 --> 00:07:53,809
(crickets chirping)

386
00:07:53,809 --> 00:07:54,642
I'm just confused.

387
00:07:54,642 --> 00:07:55,475
Three ...

388
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,308
Two ...

389
00:07:56,308 --> 00:07:57,141
- [Both] One.

390
00:07:57,141 --> 00:07:57,974
- Ooh.

391
00:07:59,224 --> 00:08:00,083
It is?

392
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:00,916
- Okay.

393
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:01,749
- Okay.

394
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:02,582
- It's weird.

395
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:03,432
(gagging)

396
00:08:03,432 --> 00:08:04,265
(laughing)

397
00:08:04,265 --> 00:08:05,098
It's spicy!

398
00:08:05,098 --> 00:08:06,480
- I don't recommend eating this on a first date

399
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,837
because you'll end up with everything in your teeth.

400
00:08:09,837 --> 00:08:10,670
- Is it everywhere?

401
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:11,518
- Yeah, you look like a fool.

402
00:08:11,518 --> 00:08:12,537
(laughing)

403
00:08:12,537 --> 00:08:14,326
Gotta put some of this green stuff on here.

404
00:08:14,326 --> 00:08:15,610
- I still don't even know what that is.

405
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:16,443
- Alright, ready?

406
00:08:16,443 --> 00:08:17,276
Set.

407
00:08:17,276 --> 00:08:18,109
Go.

408
00:08:18,109 --> 00:08:18,942
- No, you can't just bite it!

409
00:08:18,942 --> 00:08:19,913
That is a bone!

410
00:08:19,913 --> 00:08:21,675
- I guess I just gotta use a spoon.

411
00:08:21,675 --> 00:08:22,578
- It's so weird.

412
00:08:22,578 --> 00:08:23,926
It's kinda like gelatinous in a way, man.

413
00:08:23,926 --> 00:08:25,508
- Whoa!

414
00:08:25,508 --> 00:08:26,841
Three, two, one.

415
00:08:29,737 --> 00:08:31,584
The texture is shuddering.

416
00:08:31,584 --> 00:08:34,078
- This is not a favorite of yours.

417
00:08:34,078 --> 00:08:35,223
- It's so greasy.

418
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,914
It lives up to it's one star review,

419
00:08:36,914 --> 00:08:38,292
and I give it a half a star.

420
00:08:38,292 --> 00:08:39,125
- Whoa!

421
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:40,103
Alright, we're gonna add this to the blender.

422
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:41,084
Let's spin the wheels and for this one ...

423
00:08:41,084 --> 00:08:41,917
(screaming)

424
00:08:41,917 --> 00:08:42,750
Not again! - Whoah!

425
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,754
- You challenged us to try the

426
00:08:43,754 --> 00:08:45,002
worst reviewed Chinese food.

427
00:08:45,002 --> 00:08:46,079
- [Devan] Wait, what?

428
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,369
Stinky Tofu.

429
00:08:47,369 --> 00:08:48,488
- [Collins] What, I got Tripe soup.

430
00:08:48,488 --> 00:08:50,177
I don't even know what this stuff is, man.

431
00:08:50,177 --> 00:08:51,210
Looks kinda like a brain.

432
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:52,043
I'm confused.

433
00:08:52,043 --> 00:08:54,543
- Alright, time to see if mine lives up to it's name.

434
00:08:54,543 --> 00:08:55,376
You ready?

435
00:08:55,376 --> 00:08:56,209
- Yup.

436
00:08:56,209 --> 00:08:57,230
I don't smell anything.

437
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,063
Yeah, it's not bad at all.

438
00:08:58,063 --> 00:09:00,493
- (sniffing) Ooh!

439
00:09:00,493 --> 00:09:01,752
It's like dog breath!

440
00:09:01,752 --> 00:09:02,585
Just take a whiff.

441
00:09:02,585 --> 00:09:03,418
(Collins screaming)

442
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:05,213
I can't imagine ordering this, bro.

443
00:09:05,213 --> 00:09:07,321
I feel like this would linger for a week.

444
00:09:07,321 --> 00:09:08,154
- Alright, look at that!

445
00:09:08,154 --> 00:09:09,141
Look at that hat stringy looking ...

446
00:09:09,141 --> 00:09:09,974
Agh!

447
00:09:09,974 --> 00:09:10,840
- Oh boy!

448
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,416
- Alright, time to see how this thing tastes!

449
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:13,559
So here we go, man.

450
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:14,755
- Wait, you know what this is, right?

451
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:15,588
- No, I don't.

452
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:17,791
- It's the inner lining of a cow's stomach.

453
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:18,624
- Nope, done.

454
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:19,457
That's it.

455
00:09:20,582 --> 00:09:21,726
- The mystery wheel picked it though.

456
00:09:21,726 --> 00:09:22,559
You gotta do it.

457
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:24,144
I guess I'll put some egg on mine.

458
00:09:24,144 --> 00:09:25,619
A little bit of this rice here.

459
00:09:25,619 --> 00:09:26,487
- And your stinky tofu.

460
00:09:26,487 --> 00:09:27,912
- I didn't choose the stinky life.

461
00:09:27,912 --> 00:09:30,284
Dude, I'm about to eat dog breath that's food.

462
00:09:30,284 --> 00:09:31,117
This is gonna be rough.

463
00:09:31,117 --> 00:09:31,950
You ready?

464
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:32,783
- Yep!

465
00:09:32,783 --> 00:09:33,616
- Three, two ...

466
00:09:33,616 --> 00:09:35,324
- Oh man. - One.

467
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:37,657
(crunching)

468
00:09:38,629 --> 00:09:39,620
- (laughing) Trying not to breath.

469
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,453
Is it a little bit tough?

470
00:09:40,453 --> 00:09:41,286
Oh boy.

471
00:09:41,286 --> 00:09:42,119
- It's spicy.

472
00:09:42,119 --> 00:09:42,952
- Devan doesn't like spice.

473
00:09:42,952 --> 00:09:43,785
- Man, the eggs!

474
00:09:43,785 --> 00:09:44,685
Mixed with it, man.

475
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:45,518
Oh!

476
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:46,351
Oh!

477
00:09:46,351 --> 00:09:47,184
(exhaling) - Ah, hey!

478
00:09:47,184 --> 00:09:48,017
- Does it smell good?

479
00:09:48,017 --> 00:09:48,850
- Not at all.

480
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:49,922
- My review for this would be a zero.

481
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,886
The taste is not worth the breath

482
00:09:51,886 --> 00:09:53,215
you're gonna have for a week.

483
00:09:53,215 --> 00:09:54,566
- I can attest to that.

484
00:09:54,566 --> 00:09:55,665
Your breath's pretty bad right now.

485
00:09:55,665 --> 00:09:56,505
Here we go!

486
00:09:56,505 --> 00:09:57,338
Let's see how this tastes, bro.

487
00:09:57,338 --> 00:09:59,288
I don't even know how to ...

488
00:09:59,288 --> 00:10:00,297
- (screeching) Aah!

489
00:10:00,297 --> 00:10:02,223
- That perfectly describes how you must feel right now.

490
00:10:02,223 --> 00:10:03,270
- So it I guess we just gotta go for it.

491
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,311
Three, two, one. (yelping)

492
00:10:04,311 --> 00:10:05,144
(gagging)

493
00:10:05,144 --> 00:10:05,977
(laughing)

494
00:10:05,977 --> 00:10:07,311
I have psyched myself up for this one, bro.

495
00:10:07,311 --> 00:10:08,265
A lot of emotions.

496
00:10:08,265 --> 00:10:09,098
A lot of feelings.

497
00:10:09,098 --> 00:10:09,931
A lot of energy.

498
00:10:09,931 --> 00:10:10,764
A lot of everything right now, man.

499
00:10:10,764 --> 00:10:11,597
- You can do it, you got it just--

500
00:10:11,597 --> 00:10:12,430
- I know, ah!

501
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:13,263
- Oh, wait!

502
00:10:13,263 --> 00:10:14,096
Oh yeah, Three Second Like Challenge!

503
00:10:14,096 --> 00:10:14,929
We wanna see if you can like this video

504
00:10:14,929 --> 00:10:15,762
in three seconds.

505
00:10:15,762 --> 00:10:16,595
You ready?

506
00:10:16,595 --> 00:10:17,428
Here we go.

507
00:10:17,428 --> 00:10:18,261
- [Both] Three ...

508
00:10:18,261 --> 00:10:19,094
Two ...

509
00:10:19,094 --> 00:10:19,927
One.

510
00:10:19,927 --> 00:10:20,760
Done!

511
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,593
- Dude.

512
00:10:22,653 --> 00:10:24,423
It's that little bit that's hanging.

513
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:25,384
(groaning)

514
00:10:25,384 --> 00:10:26,269
- [Devon] Ay-yi-yi!

515
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:27,102
(muffled screaming)

516
00:10:27,102 --> 00:10:27,935
Bro!

517
00:10:27,935 --> 00:10:32,025
- Yo, that was the worst thing I have ever like, texture!

518
00:10:32,025 --> 00:10:33,608
(groaning)

519
00:10:33,608 --> 00:10:34,871
Time to add the foods to the blender.

520
00:10:34,871 --> 00:10:35,704
Let's spin the wheels.

521
00:10:35,704 --> 00:10:36,788
And for this one you challenged us

522
00:10:36,788 --> 00:10:39,344
to try the worst reviewed American food.

523
00:10:39,344 --> 00:10:40,707
Ooh no!

524
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:41,540
- Wait, what?

525
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,660
Chicken fried steak?

526
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,884
- [Collins] Lobster mac and cheese.

527
00:10:43,884 --> 00:10:44,890
- [Both] Ooh!

528
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:45,723
- [Collins] What?

529
00:10:45,723 --> 00:10:46,783
It's like dripping out juice!

530
00:10:46,783 --> 00:10:47,756
Let's see what yours is.

531
00:10:47,756 --> 00:10:48,589
- Alright.

532
00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:50,146
I mean, it could look worse.

533
00:10:50,146 --> 00:10:51,491
- [Collins] It's stuck on there!

534
00:10:51,491 --> 00:10:52,464
- [Devan] Stuck on it.

535
00:10:52,464 --> 00:10:53,754
- The weirdest thing is that the mac and cheese

536
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:55,475
doesn't look creamy at all, man.

537
00:10:55,475 --> 00:10:56,529
It's just like noodles.

538
00:10:56,529 --> 00:10:57,362
No!

539
00:10:57,362 --> 00:10:58,195
Dude!

540
00:10:58,195 --> 00:10:59,028
It's got lobster meat in it,

541
00:10:59,028 --> 00:10:59,900
but look at this!

542
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,094
It's also got lobster shell.

543
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:01,927
Dude!

544
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:02,760
- You gotta watch where you eat.

545
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,593
There's other pieces of it too.

546
00:11:03,593 --> 00:11:04,426
Look at this!

547
00:11:04,426 --> 00:11:05,298
- [Devan] guess I'm gonna try to cut mine up

548
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:06,757
and see what's on the inside.

549
00:11:06,757 --> 00:11:08,329
I think that's steak on the inside.

550
00:11:08,329 --> 00:11:09,850
- As you've done that, I think it's time

551
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:10,683
to add some fresh lobster.

552
00:11:10,683 --> 00:11:11,516
Alright, there we go.

553
00:11:11,516 --> 00:11:12,349
Lobster tail--

554
00:11:12,349 --> 00:11:13,182
Aah! - Ooh!

555
00:11:13,182 --> 00:11:14,015
- Oh my gosh!

556
00:11:14,015 --> 00:11:14,848
On the inside!

557
00:11:14,848 --> 00:11:15,992
Aah!

558
00:11:15,992 --> 00:11:17,215
No! - Dude, what is that?

559
00:11:17,215 --> 00:11:18,048
No!

560
00:11:20,716 --> 00:11:21,549
That goes back!

561
00:11:21,549 --> 00:11:22,786
That is not added in my thing!

562
00:11:22,786 --> 00:11:23,619
Uh-uh!

563
00:11:23,619 --> 00:11:24,888
Right now it's time to see how the

564
00:11:24,888 --> 00:11:25,845
macaroni and cheese tastes.

565
00:11:25,845 --> 00:11:26,796
And how your chicken fried steak thing tastes.

566
00:11:26,796 --> 00:11:27,629
- [Both] Three ...

567
00:11:27,629 --> 00:11:28,462
Two ...

568
00:11:28,462 --> 00:11:29,295
One.

569
00:11:29,295 --> 00:11:30,186
(crunching)

570
00:11:30,186 --> 00:11:31,256
- It's really rubbery.

571
00:11:31,256 --> 00:11:33,372
- The reviews did say it was a little bit rubbery.

572
00:11:33,372 --> 00:11:34,515
What rating would you give it, Devan?

573
00:11:34,515 --> 00:11:36,042
Overall probably a three.

574
00:11:36,042 --> 00:11:36,875
- Dude!

575
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:37,783
That's where all the cheese went!

576
00:11:37,783 --> 00:11:39,773
It's all stuck to the bottom! - Yeah!

577
00:11:39,773 --> 00:11:41,381
- I'm gonna take a huge bite of this thing right now.

578
00:11:41,381 --> 00:11:42,214
You ready?

579
00:11:42,214 --> 00:11:43,047
Three ...

580
00:11:43,047 --> 00:11:43,880
- [Both] Two ...

581
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,713
One.

582
00:11:44,713 --> 00:11:46,164
(squishing)

583
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:46,997
- Oh.

584
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:47,830
Ugh!

585
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:48,663
- How are the noodles?

586
00:11:48,663 --> 00:11:49,496
- A little bit rubbery.

587
00:11:49,496 --> 00:11:50,621
I give this a rating of ...

588
00:11:50,621 --> 00:11:51,945
Alright, gonna add this into the blender.

589
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:53,733
Let's spin the wheel and for this one you challenged us

590
00:11:53,733 --> 00:11:55,893
to try the worst reviewed German food.

591
00:11:55,893 --> 00:11:56,752
- Alright.

592
00:11:56,752 --> 00:11:57,874
So what's yours? - What?

593
00:11:57,874 --> 00:11:58,707
I got a ham hock.

594
00:11:58,707 --> 00:11:59,833
- I got weisswurst?

595
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:00,892
- Oh, what? - Whoa!

596
00:12:00,892 --> 00:12:02,407
- So that's ham hock?

597
00:12:02,407 --> 00:12:03,672
It's got a bone in it!

598
00:12:03,672 --> 00:12:04,578
No, dude!

599
00:12:04,578 --> 00:12:06,188
I think this is like the ankle of a pig!

600
00:12:06,188 --> 00:12:07,393
- Dude, how did you now that?

601
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,516
- Bro, I study these things.

602
00:12:08,516 --> 00:12:09,887
- Alright, it's time to open up mine.

603
00:12:09,887 --> 00:12:11,032
- [Both] Whoa!

604
00:12:11,032 --> 00:12:12,381
- [Devan] Is that a soggy pretzel?

605
00:12:12,381 --> 00:12:13,653
- That's got to be the worst looking pretzel

606
00:12:13,653 --> 00:12:14,486
I've ever seen.

607
00:12:14,486 --> 00:12:16,094
- Can we even call this a pretzel?

608
00:12:16,094 --> 00:12:17,488
I didn't even realize the main event.

609
00:12:17,488 --> 00:12:19,280
These sausage looking things.

610
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,280
- Ooh! - Hey!

611
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:24,124
You can literally peel the skin off of it.

612
00:12:24,124 --> 00:12:25,184
- [Collins] Ugh!

613
00:12:25,184 --> 00:12:26,026
It's like sludge, bro!

614
00:12:26,026 --> 00:12:26,859
- [Devan] Yikes!

615
00:12:26,859 --> 00:12:29,501
Do you have any clue what these are?

616
00:12:29,501 --> 00:12:30,784
- Yeah, they're egg noodles.

617
00:12:30,784 --> 00:12:32,751
Well, now it's time for you to try your white sausages.

618
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:34,716
It's such a weird combo with the pretzel, bro.

619
00:12:34,716 --> 00:12:36,002
I'm just going to put that on the end, there.

620
00:12:36,002 --> 00:12:36,932
We got a kabob.

621
00:12:36,932 --> 00:12:37,765
Or shabob?

622
00:12:37,765 --> 00:12:38,598
I dunno, kabob?

623
00:12:38,598 --> 00:12:39,431
- (laughing) Shabob?

624
00:12:39,431 --> 00:12:40,931
- Three, two, one.

625
00:12:42,355 --> 00:12:43,188
Ugh!

626
00:12:43,188 --> 00:12:44,021
It's way too spongy.

627
00:12:44,021 --> 00:12:46,740
I would give it a zero for the soggy pretzel, bro.

628
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,533
- Alright, well now let's see how this thingy tastes.

629
00:12:48,533 --> 00:12:49,980
You know the first step, gonna have to

630
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,897
pull it apart a little bit.

631
00:12:50,897 --> 00:12:51,982
You just gotta pull it apart

632
00:12:51,982 --> 00:12:52,815
and get some different textures.

633
00:12:52,815 --> 00:12:53,940
Ooh!

634
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,111
Dude! - Ooh!

635
00:12:55,111 --> 00:12:56,704
- You pull one little bit

636
00:12:56,704 --> 00:12:58,166
and the whole thing comes apart, bro.

637
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:00,938
(both screaming)

638
00:13:00,938 --> 00:13:02,082
It's hot!

639
00:13:02,082 --> 00:13:02,973
- I think we kinda harmonized there.

640
00:13:02,973 --> 00:13:03,909
- Yeah we turned into a siren.

641
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:04,935
Oh dude that's kinda cool you can

642
00:13:04,935 --> 00:13:05,865
pull it apart like that.

643
00:13:05,865 --> 00:13:06,941
- [Both] Ooh!

644
00:13:06,941 --> 00:13:07,916
- [Devan] It's steaming!

645
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:08,776
- I'm gonna put that on there.

646
00:13:08,776 --> 00:13:09,609
It's like a little hat.

647
00:13:09,609 --> 00:13:10,442
It's going out for traveling.

648
00:13:10,442 --> 00:13:12,430
So now we're gonna of course add in

649
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:13,263
some of garnishes here.

650
00:13:13,263 --> 00:13:14,096
Let's see how this tastes.

651
00:13:14,096 --> 00:13:14,929
Here we go.

652
00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:15,762
Three ...

653
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:16,595
- [Both] Two, one.

654
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:17,441
(crunching)

655
00:13:17,441 --> 00:13:18,982
- Whoa!

656
00:13:18,982 --> 00:13:19,953
Dude!

657
00:13:19,953 --> 00:13:21,621
You took like, the whole thing with you!

658
00:13:21,621 --> 00:13:23,315
- I gotta try some of the raw part, hold on.

659
00:13:23,315 --> 00:13:24,148
- Really?

660
00:13:24,148 --> 00:13:26,299
I heard a bit of a crunch there, bro.

661
00:13:26,299 --> 00:13:28,930
- Ooh! (laughing)

662
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:31,006
It's the garnishes that ruin the dish!

663
00:13:31,006 --> 00:13:31,894
It is (gagging).

664
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:35,059
This gets two hawks out of 50.

665
00:13:35,059 --> 00:13:36,227
I'm gonna add this to the smoothie.

666
00:13:36,227 --> 00:13:38,003
We'll be blending this up and drinking it at the end.

667
00:13:38,003 --> 00:13:38,866
Spin the mystery wheels.

668
00:13:38,866 --> 00:13:40,105
And for this one you challenged us to try

669
00:13:40,105 --> 00:13:42,083
the worst reviewed Italian food.

670
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:43,089
Let's see what we got here.

671
00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:44,161
- [Devan] Shrimmp Scampi.

672
00:13:44,161 --> 00:13:45,947
- [Collins] And I got a head cheese pate plate.

673
00:13:45,947 --> 00:13:47,309
- Alright, time to pop it off and ...

674
00:13:47,309 --> 00:13:48,142
Ooh!

675
00:13:48,142 --> 00:13:48,975
What?

676
00:13:48,975 --> 00:13:50,281
- [Collins] Dude, you have like, full on shrimps in there.

677
00:13:50,281 --> 00:13:52,012
- I have a full school of shrimp in here dude.

678
00:13:52,012 --> 00:13:54,307
- And that is a head cheese pate plate.

679
00:13:54,307 --> 00:13:55,733
Oh boy!

680
00:13:55,733 --> 00:13:56,598
Dude!

681
00:13:56,598 --> 00:13:57,795
I think I've heard of headcheese before.

682
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,723
I think it's literally like, cheek meat.

683
00:13:59,723 --> 00:14:00,556
- [Devan] What?

684
00:14:00,556 --> 00:14:01,389
- Yeah.

685
00:14:01,389 --> 00:14:02,222
No!

686
00:14:02,222 --> 00:14:03,055
The noodles are actually,

687
00:14:03,055 --> 00:14:04,285
they're a little bit oily.

688
00:14:04,285 --> 00:14:07,931
- Yeah, that what it said in the reviews.

689
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:09,810
Dude, this is liver pate!

690
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:10,643
- Wait.

691
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:13,060
Liver pate?

692
00:14:14,394 --> 00:14:15,321
- This is pate combined with a head cheese

693
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:16,154
is gonna be a lot.

694
00:14:16,154 --> 00:14:17,871
Then we gotta add some pasta noodles to this thing.

695
00:14:17,871 --> 00:14:19,441
This is a head cheese sandwich right here.

696
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:20,320
So, oh boy!

697
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,221
Alright, I guess I'm gonna take a bite of this.

698
00:14:22,221 --> 00:14:23,343
So Devan, you ready to take a bite of yours?

699
00:14:23,343 --> 00:14:24,680
- Now it's time to grab some noodles.

700
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,636
I also gotta get some of this asparagus on here.

701
00:14:26,636 --> 00:14:28,327
I heard it was not the greatest asparagus.

702
00:14:28,327 --> 00:14:30,627
Maybe a little bit damp.

703
00:14:30,627 --> 00:14:31,460
Look at it.

704
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,293
It's a little soggy.

705
00:14:32,293 --> 00:14:33,126
Three ...

706
00:14:33,126 --> 00:14:33,959
Two ...

707
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:35,277
One.

708
00:14:35,277 --> 00:14:39,537
- Oh, I can hear the crunch of the asparagus in there, man.

709
00:14:39,537 --> 00:14:40,370
- It's a little oily.

710
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:41,203
- Alright, here we go.

711
00:14:41,203 --> 00:14:42,036
Three ...

712
00:14:42,036 --> 00:14:42,869
- [Both] Two ...

713
00:14:42,869 --> 00:14:44,301
One.

714
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:45,832
- Ooh!

715
00:14:45,832 --> 00:14:47,027
Okay.

716
00:14:47,027 --> 00:14:48,277
(triumphant music) - Whoa!

717
00:14:48,277 --> 00:14:49,110
- What?

718
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:50,012
What?

719
00:14:50,012 --> 00:14:50,845
- Mm!

720
00:14:50,845 --> 00:14:51,678
Oh my gosh!

721
00:14:51,678 --> 00:14:53,511
It is so good!

722
00:14:53,511 --> 00:14:54,559
- [Devan] It is just 'cause you

723
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:55,392
haven't had it before it's good?

724
00:14:55,392 --> 00:14:56,347
Or is like, it's really good?

725
00:14:56,347 --> 00:14:57,180
- Woo!

726
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,178
It may not look it, but it tastes amazing!

727
00:14:59,178 --> 00:15:00,435
This gets five stars.

728
00:15:00,435 --> 00:15:01,268
Alright let's spin the mystery wheel.

729
00:15:01,268 --> 00:15:02,531
Three, two, one.

730
00:15:02,531 --> 00:15:03,694
And for this one you challenged us

731
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,377
to try the worst of reviewed Thai food in our city.

732
00:15:06,377 --> 00:15:07,210
Let's see what we got.

733
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,043
- Wait, what?

734
00:15:08,043 --> 00:15:09,181
Oxtail soup?

735
00:15:09,181 --> 00:15:10,014
- [Collins] Fried Silk?

736
00:15:10,014 --> 00:15:12,012
Alright, so this I guess is fried silk.

737
00:15:12,012 --> 00:15:14,236
- [Devan] And this is oxtail soup.

738
00:15:14,236 --> 00:15:15,191
- Oh my gosh!

739
00:15:15,191 --> 00:15:16,686
- [Devan] There's something hard in there, bro.

740
00:15:16,686 --> 00:15:17,869
- I think I'm doing pretty good so far,

741
00:15:17,869 --> 00:15:19,552
because a lot of the reviews said that they found

742
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:20,404
weird things in food.

743
00:15:20,404 --> 00:15:21,252
Like bugs in the food.

744
00:15:21,252 --> 00:15:22,433
Or it just wasn't prepared well.

745
00:15:22,433 --> 00:15:24,065
And I feel like, all in all this is a pretty good.

746
00:15:24,065 --> 00:15:26,710
- Wait, dude, I think those are silk worms.

747
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:27,543
- No!

748
00:15:27,543 --> 00:15:28,376
Oh my gosh!

749
00:15:28,376 --> 00:15:29,209
Dude, you're right!

750
00:15:29,209 --> 00:15:30,357
Dude, that's a silk worm!

751
00:15:30,357 --> 00:15:32,350
- Alright, I think I'm gonna take bite of mine first.

752
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:33,218
- That's probably best, man.

753
00:15:33,218 --> 00:15:34,743
Because I wanna stall as long as possible

754
00:15:34,743 --> 00:15:35,838
having to eat a silk worm.

755
00:15:35,838 --> 00:15:37,141
- [Devan] So just get some of this and--

756
00:15:37,141 --> 00:15:37,974
- Wait!

757
00:15:37,974 --> 00:15:38,807
N-n-n-n-n-no, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

758
00:15:38,807 --> 00:15:40,745
You just can't eat just a little bit of the soup.

759
00:15:40,745 --> 00:15:42,026
You either got to drink it.

760
00:15:42,026 --> 00:15:44,083
Or you got to take a huge bite of that tail.

761
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:45,636
- Oh, I dropped my spoon in there.

762
00:15:45,636 --> 00:15:46,725
- See, that's a sign Devan.

763
00:15:46,725 --> 00:15:48,409
That's a sign you can't use your spoon.

764
00:15:48,409 --> 00:15:49,712
Take a bite of the oxtail first.

765
00:15:49,712 --> 00:15:51,131
And then take a bit of the soup.

766
00:15:51,131 --> 00:15:52,979
- Bro, I would honestly rather switch with you.

767
00:15:52,979 --> 00:15:54,145
Alright, he we go.

768
00:15:54,145 --> 00:15:54,978
Three ...

769
00:15:54,978 --> 00:15:55,811
- Oh boy.

770
00:15:55,811 --> 00:15:56,644
- Two ...

771
00:15:56,644 --> 00:15:58,026
- (laughing) Your voice gave you away on that one, Devan.

772
00:15:58,026 --> 00:15:58,914
- One.

773
00:15:58,914 --> 00:15:59,777
- Ooh!

774
00:15:59,777 --> 00:16:00,610
- Oh boy.

775
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:01,584
Dude, it's like it's dangling, bro.

776
00:16:01,584 --> 00:16:02,417
- Aah!

777
00:16:02,417 --> 00:16:04,168
It actually tasted like chicken to me.

778
00:16:04,168 --> 00:16:05,001
- Did you spit it out?

779
00:16:05,001 --> 00:16:06,791
Alright, well now I guess it's time to try some silkworms.

780
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:07,648
Look at that, bro.

781
00:16:07,648 --> 00:16:09,441
Look at that little ...

782
00:16:09,441 --> 00:16:10,938
- To be honest that's as bad as this.

783
00:16:10,938 --> 00:16:12,149
- Click over here to vote right now.

784
00:16:12,149 --> 00:16:13,080
Which do you think is worse?

785
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,543
Silkworms or ox right now.

786
00:16:14,543 --> 00:16:15,464
Oh, you know what I forgot?

787
00:16:15,464 --> 00:16:17,015
I gotta actually add some of the hot sauce to it.

788
00:16:17,015 --> 00:16:17,848
- Oh, man!

789
00:16:17,848 --> 00:16:18,681
- Then I guess we're gonna put a little piece

790
00:16:18,681 --> 00:16:19,514
of the cabbage.

791
00:16:19,514 --> 00:16:20,347
- Three ...

792
00:16:20,347 --> 00:16:21,180
- [Both] Two, one.

793
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,013
- But wait.

794
00:16:22,013 --> 00:16:23,870
- If you wanna win a 15 minute video call with Devan and I,

795
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:26,425
text the word worst to 81800 right now.

796
00:16:26,425 --> 00:16:29,129
So pause the video, text the word worst to 81800.

797
00:16:29,129 --> 00:16:30,472
You'll automatically be entered in to win.

798
00:16:30,472 --> 00:16:32,060
And right now, let's see how this things tastes.

799
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:32,893
Three ...

800
00:16:32,893 --> 00:16:33,726
- [Both] Two ...

801
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:35,015
One.

802
00:16:35,015 --> 00:16:35,848
Ooh!

803
00:16:35,848 --> 00:16:38,432
(laughing) - Is it really hot?

804
00:16:38,432 --> 00:16:39,477
(Collins groaning)

805
00:16:39,477 --> 00:16:40,685
It's not hot?

806
00:16:40,685 --> 00:16:41,518
Oh, it popped?

807
00:16:41,518 --> 00:16:43,061
- Ooh! (yelping)

808
00:16:43,061 --> 00:16:43,973
- Wow.

809
00:16:43,973 --> 00:16:46,180
You're very brave for doing this, Collins.

810
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,426
- Look, the actual worm itself like,

811
00:16:47,426 --> 00:16:48,632
that tastes kinda good.

812
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:49,657
This gets a rating of two stars.

813
00:16:49,657 --> 00:16:51,021
Alright, gonna add this to our blender.

814
00:16:51,021 --> 00:16:52,348
We'll be blending this up at the very end.

815
00:16:52,348 --> 00:16:53,932
And right now we're on to the next one.

816
00:16:53,932 --> 00:16:55,895
Time to blend up the worst reviewed smoothies.

817
00:16:55,895 --> 00:16:57,518
- Aah! - Ooh!

818
00:16:57,518 --> 00:16:59,235
I forgot about the squid noodles!

819
00:16:59,235 --> 00:17:00,068
- It's all ...

820
00:17:00,068 --> 00:17:00,983
Ooh!

821
00:17:00,983 --> 00:17:01,816
It's all stuck.

822
00:17:01,816 --> 00:17:04,173
- Why is it just like stuck in one cylinder, bro?

823
00:17:04,173 --> 00:17:05,248
Oh my gosh.

824
00:17:05,248 --> 00:17:07,893
We've also got the best reviewed smoothie in our city.

825
00:17:07,893 --> 00:17:09,359
And the mystery wheel's gonna decide which one

826
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,290
we have to drink.

827
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,418
But first we gotta add them to the big blender here.

828
00:17:12,418 --> 00:17:13,258
- [Both] Ooh!

829
00:17:13,258 --> 00:17:14,672
- [Devan] The escargot, man.

830
00:17:14,672 --> 00:17:16,384
- [Collins] Yo, the bread got mad soggy.

831
00:17:16,384 --> 00:17:18,297
- Oh my gosh, the chicken steak.

832
00:17:18,297 --> 00:17:19,194
- The eggs are goin' in.

833
00:17:19,194 --> 00:17:20,852
- [Devan] I don't even remember what that was.

834
00:17:20,852 --> 00:17:21,863
- Ooh, yeah.

835
00:17:21,863 --> 00:17:22,696
(gasping)

836
00:17:22,696 --> 00:17:24,658
I forgot the stomach is in there, dude.

837
00:17:24,658 --> 00:17:25,803
- Oh, no!

838
00:17:25,803 --> 00:17:27,329
We did some bad stuff with this one.

839
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:28,162
- [Collins] Ooh!

840
00:17:28,162 --> 00:17:28,995
The silk worms!

841
00:17:28,995 --> 00:17:30,154
- [Devan] It's a full snail!

842
00:17:30,154 --> 00:17:32,059
- These are gonna be the most disgusting smooties

843
00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:33,010
we've ever had to eat.

844
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,244
I'm just crossing my fingers that I get the good smoothie

845
00:17:35,244 --> 00:17:38,355
and don't have to drink this, man.

846
00:17:38,355 --> 00:17:39,937
Alright, well last spoonful is going in.

847
00:17:39,937 --> 00:17:42,264
- Oh, and the jellyfish noodles!

848
00:17:42,264 --> 00:17:43,767
- Real question is, do all these one stars

849
00:17:43,767 --> 00:17:44,910
make it a 10 star?

850
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,417
Or is it like a negative 10 stars?

851
00:17:46,417 --> 00:17:48,401
- It's a negative 10 star, dude.

852
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:50,658
- Wait, we gotta add some water though to it.

853
00:17:50,658 --> 00:17:51,585
Alright, we got the tap water.

854
00:17:51,585 --> 00:17:52,855
And now let's add this in.

855
00:17:52,855 --> 00:17:54,016
And we'll get this thing blending.

856
00:17:54,016 --> 00:17:54,849
So here we go.

857
00:17:54,849 --> 00:17:55,682
Ooh!

858
00:17:55,682 --> 00:17:56,657
- [Devan] Ooh!

859
00:17:56,657 --> 00:17:57,490
It's dripping!

860
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:58,702
- How is my pour cleaner than yours?

861
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,180
Time to turn this thing up and blend it.

862
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,194
So, how do we do this?

863
00:18:01,194 --> 00:18:02,027
Hold on.

864
00:18:02,027 --> 00:18:02,860
- [Devan] There?

865
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:03,693
(blenders whirring)

866
00:18:03,693 --> 00:18:05,151
- Aah!

867
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:06,168
Oh my gosh!

868
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,064
- [Devan] Oh, it stopped working!

869
00:18:07,064 --> 00:18:07,897
- Yours isn't working?

870
00:18:07,897 --> 00:18:08,730
- No, it stopped.

871
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:11,675
- Whoa! (blenders whirring)

872
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:12,592
Oh my gosh!

873
00:18:14,867 --> 00:18:16,045
These things are all blended up

874
00:18:16,045 --> 00:18:16,913
and oh my gosh!

875
00:18:16,913 --> 00:18:17,769
Ooh!

876
00:18:17,769 --> 00:18:18,602
- [Devan] Ooh!

877
00:18:18,602 --> 00:18:19,492
- [Both] Dude!

878
00:18:19,492 --> 00:18:20,557
- [Collins] Oh, let's dump it out.

879
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,544
Dude, this is so gross .

880
00:18:22,544 --> 00:18:23,377
Ooh! - Not the sides!

881
00:18:23,377 --> 00:18:24,703
- Just gonna top it off right there.

882
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:25,536
Oh no!

883
00:18:25,536 --> 00:18:26,632
- The stinky tofu made it's way

884
00:18:26,632 --> 00:18:28,190
through this whole smoothie.

885
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,171
- It's dripping!

886
00:18:29,171 --> 00:18:30,169
Time to spin the mystery wheels

887
00:18:30,169 --> 00:18:31,315
for which one we're gonna get.

888
00:18:31,315 --> 00:18:33,878
And I hope I get the good one!

889
00:18:33,878 --> 00:18:35,116
- Please be the good one.

890
00:18:35,116 --> 00:18:35,949
- Three ...

891
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:37,115
- [Both] Two, one!

892
00:18:37,115 --> 00:18:37,948
(wheels clacking)

893
00:18:37,948 --> 00:18:38,781
- Please be the good one. - Please!

894
00:18:38,781 --> 00:18:40,101
Please, please, please.

895
00:18:40,101 --> 00:18:41,451
- I'm not gonna look at mine until you read off yours.

896
00:18:41,451 --> 00:18:42,284
So go for it.

897
00:18:42,284 --> 00:18:43,117
- Alright.

898
00:18:43,117 --> 00:18:43,950
No!

899
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:44,783
(both yelling)

900
00:18:44,783 --> 00:18:46,210
It says worst smoothie!

901
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,665
- Dude, I'm so sorry, bro!

902
00:18:47,665 --> 00:18:48,550
- No!

903
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:49,383
- Three ...

904
00:18:49,383 --> 00:18:50,216
Oh no, two ...

905
00:18:50,216 --> 00:18:51,049
One.

906
00:18:51,049 --> 00:18:51,882
(triumphant music)

907
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:52,715
Yeah! - No!

908
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:53,852
- Dude, I got the good smoothie!

909
00:18:53,852 --> 00:18:55,066
Oh yeah! - No!

910
00:18:55,066 --> 00:18:56,380
- I'm actually so sorry for you though.

911
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,060
'Cause that's like, the worst smoothie challenge

912
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,250
we've ever done, bro.

913
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,253
Alright, well let's see how

914
00:19:00,253 --> 00:19:01,219
the best reviewed smoothie tastes.

915
00:19:01,219 --> 00:19:02,566
So here we go.

916
00:19:02,566 --> 00:19:03,587
- How is it?

917
00:19:03,587 --> 00:19:04,661
- Mm!

918
00:19:04,661 --> 00:19:05,494
- Wow.

919
00:19:05,494 --> 00:19:06,327
Yeah, yeah.

920
00:19:06,327 --> 00:19:07,160
Uh-huh.

921
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,073
Way to rub it in, bro.

922
00:19:08,073 --> 00:19:10,819
- That is the best smoothie I have ever had!

923
00:19:10,819 --> 00:19:13,445
But Devan, time for you to take a drink of yours, bro.

924
00:19:13,445 --> 00:19:14,339
- Alright, here we go.
