1
00:00:00,157 --> 00:00:02,740
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:20,988 --> 00:00:24,180
- So are we like, sure this is the right place?

3
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,455
- I think so, 'cause like basically

4
00:00:26,455 --> 00:00:28,568
everyone figured out that, in the first keyhole

5
00:00:28,568 --> 00:00:30,576
you could see these different wrestling ropes.

6
00:00:30,576 --> 00:00:32,085
And then from there, there was a

7
00:00:32,085 --> 00:00:33,623
profile tag that brought them to

8
00:00:33,623 --> 00:00:34,818
another profile, and then that one

9
00:00:34,818 --> 00:00:37,018
was a whole bunch of different luchador masks.

10
00:00:37,018 --> 00:00:38,759
And then from that profile there

11
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:40,280
was another hidden tag, and then

12
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,530
it brought them to this pic right here.

13
00:00:44,737 --> 00:00:48,940
Basically, it's a lucha libre fight in Boyle Heights.

14
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,440
- It's okay, I'll protect you.

15
00:00:52,956 --> 00:00:54,622
- Just in case anything happens, this

16
00:00:54,622 --> 00:00:57,289
is my location, avenge my death!

17
00:00:58,934 --> 00:00:59,767
- You'll be fine.

18
00:00:59,767 --> 00:01:02,184
(laughs)

19
00:01:02,184 --> 00:01:04,576
- That's a good one!

20
00:01:04,576 --> 00:01:08,273
- It's after five Collins, boundaries, remember?

21
00:01:08,273 --> 00:01:09,375
- No, I don't know, no I should.

22
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:10,208
- No, you shouldn't.

23
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:11,883
- No we should walk.

24
00:01:11,883 --> 00:01:13,310
- Thank you.

25
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:14,143
Bye.

26
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:20,559
- Door number one, I think that's an Instagram account.

27
00:01:20,559 --> 00:01:22,393
- It smells like pee.

28
00:01:22,393 --> 00:01:25,028
- You guys, it's a video!

29
00:01:25,028 --> 00:01:26,171
She's probably in here, come on!

30
00:01:26,171 --> 00:01:27,004
- I don't think, okay dude.

31
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:28,109
- Come on she's probably in here, come on!

32
00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:31,609
- Alright, Jacob, don't leave me, come on!

33
00:01:35,376 --> 00:01:37,626
(cheering)

34
00:01:39,004 --> 00:01:41,421
Is this what you had in mind?

35
00:01:43,751 --> 00:01:46,751
(heavy metal music)

36
00:02:00,235 --> 00:02:03,090
- [Mystery Girl] I used to fight with myself.

37
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,090
Do this, say that, be this person, not that one.

38
00:02:08,737 --> 00:02:11,721
I was putting on a show, a spectacle.

39
00:02:11,721 --> 00:02:14,681
Fighting to hide who I really was.

40
00:02:14,681 --> 00:02:17,764
But, in a fight, someone has to lose.

41
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:24,106
And when you're fighting yourself, it's always gonna be you.

42
00:02:25,843 --> 00:02:28,935
So I stopped fighting and started living.

43
00:02:28,935 --> 00:02:31,352
You should too, come find me!

44
00:02:33,573 --> 00:02:35,981
You're getting closer!

45
00:02:35,981 --> 00:02:38,064
(groans)

46
00:02:42,337 --> 00:02:46,812
(yells in foreign language)

47
00:02:46,812 --> 00:02:48,222
- What is he saying?

48
00:02:48,222 --> 00:02:52,970
- Light version, I don't think he likes you on your phone.

49
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:54,810
(shocked yelling)

50
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:58,643
- I'm sorry, wait, wait, wait, check this out!

51
00:02:59,998 --> 00:03:02,915
(astonished gasps)

52
00:03:05,245 --> 00:03:07,912
(loud cheering)

53
00:03:21,218 --> 00:03:24,135
(upbeat pop music)

54
00:03:56,346 --> 00:03:57,185
- Oh my god, let's leave!

55
00:03:57,185 --> 00:03:58,247
- What happened?

56
00:03:58,247 --> 00:04:02,014
- I just hit on a wrestler in front of his wife!

57
00:04:02,014 --> 00:04:02,847
(laughs)

58
00:04:02,847 --> 00:04:03,929
- [Collins] Oh my gosh!

59
00:04:03,929 --> 00:04:06,689
- If you guys need me, I will be in the bathroom,

60
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:08,436
drowning myself in the toilet, okay?

61
00:04:08,436 --> 00:04:09,840
- [Carla] Okay.

62
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,935
- So, please, move!

63
00:04:11,935 --> 00:04:13,723
- Should we go now?

64
00:04:13,723 --> 00:04:14,930
- No, let's give him a minute.

65
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,521
- Alright.

66
00:04:16,521 --> 00:04:19,771
In the meantime, may I have this dance?

67
00:04:24,251 --> 00:04:25,084
- Dude.

68
00:04:27,281 --> 00:04:28,114
Okay.

69
00:04:35,523 --> 00:04:38,523
(soft upbeat music)

70
00:04:51,867 --> 00:04:53,867
(beep)
