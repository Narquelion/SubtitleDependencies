1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,660
- You challenged us to try a whole bunch

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:02,550
of crazy school hacks.

3
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:04,310
One of them is a giant edible glue stick.

4
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:05,860
The winner gets $10,000.

5
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:07,470
So right now, let's go. - Oh yeah.

6
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,730
- You challenged us to do the ultimate egg drop test,

7
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:10,970
but we're using ostrich eggs.

8
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:11,803
These things are massive,

9
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:12,690
so right now let's figure out

10
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:13,680
how we protect these eggs.

11
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,060
I'm using a giant squishie

12
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,220
as the first layer of protection

13
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:17,270
for my egg right here.

14
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:18,500
- [Devan] I thought I'd use a watermelon

15
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,440
as like an extra layer of protection.

16
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,810
- Now it's time to take a look at the inside, here we go.

17
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,310
- [Both] Three, two, one.

18
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,800
- It melts so perfectly. - That's so satisfying

19
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,940
- [Collins] Dude, if you add too many rubber bands

20
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,170
you'll make the watermelon blow up.

21
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,003
- [Devan] Nope, don't think so.

22
00:00:29,003 --> 00:00:29,850
- So here we go, gonna take the egg,

23
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:31,260
gonna see if it fits.

24
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,093
Yes!

25
00:00:32,093 --> 00:00:32,926
Like a glove.

26
00:00:32,926 --> 00:00:33,759
- Like a glove.

27
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:34,592
- All right so here we go.

28
00:00:34,592 --> 00:00:36,213
(watermelon popping) (both screaming)

29
00:00:36,213 --> 00:00:38,570
- What just happened?

30
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:41,083
- I told that was what's gonna happen!

31
00:00:43,589 --> 00:00:44,507
(watermelon popping) (slow motion screaming)

32
00:00:44,507 --> 00:00:45,340
- Dude!

33
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,330
- It's like dripping bro!

34
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:47,490
I warned you Devan.

35
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:48,750
Now it's time to turn this thing over.

36
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,500
And I'm gonna be coating this in gallium,

37
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,830
which is liquid metal, it's gonna add a metal coating to it.

38
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:54,060
Alright, time to put on the safety glasses.

39
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,310
Do not try this at home!

40
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:56,143
Three,

41
00:00:56,143 --> 00:00:57,660
- [Both] Two, one.

42
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,571
Ohh!

43
00:00:58,571 --> 00:00:59,854
- [Collins] You can hear it sizzling!

44
00:00:59,854 --> 00:01:00,687
- [Devan] What?

45
00:01:00,687 --> 00:01:01,520
- [Collins] This looks nuts!

46
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,497
- [Devan] That's insane.

47
00:01:02,497 --> 00:01:04,180
- [Collins] Let's listen to it, man.

48
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,480
- [Devan] It's like a chromed-out Mario.

49
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,270
- I think it's gonna add a really nice protective layer

50
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:09,103
to my squishie.

51
00:01:09,103 --> 00:01:10,900
- [Devan] So for this next step I'm gonna be using oobleck.

52
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,683
- [Collin] Oh that's, hey, nah, nah, nah, not in my gallium!

53
00:01:12,683 --> 00:01:13,787
- I am so sorry!

54
00:01:13,787 --> 00:01:14,620
- Yo, dude!

55
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,453
- Wait, what?

56
00:01:15,453 --> 00:01:16,286
- [Collins] This split my pan!

57
00:01:16,286 --> 00:01:17,575
- Whoa, put it down, put it down, put it down, put it down!

58
00:01:17,575 --> 00:01:18,570
- [Collins} No, but dude look at that man!

59
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,650
That is absolutely insane, bro!

60
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:21,483
- That is not good!

61
00:01:21,483 --> 00:01:22,840
- The heat must've like, cracked it open.

62
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,976
- [Devan] Oh, yeah.

63
00:01:23,976 --> 00:01:25,110
I can feel it turning into oobleck already.

64
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:25,950
- Got my metal squishie,

65
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,593
and now it's time to put an instant glue shell around it.

66
00:01:27,593 --> 00:01:30,190
- [Devan] All right, so I gotta add my chia seeds next,

67
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,023
so I'm gonna add these.

68
00:01:31,023 --> 00:01:32,840
- Devan, this about to smell real bad,

69
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,186
so we're gonna pop these masks on.

70
00:01:34,186 --> 00:01:35,503
All right, here we go, stay still Devan here we go.

71
00:01:35,503 --> 00:01:37,150
Just gonna pop this on, just like this.

72
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:38,340
I'm sorry I'm trying to figure this out.

73
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,570
- You're kind of yelling in my ear though.

74
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:40,403
- All right, there we go, boom!

75
00:01:40,403 --> 00:01:41,236
All right, yours is on.

76
00:01:41,236 --> 00:01:42,588
- Yep, that's really tight and secure.

77
00:01:42,588 --> 00:01:43,421
- [Collins] All right, here we go.

78
00:01:43,421 --> 00:01:44,567
Three, two, one!

79
00:01:45,577 --> 00:01:47,074
- [Both] Ooooh!

80
00:01:47,074 --> 00:01:48,707
- [Devan] Look at that!

81
00:01:48,707 --> 00:01:49,794
No way!

82
00:01:49,794 --> 00:01:51,803
- [Collins] What on earth?

83
00:01:51,803 --> 00:01:53,001
- [Devan] This is insane!

84
00:01:53,001 --> 00:01:53,930
- [Collins] This is nuts!

85
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:55,240
- [Devan] This is crazy!

86
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,841
- [Collins] That's awesome!

87
00:01:56,841 --> 00:01:58,650
(Collins cheers)

88
00:01:58,650 --> 00:01:59,930
I'm making some indestructible slime,

89
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:00,763
we're starting off with

90
00:02:00,763 --> 00:02:02,410
the indestructible shaving cream mound.

91
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:04,379
- What are you doing, making a shaving cream fortress?

92
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:05,860
- [Collins] Yes, exactly Devan.

93
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,680
I'm making slime in a brand new way.

94
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,260
- [Devan] I'm lining the inside of my melon with cement.

95
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,370
- Next up we're gonna add some Sta-Flo,

96
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,460
and I really hope that the shaving cream's

97
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,293
gonna stop this stuff.

98
00:02:13,293 --> 00:02:14,634
- What exactly are you trying to do?

99
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,043
- [Collins] I'm trying to make some slime, Devan.

100
00:02:16,043 --> 00:02:17,060
So here we go, just gonna mix it all in like this.

101
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,140
I really hope it starts coming together.

102
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:18,973
Uh oh, Sta-Flo.

103
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:20,405
No, oh, oh.

104
00:02:20,405 --> 00:02:21,640
(both yelling)

105
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,540
- Sta-Flo, stop!

106
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,590
- Stop-Flo.

107
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,130
- [Devan] This is really messy.

108
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:26,530
- [Collins] Yo, look at this!

109
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,000
Whoa!

110
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,699
- [Devan] Dude, I gotta set it down.

111
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:30,532
- [Collins] It got red so fast!

112
00:02:30,532 --> 00:02:31,365
Dude, oh my gosh!

113
00:02:31,365 --> 00:02:32,840
- [Devan] All right the concrete watermelons are done,

114
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,579
now it's time to make a nest.

115
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:36,746
(Collins screams)

116
00:02:36,746 --> 00:02:37,579
And you're surprised by this?

117
00:02:37,579 --> 00:02:39,040
- [Collins] I'm just trying to do my best!

118
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,623
I've learned from my mistakes!

119
00:02:41,777 --> 00:02:42,930
Oh my gosh and now I've got a bucket of slime.

120
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,059
- Hold on, 'cause this next part takes

121
00:02:44,059 --> 00:02:44,892
a lot of concentration.

122
00:02:44,892 --> 00:02:46,040
I need you to contain yourself.

123
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,840
All right, so you take the ice mold just like this,

124
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,308
and you wanna just go across very quickly like this.

125
00:02:50,308 --> 00:02:52,042
- [Collins] Oh my gosh!

126
00:02:52,042 --> 00:02:53,233
Next up we're gonna get some Orbeez in here,

127
00:02:53,233 --> 00:02:54,066
so let's see, we're just gonna pick up a whole bunch

128
00:02:54,066 --> 00:02:54,899
of Orbeez like this.

129
00:02:54,899 --> 00:02:55,732
And then just, uh, sprinkle them in like that.

130
00:02:55,732 --> 00:02:56,692
- All right so I spun a couple more webs.

131
00:02:56,692 --> 00:02:58,491
What?

132
00:02:58,491 --> 00:02:59,324
What?

133
00:02:59,324 --> 00:03:00,324
- I'm sorry?

134
00:03:01,274 --> 00:03:02,279
- [Devan] And I made a pretty nice nest.

135
00:03:02,279 --> 00:03:03,874
- [Collins] Yeah, that nest looks really good actually.

136
00:03:03,874 --> 00:03:04,707
- [Devan] Yeah, it really does.

137
00:03:04,707 --> 00:03:05,540
- [Collins] Now as you do that, it's time for me to

138
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,373
lift out my egg here and coat this thing in slime.

139
00:03:06,373 --> 00:03:08,065
(Collins yells)

140
00:03:08,065 --> 00:03:08,982
It's soggy!

141
00:03:11,016 --> 00:03:11,849
So here we go we're gonna put it in like this.

142
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:12,682
And then we're just gonna kinda like cover it from the front

143
00:03:12,682 --> 00:03:14,775
so everyone say goodbye to my very well protected egg.

144
00:03:14,775 --> 00:03:18,180
Let is just fall down and perfectly coat my egg,

145
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,040
just like this.

146
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:19,873
What're you, what is that?

147
00:03:19,873 --> 00:03:21,141
- [Devan] I'm using Flex Tape.

148
00:03:21,141 --> 00:03:22,290
- It's time to seal it in a bag.

149
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:23,123
- Why?

150
00:03:23,123 --> 00:03:23,956
- You'll see.

151
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:27,987
Here we go, we're gonna lift this up,

152
00:03:27,987 --> 00:03:29,870
and on the count of three we're gonna drop it in.

153
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:30,703
You ready?

154
00:03:30,703 --> 00:03:31,536
Three, two, one.

155
00:03:31,536 --> 00:03:32,369
Devan!

156
00:03:32,369 --> 00:03:33,202
- I got you!

157
00:03:33,202 --> 00:03:34,035
- I can feel it cracking!

158
00:03:34,035 --> 00:03:34,868
You're breaking the structure of it!

159
00:03:34,868 --> 00:03:35,701
- I got you, I got you.

160
00:03:35,701 --> 00:03:36,534
- No you are not!

161
00:03:36,534 --> 00:03:37,367
- You're overflowing!

162
00:03:37,367 --> 00:03:38,200
- That's because you didn't hold it right!

163
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,033
- Why are you overflowing?

164
00:03:39,033 --> 00:03:39,866
- You did this to yourself.

165
00:03:39,866 --> 00:03:40,699
- What do you mean?

166
00:03:40,699 --> 00:03:41,532
- And to me!

167
00:03:41,532 --> 00:03:42,540
- [Devan] I need more Flex Tape bro.

168
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,177
- I need more help!

169
00:03:44,177 --> 00:03:45,010
Help me!

170
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,625
So here we go, just gonna put the pump on here.

171
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:47,458
(Devan grunts)

172
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:48,291
(Collin mumbles)

173
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:49,490
Oh, dude, it's working!

174
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:50,700
- [Devan] That looks terrible!

175
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,050
Yeah, that looks pretty funky, man.

176
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,600
I gotta say, I don't think it's your, uh,

177
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,230
not your most pleasing work, I'll give you that.

178
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:57,440
Here we go, screw this on, and, all right.

179
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,380
I got a few finishing touches to add to mine,

180
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,540
and then it's time to find out if this can

181
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,040
really protect my egg and win the $10,000.

182
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,550
These things turned out crazy, man!

183
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:05,754
Like yours, very interesting.

184
00:04:05,754 --> 00:04:08,799
Yeah, there's a lotta elements on it, mine though,

185
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:09,632
I think definitely has a big chance to win this,

186
00:04:09,632 --> 00:04:10,530
so here's the big reveal.

187
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,320
- [Both] Three, two, one!

188
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,210
Tada!

189
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:14,674
- [Collins] Man!

190
00:04:14,674 --> 00:04:16,283
What is that, bro?

191
00:04:16,283 --> 00:04:17,643
- [Devan] How the tables have turned.

192
00:04:17,643 --> 00:04:18,661
- [Collins] I know.

193
00:04:18,661 --> 00:04:19,504
You get to comment down below,

194
00:04:19,504 --> 00:04:20,521
whose egg do you think will survive the drop.

195
00:04:20,521 --> 00:04:21,354
We'll be testing it and finding out the winner

196
00:04:21,354 --> 00:04:22,760
of the $10,000 at the end of the video.

197
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,593
You challenged us to do the ultimate art challenge,

198
00:04:23,593 --> 00:04:26,437
but with a whole bunch of school hacks, so let's go.

199
00:04:26,437 --> 00:04:29,337
For my art piece, I'm making an insane item from Fortnite.

200
00:04:31,075 --> 00:04:33,166
- [Devan] And for mine I'm making an Angry Birds mosaic.

201
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:36,097
- [Collins] I'm using acetone to melt

202
00:04:36,097 --> 00:04:37,073
a whole bunch of styrofoam in a very sticky paste.

203
00:04:37,073 --> 00:04:37,906
- [Devan] And I'm using liquid nitrogen

204
00:04:37,906 --> 00:04:38,750
to freeze some rubber duckies, and then explode them.

205
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,583
(both screaming)

206
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:40,520
- What on earth?

207
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,539
I'm almost scared right now.

208
00:04:41,539 --> 00:04:42,380
- [Devan] This hasn't happened before.

209
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,213
- [Collins] Let's do this, here we go,

210
00:04:43,213 --> 00:04:44,361
we're gonna dump the whole bucket into mine.

211
00:04:44,361 --> 00:04:45,690
We'll melt this down from the top as well.

212
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:46,523
Here we go.

213
00:04:46,523 --> 00:04:47,757
Boom, like that, check it out.

214
00:04:47,757 --> 00:04:48,918
- [Devan] Whoa.

215
00:04:48,918 --> 00:04:49,751
All right now it's time to dump 'em all.

216
00:04:49,751 --> 00:04:50,810
- [Collins] Do not try this at home!

217
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:52,433
- [Both] Three, two, one!

218
00:04:53,565 --> 00:04:54,398
(both yelling)

219
00:04:54,398 --> 00:04:56,220
- That is the worst rubber ducky bath I have ever seen!

220
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,060
(both screaming)

221
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,760
- [Collins] Holy cow!

222
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,593
They're popping off!

223
00:04:59,593 --> 00:05:00,461
What is going on?

224
00:05:00,461 --> 00:05:01,810
- [Devan] They're like fireworks on Fourth of July!

225
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:02,841
I've never seen this before, man!

226
00:05:02,841 --> 00:05:05,542
(both screaming)

227
00:05:05,542 --> 00:05:07,220
The goo is starting to come together,

228
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,000
so right now I'm gonna use a styrofoam cup to add even more.

229
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,833
I'm gonna use a styrofoam cup to add even more.

230
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:10,666
and check this out.

231
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:11,499
- Look at that.

232
00:05:11,499 --> 00:05:12,332
- What?

233
00:05:12,332 --> 00:05:13,899
- You gonna see it like decomposing,

234
00:05:13,899 --> 00:05:14,732
and deconstructing right in front of your eyes, man.

235
00:05:14,732 --> 00:05:17,110
it can deconstruct in front of your eyes, man.

236
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:17,943
Now the moment of truth,

237
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:20,030
time to see if the goo is actually working, so here we go.

238
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:21,294
- [Both] Yo!

239
00:05:21,294 --> 00:05:22,127
- [Collins] Look at that!

240
00:05:22,127 --> 00:05:23,160
- Now it's time to smash these things up.

241
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,420
- Dude if they were already like, popping off and bursting,

242
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,807
what's gonna happen when you smash it?

243
00:05:26,807 --> 00:05:28,550
Yo, the goo is all done!

244
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,140
This stuff is wild!

245
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,640
- All right just gonna scoop a couple out.

246
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,543
Just like this.

247
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,394
- [Both] Three, two, one.

248
00:05:36,394 --> 00:05:37,227
(hammer pounding) (duck squeaking)

249
00:05:37,227 --> 00:05:38,060
- [Both] Oh!

250
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:38,893
Oh!

251
00:05:38,893 --> 00:05:39,954
- [Collins] I heard the squeak!

252
00:05:39,954 --> 00:05:42,914
(rubber ducks squeaking)

253
00:05:42,914 --> 00:05:44,572
- All right, yo, listen to them.

254
00:05:44,572 --> 00:05:45,480
- [Collins] All right, yo, listen to them.

255
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,738
- [Devan] Why are they squeaking?

256
00:05:46,738 --> 00:05:47,978
that's what duckies do Devan.

257
00:05:47,978 --> 00:05:48,811
it's what they do.

258
00:05:48,811 --> 00:05:49,790
- I know but they're frozen.

259
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:50,790
All right, go for another one.

260
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,000
- Here we go.

261
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,984
I'm sorry guys!

262
00:05:52,984 --> 00:05:55,275
(hammer pounding) (glass shattering)

263
00:05:55,275 --> 00:05:56,607
(screaming)

264
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,871
(glass shattering)

265
00:05:57,871 --> 00:06:00,380
(glass shattering sound plays)

266
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,920
Wait a minute!

267
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,860
Wait a minute!

268
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,510
I have no idea what this has to do with art,

269
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,622
but I really hope it's gonna help you make a great piece.

270
00:06:06,622 --> 00:06:07,455
- Oh you'll see.

271
00:06:09,604 --> 00:06:11,006
Next up I have a life hack with this iron and pastel.

272
00:06:11,006 --> 00:06:12,275
- While you do that I've got a roller blade here,

273
00:06:12,275 --> 00:06:13,108
this is uh, not mine.

274
00:06:13,108 --> 00:06:13,941
Uh oh, oh, oh, oh.

275
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:14,774
Okay, bigger chunks coming down.

276
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:15,607
- All right, I've got the sketch out

277
00:06:15,607 --> 00:06:16,440
outta my mosaic right here.

278
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,273
- Yo, that looks awesome.

279
00:06:17,273 --> 00:06:18,290
- [Devan] Just gonna place it down like this.

280
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:19,630
- [Both] Oh!

281
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,463
- [Devan] Yes!

282
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:21,420
- [Collins] Dude, that is awesome.

283
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,470
- This would've taken so long without this.

284
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:24,650
- [Collins] All right, well the rollerskate is done,

285
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,800
again this is gonna act as the base of my Fortnite item.

286
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,730
- [Devan] Next up I'm making squishy paint for my pigs.

287
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:30,680
- [Collins] I am making a crazy unicorn horn.

288
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,923
- [Both] Ready, set, go!

289
00:06:31,923 --> 00:06:33,170
- [Collins] Just gonna use some support here,

290
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:34,003
gotta be very careful with it.

291
00:06:34,003 --> 00:06:35,800
- [Devan] I have no clue what's about to happen.

292
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,020
Whoa!

293
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:37,853
- [Collins] It's working dude!

294
00:06:37,853 --> 00:06:38,970
I gotta stay so still right now.

295
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:41,160
- [Devan] It's like the instant water, dude.

296
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,353
- [Collins] Holy cow!

297
00:06:44,497 --> 00:06:45,438
It's building up, bro!

298
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:46,360
- [Devan] It's like you're making a candle from scratch.

299
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,573
- [Collins] It's turning into a real unicorn horn, bro!

300
00:06:48,573 --> 00:06:50,380
This literally looks like magic right now.

301
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,336
There you have it!

302
00:06:52,336 --> 00:06:53,407
A literal unicorn horn made with actual magic.

303
00:06:53,407 --> 00:06:54,771
(jazzy music)

304
00:06:54,771 --> 00:06:57,480
(jazzy music plays)

305
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,640
- [Collins] Well as you do that,

306
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,473
I've got a whole bunch of Styrofoam here,

307
00:06:59,473 --> 00:07:01,390
and it's time for me to carve out the main piece of my art,

308
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,275
Devan, yeah.

309
00:07:02,275 --> 00:07:03,108
- Are you distracted at all?

310
00:07:03,108 --> 00:07:03,941
- Yeah, if you could stop doing that

311
00:07:03,941 --> 00:07:04,774
in the background that'll be nice.

312
00:07:04,774 --> 00:07:06,245
- [Both] Three, two, one.

313
00:07:06,245 --> 00:07:07,761
Whoa!

314
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:08,594
- [Collins] Oh, snap.

315
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:09,976
Boom, art, there we go.

316
00:07:09,976 --> 00:07:11,470
- [Devan] Time for bowl number three.

317
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:12,837
Okay I got it, I got it, I got it.

318
00:07:12,837 --> 00:07:13,670
Put bowl number one off to the side.

319
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:14,503
- I mean, that pretty much worked.

320
00:07:14,503 --> 00:07:15,336
- [Devan] All right,

321
00:07:15,336 --> 00:07:16,852
now it's finally time to mix up the colors.

322
00:07:16,852 --> 00:07:17,919
- I wanna see if I can remove this piece right here.

323
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,419
Here we go, three, two, one.

324
00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:20,252
Oh!

325
00:07:20,252 --> 00:07:21,085
- Whoa!

326
00:07:21,085 --> 00:07:21,918
- Dude, it's starting to come together, man!

327
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:22,751
- Whoa!

328
00:07:22,751 --> 00:07:23,584
You're super good with that tool.

329
00:07:23,584 --> 00:07:24,417
- Thank you man, yeah, I've found my true art passion.

330
00:07:24,417 --> 00:07:26,540
- All right I've got my place mat cleared,

331
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,550
just gonna, kinda, just gonna pop that in right over here.

332
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,810
- I am out of room!

333
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:32,580
I got some clay here to fill out the head.

334
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,220
- [Devan] Now I got a couple more colors to fill in.

335
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,410
- [Collins] To extract the color from a crayon,

336
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:36,790
we're gonna do it in a very unique way.

337
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,440
We're gonna use a hair straightener right here,

338
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,040
or curler, I dunno, this does something to your hair.

339
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,295
So here we go, we're just gonna melt a crayon

340
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:42,356
on and drip it on to the little sponge.

341
00:07:42,356 --> 00:07:43,433
Oh, man, look at that, it just melts down, so here we go.

342
00:07:43,433 --> 00:07:45,949
- [Devan] First step for me though, is laying down the glue.

343
00:07:45,949 --> 00:07:49,853
- [Collins] Dude, it melts so quickly on this thing, man.

344
00:07:49,853 --> 00:07:51,810
You can just line the whole thing like this.

345
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:52,780
I've got the melted crayons,

346
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,290
so right now time to do a little swipe on here.

347
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:56,036
You ready, here we go.

348
00:07:56,036 --> 00:07:56,870
- [Both] Three, two, one.

349
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:57,703
Oh!

350
00:07:57,703 --> 00:07:59,050
- Wait, wait, where are you doing that?

351
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,040
- I'm swiping it right here, man.

352
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,907
There we go, a rainbow, Devan.

353
00:08:00,907 --> 00:08:02,850
Isn't it clear, it's a rainbow?

354
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,363
- Yeah.

355
00:08:04,363 --> 00:08:06,357
This is my electric lawn applicator.

356
00:08:06,357 --> 00:08:07,420
So I'm gonna pour some of this lawn into here.

357
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,198
There's an electrical current that runs through this.

358
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,158
You can think of this nail as a lightning pole,

359
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:11,991
What?

360
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:12,824
(thunder booming)

361
00:08:12,824 --> 00:08:13,657
What?

362
00:08:13,657 --> 00:08:14,960
- I thought like, lightning was gonna strike us.

363
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,165
- No no no.

364
00:08:16,165 --> 00:08:17,993
It conducts the electricity through the glue here.

365
00:08:18,961 --> 00:08:20,291
I just have to, kinda shake it around.

366
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,124
- [Collins] So you're just like adding grass to it.

367
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,319
- Now it's time to create the electrical reaction.

368
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:24,152
- I don't know what to do with my hands, man,

369
00:08:24,152 --> 00:08:25,187
I'm kinda scared.

370
00:08:25,187 --> 00:08:26,020
Are you sure this isn't gonna create like,

371
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:26,853
electricity everywhere or anything?

372
00:08:26,853 --> 00:08:27,686
- No, I'm not.

373
00:08:27,686 --> 00:08:29,720
- [Both] Three, two, one.

374
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,516
Oh!

375
00:08:31,516 --> 00:08:32,349
- [Devan] Man!

376
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:33,791
- [Collins] Whoa, look at that!

377
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,840
- [Devan] It's like hopping around!

378
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,854
- [Collins] Dude, I know, the little piece are like

379
00:08:36,854 --> 00:08:37,687
jumping all up in the air.

380
00:08:37,687 --> 00:08:38,850
It's like an alien attack, man, it's like a

381
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,960
spaceship just dragging up a whole bunch of the grass.

382
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,840
Right now it's time for us to put

383
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,390
the finishing touches on our art piece.

384
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,474
The art pieces are done,

385
00:08:44,474 --> 00:08:47,160
and these things look absolutely crazy,

386
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,494
so here is the big reveal.

387
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:49,327
absolutely crazy, so here is the big reveal.

388
00:08:49,327 --> 00:08:50,160
- [Both] Three, two, one.

389
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:50,993
Tada!

390
00:08:50,993 --> 00:08:52,280
- [Collins] Look at this thing, man!

391
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,433
And look at that!

392
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:54,266
- [Devan] These are crazy!

393
00:08:54,266 --> 00:08:55,541
- [Collins] Yeah, so you get to

394
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:56,680
comment down below whose art piece is better,

395
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,370
we'll be choosing the $10,000 winner

396
00:08:58,370 --> 00:08:59,330
at the end of the video.

397
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,951
You challenged us to make the ultimate school lunch hack,

398
00:09:00,951 --> 00:09:02,820
with macaroni and cheese and pizza.

399
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,050
The winner gets $10,000 so let's go.

400
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm kicking it off with the cheese for my pizza.

401
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,062
So here we're just gonna suck it up like this.

402
00:09:09,062 --> 00:09:10,310
- [Devan] And I'm making the cheese for my mac and cheese.

403
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:11,840
I'm turning it into a cheese powder.

404
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,957
- [Collins] Whoa, dude, look at it, it's like,

405
00:09:13,957 --> 00:09:15,684
it's kinda like undulating on here, man.

406
00:09:15,684 --> 00:09:16,517
Yo, this is insane!

407
00:09:16,517 --> 00:09:17,444
Dude, you're not doing it right.

408
00:09:17,444 --> 00:09:18,574
This, is how you do it.

409
00:09:18,574 --> 00:09:19,407
You just go like this.

410
00:09:19,407 --> 00:09:20,397
See, look at that.

411
00:09:20,397 --> 00:09:21,474
You wanna powder rise in midair.

412
00:09:21,474 --> 00:09:22,307
That's how you do it, Devan.

413
00:09:22,307 --> 00:09:23,285
Yo, wait a minute dude, look at this.

414
00:09:23,285 --> 00:09:24,985
My cheese is coming together.

415
00:09:24,985 --> 00:09:27,443
From the front it looks like delicious cheese,

416
00:09:28,426 --> 00:09:29,480
but from the back, it looks like a frosty paradise.

417
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,313
For layer number two,

418
00:09:30,313 --> 00:09:31,580
we're gonna be using this thing over here.

419
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,933
So let's just, ah, whoa.

420
00:09:34,564 --> 00:09:35,397
So let's see, we're just gonna pour some of this in,

421
00:09:35,397 --> 00:09:36,535
three, two, one.

422
00:09:36,535 --> 00:09:37,368
Ohh!

423
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,850
- [Devan] It looks like a shower of cheese.

424
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,328
- Oh, could you imagine?

425
00:09:40,328 --> 00:09:43,280
A world with a shower of cheese.

426
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,200
Eh, eh, it's dripping, it's dripping, it's dripping.

427
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,510
No no no, no no no, no no no!

428
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,343
Suck it up!

429
00:09:47,343 --> 00:09:48,443
Suck it up, and shoot it out!

430
00:09:48,443 --> 00:09:50,090
Suck it up, and oh, my gosh.

431
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,000
- [Devan] All right, goldfish are done,

432
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,350
now I'm gonna add it to this bowl.

433
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,067
So I think it'd be super cool to spray my cheese

434
00:09:54,067 --> 00:09:55,230
onto my noodles.

435
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,714
I'm gonna use some water to test it out.

436
00:09:56,714 --> 00:09:58,345
Three, two, one.

437
00:09:58,345 --> 00:09:59,632
- Do it on my dry ice to see if it works.

438
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:00,760
(both cheering)

439
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,130
- That, it totally works!

440
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:04,260
- Dev, that's water, that is water, that is water.

441
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,980
- I feel like this is like my broom-broom machine.

442
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,213
- You're gonna soak our whole room.

443
00:10:07,213 --> 00:10:08,650
- [Devan] It's like when you're in space

444
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,752
and you need to get propelled and you're like.

445
00:10:10,752 --> 00:10:11,585
(Devan makes spraying sounds)

446
00:10:11,585 --> 00:10:12,418
- A broom-broom machine?

447
00:10:12,418 --> 00:10:13,284
I can see the astronauts be like.

448
00:10:13,284 --> 00:10:14,700
This is uh, Houston Roger,

449
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,470
I can't find my broom-broom machine.

450
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,930
- Oh Houston, it's right here.

451
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:19,780
- Gonna place this right over here,

452
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,070
hopefully it does not melt.

453
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:22,410
And next up, we've got my quesadilla.

454
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:24,190
I mean, pizza crust.

455
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,310
- Wait, that's a paper towel, Collins.

456
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:26,230
- I forgot what I'm doing.

457
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:27,860
Wait, you're actually filling it up with cheese?

458
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,180
- [Devan] Well yeah, it's gonna be the best way

459
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,250
to add it to my macaroni.

460
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,837
- [Collins] All right, here we go, just gonna use this

461
00:10:31,837 --> 00:10:33,253
right here to suck up some pasta juice like this,

462
00:10:33,253 --> 00:10:36,160
and then just kinda like sprinkle on the inside like that.

463
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,810
This is squeet pizza, here we go.

464
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:39,843
- Okay then.

465
00:10:39,843 --> 00:10:40,676
- Didn't think that through.

466
00:10:40,676 --> 00:10:41,730
- I got my cheese prepared,

467
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,919
and now it's time to spray it on my noodles.

468
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:45,630
All right, here we go.

469
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,463
- Three second Like Challenge.

470
00:10:46,463 --> 00:10:47,299
- Three second like challenge.

471
00:10:47,299 --> 00:10:48,520
We wanna see if you can like this video in three seconds.

472
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,371
You ready?

473
00:10:49,371 --> 00:10:50,204
Here we go.

474
00:10:50,204 --> 00:10:52,940
- [Both] Three, two, one, done.

475
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,877
Three, two, one, oh!

476
00:10:56,812 --> 00:10:57,777
- Absolutely blasting it, dude.

477
00:10:57,777 --> 00:10:58,970
- I'm gonna use this to protect me, man.

478
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:00,639
- [Devan] Dude, it's actually working, though.

479
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:01,472
- [Collins] It is?

480
00:11:01,472 --> 00:11:02,920
- [Devan] Now I'm making my next cheese filling,

481
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,860
but I'm gonna do it in a really rapid fashion.

482
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,090
I'm using sodium citrate to speed up the process.

483
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:08,270
- All right, I'm making my own relish

484
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,110
with some pickles here.

485
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,515
Dude, if you put your hand in here you get a pickle hand.

486
00:11:10,515 --> 00:11:14,390
Pickle hands, Devan, legitimate pickle hands!

487
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,223
Awww!

488
00:11:17,401 --> 00:11:18,940
- Ah, it's falling apart.

489
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,040
You really do love pickles, don't you.

490
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:20,936
- I love pickles.

491
00:11:20,936 --> 00:11:21,890
- [Devan] All right, you know this is done when

492
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,840
it turns into a slime consistency.

493
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,510
- [Collins] It looks like an alien carcass right here man,

494
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,850
Area 51 watch out,

495
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,197
this is what you're gonna find in it, man.

496
00:11:28,197 --> 00:11:30,680
- Dude, the cheese filling is done,

497
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,290
now it's time to make the ravioli.

498
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:33,123
All right, take this dough,

499
00:11:33,123 --> 00:11:34,629
put it over the top of the ice cube maker.

500
00:11:34,629 --> 00:11:35,462
- [Collins] All right here we go,

501
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:36,660
just gonna add a little bit of onions right here.

502
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,090
And last up we got some cornstarch.

503
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:39,102
Three, two, one, here we go.

504
00:11:39,102 --> 00:11:39,935
Okay, yeah!

505
00:11:39,935 --> 00:11:40,768
- Yeah.

506
00:11:40,768 --> 00:11:41,716
- Yeah!

507
00:11:41,716 --> 00:11:42,820
And there we go, okay yep.

508
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,870
And, done.

509
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,523
Okay, there we go, my relish is all finished up, and now,

510
00:11:46,523 --> 00:11:47,500
it's time to add it to my pizza.

511
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,860
That's right, I'm gonna have a relish stuffed pizza crust.

512
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,290
- [Devan] I've got the covering to my ravioli right here.

513
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,622
Just gonna lay it on top.

514
00:11:53,622 --> 00:11:54,455
- [Collins] All right, here we go,

515
00:11:54,455 --> 00:11:55,627
gonna take some relish here like this.

516
00:11:55,627 --> 00:11:56,473
Aw, man, dude, look at this.

517
00:11:56,473 --> 00:11:58,417
You know when the lunch lady asks what you want,

518
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:00,830
always say you want relish stuffed pizza crust

519
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:01,990
and she'll be very confused.

520
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,180
Next up we gotta skin these potatoes,

521
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,013
so I got the drill right here,

522
00:12:04,013 --> 00:12:06,887
but I realized, I've been going on mode one.

523
00:12:06,887 --> 00:12:08,065
There's actually a second more powerful mode.

524
00:12:08,065 --> 00:12:09,200
- Oh no.

525
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,400
You were not supposed to find that.

526
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,233
- Mode two!

527
00:12:11,233 --> 00:12:12,152
Three, two, one.

528
00:12:12,152 --> 00:12:12,985
- Why did you dump it in first?

529
00:12:12,985 --> 00:12:13,818
Oh, jeez.

530
00:12:13,818 --> 00:12:14,651
What is the point of this?

531
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:16,770
- To be honest, I um.

532
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,260
I thought a lot more would've happened.

533
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,854
Doesn't appear to have um, had any impact whatsoever.

534
00:12:19,854 --> 00:12:22,600
- Are you just trying to get everything messy dude?

535
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,434
- On my potatoes.

536
00:12:24,434 --> 00:12:25,267
Let's go for a little gentler approach.

537
00:12:25,267 --> 00:12:26,530
- [Devan] Dude, maybe turn it on one.

538
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:27,630
It's on two.

539
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,010
- It's gonna work, Devan.

540
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:31,830
Progress, there we go, you can see it's a little peeled.

541
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:33,360
I don't know if it was totally worth it.

542
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,229
- [Devan] Look at this!

543
00:12:34,229 --> 00:12:35,062
- [Collins] Dude!

544
00:12:35,062 --> 00:12:36,365
- [Devan] Look at this!

545
00:12:36,365 --> 00:12:37,696
(elevator music)

546
00:12:37,696 --> 00:12:39,634
- All right, done, the potatoes are actually peeled, dude,

547
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:40,857
look at this, man.

548
00:12:40,857 --> 00:12:42,960
- [Devan] For my next life hack I'm turning pizza sauce

549
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,060
into an edible glue stick.

550
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:44,893
- [Collins] Time for me to shred up

551
00:12:44,893 --> 00:12:45,872
some of my potatoes here,

552
00:12:45,872 --> 00:12:46,968
and this is gonna be a huge part of mine.

553
00:12:46,968 --> 00:12:48,240
- [Devan] For the rest of this life hack,

554
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,109
I just gotta pour this stuff into the straws.

555
00:12:50,109 --> 00:12:51,450
All right my straws are filled,

556
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:52,650
now it's time to pop 'em in the fridge.

557
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:54,100
- All right, I just gotta keep shredding my potatoes.

558
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,210
- [Devan] All right the glue sticks are back,

559
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,640
now it's time to take 'em out of the straws.

560
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,960
- [Both] Oh!

561
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,097
- That looks insane.

562
00:12:59,097 --> 00:12:59,930
- It's like a little worm!

563
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:00,763
All right, got the glue sticks out,

564
00:13:00,763 --> 00:13:01,890
now it's time to pop 'em in the freezer.

565
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:03,040
All right so while that's in the freezer,

566
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,050
I'm gonna roll out some dough.

567
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,733
- [Collins] Next up we're making a

568
00:13:05,733 --> 00:13:07,092
tater tot grilled cheese sandwich.

569
00:13:07,092 --> 00:13:08,117
It's a crazy life hack,

570
00:13:08,117 --> 00:13:08,950
but first we gotta slice up some cheese right here.

571
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,650
So here we go, just gonna use this butter knife right here.

572
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:12,600
- I've got something that's gonna be even cooler.

573
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,870
So I got the glue sticks out of the freezer.

574
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:15,703
And now, I'm gonna put them onto my pizza.

575
00:13:15,703 --> 00:13:17,084
- [Collins] That's not a glue stick though,

576
00:13:17,084 --> 00:13:18,647
that's pizza sauce, right?

577
00:13:18,647 --> 00:13:19,620
- [Devan] Yes.

578
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,453
- [Collins] Yo, this reminds me of like

579
00:13:20,453 --> 00:13:22,150
melted cheese and create a grilled cheese

580
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,920
without having to cook it at all, man.

581
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,970
- [Devan] Yeah, I wasn't really sure

582
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,570
this was gonna work, and it did.

583
00:13:27,417 --> 00:13:28,250
- All right I'm gonna make a panini here

584
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,083
with my tater tots and cheese.

585
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,600
So here we go, just gonna place some uh, some layers.

586
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,433
Oh my gosh.

587
00:13:31,433 --> 00:13:32,360
- [Devan] All right, last thing on my pizza

588
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,270
is some pepper slices.

589
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,103
- [Collins] All right, well as you're doing that,

590
00:13:34,103 --> 00:13:35,660
I gotta get my next layer of tots right here.

591
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,493
So here we go,

592
00:13:36,493 --> 00:13:38,990
just gonna layer these things like this on top't.

593
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,500
- [Devan] All right this pizza's ready to pop in the oven,

594
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,950
and now I'm gonna make a pasta bowl, out of pasta.

595
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:45,116
All right the first step is to grab this balloon here.

596
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:45,949
- [Collins] All right well as you do that,

597
00:13:45,949 --> 00:13:46,782
it's time for me to smash this thing down

598
00:13:46,782 --> 00:13:49,460
and turn it into an actual panini made out of tots.

599
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,070
Three, two, one.

600
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,100
- [Devan] You don't think that's too much?

601
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:52,933
- [Collins] No!

602
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:54,400
Here we go, just gonna smash it down like this.

603
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,022
We dislodged a couple pieces of cheese!

604
00:13:56,022 --> 00:13:56,855
- Oh!

605
00:13:56,855 --> 00:13:57,900
Dude!

606
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,733
- Well!

607
00:13:58,733 --> 00:13:59,640
- Do not try this at home!

608
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,689
- Do not try this at home.

609
00:14:00,689 --> 00:14:01,590
All right, let's give this another shot.

610
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,878
Three, two, one, just gonna squish it down.

611
00:14:02,878 --> 00:14:03,857
- [Both] Oh!

612
00:14:03,857 --> 00:14:05,000
- [Collins] Man.

613
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,370
- [Devan] This is some edible glue here

614
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:08,140
I'm gonna put on the outside of my balloon,

615
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,270
to make these noodles stick.

616
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,520
- Let's see how this turned out, here we go.

617
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,643
Three, two, one.

618
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:13,460
(both yelling)

619
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,840
It's an actual waffle.

620
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,952
- Three, two, one.

621
00:14:15,952 --> 00:14:17,123
(balloon pops)

622
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:18,129
(Collins screams)

623
00:14:18,129 --> 00:14:20,303
Look at that, it's my pasta bowl made of pasta.

624
00:14:21,298 --> 00:14:22,131
- All right, well we've got all the ingredients

625
00:14:22,131 --> 00:14:23,110
and now it's time to make our final school hack lunches.

626
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,550
The school hack lunches are all done,

627
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:26,220
and my mouth is watering right now.

628
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,066
- [Both] These look amazing.

629
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:28,820
- So here is the big reveal.

630
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,220
- [Both] Three, two, oh!

631
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,320
- Five second subscribe challenge.

632
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,000
We wanna see if you can subscribe to this channel

633
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,230
and turn on the channel post notifications in five seconds.

634
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,063
You ready?

635
00:14:37,063 --> 00:14:37,897
Here we go.

636
00:14:37,897 --> 00:14:42,168
[Both] Five, four, three, two, one, done.

637
00:14:42,168 --> 00:14:43,001
- If you can do that,

638
00:14:43,001 --> 00:14:44,020
comment down below Keyper Squad right now.

639
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,566
- [Both] Three, two, one, tada!

640
00:14:45,566 --> 00:14:46,787
- [Collins] These both look amazing.

641
00:14:46,787 --> 00:14:48,496
You get to comment down below

642
00:14:48,496 --> 00:14:52,664
whose school lunch hack is going to taste better.

643
00:14:52,664 --> 00:14:53,497
We'll be finding out the $10,000 winner

644
00:14:53,497 --> 00:14:54,490
at the end of the video.

645
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:55,440
We've got all the school hacks,

646
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,380
and now it's time to test them

647
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,410
to find out who's gonna win the $10,000.

648
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:00,990
It is time for the egg drop test, and I gotta say man,

649
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,850
looking at both of these, I do not know

650
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:04,153
which one's gonna successfully be able to do it man.

651
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,597
- I know, this did not quite fulfill my vision for it.

652
00:15:06,597 --> 00:15:08,420
- [Collins] But right now it's time for us to hop outside

653
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,590
and see which one is able

654
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,170
to better protect its egg from cracking.

655
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:12,250
We've got our eggs,

656
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,470
and now it's time to drop them to see

657
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:15,450
if they'll actually be able to withstand the impact.

658
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:17,420
I think, did a pretty good job on the construction here,

659
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,253
what about you?

660
00:15:18,253 --> 00:15:19,810
- I don't know about mine, mine's falling apart already.

661
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:20,898
- This is a pretty high drop, man,

662
00:15:20,898 --> 00:15:22,350
we're gonna be trying to hit the bullseye.

663
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:23,250
For the baseline test,

664
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,270
we're gonna drop a real unprotected ostrich egg

665
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,580
to see if that cracks on the ground.

666
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,910
And here is the unprotected ostrich egg.

667
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:29,743
Three.

668
00:15:29,743 --> 00:15:30,576
- [Both] Two, one.

669
00:15:30,576 --> 00:15:31,810
(egg splattering)

670
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:33,260
- [Both] Oh!

671
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,000
- [Devan] Did that crack the cement?

672
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,960
- [Collins] I don't know, man, that was quick.

673
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,793
- How bout this, Collins?

674
00:15:37,793 --> 00:15:39,810
I'm gonna hop down there, you chuck it down,

675
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:41,040
and we'll assess the damage.

676
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,250
- The way that that egg broke,

677
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,600
I don't know if this'll be able

678
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,609
to fully withstand the impact.

679
00:15:44,609 --> 00:15:45,730
- I don't know, dude,

680
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:47,680
I think you have a huge chance of success.

681
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,468
- The thing about mine is,

682
00:15:49,468 --> 00:15:50,448
I've got a giant squishie,

683
00:15:50,448 --> 00:15:51,281
that was the first thing I cut open,

684
00:15:51,281 --> 00:15:52,460
then I covered it in a whole bunch of gallium,

685
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:55,310
we've got slime in here, and the baking soda and water.

686
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:56,560
That reaction that happened coated it

687
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,230
in an unbreakable substance, man.

688
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,350
In a scale of one to ten, Devan,

689
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:00,692
where do you think this one falls, in terms of uh,

690
00:16:00,692 --> 00:16:03,930
ten being it has full chance of making it, one, it's done.

691
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:06,070
- I think you've got like a solid eight and a half.

692
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:06,970
- An eight and a half.

693
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,070
I don't know.

694
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:08,903
Should I just kinda like, hold it out,

695
00:16:08,903 --> 00:16:09,736
and then just drop it?

696
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:11,640
- No, you've gotta give it a nice throw, or maybe a lob up.

697
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,473
- Three.

698
00:16:12,473 --> 00:16:13,678
- [Both] Two, one.

699
00:16:13,678 --> 00:16:14,929
(egg splatters on the ground)

700
00:16:14,929 --> 00:16:16,070
- [Both] Oh!

701
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:16,903
- [Collins] Oh, no.

702
00:16:16,903 --> 00:16:18,610
- [Devan] Orbeez everywhere!

703
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:19,510
- [Collins] Oh no.

704
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,943
- I don't know if that was so good for you, man.

705
00:16:21,943 --> 00:16:23,470
- [Collins] I think the bottom of the bag,

706
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:24,370
I think burst open.

707
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:25,560
- [Devan] Oh my goodness.

708
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,829
- We're gonna take the bag apart afterwards to see,

709
00:16:26,829 --> 00:16:28,550
if it stayed intact.

710
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:29,410
Devan, you wanna, you wanna trade,

711
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:30,243
so you wanna come up here?

712
00:16:30,243 --> 00:16:31,342
- Yeah, I'll go up there.

713
00:16:31,342 --> 00:16:32,175
- [Collins] All right so we do a little switch right now.

714
00:16:32,175 --> 00:16:33,008
- This is gonna be super interesting,

715
00:16:33,008 --> 00:16:34,870
because I coated my egg in a watermelon

716
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:35,980
I popped with rubber bands.

717
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:36,879
Cement on the inside.

718
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:38,900
Oh yeah, not to mention oobleck

719
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,350
on the outside for safe measure.

720
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:42,407
I can hear the egg moving around in mine.

721
00:16:42,407 --> 00:16:43,240
- That's not good.

722
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,470
- That is not a good sign.

723
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:45,560
- [Collins] The nest on the inside.

724
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,393
That's what really blows my mind, because like,

725
00:16:46,393 --> 00:16:48,410
I think that that might be your saving, what?

726
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:49,364
- I almost just dropped it.

727
00:16:49,364 --> 00:16:50,260
Here we go.

728
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,458
- [Both] Three, two.

729
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:52,291
- Wait up, wait.

730
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:53,770
If you wanna win a fifteen minute video call

731
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:56,870
with Devan and I, text the word school to 81800 right now.

732
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,608
So pause the video, text the word school to 81800,

733
00:16:58,608 --> 00:17:00,540
you'll automatically be entered in to win,

734
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,580
and let's see how this goes.

735
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,536
- [Both] Three, two, one!

736
00:17:03,536 --> 00:17:05,313
(egg thudding)

737
00:17:05,313 --> 00:17:06,771
- [Collins] No way!

738
00:17:06,771 --> 00:17:07,604
- [Devan] No way!

739
00:17:07,604 --> 00:17:08,870
- [Collins] That was a solid thud,

740
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:10,172
like it did not crack at all.

741
00:17:10,172 --> 00:17:12,110
- Dude, I think I just won.

742
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,693
- Ah, yeah, let's grab these eggs, let's hop back inside.

743
00:17:13,693 --> 00:17:15,930
Now it's time for the moment we've all been waiting for,

744
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:18,975
time to find out which egg was able to withstand the drop.

745
00:17:18,975 --> 00:17:19,808
So how 'bout this,

746
00:17:19,808 --> 00:17:20,641
we'll start with yours first.

747
00:17:20,641 --> 00:17:21,960
- [Devan] Yeah, I think this Flex Seal Tape

748
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,110
is gonna be a lot to get through, so I brought a saw

749
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:24,943
to get into mine.

750
00:17:24,943 --> 00:17:26,020
- Yeah, do not try this at home.

751
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:26,853
Oh!

752
00:17:26,853 --> 00:17:27,686
There's a crack, wait wait wait wait wait.

753
00:17:28,613 --> 00:17:29,446
- [Devan] I can see it, all right.

754
00:17:29,446 --> 00:17:30,470
- Here we go, the big reveal, let's see if it worked, ready?

755
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:32,461
- [Both] Three, two, one.

756
00:17:32,461 --> 00:17:33,294
No!

757
00:17:34,245 --> 00:17:35,850
- I thought this would work.

758
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:38,130
- It's not even like cracked, it's obliterated.

759
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:40,420
If that's what happened to yours, what happened to mine?

760
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,430
All right, well, let's take the bag open here,

761
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:43,480
we've got all the squishies, we got the toast.

762
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,650
Don't forget about the toast.

763
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:45,483
So the first bag got breached,

764
00:17:45,483 --> 00:17:47,680
but did the second bag pop open?

765
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,400
Here we go, let's, oh, yes, it did!

766
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,233
Look at that.

767
00:17:50,233 --> 00:17:51,445
- Orbeez everywhere!

768
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:52,278
- Look at that!

769
00:17:52,278 --> 00:17:53,111
- [Devan] Oh, jeez.

770
00:17:53,111 --> 00:17:53,944
- [Collins] Here's the egg.

771
00:17:53,944 --> 00:17:55,444
- [Devan] The slime is like fully coating it, man.

772
00:17:55,444 --> 00:17:56,277
- [Collins] All right here we go,

773
00:17:56,277 --> 00:17:57,110
we got the egg here, so let's see if we can just

774
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,102
pull off some chunks of slime, like this.

775
00:17:58,102 --> 00:17:59,790
The real question though, man, is did it survive?

776
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,200
I am so concerned right now.

777
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,170
Come on.

778
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:03,330
All right, well, uh, fun fact,

779
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:04,630
it's very difficult to find out where,

780
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:05,463
how I closed this thing.

781
00:18:05,463 --> 00:18:06,296
- Oh dear.

782
00:18:06,296 --> 00:18:07,243
- Yo, here we go, let's see if we can just tear it open.

783
00:18:07,243 --> 00:18:08,396
- [Both] Ohh!

784
00:18:08,396 --> 00:18:09,229
- What?

785
00:18:09,229 --> 00:18:10,062
What, what, what, what, what?

786
00:18:10,062 --> 00:18:10,895
- I just saw something.

787
00:18:10,895 --> 00:18:11,910
You ready for the big reveal?

788
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:12,743
- I'm ready.

789
00:18:12,743 --> 00:18:13,660
- All right, here we go.

790
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,680
- [Both] Three, two, one.

791
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,513
- [Collins] Let's give it a tear.

792
00:18:15,513 --> 00:18:16,346
- [Devan] What, what, I can't see it yet.

793
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:19,903
- Look at it, it's perfect! - No!

794
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:22,225
- Not even a scratch.

795
00:18:22,225 --> 00:18:23,491
- No way!

796
00:18:23,491 --> 00:18:24,911
One hundred percent intact.

797
00:18:24,911 --> 00:18:25,744
You get to comment down below,

798
00:18:25,744 --> 00:18:27,190
what is one ingredient you would use

799
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,100
to save Devan's egg from not cracking.

800
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,650
Got the ultimate school hack lunches,

801
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,530
and now it's time to find out which one tastes better.

802
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:35,148
My delicious infused crust pizza, or your whack bowl.

803
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:36,650
- [Devan] Yeah, I think we should try

804
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,577
your bland dish over here.

805
00:18:38,577 --> 00:18:39,511
- Whoa.

806
00:18:39,511 --> 00:18:41,405
Let's start off with my grilled cheese tater tots,

807
00:18:41,405 --> 00:18:42,850
I gotta say, oh boy, it's a little um, crumbly.

808
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:44,130
You want the bigger one or the smaller one?

809
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:45,200
- I'll take the smaller one.

810
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,540
It smells really good.

811
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,373
- Whoa.

812
00:18:47,373 --> 00:18:48,206
- I'm actually really excited for this.

813
00:18:48,206 --> 00:18:49,039
- Yeah, I'm pretty thrilled for this.

814
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,303
- I hope this works.

815
00:18:50,303 --> 00:18:51,570
(Collins whoops)

816
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:52,403
- Let's uh, let's touch tots.

817
00:18:52,403 --> 00:18:53,363
- [Both] Three, two, one.

818
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,513
- Whoa!

819
00:18:57,513 --> 00:18:58,695
Whoa!

820
00:18:58,695 --> 00:19:00,060
- I wouldn't say it's quite a whoa, or a whoa,

821
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,471
but you know, I think it's pretty solid.

822
00:19:01,471 --> 00:19:02,304
- What?

823
00:19:02,304 --> 00:19:03,900
Yours has a pretty high bar to climb

824
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,927
if it really wants to reach it man.

825
00:19:04,927 --> 00:19:06,340
Did you put peppers on there?

826
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,173
- Yes.

827
00:19:07,173 --> 00:19:08,006
Were you watching what I was doing?

828
00:19:08,006 --> 00:19:08,839
- Not really.

829
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:09,672
- [Devan] I will offer you the choice,

830
00:19:09,672 --> 00:19:10,505
which slice do you want.

831
00:19:10,505 --> 00:19:11,830
These are your only two choices.

832
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,183
- [Both] Three, two, one.

833
00:19:14,758 --> 00:19:15,591
- Mmm.

834
00:19:15,591 --> 00:19:16,424
- Whoa.

835
00:19:16,424 --> 00:19:17,257
Is there anymore of that?

836
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:18,090
- I wish I did, but no, I already ate it.

837
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:18,923
- [Collins] Wow.

838
00:19:18,923 --> 00:19:19,756
I didn't think it was possible,

839
00:19:19,756 --> 00:19:21,410
but that was better than the tater tots man.

840
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,400
- Way better.

841
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,233
Like, million times better.

842
00:19:23,233 --> 00:19:25,860
- [Collins] It comes down to the main dish, Devan.

843
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:26,850
I'll take this slice over here.

844
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:27,719
Oh, there we go.

845
00:19:27,719 --> 00:19:29,013
Look at that, you see the relish in there.

846
00:19:29,013 --> 00:19:30,852
I'm folding it over like this,

847
00:19:30,852 --> 00:19:31,685
and I'm gonna take a bite over here,

848
00:19:31,685 --> 00:19:33,480
so I get the sauce, the cheese, the relish and the crust,

849
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,313
all in one, bam.

850
00:19:34,313 --> 00:19:36,183
- [Both] Three, two, one.

851
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:38,770
- Whoa. - Wow.

852
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:40,410
I wasn't totally sure on this combo.

853
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:41,243
- That is interesting.

854
00:19:41,243 --> 00:19:43,480
Yours, I don't think is gonna be able to top that.

855
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,640
- [Devan] Three, two, one.

856
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,703
- [Collins] Why is it a brick?

857
00:19:45,703 --> 00:19:46,717
These should be individual pieces.

858
00:19:46,717 --> 00:19:48,040
- It formed to the bowl.

859
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:48,873
Here you go.

860
00:19:48,873 --> 00:19:50,700
- Wait, so I get a whole, I get a whole slice of this.

861
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,533
- Right, here we go.

862
00:19:51,533 --> 00:19:52,740
- [Both] Three, two.

863
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:53,677

871
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:06,603
- [Both] Three, two, one.

872
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:10,863
- Oh.

873
00:20:10,863 --> 00:20:12,128
- Whoa, huh, okay.

874
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:13,378
- The textures.

875
00:20:16,104 --> 00:20:16,937
- This is not good.

876
00:20:16,937 --> 00:20:18,660
- [Collins] You get to comment down below,

877
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,720
whose school lunch do you think tasted better,

878
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,440
and we'll be finding out the $10,000 winner

879
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,380
at the end of the video.

880
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,420
We got the edible glue stick,

881
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,870
we've tested all the school hacks,

882
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:25,860
and now it's time to find out

883
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,360
who is truly worthy of the $10,000.

884
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,350
So for the egg drop,

885
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,800
I think I was definitely the clear winner.

886
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,888
I mean, my egg actually stayed intact.

887
00:20:32,888 --> 00:20:34,310
Whereas yours, just shattered everywhere.

888
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:36,701
So there we go, one point to me.

889
00:20:36,701 --> 00:20:37,534
Now for the art project,

890
00:20:37,534 --> 00:20:38,560
I gotta give that one to you Devan,

891
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,820
I think you had some cool stuff.

892
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,937
You made electric grass, you smashed up little duckies.

893
00:20:41,937 --> 00:20:44,610
It was pretty wild, so there we go, point for you.

894
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,250
But now what it comes down to is the school hack lunches,

895
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,610
and this one, is a bit of a toss up, man.

896
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:50,866
There's a lot of crazy things that we did in this,

897
00:20:50,866 --> 00:20:52,921
and I gotta say although you won the appetizers,

898
00:20:52,921 --> 00:20:55,590
I won the main dish, but that being said.

899
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,706
- [Devan] Uh huh.

900
00:20:56,706 --> 00:20:58,510
My appetizer was pretty good.

901
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:00,210
- [Collins] And I think if we compare your appetizer

902
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:02,620
to my main dish, Devan wins the video.

903
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,453
- [Devan] Yes!

904
00:21:03,453 --> 00:21:04,850
- [Collins] So that means you win the $10,000

905
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:06,010
and the giant edible glue stick.

906
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:07,240
But now it's time to find out

907
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,731
what this edible glue stick actually tastes like.

908
00:21:08,731 --> 00:21:09,564
- [Devan] I know right?

909
00:21:09,564 --> 00:21:10,750
- Can I feel how heavy this thing is?

910
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,340
- It is really, really, heavy.

911
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,406
- Oh my gosh.

912
00:21:13,406 --> 00:21:14,339
- You gotta hold onto it.

913
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:15,548
- You got it, you got it, you got it?

914
00:21:15,548 --> 00:21:16,381
- I'm super strong.

915
00:21:16,381 --> 00:21:17,330
Holy cow, that's heavy.

916
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:18,760
- Stand up, stand up, I got you.

917
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,491
- You should just take it back.

918
00:21:20,491 --> 00:21:22,313
- I will take it, I will take it.

919
00:21:22,313 --> 00:21:24,008
I don't even know how I'm gonna eat this.

920
00:21:24,008 --> 00:21:24,897
- I think I gotta hold it for you.

921
00:21:24,897 --> 00:21:25,825
- Oh, okay yeah, sure.

922
00:21:25,825 --> 00:21:26,658
You got it?

923
00:21:26,658 --> 00:21:27,491
- I got it.

924
00:21:27,491 --> 00:21:28,324
- You 100% got it?

925
00:21:28,324 --> 00:21:29,157
- I 100% got it, Devan.

926
00:21:29,157 --> 00:21:29,990
- Three, two, one.

927
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:30,823
Ah.

928
00:21:30,823 --> 00:21:32,086
Ow.

929
00:21:32,086 --> 00:21:32,919
- I can't see, is it working?

930
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:33,752
- No.

931
00:21:33,752 --> 00:21:34,585
It's way harder than I expected.

932
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:35,418
- It's gotten on your teeth.

933
00:21:35,418 --> 00:21:36,600
Wait, smile Devan, smile forward.

934
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,433
Does it taste good?

935
00:21:37,433 --> 00:21:38,287
- It's definitely edible, and it tastes delicious.

936
00:21:38,287 --> 00:21:39,860
- Well this is getting super heavy,

937
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:40,790

You got give seconds, here we go.

940
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,990
- [Both] Five, four, three, two, one, done.

941
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,065
- We love you, no!

942
00:21:49,065 --> 00:21:49,898
Bye!

943
00:21:49,898 --> 00:21:50,944
- Bye!

944
00:21:50,944 --> 00:21:52,440
- Have you not seen this, it's literally rolling.

945
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,840
- I see it, but you've ruined a rollerskate.

946
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,900
- I did not ruin this, Devan,

947
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,700
it is made better by what I've done.

948
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,910
- You're getting feathers everywhere.

949
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:00,787
- It's shedding season for my rainbow smash over here.
