1
00:00:00,239 --> 00:00:01,451
- You guys, this is gonna be so weird.

2
00:00:01,451 --> 00:00:03,817
This meant gummy food versus real food smoothie.

3
00:00:03,817 --> 00:00:05,269
Let's blend it up, alright.

4
00:00:05,269 --> 00:00:06,602
Three, two, one.

5
00:00:07,782 --> 00:00:09,067
Yay.

6
00:00:09,067 --> 00:00:10,199
Dude, I got a gummy burger.

7
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:11,263
- Dude, I got a real one.

8
00:00:11,263 --> 00:00:12,275
They're both awesome.

9
00:00:12,275 --> 00:00:14,411
- No, that is not good, Devan 'cause at the end of this,

10
00:00:14,411 --> 00:00:17,311
you have to put this in the blender, and then drink it.

11
00:00:17,311 --> 00:00:18,420
- Oh, wait, why?

12
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,326
- This is the gummy food

13
00:00:19,326 --> 00:00:21,320
versus real food smoothie challenge.

14
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,932
- Oh, this is gonna be so gross.

15
00:00:22,932 --> 00:00:23,765
- It's gonna be so nasty.

16
00:00:23,765 --> 00:00:24,598
Here we go.

17
00:00:24,598 --> 00:00:26,181
Burger cheers, aye.

18
00:00:29,885 --> 00:00:31,123
- That was a long bite.

19
00:00:31,123 --> 00:00:32,141
- Oh my gosh, bro.

20
00:00:32,141 --> 00:00:32,974
- How was it?

21
00:00:32,974 --> 00:00:33,807
- It's so good.

22
00:00:33,807 --> 00:00:34,952
I wanted like half of the burger too, look at this.

23
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:37,039
Boom, there's no other piece left.

24
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:38,936
- You just have to eat the burger.

25
00:00:38,936 --> 00:00:41,383
- (mumbling) this burger was absolutely delicious,

26
00:00:41,383 --> 00:00:44,383
but now the time has come to add it.

27
00:00:45,276 --> 00:00:46,199
- How?

28
00:00:46,199 --> 00:00:47,406
Wait, how about you hold it - I'm gonna break this.

29
00:00:47,406 --> 00:00:48,660
- And, I'll take off the top.

30
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:49,912
Alright. - Okay.

31
00:00:49,912 --> 00:00:50,745
Yay.

32
00:00:50,745 --> 00:00:51,649
- Teamwork makes the dream work.

33
00:00:51,649 --> 00:00:52,482
- Yay.

34
00:00:52,482 --> 00:00:53,594
(clacking)

35
00:00:53,594 --> 00:00:54,427
- Don't we need that?

36
00:00:54,427 --> 00:00:56,060
- I was hoping it wouldn't hit the glass table back there

37
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,378
'cause we do need the glass table.

38
00:00:57,378 --> 00:00:59,086
- Alright, you got it?

39
00:00:59,086 --> 00:00:59,919
- I got it.

40
00:00:59,919 --> 00:01:01,923
Aye, pew (giggles).

41
00:01:01,923 --> 00:01:03,409
For this round, as you guys know, there are,

42
00:01:03,409 --> 00:01:04,994
what are you even doing over there, guys?

43
00:01:04,994 --> 00:01:06,002
- Peace sign, number two.

44
00:01:06,002 --> 00:01:07,164
- Oh, round number two, yeah.

45
00:01:07,164 --> 00:01:08,818
You guys, we're gonna keep it or switch it.

46
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:10,134
So, Devan, would you like to keep 'em

47
00:01:10,134 --> 00:01:11,505
or switch 'em right now?

48
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:12,675
- I think I want to keep it.

49
00:01:12,675 --> 00:01:14,188
I'm feeling good, it looks good,

50
00:01:14,188 --> 00:01:15,914
I get some good vibes from this one.

51
00:01:15,914 --> 00:01:17,353
- You gettin' good vibes, alright, here we go.

52
00:01:17,353 --> 00:01:18,625
Three, two, one, go.

53
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:20,387
- That was fail, hey.

54
00:01:20,387 --> 00:01:24,221
- Dude, I love sushi and gummy sushi.

55
00:01:24,221 --> 00:01:25,693
(lip smacking)

56
00:01:25,693 --> 00:01:26,526
Delicious.

57
00:01:26,526 --> 00:01:27,359
- Oh, look at that.

58
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:28,655
- Bro, I'm like a preying mantis right now.

59
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:29,762
I'm like (cackling).

60
00:01:29,762 --> 00:01:31,252
- Is that the sound of a preying mantis?

61
00:01:31,252 --> 00:01:32,085
- Yes.

62
00:01:32,085 --> 00:01:33,930
(cackling)

63
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:34,854
- A lot of people eat it with their hands,

64
00:01:34,854 --> 00:01:35,913
but you can stick it through that.

65
00:01:35,913 --> 00:01:36,754
- Alright, so here we go.

66
00:01:36,754 --> 00:01:37,994
You ready, three, - Alright, I'm ready.

67
00:01:37,994 --> 00:01:38,827
Two, one.

68
00:01:40,305 --> 00:01:41,451
- Oh my God.

69
00:01:41,451 --> 00:01:43,451
It's like a marshmallow.

70
00:01:45,992 --> 00:01:47,246
- It doesn't look like you're enjoying this.

71
00:01:47,246 --> 00:01:48,722
- It's sour, man.

72
00:01:48,722 --> 00:01:51,023
- Wait, what, what sushi is sour?

73
00:01:51,023 --> 00:01:51,856
- Why.

74
00:01:51,856 --> 00:01:53,471
- Mine is delicious, so.

75
00:01:53,471 --> 00:01:55,587
- Dude, it's in a tiny, little container.

76
00:01:55,587 --> 00:01:56,420
It's so cute.

77
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,618
(gasping) look at this (gasping).

78
00:01:59,618 --> 00:02:00,964
It's like a seaweed.

79
00:02:00,964 --> 00:02:01,797
I'm a walrus.

80
00:02:01,797 --> 00:02:02,655
(walrus squealing)

81
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:04,025
Hey, what's up, dude.

82
00:02:04,025 --> 00:02:05,764
- Oh, dude, you just suck it up like a noodle.

83
00:02:05,764 --> 00:02:06,597
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

84
00:02:06,597 --> 00:02:07,512
- Like spaghetti.

85
00:02:07,512 --> 00:02:08,345
(slurping)

86
00:02:08,345 --> 00:02:10,061
(gagging)

87
00:02:10,061 --> 00:02:11,513
(mumbling)

88
00:02:11,513 --> 00:02:12,346
Not bad.

89
00:02:12,346 --> 00:02:13,320
- Dude, it tastes like root beer.

90
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,153
- Really?

91
00:02:14,153 --> 00:02:14,986
Really?

92
00:02:14,986 --> 00:02:15,819
- Yeah, you try.

93
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:16,652
- No.

94
00:02:16,652 --> 00:02:17,546
- If I'm gonna put these in the blender,

95
00:02:17,546 --> 00:02:19,282
I'm just gonna keep eating these, so I'm gonna get a pop.

96
00:02:19,282 --> 00:02:20,970
Plohp, that one in there.

97
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,031
- Sushi and a burger?

98
00:02:22,031 --> 00:02:23,466
That's gonna be so gross.

99
00:02:23,466 --> 00:02:25,010
- No, no.

100
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:27,220
I cannot wait to start drinking of mine smoothies.

101
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,053
This looks so good.

102
00:02:28,053 --> 00:02:29,654
- Yeah, not so much for me.

103
00:02:29,654 --> 00:02:30,879
This looks nasty.

104
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,523
Anyways, you wanna keep it or switch it?

105
00:02:32,523 --> 00:02:35,205
- My decision is I'm going to keep it.

106
00:02:35,205 --> 00:02:36,538
Sike, switch it.

107
00:02:37,755 --> 00:02:38,588
Yeah.

108
00:02:38,588 --> 00:02:39,898
I think I had a little bit too much sugar right now,

109
00:02:39,898 --> 00:02:42,259
and like my energy level's gotten like bee-oh,

110
00:02:42,259 --> 00:02:43,749
off the roof, off chain.

111
00:02:43,749 --> 00:02:45,490
One, two, three, four, change.

112
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:48,013
- Hey, I got a gummy one this time.

113
00:02:48,013 --> 00:02:49,390
- Bro, my pickles ain't crisp.

114
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,223
Bro, look at this.

115
00:02:50,223 --> 00:02:51,434
You see how I'm squeezin' it?

116
00:02:51,434 --> 00:02:54,377
You cannot do this to a new, fresh pickle.

117
00:02:54,377 --> 00:02:55,265
Well, Devan, on the bright side,

118
00:02:55,265 --> 00:02:57,148
you finally got a gummy to add to your smoothie.

119
00:02:57,148 --> 00:02:59,167
- What, this is the worst gummy to get.

120
00:02:59,167 --> 00:03:00,396
It doesn't even smell good.

121
00:03:00,396 --> 00:03:01,229
Smell it.

122
00:03:01,229 --> 00:03:02,062
- Oh my gosh.

123
00:03:02,062 --> 00:03:02,991
Dude, it smells like a pickle. - I know.

124
00:03:02,991 --> 00:03:03,829
It smells terrible.

125
00:03:03,829 --> 00:03:04,894
- It smells more like a pickle than this.

126
00:03:04,894 --> 00:03:06,667
If it smells like a pickle and if it looks like a pickle,

127
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:08,006
your gummy might taste like a pickle.

128
00:03:08,006 --> 00:03:08,964
So, let's find out right now.

129
00:03:08,964 --> 00:03:09,797
You ready?

130
00:03:09,797 --> 00:03:10,630
Here we go.

131
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,463
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

132
00:03:11,463 --> 00:03:12,888
we'd have to get a challenge for you.

133
00:03:12,888 --> 00:03:14,971
We want to see if you can subscribe to this challenge,

134
00:03:14,971 --> 00:03:17,212
put it on, ow, channel post notifications

135
00:03:17,212 --> 00:03:20,422
to give this video a thumbs up in seven seconds.

136
00:03:20,422 --> 00:03:21,255
Can you do it?

137
00:03:21,255 --> 00:03:22,088
Here we go.

138
00:03:22,088 --> 00:03:25,921
Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, done.

139
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:28,803
If you can do that, comment down below,

140
00:03:28,803 --> 00:03:31,608
Keyper Squad right now and Devan, let's take our bite.

141
00:03:31,608 --> 00:03:33,191
Let's go. - Alright.

142
00:03:35,576 --> 00:03:36,409
- Mm.

143
00:03:36,409 --> 00:03:37,242
- Ugh.

144
00:03:37,242 --> 00:03:38,218
It's sort of spicy.

145
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,051
- What?

146
00:03:39,051 --> 00:03:40,374
- It's sort of pickle-eeh.

147
00:03:40,374 --> 00:03:42,540
Bro, who eats a pickle like that?

148
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,373
- Me.

149
00:03:43,373 --> 00:03:44,206
I love pickles.

150
00:03:44,206 --> 00:03:45,039
Pop, pop.

151
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:46,307
Your turn, Devan, do you want to keep 'em or switch 'em?

152
00:03:46,307 --> 00:03:48,747
- Uh, I wanna switch it 'cause last time was terrible.

153
00:03:48,747 --> 00:03:49,580
I'm switching.

154
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,777
- Alright, we're switching it, here we go.

155
00:03:50,777 --> 00:03:52,829
Three, two, one.

156
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:53,662
No. - Yeah.

157
00:03:55,115 --> 00:03:56,800
You got the real lemon.

158
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,215
(laughing)

159
00:03:58,215 --> 00:03:59,944
- I have had it with eating lemon.

160
00:03:59,944 --> 00:04:01,754
Birds on YouTube, then I'm on Disney Channel,

161
00:04:01,754 --> 00:04:04,225
and then right now, bro, I am not about this.

162
00:04:04,225 --> 00:04:05,960
- This isn't even sour.

163
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,400
This is so sweet. - Are you kidding me?

164
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,344
Alright, here we go.

165
00:04:08,344 --> 00:04:09,552
This is gonna-

166
00:04:09,552 --> 00:04:11,243
- No, you just got to eat it, dude.

167
00:04:11,243 --> 00:04:13,743
Come on. - Dude, that was sour.

168
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,294
- What happened?

169
00:04:17,294 --> 00:04:18,377
- Why is it so sour?

170
00:04:18,377 --> 00:04:19,891
My lips are burning.

171
00:04:19,891 --> 00:04:21,670
I can't, I can't, I can't do it.

172
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,240
- Alright, you did good, you did a good job.

173
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,550
You can dump it in there now.

174
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:25,436
- Dude, it's so sour.

175
00:04:25,436 --> 00:04:27,390
Alright, onto the next round, ow.

176
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,700
- Alright, it is your turn to call us.

177
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,048
Do you want to keep it or switch it?

178
00:04:30,048 --> 00:04:31,207
- Dude, the thing is right now, Devan,

179
00:04:31,207 --> 00:04:33,781
I'm feeling extraordinary.

180
00:04:33,781 --> 00:04:34,614
- What?

181
00:04:34,614 --> 00:04:36,257
- Extraordinary, so I'm gonna keep it.

182
00:04:36,257 --> 00:04:37,090
- (chuckles) okay.

183
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,141
Three, two, one.

184
00:04:38,141 --> 00:04:39,165
- Yeah.

185
00:04:39,165 --> 00:04:41,134
Oh my God. - It's a pizza.

186
00:04:41,134 --> 00:04:43,170
- Oh my God, it's a pizza.

187
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:44,920
This is the greatest.

188
00:04:45,923 --> 00:04:47,530
Yo, I wonder if I can spin it on one finger.

189
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,936
Oh yeah, my pizza's so good.

190
00:04:48,936 --> 00:04:49,769
Oh, look at my cheese.

191
00:04:49,769 --> 00:04:51,604
- Wait, wait, wait, toss it to Mike, toss it to Mike.

192
00:04:51,604 --> 00:04:53,842
- Three, two, one, bee-oh.

193
00:04:53,842 --> 00:04:57,106
- Ah, oh no, oh no, we'll cut that out.

194
00:04:57,106 --> 00:04:57,939
It never happened.

195
00:04:57,939 --> 00:04:58,772
- Yup, never happened.

196
00:04:58,772 --> 00:04:59,605
(beep)

197
00:04:59,605 --> 00:05:00,741
Ugh, it's so stretchy.

198
00:05:00,741 --> 00:05:01,738
See, this is what happens, guys.

199
00:05:01,738 --> 00:05:03,733
A little life half when you get a small pizza,

200
00:05:03,733 --> 00:05:05,563
and you really want a large, you just do this

201
00:05:05,563 --> 00:05:08,409
with your pizza, and then, suddenly, you'll have a large.

202
00:05:08,409 --> 00:05:09,319
- It works every time.

203
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:10,152
What?

204
00:05:10,152 --> 00:05:11,499
How's that effective?

205
00:05:11,499 --> 00:05:12,617
Have you eaten it?

206
00:05:12,617 --> 00:05:14,244
Have you had any of it yet?

207
00:05:14,244 --> 00:05:16,023
- None, but I put all this teeth marks around it.

208
00:05:16,023 --> 00:05:17,231
- Yeah, so now, I can't eat it.

209
00:05:17,231 --> 00:05:18,304
- Yup, exactly.

210
00:05:18,304 --> 00:05:19,626
It's a way to protect your pizza.

211
00:05:19,626 --> 00:05:21,860
- Oh, that's a lot of gummy.

212
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,958
(laughing) - Mm, so delicious, okay.

213
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:24,791
- Alright.

214
00:05:25,846 --> 00:05:27,137
Alright, onto the next one.

215
00:05:27,137 --> 00:05:28,562
- I have gummy in my teeth.

216
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:29,956
- Alright, it is your turn again.

217
00:05:29,956 --> 00:05:31,948
Do you wanna keep it or do you wanna switch it?

218
00:05:31,948 --> 00:05:32,781
- I have a feeling

219
00:05:32,781 --> 00:05:34,713
this one's gonna be a very important decision right now,

220
00:05:34,713 --> 00:05:36,900
so I'm gonna go dangerous, switch it.

221
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,227
- Switch it, alright, here we go.

222
00:05:38,227 --> 00:05:39,727
- Three, two, one.

223
00:05:40,661 --> 00:05:41,494
- No.

224
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:45,323
What are the chances of getting peppers twice?

225
00:05:45,323 --> 00:05:47,202
The smoothie's gonna be spicy.

226
00:05:47,202 --> 00:05:48,685
- Oh my gosh, didn't even think about that.

227
00:05:48,685 --> 00:05:49,518
- Ugh.

228
00:05:49,518 --> 00:05:50,351
- We'll do this again.

229
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:51,184
We'll start with the green one,

230
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,827
and work our way down to the yellow one.

231
00:05:52,827 --> 00:05:53,707
- I remember this one.

232
00:05:53,707 --> 00:05:54,613
This one wasn't bad.

233
00:05:54,613 --> 00:05:56,113
It was a green pepper. - You ready?

234
00:05:56,113 --> 00:05:58,030
Three, two, one. - Yeah.

235
00:05:58,908 --> 00:06:01,153
(hacking) I can't, oh, it is bad.

236
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:01,998
Oh, it's way worse.

237
00:06:01,998 --> 00:06:03,330
A lot of times I put one in spicy.

238
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,747
- Red one's next, here we go.

239
00:06:06,729 --> 00:06:07,562
- Ah.

240
00:06:07,562 --> 00:06:08,395
- Oh my gosh.

241
00:06:08,395 --> 00:06:09,228
- It's on fire.

242
00:06:09,228 --> 00:06:10,646
- It starts young, now it's gummy.

243
00:06:10,646 --> 00:06:12,993
Unless they think they're hot.

244
00:06:12,993 --> 00:06:13,831
Spicy (mumbles) man.

245
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:14,664
- Ah.

246
00:06:14,664 --> 00:06:15,497
- Are you okay?

247
00:06:15,497 --> 00:06:18,775
Oh my gosh, why is it so spicy when it's gummy, man?

248
00:06:18,775 --> 00:06:20,630
And, last but not least, yellow one.

249
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,463
This one's the worst.

250
00:06:21,463 --> 00:06:23,972
Here we go, three, two, one.

251
00:06:23,972 --> 00:06:24,805
- Ah.

252
00:06:24,805 --> 00:06:26,222
- Mm, ow, ow, ow.

253
00:06:28,253 --> 00:06:29,487
Now, we're gonna add these in too.

254
00:06:29,487 --> 00:06:31,025
And then, you're gonna pop those in boom boom,

255
00:06:31,025 --> 00:06:31,952
and we can leave that one out.

256
00:06:31,952 --> 00:06:34,434
Ow, my mouth is burning on fire.

257
00:06:34,434 --> 00:06:35,267
- I need milk.

258
00:06:35,267 --> 00:06:36,565
- You need milk, alright.

259
00:06:36,565 --> 00:06:37,988
- Oh, I feel lightheaded.

260
00:06:37,988 --> 00:06:39,170
(slurping)

261
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:40,125
Mm.

262
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:40,987
You have no idea.

263
00:06:40,987 --> 00:06:42,825
My teeth are literally tingling.

264
00:06:42,825 --> 00:06:44,842
- Devan, you are suffering right now, so you know what,

265
00:06:44,842 --> 00:06:46,790
it's your turn to choose one, keep 'em or switch 'em?

266
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:47,659
- I wanna keep 'em.

267
00:06:47,659 --> 00:06:48,492
- Keep 'em?

268
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:49,325
Alright, here we go.

269
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,555
You ready, three, two, one.

270
00:06:51,555 --> 00:06:53,493
- Okay, I love carrots.

271
00:06:53,493 --> 00:06:54,695
Carrots are awesome.

272
00:06:54,695 --> 00:06:57,164
- What if these actually taste like real carrots?

273
00:06:57,164 --> 00:06:58,174
- To tell you the truth,

274
00:06:58,174 --> 00:06:59,994
I can't really taste anything right now.

275
00:06:59,994 --> 00:07:00,827
- Luckily, I got the gummies.

276
00:07:00,827 --> 00:07:05,072
We can see if they actually taste like carrots.

277
00:07:05,072 --> 00:07:05,905
- That's weird.

278
00:07:05,905 --> 00:07:07,465
- They actually taste like carrots.

279
00:07:07,465 --> 00:07:08,298
- Really?

280
00:07:11,248 --> 00:07:12,081
- That's crazy.

281
00:07:12,081 --> 00:07:13,748
Why would you make a carrot-like tasting gummy?

282
00:07:13,748 --> 00:07:15,592
Alright, gonna pop 'em in.

283
00:07:15,592 --> 00:07:16,425
Oops.

284
00:07:16,425 --> 00:07:18,133
I'm a vampire.

285
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:18,966
- No.

286
00:07:18,966 --> 00:07:20,511
What, you're gonna like turn me into a carrot or something?

287
00:07:20,511 --> 00:07:24,511
(thunder roaring) - Muahahahaha.

288
00:07:26,052 --> 00:07:27,363
It tastes nasty as a carrot does.

289
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:29,385
My drink still looks actually kind of delicious.

290
00:07:29,385 --> 00:07:31,311
Yours, on the other hand, does not.

291
00:07:31,311 --> 00:07:32,287
And, this round was suggested

292
00:07:32,287 --> 00:07:33,854

00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:34,792

00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,366
down below, but again, congratulations,

296
00:07:38,366 --> 00:07:39,665
and let's find out what you suggested.

297
00:07:39,665 --> 00:07:41,998
Here we go, three, two, one.

298
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:44,513
- Hey, it's a hot dog.

299
00:07:44,513 --> 00:07:48,000
- I have never seen a gummy hot dog before.

300
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,833
(gasping)

301
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:49,808
Look at his buns (laughs).

302
00:07:49,808 --> 00:07:51,383
- That looks so awesome.

303
00:07:51,383 --> 00:07:52,455
- Like even the attention to detail.

304
00:07:52,455 --> 00:07:54,491
It's like the yellow mustard on the top of it,

305
00:07:54,491 --> 00:07:55,430
oh my gosh. - I know.

306
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:58,847
I'm ready. - Here we go, three, two, one.

307
00:08:01,835 --> 00:08:04,179
I think this may be one of, if not,

308
00:08:04,179 --> 00:08:08,277
the most tasty gummy I have ever tried in my entire life.

309
00:08:08,277 --> 00:08:09,149
You wanna try it right now?

310
00:08:09,149 --> 00:08:10,253
- Yeah, I actually really do.

311
00:08:10,253 --> 00:08:12,660
- Dude, this one is so good.

312
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,867
- Mm, wow.

313
00:08:13,867 --> 00:08:14,708
- Mhm.

314
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:15,541
- Wow.

315
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:16,729
- Oh, you bit it, now I have to put it in my drink.

316
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:18,267
Oh well, I guess we're brothers, so.

317
00:08:18,267 --> 00:08:19,568
(claps) yay.

318
00:08:19,568 --> 00:08:21,464
We forgot whose turn it is to switch or keep it,

319
00:08:21,464 --> 00:08:23,689
so I'm making the executive decision right now

320
00:08:23,689 --> 00:08:25,749
that Devan's gonna make the executive decision right now.

321
00:08:25,749 --> 00:08:26,654
Which one is it gonna be?

322
00:08:26,654 --> 00:08:27,487
- I-

323
00:08:27,487 --> 00:08:28,963
- Executive decision on my end, we keep 'em.

324
00:08:28,963 --> 00:08:29,796
- I'm cool with that.

325
00:08:29,796 --> 00:08:30,629
Alright, let's do it.

326
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:32,877
- Three, two, one.

327
00:08:32,877 --> 00:08:34,265
Yes, - Oh no.

328
00:08:34,265 --> 00:08:37,593
- That was the worst executive decision ever.

329
00:08:37,593 --> 00:08:40,647
- I am so not happy about this.

330
00:08:40,647 --> 00:08:42,170
- Never happened.

331
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:43,420
Never happened.

332
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:45,274
First try.

333
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:46,390
- Yeah, that was the first try, okay.

334
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,581
We're definitely not gonna leave you on the fail dim there.

335
00:08:48,581 --> 00:08:49,414
- Exactly.

336
00:08:49,414 --> 00:08:50,653
- I wonder if you could like pre-scramble an egg

337
00:08:50,653 --> 00:08:52,285
by doing this with it 'cause I have to drink this egg.

338
00:08:52,285 --> 00:08:53,118
- Don't crack it.

339
00:08:53,118 --> 00:08:54,938
- I'm gonna crack it into my mouth.

340
00:08:54,938 --> 00:08:56,067
Here we go, three, two, one.

341
00:08:56,067 --> 00:08:57,120
(cracking)

342
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,144
- Oh, it didn't work.

343
00:08:58,144 --> 00:08:58,977
- Oh, it's danglin'.

344
00:08:58,977 --> 00:08:59,879
- Your strategy didn't work.

345
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:00,722
- Ah.

346
00:09:00,722 --> 00:09:01,555
- Ah.

347
00:09:04,081 --> 00:09:04,914
- Ah.

348
00:09:06,043 --> 00:09:07,250
It couldn't have gone worse.

349
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,127
- That was so gross.

350
00:09:09,127 --> 00:09:11,006
- I almost like almost threw up, bro.

351
00:09:11,006 --> 00:09:12,847
Okay, put the egg, put the egg in there.

352
00:09:12,847 --> 00:09:13,680
- Alright.

353
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,084
Ugh, it's on my fingers now, ew.

354
00:09:16,084 --> 00:09:17,975
- This one here is looking a little bit suspicious, Devan.

355
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:18,966
- Hm (chuckles).

356
00:09:18,966 --> 00:09:20,900
- So, do you wanna keep it or switch it?

357
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,182
- I'm gonna take a risk, and actually keep it.

358
00:09:23,182 --> 00:09:24,015
- Alright, here we go.

359
00:09:24,015 --> 00:09:24,953
- I'm probably gonna regret this.

360
00:09:24,953 --> 00:09:26,929
- Three, two, one.

361
00:09:26,929 --> 00:09:28,332
- Hey, it's a watermelon.

362
00:09:28,332 --> 00:09:29,580
- Oh my gosh, the only thing better

363
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,458
than watermelon is a watermelon gummy,

364
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,358
and the only thing better than a watermelon gummy,

365
00:09:33,358 --> 00:09:35,356
is a water mehl-ohn on a stick.

366
00:09:35,356 --> 00:09:36,189
It's got like a little bit

367
00:09:36,189 --> 00:09:37,320
of a different kind of smell to it as well.

368
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,481
Ooh. - Oh, it does.

369
00:09:39,481 --> 00:09:42,155
Wait, take this thing out.

370
00:09:42,155 --> 00:09:44,051
(coughs) I choked on my watermelon.

371
00:09:44,051 --> 00:09:46,218
The stick won't come out.

372
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:48,051
- You must try harder.

373
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,410
- Hey, it came out, yay.

374
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:53,827
- No one eats the rind, yeht.

375
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:56,832
Where did it go?

376
00:09:56,832 --> 00:09:57,665
- (chuckles) it disappeared.

377
00:09:57,665 --> 00:09:59,408
- Oh, gonna pop my watermelon in here.

378
00:09:59,408 --> 00:10:01,553
- I'm hoping this adds a little bit of water

379
00:10:01,553 --> 00:10:04,818
to the base of the smoothie 'cause it's a really dry one.

380
00:10:04,818 --> 00:10:06,254
- So, we forgot again whose turn it is,

381
00:10:06,254 --> 00:10:08,024
so we're gonna do rock, paper, scissors to decide.

382
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,294
Rock, paper, scissor, shoot.

383
00:10:09,294 --> 00:10:10,559
Yeah. - No.

384
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,358
- And on that decision, I wanna keep it.

385
00:10:12,358 --> 00:10:14,855
Here we go, three, two, one.

386
00:10:14,855 --> 00:10:16,176
No. - No.

387
00:10:16,176 --> 00:10:18,162
- This isn't peeled, fam.

388
00:10:18,162 --> 00:10:19,230
My corn is super harry, bro.

389
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,835
My corn has never shaved in ages life.

390
00:10:20,835 --> 00:10:22,235
Look at how harry my corn is.

391
00:10:22,235 --> 00:10:23,571
- Dude, my corn is delicious.

392
00:10:23,571 --> 00:10:24,872
Oh, let's see what happens if you spin it,

393
00:10:24,872 --> 00:10:27,051
like one of those things where you like wind up and spin.

394
00:10:27,051 --> 00:10:28,381
- And, the hairs went everywhere.

395
00:10:28,381 --> 00:10:30,059
Wah-gah-wah-gah-wah-gah-wah-gah-wah-gah-wah-gah.

396
00:10:30,059 --> 00:10:31,842
What if you crack the corn in half?

397
00:10:31,842 --> 00:10:32,675
- Whoa.

398
00:10:32,675 --> 00:10:35,104
Wait, I want to try. - It juiced on me, bro.

399
00:10:35,104 --> 00:10:36,142
- No, not gonna happen.

400
00:10:36,142 --> 00:10:37,179
- Give it a good old chomp.

401
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:38,012
- Alright.

402
00:10:43,012 --> 00:10:45,344
Dude, it's not, it's literally just corn.

403
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:46,177
- And, it needs to be cooked.

404
00:10:46,177 --> 00:10:47,671
- Oh, yeah, I forgot about that.

405
00:10:47,671 --> 00:10:48,504
- Not a fan of that, okay.

406
00:10:48,504 --> 00:10:50,060
- Yeah, it should've been cooked.

407
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,091
Oh, I got it. - Ow.

408
00:10:51,091 --> 00:10:51,924
- I got a piece off.

409
00:10:51,924 --> 00:10:53,308
It's all stuck to my fingers.

410
00:10:53,308 --> 00:10:54,198
- Good lord.

411
00:10:54,198 --> 00:10:55,031
- It gave up.

412
00:10:55,031 --> 00:10:56,030
Oh.

413
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:56,863
- It's going in yours.

414
00:10:56,863 --> 00:10:57,696
- Wait, no, no, no, no.

415
00:10:57,696 --> 00:10:58,529
No. - Yes, it is.

416
00:10:58,529 --> 00:10:59,911
Dropped it in, it's going in.

417
00:10:59,911 --> 00:11:01,031
Last few rounds, let's go.

418
00:11:01,031 --> 00:11:02,096
No. - You got to put some hair

419
00:11:02,096 --> 00:11:03,033
in yours. - No.

420
00:11:03,033 --> 00:11:04,805
- Alright, are we switching it or keeping it?

421
00:11:04,805 --> 00:11:06,026
- Switching it right now.

422
00:11:06,026 --> 00:11:07,359
Three, two, one.

423
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:10,398
- Yes.

424
00:11:10,398 --> 00:11:11,853
Wait, so that's turkey

425
00:11:11,853 --> 00:11:13,392
and so, that must be- - This must be a turkey leg.

426
00:11:13,392 --> 00:11:14,225
- Yeah, I guess.

427
00:11:14,225 --> 00:11:15,058
Cheers?

428
00:11:15,058 --> 00:11:15,891
- Cheers.

429
00:11:15,891 --> 00:11:16,724
Yeah, bro, it's turkey.

430
00:11:16,724 --> 00:11:17,557
- Yup, it's gummy.

431
00:11:17,557 --> 00:11:18,821
- Alright, here we're gonna add it in.

432
00:11:18,821 --> 00:11:19,929
There we go full.

433
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,700
- You have no idea how hard that was.

434
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,055
- Boom, alright, final one, here we go.

435
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,152
For this final one, Devan,

436
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:27,972
do you wanna keep it or switch it?

437
00:11:27,972 --> 00:11:29,233
- I'm feeling good with keeping it.

438
00:11:29,233 --> 00:11:31,501
- But, to let you know, I'm getting great vibes from my end,

439
00:11:31,501 --> 00:11:32,938
so I'm very happy you're keeping it.

440
00:11:32,938 --> 00:11:33,771
- Really, you are?

441
00:11:33,771 --> 00:11:35,688
- Yup, three, two, one.

442
00:11:37,034 --> 00:11:38,298
- Yeah.

443
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:39,387
- You're kidding me.

444
00:11:39,387 --> 00:11:40,406
- Hey.

445
00:11:40,406 --> 00:11:41,239
Muah.

446
00:11:41,239 --> 00:11:42,896
- I can't.

447
00:11:42,896 --> 00:11:44,909
- Alright, let's sit down, cool.

448
00:11:44,909 --> 00:11:46,264
- I was gonna put the whole thing in, man,

449
00:11:46,264 --> 00:11:48,026
like just gotta, make sure you gotta eat

450
00:11:48,026 --> 00:11:49,382
your mustaches, kids.

451
00:11:49,382 --> 00:11:50,686
I'm gonna be eating those for like a week, man.

452
00:11:50,686 --> 00:11:52,509
Coming up right now, guys, about to top the top on,

453
00:11:52,509 --> 00:11:54,779
and then, we're about to blend them up, so let's do it.

454
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:56,118
What happened to my top?

455
00:11:56,118 --> 00:11:57,454
Wait, what do you mean what'd I do?

456
00:11:57,454 --> 00:11:58,493
Took the top, yeht.

457
00:11:58,493 --> 00:11:59,547
Oh, back over there. - Oh yeah.

458
00:11:59,547 --> 00:12:01,110
- Alright, gonna pop my top on.

459
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:01,943
- Alright.

460
00:12:01,943 --> 00:12:03,526
- Time to blend it.

461
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,312
Wait, what?

462
00:12:05,312 --> 00:12:06,317
- Is yours doing nothing?

463
00:12:06,317 --> 00:12:07,150
- Nothing.

464
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,344
- 'Cause mine's not doing anything.

465
00:12:08,344 --> 00:12:09,470
- I know what we're missing.

466
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,303
- I smell smoke.

467
00:12:10,303 --> 00:12:11,136
- Pickle juice.

468
00:12:11,136 --> 00:12:11,969
- Oh.

469
00:12:11,969 --> 00:12:13,497
- Oh, that looks really gross.

470
00:12:13,497 --> 00:12:14,330
- Oh.

471
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,595
- Oh my gosh, I'm not excited about this-

472
00:12:15,595 --> 00:12:16,498
- Oh, no, no, that's enough, that's enough.

473
00:12:16,498 --> 00:12:17,886
I'm just grabbing water for mine.

474
00:12:17,886 --> 00:12:19,721
There's no way I'm using that pickle juice.

475
00:12:19,721 --> 00:12:22,629
- Did I mention that I am ready 'cause I am ready.

476
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:25,408
Are you ready now, Devan?

477
00:12:25,408 --> 00:12:27,067
- Ooh, that's dripping everywhere.

478
00:12:27,067 --> 00:12:27,900
- You're dripping everywhere.

479
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,233
Three, two, one.

480
00:12:31,568 --> 00:12:32,401
Yeah, boy.

481
00:12:33,247 --> 00:12:34,582
Mine's going.

482
00:12:34,582 --> 00:12:35,415
- Mine's not.

483
00:12:35,415 --> 00:12:37,557
- Look at it go.

484
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:38,753
- Alright, I gotta shake mine.

485
00:12:38,753 --> 00:12:41,106
- Mine's a little blender who could.

486
00:12:41,106 --> 00:12:42,383
Oh my gosh, yeah, yours is like broken.

487
00:12:42,383 --> 00:12:44,068
Are you gonna like actually break it?

488
00:12:44,068 --> 00:12:46,105
Oh my gosh, mine's actually smoking out the back.

489
00:12:46,105 --> 00:12:47,213
Do you see the smoke coming out of mine?

490
00:12:47,213 --> 00:12:48,885
- I just did, and I can smell it.

491
00:12:48,885 --> 00:12:49,878
- Dude, coming from the bottom.

492
00:12:49,878 --> 00:12:51,018
- Bro, we got to open up a window.

493
00:12:51,018 --> 00:12:51,851
That smells.

494
00:12:51,851 --> 00:12:52,893
Alright, well, mine didn't do anything,

495
00:12:52,893 --> 00:12:55,445
so I got my spatula here, no wait,

496
00:12:55,445 --> 00:12:56,725
why are you doing it at the same time?

497
00:12:56,725 --> 00:12:58,363
All the sushi stuff.

498
00:12:58,363 --> 00:12:59,196
- Oh my gosh.

499
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:00,578
- Ew, I can hear it.

500
00:13:00,578 --> 00:13:01,973
And, there's a burger all the way at the bottom.

501
00:13:01,973 --> 00:13:03,627
- Oh, that's why it's not blending.

502
00:13:03,627 --> 00:13:06,298
- Yeah, alright, well, let's try this.

503
00:13:06,298 --> 00:13:07,802
- Hey, it's working.

504
00:13:07,802 --> 00:13:09,774
You gotta go deeper, bro.

505
00:13:09,774 --> 00:13:11,575
Oh, that smoke.

506
00:13:11,575 --> 00:13:12,408
Oh, there we go, there we go,

507
00:13:12,408 --> 00:13:14,551
it's working, it's working, it's working.

508
00:13:14,551 --> 00:13:16,939
Oh, no, this is so gross.

509
00:13:16,939 --> 00:13:17,910
- So nasty.

510
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:20,923
- But this is the gummy food versus real food smoothie.

511
00:13:20,923 --> 00:13:21,756
- Whose idea was this?

512
00:13:21,756 --> 00:13:24,590
- And, comment down below, what are some other random foods

513
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:27,043
you would love to see us make into a smoothie.

514
00:13:27,043 --> 00:13:27,876
Cheers?

515
00:13:27,876 --> 00:13:29,011
- Oh, my stomach is already churning.

516
00:13:29,011 --> 00:13:29,896
- Oh my gosh.

517
00:13:29,896 --> 00:13:30,729
Three.

518
00:13:30,729 --> 00:13:31,562
- Two.

519
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:32,405
- The little hair sticking out of it, bro.

520
00:13:32,405 --> 00:13:33,238
One.

521
00:13:40,587 --> 00:13:42,910
All I taste is the gross things.

522
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,077
None of the gummies.

523
00:13:44,077 --> 00:13:45,506
Where did all the gummies go?

524
00:13:45,506 --> 00:13:46,339
Who put them out?

525
00:13:46,339 --> 00:13:48,236
If you have any another video, click right over here.

526
00:13:48,236 --> 00:13:50,366
And also, I dare you right now, click right over here.

527
00:13:50,366 --> 00:13:51,708
Five seconds, just right over here.

00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:55,791
Five, four, three, two, click here, one, go, bye.

529
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,235
- Bye.

530
00:13:58,235 --> 00:13:59,429
- Like when you bite into a pickle, man,

531
00:13:59,429 --> 00:14:00,913
you want that crunch 'cause you want to know

532
00:14:00,913 --> 00:14:02,243
that it's fresh to depth.

533
00:14:02,243 --> 00:14:03,879
- What are you, some like pickle offician-ah-toh?
