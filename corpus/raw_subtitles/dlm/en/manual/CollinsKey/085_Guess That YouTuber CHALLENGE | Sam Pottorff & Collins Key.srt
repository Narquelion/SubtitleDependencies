1
00:00:00,144 --> 00:00:01,436
- What's up? It's Collins Key,

2
00:00:01,436 --> 00:00:03,270
and today I'm chillin' here with the one and only

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:04,530
Sam Pottorff.

4
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:05,875
- Hey, guys. - [Collins] Yeah.

5
00:00:05,875 --> 00:00:07,091
So today we got a challenge for you.

6
00:00:07,091 --> 00:00:09,814
We're going to be doing the Guess that Youtuber Challenge.

7
00:00:09,814 --> 00:00:11,972
We're goin' head-to-head, testing our knowledge right now.

8
00:00:11,972 --> 00:00:13,149
And basically, we're gonna be showin' a photo

9
00:00:13,149 --> 00:00:16,118
of a Youtuber's face, super zoomed-in on one part of it,

10
00:00:16,118 --> 00:00:18,354
and just off that part, we gotta guess who it is.

11
00:00:18,354 --> 00:00:20,392
Whoever can get it first, they win that round.

12
00:00:20,392 --> 00:00:23,316
Whoever wins the majority of those rounds,

13
00:00:23,316 --> 00:00:24,498
they get to tweet something off

14
00:00:24,498 --> 00:00:26,739
of the loser's Twitter account.

15
00:00:26,739 --> 00:00:28,006
- So we get to hack each other.

16
00:00:28,006 --> 00:00:29,222
- Yeah, it's gonna be crazy.

17
00:00:29,222 --> 00:00:30,771
And also, as this challenge is going,

18
00:00:30,771 --> 00:00:31,898
I want you guys, to like, follow along,

19
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:33,038
guess along with us,

20
00:00:33,038 --> 00:00:34,143
see if you guys can get 'em right.

21
00:00:34,143 --> 00:00:35,623
Give the video a thumbs up, if you guys are ready.

22
00:00:35,623 --> 00:00:36,760
And also, watch 'til the very end

23
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,593
to find out what the tweet is

24
00:00:38,593 --> 00:00:40,141
that the other person hacked off their account.

25
00:00:40,141 --> 00:00:41,240
First one, here we go.

26
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,274
Let's see what it is.

27
00:00:43,274 --> 00:00:44,107
Hayes?

28
00:00:45,918 --> 00:00:46,975
- Oh. - [Collins] Oh, I got it

29
00:00:46,975 --> 00:00:49,262
right off the bat, OK.

30
00:00:49,262 --> 00:00:50,358
- That was good, that was good.

31
00:00:50,358 --> 00:00:52,551
- I saw the eyes, and I'm like, hey, blue eyes squad.

32
00:00:52,551 --> 00:00:53,773
- Yeah. - [Collins] All right, cool.

33
00:00:53,773 --> 00:00:54,666
- Cameron Dallas.

34
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:56,537
- Oh, you're too quick.

35
00:00:56,537 --> 00:00:58,410
- Matt. - [Collins] Matthew Espinosa.

36
00:00:58,410 --> 00:00:59,631
Yeah, that's Matthew Espinosa.

37
00:00:59,631 --> 00:01:00,564
- Is that? - [Collins] Yeah, that has,

38
00:01:00,564 --> 00:01:01,461
Yeah. OK, cool.

39
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:02,761
- All right, you got that one.

40
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:04,434
- All right, let's see the next one.

41
00:01:04,434 --> 00:01:05,532
- Me. That's me.

42
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:08,501
- That's Sam? Is that you?

43
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:11,638
(chime) (laughing)

44
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:12,471
He got his own pic.

45
00:01:12,471 --> 00:01:13,906
I'm looking at it, I'm like, I actually don't know

46
00:01:13,906 --> 00:01:14,964
who that is.

47
00:01:14,964 --> 00:01:15,818
- Thanks.

48
00:01:15,818 --> 00:01:16,917
- Well, no, just off the eyes.

49
00:01:16,917 --> 00:01:18,425
- That is an old picture.

50
00:01:18,425 --> 00:01:20,333
- OK, yeah, with the hair and everything.

51
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:21,750
- I have no clue.

52
00:01:23,327 --> 00:01:24,275
- Is it?

53
00:01:24,275 --> 00:01:25,255
- Is that Julian Smith?

54
00:01:25,255 --> 00:01:26,311
(chime) - Ohh.

55
00:01:26,311 --> 00:01:27,326
- Yes.

56
00:01:27,326 --> 00:01:29,233
- Bro, legend right there.

57
00:01:29,233 --> 00:01:30,083
- Jenna Marbles.

58
00:01:30,083 --> 00:01:31,259
(chime) - Mmm.

59
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:32,885
- Ha. - [Collins] Ha.

60
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:33,718
- Uh. Huh?

61
00:01:36,544 --> 00:01:37,803
Janoskians.

62
00:01:37,803 --> 00:01:38,742
I still can't see.

63
00:01:38,742 --> 00:01:39,922
- Is it Janoskians?

64
00:01:39,922 --> 00:01:40,755
Yeah. - [Sam] Yeah.

65
00:01:40,755 --> 00:01:41,588
- Oh, my God.

66
00:01:41,588 --> 00:01:42,673
- I almost said One Direction.

67
00:01:42,673 --> 00:01:44,708
- Yeah, I thought it was, too.

68
00:01:44,708 --> 00:01:46,658
Caspar. Caspar Lee?

69
00:01:46,658 --> 00:01:47,555
Did I get it?

70
00:01:47,555 --> 00:01:48,745
- Dude, you're killin' it.

71
00:01:48,745 --> 00:01:50,912
Yeah, make it really hard.

72
00:01:51,932 --> 00:01:54,599
- Um, that is, there's a dimple.

73
00:01:57,872 --> 00:01:59,175
- I, honestly,

74
00:01:59,175 --> 00:02:00,435
(Jeopardy! Music)

75
00:02:00,435 --> 00:02:03,082
- Is that one of the Harris brothers?

76
00:02:03,082 --> 00:02:04,787
Is that Jack or Finn Harris? No?

77
00:02:04,787 --> 00:02:06,537
- I feel like it, um,

78
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:08,890
Is it one of the Dolan twins?

79
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:12,143
- It looks like there's a cheeky little smile goin' on.

80
00:02:12,143 --> 00:02:14,339
(laughing)

81
00:02:14,339 --> 00:02:15,360
- It has that little...

82
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,189
- Maybe look at it the other way.

83
00:02:17,189 --> 00:02:18,022
I don't know.

84
00:02:18,022 --> 00:02:19,474
- No, that's not helping.

85
00:02:19,474 --> 00:02:20,769
It looks like a different body part.

86
00:02:20,769 --> 00:02:22,029
(Collins laughing)

87
00:02:22,029 --> 00:02:23,170
- Is it Crawford?

88
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,687
- Crawford. You did it.

89
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,437
- All right.

90
00:02:27,437 --> 00:02:28,699
- I know. One of us were like...

91
00:02:28,699 --> 00:02:30,572
- So those first ones, they were, I wouldn't say, easy,

92
00:02:30,572 --> 00:02:31,667
but they were on the easier side.

93
00:02:31,667 --> 00:02:32,969
Now, for these next ones, they're gonna get

94
00:02:32,969 --> 00:02:34,552
way more difficult.

95
00:02:35,745 --> 00:02:36,642
- Jack and Jack.

96
00:02:36,642 --> 00:02:37,983
- No. Is it? (chime)

97
00:02:37,983 --> 00:02:39,081
Ah, missed it.

98
00:02:39,081 --> 00:02:39,914
Oh, 's OK.

99
00:02:41,801 --> 00:02:42,634
That's me.

100
00:02:42,634 --> 00:02:43,467
Yeah, OK.

101
00:02:44,405 --> 00:02:45,238
Kian?

102
00:02:46,153 --> 00:02:46,986
- Is it?

103
00:02:46,986 --> 00:02:48,474
Wow. - [Collins] Yes.

104
00:02:48,474 --> 00:02:49,307
- Wow.

105
00:02:49,307 --> 00:02:50,465
- I can't believe I got it, holy cow.

106
00:02:50,465 --> 00:02:51,481
- Wow, that's sad.

107
00:02:51,481 --> 00:02:53,435
- I'm sorry, bro.

108
00:02:53,435 --> 00:02:55,265
- Oh, my, wait,

109
00:02:55,265 --> 00:02:56,365
- Wait, wait, wait.

110
00:02:56,365 --> 00:02:57,586
What is it?

111
00:02:57,586 --> 00:03:00,232
- Fun for Louis. Louis Cole.

112
00:03:00,232 --> 00:03:01,065
(chime)

113
00:03:01,065 --> 00:03:01,898
Yes.

114
00:03:01,898 --> 00:03:04,255
- Whoa. Bro, I give you so much props.

115
00:03:04,255 --> 00:03:06,617
I had no idea on that one.

116
00:03:06,617 --> 00:03:08,121
I had no idea. - [Sam] I love him.

117
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:09,706
- He has glasses.

118
00:03:09,706 --> 00:03:11,624
- Gingerish eyebrows, right?

119
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:13,942
- Yeah, a little bit, or could be blond.

120
00:03:13,942 --> 00:03:14,775
- Ah.

121
00:03:14,775 --> 00:03:16,903
- There's really not a lot to go off.

122
00:03:16,903 --> 00:03:18,570
Is it, I don't know.

123
00:03:19,629 --> 00:03:20,689
- I don't want to guess wrong.

124
00:03:20,689 --> 00:03:21,522
That's why I'm like...

125
00:03:21,522 --> 00:03:22,801
- Yeah, no, me, too.

126
00:03:22,801 --> 00:03:23,634
- This is so bad.

127
00:03:23,634 --> 00:03:24,999
- I'm so stumped right now.

128
00:03:24,999 --> 00:03:26,788
You have any idea who it is?

129
00:03:26,788 --> 00:03:29,198
- I'm just going to guess, Tyler Oakley?

130
00:03:29,198 --> 00:03:30,800
(chime)

131
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,675
- Oh my gosh.

132
00:03:32,675 --> 00:03:34,139
We're gonna do a bonus round right now

133
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:35,405
and we're gonna guess that celebrity,

134
00:03:35,405 --> 00:03:37,569
just for fun, because we love you guys, so yeah.

135
00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:38,569
Let's do it.

136
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:44,156
You got a lot better at cropping these, I can say that.

137
00:03:44,156 --> 00:03:46,633
Just take a little bit of her eye in the photo.

138
00:03:46,633 --> 00:03:48,953
- The eyes look like they're going outwards.

139
00:03:48,953 --> 00:03:50,623
Is it the girl that was in American Ultra?

140
00:03:50,623 --> 00:03:51,456
- Yeah.

141
00:03:51,456 --> 00:03:52,612
- Kirsten...

142
00:03:52,612 --> 00:03:55,943
- Kristen Stewart, Kristen Stewart?

143
00:03:55,943 --> 00:03:57,532
I got it, I'm sorry I got it.

144
00:03:57,532 --> 00:03:58,968
We'll call it a half point for each on that one.

145
00:03:58,968 --> 00:03:59,823
- Oh, OK.

146
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:01,085
- Oh, Britney Spears. No, that's Britney Spears.

147
00:04:01,085 --> 00:04:01,941
- Britney Spears.

148
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:02,774
I always get...

149
00:04:02,774 --> 00:04:03,607
(chime) No, it's Britney Spears.

150
00:04:03,607 --> 00:04:04,440
- OK.

151
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,684
- I always get mixed up with their names.

152
00:04:06,684 --> 00:04:07,517
Is that Pedro?

153
00:04:07,517 --> 00:04:08,352
- Pedro.

154
00:04:08,352 --> 00:04:09,652
(laughing)

155
00:04:09,652 --> 00:04:10,548
- From, uh...

156
00:04:10,548 --> 00:04:11,605
- Oh, oh, David Blaine.

157
00:04:11,605 --> 00:04:13,029
Yeah, OK, gotcha.

158
00:04:13,029 --> 00:04:14,415
- Oh, my gosh.

159
00:04:14,415 --> 00:04:16,741
It looks like Pedro from Napoleon Dynamite.

160
00:04:16,741 --> 00:04:17,879
- Right.

161
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:18,815
Justin Bieber.

162
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,357
Yeah.

163
00:04:20,357 --> 00:04:21,660
Sorry, I saw the tats.

164
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,878
I was, like, it has to be.

165
00:04:22,878 --> 00:04:25,628
Jaden Smith? - [Sam] Jade Jeshjuh.

166
00:04:27,886 --> 00:04:29,086
5SOS.

167
00:04:29,086 --> 00:04:30,086
- Hmm, nice.

168
00:04:31,158 --> 00:04:32,168
Brown hair. - [Sam] Demi Lovato?

169
00:04:32,168 --> 00:04:33,001
Is that Demi?

170
00:04:33,001 --> 00:04:33,834
Is that Demi?

171
00:04:33,834 --> 00:04:34,710
(chime)

172
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:35,543
She looks so different.

173
00:04:35,543 --> 00:04:37,026
I shoulda known that one, I don't know what I was doin'.

174
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:38,122
Ooh, ah, Mr. T.

175
00:04:38,122 --> 00:04:38,955
Is that Mr. T?

176
00:04:38,955 --> 00:04:39,992
(buzzer)

177
00:04:39,992 --> 00:04:42,025
- Uh, whoo-joo-wa.

178
00:04:42,025 --> 00:04:44,503
- Exactly. Was that anyone huuk-so-howa?

179
00:04:44,503 --> 00:04:45,562
(laughing)

180
00:04:45,562 --> 00:04:47,063
- I know it's not, but Weeknd?

181
00:04:47,063 --> 00:04:47,998
(buzzer)

182
00:04:47,998 --> 00:04:49,542
- No, it's not The Weeknd.

183
00:04:49,542 --> 00:04:51,872
It's, is it Kanye?

184
00:04:51,872 --> 00:04:53,872

185
00:04:54,807 --> 00:04:55,703
Oh, my...

186
00:04:55,703 --> 00:04:57,441
- That was a good one.

187
00:04:57,441 --> 00:05:00,247
- I had no idea that was Kanye.

188
00:05:00,247 --> 00:05:01,505
- Wow.

189
00:05:01,505 --> 00:05:02,886
He had bigger lips than I thought.

190
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:03,719
All right, guys.

191
00:05:03,719 --> 00:05:05,044
So, obviously, Collins won the challenge.

192
00:05:05,044 --> 00:05:08,663
Now he gets to hack my Twitter and tweet off my Twitter.

193
00:05:08,663 --> 00:05:10,046
- I'll be posting in just a moment,

194
00:05:10,046 --> 00:05:11,184
but if you guys enjoyed this video,

195
00:05:11,184 --> 00:05:12,775
give a thumbs up right now,

196
00:05:12,775 --> 00:05:15,096
and also comment down below how many of them

197
00:05:15,096 --> 00:05:15,951
you got right,

198
00:05:15,951 --> 00:05:17,332
or which ones you thought were obvious,

199
00:05:17,332 --> 00:05:18,471
you got right off the bat.

200
00:05:18,471 --> 00:05:20,223
Make sure you guys check out Sam's video,

201
00:05:20,223 --> 00:05:22,135
who did a crazy Truth or Dare video on his channel,

202
00:05:22,135 --> 00:05:22,968
so the link,

203
00:05:22,968 --> 00:05:23,801
you can click his face.

204
00:05:23,801 --> 00:05:25,066
Be sure to follow Sam on all the social medias.

205
00:05:25,066 --> 00:05:27,020
Again, links are in all the description down below,

206
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,113
and without further ado,

207
00:05:28,113 --> 00:05:30,750
boom, there's the tweet.

208
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,000
Oh, it's crazy.

209
00:05:33,841 --> 00:05:34,927
And it's gone.

210
00:05:34,927 --> 00:05:36,433
All right, guys, I will see you again next week.

211
00:05:36,433 --> 00:05:37,660
Bye. (snapping fingers)
