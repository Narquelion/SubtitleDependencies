1
00:00:00,217 --> 00:00:01,681
- Three, two, one!

2
00:00:01,681 --> 00:00:03,016
- [Both] Ooh!

3
00:00:03,016 --> 00:00:04,878
- Oh my gosh! You challenged us to do

4
00:00:04,878 --> 00:00:06,342
the Mystery Wheel of Pancake Art

5
00:00:06,342 --> 00:00:09,343
and right now let's spin for the first pancake.

6
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:11,118
That was a solid spin. - Dude, that was a crazy spin!

7
00:00:11,118 --> 00:00:12,077
What do you think it's gonna land on Devan?

8
00:00:12,077 --> 00:00:13,893
- I'm gonna guess blue, I like blue.

9
00:00:13,893 --> 00:00:15,428
- I'm gonna say purple.

10
00:00:15,428 --> 00:00:16,261
- Purple?

11
00:00:16,261 --> 00:00:17,094
- [Both] Ooh!

12
00:00:17,094 --> 00:00:17,927
- I got it!

13
00:00:17,927 --> 00:00:18,760
- That is not fair!

14
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,608
Alright, let's see what the first one is.

15
00:00:20,608 --> 00:00:21,441
Bowser!

16
00:00:21,441 --> 00:00:22,274
- Oh sweet!

17
00:00:22,274 --> 00:00:23,604
- Let's kick it off right now with Bowser.

18
00:00:23,604 --> 00:00:25,112
Gonna get some awesome spikes on this dude.

19
00:00:25,112 --> 00:00:26,401
Bom! Bom! Bom!

20
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:29,529
Oh, its the up top drip drop drop drop.

21
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:30,362
To be good at this Devan, you really

22
00:00:30,362 --> 00:00:32,448
gotta get in touch with your inner Bowser.

23
00:00:32,448 --> 00:00:33,281
You know what I mean?

24
00:00:33,281 --> 00:00:34,903
Just like this!

25
00:00:34,903 --> 00:00:35,736
Bowser!

26
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:38,174
- Dude what? That's terrifying!

27
00:00:38,174 --> 00:00:39,081
- Bowser!

28
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:41,414
And then bo, bo, bo, Bowser!

29
00:00:42,618 --> 00:00:44,890
And then for the big one Devan,--

30
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:45,723
- No!

31
00:00:45,723 --> 00:00:48,304
(dramatic music)

32
00:00:48,304 --> 00:00:49,792
Dude, okay I think I have to let it go!

33
00:00:49,792 --> 00:00:50,625
- Bowser!

34
00:00:52,226 --> 00:00:53,346
- (laughing) Whoa!

35
00:00:53,346 --> 00:00:56,320
- [Both] Alright, I gotta get back to this pancake.

36
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,407
Did we just? (laughs)

37
00:00:57,407 --> 00:00:58,648
- I gotta finish up his shell.

38
00:00:58,648 --> 00:01:01,248
So just gonna fill this folly in with green right now.

39
00:01:01,248 --> 00:01:03,831
(upbeat music)

40
00:01:05,222 --> 00:01:06,570
And now, time to give him so jacked arms!

41
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:07,403
- Alright.

42
00:01:07,403 --> 00:01:08,236
Here we go.

43
00:01:08,236 --> 00:01:10,602
Give 'em one arm like this, look at that arm bro.

44
00:01:10,602 --> 00:01:11,435
(laughs)

45
00:01:11,435 --> 00:01:12,406
Oh no, what have I done?

46
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:13,950
- Oh no, mine's extra dripping!

47
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:14,942
It's double dripping!

48
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:15,775
Look at this!

49
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:16,608
- That's horrible!

50
00:01:16,608 --> 00:01:17,441
- What is going on?

51
00:01:17,441 --> 00:01:20,024
(upbeat music)

52
00:01:21,218 --> 00:01:22,060
- It's kind of squished, 'cause

53
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,434
I'm running out of room at the top here.

54
00:01:23,434 --> 00:01:27,397
It looks a giant shoe or a foot! (takes deep breath)

55
00:01:27,397 --> 00:01:29,502
- Lot's of deep breaths there.

56
00:01:29,502 --> 00:01:30,335
- This is not good.

57
00:01:30,335 --> 00:01:31,168
We'll give 'em little teeth.

58
00:01:31,168 --> 00:01:34,445
(upbeat music)

59
00:01:34,445 --> 00:01:36,029
- [Devan] And outline is done!

60
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:36,964
- Dude, that took you forever!

61
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:39,267
And I am not having it, and neither is my pet dini-saur!

62
00:01:39,267 --> 00:01:40,100
- The what?

63
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:40,933
- My pet dini-saur!

64
00:01:40,933 --> 00:01:41,766
- Can I pet him?

65
00:01:41,766 --> 00:01:43,223
- No! Do not pet the dini-saur Devan!

66
00:01:43,223 --> 00:01:44,056
- Why?

67
00:01:44,056 --> 00:01:45,232
- You know what happens when you pet a dini-saur, right?

68
00:01:45,232 --> 00:01:46,399
- No, I don't!

69
00:01:47,272 --> 00:01:48,560
- Alright, Devan you can pet the dini-saur!

70
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,393
- Okay.

71
00:01:49,393 --> 00:01:50,337
- [Both] Whoa!

72
00:01:50,337 --> 00:01:52,920
(loud roaring)

73
00:01:57,782 --> 00:01:58,615
- Dude!

74
00:01:58,615 --> 00:01:59,448
- Whoa!

75
00:01:59,448 --> 00:02:00,281
- Wow!

76
00:02:00,281 --> 00:02:01,114
- Okay!

77
00:02:01,114 --> 00:02:01,947
- I warned you!

78
00:02:01,947 --> 00:02:04,399
(upbeat music)

79
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,067
- Time to flip over my pancake right now!

80
00:02:06,067 --> 00:02:06,900
- [Devan] Nice!

81
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,184
- Here we go, I got a giant shovel scooper.

82
00:02:08,184 --> 00:02:09,699
This one's just gonna be a slight flick of the wrist.

83
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:11,773
Three, two, one, yeet!

84
00:02:11,773 --> 00:02:13,286
- [Both] Aw!

85
00:02:13,286 --> 00:02:14,619
- Oh, no, no no!

86
00:02:15,565 --> 00:02:16,398
Three, two, one.

87
00:02:16,398 --> 00:02:17,648
- [Both] Oh no!

88
00:02:19,037 --> 00:02:20,789
- You lost the head. Ta-da!

89
00:02:20,789 --> 00:02:22,764
- There we go, ta-da!

90
00:02:22,764 --> 00:02:25,457
A little more respect for Bowser man!

91
00:02:25,457 --> 00:02:27,247
- You just plopped that thang right down.

92
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:28,618
You didn't even treat it gently.

93
00:02:28,618 --> 00:02:30,460
- Do you see what I'm dealing with here?

94
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,622
- You literally had no care in the way you handled it.

95
00:02:32,622 --> 00:02:33,455
- I'm sorry, what?

96
00:02:33,455 --> 00:02:36,805
Can we just rewind back to your flip?

97
00:02:36,805 --> 00:02:37,851
See dude, look at that!

98
00:02:37,851 --> 00:02:39,622
And now it's time to flip mine!

99
00:02:39,622 --> 00:02:40,455
You ready for this?

100
00:02:40,455 --> 00:02:41,987
- [Collins] Dude, this reveal is gonna be crazy!

101
00:02:41,987 --> 00:02:45,155
- Alright, it is successfully on a spatula, three, two, --

102
00:02:45,155 --> 00:02:45,988
- Oh wait!

00:02:53,254 --> 00:02:54,858
- [Devan] Oh, what?

107
00:02:54,858 --> 00:02:56,461
- [Collins] Oh my gosh!

108
00:02:56,461 --> 00:02:57,677
- [Devan] That actually turned out pretty good.

109
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,491
- Dude, what?

110
00:02:59,491 --> 00:03:00,884
Well, there's Bowser from Super Smash Bros.

111
00:03:00,884 --> 00:03:03,053
and this is a battle and you get to comment down below

112
00:03:03,053 --> 00:03:04,588
and let us know who won this round.

113
00:03:04,588 --> 00:03:05,760
Time to spend for the next pancake.

114
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,593
Here we go, three --

115
00:03:06,593 --> 00:03:07,592
What was that? - What?

116
00:03:07,592 --> 00:03:08,475
- What do you mean?

117
00:03:08,475 --> 00:03:09,308
It was my turn.

118
00:03:09,308 --> 00:03:10,141
- I wanted to spin it.

119
00:03:10,141 --> 00:03:10,974
Alright, well it's on blue.

120
00:03:10,974 --> 00:03:12,130
Ooh, we got Wreck-It Ralph.

121
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:12,963
The thing about Wreck-It Ralph

122
00:03:12,963 --> 00:03:14,001
is it kind of looks like 8-bits,

123
00:03:14,001 --> 00:03:15,696
so luckily for me, this is right up my alley.

124
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,340
- Wait, when did you do 8-bit Collins?

125
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,685
- Because it's like more chunky and funky

126
00:03:19,685 --> 00:03:21,247
which is the way that I like to make my pancakes.

127
00:03:21,247 --> 00:03:22,913
Gotta make the inside of his mouth first.

128
00:03:22,913 --> 00:03:24,590
See, Devan always starts with these little small lines,

129
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,972
so I'm gonna try that this time

130
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:27,098
because I need to get better at this,

131
00:03:27,098 --> 00:03:29,472
so he goes like (sound effects).

132
00:03:29,472 --> 00:03:32,624
Oh no, the bottom stopped getting square and nice and cubey.

133
00:03:32,624 --> 00:03:33,707
- [Devan] Is that just his mouth?

134
00:03:33,707 --> 00:03:34,787
- (laughs) Yeah.

135
00:03:34,787 --> 00:03:36,087
You know what, see, it's all about squares.

136
00:03:36,087 --> 00:03:38,791
So I'm gonna do a little square tongue.

137
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:39,624
There we go.

138
00:03:39,624 --> 00:03:40,457
I think I'm crushing the game right now.

139
00:03:40,457 --> 00:03:42,136
See, oh, look at it.

140
00:03:42,136 --> 00:03:42,969
It's just, no.

141
00:03:42,969 --> 00:03:44,387
I'm gonna make eyeballs.

142
00:03:44,387 --> 00:03:45,888
Wait, you've done only a square?

143
00:03:45,888 --> 00:03:47,809
- It's the most crucial square though, Collins.

144
00:03:47,809 --> 00:03:48,875
It's the center.

145
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:49,944
- We got his eyeballs.

146
00:03:49,944 --> 00:03:51,054
So here we go, we're gonna get some side brows.

147
00:03:51,054 --> 00:03:52,081
Oh, there we go!

148
00:03:52,081 --> 00:03:53,248
Dude, the eyebrows are side brows.

149
00:03:53,248 --> 00:03:54,802
- [Devan] Where do you put those side brows?

150
00:03:54,802 --> 00:03:55,802
- [Collins] Off to the side.

151
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:58,100
- Next up, I'm going for the eyes.

152
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:58,933
- Fill these little babies in.

153
00:03:58,933 --> 00:03:59,885
- Fill these little babies in.

154
00:03:59,885 --> 00:04:01,679
- Alright, Wreck-It Ralph's gonna have some green eyebrows.

155
00:04:01,679 --> 00:04:04,926
(upbeat music)

156
00:04:04,926 --> 00:04:07,172
Just gotta put this last little touch right here --

157
00:04:07,172 --> 00:04:08,718
- [Both] Wait no!

158
00:04:08,718 --> 00:04:10,055
It's Hoot-Dini!

159
00:04:10,055 --> 00:04:10,888
- Who is that?

160
00:04:10,888 --> 00:04:12,569
- It's basically the owl that will randomly go off

161
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:14,653
each round, which means we have to spin for a wild card.

162
00:04:14,653 --> 00:04:15,486
- Alright.

163
00:04:15,486 --> 00:04:17,226
- Alright, bro I guess we gotta spin the mystery wheel

164
00:04:17,226 --> 00:04:18,429
to find out what our wild card is.

165
00:04:18,429 --> 00:04:20,010
Bro, I was goin' so well!

166
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,476
- [Both] Three, two, one.

167
00:04:21,476 --> 00:04:23,771
And this might mess-up your whole game right now.

168
00:04:23,771 --> 00:04:24,735
I got blue.

169
00:04:24,735 --> 00:04:25,681
- I got red.

170
00:04:25,681 --> 00:04:26,918
What? Hot sauce?

171
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:28,768
- That's not bad, do you know what mine is?

172
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,418
- For the rest of my pancake-making,

173
00:04:30,418 --> 00:04:32,735
I'm not allowed to use my hands.

174
00:04:32,735 --> 00:04:34,818
How do you make a pancake without using your hands?

175
00:04:34,818 --> 00:04:35,955
- This is gonna be so weird.

176
00:04:35,955 --> 00:04:38,136
I think I have to take out the cap of this,

177
00:04:38,136 --> 00:04:40,251
and combine the two 'cause there's no way

178
00:04:40,251 --> 00:04:41,889
just sriracha sauce is gonna work.

179
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:42,783
- (yells)

180
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,783
- Alright, here it goes.

181
00:04:45,796 --> 00:04:46,689
- I can use my shoulder though.

182
00:04:46,689 --> 00:04:47,820
Aw man!

183
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,847
It's so hard without my hands.

184
00:04:48,847 --> 00:04:49,848
- Okay, whoa!

185
00:04:49,848 --> 00:04:50,681
- Oh my gosh!

186
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:51,514
- Whoa!

187
00:04:51,514 --> 00:04:54,440
(upbeat music)

188
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,273
- [Devan] Oh, it's so gross!

189
00:04:55,273 --> 00:04:56,106
- [Collins] Oh, it looks pretty funky.

190
00:04:56,106 --> 00:04:56,939
Yo give me a spatula, dude!

191
00:04:56,939 --> 00:04:57,789
- What? Why?

192
00:04:57,789 --> 00:04:58,622
- The spatula, 'cause I need it.

193
00:04:58,622 --> 00:04:59,455
- Here you go.

194
00:04:59,455 --> 00:05:00,288
- Other way.

195
00:05:00,288 --> 00:05:01,656
- This way.

196
00:05:01,656 --> 00:05:03,378
- Dude, what are you doing?

197
00:05:03,378 --> 00:05:04,211
It fell over.

198
00:05:04,211 --> 00:05:06,031
- Oh no, it's not really comin' out now.

199
00:05:06,031 --> 00:05:08,816
(grunts in frustration)

200
00:05:08,816 --> 00:05:10,408
You weren't using your --

201
00:05:10,408 --> 00:05:11,586
Alright, my sriracha's added.

202
00:05:11,586 --> 00:05:13,349
That was super easy!

203
00:05:13,349 --> 00:05:14,501
- There's a spatula right there.

204
00:05:14,501 --> 00:05:15,524
- Yeah, see the thing is to get

205
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:16,757
that spatula, I need another spatula.

206
00:05:16,757 --> 00:05:17,924
- Here you go!

207
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,217
Nice, alright there you go.

208
00:05:20,217 --> 00:05:21,053
- I'm losin' it!

209
00:05:21,053 --> 00:05:21,886
- It's now time to --

210
00:05:21,886 --> 00:05:23,331
Whoa! - Ow!

211
00:05:23,331 --> 00:05:24,164
Do you have another spatula?

212
00:05:24,164 --> 00:05:24,997
- No. (laughs)

213
00:05:24,997 --> 00:05:25,830
- You know what, I'm over!

214
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:26,663
- You're over?

215
00:05:26,663 --> 00:05:27,529
Over what?

216
00:05:27,529 --> 00:05:28,868
- I'm goin' in for it bro!

217
00:05:28,868 --> 00:05:30,849
- Oh, whoa, wow!

218
00:05:30,849 --> 00:05:33,539
That's really skilled man!

219
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:35,046
- Dude, I think you can use your hands now.

220
00:05:35,046 --> 00:05:36,686
I just feel so bad for you --

221
00:05:36,686 --> 00:05:37,876
- See, here's the issue Devan.

222
00:05:37,876 --> 00:05:40,186
When you spin for no hands, it literally means no hands!

223
00:05:40,186 --> 00:05:41,051
- What?

224
00:05:41,051 --> 00:05:41,884
- I have no hands!

225
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:42,831
He took my hands away!

226
00:05:42,831 --> 00:05:44,430
- You had hands a second ago, what happened?

227
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,456
- Oh, I have an idea.

228
00:05:45,456 --> 00:05:46,316
I thought of a loophole.

229
00:05:46,316 --> 00:05:47,884
BOOM! Claws, bro!

230
00:05:47,884 --> 00:05:49,045
Alright, here we go so now I'm

231
00:05:49,045 --> 00:05:49,982
just gonna fill in his face, oh!

232
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:51,166
Why is it so watery?

233
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,414
This is great man, the no hands

234
00:05:52,414 --> 00:05:53,802
thing is all working out for me.

235
00:05:53,802 --> 00:05:56,454
Let's see, we're just gonna give him a whole mess of hair.

236
00:05:56,454 --> 00:05:57,287
And, done!

237
00:05:58,869 --> 00:06:00,686
So now, just gonna have to, uh-oh!

238
00:06:00,686 --> 00:06:01,540
That's not cooked!

239
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,600
- You're kind of encroaching into my space.

240
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,491
Your head's like resting on my arm!

241
00:06:05,491 --> 00:06:07,188
- Bro, that smells like sriracha sauce on your side.

242
00:06:07,188 --> 00:06:09,992
- [Both] Three, two, one.

243
00:06:09,992 --> 00:06:11,066
He just can't get the height, man!

244
00:06:11,066 --> 00:06:12,349
- There we go!

245
00:06:12,349 --> 00:06:14,323
- Whoa! Don't break it! Don't break it!

246
00:06:14,323 --> 00:06:15,906
Look it, it's done!

247
00:06:16,797 --> 00:06:17,922
- Where's the other spatula?

248
00:06:17,922 --> 00:06:19,443
- You want the ones that were in or out of my mouth?

249
00:06:19,443 --> 00:06:20,463
- (laughs) Not in your mouth.

250
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,518
The sriracha turned it so that the

251
00:06:22,518 --> 00:06:25,273
pancake batter split and doesn't actually cook.

252
00:06:25,273 --> 00:06:26,797
- Dude, and you're gonna have to actually eat that!

253
00:06:26,797 --> 00:06:29,235
At the end of the video, we'll be eating these pancakes bro!

254
00:06:29,235 --> 00:06:31,214
- Oh no! It's kinda breaking.

255
00:06:31,214 --> 00:06:32,927
Three, two, one --

256
00:06:32,927 --> 00:06:34,361
- We're in the first five seconds subscribe challenge!

257
00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:36,433
We wanna see if you can subscribe to this channel and

258
00:06:36,433 --> 00:06:39,330
turn on the channel post notifications in just five seconds.

259
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:40,380
Here we go!

260
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,963
- [Both] Five, four, three, two, one, done!

261
00:06:44,887 --> 00:06:45,864
If you can do that, comment down below

262
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:47,716
Keyper Squad right now!

263
00:06:47,716 --> 00:06:48,589
- [Both] Oh!

264
00:06:48,589 --> 00:06:50,141
It's so bad!

265
00:06:50,141 --> 00:06:51,982
At least my guy didn't lose his forehead.

266
00:06:51,982 --> 00:06:53,357
Right now, you get to comment down below

267
00:06:53,357 --> 00:06:54,811
and let us know who won this round.

268
00:06:54,811 --> 00:06:56,458
Time to spin for our next pancake.

269
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:57,483
Three, two, one.

270
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:59,535
What do you think it's gonna land on?

271
00:06:59,535 --> 00:07:00,368
- Green.

272
00:07:00,368 --> 00:07:01,618
- I'm gonna say yellow.

273
00:07:01,618 --> 00:07:02,451
- [Both] Oh!

274
00:07:02,451 --> 00:07:03,982
- Alright, well let's see what it is.

275
00:07:03,982 --> 00:07:04,815
Oh snap! Okay!

276
00:07:04,815 --> 00:07:05,648
- What?

277
00:07:05,648 --> 00:07:07,632
- It's the most famous detective in the entire world.

278
00:07:07,632 --> 00:07:08,465
- Sherlock Holmes?

279
00:07:08,465 --> 00:07:09,298
- No! Pikachu!

280
00:07:09,298 --> 00:07:10,131
- Oh, what?

281
00:07:10,131 --> 00:07:10,964
- Right now, let's make him.

282
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:12,200
Just gonna start off over here.

283
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,507
Ear number two's gonna be a lot smaller.

284
00:07:13,507 --> 00:07:15,113
I'm playing with perspective a little bit, you know?

285
00:07:15,113 --> 00:07:15,946
Ha-ha, art words.

286
00:07:15,946 --> 00:07:18,026
Pikachu's got his little head. (evil laughter)

287
00:07:18,026 --> 00:07:19,109
What is that?

288
00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:24,505
I've gotta build some static electricity, Pika-chu!

289
00:07:24,505 --> 00:07:26,160
Oh snap!

290
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,191
Oh my gosh!

291
00:07:27,191 --> 00:07:28,389
Wait, let me see if I can do it.

292
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:30,806
Let me see if I can just, ow!

293
00:07:32,693 --> 00:07:34,241
Bro, this is crazy!

294
00:07:34,241 --> 00:07:38,381
- [Both] (yelling in fear)

295
00:07:38,381 --> 00:07:39,214
- Okay.

296
00:07:39,214 --> 00:07:40,621
- Alright, enough of that.

297
00:07:40,621 --> 00:07:42,340
Let's keep making the tail.

298
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,197
Of course, detective Pikachu's got his hat.

299
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:45,263
What I'm gonna have to do, I'm gonna have

300
00:07:45,263 --> 00:07:46,823
to build a little stick on his head

301
00:07:46,823 --> 00:07:49,044
Because this little stick, is gonna support his hat.

302
00:07:49,044 --> 00:07:51,788
- It's like one of the propeller hats upside-down though.

303
00:07:51,788 --> 00:07:52,921
- We're getting little propellers.

304
00:07:52,921 --> 00:07:53,754
Nailed it!

305
00:07:53,754 --> 00:07:54,814
Here we go, so now we're gonna give

306
00:07:54,814 --> 00:07:55,647
him a little magnifying glass.

307
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,480
There we go.

308
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,372
A little lightening bolt coming out of his tail.

309
00:07:57,372 --> 00:07:58,997
See now I know why you use these little precision ones bro

310
00:07:58,997 --> 00:08:00,204
'cause it's actually a lot easier.

311
00:08:00,204 --> 00:08:02,141
- [Devan] And I made his ears super wide.

312
00:08:02,141 --> 00:08:03,816
- Now for the most important and skillful part.

313
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,724
Gotta start filling in his tail.

314
00:08:05,724 --> 00:08:06,640
Oh snap!

315
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,546
It's Hoot-Dini!

316
00:08:07,546 --> 00:08:08,379
- Seriously?

317
00:08:08,379 --> 00:08:09,589
Mine was going so good!

318
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:10,541
- Alright well I guess we gotta spin

319
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:12,671
the mystery wheels and let's hopefully get something good.

320
00:08:12,671 --> 00:08:14,363
- [Both] Three, two, one.

321
00:08:14,363 --> 00:08:15,239
- Man I can't believe it.

322
00:08:15,239 --> 00:08:16,072
- I got red.

323
00:08:16,072 --> 00:08:17,042
I don't have a good feeling about this.

324
00:08:17,042 --> 00:08:19,169
- What? I got a switch up, bro!

325
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:20,097
- Oh yes!

326
00:08:20,097 --> 00:08:21,328
We have to switch pancakes!

327
00:08:21,328 --> 00:08:22,307
- No! Seriously?

328
00:08:22,307 --> 00:08:23,140
- Oh yeah!

329
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,091
- It was going so good!

330
00:08:24,091 --> 00:08:24,925
- No!

331
00:08:24,925 --> 00:08:26,539
- What? Oh you got a blindfold?

332
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:27,818
- I have to be blind-folded!

333
00:08:27,818 --> 00:08:29,281
- (hysterical laughter) Okay so now what?

334
00:08:29,281 --> 00:08:30,698
- Pika-ah-ah-chu!

335
00:08:31,917 --> 00:08:32,750
- Wait, dude, what?

336
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,768
I teleported like two inches.

337
00:08:33,768 --> 00:08:35,065
- Yeah, but we did it with lightening.

338
00:08:35,065 --> 00:08:36,671
- Yeah, but we could've just switched trays.

339
00:08:36,671 --> 00:08:38,807
- Yeah but we couldn't do that with lightening.

340
00:08:38,807 --> 00:08:39,640
- Man!

341
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,473
- I got my blindfold on.

342
00:08:40,473 --> 00:08:41,946
- I'm gonna have to do a lot of reconstruction of yours.

343
00:08:41,946 --> 00:08:42,935
- I can't see anything.

344
00:08:42,935 --> 00:08:44,206
I have a system figured out for this.

345
00:08:44,206 --> 00:08:45,039
Put it down.

346
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:46,422
We'll go around until I find, oh, found something here,

347
00:08:46,422 --> 00:08:47,585
and then I'm just gonna dispense.

348
00:08:47,585 --> 00:08:48,851
One ear moved.

349
00:08:48,851 --> 00:08:50,189
I think this is his eye right here.

350
00:08:50,189 --> 00:08:51,022
You know what?

351
00:08:51,022 --> 00:08:51,855
I'm gonna just kinda guess.

352
00:08:51,855 --> 00:08:52,688
So there we go.

353
00:08:52,688 --> 00:08:53,521
We're gonna give him a little eye, perfect.

354
00:08:53,521 --> 00:08:54,647
There we go, give him a little nose.

355
00:08:54,647 --> 00:08:55,548
Devan, is this red?

356
00:08:55,548 --> 00:08:56,381
- [Devan] No! This is red.

357
00:08:56,381 --> 00:08:57,481
- Okay this is red, here we go.

358
00:08:57,481 --> 00:08:59,409
I'm gonna go 'til I hit the side of his head.

359
00:08:59,409 --> 00:09:00,442
Oh, okay something's here.

360
00:09:00,442 --> 00:09:01,771
Gonna give him a little cheek over here,

361
00:09:01,771 --> 00:09:03,264
and a little red cheek over here.

362
00:09:03,264 --> 00:09:04,320
Now this is the most important part,

363
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,446
'cause this is all just kind of a,

364
00:09:05,446 --> 00:09:06,584
I'm guessing right now but I gotta figure out

365
00:09:06,584 --> 00:09:08,114
which one is yellow so I can fill in his face.

366
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:09,910
I think this is yellow!

367
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:10,801
- It's not yellow!

368
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:12,038
This is yellow!

369
00:09:12,038 --> 00:09:12,871
- No!

370
00:09:12,871 --> 00:09:13,741
- Use your twin telepathy right now Devan.

371
00:09:13,741 --> 00:09:14,983
Send me the yellow!

372
00:09:14,983 --> 00:09:16,511
- Three, two, one.

373
00:09:16,511 --> 00:09:17,596
- [Both] Oh! Ow!

374
00:09:17,596 --> 00:09:18,429
- I got it!

375
00:09:18,429 --> 00:09:19,496
It is right, --

376
00:09:19,496 --> 00:09:20,605
- [Both] There!

377
00:09:20,605 --> 00:09:22,625
- [Devan] No, no there!

378
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:23,711
- Twin telepathy is so great!

379
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:25,236
Here we go, maybe a little bit on this side,

380
00:09:25,236 --> 00:09:27,048
and maybe a little bit more up here.

381
00:09:27,048 --> 00:09:28,222
- Wow!

382
00:09:28,222 --> 00:09:30,015
- Are you breaking, what are you doing to my pancake?

383
00:09:30,015 --> 00:09:31,166
Okay, I take a nap now.

384
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:33,749
(upbeat music)

385
00:09:34,769 --> 00:09:36,046
Alright, mine smells like it's perfectly

386
00:09:36,046 --> 00:09:37,357
cooked and ready to be flipped.

387
00:09:37,357 --> 00:09:38,668
- Collins, it's not even on.

388
00:09:38,668 --> 00:09:39,946
- Could you turn it on?

389
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:40,922
- Yeah, I could totally turn it on.

390
00:09:40,922 --> 00:09:42,054
- Okay, Devan I need a spatula.

391
00:09:42,054 --> 00:09:43,441
- Alright, here you go!

392
00:09:43,441 --> 00:09:45,971
- Okay, perfect and, (gasps) no way!

393
00:09:45,971 --> 00:09:47,482
You got me an extendable spatula?

394
00:09:47,482 --> 00:09:48,315
I'm tryna find it.

395
00:09:48,315 --> 00:09:50,357
- Careful of the top!

396
00:09:50,357 --> 00:09:51,190
- I got it!

397
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,061
- Yeah, you kind of got it.

398
00:09:52,061 --> 00:09:52,936
- Time for the flip.

399
00:09:52,936 --> 00:09:54,269
Three, two, one.

400
00:09:55,539 --> 00:09:56,372
(laughter)

401
00:09:56,372 --> 00:09:57,665
- It actually flipped!

402
00:09:57,665 --> 00:09:58,498
- Yes!

403
00:09:58,498 --> 00:09:59,816
- You missed the pan.

404
00:09:59,816 --> 00:10:01,299
- Oh, it worked!

405
00:10:01,299 --> 00:10:02,597
Oh my gosh!

406
00:10:02,597 --> 00:10:04,038
Pretty interesting!

407
00:10:04,038 --> 00:10:05,773
Let's flip it around like that.

408
00:10:05,773 --> 00:10:06,606
You know what bro?

409
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:07,439
I'm very disappointed.

410
00:10:07,439 --> 00:10:08,272
- Why?

411
00:10:08,272 --> 00:10:11,139
- It appears you have discarded the majority of my work.

412
00:10:11,139 --> 00:10:11,972
You ready for this?

413
00:10:11,972 --> 00:10:13,764
Three, two, one.

414
00:10:13,764 --> 00:10:14,597
- Pikachu!

415
00:10:14,597 --> 00:10:17,834
Oh my gosh! - Dude, it actually worked!

416
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:18,667
- Well done!

417
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:19,933
Alright, well those are the Pikachus!

418
00:10:19,933 --> 00:10:22,053
You get to comment down below who won this round!

419
00:10:22,053 --> 00:10:24,103
- Time to spend for the next pancake!

420
00:10:24,103 --> 00:10:25,136
- Alright I'm gonna put some Pam.

421
00:10:25,136 --> 00:10:26,876
- You're Pamming it already?

422
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,666
- Here we go, yellow!

423
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:29,769
Alright, I'll take it. - Let's see what it is.

424
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:30,602
- Bumble bee.

425
00:10:30,602 --> 00:10:31,513
- I'm great at doing bees!

426
00:10:31,513 --> 00:10:32,346
- I'm great at doing bees!

427
00:10:32,346 --> 00:10:33,179
- Oh, no, like the Transformer.

428
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:34,746
- Oh! I thought for once I had this.

429
00:10:34,746 --> 00:10:36,183
- I can't believe we got yellow.

430
00:10:36,183 --> 00:10:37,016
- Alright, well you know what?

431
00:10:37,016 --> 00:10:38,799
Time to make a Transformer.

432
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:39,993
They are all about the shapes.

433
00:10:39,993 --> 00:10:41,700
The issue is I make my pancakes huge.

434
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,597
There we go, we gotta get his whole eye, circular pupil.

435
00:10:44,597 --> 00:10:45,964
Here we go, this is working perfectly!

436
00:10:45,964 --> 00:10:46,832
Oh, look at that!

437
00:10:46,832 --> 00:10:47,888
Squiggly eye brows!

438
00:10:47,888 --> 00:10:48,832
Yeah, boi!

439
00:10:48,832 --> 00:10:49,856
And then we'll give him a little square,

440
00:10:49,856 --> 00:10:50,867
a red square tongue.

441
00:10:50,867 --> 00:10:52,112
(high-pitch sound)

442
00:10:52,112 --> 00:10:53,235
That's Bumbleebee right now.

443
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:56,389
(upbeat music)

444
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:57,329
Man these lines are gonna be coming

445
00:10:57,329 --> 00:10:59,707
all disconnected and everything, bro this is not good

446
00:10:59,707 --> 00:11:02,374
- Oh no! It's Hoot-Dini! - Wait, seriously?

447
00:11:02,374 --> 00:11:03,914
- [Both] Three, two, one.

448
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:05,934
- Alright, well let's see, oh snap, I got purple.

449
00:11:05,934 --> 00:11:06,832
No way!

450
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,190
I got no thumbs bro!

451
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:09,893
- Dude, I got a chopstick flip.

452
00:11:09,893 --> 00:11:10,734
- Oh my gosh!

453
00:11:10,734 --> 00:11:11,879
- So that could be really bad.

454
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,023
- I guess now we're just gonna tape 'em up?

455
00:11:14,023 --> 00:11:15,171
Well, hand number one is done!

456
00:11:15,171 --> 00:11:16,496
The one hand tape tear is not easy

457
00:11:16,496 --> 00:11:18,377
when you don't have a thumb!

458
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:19,934
(squeals)

459
00:11:19,934 --> 00:11:21,040
I think it's time to start filling it in.

460
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,394
We're gonna grab some yellow, double peace sign!

461
00:11:23,394 --> 00:11:25,364
Who needs thumbs when you have 8 fingers?

462
00:11:25,364 --> 00:11:26,485
Grab it! Grab it!

463
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:27,318
- I got it!

464
00:11:27,318 --> 00:11:28,205
- Not your chopsticks!

465
00:11:28,205 --> 00:11:29,589
- I'm sorry that's all I have in my hand.

466
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:32,525
- [Both] (screaming)

467
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,837
- Just pick it up, dude, get it up!

468
00:11:33,837 --> 00:11:34,730
- I don't have thumbs!

469
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,632
Ah! It's ruining everything! - Support it from the bottom!

470
00:11:36,632 --> 00:11:38,414
- No! It's totally ruined it!

471
00:11:38,414 --> 00:11:39,747
Devan, this is horrible bro.

472
00:11:39,747 --> 00:11:40,762
- [Devan] Move over an eye.

473
00:11:40,762 --> 00:11:42,008
- We're gonna get some over here.

474
00:11:42,008 --> 00:11:43,785
- Are you almost done?

475
00:11:43,785 --> 00:11:45,329
(screaming)

476
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:46,926
- It's overlapping the lines a bit, Collins.

477
00:11:46,926 --> 00:11:48,334
- Well I'm not perfect.

478
00:11:48,334 --> 00:11:50,922
(upbeat music)

479
00:11:50,922 --> 00:11:52,169
Alright, I got my spatulas and now

480
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:53,422
I gotta flip this one over a little bit.

481
00:11:53,422 --> 00:11:54,759
- At least you can use spatulas, bro.

482
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:56,532
Oh be careful, dude, be careful!

483
00:11:56,532 --> 00:11:59,776
- [Both] Three, two, one. Oh!

484
00:11:59,776 --> 00:12:00,642
- Alright, well there you go!

485
00:12:00,642 --> 00:12:01,475
I flipped it!

486
00:12:01,475 --> 00:12:02,308
- Cool, it's looking great.

487
00:12:02,308 --> 00:12:03,383
Now it's time for my flip, you ready for this?

488
00:12:03,383 --> 00:12:04,329
- I believe in you Devan.

489
00:12:04,329 --> 00:12:05,391
- [Both] Three, two, one. --

490
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,477
- We're at our three second Like challenge.

491
00:12:06,477 --> 00:12:09,044
We wanna see if you can like this video in three seconds.

492
00:12:09,044 --> 00:12:09,877
Are you ready?

493
00:12:09,877 --> 00:12:10,710
Here we go!

494
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:13,627
- [Both] Three, two, one, done! Oh!

495
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:15,692
- [Devan] What?

496
00:12:15,692 --> 00:12:17,957
- [Collins] Dude, that thing looks insane!

497
00:12:17,957 --> 00:12:18,790
- Dude, it turned out --

498
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:19,623
- [Collins] You get to comment down below

499
00:12:19,623 --> 00:12:20,975
who made a better Bumblebee!

500
00:12:20,975 --> 00:12:22,582
Time to spin the wheel for the next pancake.

501
00:12:22,582 --> 00:12:23,482
Three, two, one.

502
00:12:23,482 --> 00:12:24,982
- What did you do?

503
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:28,031
- Wait, it's gonna fly off Alright, there we go.

504
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,459
- Well, let's just go with it, alright?

505
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:30,292
- Alright, I got purple.

506
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:31,125
- Alright.

507
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:31,958
- Aye, we got Fortnite!

508
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:32,791
- Oh, sweet!

509
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:34,040
Wait, what should we make?

510
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:34,873
- What if we did the llama?

511
00:12:34,873 --> 00:12:35,761
- Oh, sweet, yeah I'm down.

512
00:12:35,761 --> 00:12:36,973
- Alright, llama from Fortnite, here we go.

513
00:12:36,973 --> 00:12:39,207
I'm gonna start off with the head of the llama first.

514
00:12:39,207 --> 00:12:40,577
The most important part.

515
00:12:40,577 --> 00:12:41,944
- We're gonna go here, there's an ear.

516
00:12:41,944 --> 00:12:42,966
- Whoa what is that?

517
00:12:42,966 --> 00:12:43,799
- That's his head.

518
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:45,165
And then the body of his llama-ness.

519
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:46,669
- I love his little legs they're like,

520
00:12:46,669 --> 00:12:48,949
- My llama is gonna have some saber tooth fangs.

521
00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:50,646
That way no one can loot this llama!

522
00:12:50,646 --> 00:12:51,827
- Wow Collins, I don't think I've

523
00:12:51,827 --> 00:12:54,264
ever seen you this quiet before.

524
00:12:54,264 --> 00:12:55,716
- This is what concentration looks like, Devan.

525
00:12:55,716 --> 00:12:56,924
You should try to learn something.

526
00:12:56,924 --> 00:12:58,240
- [Devan] It's very difficult for me though.

527
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,261
- [Collins] Are you actually making

528
00:12:59,261 --> 00:13:01,402
all the little individual confetti thingys?

529
00:13:01,402 --> 00:13:02,388
- I mean most of 'em.

530
00:13:02,388 --> 00:13:03,573
- We're gonna start filling mine in,

531
00:13:03,573 --> 00:13:04,651
but I have a different strategy than Devan.

532
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:06,310
Instead of just doing 'em all the same color,

533
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:08,252
I'm gonna randomly do them in all different colors

534
00:13:08,252 --> 00:13:09,822
to make mine a rainbow loot llama.

535
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:12,317
Whoa, that's so much detail!

536
00:13:12,317 --> 00:13:13,427
- I didn't have enough room to add

537
00:13:13,427 --> 00:13:15,178
the legs, so this will have to do.

538
00:13:15,178 --> 00:13:17,575
Now it's time to start roasting my pancake.

539
00:13:17,575 --> 00:13:18,959
Wait, why is it stuck?

540
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,375
- Victor the Laser Pony fixes all!

541
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:21,208
Alright, here we go!

542
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:22,867
- Whoa! What mode is he on?

543
00:13:22,867 --> 00:13:23,700
- Let me see.

544
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,917
He's just on disintegrate mode.

545
00:13:25,917 --> 00:13:27,924
- (laughs) That sounds too intense for this.

546
00:13:27,924 --> 00:13:28,982
- Don't worry, boom!

547
00:13:28,982 --> 00:13:29,858
Obliterate mode!

548
00:13:29,858 --> 00:13:30,711
- (laughs) No!

549
00:13:30,711 --> 00:13:31,544
- You don't want that?

550
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:32,377
- No, no we don't!

551
00:13:32,377 --> 00:13:33,423
- Completely world destruction mode!

552
00:13:33,423 --> 00:13:35,406
- No! How is he that powerful?

553
00:13:35,406 --> 00:13:38,152
- Dude, this is Victor the Laser Pony!

554
00:13:38,152 --> 00:13:39,544
- Can't you tone him down a little bit?

555
00:13:39,544 --> 00:13:40,886
(grunts)

556
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:43,069
- That one and then that one.

557
00:13:43,069 --> 00:13:44,815
Alright, now he's on lucid mode.

558
00:13:44,815 --> 00:13:47,257
Ready? Three, two, one.

559
00:13:47,257 --> 00:13:50,389
Oh my gosh, Victor the Laser Pony, you're fighting back.

560
00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:51,673
Bro, he's tryna turn it up!

561
00:13:51,673 --> 00:13:53,756
Turn it down, down, down!

562
00:13:56,078 --> 00:13:56,911
Oh snap!

563
00:13:56,911 --> 00:13:59,100
Man, Victor the Laser Pony, you did a great job!

564
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,535
And you loosened some light bulbs as well

565
00:14:00,535 --> 00:14:01,768
but thank you for your service, Devan -

566
00:14:01,768 --> 00:14:02,601
- Thank you.

567
00:14:02,601 --> 00:14:03,434
- Touch Victor the Laser Pony.

568
00:14:03,434 --> 00:14:04,267
No! It was a test!

569
00:14:04,267 --> 00:14:05,373
You can not disrespect Victor the

570
00:14:05,373 --> 00:14:06,640
Laser Pony by touching his snout!

571
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,473
- Okay.

572
00:14:07,473 --> 00:14:09,105
Whoa! What? - I think it worked bro!

573
00:14:09,105 --> 00:14:10,348
I feel like if this goes wrong,

574
00:14:10,348 --> 00:14:12,346
it should go very wrong 'cause it's so much detail.

575
00:14:12,346 --> 00:14:14,929
(upbeat music)

576
00:14:17,157 --> 00:14:18,888
- Alright, it is time for the flip of my pancake.

577
00:14:18,888 --> 00:14:20,221
Three, two, one.

578
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,170
Oh! He lost his head.

579
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,694
This is probably my best pancake I've ever made.

580
00:14:25,694 --> 00:14:27,569
- Alright, it's time to flip mine, here we go!

581
00:14:27,569 --> 00:14:28,922
- If you break it, you will automatically lose

582
00:14:28,922 --> 00:14:30,152
'cause you're probably gonna lose anyway

583
00:14:30,152 --> 00:14:31,181
'cause you don't have four legs!

584
00:14:31,181 --> 00:14:32,379
Dude, this is so much pressure!

585
00:14:32,379 --> 00:14:33,483
- Three, two, one --

586
00:14:33,483 --> 00:14:35,330
- Wait, if you wanna win a 15 minute video call,

587
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:39,859
with Devan and I, text the word PANCAKE to 81800 right now!

588
00:14:39,859 --> 00:14:42,900
So pause the video, text the word PANCAKE to 81800,

589
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,095
you will automatically be entered in to win

590
00:14:44,095 --> 00:14:46,707
and right now let's see how this thing looks!

591
00:14:46,707 --> 00:14:47,540
- [Both] Oh!

592
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,742
- I did it, I did it!

593
00:14:48,742 --> 00:14:50,159
- That looks so good though!

594
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:50,992
- [Collins] You get to comment

595
00:14:50,992 --> 00:14:52,454
down below who made a better Fortnite llama.

596
00:14:52,454 --> 00:14:54,056
- Time to spin for our next pancake.

597
00:14:54,056 --> 00:14:55,079
- Aye, I got it!

598
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:56,199
- What do you think it's gonna be Collins?

599
00:14:56,199 --> 00:14:58,451
- I think it's going to be, I don't know purple?

600
00:14:58,451 --> 00:15:00,280
Oh! - Oh, so close!

601
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,438
Oh, Aquaman!

602
00:15:01,438 --> 00:15:02,396
- We're gonna start off with his trident

603
00:15:02,396 --> 00:15:03,841
because I'm feeling pretty bold right now.

604
00:15:03,841 --> 00:15:04,875
- You may have noticed that I flipped

605
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:08,114
my hot plate vertically and that is because Aquaman is tall.

606
00:15:08,114 --> 00:15:08,947
What are you doing?

607
00:15:08,947 --> 00:15:09,780
- I'm making his trident and then

608
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,085
we're gonna have to give him a little arm.

609
00:15:11,085 --> 00:15:12,202
- Alright, here we go.

610
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:14,156
- Man! I always run out of room really quickly.

611
00:15:14,156 --> 00:15:15,238
So this'll be his little head --

612
00:15:15,238 --> 00:15:16,071
- Oh my goodness.

613
00:15:16,071 --> 00:15:17,037
You have no idea how hard it is

614
00:15:17,037 --> 00:15:18,629
to do a straight line with this thing.

615
00:15:18,629 --> 00:15:20,161
- He's got some awesome, beautiful yellow hair.

616
00:15:20,161 --> 00:15:21,461
We'll give a little yellow belt.

617
00:15:21,461 --> 00:15:22,308
He's like meh.

618
00:15:22,308 --> 00:15:25,601
(upbeat music)

619
00:15:25,601 --> 00:15:26,542
- [Devan] Oh no!

620
00:15:26,542 --> 00:15:28,748
I'm losing my eyes!

621
00:15:28,748 --> 00:15:29,581
- That's not good bro!

622
00:15:29,581 --> 00:15:31,891
- Aw man, his face is gonna be all whack now.

623
00:15:31,891 --> 00:15:33,239
- I'm gonna start filling in my shark.

624
00:15:33,239 --> 00:15:35,672
This actually kinda reminds me of Sharkeisha a little bit,

625
00:15:35,672 --> 00:15:36,990
Sharkeisha, where are you?

626
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:38,723
Sharkeisha, where is Sharkeisha at?

627
00:15:38,723 --> 00:15:39,840
I know how to get her here.

628
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,290
Sharkerisha, I have your favorite rice cakes!

629
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:43,706
(screaming)

630
00:15:43,706 --> 00:15:45,836
- Sharkeisha no, I need to work on my pancakes!

631
00:15:45,836 --> 00:15:47,363
- Well let me at least give Sharkeisha some rice cakes!

632
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:48,768
It's time to flip my Sharkeisha.

633
00:15:48,768 --> 00:15:50,875
Oh no, Sharkeisha lost a tooth!

634
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,252
- [Both] Three, two, one. Oh!

635
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:54,116
- I lost a fin!

636
00:15:54,116 --> 00:15:55,865
Now it's time to flip Aquaman, uh-oh.

637
00:15:55,865 --> 00:15:56,698
His arms are very fragile.

638
00:15:56,698 --> 00:15:57,531
Give me a spatula please.

639
00:15:57,531 --> 00:15:58,364
- Okay, okay.

640
00:15:58,364 --> 00:15:59,197
- Gotta get his trident over here.

641
00:15:59,197 --> 00:16:00,865
- [Devan] Aw, lost some of this hair.

642
00:16:00,865 --> 00:16:02,280
- Three, two, one.

643
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,803
- [Both] Ah!

644
00:16:03,803 --> 00:16:05,247
- I totally broke my Aquaman!

645
00:16:05,247 --> 00:16:06,443
- [Devan] In pieces man!

646
00:16:06,443 --> 00:16:08,353
- Sometimes when Aquaman falls down,

647
00:16:08,353 --> 00:16:10,470
you just gotta figure out what goes where.

648
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,303
Aquaman!

649
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,136
- Alright!

650
00:16:12,136 --> 00:16:12,969
(creepy laughing)

651
00:16:12,969 --> 00:16:13,802
- Alright, time to flip mine.

652
00:16:13,802 --> 00:16:14,635
Are you ready for this?

653
00:16:14,635 --> 00:16:16,245
- Bro, this looks so crazy!

654
00:16:16,245 --> 00:16:17,078
- Here we go!

655
00:16:17,078 --> 00:16:18,770
Three, two, one!

656
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:21,087
- It flipped! Oh my gosh!

657
00:16:21,087 --> 00:16:23,700
- You get to comment down below who won this round.

658
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,283
We'll be eating these at the end of the video.

659
00:16:25,283 --> 00:16:26,116
Time to spend the wheel!

660
00:16:26,116 --> 00:16:27,278
- [Both] Three, two, one.

661
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:28,869
- What is it gonna land on?

662
00:16:28,869 --> 00:16:30,326
- Green, that's my safe bet.

663
00:16:30,326 --> 00:16:32,738
- I'm gonna go red.

664
00:16:32,738 --> 00:16:33,612
- [Both] Oh!

665
00:16:33,612 --> 00:16:34,445
Yes! - What? No way!

666
00:16:34,445 --> 00:16:35,494
- Alright, let's see what we got.

667
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,899
Yo, we have to make the Avengers!

668
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:38,083
- All of the Avengers?

669
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,700
- Okay fine, how about we pick one Avenger each

670
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,839
and then make that as a pancake?

671
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:41,672
- Alright, that sounds good.

672
00:16:41,672 --> 00:16:42,505
- Starting off with the outlines.

673
00:16:42,505 --> 00:16:44,322
You have to guess what superhero I'm making.

674
00:16:44,322 --> 00:16:46,279
It always ends up looking so much cooler in my head.

675
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:47,112
(screams)

676
00:16:47,112 --> 00:16:48,834
So much delicate work goes into this.

677
00:16:48,834 --> 00:16:49,667
Ooh, this is tough!

678
00:16:49,667 --> 00:16:50,943
It looks more like a waffle than a pancake.

679
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,943
- Yeah, you're making a waffle cake.

680
00:16:54,836 --> 00:16:55,669
- Check this out, you ready?

681
00:16:55,669 --> 00:16:57,544
Three, two, one.

682
00:16:57,544 --> 00:16:58,895
- Oh we gotta clean that off.

683
00:16:58,895 --> 00:17:00,145
Check this out.

684
00:17:02,914 --> 00:17:03,747
I got it!

685
00:17:03,747 --> 00:17:04,580
- Whoa!

686
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:05,445
- Yes, I got my rice cakes!

687
00:17:05,445 --> 00:17:06,601
- Are you done?

688
00:17:06,601 --> 00:17:07,557
- You know what?

689
00:17:07,557 --> 00:17:08,390
I gotta save it for later.

690
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:10,826
I'm gonna stick it to the ceiling, here we go.

691
00:17:10,826 --> 00:17:11,659
Got it!

692
00:17:11,659 --> 00:17:12,626
So now let's keep making this thing.

693
00:17:12,626 --> 00:17:13,459
- Wow.

694
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:14,292
- And now, it's time to create

695
00:17:14,292 --> 00:17:16,267
some building in the background.

696
00:17:16,267 --> 00:17:17,576
And he just shot a web at it.

697
00:17:17,576 --> 00:17:19,614
Why (laughs) does it look even more like a waffle?

698
00:17:19,614 --> 00:17:20,447
You know what I'm gonna do?

699
00:17:20,447 --> 00:17:21,460
I'm gonna make spider webs.

700
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,254
He's built himself a nice web in the background.

701
00:17:23,254 --> 00:17:24,484
Web number two, man it looks like

702
00:17:24,484 --> 00:17:25,541
he's in the middle of a heatwave.

703
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:27,249
(upbeat music)

704
00:17:27,249 --> 00:17:28,568
I mean this building really did not turn out -

705
00:17:28,568 --> 00:17:31,218
Oh my gosh! - No, seriously?

706
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:32,455
- It's Hoot-Dini again!

707
00:17:32,455 --> 00:17:34,305
So I guess we gotta re-spin the wheel bro.

708
00:17:34,305 --> 00:17:36,378
This thing just randomly goes off at the worst times.

709
00:17:36,378 --> 00:17:37,709
Alright, here we go, your ready?

710
00:17:37,709 --> 00:17:38,542
Wild card.

711
00:17:38,542 --> 00:17:40,321
- [Both] Three, two, one.

712
00:17:40,321 --> 00:17:41,154
- I hope I get a good one.

713
00:17:41,154 --> 00:17:42,337
I hope I don't get a bad wild card.

714
00:17:42,337 --> 00:17:43,170
- Blue.

715
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,003
- I got yellow.

716
00:17:44,003 --> 00:17:44,836
- Oh, it was so close to blue!

717
00:17:44,836 --> 00:17:45,669
- Oh no!

718
00:17:45,669 --> 00:17:47,184
- It's in the middle, I don't know what to do.

719
00:17:47,184 --> 00:17:48,177
- Re-spin it.

720
00:17:48,177 --> 00:17:49,010
- Alright, what did you get?

721
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:50,441
- I have to use my left hand!

722
00:17:50,441 --> 00:17:51,274
- You what?

723
00:17:51,274 --> 00:17:52,514
- And I am very much not left-handed

724
00:17:52,514 --> 00:17:53,883
and there's a lot of details to be done.

725
00:17:53,883 --> 00:17:55,370
- Oh, I hope it's a good one!

726
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:57,040
What? Kaleidoscope glasses?

727
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:57,873
What are those?

728
00:17:57,873 --> 00:18:00,002
Whoa! It's like seeing quadruple, bro.

729
00:18:00,002 --> 00:18:03,955
Like, my pancake's here, here, and here at the same time.

730
00:18:03,955 --> 00:18:05,311
I'm not looking forward to this!

731
00:18:05,311 --> 00:18:06,515
- You're not looking forward actually at all.

732
00:18:06,515 --> 00:18:07,348
- I'm not?

733
00:18:07,348 --> 00:18:08,181
Oh. I'm looking forward to this!

734
00:18:08,181 --> 00:18:09,014
- You're not looking forward at all.

735
00:18:09,014 --> 00:18:09,847
- I'm not?

736
00:18:09,847 --> 00:18:11,036
I need some blue!

737
00:18:11,036 --> 00:18:11,869
I got it!

738
00:18:11,869 --> 00:18:13,942
Wait, is this blue?

739
00:18:13,942 --> 00:18:14,775
Is this blue?

740
00:18:14,775 --> 00:18:15,637
- No, that's purple.

741
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:16,470
- It's purple?

742
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,303
- Yeah!

743
00:18:17,303 --> 00:18:18,136
- I got it!

744
00:18:18,136 --> 00:18:21,113
It is time to add the blue of the eyes, here we go.

745
00:18:21,113 --> 00:18:22,401
Oh, I actually nailed it!

746
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:23,234
Okay!

747
00:18:23,234 --> 00:18:25,252
- Alright, let's do this left-handed.

748
00:18:25,252 --> 00:18:26,156
This makes it harder.

749
00:18:26,156 --> 00:18:27,016
I don't even know what I'm doing.

750
00:18:27,016 --> 00:18:28,083
- Oh, I got it!

751
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:28,916
I got it!

752
00:18:30,205 --> 00:18:31,320
Yep, right there!

753
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,153
I think I got it.

754
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:33,213
- Okay, even with the kaleidoscope things,

755
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:34,586
how are you still so good at this?

756
00:18:34,586 --> 00:18:37,633
- Okay, hopefully this don't mess it up.

757
00:18:37,633 --> 00:18:39,110
(upbeat music)

758
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:40,167
Red! Ha-ha!

759
00:18:40,167 --> 00:18:41,000
This is red!

760
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,833
- That is red, yes.

761
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:42,666
Great job!

762
00:18:43,826 --> 00:18:44,707
I think it's done.

763
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:46,085
Do I have to flip it like this?

764
00:18:46,085 --> 00:18:47,356
- Yes! With the glasses on!

765
00:18:47,356 --> 00:18:48,189
- Really?

766
00:18:48,189 --> 00:18:49,543
- It's time for the flip and I can only use my left hand.

767
00:18:49,543 --> 00:18:50,913
Oh, I got his head!

768
00:18:50,913 --> 00:18:51,746
- You need help?

769
00:18:51,746 --> 00:18:52,579
- Yeah!

770
00:18:52,579 --> 00:18:53,412
- See, I can help you.

771
00:18:53,412 --> 00:18:54,796
Just give me a spatula.

772
00:18:54,796 --> 00:18:55,649
Got it right?

773
00:18:55,649 --> 00:18:57,107
- No, Devan if you don't feel it, you don't have it.

774
00:18:57,107 --> 00:18:58,340
- There! - There you go!

775
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,195
Teamwork makes the dream work.

776
00:18:59,195 --> 00:19:00,028
Left-hands, you ready?

777
00:19:00,028 --> 00:19:01,468
Go, go, go!

778
00:19:01,468 --> 00:19:02,301
Yes!

779
00:19:02,301 --> 00:19:03,598
Look, he's caught in his own webs!

780
00:19:03,598 --> 00:19:04,431
- Here we go!

781
00:19:04,431 --> 00:19:05,815
Three, two, one!

782
00:19:05,815 --> 00:19:07,715
- Oh that looks so good!

783
00:19:07,715 --> 00:19:08,783
- Does it look good?

784
00:19:08,783 --> 00:19:09,717
I can't really see it.

785
00:19:09,717 --> 00:19:11,695
- Comment down below who won this round.

786
00:19:11,695 --> 00:19:13,282
We'll be eating these at the end of the video.

787
00:19:13,282 --> 00:19:14,956
- Time to spin for our next pancake.

788
00:19:14,956 --> 00:19:15,819
What do you think it's gonna be?

789
00:19:15,819 --> 00:19:16,732
- I'm gonna say green.

790
00:19:16,732 --> 00:19:19,004
- I'm gonna go for blue.

791
00:19:19,004 --> 00:19:20,268
- [Both] Oh, we were both wrong!

792
00:19:20,268 --> 00:19:21,430
- Alright, well let's see what we got.

793
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:22,567
Oh, this one's poppin!

794
00:19:22,567 --> 00:19:23,513
- Mary Poppins!

795
00:19:23,513 --> 00:19:24,346
- How'd you know that?

796
00:19:24,346 --> 00:19:25,179
- 'Cause I looked at it.

797
00:19:25,179 --> 00:19:26,470
- Let's get some umbrellas and float away,

798
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:27,613
- Alright, umbrella done!

799
00:19:27,613 --> 00:19:28,446
That was easy.

800
00:19:28,446 --> 00:19:29,413
- You got lines going through it,

801
00:19:29,413 --> 00:19:30,246
because umbrellas have lines.

802
00:19:30,246 --> 00:19:33,001
This is like what happens when you have no vision for it.

803
00:19:33,001 --> 00:19:34,273
'Cause this was suppose to be here arm.

804
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:35,106
You know what?

805
00:19:35,106 --> 00:19:36,197
She'll have a giant triangle arm.

806
00:19:36,197 --> 00:19:37,813
- [Devan] Aw man, she has a teeny little arm.

807
00:19:37,813 --> 00:19:39,101
(laughs)

808
00:19:39,101 --> 00:19:41,184
- How am I so bad at this?

809
00:19:41,184 --> 00:19:42,455
Looks more like the Pillsbury Dough Boy

810
00:19:42,455 --> 00:19:44,044
than it does Mary Poppins.

811
00:19:44,044 --> 00:19:45,647
I don't think I'm doing the dress the right color right now.

812
00:19:45,647 --> 00:19:47,447
Oh no, it's Hoot-Dini!

813
00:19:47,447 --> 00:19:49,589
Oh snap, if I was in a bad place,

814
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:51,641
it's about to become even worse right now.

815
00:19:51,641 --> 00:19:53,724
- [Both] Three, two, one.

816
00:19:55,011 --> 00:19:56,907
- Oh, I got red, that can't be good!

817
00:19:56,907 --> 00:19:58,369
- What? Batter hands?

818
00:19:58,369 --> 00:19:59,768
- I got tentacle fingers.

819
00:19:59,768 --> 00:20:01,736
- Oh, so you have to like dip your hands in batter!

820
00:20:01,736 --> 00:20:02,569
- No!

821
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:03,467
- That's gonna drip all over,

822
00:20:03,467 --> 00:20:04,331
That's gonna ruin it!

823
00:20:04,331 --> 00:20:07,081
This is gonna be impossible, bro!

824
00:20:08,236 --> 00:20:09,069
Oh boy!

825
00:20:09,069 --> 00:20:09,902
- Oh man!

826
00:20:09,902 --> 00:20:11,091
- Alright, time to pick up some pancake batter.

827
00:20:11,091 --> 00:20:12,128
So let's see, just gonna --

828
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:12,961
- Oh no, you know what?

829
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:13,794
I'm just going for it.

830
00:20:13,794 --> 00:20:17,540
Add her dress, the longer I stay here, the worse it gets.

831
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,306
- Let's see if I can just start getting the tentacles --

832
00:20:19,306 --> 00:20:21,570
- Gotta add some more cityscape --

833
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:22,936
- How is it that 10 tentacles can't

834
00:20:22,936 --> 00:20:24,272
even pick up one of these things?

835
00:20:24,272 --> 00:20:25,716
Yes! No!

836
00:20:25,716 --> 00:20:28,717
(upbeat music)

837
00:20:28,717 --> 00:20:29,832
- [Devan] Now for the dark blue!

838
00:20:29,832 --> 00:20:30,723
Alright, and done!

839
00:20:30,723 --> 00:20:31,556
- These tentacle fingers are the

840
00:20:31,556 --> 00:20:32,491
worst things that's ever happened!

841
00:20:32,491 --> 00:20:33,427
She is gonna have a green body.

842
00:20:33,427 --> 00:20:35,242
See, it all goes so great until

843
00:20:35,242 --> 00:20:37,045
Hoot-Dini interferes with our game.

844
00:20:37,045 --> 00:20:37,977
Well here we go!

845
00:20:37,977 --> 00:20:40,155
I have 10 tentacle fingers

846
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:42,314
- [ Devan] And where exactly is Mary Poppins?

847
00:20:42,314 --> 00:20:43,588
- [Collins] Part of her eye is right there.

848
00:20:43,588 --> 00:20:45,254
She's wearing a green dress, like the wicked witch.

849
00:20:45,254 --> 00:20:46,880
- Now it's time for me to flip mine.

850
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,706
Man, I don't like this at all.

851
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:50,685
No! Stop! - I'm trying to calm you.

852
00:20:50,685 --> 00:20:52,612
- [Both] Oh! (screaming)

853
00:20:52,612 --> 00:20:53,538
- Loud noises!

854
00:20:53,538 --> 00:20:56,003
You're dripping so much batter everywhere, bro,

855
00:20:56,003 --> 00:20:57,836
- Three, two, one. Oh!

856
00:20:58,872 --> 00:21:00,568
- [Collins] What? It looks so good!

857
00:21:00,568 --> 00:21:03,047
- I need that my hands far away so I don't drip on it.

858
00:21:03,047 --> 00:21:03,880
- [Collins] You get to comment

859
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,256
down below who won this round!

860
00:21:05,256 --> 00:21:06,805
Time to eat the pancakes, but there's

861
00:21:06,805 --> 00:21:08,400
a mystery wheel twist to this!

862
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,890
Basically, we only get to eat one pancake

863
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:12,889
and they mystery wheel gets to decide which one that is.

864
00:21:12,889 --> 00:21:14,149
So, we'll spin it, pick it off,

865
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:16,233
and whichever one it says, that's the one we get to eat.

866
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:17,183
I'm super excited!

867
00:21:17,183 --> 00:21:18,169
- Dude, I'm super excited too!

868
00:21:18,169 --> 00:21:19,832
I mean, all of mine are amazing!

869
00:21:19,832 --> 00:21:21,246
Except for Wreck-It Ralph!

870
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:22,815
I hope I don't get Wreck-It Ralph!

871
00:21:22,815 --> 00:21:23,953
- Dude, you put hot sauce in it!

872
00:21:23,953 --> 00:21:25,213
Here we go, the final spin and

873
00:21:25,213 --> 00:21:27,029
possibly the most important one.

874
00:21:27,029 --> 00:21:28,912
- [Both] Three, two, one!

875
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:31,720
- Please not Wreck-It Ralph!

876
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,858
- Alright, I got red, what'd you get?

877
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:34,339
- I got blue, it's a good sign!

878
00:21:34,339 --> 00:21:36,130
- Nice, I got the Fortnight llama, yes!

879
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:37,239
- What do you think the chances are,

880
00:21:37,239 --> 00:21:38,665
that this is not Wreck-It Ralph?

881
00:21:38,665 --> 00:21:39,498
- I mean here's the thing bro,

882
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:41,675
You got Ironman, you got Aquaman, you got Bowser.

883
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,219
Let's give him a little drum roll!

884
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:45,183
- It's more like a little flipper roll, what is that?

885
00:21:45,183 --> 00:21:46,367
- Enough goofin' around, Devan.

886
00:21:46,367 --> 00:21:47,200
Let's see what you got.

887
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,327
- [Both] Three, two, one.

888
00:21:49,327 --> 00:21:51,577
- No! I got Wreck-It Ralph!

889
00:21:52,412 --> 00:21:53,673
- Oh my gosh!

890
00:21:53,673 --> 00:21:54,625
- How?

891
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:55,458
- Bro!

892
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:57,510
- Out of all the pancakes!

893
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:58,842
- Well, I'm gonna take a little bite of

894
00:21:58,842 --> 00:22:01,045
my Fortnite llama right now with you prepare yourself

895
00:22:01,045 --> 00:22:02,856
to take a bit of spicy Wreck-It Ralph.

896
00:22:02,856 --> 00:22:04,197
It's kinda like a chip, almost right now.

897
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:05,074
It's so crisp.

898
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:06,340
- Oh, it smells so bad!

899
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,297
Dude, what are you doing?

900
00:22:07,297 --> 00:22:10,206
