1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,233
- For this, (sneezes)

2
00:00:03,666 --> 00:00:04,580
I think it's edible snot, bro.

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:05,413
- Oh.

4
00:00:05,413 --> 00:00:07,020
- It's snot you can eat.

5
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,340
- For this prank, we're gonna teach you

6
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:09,785
how to make this.

7
00:00:09,785 --> 00:00:10,976
But let's see how it tastes.

8
00:00:10,976 --> 00:00:12,240
- No, no, no, don't do it, aw.

9
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,760
- Oh, oh, oh, it's weird.

10
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,170
- Step number one, you gotta get some water.

11
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:17,510
So you can dump it into one cup.

12
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:20,343
- No, you dump it into the, why would you go

13
00:00:20,343 --> 00:00:21,227
the extra step, bro?

14
00:00:21,227 --> 00:00:22,875
- 'Cause it's a little bit more fancy, you know?

15
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:23,708
Woo.

16
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:25,020
All right, now I gotta turn this thing on to roast it.

17
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,360
Well, due to the sizzling sound,

18
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,550
these waters are ready to go.

19
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,480
Be very careful, this water's super hot.

20
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,290
I don't know why, but I expected it to go poof.

21
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:33,150
All right, so now next up here

22
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:34,825
we gotta add some gelatin in it.

23
00:00:34,825 --> 00:00:35,658
- Yes.

24
00:00:35,658 --> 00:00:36,491
- We got three packets here, Devan.

25
00:00:36,491 --> 00:00:37,324
- Oh, you missed.

26
00:00:37,324 --> 00:00:38,157
- Again.

27
00:00:38,157 --> 00:00:39,147
I was like, he's furious.

28
00:00:39,147 --> 00:00:40,489
Ready, go.

29
00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:41,322
That was a weak eat.

30
00:00:41,322 --> 00:00:42,155
That was a weet. (laughs)

31
00:00:42,155 --> 00:00:43,867
from now on, a weak eat will be known as a weet.

32
00:00:43,867 --> 00:00:45,560
Not to be confused, of course, with the grain.

33
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,230
Very slowly kinda feather it in there.

34
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:48,170
Ooh, that's nice.

35
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:49,090
So now we're gonna mix it around.

36
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,840
We got little plastic forks, 'cause, yeah.

37
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,800
- Probably our mom didn't want us using her nice forks.

38
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,070
- Now he's mixing, mixing, mixing.

39
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,610
Ugh, gelatin smells so bad.

40
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,300
Goals, you don't want a silky smooth texture

41
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,133
like you normally want.

42
00:00:58,133 --> 00:00:59,280
You actually want it to be kinda clumpy

43
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,740
in this instance because it's gotta look like,

44
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:01,980
you know, boogers.

45
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,780
All right, here we go, final packet going in.

46
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,230
All right, well, mine's definitely more clumpy

47
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,063
than it is smooth.

48
00:01:06,063 --> 00:01:07,200
And that's hopefully a good thing.

49
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,779
- And mine is more sm- (mumbles)

50
00:01:09,779 --> 00:01:11,070
And mine is more smooth than it is clumpy.

51
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,583
- So together, Devan, we're best friends.

52
00:01:13,583 --> 00:01:14,416
- Yeah.

53
00:01:14,416 --> 00:01:15,249
- Not.

54
00:01:15,249 --> 00:01:16,082
- What, really, dude?

55
00:01:16,082 --> 00:01:17,060
- Let that sit, and now it's time

56
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,078
for a half cup of corn syrup.

57
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,210
So we got corn syrup.

58
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:20,043
- Ooh, that was close.

59
00:01:20,043 --> 00:01:20,876
- Almost there.

60
00:01:20,876 --> 00:01:21,820
- Ounces, yup, gotta get the cup.

61
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:22,653
- Done, done, done.

62
00:01:22,653 --> 00:01:23,940
We're gonna add the green food colors right now.

63
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,210
This is where the technique comes in.

64
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,140
- Uh oh, oh, oh no, oh no.

65
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:28,588
- I made a mess, I made an absolute mess.

66
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:29,585
- Oh no.

67
00:01:29,585 --> 00:01:30,745
- To mix the dye into the corn syrup,

68
00:01:30,745 --> 00:01:32,029
just gonna splish it around.

69
00:01:32,029 --> 00:01:33,050
It's a real word, look it up.

70
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:34,279
Here we go, it's going mixy, mixy.

71
00:01:34,279 --> 00:01:35,112
Man, this looks kinda funky.

72
00:01:35,112 --> 00:01:35,975
All right, here we go.

73
00:01:35,975 --> 00:01:36,972
Time to add it in.

74
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:37,968
So now just gonna pour it in.

75
00:01:37,968 --> 00:01:39,070
I added way too much food coloring.

76
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:40,400
- Yeah, you definitely did.

77
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,574
Those are gonna be some dark boogers, bro.

78
00:01:42,574 --> 00:01:43,557
- (laughs)

79
00:01:43,557 --> 00:01:44,390
- Mine looks like slime, actually.

80
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:46,620
- It is like slime, bro, look at this.

81
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:47,650
Oh, this is so cool.

82
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:48,690
- You probably wouldn't wanna eat it,

83
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:50,140
'cause it doesn't taste very good, but-

84
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,670
- Yeah, well, so yeah, yeah.

85
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:52,799
- So yup, yup.

86
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:53,898
- Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup.

87
00:01:53,898 --> 00:01:54,898
Now we just gotta let them sit,

88
00:01:54,898 --> 00:01:55,731
and we will try out the boogers for real.

89
00:01:55,731 --> 00:01:56,750
That's a funky one.

90
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:57,902
- I know.

91
00:01:57,902 --> 00:01:58,898
- (laughs)

92
00:01:58,898 --> 00:01:59,731
So the boogers are made.

93
00:01:59,731 --> 00:02:00,913
And now it's time to actually do something

94
00:02:00,913 --> 00:02:01,980
I've wanted to do this whole time.

95
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,850
And that is a sneeze battle.

96
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:04,683
- Oh, all right.

97
00:02:04,683 --> 00:02:06,900
- Right now, brother versus brother, let's begin.

98
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,323
- It's on.

99
00:02:08,323 --> 00:02:09,874
(sneezes)

100
00:02:09,874 --> 00:02:11,100
- Wait, wait, wait, first, five second subscribe challenge.

101
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,990
We wanna see if you can subscribe to this channel

102
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,550
and turn on the channel post notifications

103
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,970
in five seconds.

104
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,256
Are you ready?

105
00:02:17,256 --> 00:02:21,526
- [Together] Five, four, three, two, one, done.

106
00:02:21,526 --> 00:02:22,650
- If you can do that, comment down below.

107
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,057
Keyper squad, right now.

108
00:02:24,057 --> 00:02:25,344
(Devan sneezes)

109
00:02:25,344 --> 00:02:26,430
That's like a high-pitched one.

110
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,728
- Yeah, all right, your turn.

111
00:02:27,728 --> 00:02:29,520
(sneezes)

112
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,923
I'm sorry, what was that?

113
00:02:31,857 --> 00:02:33,649
(sneezes)

114
00:02:33,649 --> 00:02:36,070
- (laughs) I'm literally crying, I'm laughing so hard.

115
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:36,903
This is so funny.

116
00:02:36,903 --> 00:02:38,040
One hand for each nostril.

117
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,483
So check this out.

118
00:02:39,483 --> 00:02:40,316
You ready?

119
00:02:40,316 --> 00:02:41,149
- Oh, boy.

120
00:02:41,149 --> 00:02:41,982
- This is gonna be a good one.

121
00:02:41,982 --> 00:02:42,815
(sneezes)

122
00:02:42,815 --> 00:02:43,648
- Oh, they're like globs.

123
00:02:43,648 --> 00:02:44,481
- This is the finale.

124
00:02:44,481 --> 00:02:45,314
It all comes down to this.

125
00:02:45,314 --> 00:02:46,147
- All right, ready for this?

126
00:02:46,147 --> 00:02:47,058
- No.

127
00:02:47,058 --> 00:02:47,891
(Devan sneezes)

128
00:02:47,891 --> 00:02:49,052
The windup.

129
00:02:49,052 --> 00:02:49,920
You were losing snot out your nose

130
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,753
as you were doing it.

131
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,070
I'm really dedicated to winning,

132
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:54,546
so I'm taking all my previous sneezes all into one.

133
00:02:54,546 --> 00:02:55,886
Final sneeze.

134
00:02:55,886 --> 00:02:56,850
(sneezes)

135
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:59,030
Actually smacked myself in the head.

136
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,462
Is it on my face?

137
00:03:00,462 --> 00:03:01,744
(laughing)

138
00:03:01,744 --> 00:03:02,577
All right, well, you guys gotta comment down below,

139
00:03:02,577 --> 00:03:04,850
who won this round, and who had the best sneezes?

140
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:06,570
And right now, we're onto the next one.

141
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:08,026
Devan, I'm kinda hungry right now.

142
00:03:08,026 --> 00:03:09,034
- Okay.

143
00:03:09,034 --> 00:03:10,053
- So I'm just gonna have some of this.

144
00:03:10,053 --> 00:03:10,886
- All right.

145
00:03:10,886 --> 00:03:12,210
- Whoop, there we go.

146
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,410
- Oh, I get it.

147
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,108
So it's all edible play-doh, right?

148
00:03:15,108 --> 00:03:16,196
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, just try some.

149
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,411
- Okay, cool, awesome.

150
00:03:17,411 --> 00:03:18,406
I'm excited for this.

151
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:19,405
Aw.

152
00:03:19,405 --> 00:03:20,780
- Coming up next, we're gonna show you

153
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,758
how to make edible play-doh.

154
00:03:22,758 --> 00:03:23,591
That stuff's the real stuff.

155
00:03:23,591 --> 00:03:24,729
But right, gonna take a break.

156
00:03:24,729 --> 00:03:25,562
- Why would you do that?

157
00:03:25,562 --> 00:03:26,815
It's like a reverse prank.

158
00:03:26,815 --> 00:03:27,970
It tastes so bad.

159
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:28,803
- Oh, man.

160
00:03:28,803 --> 00:03:30,300
Well, for this, actually we gotta move all the play-doh.

161
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,133
- Whoa, dude.

162
00:03:32,014 --> 00:03:33,130
- Whoa, that was glass.

163
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:34,310
And now we just need a microwave.

164
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,576
So check this out.

165
00:03:35,576 --> 00:03:37,680
Boom, there we go, microwave.

166
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,790
The first thing you gotta do is, wait a minute.

167
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:40,930
- Wait, dude, how do we get it back?

168
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:41,910
- Okay, so I think I have it figured out.

169
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,080
So step one is this.

170
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:43,913
Boom, there we go.

171
00:03:43,913 --> 00:03:44,746
That's how you get it back.

172
00:03:44,746 --> 00:03:46,292
Now we just have to open it,

173
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:47,700
and we cannot close it until the time is right.

174
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,000
Stop moving, stop it.

175
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,365
There we go, thank you.

176
00:03:50,365 --> 00:03:52,253
So now I'm just gonna pop these open.

177
00:03:52,253 --> 00:03:53,700
- Aw, dude, really?

178
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,665
You gotta learn how to open up a package.

179
00:03:55,665 --> 00:03:57,307
- Well, I got a little bit over here, woo,

180
00:03:57,307 --> 00:03:58,937
and then a little bit of woo, woo.

181
00:03:58,937 --> 00:04:00,580
And now time to add a little bit of water.

182
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,687
And when I say a little bit, I literally mean

183
00:04:02,687 --> 00:04:04,430
just a little bit of water.

184
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,263
- Wait, where's mine?

185
00:04:05,263 --> 00:04:06,480
- One, two, three.

186
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,590
- [Together] Whoa.

187
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,636
- There we go. - Wait, what?

188
00:04:08,636 --> 00:04:09,647
- Just add it into yours, nice.

189
00:04:09,647 --> 00:04:10,646
- There we go.

190
00:04:10,646 --> 00:04:11,479
- All right, so now, time to microwave it up.

191
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:12,647
We're gonna pop it in here.

192
00:04:12,647 --> 00:04:13,480
(beep)

193
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,313
I hear the rotating.

194
00:04:14,313 --> 00:04:15,250
All right, time to get my bowl out.

195
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,860
So first, Devan, high five me for good luck.

196
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:17,693
- All right.

197
00:04:17,693 --> 00:04:19,000
- Devan, where, what was that?

198
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,920
Oh, no, I turned him into marshmallows.

199
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,700
Well, I can't eat it.

200
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,533
Devan, come back!

201
00:04:23,533 --> 00:04:25,026
I know what I have to do.

202
00:04:25,026 --> 00:04:26,025
Here's the solution.

203
00:04:26,025 --> 00:04:27,021
I'm just gonna flick him into the seat.

204
00:04:27,021 --> 00:04:28,020
He'll come back.

205
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,023
So I guess here we go.

206
00:04:29,023 --> 00:04:30,045
- [Devan] Ow.

207
00:04:30,045 --> 00:04:31,042
- Nothing, still not here.

208
00:04:31,042 --> 00:04:32,039
Well, there's only one way to get him back.

209
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:33,030
Don't close, I've never done this before.

210
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,380
This will take a lot of concentration, but

211
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,230
I'm gonna see if it works.

212
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,648
Here we go, three, two, one.

213
00:04:36,648 --> 00:04:37,542
- Oh!

214
00:04:37,542 --> 00:04:38,375
- Oh, man, I'm so sorry.

215
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:39,208
- Bro, why?

216
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:40,280
I was sunbathing.

217
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,420
- In a long-sleeved shirt and long pants,

218
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,210
you were sunbathing?

219
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:46,000
Well, you're definitely looking a lot more tan, Devan.

220
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,170
- Yeah, right.

221
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,220
- My marshmallows are melted.

222
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,430
- And so are mine.

223
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,520
Well, I was outside, sunbathing, bro, the sun.

224
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,700
- Oh, that makes sense.

225
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,875
Now it's time to turn it into play-doh.

226
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:56,600
Not technically, well, like, (mumbles)

227
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,620
Now we're gonna add some sugar,

228
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,170
because this is actually gonna make it less sticky

229
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,400
and make it turn into play-doh.

230
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,700
I'm gonna go about half the bag.

231
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,040
This kinda reminds me of slime a little bit.

232
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,160
We're actually gonna take some powdered sugar

233
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,800
and dump it on the table like this.

234
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,750
Hand print.

235
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,583
- [Together] Oh!

236
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:09,710
- Why, Collins?

237
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,108
- I didn't think that through.

238
00:05:11,108 --> 00:05:12,664
- This is gonna take forever to clean up.

239
00:05:12,664 --> 00:05:14,300
- Well, I've got all over my shirt.

240
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,350
- Bro.

241
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,349
- But it's time for the next step.

242
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:17,182
- [Devan] Oh, look at that.

243
00:05:17,182 --> 00:05:18,015
- The fork is just on it.

244
00:05:18,015 --> 00:05:19,600
So we're gonna try to use the powdered sugar.

245
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,940
It's a dough, but it's all sugar.

246
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,010
I call this one the great twist of tar tar.

247
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,230
Tar tar tar (laughs).

248
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,280
- We have to use so much more powdered sugar

249
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,113
than I thought.

250
00:05:28,113 --> 00:05:28,946
I mean, look at this.

251
00:05:28,946 --> 00:05:30,270
It's still sticking to my hand.

252
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,580
I love how warm it is, too.

253
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:34,110
It's like, I don't know, a hot sauna for your hands.

254
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,114
(Collins laughs)

255
00:05:35,114 --> 00:05:36,060
Ah, look at mine.

256
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,242
- Whoa dude, that looks so good.

257
00:05:37,242 --> 00:05:38,930
- Oh, no, it's still a little sticky.

258
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:41,370
My goodness, this is so cool.

259
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:42,940
Dude, is it snowing?

260
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:43,860
Oh, hey, Collins.

261
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,840
This is turning out like butter slime.

262
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,740
Look at this.

263
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,735
- [Collins] No way.

264
00:05:47,735 --> 00:05:48,755
- [Devan] It is, just look at the texture of it.

265
00:05:48,755 --> 00:05:49,588
- Whoa.

266
00:05:49,588 --> 00:05:50,540
The base is done, and now it's time

267
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,580
to add the food coloring and turn it into play-doh.

268
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,890
So for this, we've got some gloves.

269
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,070
So Devan, you wanna pop some gloves on.

270
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,257
- Yes.

271
00:05:56,257 --> 00:05:57,266
- I actually duplicated this glove

272
00:05:57,266 --> 00:05:58,306
by just pulling, and like, check it out.

273
00:05:58,306 --> 00:05:59,322
One, two, three.

274
00:05:59,322 --> 00:06:00,155
Boom, there we go.

275
00:06:00,155 --> 00:06:00,988
- Whoa. - Got my other glove.

276
00:06:00,988 --> 00:06:01,821
- I'm gonna use blue.

277
00:06:01,821 --> 00:06:02,654
What are you gonna use?

278
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:03,487
- I'm gonna use pink, or red, I don't know.

279
00:06:03,487 --> 00:06:04,661
- I guess like drop kinda all over.

280
00:06:04,661 --> 00:06:05,810
- Ah!

281
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,370
It's definitely oozing out.

282
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:08,461
No!

283
00:06:08,461 --> 00:06:09,467
- I've got mine under control.

284
00:06:09,467 --> 00:06:10,450
- This is so tough to manage.

285
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:13,114
No, no, oh, geez, I got a bowl.

286
00:06:13,114 --> 00:06:14,773
Oh, look at that!

287
00:06:14,773 --> 00:06:15,830
- Whoa, no, juice out the bottom.

288
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,480
Oh, snap, look at it, bro.

289
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,590
Looks like an alien.

290
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:21,090
- Oh, oh, oh, all right.

291
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,448
Look at that.

292
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:23,468
That looks so cool.

293
00:06:23,468 --> 00:06:24,465
- It's like a marble.

294
00:06:24,465 --> 00:06:25,465
No!

295
00:06:25,465 --> 00:06:26,459
I didn't even realize my glove broke.

296
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:27,650
My finger's literally as blue as the glove.

297
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:28,660
That's wack.

298
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,100
Well, here are the finished products.

299
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,663
So you get to comment down below who won this round.

300
00:06:32,663 --> 00:06:33,650
Right, Devan, you wanna take a bite of it?

301
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,014
- Uh, yeah.

302
00:06:35,014 --> 00:06:35,847
- Okay, but first I gotta remove my glove,

303
00:06:35,847 --> 00:06:36,920
because I wanna see how my finger looks.

304
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,300
Ready?

305
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,297
- [Devan] Yup.

306
00:06:39,297 --> 00:06:40,314
- [Together] Oh!

307
00:06:40,314 --> 00:06:41,310
Three, two, one.

308
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,143
- Oh!

309
00:06:42,143 --> 00:06:42,976
- It's so good!

310
00:06:44,253 --> 00:06:46,152
- Oh my goodness.

311
00:06:46,152 --> 00:06:47,340
- This is my favorite one we've ever made.

312
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,740
All right, guys, right now we are on to the next round.

313
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,420
- Bro, it's like taffy.

314
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,640
Oh, your teeth are blue.

315
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,839
- Oh, no, okay.

316
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:55,308
(incoherent shouting)

317
00:06:55,308 --> 00:06:56,610
Devan?

318
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:57,443
- Huh?

319
00:06:57,443 --> 00:06:58,276
- Hey, Devan?

320
00:06:58,276 --> 00:06:59,109
- Huh, what, what?

321
00:06:59,109 --> 00:06:59,942
That's all right, I was just taking a little nap.

322
00:06:59,942 --> 00:07:00,819
- Take a little nap?

323
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:01,814
I've got a pepper, Devan.

324
00:07:01,814 --> 00:07:02,810
Do you want this pepper?

325
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:03,807
- Uh, no, but thanks.

326
00:07:03,807 --> 00:07:04,872
- Are you sure you don't want this pepper?

327
00:07:04,872 --> 00:07:05,705
- Dude, I'm all set.

328
00:07:05,705 --> 00:07:06,538
I don't need a pepper.

329
00:07:06,538 --> 00:07:07,371
- Final time, do you want the pepper?

330
00:07:07,371 --> 00:07:09,200
- I'm good with the glasses, thank you.

331
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,033
- Fine, I'll have it.

332
00:07:10,033 --> 00:07:11,401
- Wait, what?

333
00:07:11,401 --> 00:07:12,360
No, okay, now I want the pepper.

334
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,416
- You coulda had the pepper.

335
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:14,249
- Well, I want it now.

336
00:07:14,249 --> 00:07:15,201
- So this is a prank where

337
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:16,060
you can actually sneak candy into class,

338
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,540
make it look like a vegetable.

339
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,410
So right now, ow.

340
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,170
- [Devan] That smacked you in the head.

341
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,460
- Now it's time for the veggies.

342
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,293
Whoa, jesus!

343
00:07:22,293 --> 00:07:23,819
- Ah! - Oh my god!

344
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:25,090
- Get them out of here!

345
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:25,923
Ya, ya, ya!

346
00:07:25,923 --> 00:07:27,040
Holy cow, bam.

347
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,475
- I got the carrot!

348
00:07:28,475 --> 00:07:30,750
- (laughs) Wow, that escalated quickly.

349
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,930
So we just grabbed a regular head of lettuce,

350
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,200
and Devan grabbed his pepper.

351
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,850
First, you gotta activate your magic hands.

352
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:36,683
- Okay.

353
00:07:36,683 --> 00:07:37,697
- Go like this.

354
00:07:37,697 --> 00:07:38,693
- Activate.

355
00:07:38,693 --> 00:07:39,686
- Boom, just like that.

356
00:07:39,686 --> 00:07:40,682
And we gotta chop it in half.

357
00:07:40,682 --> 00:07:41,686
- [Devan] Ya!

358
00:07:41,686 --> 00:07:42,696
- It doesn't work for you.

359
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:43,698
You gotta have magic hands.

360
00:07:43,698 --> 00:07:44,531
- Oh, fine.

361
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:45,364
- Here we go.

362
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:46,302
Three, two, one, boom, just like that.

363
00:07:46,302 --> 00:07:47,135
There we go.

364
00:07:47,135 --> 00:07:47,968
Chop it like that.

365
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:48,801
- [Devan] Wow, all right.

366
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:49,634
- So here you go, Devan. - Thank you.

367
00:07:49,634 --> 00:07:50,467
- And now you just have to hollow it out.

368
00:07:50,467 --> 00:07:51,300
So you know how we do this, Devan?

369
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,133
- I do not.

370
00:07:52,133 --> 00:07:52,966
- Super secret technique called this.

371
00:07:52,966 --> 00:07:53,799
- (laughs) Okay.

372
00:07:53,799 --> 00:07:54,632
- This is the technique.

373
00:07:54,632 --> 00:07:55,605
You gotta go.

374
00:07:55,605 --> 00:07:56,626
- [Devan] I don't know if this is really

375
00:07:56,626 --> 00:07:57,623
gonna work for mine.

376
00:07:57,623 --> 00:07:58,634
- [Collins] Pull out the stuff in the middle of it.

377
00:07:58,634 --> 00:07:59,633
- See, look at mine.

378
00:07:59,633 --> 00:08:00,631
- Pull it out.

379
00:08:00,631 --> 00:08:01,628
- I got a ton of seeds and, yeah.

380
00:08:01,628 --> 00:08:02,645
Yeah, that didn't work.

381
00:08:02,645 --> 00:08:03,478
- Next up, all we need is the candy.

382
00:08:03,478 --> 00:08:04,311
- Oh! - Aw!

383
00:08:04,311 --> 00:08:05,290
- Ow, that actually hurt.

384
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,616
Just gonna pop these in here like this.

385
00:08:06,616 --> 00:08:08,880
And this is how you can sneak candy into class

386
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,713
and make it look like you're about

387
00:08:09,713 --> 00:08:10,650
to eat a healthy snack.

388
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:11,483
Pop the bottom on.

389
00:08:11,483 --> 00:08:13,179
- Ta da, look at that.

390
00:08:13,179 --> 00:08:14,180
- And now that you've got a nice little

391
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,176
head of lettuce.

392
00:08:15,176 --> 00:08:16,009
- And an on, no, a pepper.

393
00:08:16,009 --> 00:08:17,650
- So comment down below, which one will you use?

394
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:18,770
A lettuce or a pepper?

395
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:21,360
So guys, right now we are on to the next round.

396
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,307
- Whoa, those still have the wrappers on those.

397
00:08:23,307 --> 00:08:24,390
- Has the wrapper on it, yeah.

398
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,795
- Hey, Collins, I have a drink for you.

399
00:08:25,795 --> 00:08:27,560
- Oh my gosh, what is that?

400
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,270
Oh, and we have a huge announcement coming up

401
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,103
on July 28th.

402
00:08:30,103 --> 00:08:31,920
- Bro, I am so excited.

403
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,753
- You guys are gonna love this.

404
00:08:32,753 --> 00:08:34,160
So comment down below what you think it is.

405
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:34,993
- Comment down below.

406
00:08:34,993 --> 00:08:37,040
- And also, we're giving away a 15-minute video

407
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:37,950
call with Devan and I.

408
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,630
So all you have to do if you wanna enter into that

409
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:43,324
is text the word key to 81800.

410
00:08:43,324 --> 00:08:44,157
So pause the video right now,

411
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:45,950
go text that number the word key,

412
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:46,783
and you will be entered.

413
00:08:46,783 --> 00:08:47,890
And we're so excited to connect with you.

414
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:49,193
And right now, let's go.

415
00:08:49,193 --> 00:08:50,261
- It's a jello drink, bro! (laughs)

416
00:08:50,261 --> 00:08:51,153
- What's the prank?

417
00:08:51,153 --> 00:08:52,480
Just like splat it?

418
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,780
- No, the prank is that it didn't get everywhere.

419
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,590
I think it even makes a more solid jello.

420
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,506
So first of all, we uncap this.

421
00:08:58,506 --> 00:08:59,339
- Ah! Geez.

422
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,260
- And we pour it all into, the, oh my goodness.

423
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,520
- What are you doing?

424
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,543
- All right, so you do that.

425
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,376
No, what are you doing?

426
00:09:04,376 --> 00:09:05,660
You can't be drinking it.

427
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,410
Next up, you stick your gelatin

428
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:08,840
and pour it into here.

429
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,440
- [Collins] Did yours bubble up as much as mine bubbled up?

430
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,320
Did you turn your heat on?

431
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,153
- No, not yet.

432
00:09:12,153 --> 00:09:13,160
You will, but not now.

433
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,594
- Okay.

434
00:09:14,594 --> 00:09:15,427
- And now you turn on your heat.

435
00:09:15,427 --> 00:09:16,260
- Oh my gosh.

436
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,680
Oh man, mine's getting kinda chunky and funky

437
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,250
a little bit here.

438
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,320
- What? Gotta get the chunks.

439
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,430
We hear the sizzling sound,

440
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:23,210
so that means it's time to pour it

441
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:25,470
into our measuring cups very carefully,

442
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,610
'cause it's very hot.

443
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:27,814
And now-

444
00:09:27,814 --> 00:09:28,647
- Ah!

445
00:09:28,647 --> 00:09:29,480
- What?

446
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,313
What, what, what, what, what?

447
00:09:30,313 --> 00:09:31,146
- Oh my gosh.

448
00:09:31,146 --> 00:09:31,979
- We're good, all under control.

449
00:09:31,979 --> 00:09:32,812
- Doesn't sound like it's all under control.

450
00:09:32,812 --> 00:09:33,754
- You pour it into your bottle.

451
00:09:33,754 --> 00:09:34,754
- Uh oh.

452
00:09:34,754 --> 00:09:35,752
Dude, it's burning.

453
00:09:35,752 --> 00:09:36,748
It's smelling real bad.

454
00:09:36,748 --> 00:09:37,764
- Complete concentration.

455
00:09:37,764 --> 00:09:38,759
- You're dripping, do your thing.

456
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:39,755
- All right, all right, all right.

457
00:09:39,755 --> 00:09:40,752
- Almost there, almost there.

458
00:09:40,752 --> 00:09:41,764
I'm like so nervous right now.

459
00:09:41,764 --> 00:09:42,597
How does mine have more than yours?

460
00:09:42,597 --> 00:09:43,776
- Well, this is where the rest of mine went.

461
00:09:43,776 --> 00:09:44,609
- Oh.

462
00:09:44,609 --> 00:09:46,680
- Right, now it's time to pop them in the fridge and wait.

463
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,943
- Cool.

464
00:09:47,943 --> 00:09:49,610
- Dude, these things expanded in the freezer.

465
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:50,443
These are-

466
00:09:50,443 --> 00:09:51,440
- [Together] So cool!

467
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,893
Oh!

468
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,146
- Dude, it's like you go to drink it, ah.

469
00:09:56,146 --> 00:09:57,142
- Ah.

470
00:09:57,142 --> 00:09:58,139
- And then nothing comes out.

471
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,350
Three, two, one.

472
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:00,390
Oh.

473
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,223
- How is it?

474
00:10:01,223 --> 00:10:02,570
Do you get thumbs up?

475
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:04,300
Yeah, double thumbs up, all right.

476
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,133
What, what, what?

477
00:10:05,133 --> 00:10:06,491
The texture, oh, the texture,

478
00:10:06,491 --> 00:10:09,403
oh, the money, love the money.

479
00:10:09,403 --> 00:10:10,590
(laughs) I don't know.

480
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,532
Oh, it's actually sparkling.

481
00:10:12,532 --> 00:10:14,730
Shoulda done like pops, you know, like woo.

482
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,270
- Comment down below, what is your favorite drink

483
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,600
you would love to turn into jello

484
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,433
and prank people with?

485
00:10:18,433 --> 00:10:20,040
And right now, we are on to the next one.

486
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,520
- Cheers, oh, wait, okay.

487
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,520
Hey, Collins, you want some tea?

488
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,360
- Oh, yeah, absolutely, man.

489
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,047
Thank you so much.

490
00:10:25,047 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm actually really thirsty right now.

491
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,833
- Yeah.

492
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:27,666
- It's not coming out.

493
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:28,545
- Oh, really?

494
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:29,378
- What'd you put in here?

495
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:30,618
- Well, I thought I put, oh!

496
00:10:30,618 --> 00:10:31,627
- What?

497
00:10:31,627 --> 00:10:32,645
- (laughs) It worked.

498
00:10:32,645 --> 00:10:33,580
That was so good.

499
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,560
- Wait, what just happened to me.

500
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,070
I'm like soaking wet now.

501
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:37,317
- You're about to find out.

502
00:10:37,317 --> 00:10:39,970
All right, Collins, first step is to remove the bottom.

503
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,050
- Okay, ah, so here we go.

504
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:42,562
Let me try like this.

505
00:10:42,562 --> 00:10:43,683
- Oh, okay.

506
00:10:43,683 --> 00:10:44,516
- And three, two, one, boom, there we go.

507
00:10:44,516 --> 00:10:45,349
- Whoa. - Bottom comes right off.

508
00:10:45,349 --> 00:10:46,758
- First gotta get rid of this, so.

509
00:10:46,758 --> 00:10:49,040
- (laughs) That was effective.

510
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,159
- Hey, Devan.

511
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:50,992
- What?

512
00:10:50,992 --> 00:10:51,825
- What's the next step?

513
00:10:51,825 --> 00:10:52,658
- The next step is to grab some saran wrap.

514
00:10:52,658 --> 00:10:54,331
- Wow, that's a lot of saran wrap.

515
00:10:54,331 --> 00:10:55,328
- It is a lot, yes.

516
00:10:55,328 --> 00:10:56,161
So you put it on the top here.

517
00:10:56,161 --> 00:10:57,500
And next up, what we do is we grab

518
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,850
a rubber band, and you wrap it around the side.

519
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,293
Really, dude?

520
00:11:02,293 --> 00:11:03,126
Why?

521
00:11:03,126 --> 00:11:03,959
You're still on that.

522
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:04,792
All right, I'll wait for you.

523
00:11:04,792 --> 00:11:06,490
So now you have the divot inside

524
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:08,460
so you can put the water in.

525
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,910
Nicely done, you got it.

526
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:12,610
One more layer of saran wrap, grab it off.

527
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:13,443
- Great grab.

528
00:11:13,443 --> 00:11:14,740
- Thank you, whoa, hey.

529
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,781
- I thought this was for me.

530
00:11:15,781 --> 00:11:16,778
- Hey, no.

531
00:11:16,778 --> 00:11:17,611
All right, next up, we put the lid on.

532
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:19,820
Now we remove the excess saran wrap.

533
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,886
- How?

534
00:11:20,886 --> 00:11:21,719
- With your magic skills, Collins.

535
00:11:21,719 --> 00:11:22,893
- All right, bam, there we go.

536
00:11:22,893 --> 00:11:24,590
Want me to get yours, too?

537
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:25,690
- Uh, yeah, yeah, that would be great.

538
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:27,469
- [Together] Three, two, one.

539
00:11:27,469 --> 00:11:28,498
- Boom, there we go.

540
00:11:28,498 --> 00:11:29,582
Yours is all done now.

541
00:11:29,582 --> 00:11:30,415
So this prank is awesome, because

542
00:11:30,415 --> 00:11:32,100
now it's fully made, and if you go to drink it.

543
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,640
- Oh, wait. (laughs)

544
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,207
- Nothing comes out. (laughs)

545
00:11:35,207 --> 00:11:36,471
And then they'll pull the top off.

546
00:11:36,471 --> 00:11:37,624
So here we go.

547
00:11:37,624 --> 00:11:38,627
- [Together] Three, two, one, oh!

548
00:11:38,627 --> 00:11:39,896
- And they'll get water everywhere,

549
00:11:39,896 --> 00:11:41,510
and especially on themselves.

550
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,190
Comment down below, who in your family

551
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:44,210
would you prank with this?

552
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:45,920
And right now, we are on to the next one.

553
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,090
- For this one, Collins, you have to close your eyes.

554
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:48,923
- Dude, this is a prank video.

555
00:11:48,923 --> 00:11:49,880
I'm not gonna close my eyes.

556
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,310
- Collins, close your eyes.

557
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,303
- Okay.

558
00:11:52,303 --> 00:11:53,136
- (laughs) All right, we have the item here.

559
00:11:53,136 --> 00:11:55,610
And now I'm going to take it out of its container.

560
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:56,443
- Wait, what is it?

561
00:11:56,443 --> 00:11:57,780
- We're doing a blind taste test.

562
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,613
Open your mouth.

563
00:11:58,613 --> 00:12:00,133
- Ah. - Here we go.

564
00:12:00,133 --> 00:12:01,131
- Oh.

565
00:12:01,131 --> 00:12:02,165
- Dude, you just closed it.

566
00:12:02,165 --> 00:12:02,998
- Well, I don't wanna eat it.

567
00:12:02,998 --> 00:12:04,060
- And bite down.

568
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,949
Dude, just go for it.

569
00:12:05,949 --> 00:12:06,850
- Tastes like cheese, right?

570
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:07,683
- You can open your eyes.

571
00:12:07,683 --> 00:12:08,850
- Glue!

572
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:10,250
Wait, wait, wait, you make glue taste like cheese?

573
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,740
- No, no, Collins, it's actually cheese.

574
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,000
That's the prank.

575
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,833
Got him!

576
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:14,666
- Oh, oh, oh, oh.

577
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:16,260
So you put cheese in glue sticks.

578
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,950
- Yep, yep, that's what it is.

579
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,460
Oh, dude.

580
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,810
- Oh my gosh, ate the plastic.

581
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:22,140
- All right, well, here's how you make the prank.

582
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,828
- Okay, pop the top off, and.

583
00:12:23,828 --> 00:12:25,710
- (laughs) It came back.

584
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:26,790
- The first thing is gonna be,

585
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,850
you cannot start yet, stop.

586
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,677
- I already started, I already started.

587
00:12:29,677 --> 00:12:30,707
- Stop, stop, this is a race.

588
00:12:30,707 --> 00:12:31,707
- I'm still going.

589
00:12:31,707 --> 00:12:32,705
- No, no, no, stop.

590
00:12:32,705 --> 00:12:33,716
Whoever gets it out first wins.

591
00:12:33,716 --> 00:12:34,549
- I got it, I did it, I did it!

592
00:12:34,549 --> 00:12:35,725
It's done, it's out.

593
00:12:35,725 --> 00:12:36,558
(sad music)

594
00:12:36,558 --> 00:12:38,119
- Man, well, I deformed mine on the way out.

595
00:12:38,119 --> 00:12:39,370
You're actually gonna need to get rid of your glue sticks.

596
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:40,623
Throwing it at the cheese.

597
00:12:40,623 --> 00:12:41,627
I'm not happy you cheating.

598
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:42,623
- Really, really?

599
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,456
- You're a little cheese cheater.

600
00:12:43,456 --> 00:12:45,200
- I would eat this, but it'd stick to the wall.

601
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,450
- Whoa.

602
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,357
- [Devan] Wow, that's actually pretty sweet.

603
00:12:47,357 --> 00:12:48,960
- So the next part is super easy.

604
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,278
Just wash out your glue stick, and then-

605
00:12:50,278 --> 00:12:51,448
- Done.

606
00:12:51,448 --> 00:12:52,670
- Just do that.

607
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,834
- Yeah! Look at that!

608
00:12:53,834 --> 00:12:55,670
- I'm just gonna push it all the way through.

609
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:56,690
Boom, all right, there we go.

610
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:58,201
Break the cheese off.

611
00:12:58,201 --> 00:12:59,211
- Mine's not coming out.

612
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:00,044
Oh, there we go, look at that.

613
00:13:00,044 --> 00:13:00,877
- Dude, I'm actually.

614
00:13:00,877 --> 00:13:02,213
- Yeah!

615
00:13:02,213 --> 00:13:03,210
- I'm gonna go multiple rows in mine.

616
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:04,043
We're just gonna put it down.

617
00:13:04,043 --> 00:13:05,550
- Look at that, it turned into Swiss cheese.

618
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,898
- Why?

619
00:13:06,898 --> 00:13:07,891
- Because it's holey.

620
00:13:07,891 --> 00:13:08,909
- Ay!

621
00:13:08,909 --> 00:13:09,904
Now you got a cheese glue stick

622
00:13:09,904 --> 00:13:10,901
and you can now eat this in class

623
00:13:10,901 --> 00:13:11,899
and freak people out.

624
00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:13,510
So right now, we are on to the next round.

625
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,590
- Bro, my pen's out.

626
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:15,894
- [Collins] Pen's out?

627
00:13:15,894 --> 00:13:16,727
Oh, here, hold on.

628
00:13:16,727 --> 00:13:17,684
- [Devan] Can you get me a new one?

629
00:13:17,684 --> 00:13:18,517
- [Collins] Yeah, yeah, yeah, here you go.

630
00:13:18,517 --> 00:13:19,350
- Oh, wait! - Oh, snap!

631
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:20,674
- So guys, we're gonna teach you

632
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:22,262
how to make a pen that will leak ink all over.

633
00:13:22,262 --> 00:13:23,263
- Dude, what?

634
00:13:23,263 --> 00:13:24,096
- Your friend's paper, just like that.

635
00:13:24,096 --> 00:13:25,533
- I didn't get to finish my spaceship diagram, bro.

636
00:13:25,533 --> 00:13:26,840
- That was a spaceship?

637
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,673
So here's how-

638
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:29,036
- Oh, dude, what?

639
00:13:29,036 --> 00:13:30,056
- What was that?

640
00:13:30,056 --> 00:13:30,889
So here's how you empty out the pen.

641
00:13:30,889 --> 00:13:31,920
First step, first step, gotta remove

642
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,040
the tippy top of your pen.

643
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:33,940
- All right, done.

644
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,320
With your teeth?

645
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,444
For what purpose?

646
00:13:36,444 --> 00:13:38,794
It's not a kazoo, Collins.

647
00:13:38,794 --> 00:13:39,808
- Or is it?

648
00:13:39,808 --> 00:13:41,158
(kazoo noises)

649
00:13:41,158 --> 00:13:41,991
- [Devan] That's my cap.

650
00:13:41,991 --> 00:13:42,824
Don't disrespect a cap.

651
00:13:42,824 --> 00:13:43,900
- Next up, gonna take some scissors.

652
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:44,733
Be very careful.

653
00:13:44,733 --> 00:13:45,980
When you pull up, this thingy

654
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:46,813
comes out of this thingy.

655
00:13:46,813 --> 00:13:48,020
- You can't just do it with your fingers?

656
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:48,853
- You can do it with your fingers,

657
00:13:48,853 --> 00:13:50,010
you are a superhero.

658
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:51,080
- Yeah!

659
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,970
I'm a superhero, what!

660
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:54,050
- What on earth!

661
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:54,960
You're gonna stick the wooden stick

662
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,487
inside of it like this, and then

663
00:13:56,487 --> 00:13:58,658
you're gonna kinda break it off down here like this.

664
00:13:58,658 --> 00:13:59,655
- What?

665
00:13:59,655 --> 00:14:00,653
- [Collins] 'Cause you gotta get the top thingy

666
00:14:00,653 --> 00:14:01,646
right here off.

667
00:14:01,646 --> 00:14:02,648
- [Devan] Can't you just.

668
00:14:02,648 --> 00:14:03,660
- Yeah, but-

669
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,658
- Just like that?

670
00:14:04,658 --> 00:14:05,657
- Wow.

671
00:14:05,657 --> 00:14:06,490
This is the actual part of the pen that you write with.

672
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:07,427
So fun fact, you can write things

673
00:14:07,427 --> 00:14:08,260
with just a little part here.

674
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,256
So like, what!

675
00:14:09,256 --> 00:14:10,089
- Wow.

676
00:14:10,089 --> 00:14:10,922
- Sweet.

677
00:14:10,922 --> 00:14:12,161
- Oh, no, bro, it's on my fingers.

678
00:14:12,161 --> 00:14:13,161
- Yeah, how'd you pull off the top, though?

679
00:14:13,161 --> 00:14:14,158
- You just pull it off.

680
00:14:14,158 --> 00:14:15,156
It's super easy.

681
00:14:15,156 --> 00:14:15,989
- Okay, ah!

682
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:16,822
No!

683
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:17,655
- [Devan] Bro.

684
00:14:17,655 --> 00:14:18,488
It's like finger painting.

685
00:14:18,488 --> 00:14:19,346
Abstract art, look at it.

686
00:14:19,346 --> 00:14:20,179
- Oh no, no.

687
00:14:20,179 --> 00:14:21,012
We're making a mess.

688
00:14:21,012 --> 00:14:22,334
Ink is everywhere.

689
00:14:22,334 --> 00:14:23,337
Oh no!

690
00:14:23,337 --> 00:14:24,980
Dude, we've ruined our table.

691
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:25,813
- We need a sponge.

692
00:14:25,813 --> 00:14:27,260
- Get a sponge, please, bro,

693
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,110
'cause we are gonna be in such big trouble.

694
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,070
That's making it worse.

695
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,147
Here we go, I got some water.

696
00:14:31,147 --> 00:14:31,980
- And I got a sponge.

697
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,142
- Oh, it's a lot of water.

698
00:14:33,142 --> 00:14:34,050
I'm trying to use the water to clean it up.

699
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:36,070
Uh oh, I think this mighta stained the table, Devan.

700
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,266
- No!

701
00:14:37,266 --> 00:14:38,099
- Dude, okay, we gotta, we gotta-

702
00:14:38,099 --> 00:14:39,030
- This is a brand new table.

703
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:41,490
- Not a joke, we've ruined the table!

704
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:43,430
- Now we have this all sanitized.

705
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:44,560
- Yup, we've got a plastic bag

706
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,590
along with paper towels.

707
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,430
- No more spillage.

708
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:48,000
- So now, come take some of the shoe polish.

709
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,833
- Okay.

710
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:49,774
- Just gonna pop it-

711
00:14:49,774 --> 00:14:50,771
- What?

712
00:14:50,771 --> 00:14:51,767
- Maybe if I turn upside down?

713
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:52,763
- [Devan] Squeeze it.

714
00:14:52,763 --> 00:14:53,596
- [Collins] Nothing, nothing.

715
00:14:53,596 --> 00:14:54,429
I wonder if it's pressure release,

716
00:14:54,429 --> 00:14:56,387
so like if I touch it here, oh!

717
00:14:56,387 --> 00:14:57,864
- Oh, nice!

718
00:14:57,864 --> 00:15:00,090
- And that's why our table is covered.

719
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:00,923
- Oh!

720
00:15:00,923 --> 00:15:02,710
Next up here, we're gonna take these little

721
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,260
eye dropper squeezy thingies,

722
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,650
pop the top off of it, and then you're gonna

723
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:07,000
put it here on the pen.

724
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,360
And it'll actually be able to suction up

725
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,193
the shoe polish.

726
00:15:09,193 --> 00:15:10,850
And check this out, gonna squeeze it, go in.

727
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:11,790
All right, here's the first test

728
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:12,623
to see if it works.

729
00:15:12,623 --> 00:15:13,620
Gonna squeeze and see if anything comes out.

730
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,172
- Oh!

731
00:15:15,172 --> 00:15:16,207
- Yo.

732
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:17,238
- Nice.

733
00:15:17,238 --> 00:15:18,296
- Okay, it works, it works.

734
00:15:18,296 --> 00:15:19,343
- Still haven't figured this thing out, dude.

735
00:15:19,343 --> 00:15:20,396
- Here comes the front part of it.

736
00:15:20,396 --> 00:15:21,229
You have to put this pen tip back on.

737
00:15:21,229 --> 00:15:23,194
Oh no, I dropped my pen tip in there.

738
00:15:23,194 --> 00:15:24,200
- What, what?

739
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,229
Why would you do that?

740
00:15:25,229 --> 00:15:26,300
- I'm actually gonna go in for a little rescue mission

741
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,690
with my squeezy squeezy eye thing.

742
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:28,580
- Good luck with that.

743
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,413
- I see it.

744
00:15:29,413 --> 00:15:30,765
Ah, I almost had it.

745
00:15:30,765 --> 00:15:31,793
Here we go, gonna use this thingy to get it out.

746
00:15:31,793 --> 00:15:32,789
And there we go.

747
00:15:32,789 --> 00:15:33,785
- Finally.

748
00:15:33,785 --> 00:15:34,782
- Finally got the top out.

749
00:15:34,782 --> 00:15:35,778
- [Devan] What have you done?

750
00:15:35,778 --> 00:15:36,793
- I didn't realize that it got so messy

751
00:15:36,793 --> 00:15:37,796
during the process.

752
00:15:37,796 --> 00:15:38,794
- What have you done?

753
00:15:38,794 --> 00:15:39,787
- There we go, a little bit sucked up.

754
00:15:39,787 --> 00:15:40,865
And then pop the top on.

755
00:15:40,865 --> 00:15:41,928
Come on, work with me.

756
00:15:41,928 --> 00:15:42,761
Done.

757
00:15:42,761 --> 00:15:43,594

758
00:15:43,594 --> 00:15:44,427
- Bam, got that.

759
00:15:44,427 --> 00:15:45,260
So now if you go to write.

760
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,093
- So if you go like this.

761
00:15:46,093 --> 00:15:46,926
- Oh! - Oh, you got that on my hand.

762
00:15:46,926 --> 00:15:47,759
- I thought I got it on your shirt for a second.

763
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:48,743
I was like, oh no!

764
00:15:48,743 --> 00:15:49,762

- Guys, I literally replaced Devan's face wash

775
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,220
