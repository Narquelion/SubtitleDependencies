00:00:02,557 --> 00:00:04,819
(glass shattering) (long beep)

2
00:00:04,819 --> 00:00:06,044
- What's up? It's Collins Key

3
00:00:06,044 --> 00:00:07,669
and welcome to the Thursday vlog.

4
00:00:07,669 --> 00:00:09,225
Now for today's video I'm really excited

5
00:00:09,225 --> 00:00:10,813
because as you guys saw from the title

6
00:00:10,813 --> 00:00:12,945
I'm going to be recreating popular GIFs.

7
00:00:12,945 --> 00:00:14,014
And to start things off

8
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,656
I know you guys are gonna be going it's Jif, it's Gif.

9
00:00:16,656 --> 00:00:18,159
I did a ton of research on this

10
00:00:18,159 --> 00:00:20,794
and definitively there is no answer.

11
00:00:20,794 --> 00:00:21,859
So I've made the executive decision

12
00:00:21,859 --> 00:00:24,425
for this video I'm gonna be calling them GIFs.

13
00:00:24,425 --> 00:00:26,577
If you don't agree with me, I apologize.

14
00:00:26,577 --> 00:00:28,373
And now it's time to find some GIFs to recreate.

15
00:00:28,373 --> 00:00:29,602
Now my friends they've all been telling me about

16
00:00:29,602 --> 00:00:31,872
this brand new streaming service, it's called fullscreen.

17
00:00:31,872 --> 00:00:33,544
And they have a whole bunch of original series,

18
00:00:33,544 --> 00:00:35,566
popular TV shows, they have feature films.

19
00:00:35,566 --> 00:00:36,685
And what I love about it is that

20
00:00:36,685 --> 00:00:38,438
you can actually make your own GIFs.

21
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:40,442
Like they have a custom GIF creation tool.

22
00:00:40,442 --> 00:00:41,739
So as you're watching your favorite show,

23
00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:43,050
you can pick a little part of it

24
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,111
and then make it in to a GIF.

25
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:45,378
So today's I'm just gonna be havin' fun

26
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:46,306
like goin' through the app,

27
00:00:46,306 --> 00:00:47,938
trying to find just my favorite GIFs

28
00:00:47,938 --> 00:00:49,422
and then I'm gonna recreate them.

29
00:00:49,422 --> 00:00:51,396
Without any further ado, let's jump right in right now.

30
00:00:51,396 --> 00:00:53,128
And let's create some JIFs.

31
00:00:53,128 --> 00:00:55,274
Or GIFs, oh that was close.

32
00:00:55,274 --> 00:00:57,023
(laughing) Let's create some GIFs.

33
00:00:57,023 --> 00:00:58,147
Okay, let's get started.

34
00:00:58,147 --> 00:00:59,559
I'm just gonna open up my phone right now.

35
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,386
Going to head over to the fullscreen app,

36
00:01:01,386 --> 00:01:03,728
and all the GIFs are located right here in the app.

37
00:01:03,728 --> 00:01:05,579
So I'm gonna scroll through, let's take a look.

38
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:06,618
They have a lot of GIFs.

39
00:01:06,618 --> 00:01:08,269
Okay, let's see what this one is here.

40
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:10,852
(funky music)

41
00:01:11,986 --> 00:01:13,712
Yes, okay this one's awesome.

42
00:01:13,712 --> 00:01:15,460
Alright, I'm definitely gonna try this one right now.

43
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,960
(funky music)

44
00:01:20,827 --> 00:01:22,398
Okay, that was fun, let's try another one right now.

45
00:01:22,398 --> 00:01:24,808
Let's see, yes, Adele.

46
00:01:24,808 --> 00:01:26,623
Hello from the other side, with a banana.

47
00:01:26,623 --> 00:01:28,156
Alright, cool, let's give this a shot.

48
00:01:28,156 --> 00:01:30,656
(funky music)

49
00:01:33,348 --> 00:01:34,743
Let's look for the next one here.

50
00:01:34,743 --> 00:01:35,576
Wait what was that?

51
00:01:35,576 --> 00:01:37,058
When you're waiting for a text from bae.

52
00:01:37,058 --> 00:01:39,504
Yup, I've been there, done that, let's try it.

53
00:01:39,504 --> 00:01:42,004
(funky music)

54
00:01:44,372 --> 00:01:45,254
Before we try this next one,

55
00:01:45,254 --> 00:01:47,004
if you guys wanna create your own custom GIFs

56
00:01:47,004 --> 00:01:48,443
from TV shows and movies

57
00:01:48,443 --> 00:01:49,452
I would love to see them.

58
00:01:49,452 --> 00:01:51,915

59
00:01:51,915 --> 00:01:53,163

72
00:02:14,153 --> 00:02:16,980

(funky music)

76
00:02:23,751 --> 00:02:26,039
(cart rattling)

77
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:27,613
Alright, this one here's gonna be the last one

79
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:29,778

00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,740
Yup, alright cool.

82
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,058
It's gonna be a lot of glass, it's gonna be nuts,

83
00:02:35,058 --> 00:02:37,141
but let's give it a shot.

84
00:02:38,028 --> 00:02:40,778
(dramatic music)

85
00:02:51,826 --> 00:02:53,344
(glass shattering)

86
00:02:53,344 --> 00:02:54,696
(glass shattering)

87
00:02:54,696 --> 00:02:57,613
