1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,261
- Here we go, (gasps and laughs).

2
00:00:04,261 --> 00:00:05,812
(t.v. best pattern beep) What's up, it's Collins Key,

3
00:00:05,812 --> 00:00:07,604
and welcome to the Thursday vlog.

4
00:00:07,604 --> 00:00:09,565
Now for today's video, I'm definitely stepping

5
00:00:09,565 --> 00:00:11,795
outside my comfort zone, just kinda going for it,

6
00:00:11,795 --> 00:00:14,313
and today I'm going to be tasting Mexican candy,

7
00:00:14,313 --> 00:00:15,556
and this is something that a lot of you guys

8
00:00:15,556 --> 00:00:16,645
have been asking me to do.

9
00:00:16,645 --> 00:00:18,064
I just got in my shipment of all

10
00:00:18,064 --> 00:00:19,127
my Mexican candy that I ordered.

11
00:00:19,127 --> 00:00:20,396
Oh my gosh, this is heavy.

12
00:00:20,396 --> 00:00:21,383
So yeah, there's a lot of different,

13
00:00:21,383 --> 00:00:23,735
crazy looking candies in here, like all this stuff.

14
00:00:23,735 --> 00:00:25,489
I'm also in a a huge giveaway on my channel right now

Without any further ado, I say we jump right in

29
00:00:52,709 --> 00:00:56,292
to the taste testing Mexican candies video.

30
00:00:57,251 --> 00:00:58,084
Seamless.

31
00:00:58,084 --> 00:00:59,469
All right to kick it off, I'm going to be starting

32
00:00:59,469 --> 00:01:02,330
with this one right here, and to be honest with you guys,

33
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:04,511
it kind of looks like poop on a spoon,

34
00:01:04,511 --> 00:01:07,032
so hopefully it tastes better than poop on a spoon.

35
00:01:07,032 --> 00:01:08,624
All right, so right off the bat these spoons...

36
00:01:08,624 --> 00:01:09,457
(bag falls)

37
00:01:09,457 --> 00:01:11,382
Oh well, (laughs) they're looking rather sketchy

38
00:01:11,382 --> 00:01:13,470
'cause they've got like this plastic bag on them

39
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,443
with a little rubber band, and then it's just stuff

40
00:01:15,443 --> 00:01:17,470
on a plastic spoon, so this is looking

41
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:18,470
rather (mumbles) right now.

42
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:19,554
(bag snaps)

43
00:01:19,554 --> 00:01:23,721
Okay, all right guys, so cheers, let's see how this goes.

44
00:01:26,933 --> 00:01:29,933
Hmm (lips smacking)

45
00:01:39,537 --> 00:01:41,679
It started off kinda good,

46
00:01:41,679 --> 00:01:43,940
and then (exhales), I don't know what happened.

47
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:47,107
Overall, it's not bad, but it's not...

48
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,360
It's not a favorite of mine, that's for sure,

49
00:01:55,867 --> 00:01:59,396
so let's whoo (laughs), there's some serious

50
00:01:59,396 --> 00:02:00,574
aftertaste in this one.

51
00:02:00,574 --> 00:02:01,790
Next up is something called Slaps.

52
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:04,329
So basically it's just like a lollipop.

53
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:05,300
It like a leaf.

54
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,133
It looks like a leaf lollipop.

55
00:02:06,133 --> 00:02:07,452
Now it is called a slap, so I guess I have

56
00:02:07,452 --> 00:02:08,859
to try it out, so let's see here.

57
00:02:08,859 --> 00:02:09,980
(slaps face) Ow!

58
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:12,679
I don't know how to do this (crunches candy).

59
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:15,179
Ho, wow, this is really crazy.

60
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:19,800
(laughs) I don't know how to eat this.

61
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,578
I don't know, ah, oh.

62
00:02:21,578 --> 00:02:22,411
They're actually not bad.

63
00:02:22,411 --> 00:02:24,478
They're kinda like green apple flavor

64
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:27,214
I guess you could say, but these are actually pretty good.

65
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:31,071
All right for this next one, I'm a little bit concerned.

66
00:02:31,071 --> 00:02:33,809
Don't even wanna comment (laughs) on what this looks like,

67
00:02:33,809 --> 00:02:35,317
but we're gonna open it up.

68
00:02:35,317 --> 00:02:36,408
This thing appears to be a pump,

69
00:02:36,408 --> 00:02:37,866
so I don't know if you're supposed to pump it

70
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:42,033
all in your mouth all at once, but we're gonna go for it.

71
00:02:43,024 --> 00:02:43,982
(gulps and gasps)

72
00:02:43,982 --> 00:02:46,854
(screeches)

73
00:02:46,854 --> 00:02:49,595
(exhales rapidly)

74
00:02:49,595 --> 00:02:51,595
(cries)

75
00:02:54,717 --> 00:02:56,967
(whimpers)

76
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,993
What on earth is this stuff?

77
00:03:05,584 --> 00:03:07,334
It's like spicy hmmm.

78
00:03:09,774 --> 00:03:13,502
It's got like this really bizarre aftertaste to it as well.

79
00:03:13,502 --> 00:03:14,508
So I really want to get that taste

80
00:03:14,508 --> 00:03:15,710
out of my mouth right now, so I'm going to try

81
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:18,063
these things right here, which they're green,

82
00:03:18,063 --> 00:03:20,841
and they look colorful, and there's a dude on them waving.

83
00:03:20,841 --> 00:03:21,674
Do you push like this?

84
00:03:21,674 --> 00:03:23,068
I think you have to take this off.

85
00:03:23,068 --> 00:03:23,901
How do you get this off?

86
00:03:23,901 --> 00:03:26,191
(jar clicks) There we go, all right.

87
00:03:26,191 --> 00:03:28,357
Hmm, so apparently if you push down like this,

88
00:03:28,357 --> 00:03:31,193
it's (laughs) what?

89
00:03:31,193 --> 00:03:33,692
Let's see (grunts).

90
00:03:33,692 --> 00:03:34,918
All right, so let's see here.

91
00:03:34,918 --> 00:03:39,085
On my gosh, look at this, it's just undulating out of it.

92
00:03:43,105 --> 00:03:44,188
So you know the stuff that I tried before,

93
00:03:44,188 --> 00:03:45,951
like the spoon stuff here?

94
00:03:45,951 --> 00:03:49,188
It seems like it's the exact same stuff.

95
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:50,931
Not a big fan overall of the taste of this stuff,

96
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:52,648
but overall it gets style points for just

97
00:03:52,648 --> 00:03:55,087
how fun it is to get out so whoo.

98
00:03:55,087 --> 00:03:56,091
So this little thing here, there's like

99
00:03:56,091 --> 00:03:57,761
a lemon dude on the outside, he's like this big,

100
00:03:57,761 --> 00:03:58,939
muscular guy going like this.

101
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:01,369
And then do you dump it in your mouth?

102
00:04:01,369 --> 00:04:02,670
I don't know.

103
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,420
We'll give it a shot.

104
00:04:06,105 --> 00:04:09,617
(inhales heavily)

105
00:04:09,617 --> 00:04:11,491
(spits loudly)

106
00:04:11,491 --> 00:04:14,100
It's look like for real in an emergency right now.

107
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,100
Woo hoo, it's like salt.

108
00:04:19,763 --> 00:04:21,164
It's like literally salt.

109
00:04:21,164 --> 00:04:25,865
Everything about me feels dry right now (smacks lips).

110
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:28,035
It's like I bit into 12 lemons at once.

111
00:04:28,035 --> 00:04:30,154
Next up is something called Tama Roca.

112
00:04:30,154 --> 00:04:31,866
Let's see, ooh wow.

113
00:04:31,866 --> 00:04:34,402
These are like massive lollipops it appears.

114
00:04:34,402 --> 00:04:35,235
That's kind of interesting.

115
00:04:35,235 --> 00:04:38,508
I'm gonna take a nibble of it first to give it a shot.

116
00:04:38,508 --> 00:04:40,591
That's weird, it's chewy.

117
00:04:41,524 --> 00:04:43,204
Yeah, you gotta take a bite out of it,

118
00:04:43,204 --> 00:04:45,041
so I like this one though.

119
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:47,200
This one's tasty, so this one gets a thumbs up.

120
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,033
I like it.

121
00:04:48,033 --> 00:04:49,425
So next up is this little one right here,

122
00:04:49,425 --> 00:04:50,258
and if you guys can see,

123
00:04:50,258 --> 00:04:51,487
it looks like a little pudding almost.

124
00:04:51,487 --> 00:04:53,404
Let's give this a shot.

125
00:04:54,955 --> 00:04:57,889
Hmmm, (laughs) I like this one a lot.

126
00:04:57,889 --> 00:04:59,491
Next up, I'm taking a big chance,

127
00:04:59,491 --> 00:05:02,221
and I'm going with another pump looking thing (laughs),

128
00:05:02,221 --> 00:05:03,956
and hopefully this tastes different.

129
00:05:03,956 --> 00:05:05,428
It's got a little squirt nozzle thing on it,

130
00:05:05,428 --> 00:05:08,511
so let's give this a shot, let's see.

131
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:13,892
Oh my God, (laughs).

132
00:05:13,892 --> 00:05:16,725
(exhales rapidly)

133
00:05:18,426 --> 00:05:21,343
Hmm, uh uh (gags).

134
00:05:24,216 --> 00:05:26,367
This is just like the spicier, more potent

135
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:27,532
version of this stuff.

136
00:05:27,532 --> 00:05:29,201
So I think as a general rule of thumb,

137
00:05:29,201 --> 00:05:31,192
anything that has a pump form on it,

138
00:05:31,192 --> 00:05:33,575
not for Collins, not for Collins (laughs).

139
00:05:33,575 --> 00:05:35,527
And now for the biggest bag of them all

140
00:05:35,527 --> 00:05:37,330
which basically just contains a whole bunch of little ones

141
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,125
in there but shh, no one has to know.

142
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:41,360
This is another push contraption, and it looks like

143
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,439
it's made out of the same turd looking fruit,

144
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:46,749
so it seems to be very popular, that turd looking fruit.

145
00:05:46,749 --> 00:05:51,371
It just tastes kinda crazy, kinda like a turd a little bit.

146
00:05:51,371 --> 00:05:53,748
Let's see, okay here we go.

147
00:05:53,748 --> 00:05:56,581
Ooh, yeah, no, no, hmm uh, huh uh.

148
00:05:57,536 --> 00:05:58,369
Don't, don't like it.

149
00:05:58,369 --> 00:06:00,298
I've saved the best for last, or in this case

150
00:06:00,298 --> 00:06:01,712
I think the most interesting for last.

151
00:06:01,712 --> 00:06:03,585
It's called Salsaghetti, and this appears

152
00:06:03,585 --> 00:06:05,228
to be a spaghetti candy.

153
00:06:05,228 --> 00:06:06,599
You've got the spaghetti noodles right here,

154
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:09,086
and then you have the sauce, and this sauce,

155
00:06:09,086 --> 00:06:11,700
and even on the packaging they have the sauce

156
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,302
coming out of one of the those pump contraptions

157
00:06:14,302 --> 00:06:16,933
(clears throat) that I love so very dearly.

158
00:06:16,933 --> 00:06:18,980
So let's give the Salsaghetti a shot.

159
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:22,359
We're gonna put the sauce on right now.

160
00:06:22,359 --> 00:06:24,835
Hmm, looks delicious.

161
00:06:24,835 --> 00:06:26,713
And I'm not really good when it comes to moderation,

162
00:06:26,713 --> 00:06:28,737
so instead of taking one noodle at a time,

163
00:06:28,737 --> 00:06:29,570
let's just go all the way,

164
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:30,403
we're going for all of them at once.

165
00:06:30,403 --> 00:06:31,320
Here we go.

166
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:37,173
Okay, (laughs)

167
00:06:39,012 --> 00:06:41,095
The noodles themselves...

168
00:06:42,474 --> 00:06:43,807
Okay, ugh, whoa.

169
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:47,506
Okay (laughs), so the noodles themselves are not bad.

170
00:06:47,506 --> 00:06:51,464
The sauce it just adds that extra hmmm,

171
00:06:51,464 --> 00:06:52,402
it's just like so powerful.

172
00:06:52,402 --> 00:06:56,518
It's very spicy, but ow (laughs), why did I do that?

173
00:06:56,518 --> 00:06:58,853
Forgot it was on my thumb, it's more of the sauce.

174
00:06:58,853 --> 00:06:59,690
My eyes are starting to water,

175
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,277
but yeah, that's it for this week's video.

176
00:07:01,277 --> 00:07:02,944
If you guys enjoyed me testing out

177
00:07:02,944 --> 00:07:04,258
all the different, crazy candies,

178
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:06,212
let me know by giving this video a big thumbs up,

179
00:07:06,212 --> 00:07:07,740
and also comment down below (laughs),

180
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,928
what are some other crazy candies,

181
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,900
or crazy foods you would love to have me try out

182
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,711
in an upcoming video, and share this video

183
00:07:12,711 --> 00:07:14,279
with your friends if you want me to make even more

184
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:16,862
of these testing out crazy foods and crazy products.

185
00:07:16,862 --> 00:07:18,662
And now I don't mean to offend anyone with this video.

186
00:07:18,662 --> 00:07:20,124
I know there's a lot of people out there

187
00:07:20,124 --> 00:07:21,941
who love these candies, just for me, I wasn't expecting

188
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:24,836
so much spiciness to be happening inside these

189
00:07:24,836 --> 00:07:27,064
seemingly sweet, innocent looking candies.

190
00:07:27,064 --> 00:07:28,150
Like I said, I'm doing a huge giveaway

191
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,065
on my channel right now.

192
00:07:29,065 --> 00:07:31,539
I'm giving away an iPhone, GoPro, Instax camera,

193
00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:33,089

00:07:33,089 --> 00:07:34,668
