1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,894
- Welcome back. - What's up?

2
00:00:00,894 --> 00:00:02,422
Yeah, or that, okay. (Gabbie laughs)

3
00:00:02,422 --> 00:00:03,526
What's up, it's Collins Key and welcome

4
00:00:03,526 --> 00:00:05,393
to my brand new video and today I'm here

5
00:00:05,393 --> 00:00:07,422
with the beautiful Gabbie Show,

6
00:00:07,422 --> 00:00:08,351
Aye, turn up.

7
00:00:08,351 --> 00:00:09,255
- Woah, woah.

8
00:00:09,255 --> 00:00:10,446
- So yeah, welcome to my channel.

9
00:00:10,446 --> 00:00:11,718
- Yay. - Good to have you.

10
00:00:11,718 --> 00:00:13,825
We have been meaning to do a video together

11
00:00:13,825 --> 00:00:16,194
for it's been like since the Demi tour right?

12
00:00:16,194 --> 00:00:17,027
- Yeah.

13
00:00:17,027 --> 00:00:18,026
- It's been a long time. - Wait, look how much

14
00:00:18,026 --> 00:00:19,298
tanner I am than you.

15
00:00:19,298 --> 00:00:20,833
- Okay, I tried tanning today.

16
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:22,192
Okay, I tried tanning today. - Did you?

17
00:00:22,192 --> 00:00:23,225
- Yeah, I got burned.

18
00:00:23,225 --> 00:00:25,086
And today, we're about to do a little battle.

19
00:00:25,086 --> 00:00:27,123
We're having a challenge, we're going head-to-head.

20
00:00:27,123 --> 00:00:29,456
We're gonna go a Viner versus YouTuber.

21
00:00:29,456 --> 00:00:31,006
We each prepared a list of questions,

22
00:00:31,006 --> 00:00:32,548
we're gonna go through them one by one

23
00:00:32,548 --> 00:00:35,062
and whoever answers the majority of the questions right,

24
00:00:35,062 --> 00:00:37,625
that person gets to hack the other's Twitter

25
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:39,120
at the end of this video.

26
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,150
So yeah, make sure you guys stick around

27
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,282
until the very end to find out what the crazy hack is

28
00:00:42,282 --> 00:00:43,998
and give this video a big thumbs up if you're excited

29
00:00:43,998 --> 00:00:45,444
to see this crazy trivia.

30
00:00:45,444 --> 00:00:47,047
So yeah, without further ado, let's get started.

31
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,886
- I have some really good questions for you.

32
00:00:48,886 --> 00:00:50,131
Just so you know, I'm gonna win.

33
00:00:50,131 --> 00:00:51,374
- Uh oh, uh oh.

34
00:00:51,374 --> 00:00:52,619
Guests get to go first on the channel,

35
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:54,108
that's how it works.

36
00:00:54,108 --> 00:00:56,819
- With me when it's my channel, I just do whatever I want.

37
00:00:56,819 --> 00:00:57,967
(laughs loudly)

38
00:00:57,967 --> 00:01:00,202
- Well, I have to show a little bit of chivalry here, okay.

39
00:01:00,202 --> 00:01:02,258
- What did crack kid get hit in the head with?

40
00:01:02,258 --> 00:01:03,115
- A basketball.

41
00:01:03,115 --> 00:01:03,948
(Gabbie scoffs)

42
00:01:03,948 --> 00:01:05,456
I love that Vine. (Gabbie laughs)

43
00:01:05,456 --> 00:01:06,289
Yas!

44
00:01:06,289 --> 00:01:07,219
- Yah!

45
00:01:07,219 --> 00:01:09,300
- I hope you have a shovel girl question in there.

46
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,133
- I don't. - Like what color

47
00:01:10,133 --> 00:01:11,070
was her shirt or something.

48
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,622
- All right, well point Collins.

49
00:01:12,622 --> 00:01:14,921
- Aye, turn up, you got the S.

50
00:01:14,921 --> 00:01:15,935
- Well, of course.

51
00:01:15,935 --> 00:01:17,554
- You have no idea how many people

52
00:01:17,554 --> 00:01:19,108
mess with the S. - Really?

53
00:01:19,108 --> 00:01:19,941
- Oh, yeah.

54
00:01:19,941 --> 00:01:22,003
So before hoverboards, what did every YouTuber

55
00:01:22,003 --> 00:01:22,836
ride around on?

56
00:01:22,836 --> 00:01:24,840
That's not like regular scooters, right?

57
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,309
Okay, is it? - No. (laughs loudly)

58
00:01:27,309 --> 00:01:29,638
- This was before I was popular. (Collins laughs)

59
00:01:29,638 --> 00:01:30,471
You're killing me, Smalls.

60
00:01:30,471 --> 00:01:31,979
Is it a scooter of some type? - No.

61
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:33,380
- It's not a scooter? - No, it's a Penny board.

62
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,102
- What the heck is Penny board?

63
00:01:35,102 --> 00:01:38,308
- A Penny board, they're like little mini skateboards.

64
00:01:38,308 --> 00:01:39,141
I think it started with like

65
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:41,024
all the British YouTubers, like they all

66
00:01:41,024 --> 00:01:41,857
got Penny boards. - I've never heard

67
00:01:41,857 --> 00:01:42,690
that in my life.

68
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:43,754
- Comment down below and name some YouTubers

69
00:01:43,754 --> 00:01:46,884
that you guys know for sure rode Penny boards 24/7.

70
00:01:46,884 --> 00:01:48,250
Okay, now it's your turn.

71
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,277
- So zero for me.

72
00:01:49,277 --> 00:01:50,110
- Yep.

73
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:50,943
- Dang it.

74
00:01:50,943 --> 00:01:51,992
Finish this sentence.

75
00:01:51,992 --> 00:01:52,825
- Uh oh.

76
00:01:52,825 --> 00:01:53,967
- If you want a french fry.

77
00:01:53,967 --> 00:01:55,131
- Oh yeah, eat a french fry.

78
00:01:55,131 --> 00:01:57,829
If you want a burger, eat a burger.

79
00:01:57,829 --> 00:01:59,121
(laughs loudly)

80
00:01:59,121 --> 00:02:01,579
What is the most disliked video on YouTube?

81
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:03,057
- Your board, I'm just kidding.

82
00:02:03,057 --> 00:02:06,039
(laughs loudly)

83
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:07,558
I don't know any of these.

84
00:02:07,558 --> 00:02:09,099
You were like, "Oh, give me some easy ones

85
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:09,932
"that I can answer."

86
00:02:09,932 --> 00:02:10,765
- No, I wanted hard ones,

87
00:02:10,765 --> 00:02:11,873
I wanted hard ones. - Most disliked video?

88
00:02:11,873 --> 00:02:12,942
You told me you wanted easy ones.

89
00:02:12,942 --> 00:02:14,133
- No, I want some hard ones.

90
00:02:14,133 --> 00:02:15,620
- Oh, you're a cheater mcgeeter.

91
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,285
- No, what is this?

92
00:02:17,285 --> 00:02:19,423
Oh my god, I grabbed it. - It's a Finn doll. (laughs)

93
00:02:19,423 --> 00:02:21,053
- I'm like what is poking in my back.

94
00:02:21,053 --> 00:02:22,100
- It's Finn the Human.

95
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,817
- Think about it, it needs a lot of views

96
00:02:23,817 --> 00:02:25,395
on this video to get a lot--

97
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:26,663
- Justin Bieber.

98
00:02:26,663 --> 00:02:27,996
- Which one?

99
00:02:27,996 --> 00:02:28,829
- Is it Baby?

100
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:29,662
- Yeah.

101
00:02:29,662 --> 00:02:31,386
- Baby has the most dislikes? - Yeah, the most disliked

102
00:02:31,386 --> 00:02:32,743
video on YouTube, which is sad.

103
00:02:32,743 --> 00:02:34,095
- Is it the most liked video on YouTube as well?

104
00:02:34,095 --> 00:02:35,678
- I don't think so.

105
00:02:35,678 --> 00:02:37,480
I don't know. - Baby, little Baby.

106
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,813
- I know.

107
00:02:38,813 --> 00:02:39,758
It's pretty sad.

108
00:02:39,758 --> 00:02:41,612
- Who has the most loops on Vine?

109
00:02:41,612 --> 00:02:43,491
- Oh, I think I know this one.

110
00:02:43,491 --> 00:02:45,164
Is it Lele Pons?

111
00:02:45,164 --> 00:02:47,413
(Gabbie groans) Yeah, did I get it?

112
00:02:47,413 --> 00:02:49,671
I'm acing this so far. - You Googled, I'm asking

113
00:02:49,671 --> 00:02:51,537
the obvious questions. - No, I did not, I promise.

114
00:02:51,537 --> 00:02:52,370
I did not. - This is my fault.

115
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:53,203
I did this.

116
00:02:53,203 --> 00:02:54,277
- So every year YouTube does a video

117
00:02:54,277 --> 00:02:56,196
where they recap what happened that year.

118
00:02:56,196 --> 00:02:57,701
What is this video called?

119
00:02:57,701 --> 00:02:58,774
- Oh my god, stop.

120
00:02:58,774 --> 00:03:00,857
That's a really good one.

121
00:03:01,701 --> 00:03:03,267
I don't know, I'm not even gonna try.

122
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:05,275
I can't even try. - You can't even try?

123
00:03:05,275 --> 00:03:06,661
- It's like one of those things that you click it

124
00:03:06,661 --> 00:03:07,494
and you know what it is,

125
00:03:07,494 --> 00:03:09,744
but like I never remember. - Yeah, it's YouTube Rewind.

126
00:03:09,744 --> 00:03:11,990
- Why was I gonna say that, or I was gonna say Replay?

127
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:14,402
♫ Shawty's like a melody in my head

128
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:15,300
♫ That I can't keep out

129
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,308
♫ Got me singing like

130
00:03:16,308 --> 00:03:17,989
♫ Na na na na everyday

131
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:19,996
♫ Got my mind (mumbles) replay

132
00:03:19,996 --> 00:03:20,829
- Yeah!

133
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:21,828
We started off strong and then it dipped

134
00:03:21,828 --> 00:03:22,854
and then we got right back into it.

135
00:03:22,854 --> 00:03:23,731
That was good.

136
00:03:23,731 --> 00:03:25,046
- Don't drop what?

137
00:03:25,046 --> 00:03:26,134
- That thun thun thun.

138
00:03:26,134 --> 00:03:27,133
- (sighs) Too easy.

139
00:03:27,133 --> 00:03:28,168
- You can go for another one, that one was easy.

140
00:03:28,168 --> 00:03:29,053
- Okay, that was dumb.

141
00:03:29,053 --> 00:03:30,490
We're not gonna count that, that was just a bonus round.

142
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:31,640
- Yeah, a really quick bonus.

143
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,599
- How do you block out the haters?

144
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:36,369
- With the spoons over your eyes.

145
00:03:36,369 --> 00:03:37,202
- (sighs) Collins. - And you're like,

146
00:03:37,202 --> 00:03:38,793
"Mmm, blocking out the haters."

147
00:03:38,793 --> 00:03:42,129
What was the first YouTube video ever posted?

148
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:45,565
- Wait, I know this. (Collins laughs)

149
00:03:45,565 --> 00:03:47,842
Now watch me whip. (laughs)

150
00:03:47,842 --> 00:03:49,466
- Okay, do you wanna know what the answer is?

151
00:03:49,466 --> 00:03:50,299
- Yeah.

152
00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:51,722
- The answer is Me at the zoo.

153
00:03:51,722 --> 00:03:53,004
- Okay, I did not know that. - It was like some dude

154
00:03:53,004 --> 00:03:53,898
at the zoo with an elephant and he was like,

155
00:03:53,898 --> 00:03:55,534
"Aye, it's an elephant."

156
00:03:55,534 --> 00:03:56,744
And it was just kinda like, "What?"

157
00:03:56,744 --> 00:03:57,577
- And that's what he uploaded?

158
00:03:57,577 --> 00:03:58,690
That's like Vine now. - That was the very first.

159
00:03:58,690 --> 00:03:59,851
(laughs loudly)

160
00:03:59,851 --> 00:04:02,101
- Who on Vine hates sauces?

161
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:05,095
- Okay, this is so hard.

162
00:04:05,095 --> 00:04:06,959
- This is a hard one, but not if you know Vine,

163
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:07,792
if you know it.

164
00:04:07,792 --> 00:04:08,625
- Can I have like

165
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:09,634
a little hint? - Sauces!

166
00:04:09,634 --> 00:04:10,467
- Sauces!

167
00:04:11,478 --> 00:04:12,936
- Who do you think videos it?

168
00:04:12,936 --> 00:04:14,195
- I have no idea.

169
00:04:14,195 --> 00:04:15,960
- Look at all these sauces!

170
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,319
- Sauces!

171
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:20,945
- I actually thought I knew Vine, I've never--

172
00:04:20,945 --> 00:04:22,037
- Are you pretending to not know to make

173
00:04:22,037 --> 00:04:23,676
me feel better? - No, I actually have no idea

174
00:04:23,676 --> 00:04:24,918
who this is.

175
00:04:24,918 --> 00:04:26,801
- Um, Marcus Johns.

176
00:04:26,801 --> 00:04:28,329
He had like a whole series about like,

177
00:04:28,329 --> 00:04:30,774
"Look at all these sauces."

178
00:04:30,774 --> 00:04:31,607
- Sauces!

179
00:04:31,607 --> 00:04:32,842
- I got a point finally.

180
00:04:32,842 --> 00:04:34,500
- What is the type of video where YouTubers talk

181
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,818
about their life story?

182
00:04:35,818 --> 00:04:36,651
- Draw my life.

183
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:37,650
- Yes, that's it, yep.

184
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,626
(exclaims loudly)

185
00:04:39,626 --> 00:04:40,961
(laughs)

186
00:04:40,961 --> 00:04:42,859
- Who was the first Viner to hit a million?

187
00:04:42,859 --> 00:04:43,692
- Was it Nash?

188
00:04:43,692 --> 00:04:44,775
- No.

189
00:04:44,775 --> 00:04:46,607
Oh my god, no.

190
00:04:46,607 --> 00:04:47,593
Not even close.

191
00:04:47,593 --> 00:04:48,426
- Okay, I don't know.

192
00:04:48,426 --> 00:04:49,674
Was it like Marcus Johns?

193
00:04:49,674 --> 00:04:50,917
- Marcus was the one, yeah.

194
00:04:50,917 --> 00:04:51,750
- Okay, here's a quick one.

195
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,343
How old is YouTube?

196
00:04:53,343 --> 00:04:54,881
- I know this for 100% fact.

197
00:04:54,881 --> 00:04:57,242
It is, pause, wait.

198
00:04:57,242 --> 00:04:58,450
15?

199
00:04:58,450 --> 00:04:59,330
- 15 years?

200
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,980
- No. - No, they're 10 years old.

201
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:02,813
2005.

202
00:05:02,813 --> 00:05:05,113
- I swear to god I knew that because that was the year

203
00:05:05,113 --> 00:05:06,538
I started dating my first boyfriend

204
00:05:06,538 --> 00:05:08,225
and in my head that was 15 years ago,

205
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:10,990
but I knew it was 2005 so give me that point.

206
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:11,876
I need it, come on.

207
00:05:11,876 --> 00:05:14,009
- Okay fine, I don't know what just happened,

208
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:15,904
but you get a point right now. - I knew it was the year.

209
00:05:15,904 --> 00:05:18,285
Who is the prettiest girl on Vine?

210
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:19,690
- Oh, this one's so easy.

211
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:22,770
It is the Gabbie Show, hands down. (Gabbie laughs)

212
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:24,193
Of course, of course.

213
00:05:24,193 --> 00:05:26,986
Like I'm blushing sitting next to her right now.

214
00:05:26,986 --> 00:05:28,588
- I thought you were gonna go, "Oh my god,

215
00:05:28,588 --> 00:05:30,274
"that's so obvious, it's Lele Pons."

216
00:05:30,274 --> 00:05:32,243
- No, I would actually say you, of course, yeah.

217
00:05:32,243 --> 00:05:34,175
- Awe. - Because you're gorgeous.

218
00:05:34,175 --> 00:05:37,108
- Who was known as the Squirrel Whisperer?

219
00:05:37,108 --> 00:05:39,564
- Oh my god, I think I know what these are,

220
00:05:39,564 --> 00:05:40,765
but I'm not.

221
00:05:40,765 --> 00:05:43,596
Oh, Jerome, is it Jerome?

222
00:05:43,596 --> 00:05:45,979
- Come on, he's the Squirrel Whisperer.

223
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:49,019
- I had no idea, but I remembered one selfie he took

224
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:51,994
on like Twitter with a squirrel and I love squirrels

225
00:05:51,994 --> 00:05:55,481
so I was so jealous that he somehow talked to a squirrel,

226
00:05:55,481 --> 00:05:56,314
like could make it

227
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:57,147
take a selfie. - Whatever.

228
00:05:57,147 --> 00:05:58,504
- So this is the final question.

229
00:05:58,504 --> 00:06:01,512
Name one hidden Easter egg in the YouTube website.

230
00:06:01,512 --> 00:06:02,617
- Can I Google it?

231
00:06:02,617 --> 00:06:03,984
- No. (Gabbie laughs)

232
00:06:03,984 --> 00:06:04,936
That's so cheating, what?

233
00:06:04,936 --> 00:06:06,503
- See, this is how small my capacity

234
00:06:06,503 --> 00:06:08,730
for irrelevant information is.

235
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,046
- Irrelevant? - Like it's in and I enjoy it

236
00:06:10,046 --> 00:06:10,879
and it's great and it's gone.

237
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:11,712
Like the Easter egg--

238
00:06:11,712 --> 00:06:13,102
- Easter eggs are freaking awesome, they're like

239
00:06:13,102 --> 00:06:14,087
my favorite things. - They're awesome,

240
00:06:14,087 --> 00:06:15,851
but do you need to keep them in your mind?

241
00:06:15,851 --> 00:06:17,057
- Absolutely for moments like this

242
00:06:17,057 --> 00:06:18,304
when your challenging me.

243
00:06:18,304 --> 00:06:20,437
♫ For a moment like this

244
00:06:20,437 --> 00:06:21,895
- What is it?

245
00:06:21,895 --> 00:06:22,728
- Well, there's a couple.

246
00:06:22,728 --> 00:06:23,985
Like one is Use the Force, Luke.

247
00:06:23,985 --> 00:06:26,020
If you type in like Harlem Shake, then all the videos

248
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,314
do the Harlem Shake and just cool stuff like that.

249
00:06:28,314 --> 00:06:29,596
- I didn't know about any of those.

250
00:06:29,596 --> 00:06:31,406
I just want to see one of them.

251
00:06:31,406 --> 00:06:33,343
Oh my god, I'm so excited I'm gonna die.

252
00:06:33,343 --> 00:06:35,196
(Harlem Shake music)

253
00:06:35,196 --> 00:06:36,029
Oh my god.

254
00:06:38,672 --> 00:06:41,211
(Gabbie laughs)

255
00:06:41,211 --> 00:06:42,044
I love it.

256
00:06:44,415 --> 00:06:45,406
- Stop it.

257
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:46,639
- Oh wait, okay.

258
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,732
I don't know how to make it stop,

259
00:06:47,732 --> 00:06:49,868
there's no pause button, oh god.

260
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:52,763
Wow. (Collins laughs)

261
00:06:52,763 --> 00:06:55,922
A tornado flew around my-- - No, a potato.

262
00:06:55,922 --> 00:06:57,380
See? - A potato, dang it.

263
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,715
- Vine reference, I just made a Vine reference.

264
00:06:59,715 --> 00:07:04,003
- [Viner] A potato flew around my room before you came.

265
00:07:04,003 --> 00:07:05,804
- Clearly you won, Collins.

266
00:07:05,804 --> 00:07:07,813
- Yeah, so that was kind of a landslide, but you were

267
00:07:07,813 --> 00:07:09,575
a great sport about it. - A landslide?

268
00:07:09,575 --> 00:07:10,801
- You were a great sport about it.

269
00:07:10,801 --> 00:07:11,634
- Rude.

270
00:07:11,634 --> 00:07:13,080
- Stick around to see what the tweet is

271
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,244
that I'm about to hack her with.

272
00:07:14,244 --> 00:07:15,645
I'm gonna post it in just a little bit,

273
00:07:15,645 --> 00:07:16,902
but for right now make sure you guys give this video

274
00:07:16,902 --> 00:07:19,468
a big thumbs up and also comment down below

275
00:07:19,468 --> 00:07:21,625
how many of these questions did you know

276
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:23,594
and also what's some other random trivia

277
00:07:23,594 --> 00:07:25,368
about Vine or YouTube that you think

278
00:07:25,368 --> 00:07:26,924
we have no idea. - I need schooling,

279
00:07:26,924 --> 00:07:27,757
I need schooling.

280
00:07:27,757 --> 00:07:29,248
- Make sure you guys check out the Gabbie Show

281
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:31,158
on her channel because we just did a video over there

282
00:07:31,158 --> 00:07:33,464
where we did a Halloween What's in my Mouth? Challenge.

283
00:07:33,464 --> 00:07:35,031
- It's really gross.

284
00:07:35,031 --> 00:07:37,286
- I don't even know what happened there. (Gabbie laughs)

285
00:07:37,286 --> 00:07:39,086
You guys just have to go watch the video right now

286
00:07:39,086 --> 00:07:40,504
because things got crazy.

287
00:07:40,504 --> 00:07:42,032
Now, it's time to announce the keeper of the week

288
00:07:42,032 --> 00:07:44,990
and this was actually inspired by this girl right here,

289
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,902
the Gabbie Show, because she has a showstopper of the week,

290
00:07:46,902 --> 00:07:49,671
but my keeper of the week is Stephanie Keeper

291
00:07:49,671 --> 00:07:52,132
and you are on Instagram, you are always going so hard,

292
00:07:52,132 --> 00:07:54,176
I see you all the time and I want to say a big shout-out

293
00:07:54,176 --> 00:07:56,126
to all my super active Instagram accounts

294
00:07:56,126 --> 00:07:57,461
because you guys make me smile so much

295
00:07:57,461 --> 00:07:58,467
like whenever I go to tag photos,

296
00:07:58,467 --> 00:08:00,988
you guys are always posting the coolest edits ever.

297
00:08:00,988 --> 00:08:02,090
So shout-out to all of you.

298
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,867
And I'm gonna feature more of the Instagram fan accounts

299
00:08:03,867 --> 00:08:05,535
in upcoming videos so if you guys want

300
00:08:05,535 --> 00:08:07,103
to be the keeper of the week, all you have to do

301
00:08:07,103 --> 00:08:09,344
is just be super active on Instagram, on Twitter,

302
00:08:09,344 --> 00:08:11,754
on YouTube sharing my videos, liking, commenting.

303
00:08:11,754 --> 00:08:12,926
Basically the more active you are,

304
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:14,420
the better chance that you have of being

305
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,655
the keeper of the week, but again,

306
00:08:15,655 --> 00:08:17,723
congratulations, Stephanie, I love you.

307
00:08:17,723 --> 00:08:20,642
- And here is the tweet is that Collins decided

308
00:08:20,642 --> 00:08:23,223
to share with all of my followers.

309
00:08:23,223 --> 00:08:24,058
- Cheese.

310
00:08:24,058 --> 00:08:25,384
Boom, and now it's gone, but if you guys

311
00:08:25,384 --> 00:08:26,731

mine is right here.

315
00:08:31,242 --> 00:08:33,164
Bye. (snaps fingers)

316
00:08:33,164 --> 00:08:35,110
- Collins, where'd you go?

317
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,171
- Aye. (Gabbie screams)

318
00:08:36,171 --> 00:08:37,104
Do the Harlem Shake.
