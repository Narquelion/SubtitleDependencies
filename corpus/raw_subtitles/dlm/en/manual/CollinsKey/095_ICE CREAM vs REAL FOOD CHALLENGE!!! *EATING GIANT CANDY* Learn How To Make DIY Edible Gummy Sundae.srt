1
00:00:00,537 --> 00:00:01,590
(screaming excitedly) - Oh no!

2
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:02,540
You challenged us to make

3
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:05,020
the craziest ice cream sundae of all-time,

4
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:05,853
and we're kicking it off right now

5
00:00:05,853 --> 00:00:06,750
with the first ingredient.

6
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:07,583
You ready?

7
00:00:07,583 --> 00:00:08,728
Three, two, one!

8
00:00:08,728 --> 00:00:10,530
Yay!

9
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:11,363
- Whoa, what?

10
00:00:11,363 --> 00:00:12,210
- Oh yeah, I forgot to mention,

11
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:13,578
one of 'em is the delicious ice cream,

12
00:00:13,578 --> 00:00:16,040
and the other one is Spam,

13
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:16,979
or something gross. - Wait, Spam?

14
00:00:16,979 --> 00:00:17,857
(sinister laughter)

15
00:00:17,857 --> 00:00:19,297
So here we go! - Dude.

16
00:00:19,297 --> 00:00:20,771
What?! - Oh!

17
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:21,977
- We just went through this! - I missed!

18
00:00:21,977 --> 00:00:23,299
So now, kind of mix it all up.

19
00:00:23,299 --> 00:00:25,966
(sensual music)

20
00:00:27,342 --> 00:00:28,728
- Yo! This is now

21
00:00:28,728 --> 00:00:31,824
(incoherent screaming)

22
00:00:31,824 --> 00:00:33,866
(gagging)

23
00:00:33,866 --> 00:00:35,093
- You good?

24
00:00:35,093 --> 00:00:35,926
- Yeah I'm good.

25
00:00:35,926 --> 00:00:37,101
This is so good!

26
00:00:37,101 --> 00:00:40,050
(screaming)

27
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,467
- Oh, oh oh wait! Can I sprinkle some in?

28
00:00:44,409 --> 00:00:45,242
(mumbles)

29
00:00:45,242 --> 00:00:47,124
- We didn't clean the table before this bro!

30
00:00:47,124 --> 00:00:49,374
(mumbling)

31
00:00:50,294 --> 00:00:51,370
- Here we go.

32
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:52,203
Wait I need some too!

33
00:00:52,203 --> 00:00:56,450
- There is the first ingredient of my super ice cream sundae

34
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:58,560
and now time to eat yo spam.

35
00:00:59,673 --> 00:01:00,590
- Oh! - Oh!

36
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:03,417
- That smells so gross!

37
00:01:03,417 --> 00:01:06,280
- I tried my best to get as many sprinkles as I could.

38
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,440
- Oh! And they all dumped off.

39
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:11,783
- Don't say...

40
00:01:11,783 --> 00:01:13,330
- Sorry, sorry, hold

41
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:14,420
- I'm just getting the bowl ready.

42
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,180
Alright three, two, one

43
00:01:18,805 --> 00:01:20,154
(coughing)

44
00:01:20,154 --> 00:01:21,670
- You can't do that!

45
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:24,826
Okay fine, I'll put the rest of the thing in there bro.

46
00:01:24,826 --> 00:01:26,106
- This is the one

47
00:01:26,106 --> 00:01:27,069
Yeet!

48
00:01:27,069 --> 00:01:28,082
(buzzer )

49
00:01:28,082 --> 00:01:29,200
Yeet!

50
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,250
(buzzer) Oh my gosh.

51
00:01:31,796 --> 00:01:32,890
Ow!

52
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:34,580
There we go, okay great.

53
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,850
Now guys, we're on to the next round.

54
00:01:37,689 --> 00:01:38,522
(evil laughing)

55
00:01:38,522 --> 00:01:40,640
This round, Devin, do you want to keep em or stitch em?

56
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,550
- You know what? I can feel some cold emanating

57
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,550
from the top of this so I'm gonna keep it.

58
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:46,990
- Oh man, okay here we go.

59
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:48,000
- Three, two, one

60
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
- Yeah! - No!

61
00:01:50,521 --> 00:01:51,604
I got wasabi!

62
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:54,690
- I got salted caramel cluster.

63
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:55,820
- And I gotta eat wasabi.

64
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,653
- Yeah you do.

65
00:01:56,653 --> 00:01:58,000
Alright, I'll just go for it.

66
00:02:00,091 --> 00:02:01,101
That's so good!

67
00:02:01,101 --> 00:02:03,145
The caramel mixed with the chocolate

68
00:02:03,145 --> 00:02:05,210
mixed with the saltedness.

69
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,158
- Yeet. - So good.

70
00:02:06,158 --> 00:02:07,789
- Here we go. Time for some wasabi.

71
00:02:07,789 --> 00:02:08,768
Oh, I'm not looking forward to this.

72
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:10,530
Three, two, one

73
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:11,363
- Wait!

74
00:02:11,363 --> 00:02:12,793

You ready for this?

78
00:02:19,483 --> 00:02:21,795
Five, four, three

00:02:21,795 --> 00:02:24,360

00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:26,620
were able to do that.

82
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,960
And right now, it's time for some wasabi.

83
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,340
Here we go three, two, one

84
00:02:32,691 --> 00:02:34,858
(screams)

85
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,888
- Better or worse than last time?

86
00:02:37,888 --> 00:02:39,600
- Way worse!

87
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,710
- Did you add it?

88
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:41,543
- Oh!

89
00:02:42,843 --> 00:02:43,676
Okay guys!

90
00:02:43,676 --> 00:02:45,485
(screams)

91
00:02:45,485 --> 00:02:46,765
- [Collins] Okay guys, next round, let's go!

92
00:02:46,765 --> 00:02:49,140
- Collins, do you want to keep it or switch it?

93
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,160
- I'm feeling spontaneous.

94
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,120
We're gonna switch it right now, here we go.

95
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,749
Three, two, one

96
00:02:53,749 --> 00:02:54,660
- Yeah! - No!

97
00:02:55,973 --> 00:02:56,806
Woo!

98
00:02:58,223 --> 00:03:00,642
- Yo, bro, mediterranean mint!

99
00:03:00,642 --> 00:03:01,539
(slurps)

100
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:02,396
What did you get?

101
00:03:02,396 --> 00:03:03,360
(cough)

102
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,180
- [Collins] You got clam bro! And clam juice!

103
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,013
- Oh!

104
00:03:07,013 --> 00:03:08,091
- The juice of a clam!

105
00:03:08,091 --> 00:03:11,170
- Yo! Just the color of it!

106
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:12,003
- How is it?

107
00:03:12,003 --> 00:03:12,836
- Love.

108
00:03:12,836 --> 00:03:13,669
- Yeah?

109
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,310
- This is by far the greatest ice cream

110
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,340
I've had to date.

111
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,250
- Don't rub it in bro.

112
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,527
- Just the freshness of the mintiness and whatever is

113
00:03:21,527 --> 00:03:24,181
Mediterranean about it just makes it feel like you can just

114
00:03:24,181 --> 00:03:26,013
you know, mediterranean.

115
00:03:26,013 --> 00:03:26,846
You know what I mean?

116
00:03:26,846 --> 00:03:27,679
- No!

117
00:03:27,679 --> 00:03:30,104
- It's time for you to eat your clams.

118
00:03:30,104 --> 00:03:31,794
- That was bad.

119
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,128
- Yeah, that was really bad.

120
00:03:33,128 --> 00:03:35,880
Does anyone just straight up drink clam juice?

121
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,465
- I'm already queazy.

122
00:03:38,465 --> 00:03:42,408
- Oh! Dude you're splashing it everywhere!

123
00:03:42,408 --> 00:03:43,850
- I, ah okay.

124
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,010
Here we go three, two, one

125
00:03:51,179 --> 00:03:52,560
(laughs) - Oh the faces.

126
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,109
You guys, screenshot and like tag him.

127
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:55,780
- No! Uh no! - Yes!

128
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,800
And you gotta get your clam juice.

129
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,633
- No!

130
00:03:57,633 --> 00:03:59,210
- [Collins] This is gonna be the most delicious

131
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:00,940
ice cream sundae of all time.

132
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,100
So Devin, you get to choose.

133
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,810
You wanna keep em or switch em?

134
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:04,877
- The top is cold again, I'm keeping it!

135
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:05,710
- No!

136
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,387
- Three, two, one

137
00:04:07,387 --> 00:04:09,320
- Yeah!

138
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,300
- Oh gosh no, dude, I got Kimchi!

139
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,600
- It's gonna smell so bad!

140
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,490
- Yeah man!

141
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:16,280
- Oh man, chunky monkey.

142
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:18,830
Alright, time to eat it.

143
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,266
Mm, wow.

144
00:04:20,266 --> 00:04:21,750
- Oh no!

145
00:04:23,415 --> 00:04:24,743
- It's like, hissing and fizzling!

146
00:04:24,743 --> 00:04:26,861
- It smells so bad!

147
00:04:26,861 --> 00:04:28,280
(screams)

148
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,582
- [Collins] What is going on, no!

149
00:04:29,582 --> 00:04:31,550
No no no, go back!

150
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:34,620
How do you think that fit in there?

151
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,610
Who packaged this?

152
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:36,850
I'm like, covered in Kimchi.

153
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,010
Dude, it's still bubbling.

154
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:39,790
How is it still rising to the top?

155
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:42,040
Where is it all coming from? It was in a jar.

156
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,190
I don't understand the physics or science of this.

157
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,630
Oh man, it's going everywhere.

158
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,700
It looks like a cabbage.

159
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,990
I gotta calm it down and just enjoy Kimchi.

160
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,590
I mean, clearly it's being sold.

161
00:04:54,337 --> 00:04:57,051
- Oh, I feel so bad right now.

162
00:04:57,051 --> 00:04:58,512
What?

163
00:04:58,512 --> 00:04:59,930
It doesn't look like you're enjoying it!

164
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,640
Nobody does that when they enjoy stuff.

165
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,900
I've never had the ice cream and was like

166
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,870
"Oh yeah, it's so good,"

167
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,352
I can see through your facade dude.

168
00:05:06,352 --> 00:05:08,402
Well you gotta shake it harder than that.

169
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:13,370
They packed that thing in so well.

170
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,060
- Next round, let's go.

171
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,850
- Alright Collins, it's your turn.

172
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:19,840
Do you wanna keep it or switch it?

173
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,990
- Yo, I wanna switch it.

174
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,660
- You wanna switch it, alright.

175
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:23,493
- Sike! We're keeping it!

176
00:05:23,493 --> 00:05:24,326
- No, why?

177
00:05:24,326 --> 00:05:25,980
- I dunno, I just wanna mess with your emotions.

178
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:28,000
Three, two, one

179
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:30,598
- Ah! - No!

180
00:05:30,598 --> 00:05:32,640
- You gotta eat a raw egg bro.

181
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,473
- Uh, I don't think so.

182
00:05:33,473 --> 00:05:34,635
- Alright, now all you need it a glass.

183
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:37,070
(claps)

184
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:40,188
Dude, I got Cherry Garcia, the third most popular flavor.

185
00:05:40,188 --> 00:05:43,160
Yeet!

186
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,220
- Ah, perfect. - That looks gross!

187
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,310
- So I guess I'll take a bite of mine first, no!

188
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,143
- Yeah!

189
00:05:48,143 --> 00:05:49,350
- Dude, do you know how disgusting

190
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,860
the outside of an eggshell is?

191
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:51,693
- Oh.

192
00:05:51,693 --> 00:05:52,690
- I can't believe you've done this!

193
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:53,657
Off sides violation.

194
00:05:53,657 --> 00:05:55,660
You have to do two eggs now.

195
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,493
- What?

196
00:05:56,493 --> 00:05:57,890
- Two eggs for how you messed up mine.

197
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:00,200
Don't you ever put your shell in my sundae again.

198
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,860
This is so frozen, the spoon isn't cutting through.

199
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,349
I gotta warm it up in my mouth.

200
00:06:03,349 --> 00:06:04,968
(laughs)

201
00:06:04,968 --> 00:06:08,510
Trick shot time. Three, two, one

202
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,470
- That worked out.

203
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,303
- Oh!

204
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:11,270
Three, two, one

205
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,930
- No! No, you can't do it swooping towards me.

206
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:13,763
I feel so ner,

207
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,720
- Man! I'm just gonna take a bite this time.

208
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,260
- When will you learn just to eat it?

209
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,300
- Oh my god, ow.

210
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,990
- Yeah, I know.

211
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,930
- Gotta have more!

212
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,700
- That's way too much dude.

213
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:30,600
I saw some smoke fly out cause, you know, it's so cold.

214
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,780
You look like a little fish.

215
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,000
- Ah, that was delicious!

216
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,910
Now time for you to drink your egg, Devin.

217
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:36,190
- I think we should just move on.

218
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,023
- I don't think so.

219
00:06:37,023 --> 00:06:38,051
Three, two, one

220
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:40,612
No, wait wait wait.

221
00:06:40,612 --> 00:06:41,445
First, three second like challenge.

222
00:06:41,445 --> 00:06:44,590
We wanna see if you can like this video in three seconds.

223
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:49,400
You ready? Here we go. Three, two, one done!

224
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,625
Alright Devin, time for you to drink it.

225
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:52,020
- I'm super nervous.

226
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:52,853
Alright, here we go.

227
00:06:52,853 --> 00:06:53,944
Three, two, one

228
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:00,246
(gags)

229
00:07:00,246 --> 00:07:01,079
- [Collins] Oh no!

230
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:02,107
Alright, we'll get the other one in there.

231
00:07:02,107 --> 00:07:03,220
Woop, nice.

232
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,991
And we'll be making these up, coming up here very shortly

233
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:07,670
and eating it all but right now we are on

234
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:08,642
to the next round.

235
00:07:08,642 --> 00:07:09,475
- Finally.

236
00:07:09,475 --> 00:07:10,586
- So, Devin, it's your turn now.

237
00:07:10,586 --> 00:07:11,603
Do you want to keep them or switch them?

238
00:07:11,603 --> 00:07:13,247
- There's no doubt in my mind I wanna keep them.

239
00:07:13,247 --> 00:07:15,925
- Alright, here we go. Three, two, one

240
00:07:15,925 --> 00:07:17,460
- Yeah! - No!

241
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,016
- [Collins] What the heck is that?

242
00:07:19,016 --> 00:07:19,870
Pickled Pork Skins!

243
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:23,010
Uh, you have got to be kidding me!

244
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,180
- Oh, it's sorbet,

245
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,013
I love sorbet.

246
00:07:26,521 --> 00:07:27,383
(scream)

247
00:07:27,383 --> 00:07:28,216
- Dude I got it all over me.

248
00:07:28,216 --> 00:07:31,140
No! - No, no, no, no, no!

249
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,140
Alright, here we go.

250
00:07:34,115 --> 00:07:34,948
Oh!

251
00:07:36,803 --> 00:07:38,830
- Oh dude, it's like pure rubber!

252
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:43,010
Holy cow. I'm like, mentally kind of freaking out right now.

253
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:44,086
Okay, here we go. Three

254
00:07:44,086 --> 00:07:46,620
I don't wanna do this anymore.

255
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,680
- I'll just count you down, ready?

256
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,810
Three, two, one

257
00:07:54,812 --> 00:07:56,381
- Alright dude, that's enough; that's enough.

258
00:07:56,381 --> 00:07:57,569
(screams)

259
00:07:57,569 --> 00:07:58,402
- I feel so bad for you.

260
00:07:58,402 --> 00:07:59,235
- It tastes like gasoline.

261
00:07:59,235 --> 00:08:00,068
- That is not healthy.

262
00:08:00,068 --> 00:08:01,930
- No! Like it tastes like

263
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:03,780
It feels like I'm in a car and it's about to go

264
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,613
You know what I mean?

265
00:08:04,613 --> 00:08:06,710
[Collins] The ice cream sundaes, guys, are coming together

266
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:08,920
and right now we are on to the next round.

267
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,940
- Alright Collins, do you want to keep it or switch it?

268
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,350
- See, this one is very important because

269
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:15,180
this is the second to last round so I'm going to use

270
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,886
my intellectual powers right now.

271
00:08:16,886 --> 00:08:19,680
(electric buzz)

272
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,480
- This one here, is the one with the ice cream under it.

273
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,380
- Okay. Three, two, one

274
00:08:24,411 --> 00:08:25,840
- Yeah! - No!

275
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,860
- What even is this, what?

276
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:29,516
- [Devin] Hot pickled jalapeno slices.

277
00:08:29,516 --> 00:08:31,350
Dude that's going to be so hot.

278
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,880
- My superpowers are on point.

279
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,920
P.B. and cookies.

280
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,971
Ah.

281
00:08:35,971 --> 00:08:37,103
This is like, multi-layered.

282
00:08:37,103 --> 00:08:41,340
- It's not just normal cookies, it's like Oreo cookies.

283
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:42,173
- Oh!

284
00:08:42,173 --> 00:08:43,190
Three, two, one

285
00:08:44,402 --> 00:08:45,740
- So jealous man.

286
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,368
Dude what are you doing, you're gonna break through the,

287
00:08:47,368 --> 00:08:48,850
dude, don't, what are you doing?

288
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,780
- That was amazing and I bet yours is going

289
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,670
to be even better, Devin.

290
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,450
- Oh yeah, I'm sure it will Collins.

291
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,464
- I can't wait to see your reaction to this.

292
00:08:54,464 --> 00:08:56,620
- Alright, here we go.

293
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,820
I don't think there is anything that could

294
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,653
prepare me for this.

295
00:08:58,653 --> 00:08:59,486
Alright, here we go.

296
00:08:59,486 --> 00:09:01,220
Three, two, one

297
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,716
Oh, it's so hot!

298
00:09:08,716 --> 00:09:09,549
- It was just the juice,

299
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,820
you didn't even get any jalapenos in your mouth!

300
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,780
- [Collins] It's almost the same face as

301
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,930
your brain freeze face.

302
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:14,890
- Uh huh.

303
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:15,939
It burns so bad.

304
00:09:15,939 --> 00:09:18,189
(grunting)

305
00:09:19,531 --> 00:09:21,520
(grunting)

306
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,840
- We're coming up to the finale and then

307
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,060
we're gonna be eating the biggest ice cream sundae

308
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,344
in the entire world and maybe even making a milkshake.

309
00:09:27,344 --> 00:09:28,928
- I don't think anything can help me.

310
00:09:28,928 --> 00:09:29,924
- Ice cream!

311
00:09:29,924 --> 00:09:30,933
(screams) - Yeah!

312
00:09:30,933 --> 00:09:32,410
- Bro, it's all empty.

313
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:35,853
If only Devin had ice cream to soothe the pain.

314
00:09:35,853 --> 00:09:37,250
This is an important one for you, Devin.

315
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,660
You can keep them or switch them.

316
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,050
And if you get ice cream, it will soothe the burning

317
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:43,120
in your mouth but if not, it will make it even worse.

318
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,481
So right now, do you want to keep it or switch it?

319
00:09:44,481 --> 00:09:46,072
- Bro, I am very aware of the situation.

320
00:09:46,072 --> 00:09:49,051
I'm gonna do your technique of this x-ray vision thing.

321
00:09:49,051 --> 00:09:49,989
- Okay great, go for it.

322
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:50,822
- Alright, here we go.

323
00:09:50,822 --> 00:09:51,958
(Electric buzz)

324
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,051
Okay, got it.

325
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:54,460
(Electric buzz)

326
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,915
I'm gonna switch it.

327
00:09:55,915 --> 00:09:56,748
Here we go. - Okay.

328
00:09:56,748 --> 00:09:58,360
Three, two, one

329
00:09:59,469 --> 00:10:00,302
- Yay!

330
00:10:01,495 --> 00:10:03,300
This is what I needed.

331
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,870
- Holy cow, that looks delicious.

332
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,792
Dev, watch out for the elbow.

333
00:10:06,792 --> 00:10:08,100
(moans)

334
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:08,990
It's like sweet relief.

335
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:09,960
What flavor is it?

336
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,217
- [Devin] Pumpkin cheesecake.

337
00:10:11,217 --> 00:10:12,870
Ah, I feel so much better now.

338
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,340
- I'm glad you do, because I don't

339
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,210
'cause I got cat food

340
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:17,030
Friskies, it's like, liver and chicken.

341
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:17,863
I don't wanna eat it.

342
00:10:17,863 --> 00:10:18,840
Ew!

343
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,204
No matter how many times I've ate cat food,

344
00:10:20,204 --> 00:10:21,230
doesn't get better.

345
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,178
Smell it. - I don't want to.

346
00:10:22,178 --> 00:10:23,300
- [Collins] I don't know what flavor, I don't know

347
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,300
what chicken is all blended together.

348
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,700
It looks like a flippin' sponge.

349
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,867
(screams)

350
00:10:29,158 --> 00:10:30,960
I eat with my face, it's like Ha!

351
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,910
There's like, little like, looks like bones in it.

352
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,906
- It's all the stuff I'm sure a cat doesn't care about

353
00:10:34,906 --> 00:10:35,880
- A cat is like,

354
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,194
"A bone? Give it to me!"

355
00:10:37,194 --> 00:10:39,933
(gulps)

356
00:10:39,933 --> 00:10:40,861
That's my impression of a cat.

357
00:10:40,861 --> 00:10:43,260
Time to eat some cat food.

358
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,871
I'll see you soon my feline friends.

359
00:10:44,871 --> 00:10:47,648
- I don't think any cats are watching this Collins.

360
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:49,290
(piano music)

361
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:51,651
Are you sad by that? I'm sorry.

362
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:52,974
- Yo, if you got a cat, bring a cat

363
00:10:52,974 --> 00:10:54,150
and the cat can watch this right now,

364
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:56,140
cause I'm about to eat some of your food, kitty.

365
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,620
- The kitty is like, "No!"

366
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,090
Three, two, one

367
00:11:01,184 --> 00:11:03,184
(moans)

368
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,893
Your face right now bro.

369
00:11:06,893 --> 00:11:09,060
(screams)

370
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,863
- The time has finally come to mix up our ice cream sundaes,

371
00:11:13,863 --> 00:11:15,230
so get it in there.

372
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:20,000
- [Collins] Ohmygosh, the wasabi! I forgot about the wasabi!

373
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,540
- [Devin] I forgot about the Spam!

374
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,290
- There's so much extra stuff in here.

375
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:24,311
At least I got some sprinkles in here, that's kinda nice.

376
00:11:24,311 --> 00:11:26,680
And this is definitely the weirdest ice cream sundae,

377
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,513
but you know what?

378
00:11:27,513 --> 00:11:29,610
I wanna be able to experience all of these flavors

379
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:31,940
at the same time, and just with a big spoonful.

380
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:32,773
- What?

381
00:11:32,773 --> 00:11:33,606
- And I won't be able to do that.

382
00:11:33,606 --> 00:11:34,550
- So we got one of these blenders here.

383
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,510
We're gonna blend it up into a milkshake,

384
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,370
and then drink them.

385
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:38,520
- Oh, I'm not hype.

386
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,810
- Yours looks way better than mine,

387
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:41,130
but mine has way more ice cream.

388
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:43,840
- But I also have something called Spam in mine,

389
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,670
and also jalapeno peppers.

390
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:47,503
- Oh!

391
00:11:48,516 --> 00:11:49,934
You added some to mine!

392
00:11:49,934 --> 00:11:50,767
No, no!

393
00:11:50,767 --> 00:11:52,658
- [Devin] Splash guards, splash guards.

394
00:11:52,658 --> 00:11:53,615
- All that Kimchi!

395
00:11:53,615 --> 00:11:55,290
- Oh that looks so gross!

396
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:56,490
- Oh my gosh.

397
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:57,860
- I'm already feeling queasy.

398
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,980
- [Devin] Mine does, on the surface,

399
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,200
look a lot better than yours though.

400
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,990
- Oh my gosh, you good?

401
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:04,268
- No, what, how could it be good?

402
00:12:04,268 --> 00:12:05,200
- [Collins] Dude, it's gonna splash!

403
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,410
- Ah, it's on my fingers!

404
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:10,170
- And the Spam, the Spam is coming!

405
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:12,370
- Oh snap!

406
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,670
- Okay, time to pop on the top.

407
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,930
- Pop the tops!

408
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:16,550
- Look, it's like dripping down the side.

409
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,150
Full blast, we're going max.

410
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:20,648
Ready? Three, two, one

411
00:12:20,648 --> 00:12:24,627
- [Collins] Oh, that went quick, holy cow!

412
00:12:24,627 --> 00:12:25,560
- Feel like it's good.

413
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,983
- Mine is up to the max, here we go.

414
00:12:26,983 --> 00:12:27,816
- Oh!

415
00:12:29,437 --> 00:12:31,551
- [Collins] All the pig skins, ohmygod.

416
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:32,384
Done.

417
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:35,730
- All the clear bits in there, and it's the pig skins.

418
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:36,563
- You know what Devin?

419
00:12:36,563 --> 00:12:37,396
There's actually one more

420
00:12:37,396 --> 00:12:39,070
wild card I want to throw in this right now.

421
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:39,903
- Wait, no, why?

422
00:12:39,903 --> 00:12:41,362
This is already a wild card.

423
00:12:41,362 --> 00:12:42,360
(clapping)

424
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,781
- [Collins] Anchovies!

425
00:12:43,781 --> 00:12:44,645
- [Devin] No!

426
00:12:44,645 --> 00:12:45,971
- [Collins] Here's how it works right now.

427
00:12:45,971 --> 00:12:46,894
Rock, paper, scissors.

428
00:12:46,894 --> 00:12:48,141
Whoever loses, has to put anchovies in.

429
00:12:48,141 --> 00:12:49,660
- Bro, it's going down.

430
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,500
- And we're going three rounds.

431
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,273
Each round the loser has to put this in, okay?

432
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,080
We might both get it, you ready?

433
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,661
- Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

434
00:12:56,661 --> 00:12:57,494
(buzzer)

435
00:12:57,494 --> 00:12:58,932
- Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

436
00:12:58,932 --> 00:12:59,765
(buzzer)

437
00:12:59,765 --> 00:13:00,598
- Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

438
00:13:00,598 --> 00:13:01,550
- Bam! - No!

439
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,056
- Devin got one anchovy, you gotta pop in right now.

440
00:13:03,056 --> 00:13:05,190
Oh, it got on my fingers!

441
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,279
Ew, it's like oil!

442
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:07,950
- It smells so bad!

443
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,112
- [Collins] Alright bro, pop it in! Pop it in!

444
00:13:09,112 --> 00:13:11,540
Alright, next round, here we go.

445
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,480
- Rock, paper, scissors, shoot! (buzzer)

446
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,694
- Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

447
00:13:14,694 --> 00:13:16,150
- Yes! - No!

448
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,511
I'm so not happy, how do I get this off?

449
00:13:17,511 --> 00:13:18,870
(screams)

450
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,530
- [Collins] Dude I do not want to do this.

451
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,430
This has turned into an oily, slippery mess!

452
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:23,866
- [Collins] Alright, here we go, Three, two, one

453
00:13:23,866 --> 00:13:25,749
Oh it's not coming out!

454
00:13:25,749 --> 00:13:28,450
Final round, here we go.

455
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:31,087
- Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

456
00:13:31,087 --> 00:13:32,004
- No! - Yes!

457
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:34,220
- [Collins] Ugh, the oil's everywhere.

458
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,181
- [Devin] It's dripping on me, dude.

459
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:37,006
(screams)

460
00:13:37,006 --> 00:13:37,855
- Why would you do that?

461
00:13:37,855 --> 00:13:38,688
- I'm sorry!

462
00:13:38,688 --> 00:13:39,521
So here it is,

463
00:13:39,521 --> 00:13:42,885
the biggest ice cream sundae milkshake of all time, cheers!

464
00:13:42,885 --> 00:13:43,718
- Cheers!

465
00:13:43,718 --> 00:13:45,280
- We love you guys, and by the way, comment down below.

466
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,815
What other flavors of ice cream we should use

467
00:13:46,815 --> 00:13:49,860
in another video, and right now Devin, cheers.

468
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,210
- Cheers.

469
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:52,660
- Here we go. Three, two, one

470
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:59,383
(gags)

471
00:13:59,383 --> 00:14:00,640
- It's so hot!

472
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:04,500
- Oh man, I almost lost it guys!

473
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,889
Look right here for a new video.

474
00:14:05,889 --> 00:14:07,383
Love you, bye!

475
00:14:07,383 --> 00:14:10,109
- I must have gotten straight jalapenos!

476
00:14:10,109 --> 00:14:12,276
(screams)

477
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,333
- Bye!

478
00:14:15,364 --> 00:14:16,290
- [Devin] Ohmygoodness.

479
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,457
- Oh my gosh!

480
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:18,550
I quit!
