00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,506
(electronic music)

2
00:00:03,506 --> 00:00:05,811
(tape rewind)

3
00:00:05,811 --> 00:00:06,644
- What's up?

4
00:00:06,644 --> 00:00:08,710
It's Collins Key and welcome to the Thursday vlog.

5
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:10,556
Now for today's video, I'm coming back at you guys,

6
00:00:10,556 --> 00:00:11,822
with a brand new challenge,

7
00:00:11,822 --> 00:00:13,552
but of course I can't do this alone,

8
00:00:13,552 --> 00:00:15,073
so I've got someone to help me out,

9
00:00:15,073 --> 00:00:17,162
my little brother Devan Key.

10
00:00:17,162 --> 00:00:18,765
- Eh, what's up?

11
00:00:18,765 --> 00:00:20,576
- He was under that table for a long time.

12
00:00:20,576 --> 00:00:22,004
- Yeah, my knees really hurt right now.

13
00:00:22,004 --> 00:00:22,991
- Yeah, for today's video,

14
00:00:22,991 --> 00:00:24,546
we are doing a brand new challenge

15
00:00:24,546 --> 00:00:27,248
and it's the whipped cream, pie in face challenge

16
00:00:27,248 --> 00:00:28,456
and so basically, how this challenge works,

17
00:00:28,456 --> 00:00:30,058
is it's like a Russian roulette game,

18
00:00:30,058 --> 00:00:31,335
used with whipped cream.

19
00:00:31,335 --> 00:00:32,775
We have this little spinner thingy right here,

20
00:00:32,775 --> 00:00:36,095
so you spin the spinner, whatever number it lands on,

21
00:00:36,095 --> 00:00:37,915
you put your head in this little thingy here

22
00:00:37,915 --> 00:00:39,735
and you kinda twist and you go one, two...

23
00:00:39,735 --> 00:00:40,568
Ah, geez!

24
00:00:40,568 --> 00:00:42,097
It will pop up, at some point, randomly.

25
00:00:42,097 --> 00:00:43,815
Hopefully, you don't get pied in the face.

26
00:00:43,815 --> 00:00:45,646
Now were going to be doing a whole bunch of rounds,

27
00:00:45,646 --> 00:00:47,713
starting off of course, with the classic whipped cream

28
00:00:47,713 --> 00:00:48,732
and then we're going to be moving up

29
00:00:48,732 --> 00:00:50,868
to even grosser and grosser things.

30
00:00:50,868 --> 00:00:53,503
And for the final one, he doesn't even know what it is,

31
00:00:53,503 --> 00:00:55,802
but it is going to be our least favorite thing,

32
00:00:55,802 --> 00:00:56,742
in the entire world.

33
00:00:56,742 --> 00:00:58,217
So make sure you guys watch this entire challenge,

34
00:00:58,217 --> 00:01:00,237
to find out what the last item is.

35
00:01:00,237 --> 00:01:02,443

But yeah, without any further ado, what do you say Devan, we

62
00:01:52,786 --> 00:01:53,619
- [Together] Let's jump

63
00:01:53,619 --> 00:01:54,452
- Right into the challenge.

64
00:01:54,452 --> 00:01:55,285
- Challenge.

65
00:01:55,285 --> 00:01:56,118
- We never get that.

66
00:01:56,118 --> 00:01:56,951
- Let's try it one more time.

67
00:01:56,951 --> 00:01:57,784
Three, two, one

68
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,962
- [Together] Let's jump right into the challenge.

69
00:01:59,962 --> 00:02:01,481
Oh!

70
00:02:01,481 --> 00:02:02,630
- Awkward and everything.

71
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,194
Alright, to determine who goes first,

72
00:02:04,194 --> 00:02:06,168
we're going to be using this spinner right over here.

73
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:07,991
We're each gonna give it a flick, give it a spin

74
00:02:07,991 --> 00:02:10,127
and whoever lands on a higher number,

75
00:02:10,127 --> 00:02:14,016
that person has to go first, so Devan, take it away.

76
00:02:14,016 --> 00:02:14,849
- [Devan] Yeah, that that was all good.

77
00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:15,682
That was a good spin.

78
00:02:15,682 --> 00:02:17,872
- [Collins] That was a good spin.

79
00:02:17,872 --> 00:02:18,705
- No!

80
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:20,816
- Oh, so you're probably gonna go first, for sure.

81
00:02:20,816 --> 00:02:21,829
- No.

82
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:22,662
- So I just have to get-

83
00:02:22,662 --> 00:02:23,612
- Please be a five, please be a five

84
00:02:23,612 --> 00:02:24,691
- [Collins] If I just get like a four or a three

85
00:02:24,691 --> 00:02:25,524
Yes!

86
00:02:25,524 --> 00:02:26,357
- No!

87
00:02:26,357 --> 00:02:28,506
- I got a two, alright, so Devan, you have to go first.

88
00:02:28,506 --> 00:02:31,152
(bell ringing)

89
00:02:31,152 --> 00:02:31,985
Let's see how many times,

90
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,170
you're gonna have to click it.

91
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,172
- [Devan] Please don't be five, please don't be five.

92
00:02:35,172 --> 00:02:36,005
- Four!

93
00:02:36,005 --> 00:02:38,447
Alright, so Devan, put your head on the special thingy.

94
00:02:38,447 --> 00:02:39,280
- Okay.

95
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,980
- Yep and we're gonna put some whipped cream on here

96
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,440
and this is the first one, so we really wanna -

97
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,310
- I'm terrified.

98
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,886
- You have to do it four times, so go for it Devan.

99
00:02:46,886 --> 00:02:48,680
- Okay wait, I have to make, okay wait.

100
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,513
Okay.

101
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:51,708
- [Together] Oh!

102
00:02:54,485 --> 00:02:55,318
- Ah!

103
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:57,160
Okay, okay.

104
00:02:58,287 --> 00:02:59,633
Oh, sorry.

105
00:02:59,633 --> 00:03:00,466
I didn't mean that.

106
00:03:00,466 --> 00:03:01,616
- I can't open my eyes.

107
00:03:01,616 --> 00:03:02,544
- Are you, like, okay?

108
00:03:02,544 --> 00:03:04,041
- Well, I'm not opening my eyes.

109
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:05,008
I can't open my eyes.

110
00:03:05,008 --> 00:03:07,435
- Well since Devan is incapacitated right now,

111
00:03:07,435 --> 00:03:08,874
we're gonna take a quick break

112
00:03:08,874 --> 00:03:09,780
to make sure that we can get him,

113
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:10,732
I don't know, some paper towels.

114
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:13,843
We'll come right back at you guys with some brand new stuff.

115
00:03:13,843 --> 00:03:15,827
(laughing)

116
00:03:15,827 --> 00:03:16,805
Done.

117
00:03:16,805 --> 00:03:17,730
Is this underneath the nose?

118
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:18,563
Oh.

119
00:03:18,563 --> 00:03:19,396
It's like shaving right here.

120
00:03:19,396 --> 00:03:20,963
- It's on my neck?

121
00:03:20,963 --> 00:03:22,171
Is that you're finger?

122
00:03:22,171 --> 00:03:23,320
(laughing)

123
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,503
- That was round one, so Devan takes an L,

124
00:03:25,503 --> 00:03:26,873
for the first round and

125
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,840
(laughing)

126
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,861
- [Together] Literally on the first one.

127
00:03:30,861 --> 00:03:32,846
(bell ringing)

128
00:03:32,846 --> 00:03:35,096
- So you got cat food here.

129
00:03:37,274 --> 00:03:41,319
I'm just gonna give this a spin, so let's see what we got.

130
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:42,152
- Alright.

131
00:03:42,152 --> 00:03:43,215
- I got five, no!

132
00:03:43,215 --> 00:03:44,548
- [Together] Oh.

133
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:46,835
- Put it all on.

134
00:03:46,835 --> 00:03:47,668
- Alright, go.

135
00:03:47,668 --> 00:03:49,525
- One, two, three, four, five

136
00:03:49,525 --> 00:03:50,358
Ah!

137
00:03:50,358 --> 00:03:51,382
- Oh! He got it on-

138
00:03:51,382 --> 00:03:52,219
- My eye!

139
00:03:52,219 --> 00:03:53,719
- Yes!

140
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:55,469
Tissue to the rescue.

141
00:03:57,034 --> 00:03:58,853
Poor Collins.

142
00:03:58,853 --> 00:04:00,350
- I feel like you're wiping more into my eye.

143
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:02,637
Alright, so Devan, you finally get your first point there.

144
00:04:02,637 --> 00:04:03,473
- Yeah!

145
00:04:03,473 --> 00:04:04,306
- Take that, spin it.

146
00:04:04,306 --> 00:04:05,478
- I take that W, bro.

147
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:06,311
- That win.

148
00:04:06,311 --> 00:04:07,460
- I take that W.

149
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,491
- Oh my God, that stuff is so gross.

150
00:04:09,491 --> 00:04:10,908
- What did I get?

151
00:04:12,472 --> 00:04:13,534
- [Together] A four.

152
00:04:13,534 --> 00:04:15,856
- So, I'm just gonna use what's on the table already

153
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:16,689
- Wait, what?

154
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:17,522
- And here we go.

155
00:04:17,522 --> 00:04:19,704
- Woah, I thought we doing one round of each thing.

156
00:04:19,704 --> 00:04:20,537
- No, no, no.

157
00:04:20,537 --> 00:04:21,430
Now it's your turn.

158
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,263
- Two of each.

159
00:04:22,263 --> 00:04:23,680
- One, two, three

160
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:25,374
- Go, okay

161
00:04:25,374 --> 00:04:26,207
- Yeah!

162
00:04:26,207 --> 00:04:28,230
- Let's see what I got.

163
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:29,123
Five, no.

164
00:04:29,123 --> 00:04:30,226
- Oh!

165
00:04:30,226 --> 00:04:32,966
- One, two, three, four, five

166
00:04:32,966 --> 00:04:34,812
This thing is broken.

167
00:04:34,812 --> 00:04:36,367
This thing didn't even come close to my face.

168
00:04:36,367 --> 00:04:37,796
Well, I think that we figured out

169
00:04:37,796 --> 00:04:39,609
that cat food is kind of a fail for this thing,

170
00:04:39,609 --> 00:04:40,674
- Cause I don't think it can leverage.

171
00:04:40,674 --> 00:04:42,253
It just looks so gross, dude.

172
00:04:42,253 --> 00:04:43,086
- Oh!

173
00:04:43,086 --> 00:04:44,247
- This whole thing's just nasty.

174
00:04:44,247 --> 00:04:45,988
- [Voiceover] 20 minutes later.

175
00:04:45,988 --> 00:04:47,126
- Alright, to be fully honest with you guys,

176
00:04:47,126 --> 00:04:49,309
this challenge is not going, at all, how we expected.

177
00:04:49,309 --> 00:04:50,458
We tried to get crazy with it

178
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:52,223
and throw in some, like, cat and dog food

179
00:04:52,223 --> 00:04:53,697
and just can't handle it.

180
00:04:53,697 --> 00:04:55,543
We wanted to make it really fun and funny for you guys,

181
00:04:55,543 --> 00:04:58,005
but this thing is just failing miserably

182
00:04:58,005 --> 00:04:59,351
and so, you know what?

183
00:04:59,351 --> 00:05:01,859
We still want to make this video amazing for you guys

184
00:05:01,859 --> 00:05:03,531
- Slammed it down.

185
00:05:03,531 --> 00:05:05,122
- Well I'm kinda frustrated with it,

186
00:05:05,122 --> 00:05:07,026
cause it's not working.

187
00:05:07,026 --> 00:05:08,883
We still wanna make this video amazing for you guys

188
00:05:08,883 --> 00:05:10,985
and so we are switching it up.

189
00:05:10,985 --> 00:05:12,189
We are making a brand new challenge.

190
00:05:12,189 --> 00:05:14,917
So, disregard everything we've done so far.

191
00:05:14,917 --> 00:05:16,845
Here is how the brand new challenge works.

192
00:05:16,845 --> 00:05:18,528
We are still going to be using this thing

193
00:05:18,528 --> 00:05:20,211
and the spinner over here,

194
00:05:20,211 --> 00:05:22,046
but since this thing cannot handle

195
00:05:22,046 --> 00:05:24,147
this awesomeness of this video,

196
00:05:24,147 --> 00:05:26,899
what we're gonna be doing is were using these pie shells.

197
00:05:26,899 --> 00:05:28,246
- We're basically gonna fill them up

198
00:05:28,246 --> 00:05:30,103
with the different things that we would be putting on here

199
00:05:30,103 --> 00:05:30,936
- Exactly.

200
00:05:30,936 --> 00:05:32,564
So round 1 is going to be whipped cream,

201
00:05:32,564 --> 00:05:33,397
so we're gonna fill this whole thing

202
00:05:33,397 --> 00:05:34,726
with whipped cream, spin a number.

203
00:05:34,726 --> 00:05:36,166
Still the same thing where we put our heads here,

204
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:38,024
but instead of this thing hitting us in the face,

205
00:05:38,024 --> 00:05:40,514
because it cannot accomplish that, unfortunately,

206
00:05:40,514 --> 00:05:42,685
we're gonna be smacking each other with a pie in the face.

207
00:05:42,685 --> 00:05:44,217
So, let's jump into this brand new pie,

208
00:05:44,217 --> 00:05:45,607
a real pie in the face challenge.

209
00:05:45,607 --> 00:05:46,896
Alright, so wound-

210
00:05:46,896 --> 00:05:47,729
- Wound 1.

211
00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:48,921
- Wound 1 is whip cweam.

212
00:05:48,921 --> 00:05:51,743
(bell ringing)

213
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,576
Alright, there it goes.

214
00:05:52,576 --> 00:05:54,398
Here's pie number uno.

215
00:05:54,398 --> 00:05:55,237
Gonna spin.

216
00:05:55,237 --> 00:05:57,884
And let's see what number I get.

217
00:05:57,884 --> 00:05:58,952
- A five!

218
00:05:58,952 --> 00:05:59,901
- No!

219
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:00,734
Here we go, let's see,

220
00:06:00,734 --> 00:06:02,545
one, two, three, no!

221
00:06:02,545 --> 00:06:04,063
- Yeah!

222
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:06,441
You get a pie to the face, you get a pie to the face.

223
00:06:06,441 --> 00:06:08,080
- Don't hurt me

224
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,913
- Ready?

225
00:06:08,913 --> 00:06:09,746
- Yep.

226
00:06:09,746 --> 00:06:10,579
- Three, two

227
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:11,412
Oh!

228
00:06:16,405 --> 00:06:19,157
- Hello, I literally can't hear anything out

229
00:06:19,157 --> 00:06:20,016
of this side of my head.

230
00:06:20,016 --> 00:06:22,266
(laughing)

231
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:24,567
- That went in my ear.

232
00:06:24,567 --> 00:06:26,251
(laughing)

233
00:06:26,251 --> 00:06:28,465
- Literally every time I do a video, it gets in your ear

234
00:06:28,465 --> 00:06:29,762
- No it's in my ear, dude.

235
00:06:29,762 --> 00:06:31,306
No, I don't like it.

236
00:06:31,306 --> 00:06:32,139
No!

237
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:32,972
- It's what you get bro.

238
00:06:32,972 --> 00:06:33,805
- What?

239
00:06:33,805 --> 00:06:34,685
Dude, it's in my ear.

240
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:35,892
- It's in my nose!

241
00:06:35,892 --> 00:06:37,491
Alright, here we go, round 2 is going

242
00:06:37,491 --> 00:06:40,487
to be whipped cream and dog food combined.

243
00:06:40,487 --> 00:06:41,495
- Hey, I get to fill it up.

244
00:06:41,495 --> 00:06:43,197
No, I like filling this stuff up.

245
00:06:43,197 --> 00:06:44,456
- Alright.

246
00:06:44,456 --> 00:06:46,816
(bell ringing)

247
00:06:46,816 --> 00:06:48,136
- I'm gonna get the dog food here.

248
00:06:48,136 --> 00:06:49,773
- No!

249
00:06:49,773 --> 00:06:51,492
- Okay, quick pick a number!

250
00:06:51,492 --> 00:06:52,325
It's in my eye.

251
00:06:52,325 --> 00:06:54,179
I can't see anything. Oh my God.

252
00:06:54,179 --> 00:06:55,012
- You need help?

253
00:06:55,012 --> 00:06:56,269
- It's literally in my eye.

254
00:06:56,269 --> 00:06:57,465
- Oh, I got four.

255
00:06:57,465 --> 00:06:58,526
That's okay, that's okay.

256
00:06:58,526 --> 00:07:01,025
Alright, one, two, three, four.

257
00:07:01,025 --> 00:07:01,858
- Oh!

258
00:07:01,858 --> 00:07:02,691
- Yeah!

259
00:07:02,691 --> 00:07:03,941
- No.

260
00:07:03,941 --> 00:07:04,945
- Spin it bro.

261
00:07:04,945 --> 00:07:06,385
- Everything is milky looking.

262
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:07,218
- [Devan] Four.

263
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,385
You have four.

264
00:07:09,418 --> 00:07:10,251
- Ah!

265
00:07:10,251 --> 00:07:11,084
- No!

266
00:07:11,084 --> 00:07:11,917
No.

267
00:07:11,917 --> 00:07:12,809
No,

268
00:07:12,809 --> 00:07:13,726
no, no, no.

269
00:07:14,631 --> 00:07:15,827
The whole world is milky right now.

270
00:07:15,827 --> 00:07:16,660
There's stuff in my eye.

271
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,775
- [Together] Four!

272
00:07:17,775 --> 00:07:18,608
- Go, go, go, go.

273
00:07:18,608 --> 00:07:19,681
- Okay, one, two

274
00:07:19,681 --> 00:07:21,330
- No!

275
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:22,163
- Okay, here we go.

276
00:07:22,163 --> 00:07:22,996
- No.

277
00:07:22,996 --> 00:07:23,829
- Here we go.

278
00:07:23,829 --> 00:07:24,662
- No.

279
00:07:24,662 --> 00:07:25,875
- Three, look at this, two

280
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:26,708
- I don't want this.

281
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:27,541
I don't want it.

282
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:28,374
- Stay still. Stay still.

283
00:07:28,374 --> 00:07:30,291
(yelp)

284
00:07:38,944 --> 00:07:40,673
I bet you, I look really nasty right now.

285
00:07:40,673 --> 00:07:42,299
- No, you look amazing Devan.

286
00:07:42,299 --> 00:07:43,692
Yeah guys, go on Devan's Instagram

287
00:07:43,692 --> 00:07:45,259
and tell him how good he looks right now.

288
00:07:45,259 --> 00:07:46,409
Alright, now it's time for round 3,

289
00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:47,430
the worst round of them all.

290
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,343
It's gonna be whipped cream, dog food,

291
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:52,423
combined with our least favorite thing sparkles.

292
00:07:52,423 --> 00:07:53,256
- No!

293
00:07:53,256 --> 00:07:54,089
- We-

294
00:07:54,089 --> 00:07:54,922
- No.

295
00:07:54,922 --> 00:07:55,755
- We hate sparkles.

296
00:07:55,755 --> 00:07:56,794
- It gets everywhere and-

297
00:07:56,794 --> 00:07:57,627
- Never comes off

298
00:07:57,627 --> 00:07:58,460
- Never leaves.

299
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,680
- And so we want to make this a really special sparkles pie

300
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,421
and so what we're doing here,

301
00:08:02,421 --> 00:08:04,186
is we've got two things of sparkles.

302
00:08:04,186 --> 00:08:08,269
First thing we're using at the bottom of the pie.

303
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,200
- Oh no.

304
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,141
Dude.

305
00:08:11,141 --> 00:08:12,290
- We've got sparkles. My eyes-

306
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,020
- This is never gonna, like my eyelashes,

307
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:17,050
my eyebrows, my hair, what is this?

308
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:17,941
- We're doing a lot for you guys.

309
00:08:17,941 --> 00:08:18,774
Here, hey

310
00:08:18,774 --> 00:08:19,607
- Wait does this go in the-

311
00:08:19,607 --> 00:08:22,152
- No, now we put in the whipped cream.

312
00:08:22,152 --> 00:08:24,532
- Why do you always get to do the whipped cream?

313
00:08:24,532 --> 00:08:25,426
- I don't know, it's my channel.

314
00:08:25,426 --> 00:08:26,460
(laughing)

315
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,097
(bell ringing)

316
00:08:28,097 --> 00:08:29,745
- Oh, this one smells worse.

317
00:08:29,745 --> 00:08:31,312
- That smells worse?

318
00:08:31,312 --> 00:08:32,950
- Oh, it smells so much worse.

319
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:33,783
- Dump it.

320
00:08:33,783 --> 00:08:34,633
(wet smack)

321
00:08:34,633 --> 00:08:35,945
- Oh, the sound.

322
00:08:35,945 --> 00:08:37,278
- [Together] Oh.

323
00:08:38,673 --> 00:08:39,679
It's kinda like nood-

324
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,051
like some weird...

325
00:08:41,051 --> 00:08:41,895
- I think it's got rice in the...

326
00:08:41,895 --> 00:08:43,340
Oh God, it's got rice

327
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,624
- It looks like worms.

328
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:46,154
- Oh, it looks like maggots.

329
00:08:46,154 --> 00:08:47,404
- And then last but not least, you get to finish off

330
00:08:47,404 --> 00:08:49,061
with some sparkles on the top.

331
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:49,952
- I don't want to.

332
00:08:49,952 --> 00:08:51,102
I don't like it.

333
00:08:51,102 --> 00:08:51,935
- Dude, that's way too-

334
00:08:51,935 --> 00:08:52,768
Oh, dude.

335
00:08:52,768 --> 00:08:53,601
- What?

336
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:54,434
- Dude, dude, that's so much.

337
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:55,267
- I'm going.

338
00:08:55,267 --> 00:08:56,100
You going?

339
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:56,933
Alright, let's see what you got.

340
00:08:56,933 --> 00:08:57,766
I better-

341
00:08:57,766 --> 00:08:58,599
four.

342
00:08:58,599 --> 00:08:59,748
Uh oh.

343
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:01,838
- Please no, please no.

344
00:09:01,838 --> 00:09:02,987
- [Together] Oh!

345
00:09:02,987 --> 00:09:05,026
(laughing)

346
00:09:05,026 --> 00:09:05,859
- No!

347
00:09:05,859 --> 00:09:06,692
- Yes!

348
00:09:06,692 --> 00:09:07,679
- Why did I go?

349
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:08,512
- Yeah!

350
00:09:09,787 --> 00:09:10,620
- No!

351
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,774
- Yes!

352
00:09:11,774 --> 00:09:14,479
- No, no, I got the worst two.

353
00:09:14,479 --> 00:09:16,604
You only got whipped cream.

354
00:09:16,604 --> 00:09:18,241
What is this challenge?

355
00:09:18,241 --> 00:09:20,385
- Three, I feel really bad right now

356
00:09:20,385 --> 00:09:21,396
- I have to take a breath

357
00:09:21,396 --> 00:09:22,707
Alright.

358
00:09:22,707 --> 00:09:24,124
- Three, two, one

359
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,310
(spitting)

360
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:40,041
Alright guys, well that is the challenge.

361
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,725
