1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:00,943
- Slime dump!

2
00:00:00,943 --> 00:00:01,920
Three, two--

3
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,300
- Oh no. - One!

4
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,280
We've got puppies and you challenged us to

5
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,950
let puppies pick our slime ingredients.

6
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:08,240
My guy's name is Hans.

7
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,933
- And mine is Frans.

8
00:00:09,933 --> 00:00:10,766
- So right now, you ready?

9
00:00:10,766 --> 00:00:11,924
All right, here we go.

10
00:00:11,924 --> 00:00:12,757
On the count of three, three, two, one, go for it, bro.

11
00:00:12,757 --> 00:00:14,430
- There you go. - Pick some slime ingredients.

12
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:16,210
- Let's do it, come on. Go this way.

13
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:17,240
- There ya go. - Go that way.

14
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,022
- See-- - There we go, yes!

15
00:00:19,022 --> 00:00:19,855
- He's on it. - They're off to the races.

16
00:00:19,855 --> 00:00:22,010
- [Collins] First ingredient, here we go, Sta-Flo, nice.

17
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:23,383
Great job, great job, let's see what we got, glue!

18
00:00:23,383 --> 00:00:26,020
Dude, this is awesome, perfect, markers,

19
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,380
okay, I don't know how I'm gonna use that.

20
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:29,940
Is that chalkboard paint?

21
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,110
- [Devan] First up, I got food coloring, yes.

22
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:35,230
Glue! Yes, I could totally use that.

23
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:37,130
Styrofoam balls, no! No styro--

24
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:38,300
Sta-Flo is great.

25
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,670
Alright, I'm gonna start off with my styrofoam balls.

26
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:41,580
- Did someone say bouncy balls?

27
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:42,413
- No! (spring sound effect)

28
00:00:42,413 --> 00:00:43,553
- Yeah! (bass party music)

29
00:00:43,553 --> 00:00:47,100
- No, no! I said styrofoam balls, not bouncy balls, bro.

30
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,230
- Wait, did you say bouncy balls?

31
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:49,948
- No! - I got you bro!

32
00:00:49,948 --> 00:00:50,781
(bass party music)

33
00:00:50,781 --> 00:00:52,210
- No! - Alright guys, let's make

34
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,267
some slime right now. - Bro, how did you get th--

35
00:00:54,267 --> 00:00:55,840
- Oh, oh, almost got it (deep laugh)

36
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,690
- So like I was saying, it's time to.

37
00:00:58,809 --> 00:00:59,660
- Oh, sorry, I did not mean to do that.

38
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,370
- It's time to crush up my styrofoam,

39
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:03,690
so I'm gonna use this little mallet here. (thumping)

40
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:04,670
- Bro, that's gonna take forever.

41
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:06,035
Here we go! - Oh, jeez!

42
00:01:06,035 --> 00:01:08,222
- Boom! There we go bro that is awesome.

43
00:01:08,222 --> 00:01:10,130
- What? - For my first ingredient

44
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:11,890
we're gonna use some of this paint right here.

45
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:14,761
We don't wanna get any chunks in the chalkboard paint

46
00:01:14,761 --> 00:01:15,594
'cause you don't want a chalky chunky chalkboard,

47
00:01:15,594 --> 00:01:16,540
know what I mean fam? (hooting)

48
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:19,350
- Look at mine, this looks insane.

49
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:22,260
It actually looks like popcorn, I'm so shocked.

50
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,010
- [Collins] And it's becoming creamy too.

51
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:25,540
- I'm making popcorn slime.

52
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,570
- First ingredient is in. - Wait, that's your first

53
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,120
ingredient? Dude, I'm almost done with mine.

54
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,220
- What? You know what?

55
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:32,240
I didn't want to have to do this, but it's the only way

56
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,390
I can slow you down, Tiny Devan.

57
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:36,107
- No! - Three, two, one, boom!

58
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,400
- Hah! You don't have your powers anymore! (gasps)

59
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,503
- Oh my gosh! - What did you do to me?

60
00:01:42,503 --> 00:01:44,797
- I'm so sorry. - Look at my hands!

61
00:01:44,797 --> 00:01:46,016
Oh, I'm feeling a little faint.

62
00:01:46,016 --> 00:01:47,617
- Whoa, whoa, Devan, Devan, Devan, Devan.

63
00:01:47,617 --> 00:01:52,380
- Collins, hold me, please, please, please, Collins, please.

64
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,850
I can't live like this! - Devan, stop!

65
00:01:56,847 --> 00:01:59,070
- How can I paint with these hands?

66
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,570
- Oh my gosh, you're so heavy.

67
00:02:01,425 --> 00:02:03,823
Dude, it's not that big a deal, I can fix this.

68
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:05,423
- Just gonna fix my hair, sorry.

69
00:02:06,602 --> 00:02:09,040
Dude, I can't even make slime, look at this.

70
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,073
How am I gonna make slime like this?

71
00:02:12,807 --> 00:02:16,657
I can't even clean off my hands, I can't even clean--

72
00:02:16,657 --> 00:02:19,940
Oh, Collins, I'll never be able to pet Frans again.

73
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,440
- I don't mean to laugh, I don't mean to be insensitive,

74
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,200
but this is the funniest thing we've ever done.

75
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,853
- I can't live like this. (slow piano music)

76
00:02:27,853 --> 00:02:31,764
Change me back, you have to, I beg of you.

77
00:02:31,764 --> 00:02:33,138
- Hold out your hands like this.

78
00:02:33,138 --> 00:02:34,260
It might be more helpful to close your eyes

79
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,070
so this doesn't shock you anymore.

80
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,774
- Okay, just do it. - I got you bro.

81
00:02:37,774 --> 00:02:40,820
Here we go, three, two, one, bam?

82
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,901
- Are they gone? - Technically yes.

83
00:02:42,901 --> 00:02:45,170
- What do you mean? (screaming)

84
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:46,830
What kind of joke is this?

85
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,300
- Okay Devan relax. - Bro, change me back!

86
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,450
- Third time's a charm, right?

87
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:52,866
Three, two, one. (magical chimes)

88
00:02:52,866 --> 00:02:54,003
Oh no! - What?

89
00:02:54,003 --> 00:02:56,790
I don't even have opposing thumbs now,

90
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,320
these are the hands of a sea creature!

91
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,570
- Okay, Devan, relax, calm down, I need you to

92
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:02,920
stay with me bro, one more time, this one's it.

93
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:06,150
Three, two, no more horsing around, I promise, one!

94
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,730
Bam! (magical chimes) - No!

95
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,486
What did you do to me this time?

96
00:03:09,486 --> 00:03:10,319
- I think I used the wrong choice of words.

97
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,730
- I don't even have hands, I have hooves.

98
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:14,080
- Okay. (Devan screams)

99
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,640
- I'll take the small hands, bro, just take me back.

100
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,080
I'll take anything but these.

101
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,370
- I forgot, I need the extendable hand to fix you back.

102
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,520
Stand right there. - This better work.

103
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,770
- Three, two, one, boom! - Ah!

104
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:28,550
Oh yes, oh my goodness, it feels good to feel again.

105
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,650
Bro, thank you, thank you, I mean wait, no,

106
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,590
you did this in the first place.

107
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,330
Get off of me bro, you're gonna have a

108
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:35,480
time out for that dude.

109
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,230
- Well now that that's over I can resume making

110
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,390
my glue and that really gave me no advantage whatsoever.

111
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,939
I'm so sorry bro.

112
00:03:40,939 --> 00:03:41,980
- Need a breather, bro, oh man.

113
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,150
- Alright, here we go gonna add my glue.

114
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:44,983
(silly whirring sound effect)

115
00:03:44,983 --> 00:03:46,018
Nailed it.

116
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:47,330
Now it's time for the Sta-Flo, so here we go.

117
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:48,440
Gonna open it up and we're gonna

118
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,450
make some chalkboard slime.

119
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:52,500
So my real question is, will I be able to actually

120
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,520
write things on my chalkboard slime?

121
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,420
Time to get serious about this mixing so I've got

122
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,910
the official mixers, and that's about all

123
00:03:58,910 --> 00:03:59,743
I'm gonna use 'em for.

124
00:03:59,743 --> 00:04:01,880
I forgot to mix the glue with the paint, though.

125
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,800
This might not be good.

126
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,280
It looks like a shredded garbage bag.

127
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,823
This thing is an udder fail. - Yes.

128
00:04:05,823 --> 00:04:08,230
- This is horrible. - You failed? I love it.

129
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:10,120
- So here's the true test, will it write?

130
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,670
Here we go, oh!

131
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:15,153
I can't believe it literally worked, that is so cool.

132
00:04:15,153 --> 00:04:16,983
- That is really awesome.

133
00:04:16,983 --> 00:04:18,581
- You have slime that has writing on it, woo!

134
00:04:18,581 --> 00:04:21,570
Oh, snap, now you can mush it back up

135
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:22,453
and you're back to regular slime.

136
00:04:22,453 --> 00:04:24,890
You get to comment down below, who made a cooler slime?

137
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:25,910
Oh snap!

138
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,390
Okay, it's time to get the next slimes.

139
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,480
You guys are doing a great job, buddy, yeah.

140
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,313
- Crushing it.

141
00:04:30,313 --> 00:04:32,137
- Look at his little arms, he's like, "Yeah, I love picking

142
00:04:32,137 --> 00:04:34,478
"slimes, I want that one, I want that one--"

143
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:36,670
- Hi five? Yeah. (laughing)

144
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:37,820
- Are you ready bro, Hans?

145
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,270
It's time to get it, here we go, three, two, one,

146
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,450
go for it buddy, go for it.

147
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,290
- Be free. - First up, Sta-Flo, dude,

148
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:44,870
great job Hans. No!

149
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,420
Glitter glue, I hate glitter.

150
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,850
Wait, are those plastic fish?

151
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,770
Okay, and then, are you thirsty?

152
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:51,420
No, that's my ingredient, okay, water.

153
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:54,770
- Go to the white glue, yes, next up, neon glitter.

154
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,720
I can work with that. Neon paint?

155
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,100
Alright, this is gonna be a fun slime,

156
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,010
and Sta-Flo, perfect.

157
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:02,140
(bell rings) - Devan? Devan!

158
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,010
- [Announcer] And now the continuing adventures

159
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:07,713
of Tiny Devan! ('80's keyboard music) (Devan screaming)

160
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,800
- Collins, I'm down here! - Here he is, hey!

161
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,630
- I was literally about to become Puppy Chow.

162
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:21,806
- Oh my gosh, bro I am so sorry, here go, three, two, one.

163
00:05:21,806 --> 00:05:23,670
(chimes) - Yes, I'm big again.

164
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,870
- Kicking it off right now with my glitter glue.

165
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:26,820
- Oh, almost dropped my glue.

166
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,800
- Here we go--

167
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,478
- Next up, I add florescent tempura paint.

168
00:05:31,478 --> 00:05:32,800
Alright now it's time for me to mix it around.

169
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,270
- I'm feeling extra confident, so I'm gonna

170
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,617
go for a long shot with my glue.

171
00:05:35,617 --> 00:05:37,670
- The what? - The long shot with the glue.

172
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,405
- How? - Just, and then just go p--

173
00:05:40,405 --> 00:05:43,270
and then it'll be perfect, three, two, one. (splat)

174
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,280
Oops. - You know what?

175
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,173
I'm not actually feeling this blue,

176
00:05:46,173 --> 00:05:47,170
so I'm actually gonna add this yellow instead.

177
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:48,923
Now it's time to mix it around.

178
00:05:49,778 --> 00:05:52,680
Whoa, dude, this looks insane!

179
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,290
Now it's time to add my next ingredient--

180
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:56,340
- Fish attack! - Whoa, wait, what?

181
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,010
- Awesome. Alright, glue is in.

182
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,880
Next up I've got water so I'm shouting to Hans,

183
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,880
I know what you're thinking, always stay hydrated. (slurps)

184
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,645
That's how dogs drink water, is that how dogs drink water?

185
00:06:05,645 --> 00:06:07,360
(slurping) Alright, word, bro.

186
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,300
- And yo, Frans, why did you pick glitter?

187
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,290
Dude, I hate glitter, c'mon, he's trying to

188
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:13,150
sabotage me or something, jeez man.

189
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,843
- Oo, snap, I filled up my bowl too much.

190
00:06:15,843 --> 00:06:17,720
I mean my ball, it's not a bowl.

191
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,390
A little bit of water, just gotta do a beach ball serve.

192
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:22,673
Three, two, one. (thud) That didn't work.

193
00:06:23,622 --> 00:06:24,455
- That was like a beach ball hand switch.

194
00:06:24,455 --> 00:06:26,943
- Now I'm gonna do it for real, here we go, three, two, one.

195
00:06:26,943 --> 00:06:28,550
(thud) Oh, oh no.

196
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,301
Here we go, I'll give it a little squeeze. (splash)

197
00:06:30,301 --> 00:06:31,680
- It doesn't squeeze. - It does!

198
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,600
- No it doesn't, you're getting water every--

199
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,280
- It's squeezing, it squeezes. - But it's not.

200
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,151
- I'm trying to show you, you said it doesn't-- (splash)

201
00:06:37,151 --> 00:06:40,050
Oh my gosh! - That's not a normal squeeze.

202
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:41,780
- We actually popped the little ball open.

203
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,220
- We? You're dragging me into this?

204
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,320
- Team effort Devan! - No, it was not.

205
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,410
- My shirt's soaked. - It's this guy.

206
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,690
- The water's in, next up, I gotta add my fishys,

207
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:51,460
so just pop 'em in there, oops, I missed a couple.

208
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,820
Thing is, I need a lot more fishes, so,

209
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,060
I am King Poseidon, king of the Seven Seas,

210
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,602
and I summon thee all right now. (waves splashing)

211
00:06:59,602 --> 00:07:02,000
- What is going on? - Ah, my kingdom and kinfolk.

212
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,240
There we have the leopard mantis seal,

213
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,160
the beluga whale fish. (both laughing)

214
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,910
You've seen them before in Discovery Channel.

215
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,190
- I have not actually.

216
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,703
- Ah, one of my kinfolk, Dolphindigulus.

217
00:07:12,703 --> 00:07:15,870
(high pitched sounds)

218
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,440
- Wait, bro is that even a real trident?

219
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,730
- How dare you question the authenticity of my staff!

220
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:24,482
Shar-keesha! Get him? - Shar-keesha! No!

221
00:07:24,482 --> 00:07:26,220
(muffled screaming)

222
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,600
- Shar-keesha! (garbled speech)

223
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,419
I'm gonna finish up the slime with the Sta-Flo-oh!

224
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:33,567
Just gonna pop some in right now.

225
00:07:33,567 --> 00:07:34,870
All the fishys are in there right now which should help,

226
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:35,730
'cause they're gonna be swimming around

227
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:36,870
and helping out as well. - Nice.

228
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,020
- Dude, mine is not working, looks like noodles.

229
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,300
- Oh, I'm gonna try to write something in the air

230
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,933
with my neon slime, bro, here we go.

231
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:49,910
There's one letter, two letters, three letters and four.

232
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,660
Oh, dude let's check mine out under a black light.

233
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,540
Here, take this flashlight, turn it on,

234
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,130
and we'll turn out the lights, you ready?

235
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:57,470
- Yep. - No, mine, dude,

236
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,960
what are you doing? - The fishes do glow though.

237
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,730
- What? - That's super cool.

238
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,580
- That's so awesome. Bro, I can't wait to see

239
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,090
if this works under the black light.

240
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:08,070
- Alright, I'll turn off the lights, three, two, one (claps)

241
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,210
Wait, first, five-second subscribe challenge.

242
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:12,100
We wanna see if you can subscribe to this channel

243
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,000
and turn on the channel post notifications

244
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,100
in five seconds, are you ready?

245
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,220
Here we go,

246
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:22,220
- [Both] five, four, three, two, one, done!

247
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:24,120
- If you can do that, comment down below,

248
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:29,110
Keyper Squad, right now. (sounds of amazement)

249
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:31,386
We need to get the lights back on now, so here we go.

250
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:33,360
(claps) Now it's time for you guys to vote,

251
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,614
who made a cooler slime? - I think it was me.

252
00:08:36,614 --> 00:08:38,170
(grunting) I got it, I got it.

253
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:39,740
His tooth is on it.

254
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,730
- Dogs did a great job last time, so for this round

255
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,670
we're gonna see if they can create even crazier slimes.

256
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:45,280
You guys ready, here we go, go for it.

257
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,392
Wait, you have him like a little baby.

258
00:08:47,392 --> 00:08:49,350
- It's so adorable, it just wants to snuggle in my arms.

259
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:51,110
Oh, he's ready, got some quick snuggle time

260
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,535
and now he's at it.

261
00:08:52,535 --> 00:08:55,400
- I've got contact solution, perfect, glow in the dark glue,

262
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,070
that is awesome, great job, and then beads.

263
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:01,920
- Alright Frans, Sta-Flo, good choice, cotton balls, what?

264
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,570
Alright, and then white glue, perfect.

265
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:07,580
- Let's make some slime. This is glow in the dark slime

266
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:11,530
whoa, whoa, whoa, don't ever bring a pillow

267
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:15,133
to a Tyrannosaurus Rex fight. (yelling)

268
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:19,635
- I won that thing. - No you didn't.

269
00:09:19,635 --> 00:09:20,590
Collins, I think you're cool.

270
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:22,150
- Back to what I was saying, this pink slime

271
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:24,010
is really cool 'cause it's glow in the dark.

272
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:25,610
This could be glow in the dark slime.

273
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:27,920
- Oh, that would be so awesome bro.

274
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,691
- Gonna add it in, it's got little sparkles in it,

275
00:09:30,691 --> 00:09:32,260
what's up with that? - Dude, what are you doing?

276
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,635
- Working on my forearms, bro I gotta get buff.

277
00:09:34,635 --> 00:09:37,730
It's my new workout plan, called Glue 90 Flex.

278
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:40,270
- Dude, your arms! - Whoa, I feel pumped up

279
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,857
right now bro, that stuff is crazy.

280
00:09:41,857 --> 00:09:44,714
You didn't believe me when I told you bro but

281
00:09:44,714 --> 00:09:46,430
these things get crazy. - Oh.

282
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:47,910
- These workouts are the best--

283
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:48,750
- Can you just let off? - Oh, sorry.

284
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,650
I'm sorry, I don't know my new strength.

285
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:55,200
Umbrellas! Nothing. (grunting)

286
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,410
- You're like one percent stronger.

287
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:58,360
- What? - It's all look, no function.

288
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,603
Dude, you good yet? (snap)

289
00:10:00,603 --> 00:10:01,610
- Oh! - Bro, these muscles

290
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:03,680
are changing you. - How do I get rid of 'em?

291
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,880
- Jut pull 'em off. - Oh, that was easy.

292
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,730
Woof, man, I feel a lot better, a lot more level-headed now,

293
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:11,770
so I'm just gonna take this more calmly now.

294
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:13,090
Gonna add some stars to this.

295
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:15,148
- Alright, got my cotton balls now it's time

296
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:17,243
to add these in here. (shaking)

297
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:21,160
- Perfect. - Was that really necessary?

298
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,930
You were almost better with the muscles.

299
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,540
Dude, with these cotton balls, I don't know

300
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,010
if my slime's gonna turn out, bro.

301
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:28,310
Dude, why are you doing such a risky maneuver?

302
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,820
- Time for my super-special new technique.

303
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,490
It's called the boots and boots.

304
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:33,892
- The cats, oh. - There's no cats.

305
00:10:33,892 --> 00:10:35,127
♪ Bloopah bloopah bloopah bloopah ♪

306
00:10:35,127 --> 00:10:35,960
♪ Bloopah bloopah bloopah bloo ♪

307
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,830
- Dude, it's like a kid playing in the rain.

308
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:39,670
- This is basically Collins playing in slime right now,

309
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,503
this is great.

310
00:10:40,503 --> 00:10:41,910
Boots are out, now it's time for the pecker staff.

311
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,350
So the pecker staff just goes in like this

312
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,195
and just pecks away the slime (sneezes) man!

313
00:10:45,195 --> 00:10:46,740
- Bless you. - Thank you.

314
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,470
Alright, I've been mixing my slime now

315
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:51,470
and it's not turning out so well at all.

316
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:54,300
- Dude, it looks like marshmallows, bro.

317
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,630
My slime is coming together nicely, but it's not getting

318
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,750
milky enough, you know what I mean?

319
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,530
I'm sorry Hans, you did pick some great items,

320
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:01,922
but unfortunately the, oh, pick it up!

321
00:11:01,922 --> 00:11:03,095
- It's not even a problem, bro.

322
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:03,928
- That was close.

323
00:11:03,928 --> 00:11:04,990
I was gonna add some Sta-Flo.

324
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:08,140
Ow, okay, note to self, might not be the best idea

325
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,860
to add in these super spiky stars because you're

326
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,760
squeezing it and all that, it's like (throat static) oh

327
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,620
and like (throat static), you know what I mean?

328
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,410
- No, I don't. - Alright, you know what?

329
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,420
I think my slime is almost done, how's yours looking?

330
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,210
- It's looking great. - Dude, this thing turned out

331
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:24,100
so cool, but the real question is, will it glow in the dark?

332
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,460
Hold onto this for a second, Devan,

333
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:29,780
I gotta use the Clapper, here we go, three, two, one (claps)

334
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,910
- [Both] Yo, this is so cool!

335
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,830
- [Collins] Bro, I've never juggled glow in the dark slime.

336
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:38,830
This is crazy, oh snap, I dropped it again, here we go.

337
00:11:41,429 --> 00:11:44,080
- [Both] Three, two, one! Ah!

338
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:48,140
- They're eating my hair. What's up, hi, hi.

339
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:51,430
How are you guys? I love you man, so cute, bro.

340
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:52,730
The best dog partner ever.

341
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,003
Look at this one here, think we're gonna pick

342
00:11:55,003 --> 00:11:56,460
some new ingredients, you guys ready?

343
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,610
- Ah, he wants a little belly rub, so cute.

344
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,100
- He's been doing a lot of hard work,

345
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,900
just wants a little belly rub to relax.

346
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,360
Bath bombs, okay, we've got cornstarch, alright mines

347
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,490
going for water, how can you make slime out of water?

348
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:10,273
- Gold leaf, interesting, okay, contact solution,

349
00:12:10,273 --> 00:12:12,140
I can definitely work with that, clear glue,

350
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,164
could not get a more perfect slime.

351
00:12:14,164 --> 00:12:15,640
- Alright, so I've got my bath bombs and so first up

352
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,180
we gotta add some water to the bowl--

353
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,849
- Hey, Collins, you're a winner, you want a trophy?

354
00:12:19,849 --> 00:12:20,682
- This is like some sort of joke.

355
00:12:20,682 --> 00:12:22,330
- No, you're a winner, dude, there's not trick to it.

356
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:24,193
Just take it, dude, you're a winner.

357
00:12:24,193 --> 00:12:25,174
(whooshing, thudding)

358
00:12:25,174 --> 00:12:26,680
Oh, wait, what? I didn't think there was

359
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,270
a trick to that but apparently there is, alright,

360
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:31,400
I'm gonna try to use this, three, two, one. (clunks)

361
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,461
- Hey, there you go! - Wow, I'm back.

362
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:34,960
- He's back, alright. - That thing was terrifying.

363
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,120
So now it's time to add some water--

364
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,210
- Hey! I've added my glue and now I'm gonna

365
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:42,360
add the contact solution.

366
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,210
- You do that, now it's time for me to drop in

367
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:46,290
some bath bombs, which one do I want to go with first?

368
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:49,247
I'm gonna go with the gold one first, three, two, one.

369
00:12:49,247 --> 00:12:50,080
(splash) Oo!

370
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,470
- Why would you drop it like that?

371
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,399
- Look at it go! - Dude.

372
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:54,740
- We're just going all of them at the same time, bam,

373
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,710
put this one in there, we'll go with this one here,

374
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,720
another one, alright, we're going with that one there.

375
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,607
We'll go for this one here, and then we'll go

376
00:13:01,607 --> 00:13:03,260
for this green one, and then we'll uh--

377
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:07,080
- Oh oh! - Maybe if I mix it up.

378
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,840
That's not helping. - Use the broom.

379
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:13,517
- We gotta use the big spoon, to scoop, oh!

380
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,809
- Dude, you made it worse.

381
00:13:17,809 --> 00:13:19,250
- I'll get a little broom off.

382
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,320
- Ow, my foot, you dropped it on my foot.

383
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,370
- I'm sorry, bro, but I'm panicking, bro.

384
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,560
- We should have done one at a time.

385
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,210
- Yeah, you're totally right. (laughing)

386
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:30,870
Well, you know what, first ingredient is in.

387
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,450
Maybe a little bit too much, you might say,

388
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,070
you'd be wrong, 'cause this is the perfect amount.

389
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:36,090
I'm a hold this under the water and see what happens.

390
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:38,850
- It smells so good right now.

391
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:41,670
- They're all still full, my hands are so slippery now

392
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:42,630
I can't even pick up anything.

393
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:45,350
But next up, gotta add some cornstarch into my slime.

394
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:47,630
Just, oh, so hard to grab it bro.

395
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:48,530
Here we go, three, two, one. (thud)

396
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:51,183
Oh, that worked, first time. - He acts shocked.

397
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:54,870
- Bath bombs mixed with cornstarch is not a good smell.

398
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,410
Hopefully this stuff makes some Oobleck

399
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:58,580
bath bomb Oobleck cornstarch would be kinda cool.

400
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,740
- Oh, what?

401
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,160
- I'm just gonna try to make this slime

402
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,020
as quickly as possible so we're gonna try to

403
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,370
squish up a whole bunch of bath bombs along with the

404
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:07,660
cornstarch and hopefully this turns into

405
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,770
some sort of slime, oh boy.

406
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:12,373
Oh, snap, there's a little toy in it.

407
00:14:13,543 --> 00:14:15,380
That or a random fish came to live in here.

408
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,730
I don't know what's going on with that, so we're gonna

409
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,440
let him live in this habitat, bloop, just pop him in there.

410
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,403
It feels so weird, I gotta say, it's not slimy yet.

411
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,480
I must say it is the most beautiful mess I've ever made.

412
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,620
For sure. - Very true.

413
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,260
- It's now time for the voice-changing microphone,

414
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,440
good evening, I'm Collins Key reporting live,

415
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,975
and Devan Key. - Hey, what's up.

416
00:14:37,975 --> 00:14:40,050
- Is going to be putting some gold leaf into his slime.

417
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:42,050
This is monumental, this has never been done before.

418
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:45,880
Slime, what do you have to say about this? (blurps)

419
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,430
Fascinating. - It came out clean!

420
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,653
It came out clean! - Word.

421
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:54,690
This is my show, Devan. - I have something to say.

422
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:56,610
You're not doing a very good job.

423
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,878
We'll take it, back to you Frans.

424
00:14:58,878 --> 00:15:00,957
(crickets chirping)

425
00:15:00,957 --> 00:15:02,710
And we're back, Frans didn't have much to say.

426
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,770
So he reaches for the gold leaf,

427
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:08,490
he places it on top, whoa, the puppies wait in suspense,

428
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:11,240
Devan goes for sheet number two and now, folks,

429
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,020
I don't know what to tell you, but it appears

430
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,410
that actually looks pretty awesome.

431
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:17,300
Wow, alright, the gold leaf slime looks pretty awesome.

432
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,162
Bath bomb slime, what do you have to say about that?

433
00:15:19,162 --> 00:15:20,690
(blurps)

434
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:21,890
Fascinating, alright, we're getting rid

435
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:24,400
of this microphone now, and you get to comment down below,

436
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,350
who made a cooler slime for this round?

437
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:28,950
Is it my awesome bath bomb slime or is it

438
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:30,850
Devan's whack gold leaf slime which is

439
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:32,320
actually pretty awesome.

440
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,190
Now it's time for the puppies to pick some new slimes.

441
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:36,040
- We're almost at the final round and Frans

442
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,300
has deserted me, what's going on buddy?

443
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,190
- He's already picking ingredients, bro.

444
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:40,120
Hans, want to join him?

445
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,290
Go get some more ingredients, Hans.

446
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:42,880
- We gotta pick this next slime.

447
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,150
- You got this, you got this.

448
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:47,310
I've got clear glue, fake snow and Sta-Flo,

449
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:49,490
fake snow, Sta-flo, it rhymes, great job, bro.

450
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,470
- Alright Frans, pick a good one, wait, toothpaste, what?

451
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:55,360
Shaving cream, okay, I can work with that, wait, dude,

452
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,900
not Sriracha, Frans, I thought we were friends.

453
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,533
There's no way I can make slime with this stuff.

454
00:16:01,821 --> 00:16:02,654
(sneezes) - Bless you.

455
00:16:02,654 --> 00:16:04,107
- Sorry, I tried to control it.

456
00:16:04,107 --> 00:16:05,370
- You scared Frans.

457
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,210
- Bro, we've got snow in a can!

458
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:09,840
- Wow! - You do not seem excited.

459
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:14,003
- I don't think it's real snow, it's just powder bro.

460
00:16:15,204 --> 00:16:16,380
- What? - Ah, dude, the smell.

461
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:20,370
Oh, I can't stand Sriracha, it's too spicy for me dude.

462
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:22,930
- Here we go, it's time to add the water.

463
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:24,880
You ready Devan? - Uh yes.

464
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,050
- Let's see if this turns into snow,

465
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:29,120
here we go, three, two, one. - Oh, what?

466
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,350
- What? - Yeah!

467
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:34,050
- This keeps getting bigger! - That's so sweet.

468
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:35,270
Wait, I wanna-- - No don't touch it.

469
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:37,610
This is mine. - Uh, jeez.

470
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:39,710
Dude, there's like no way, this is like goop.

471
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:42,100
- How does all of this fit into this?

472
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,730
Doesn't make sense, does not add up.

473
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:46,910
Oh, that smells so bad. - I know uh.

474
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:49,753
- I've got an idea, three, two, one, oh!

475
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:56,296
- That's so cool! So fluffy, oh my goodness.

476
00:16:56,296 --> 00:16:57,420
- I think it might be expanding too much.

477
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,130
- Yeah keep it in. - Keep it in, bro.

478
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:02,200
- There's so much snow. The snow is done.

479
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,110
- Feels so crazy, it's all squishy, no way.

480
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:08,370
- I think I added way too much, I forgot I was supposed

481
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:10,540
to make slime. (laughing)

482
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,640
- Just add some to mine, mine's already ruined.

483
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,747
- You want it? - Yeah, I'll just take it.

484
00:17:14,747 --> 00:17:17,120
- Just shoveling snow, you know, a huge mound of snow

485
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,190
everywhere so I gotta unload it a little bit.

486
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:21,230
We're back to the nice, fluffy, powdery snow.

487
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:23,180
- Dude, mine's yellow snow now.

488
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,830
- Uh oh, that's not good--

489
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:28,090
- It's warm and yellow. - Bad, very bad.

490
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:31,050
- Dude, just when I thought mine couldn't get any worse.

491
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,580
- Is it worse? - It looks so gross.

492
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,550
You will not live this one down Frans.

493
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,070
I'm done mixing mine, bro.

494
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:39,610
- Dude, it just keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger.

495
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:41,260
- You're getting it on my gloves.

496
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,160
- It's literally like a winter wonderland right now,

497
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,470
it's not even Christmas yet, bro.

498
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:48,662
How does all of this fit into this?

499
00:17:48,662 --> 00:17:50,977
It's already full, just that little bit.

500
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,668
Literally keeps growing-- - It just doesn't stop.

501
00:17:55,668 --> 00:17:57,141
- We should fill a pool with 10 thousand

502
00:17:57,141 --> 00:17:59,610
pounds of this stuff. Snow angel.

503
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:01,490
We're gonna add some glue next.

504
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:05,000
Whoa this is the weirdest feeling slime I've ever made.

505
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,540
Oh, what, this is so bizarre bro.

506
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:09,030
- Dude, what does it feel like?

507
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:12,430
- Oh, it feels like, gah, uh, ah!

508
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,050
- Somehow I know what that means.

509
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:16,200
- Oh, that's weird, that's not nice.

510
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,912
You get to comment down below, who made a cooler slime,

511
00:18:18,912 --> 00:18:19,930
but that one's pretty awesome.

512
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:22,580
Yo, we are outside, it is time for the slime dump.

513
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,780
You've been commenting down below,

514
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,603
who you think lost this challenge--

515
00:18:25,603 --> 00:18:26,860
- And I'm the winner!

516
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:30,387
- Wait, you are not the winner, that has not been decided.

517
00:18:30,387 --> 00:18:32,670
No, I am too, we're sharing the bucket, Devan, we both are--

518
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:34,550
- So what, we're both dumping it on each other?

519
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:36,220
- I have two hands on the bucket, okay?

520
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,770
- I actually have them on the bucket,

521
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:39,360
you have 'em on the handle, therefore, I'm the winner.

522
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,913
Whoa, whoa! (laughing)

523
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,930
- Here we go, on three, two--

524
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:46,770
- Wait, dude, there's no, wait.

525
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:49,630
A chair, (laughs) just for you Collins.

526
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:52,446
- It's like a throne almost. - A loser's throne.

527
00:18:52,446 --> 00:18:55,150
- What? I am not sitting in that throne.

528
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:57,140
You are gonna sit in that throne, oh that's heavy.

529
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,000
I don't like the name of this throne.

530
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,660
- You have no idea how heavy this is,

531
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,620
and it's so slippery too, you ready for this?

532
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,180
- Oh man, I'm not ready, gotta sit in my throne,

533
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,810
gotta get a little man up over here.

534
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:09,780
- Alright, here we go, slime dump, three, two, one.

535
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,870
- Oh, and if you wanna win a 15 minute video

536
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:15,790

537
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:19,410

538
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:21,270

00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,700

00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:26,960

541
00:19:29,285 --> 00:19:32,023
Oh, dude! - Oh my gosh!

Hey guys! (shrieks)

00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:37,689
(slow speed yelling)

544
00:19:37,689 --> 00:19:39,202
- Dude, it missed your face!

545
00:19:39,202 --> 00:19:40,260
(laughing)

546
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,270
