1
00:00:00,187 --> 00:00:01,020
- What's up guys?

2
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:01,853
It's Collins.

3
00:00:01,853 --> 00:00:03,237
Now, Halloween is right around the corner

4
00:00:03,237 --> 00:00:04,618
and if you guys are like me

5
00:00:04,618 --> 00:00:07,272
you probably procrastinate on your costumes.

6
00:00:07,272 --> 00:00:09,180
Today you're in luck because I'm gonna be

7
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,336
doing some last minute Halloween costumes.

8
00:00:11,336 --> 00:00:13,048
To help me out, I have a friend of mine

9
00:00:13,048 --> 00:00:15,125
the beautiful Meg De Angeles.

10
00:00:15,125 --> 00:00:15,958
Hey!

11
00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:16,791
Hey!

12
00:00:16,791 --> 00:00:17,624
- Welcome.

13
00:00:17,624 --> 00:00:18,954
- Thanks, hi.

14
00:00:18,954 --> 00:00:20,280
- And I decided to turn this into a challenge.

15
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,773
- Woo!

16
00:00:21,773 --> 00:00:23,640
- Here I have a giant pile of clothes,

17
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,534
random costume stuff,

18
00:00:25,534 --> 00:00:26,608
we've even given some categories

19
00:00:26,608 --> 00:00:27,862
like pirates, medieval.

20
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:29,109
And then in 30 seconds,

21
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:30,511
using the random pile of clothes

22
00:00:30,511 --> 00:00:32,085
we get to try and make that costume,

23
00:00:32,085 --> 00:00:33,082
super last minute.

24
00:00:33,082 --> 00:00:34,273
Let's get started.

25
00:00:34,273 --> 00:00:35,301
(snaps fingers)

26
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:38,579
That was (laughs), that was awkward.

27
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:39,695
Back in black,

28
00:00:39,695 --> 00:00:41,184
that's a Maddie right there,

29
00:00:41,184 --> 00:00:42,544
that's a last minute Halloween costume.

30
00:00:42,544 --> 00:00:43,708
- I think it's like a better base

31
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:45,468
for all the cool costumes we're gonna be putting on.

32
00:00:45,468 --> 00:00:46,499
- She knows a lot about this.

33
00:00:46,499 --> 00:00:48,196
I'm gonna go with her opinion on it.

34
00:00:48,196 --> 00:00:49,906
The first category is.

35
00:00:49,906 --> 00:00:50,811
- Fairies.

36
00:00:50,811 --> 00:00:51,676
- Go!

37
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:53,659
(fast forward talking)

38
00:00:53,659 --> 00:00:55,229
I think I have a wand stuck to my butt.

39
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:58,769
(fast forward talking)

40
00:00:58,769 --> 00:00:59,635
All right, that's time.

41
00:00:59,635 --> 00:01:00,468
- Dang it.

42
00:01:00,468 --> 00:01:01,301
- If you can tell I have the magical fairy wand.

43
00:01:01,301 --> 00:01:02,968
I went with the tutu

44
00:01:03,927 --> 00:01:06,771
because I wanted to be an ultra-masculine fairy.

45
00:01:06,771 --> 00:01:08,134
I'm good, I'm done here.

46
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:09,246
- He spends his life dressing up as a girl fairy pretty much

47
00:01:09,246 --> 00:01:10,079
but...

48
00:01:11,662 --> 00:01:13,102
Come back from the corner.

49
00:01:13,102 --> 00:01:14,050
- (Laughs)

50
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:14,883
- Oh a man crying in the corner.

51
00:01:14,883 --> 00:01:18,670
- My fairy friends, Petunia and Patricia.

52
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:19,619
This is my fairy outfit.

53
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:21,350
- So I am a fairly of the underworld.

54
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:25,517
And then this is the gem to get into my fairy caves,

55
00:01:26,637 --> 00:01:27,711
scan it to get in.

56
00:01:27,711 --> 00:01:28,544
- Wow.

57
00:01:28,544 --> 00:01:30,042
- There's only six of them in the whole world.

58
00:01:30,042 --> 00:01:30,875
- Wow.

59
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:31,984
- Yes, and then-

60
00:01:31,984 --> 00:01:32,817
- That's a lot of backstory for the one gem.

61
00:01:32,817 --> 00:01:33,797
- This is my wand,

62
00:01:33,797 --> 00:01:34,908
I'm like deep and dark

63
00:01:34,908 --> 00:01:35,858
and I'm also a bit hipster

64
00:01:35,858 --> 00:01:38,254
so instead of wands, I go with flowers,

65
00:01:38,254 --> 00:01:40,228
and then I have these sparkling wings on me,

66
00:01:40,228 --> 00:01:41,680
they're just for funzees, they don't even work.

67
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,286
- I think it's pretty apparent who won this one.

68
00:01:43,286 --> 00:01:45,187
I'm like Kanye West with this quilt on right now.

69
00:01:45,187 --> 00:01:47,112
All right guys, so,

70
00:01:47,112 --> 00:01:49,768
and now I'm a dirty fairy. (laughs)

71
00:01:49,768 --> 00:01:50,877
Let us know in the comment

72
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:52,362
who do you guys think won

73
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,758
this last-minute Halloween costume.

74
00:01:53,758 --> 00:01:55,278
- I mean, it was me but you know.

75
00:01:55,278 --> 00:01:57,132
- We are going to be doing hippies.

76
00:01:57,132 --> 00:01:58,074
One, two, three, go.

77
00:01:58,074 --> 00:01:59,976
(fast forward talking)

78
00:01:59,976 --> 00:02:00,877
I need more suspenders.

79
00:02:00,877 --> 00:02:01,830
(fast forward talking)

80
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,643
- Dude, you're gonna end up looking like a clown.

81
00:02:03,643 --> 00:02:06,210
(fast forward talking)

82
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,043
- Four, three,

83
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:07,876
- What am I doing here?

84
00:02:07,876 --> 00:02:08,948
- There's nothing! Two!

85
00:02:08,948 --> 00:02:09,953
Oh here! That's just one, okay.

86
00:02:09,953 --> 00:02:11,634
- Dang it, I made a bib.

87
00:02:11,634 --> 00:02:12,627
That was not meant to happen.

88
00:02:12,627 --> 00:02:13,460
- (Laughs)

89
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,857
Like this video if you guys think

90
00:02:14,857 --> 00:02:15,843
that Meg looks beautiful right now

91
00:02:15,843 --> 00:02:17,158
because those glasses are on point.

92
00:02:17,158 --> 00:02:19,424
- So I have this, it looks like a bow

93
00:02:19,424 --> 00:02:20,948
but really it's a hippie band.

94
00:02:20,948 --> 00:02:22,552
The bow represents happiness.

95
00:02:22,552 --> 00:02:24,320
This, you may think it's a bib,

96
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,385
but really it is a very fashionable top.

97
00:02:27,385 --> 00:02:28,218
- Mm.

98
00:02:28,218 --> 00:02:29,732
- And then we have this which is like,

99
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:31,939
it's more like a cape.

100
00:02:31,939 --> 00:02:32,949
- Oh.

101
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:34,030
- It's kind of like a cape style.

102
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,031
How about yours?

103
00:02:35,031 --> 00:02:36,931
- The hair, of course, is the most important part

104
00:02:36,931 --> 00:02:38,254
because that's what everyone sees.

105
00:02:38,254 --> 00:02:39,946
I have a little bit of a hair extension over here.

106
00:02:39,946 --> 00:02:41,311
I have these suspenders on,

107
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:43,088
I don't really know how to put suspenders on,

108
00:02:43,088 --> 00:02:44,912
it's also some nice resistance training

109
00:02:44,912 --> 00:02:46,361
when you're at concerts,

110
00:02:46,361 --> 00:02:49,712
you can get just work your triceps.

111
00:02:49,712 --> 00:02:52,143
I'm a hippie guy so I'm very in touch

112
00:02:52,143 --> 00:02:53,174
with my feminine side

113
00:02:53,174 --> 00:02:55,256
and so I like to wear skirts and dresses

114
00:02:55,256 --> 00:02:58,267
to signify the feminism in all of us.

115
00:02:58,267 --> 00:02:59,423
- You like wearing skirts,

116
00:02:59,423 --> 00:03:01,235
this is the second outfit with a skirt.

117
00:03:01,235 --> 00:03:02,764
- The first one was a tutu. (Laughs)

118
00:03:02,764 --> 00:03:03,977
In the comment down below,

119
00:03:03,977 --> 00:03:05,665
and let us know who won the hippie outfit.

120
00:03:05,665 --> 00:03:07,646
I think you might've taken this one home.

121
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:09,041
- Oh my god, what is this?

122
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:10,653
It's like Elmo threw up on my hair.

123
00:03:10,653 --> 00:03:11,778
- On the next category,

124
00:03:11,778 --> 00:03:13,426
we'll see if he chooses another skirt outfit,

125
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:14,708
but it's gonna be,

126
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:15,940
okay, you're in for it?

127
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:16,976
Vampire.

128
00:03:16,976 --> 00:03:17,970
- Cool.

129
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:19,086
(fast forward speaking)

130
00:03:19,086 --> 00:03:20,113
Oh my god! Vampire teeth.

131
00:03:20,113 --> 00:03:21,206
Clear advantage.

132
00:03:21,206 --> 00:03:22,452
- Oh you got that.

133
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,366
Did you say Claire Danes?

134
00:03:24,366 --> 00:03:25,558
- I said clear... (laughs)

135
00:03:25,558 --> 00:03:26,555
- (Laughs) I was like, "What?"

136
00:03:26,555 --> 00:03:27,543
- I said, "Clear advantage."

137
00:03:27,543 --> 00:03:28,537
(fast forward talking)

138
00:03:28,537 --> 00:03:29,684
- These are, these are, these are,

139
00:03:29,684 --> 00:03:30,517
these are a cross,

140
00:03:30,517 --> 00:03:31,350
I know what these are,

141
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,670
these are the flood gates.

142
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,725
- You're gonna have trouble speaking throughout this one

143
00:03:35,725 --> 00:03:37,913
but that's okay, I'll translate.

144
00:03:37,913 --> 00:03:38,944
- Cool.

145
00:03:38,944 --> 00:03:40,142
So guys.

146
00:03:40,142 --> 00:03:41,316
- He says my outfit sucks.

147
00:03:41,316 --> 00:03:43,566
- (Laughs)

148
00:03:47,553 --> 00:03:48,546
- (Laughs) No, he didn't do it.

149
00:03:48,546 --> 00:03:49,537
- Screw that.

150
00:03:49,537 --> 00:03:52,000
But it is an authentic vampires hat.

151
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,743
I wanna keep it modern and I put on this vest

152
00:03:53,743 --> 00:03:55,190
because it looks like something

153
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,639
that a vampire would wear now to kind of fit in.

154
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:59,172
These roses actually signify

155
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:02,109
that I am fourth level warlock vampire

156
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:04,624
of the seventh degree.

157
00:04:04,624 --> 00:04:06,324
If I just show this rose to people

158
00:04:06,324 --> 00:04:07,359
and they bow down, so.

159
00:04:07,359 --> 00:04:08,192
- Well, I-

160
00:04:09,714 --> 00:04:10,708
- And she's not in my clan.

161
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:11,990
- I'm (smiles)

162
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:12,876
- She's like, "I'm not gonna bow down."

163
00:04:12,876 --> 00:04:13,878
- Oh (laughs).

164
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:14,878
- Thank you.

165
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:17,854
- This is an eight level warlock clan, you see.

166
00:04:17,854 --> 00:04:19,345
Not to be too mainstream here

167
00:04:19,345 --> 00:04:21,250
but vampires will always have the cape.

168
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,061
If I'm too tired to suck my own blood,

169
00:04:23,061 --> 00:04:25,968
okay, I have my friend Petunia to suck the blood for me.

170
00:04:25,968 --> 00:04:29,524
- I hate losing so bad that every single...

171
00:04:29,524 --> 00:04:30,638
- Collins?

172
00:04:30,638 --> 00:04:32,257
- You have to understand that I literally yet

173
00:04:32,257 --> 00:04:33,829
to win any challenge ever on my channel?

174
00:04:33,829 --> 00:04:35,400
- Oh you tweeted that!

175
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,209
- Let me know on the comment down below

176
00:04:37,209 --> 00:04:38,615
who won this category.

177
00:04:38,615 --> 00:04:39,928
- Or Petunia will come for you.

178
00:04:39,928 --> 00:04:41,456
Hitting this club for thumbs up.

179
00:04:41,456 --> 00:04:43,188
Hit the thumbs up if you don't want Petunia to get you.

180
00:04:43,188 --> 00:04:44,343
- (Hisses)

181
00:04:44,343 --> 00:04:46,696
Like fashion guru tip here,

182
00:04:46,696 --> 00:04:49,377
if you start with maybe like a black t-shirt and leggings,

183
00:04:49,377 --> 00:04:51,940
a lot of costume possibilities are suddenly available.

184
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,425
- Yes. This is an original idea that I had.

185
00:04:54,425 --> 00:04:55,987
