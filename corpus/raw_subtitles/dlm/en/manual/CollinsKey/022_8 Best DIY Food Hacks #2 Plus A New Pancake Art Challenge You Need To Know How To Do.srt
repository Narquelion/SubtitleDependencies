1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,741
- You challenged us to make a giant watermelon faucet.

2
00:00:03,741 --> 00:00:05,070
So right now, let's go.

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:06,847
- [Devan] You want it flat enough to stand up.

4
00:00:06,847 --> 00:00:08,850
Next step is to cut a three inch hole in the top.

5
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,133
- When doing this, be very careful

6
00:00:10,133 --> 00:00:11,851
and maybe even ask for someone else's help.

7
00:00:11,851 --> 00:00:13,099
Time to remove my piece.

8
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:14,396
I cut open the top of it.

9
00:00:14,396 --> 00:00:16,496
- Whoa! - Oh my gosh!

10
00:00:16,496 --> 00:00:17,329
- Dude!

11
00:00:17,329 --> 00:00:19,417
- Oh snap, that was a fire-melon.

12
00:00:19,417 --> 00:00:20,811
Oh so that's what the spark--

13
00:00:20,811 --> 00:00:22,646
- Oh no! - Oh, oh!

14
00:00:22,646 --> 00:00:24,354
Control the melon!

15
00:00:24,354 --> 00:00:25,812
Dude, dude, control it, control it!

16
00:00:25,812 --> 00:00:27,646
- Whoa there we go, that's all good.

17
00:00:27,646 --> 00:00:29,396
- Ahh! - Ah, ah, dude!

18
00:00:30,588 --> 00:00:32,088
(explosion)

19
00:00:32,088 --> 00:00:32,921
- Is it over?

20
00:00:32,921 --> 00:00:33,754
- I don't know, I hope so.

21
00:00:33,754 --> 00:00:34,712
- What was that?

22
00:00:34,712 --> 00:00:35,912
- Alright, so right now I'm gonna need a watermelon,

23
00:00:35,912 --> 00:00:37,182
so I'll use my melon monkey.

24
00:00:37,182 --> 00:00:38,101
Here we go, we're goin' shopping.

25
00:00:38,101 --> 00:00:38,934
(electronic sound)

26
00:00:38,934 --> 00:00:39,767
And tap it.

27
00:00:39,767 --> 00:00:41,140
Perfect, alright let's see it.

28
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:41,973
- What?

29
00:00:41,973 --> 00:00:42,806
- And there's my watermelon, perfect.

30
00:00:42,806 --> 00:00:43,848
- You act like that's super normal.

31
00:00:43,848 --> 00:00:45,258
- Yeah that's how everyone gets their melons, right?

32
00:00:45,258 --> 00:00:46,091
Their melon monkeys.

33
00:00:46,091 --> 00:00:46,924
Oh!

34
00:00:46,924 --> 00:00:47,757
Nailed it.

35
00:00:47,757 --> 00:00:48,590
Boom, there we go.

36
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:49,704
And now for the three inch diameter at the top,

37
00:00:49,704 --> 00:00:50,604
I've learned from my mistakes

38
00:00:50,604 --> 00:00:52,970
and it is now shovel time.

39
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:53,819
- [Both Together] Oh!

40
00:00:53,819 --> 00:00:56,145
- I accidentally made it into a very unhappy dude.

41
00:00:56,145 --> 00:00:58,606
So here we go, we're just gonna cut off the whole top of it.

42
00:00:58,606 --> 00:00:59,759
Ugh, what'd you think?

43
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:00,592
W-w-wait.

44
00:01:00,592 --> 00:01:01,425
- [Devan] I got it.

45
00:01:01,425 --> 00:01:02,258
- [Collins] How did that happen?

46
00:01:02,258 --> 00:01:03,091
- I've been working on this for a while, Collins.

47
00:01:03,091 --> 00:01:03,924
- Alright forget it.

48
00:01:03,924 --> 00:01:04,801
You might'a had a whole bunch 'a juices,

49
00:01:04,801 --> 00:01:07,652
but did you have a full on cylinder?

50
00:01:07,652 --> 00:01:08,485
- Ha!

51
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:09,318
- Hold on, let me try this again.

52
00:01:09,318 --> 00:01:10,151
A full on cylinder!

53
00:01:10,151 --> 00:01:10,984
(plops)

54
00:01:10,984 --> 00:01:11,817
- [Both Together] Oh!

55
00:01:11,817 --> 00:01:12,701
- You know what, it's time to bring out

56
00:01:12,701 --> 00:01:13,534
the big boys.

57
00:01:13,534 --> 00:01:14,992
Ah!

58
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:16,935
- [Devan] Whoa!

59
00:01:16,935 --> 00:01:17,912
Dude, I need that!

60
00:01:17,912 --> 00:01:19,427
- You can't have it, it's all mine.

61
00:01:19,427 --> 00:01:20,825
- And now you're gonna have to wait for me Collins.

62
00:01:20,825 --> 00:01:23,320
- Yeah, I'm used to that with the pancake art challenges.

63
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,272
- Yeah.

64
00:01:24,272 --> 00:01:25,480
- We're almost done, now we's gotta blend us some

65
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,313
watermelon juice.

66
00:01:26,313 --> 00:01:27,328
Three, ready?

67
00:01:27,328 --> 00:01:28,326
- [Both Together] Two, one!

68
00:01:28,326 --> 00:01:30,398
- Wait, wait, dude, is yours working?

69
00:01:30,398 --> 00:01:31,336
- I think I have a solution Devan.

70
00:01:31,336 --> 00:01:33,968
We need to super charge it!

71
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:34,801
- Whoa!

72
00:01:34,801 --> 00:01:35,634
- A'right, here we go!

73
00:01:35,634 --> 00:01:36,791
- To the blender. - Here we go, here we go.

74
00:01:36,791 --> 00:01:37,982
- Ah! - Whoa!

75
00:01:37,982 --> 00:01:40,222
- Okay, I'm gonna try to get the charge ready.

76
00:01:40,222 --> 00:01:42,064
- Okay! - Here we go, are you ready?

77
00:01:42,064 --> 00:01:43,296
- Combine them. - Yep!

78
00:01:43,296 --> 00:01:44,632
- And then we're gonna set them down.

79
00:01:44,632 --> 00:01:46,058
Three, two, one!

80
00:01:46,058 --> 00:01:46,891
- W-w-wait!

81
00:01:46,891 --> 00:01:47,724
It needs a cape.

82
00:01:47,724 --> 00:01:48,557
- That's it?

83
00:01:48,557 --> 00:01:49,390
- Yes!

84
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:50,223
- Ah, man.

85
00:01:50,223 --> 00:01:51,208
You could'a just told me that from the beginning.

86
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:52,302
- Okay, just gonna put that on there.

87
00:01:52,302 --> 00:01:53,453
- That'll turn him into a superhero.

88
00:01:53,453 --> 00:01:54,758
And now it's a super charged.

89
00:01:54,758 --> 00:01:55,734
Man, that was just...

90
00:01:55,734 --> 00:01:57,817
- There you go.

91
00:01:57,817 --> 00:01:58,650
- Alright, now that mine is super charged,

92
00:01:58,650 --> 00:01:59,734
time to super charge yours.

93
00:01:59,734 --> 00:02:01,238
- W-w-whoa, mine just needs to be plugged in.

94
00:02:01,238 --> 00:02:02,071
- A'right, here we go.

95
00:02:02,071 --> 00:02:02,904
Three.

96
00:02:02,904 --> 00:02:03,737
- [Both Together] Two, one!

97
00:02:03,737 --> 00:02:04,574
(blender sounds)

98
00:02:04,574 --> 00:02:05,660
- [Both Together] Yeah!

99
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,629
- This blends really nicely.

100
00:02:06,629 --> 00:02:07,462
- Whoa!

101
00:02:07,462 --> 00:02:08,295
Ah!

102
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:10,065
(both screams)

103
00:02:10,065 --> 00:02:10,898
- Whoa, whoa, why would you take it off?

104
00:02:10,898 --> 00:02:12,414
That's like the worst.

105
00:02:12,414 --> 00:02:13,814
Dude, dude stop!

106
00:02:13,814 --> 00:02:14,996
- I made an absolute mess.

107
00:02:14,996 --> 00:02:17,295
Final step, we got the faucet and time to attach it.

108
00:02:17,295 --> 00:02:18,415
Whoa, straight in.

109
00:02:18,415 --> 00:02:19,256
Bam!

110
00:02:19,256 --> 00:02:20,343
It's already starting to work.

111
00:02:20,343 --> 00:02:21,298
(Devan sneezes)

112
00:02:21,298 --> 00:02:22,152
God bless you.

113
00:02:22,152 --> 00:02:23,656
- Alright, I'm screwing mine in now.

114
00:02:23,656 --> 00:02:24,817
And, done!

115
00:02:24,817 --> 00:02:25,698
And make sure it's closed

116
00:02:25,698 --> 00:02:27,034
before you pour this stuff in there.

117
00:02:27,034 --> 00:02:28,544
- [Collins] Arg, so close!

118
00:02:28,544 --> 00:02:29,377
Bam!

119
00:02:29,377 --> 00:02:30,210
There we go!

120
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,043
Gonna remove my super cape.

121
00:02:31,043 --> 00:02:31,876
Fleet!

122
00:02:31,876 --> 00:02:32,709
Let's pour it in, are you ready?

123
00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:33,542
- Yep.

124
00:02:33,542 --> 00:02:34,375
- [Both Together] Three, two, one.

125
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:35,633
Oh!

126
00:02:35,633 --> 00:02:37,413
- W-w-wait, I didn't close it.

127
00:02:37,413 --> 00:02:38,246
- What?

128
00:02:38,246 --> 00:02:39,079
- Which way does it go? Does it go that way?

129
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:39,912
- Yeah. - Boom, hoo!

130
00:02:39,912 --> 00:02:41,036
And now the moment of truth.

131
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:43,874
Will this actually dispense the watermelon juice, Devan?

132
00:02:43,874 --> 00:02:44,707
- Dispense?

133
00:02:44,707 --> 00:02:45,540
- Man, mine's fallin' out, we gotta--

134
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,373
Oh!

135
00:02:46,373 --> 00:02:47,381
- [Devan] W-w-what? - Ah!

136
00:02:47,381 --> 00:02:48,589
- [Both Together] Three, two, one!

137
00:02:48,589 --> 00:02:50,208
- But wait first, five second subscribe challenge.

138
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:52,135

143
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:03,599

144
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,476

145
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:05,567
- [Both Together] Oh!

146
00:03:05,567 --> 00:03:06,400
- Dude!

147
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,551
It looks so tasty.

148
00:03:07,551 --> 00:03:08,384
- Ah!

149
00:03:08,384 --> 00:03:09,217
Oh no!

150
00:03:09,217 --> 00:03:10,473
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! - Oh no, oh no, oh no!

151
00:03:10,473 --> 00:03:12,034
- What, what, what! - Stop it, stop it, stop it!

152
00:03:12,034 --> 00:03:12,867
Nothing.

153
00:03:12,867 --> 00:03:14,529
- [Devan] It isn't stopping, it isn't stopping!

154
00:03:14,529 --> 00:03:16,036
- You guys get to commend down below.

155
00:03:16,036 --> 00:03:16,869
Who won this one right now?

156
00:03:16,869 --> 00:03:18,135
We are on to the next one.

157
00:03:18,135 --> 00:03:18,968
- Woo!

158
00:03:18,968 --> 00:03:20,637
- You challenged us to do the pancake art challenge,

159
00:03:20,637 --> 00:03:22,424
but we are not allowed to use griddles, so--

160
00:03:22,424 --> 00:03:23,272
- What?

161
00:03:23,272 --> 00:03:24,636
- We're making coffee makers.

162
00:03:24,636 --> 00:03:25,469
- For real?

163
00:03:25,469 --> 00:03:26,302
- So if you've got a coffee maker,

164
00:03:26,302 --> 00:03:27,573
you can do a pancake art challenge right now.

165
00:03:27,573 --> 00:03:28,406
Let's go.

166
00:03:28,406 --> 00:03:29,239
- 'S gonna be so difficult.

167
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:30,139
- [Collins] A'ight let's take it off.

168
00:03:30,139 --> 00:03:31,167
I'm gonna be doin' the Grinch.

169
00:03:31,167 --> 00:03:32,525
- [Devan] And I'm gonna be doing Buzz Lightyear.

170
00:03:32,525 --> 00:03:34,325
It's already difficult as it is,

171
00:03:34,325 --> 00:03:35,541
with a six inch platter?

172
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:36,676
This is gonna be so tough.

173
00:03:36,676 --> 00:03:38,963
Wow, these are way more powerful than regular griddles bro.

174
00:03:38,963 --> 00:03:39,892
- [Collins] This is the most difficult

175
00:03:39,892 --> 00:03:41,204
pancake art challenge I've ever tried.

176
00:03:41,204 --> 00:03:42,037
- Oh my.

177
00:03:42,037 --> 00:03:43,166
- Just gonna pop the thing in here.

178
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:44,669
We're gonna to little droplets from the top.

179
00:03:44,669 --> 00:03:45,563
Little eyeball.

180
00:03:45,563 --> 00:03:47,424
His lil' like, iconic smile.

181
00:03:47,424 --> 00:03:48,917
- [Devan] Alright, adding some green now.

182
00:03:48,917 --> 00:03:49,882
- [Collins] Ahh, done, okay.

183
00:03:49,882 --> 00:03:51,142
I'm gonna give the Grinch some red eyes.

184
00:03:51,142 --> 00:03:52,477
'Cause you know the Grinch, he's angry.

185
00:03:52,477 --> 00:03:53,621
He's like, "I wanna steal Christmas".

186
00:03:53,621 --> 00:03:55,511
- W-w-whoa! - I want to steal Christmas!

187
00:03:55,511 --> 00:03:57,784
- I'm not Christmas, I am Devan.

188
00:03:57,784 --> 00:03:59,050
- [Collins] Eyebrow number one, great.

189
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,512
Eyebrow number two, even better.

190
00:04:00,512 --> 00:04:02,664
You know I'm gonna add the final touch, which is green.

191
00:04:02,664 --> 00:04:04,135
I'm gonna utilize the coffee maker.

192
00:04:04,135 --> 00:04:04,992
Green goes in.

193
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:05,864
- Alright, I'm done!

194
00:04:05,864 --> 00:04:06,744
- W-w-w-wait. - I am all done.

195
00:04:06,744 --> 00:04:07,577
- You're done?

196
00:04:07,577 --> 00:04:08,410
Lock in place.

197
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,243
Close top.

198
00:04:09,243 --> 00:04:10,076
Press button.

199
00:04:10,076 --> 00:04:11,073
Dispense!

200
00:04:11,073 --> 00:04:12,110
Wait, how does this work?

201
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,097
C'mon, it's gotta release the batter.

202
00:04:13,097 --> 00:04:14,427
- Dude, that's not gonna help.

203
00:04:14,427 --> 00:04:15,866
- What, you've never been to Starbucks before?

204
00:04:15,866 --> 00:04:16,875
This is how they do it, man.

205
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:18,147
Oh I got it, I figured it out bro.

206
00:04:18,147 --> 00:04:18,980
It's gotta get the top off.

207
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,841
And then see, I can use it to press here, and dispense it.

208
00:04:20,841 --> 00:04:22,675
See, and look it, I don't even need the top,

209
00:04:22,675 --> 00:04:23,529
I can just press right here.

210
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:24,649
It's a little bit weird, to be honest.

211
00:04:24,649 --> 00:04:27,569
This is a very slow process.

212
00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:28,402
Alright, well you know what,

213
00:04:28,402 --> 00:04:30,326
to finish it off, we'll give a little pour from coffee here.

214
00:04:30,326 --> 00:04:32,287
See what's so difficult here is trying to get this in.

215
00:04:32,287 --> 00:04:33,629
- Weird coffee maker, man.

216
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:35,197
- Alright, time to flip over my pancake.

217
00:04:35,197 --> 00:04:36,119
So here we go.

218
00:04:36,119 --> 00:04:36,952
Gonna go in.

219
00:04:36,952 --> 00:04:38,618
- [Devan] Oh no, it's not even fully cooked bro.

220
00:04:38,618 --> 00:04:40,378
- I think I have the wrong flipper.

221
00:04:40,378 --> 00:04:42,100
- [Both Together] Three, two, one!

222
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,209
- [Collins] Oh.

223
00:04:43,209 --> 00:04:45,025
- [Devan] Three, two, one, oh!

224
00:04:45,025 --> 00:04:45,992
- Not bad though.

225
00:04:45,992 --> 00:04:47,209
- If it wasn't scorched.

226
00:04:47,209 --> 00:04:48,379
Here we go, the flip, you ready?

227
00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:49,959
- [Both Together] Three, two, one!

228
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:51,212
- [Devan] Tight!

229
00:04:51,212 --> 00:04:53,249
Dude, it actually turned out pretty good.

230
00:04:53,249 --> 00:04:54,082
- No!

231
00:04:54,082 --> 00:04:55,248
- For such a small plate, yeah!

232
00:04:55,248 --> 00:04:56,081
- Dude are you kidding me?

233
00:04:56,081 --> 00:04:57,017
Wha'd'you mean, "Yeah"?

234
00:04:57,017 --> 00:04:58,992
That's amazing, bro, oh my gosh!

235
00:04:58,992 --> 00:05:00,332
You guys can comment down below.

236
00:05:00,332 --> 00:05:01,695
Who won this pancake art challenge?

237
00:05:01,695 --> 00:05:03,959
You challenged us to make a delicious frozen delight.

238
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:05,839
We got the dry ice, we got our gloves on,

239
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,648
and do not try this at home!

240
00:05:07,648 --> 00:05:08,507
So first step here,

241
00:05:08,507 --> 00:05:09,340
we're gonna place it down.

242
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,194
- Whoa, what is on the pan!

243
00:05:11,194 --> 00:05:12,314
- Whoa, it's like a little baby earthquake.

244
00:05:12,314 --> 00:05:13,147
I'll put it over here,

245
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:13,980
gonna add a little bit of water.

246
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,171
- No, n-n-n-no, you don't add water!

247
00:05:15,171 --> 00:05:16,004
- Why not?

248
00:05:16,004 --> 00:05:18,541
- If you want the perfect platform, you have to add it here

249
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:19,401
with no water.

250
00:05:19,401 --> 00:05:20,432
- Oh, alright, stop, stop, stop, stop, just get off.

251
00:05:20,432 --> 00:05:21,488
- What, what, what?

252
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:22,321
- My job.

253
00:05:22,321 --> 00:05:23,169
Alright, so you're gonna place this on top

254
00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:25,730
'cause we have to cool down this marble plate right here.

255
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,617
Next up we'll be adding some coconut milk to it,

256
00:05:27,617 --> 00:05:29,427
but first we have to prepare our fruit.

257
00:05:29,427 --> 00:05:31,049
As you can we have a whole bunch of sporks.

258
00:05:31,049 --> 00:05:31,882
Fleet!

259
00:05:31,882 --> 00:05:32,715
- Wait, where are my sporks?

260
00:05:32,715 --> 00:05:34,239
- Sporks aren't a real utensil.

261
00:05:34,239 --> 00:05:35,205
A'right, so now we got our berries

262
00:05:35,205 --> 00:05:36,181
and it's time to crush these things up.

263
00:05:36,181 --> 00:05:37,165
So let's see, oh.

264
00:05:37,165 --> 00:05:39,582
- [Devan] Oh man, this is really difficult, even for me.

265
00:05:39,582 --> 00:05:40,436
- Oh!

266
00:05:40,436 --> 00:05:41,269
Yes.

267
00:05:41,269 --> 00:05:43,044
(chopping sound)

268
00:05:43,044 --> 00:05:43,877
I feel like I'm breaking this.

269
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:44,830
- [Devan] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

270
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:45,770
Double spatula!

271
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:46,974
- [Collins] Are these spatulas?

272
00:05:46,974 --> 00:05:48,989
I feel like I'm beating out whatever this is.

273
00:05:48,989 --> 00:05:50,542
(chopping sounds)

274
00:05:50,542 --> 00:05:51,732
- Mine are way finer than yours.

275
00:05:51,732 --> 00:05:52,565
- Done!

276
00:05:52,565 --> 00:05:53,436
Now's the most exciting moment.

277
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,058
It is time to take our frozen slab,

278
00:05:55,058 --> 00:05:56,811
add the coconut milk, and we are going

279
00:05:56,811 --> 00:05:59,011
to turn this into a frozen delicacy.

280
00:05:59,011 --> 00:05:59,844
Three.

281
00:05:59,844 --> 00:06:00,822
- [Both Together] Two, one.

282
00:06:00,822 --> 00:06:02,412
- [Collins] Berry, are you playin' with me?

283
00:06:02,412 --> 00:06:03,280
- [Devan] A'right, I got it, I got it, got it, got it.

284
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,150
- And then we have to add this on top?

285
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:05,983
- [Both Together] Whoa!

286
00:06:05,983 --> 00:06:06,816
- [Devan] It's already frozen!

287
00:06:06,816 --> 00:06:07,649
- Frozen on the bottom of this,

288
00:06:07,649 --> 00:06:08,482
I gotta get it off!

289
00:06:08,482 --> 00:06:09,625
Dude, I gotta go much quicker,

290
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:10,554
I don't have enough coconut milk.

291
00:06:10,554 --> 00:06:11,570
I gotta get more!

292
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:12,403
- Whoa, whoa, what have I done!

293
00:06:12,403 --> 00:06:13,236
Man that looks like strawberry yogurt.

294
00:06:13,236 --> 00:06:14,261
I love strawberry yogurt.

295
00:06:14,261 --> 00:06:15,347
- I know how to get this even colder.

296
00:06:15,347 --> 00:06:16,723
Dry ice directly on it!

297
00:06:16,723 --> 00:06:17,685
- Wait, what?

298
00:06:17,685 --> 00:06:19,263
- [Collins] A'right here goes, just gonna put it on top.

299
00:06:19,263 --> 00:06:20,800
- I'm gonna try mixing it on my ice.

300
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,034
- Oh man. - Oh!

301
00:06:22,034 --> 00:06:23,336
- [Collins] It works instantly.

302
00:06:23,336 --> 00:06:24,195
- [Devan] It totally works.

303
00:06:24,195 --> 00:06:25,362
Now it's time to spread it out.

304
00:06:25,362 --> 00:06:27,232
- Oh, your mix looks like little rolls, right?

305
00:06:27,232 --> 00:06:28,090
- Yes!

306
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:29,889
A'right, now I have to put it back on the dry ice

307
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:30,899
for ten more seconds.

308
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:31,752
- Five. - Ahh!

309
00:06:31,752 --> 00:06:32,856
- Four. - Oh!

310
00:06:32,856 --> 00:06:33,998
- Three. - No!

311
00:06:33,998 --> 00:06:34,852
- Two, one.

312
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:35,685
Done!

313
00:06:35,685 --> 00:06:36,518
A'right, here we go.

314
00:06:36,518 --> 00:06:37,351
- Three, two, - Dude go for it!

315
00:06:37,351 --> 00:06:38,313
- One.

316
00:06:38,313 --> 00:06:39,241
Bro, it's working.

317
00:06:39,241 --> 00:06:40,074
- What!

318
00:06:40,074 --> 00:06:41,732
- It's rolling, it's like a little snowman.

319
00:06:41,732 --> 00:06:42,999
- You got it!

320
00:06:42,999 --> 00:06:45,236
- I gotta try to get mine. - Wha'd'you mean?

321
00:06:45,236 --> 00:06:46,130
- Got big ol' slab.

322
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:47,992
Yours is like, goals, mine is like, no!

323
00:06:47,992 --> 00:06:49,811
Comment down below, what is your favorite fruit

324
00:06:49,811 --> 00:06:51,704
you would love to see us mix into this next time.

325
00:06:51,704 --> 00:06:52,686
And we're onto the next one.

326
00:06:52,686 --> 00:06:54,294
You challenged us to make a pirate ship

327
00:06:54,294 --> 00:06:56,799
and right now, choose your fruit.

328
00:06:56,799 --> 00:06:58,047
- Watermelon, I choose you!

329
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,876
Whoa, dude it worked.

330
00:06:59,876 --> 00:07:02,111
- Bro, we're not doing Pokemon, we're doing Street Fighter.

331
00:07:02,111 --> 00:07:03,767
- What, well what was I supposed to do?

332
00:07:03,767 --> 00:07:04,632
- Supposed to do this.

333
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:05,613
(electronic sound)

334
00:07:05,613 --> 00:07:06,446
Watermelon!

335
00:07:06,446 --> 00:07:07,279
Boom.

336
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:08,342
- There we go. - Whoa, it actually worked!

337
00:07:08,342 --> 00:07:09,175
- A'right, well right now

338
00:07:09,175 --> 00:07:10,669
let's make some pirate ships outta watermelon.

339
00:07:10,669 --> 00:07:12,692
First up, we gotta make the bottom of the pirate ship.

340
00:07:12,692 --> 00:07:14,350
If you do this at home, be very careful.

341
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,285
Or even maybe ask for someone else's help.

342
00:07:16,285 --> 00:07:17,173
While you take your sweet time,

343
00:07:17,173 --> 00:07:19,077
it's a pirate's life fer me.

344
00:07:19,077 --> 00:07:20,577
Ready, set, carve!

345
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,880
(slice sound)

346
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,713
A'righty.

347
00:07:23,713 --> 00:07:24,847
- What, it didn't even work?

348
00:07:24,847 --> 00:07:25,830
- [Collins] Check it!

349
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,136
- No way! - Yep!

350
00:07:27,136 --> 00:07:29,231
- Dude, it actually worked, there's a little cut in there.

351
00:07:29,231 --> 00:07:30,311
- Three, ter, har, haha.

352
00:07:30,311 --> 00:07:32,097
- Did it actually work?

353
00:07:32,097 --> 00:07:33,053
- Tar

354
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:34,181
dar!

355
00:07:34,181 --> 00:07:35,819
It's all the mighty power of the cracken.

356
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:36,652
I mean the claw.

357
00:07:36,652 --> 00:07:37,485
- What?

358
00:07:37,485 --> 00:07:38,318
- Nothing.

359
00:07:38,318 --> 00:07:39,151
- You just cracked it in half.

360
00:07:39,151 --> 00:07:40,566
- Nothing, yeah, it worked good.

361
00:07:40,566 --> 00:07:41,965
- Alright, let's see how straight my line is.

362
00:07:41,965 --> 00:07:42,924
Ugh!

363
00:07:42,924 --> 00:07:44,195
- So now, time to gut 'em.

364
00:07:44,195 --> 00:07:45,849
So I'm gonna try this new technique.

365
00:07:45,849 --> 00:07:47,536
Ah man, wow.

366
00:07:47,536 --> 00:07:48,888
I accid- haha, I broke it.

367
00:07:48,888 --> 00:07:49,977
You what I've always wanted to put

368
00:07:49,977 --> 00:07:51,225
this watermelon scooper thingy to the test,

369
00:07:51,225 --> 00:07:52,058
so here we go.

370
00:07:52,058 --> 00:07:52,891
So I'm just gonna place him just like this,

371
00:07:52,891 --> 00:07:53,776
and then just--

372
00:07:53,776 --> 00:07:54,609
- [Devan] Whoa!

373
00:07:54,609 --> 00:07:55,587
- Oh my gosh, I think it worked.

374
00:07:55,587 --> 00:07:57,081
I just gotta like squeeze it to get it out now.

375
00:07:57,081 --> 00:07:57,914
Here we go.

376
00:07:57,914 --> 00:07:58,747
Squeeze, oh!

377
00:07:58,747 --> 00:07:59,580
Look it!

378
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,413
A'right here we go just gotta get a little grip on it.

379
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:01,246
Ah.

380
00:08:01,246 --> 00:08:03,211
Look at this beautiful slice of watermelon.

381
00:08:03,211 --> 00:08:04,044
Time to tenderize it!

382
00:08:04,044 --> 00:08:05,202
- Wait dude, where did you get the apron?

383
00:08:05,202 --> 00:08:06,694
And why does it say Grill Master?

384
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:07,769
- 'Cause I'm the grill master, bro.

385
00:08:07,769 --> 00:08:09,081
A'right, we gotta tenderize them a lil bit.

386
00:08:09,081 --> 00:08:09,914
Oh yeah.

387
00:08:09,914 --> 00:08:10,747
Oh!

388
00:08:10,747 --> 00:08:11,580
Tastes great.

389
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,163
A'right here we go, just gonna continue to tenderize.

390
00:08:13,163 --> 00:08:13,996
Woof!

391
00:08:13,996 --> 00:08:14,829
A'right you know what guys?

392
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:15,898
When you're a grill master, sometimes you just gotta

393
00:08:15,898 --> 00:08:17,210
go in with your hands, okay here we go.

394
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:19,376
Just gonna, nice, just scoop that out.

395
00:08:19,376 --> 00:08:21,836
Oh boy, man, this is pretty gunky over here.

396
00:08:21,836 --> 00:08:24,460
- It does not look like you're respecting your watermelon.

397
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,723
- Excuse me, I have so much respect for my watermelon,

398
00:08:26,723 --> 00:08:29,091
I'll even prove you wrong by becoming my own watermelon.

399
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:31,476
Watermelon tendofolis!

400
00:08:31,476 --> 00:08:33,490
- Whoa, Collins was that the best idea?

401
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:34,907
- Not watermelon tendofolis!

402
00:08:34,907 --> 00:08:37,548
Arg, pwow I should have thought that through.

403
00:08:37,548 --> 00:08:40,212
- Dude, yours is looking more like mush than balls.

404
00:08:40,212 --> 00:08:42,726
- Excuse me bro, do not insult my art.

405
00:08:42,726 --> 00:08:43,559
- Oh!

406
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,304
- Here we go, just gonna have to mold this together.

407
00:08:45,304 --> 00:08:46,384
It's almost there, here we go.

408
00:08:46,384 --> 00:08:47,730
- What is almost there? - Three, two,

409
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:48,563
My ball!

410
00:08:48,563 --> 00:08:50,088
One, ta-da..

411
00:08:50,088 --> 00:08:51,389
See there's still a little bit of fruit left in.

412
00:08:51,389 --> 00:08:52,446
And I can't have that for the bottom

413
00:08:52,446 --> 00:08:53,328
of my pirate ship.

414
00:08:53,328 --> 00:08:54,656
So I figured out a new method.

415
00:08:54,656 --> 00:08:59,489
(sucking sounds and clownish music plays)

416
00:09:02,412 --> 00:09:04,096
- Dude what are you doing?

417
00:09:04,096 --> 00:09:06,929
What, you've fully cleared it out!

418
00:09:07,882 --> 00:09:09,865
(spits)

419
00:09:09,865 --> 00:09:11,654
Wait, but that watermelon was seedless.

420
00:09:11,654 --> 00:09:12,487
(spits)

421
00:09:12,487 --> 00:09:13,535
- Now it's time to make the sales of the ship.

422
00:09:13,535 --> 00:09:15,683
Ah, okay here we go, just gotta hollow out this part first.

423
00:09:15,683 --> 00:09:17,302
This is great man, just, oh yeah.

424
00:09:17,302 --> 00:09:18,208
Oh!

425
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:19,333
Man I'm like an artist.

426
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:20,204
This is precision at its finest.

427
00:09:20,204 --> 00:09:23,124
I'm just being perfect with it bro, my angles are on point.

428
00:09:23,124 --> 00:09:24,886
- [Devan] It's definitely very pointy, what you're using.

429
00:09:24,886 --> 00:09:25,719
- Done!

430
00:09:25,719 --> 00:09:26,945
Perfect precision, it's all there and now,

431
00:09:26,945 --> 00:09:28,211
my perfect cubes.

432
00:09:28,211 --> 00:09:29,681
Yes, I nailed it.

433
00:09:29,681 --> 00:09:30,922
What's wrong, are you okay?

434
00:09:30,922 --> 00:09:31,867
- How did you do that?

435
00:09:31,867 --> 00:09:33,234
- Everything was a precise calculation

436
00:09:33,234 --> 00:09:34,394
all along the entire way.

437
00:09:34,394 --> 00:09:36,705
Now time to cut this up into the watermelon sails.

438
00:09:36,705 --> 00:09:39,329
This has got to be the coolest DIY we have ever done.

439
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:40,162
- Dude, it's awesome.

440
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:42,311
- The amount of detail on yours is just crazy.

441
00:09:42,311 --> 00:09:43,361
And let's see how this looks, you ready?

442
00:09:43,361 --> 00:09:45,284
But first, three second mic challenge.

443
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:47,550
We want to see if you can like this video in three seconds.

444
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,383
You ready?

445
00:09:48,383 --> 00:09:49,216
Here we go.

446
00:09:49,216 --> 00:09:52,283
- [Both Together] Three, two, one, done.

447
00:09:52,283 --> 00:09:54,200
Three, two, one, ta-da!

448
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,368
- These turned out so cool.

449
00:09:56,368 --> 00:09:57,815
I am so excited about these.

450
00:09:57,815 --> 00:09:59,861
- I think I crushed it, you get to comment down below.

451
00:09:59,861 --> 00:10:00,820
Who won this round?

452
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,132
And right now we're onto the next one.

453
00:10:02,132 --> 00:10:04,796
You challenged us to turn a carrot into a flute.

454
00:10:04,796 --> 00:10:07,379
(flute sounds)

455
00:10:12,162 --> 00:10:13,885
Okay, you know, all jokes aside we're gonna show you

456
00:10:13,885 --> 00:10:16,573
how to actually turn a carrot into a real, working flute.

457
00:10:16,573 --> 00:10:17,838
And right now, let's go.

458
00:10:17,838 --> 00:10:19,789
- First step is you gotta chop of the top.

459
00:10:19,789 --> 00:10:22,362
- And be very careful, even ask for someone else's help

460
00:10:22,362 --> 00:10:23,195
if you try this at home.

461
00:10:23,195 --> 00:10:24,854
As you do that, I gotta use my carrot-chucks

462
00:10:24,854 --> 00:10:26,346
for my carr-ate.

463
00:10:26,346 --> 00:10:27,601
- Oh, nice, whoa. - Here we go.

464
00:10:27,601 --> 00:10:28,434
- Be careful dude, be careful.

465
00:10:28,434 --> 00:10:30,328
- [Both Together] Oh!

466
00:10:30,328 --> 00:10:31,479
- This is the most important part.

467
00:10:31,479 --> 00:10:32,936
It's time to make the mouth piece.

468
00:10:32,936 --> 00:10:34,561
You gotta be very careful with how this goes.

469
00:10:34,561 --> 00:10:35,664
I'm gonna watch you do it first.

470
00:10:35,664 --> 00:10:37,365
So it all comes down to this right here,

471
00:10:37,365 --> 00:10:38,198
because if you mess this up,

472
00:10:38,198 --> 00:10:39,720
you will not have a flute, Devan.

473
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,166
And be very careful, again, when trying this at home.

474
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,464
Devan is a trained flute professional.

475
00:10:44,464 --> 00:10:46,502
Yo, dude, you got it!

476
00:10:46,502 --> 00:10:48,232
- I'm gonna make the reed, so I have to find

477
00:10:48,232 --> 00:10:49,973
a carrot that's going to fit this hole.

478
00:10:49,973 --> 00:10:51,280
- [Collins] I'm nailing this thing bro,

479
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,301
I think I'm actually gonna do this.

480
00:10:52,301 --> 00:10:53,189
- This doesn't fit.

481
00:10:53,189 --> 00:10:54,384
Oh, I think we have our carrot.

482
00:10:54,384 --> 00:10:55,217
Yes!

483
00:10:55,217 --> 00:10:57,839
A'right, now I have to cut off this side of it.

484
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:58,863
- Dude, what? - Look at it.

485
00:10:58,863 --> 00:11:00,209
- It might play a very unique sound.

486
00:11:00,209 --> 00:11:01,776
So that's kinda all I'm goin' for.

487
00:11:01,776 --> 00:11:03,751
- Now it's time for me to cut this off real quick.

488
00:11:03,751 --> 00:11:07,139
I recommend cutting it halfway, then pulling it out.

489
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:10,099
Cutting it in half, and that's your measurement.

490
00:11:10,099 --> 00:11:11,731
- This actually turned out so bad.

491
00:11:11,731 --> 00:11:12,666
I'm pretty disgraced right now,

492
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:14,220
I'm gonna have to leave the competition early.

493
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,053
- What?

494
00:11:15,053 --> 00:11:16,142
- So Devan, I have to take off in my carrot-copter.

495
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:16,975
- What?

496
00:11:16,975 --> 00:11:17,971
(helicopter sounds)

497
00:11:17,971 --> 00:11:19,243
Whoa dude, this way!

498
00:11:19,243 --> 00:11:20,619
And up!

499
00:11:20,619 --> 00:11:21,547
You okay?

500
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:23,771
Next step is to cut the reed in half at an angle.

501
00:11:23,771 --> 00:11:24,723
A'right, there we go.

502
00:11:24,723 --> 00:11:27,690
Now you stick this side in like that.

503
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:28,987
- Most flutes have multiple holes.

504
00:11:28,987 --> 00:11:30,171
My flute is special.

505
00:11:30,171 --> 00:11:31,027
One hole.

506
00:11:31,027 --> 00:11:32,009
It's a bunny flute, Devan,

507
00:11:32,009 --> 00:11:33,347
which means that you and I can't hear the sounds,

508
00:11:33,347 --> 00:11:35,660
but to bunnies, this is the best music they've ever heard.

509
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:38,489
(flute sounds)

510
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:39,401
- Hey, hey, Collins.

511
00:11:39,401 --> 00:11:40,725
Collins, Collins!

512
00:11:40,725 --> 00:11:42,275
You're summoning a ton of bunnies.

513
00:11:42,275 --> 00:11:43,361
Dude, Collins!

514
00:11:43,361 --> 00:11:44,672
- Whoa, snap!

515
00:11:44,672 --> 00:11:45,654
That's a lot of bunnies.

516
00:11:45,654 --> 00:11:47,047
- I know, you were totally zoned out.

517
00:11:47,047 --> 00:11:48,211
- I gotta add some extra holes.

518
00:11:48,211 --> 00:11:49,048
That'll fix the problem.

519
00:11:49,048 --> 00:11:51,364
- And now for my final step, I have to add holes.

520
00:11:51,364 --> 00:11:52,591
- As you're doing that, I'm gonna show you

521
00:11:52,591 --> 00:11:54,208
what two holes in a flute can do.

522
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:56,039
(electric guitar sounds)

523
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:57,647
Sounds like the wrong instrument, right?

524
00:11:57,647 --> 00:11:58,480
- Yeah it does.

525
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,479
- A'right here we go, a whole new instrument.

526
00:11:59,479 --> 00:12:00,890
Okay, here we go, now this should be better.

527
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,787
(trumpet sounds)

528
00:12:02,787 --> 00:12:03,769
Still the wrong instrument, okay.

529
00:12:03,769 --> 00:12:05,800
Let's try one last time, here we go.

530
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,842
(folk music plays)

531
00:12:06,842 --> 00:12:08,978
Devan, I accidentally broke it.

532
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,160
- Oh, what!

533
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,116
- It's all part of it, I will now play my flute upside down.

534
00:12:13,116 --> 00:12:15,187
(dissonant wind instruments)

535
00:12:15,187 --> 00:12:16,020
Yeah, that's pretty rough.

536
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,387
If I add three holes, I can create dub-step.

537
00:12:18,387 --> 00:12:19,298
Three, two, one!

538
00:12:19,298 --> 00:12:21,965
(dubstep music)

539
00:12:23,444 --> 00:12:24,277
- What?

540
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:26,231
- It was so powerful, it broke my carrot.

541
00:12:26,231 --> 00:12:27,223
- That was the greatest, what, dude, nice.

542
00:12:27,223 --> 00:12:28,623
- A'right, let's finish yours up,

543
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:30,672
and then we'll see if yours actaully plays like a flute.

544
00:12:30,672 --> 00:12:31,633
- Three! - Oh man!

545
00:12:31,633 --> 00:12:32,466
- Two, one.

546
00:12:32,466 --> 00:12:33,771
(flute sounds)

547
00:12:33,771 --> 00:12:34,643
- What!

548
00:12:34,643 --> 00:12:35,476
(flute sounds)

549
00:12:35,476 --> 00:12:37,261
- No way bro, you actually got it to work.

550
00:12:37,261 --> 00:12:38,909
- What, dude! - Whoa that is crazy.

551
00:12:38,909 --> 00:12:40,883
Comment down below, what's another vegetable we should use

552
00:12:40,883 --> 00:12:42,477
to make a flute out of it.

553
00:12:42,477 --> 00:12:43,536
And right now, we're on to the next one.

554
00:12:43,536 --> 00:12:44,409
Egg slingshot.

555
00:12:44,409 --> 00:12:45,242
- Wait, what?

556
00:12:45,242 --> 00:12:47,088
- N-n-no. - Three, two, one.

557
00:12:47,088 --> 00:12:48,965
- [Both Together] Oh snap.

558
00:12:48,965 --> 00:12:51,147
- Well that was a direct hit and guys, right now,

559
00:12:51,147 --> 00:12:53,046
we're gonna show you how to make some egg art.

560
00:12:53,046 --> 00:12:54,376
But first I gotta clean that off.

561
00:12:54,376 --> 00:12:57,663
- First step is to peel our hard boiled eggs.

562
00:12:57,663 --> 00:12:59,364
- Dude what is this technique you're using right now?

563
00:12:59,364 --> 00:13:00,249
What?

564
00:13:00,249 --> 00:13:01,525
- You know, just like that. - Dude that is so easy.

565
00:13:01,525 --> 00:13:02,628
- [Collins] That was like perfect!

566
00:13:02,628 --> 00:13:03,461
- [Devan] Here you go!

567
00:13:03,461 --> 00:13:04,380
- So you gotta put in the palm like this,

568
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,716
the thing is you gotta keep it there with no fingers.

569
00:13:05,716 --> 00:13:07,365
So even throughout all the movement, you gotta just.

570
00:13:07,365 --> 00:13:08,739
- I don't understand how you did it dude.

571
00:13:08,739 --> 00:13:11,821
- Oh! - Oh man, I split it open.

572
00:13:11,821 --> 00:13:12,891
I now have two eggs.

573
00:13:12,891 --> 00:13:14,476
Again, I gotta get down the technique.

574
00:13:14,476 --> 00:13:15,309
- Oh jeez.

575
00:13:15,309 --> 00:13:16,582
- [Both Together] Oh!

576
00:13:16,582 --> 00:13:17,415
- Man!

577
00:13:17,415 --> 00:13:18,314
I'm gonna use three eggs, I think this is how

578
00:13:18,314 --> 00:13:19,404
you de-shell some hard-boils.

579
00:13:19,404 --> 00:13:20,635
So you just juggle them like this,

580
00:13:20,635 --> 00:13:22,300
kind of do two at a time, and then try to.

581
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,133
Ahh!

582
00:13:24,844 --> 00:13:26,555
- Next step in my egg art is to cut the egg

583
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:28,991
only using dental floss and this toothpick.

584
00:13:28,991 --> 00:13:30,485
I've tied a knot around my toothpick,

585
00:13:30,485 --> 00:13:32,936
and now it's time to stick it in the middle of my egg.

586
00:13:32,936 --> 00:13:33,769
Dude.

587
00:13:33,769 --> 00:13:35,144
Almost there, almost there.

588
00:13:35,144 --> 00:13:36,291
- Ah!

589
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:37,374
Ah, I had it!

590
00:13:39,053 --> 00:13:39,886
Oh!

591
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:42,025
- And now it's time to take the top off of the egg.

592
00:13:42,025 --> 00:13:42,858
Dude!

593
00:13:42,858 --> 00:13:44,090
- Oh my gosh. - That's so good.

594
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,448
- Dude, I can't believe this dental floss actually worked.

595
00:13:46,448 --> 00:13:48,466
And you know what they say, for good dental care

596
00:13:48,466 --> 00:13:49,832
you need to floss twice a day.

597
00:13:49,832 --> 00:13:50,876
- Bro, I floss all the time.

598
00:13:50,876 --> 00:13:52,243
I got great dental care.

599
00:13:52,243 --> 00:13:54,131
- N-n-n-no, like dental floss, dude, not flossin'.

600
00:13:54,131 --> 00:13:54,964
- Flossin', yeah.

601
00:13:54,964 --> 00:13:55,797
- But it's not even near your teeth.

602
00:13:55,797 --> 00:13:58,310
- What are you talking about bro, it's like.

603
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:59,143
- What is that?

604
00:13:59,143 --> 00:14:00,078
- This is face flossin'.

605
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:02,128
Bonus hack, you guys can use a mason jar with water

606
00:14:02,128 --> 00:14:02,976
to peel an egg.

607
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:04,311
I'm droppin' knowledge.

608
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:05,234
Look, we drop it in.

609
00:14:05,234 --> 00:14:06,764
It's call the macarena mason jar.

610
00:14:06,764 --> 00:14:07,649
- Oh that sounds fun.

611
00:14:07,649 --> 00:14:08,756
- Apparently, you shake this up and de-shell the egg.

612
00:14:08,756 --> 00:14:09,589
So I guess we kinda.

613
00:14:09,589 --> 00:14:10,778
(shaking sounds)

614
00:14:10,778 --> 00:14:12,041
Oh my gosh dude, it's working.

615
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,424
No way!

616
00:14:13,424 --> 00:14:15,647
Dude, it totally de-shelled the egg.

617
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:17,673
- You never did the macarena once though, so.

618
00:14:17,673 --> 00:14:20,865
- Do the macarena, wait I forget, how do you do it?

619
00:14:20,865 --> 00:14:23,112
- Now it's time for me to grab some mayo, so, uh.

620
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,658
Wait, where's the mayo at Collins?

621
00:14:24,658 --> 00:14:26,640
- Oh, don't worry we'll just call the mayo-man.

622
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,473
- The mailman?

623
00:14:27,473 --> 00:14:28,606
What does the mailman have to do with mayo?

624
00:14:28,606 --> 00:14:30,022
- No, not the mailman, the mayo-man.

625
00:14:30,022 --> 00:14:30,855
- You're saying the same thing.

626
00:14:30,855 --> 00:14:31,688
- No, they're very different people.

627
00:14:31,688 --> 00:14:32,720
Let's see if I can find him, here we go.

628
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,766
Three, two, one.

629
00:14:33,766 --> 00:14:34,701
(chicken sounds)

630
00:14:34,701 --> 00:14:35,534
No.

631
00:14:35,534 --> 00:14:36,451
Maybe this guy, here we go.

632
00:14:36,451 --> 00:14:37,284
Three, two, one.

633
00:14:37,284 --> 00:14:38,117
- [Both Together] Oh!

634
00:14:38,117 --> 00:14:39,881
- You know what, ah, yeet!

635
00:14:39,881 --> 00:14:41,805
(glass smashes)

636
00:14:41,805 --> 00:14:43,658
Right now, time to summon the mayo-man.

637
00:14:43,658 --> 00:14:44,491
- A'right.

638
00:14:44,491 --> 00:14:45,324
- Three, two, one.

639
00:14:45,324 --> 00:14:46,730
(zap as portal opens)

640
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:47,563
- Oh!

641
00:14:47,563 --> 00:14:48,489
- Oh my gosh, dude it's working, it's working!

642
00:14:48,489 --> 00:14:49,498
Oh snap!

643
00:14:49,498 --> 00:14:50,364
- What!

644
00:14:50,364 --> 00:14:51,331
- Dude, it's the mayo-man.

645
00:14:51,331 --> 00:14:52,164
- No!

646
00:14:54,414 --> 00:14:55,428
(slapping sounds)

647
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:56,623
- Uh, oh ho ho!

648
00:14:56,623 --> 00:14:58,506
- Oh my gosh! - You've got mayo.

649
00:14:58,506 --> 00:15:00,491
- What is going on, oh no, oh no,

650
00:15:00,491 --> 00:15:02,423
oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no.

651
00:15:02,423 --> 00:15:03,811
(slapping sound)

652
00:15:03,811 --> 00:15:04,644
Ah!

653
00:15:05,644 --> 00:15:06,630
- You've got mayo.

654
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,532
- Yeah, I can tell.

655
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:09,460
(thunder sounds as portal opens)

656
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,830
- What was that?

657
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:12,478
I got mayo all over me.

658
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:14,191
- You asked for it bro, I told you this is how we get mayo.

659
00:15:14,191 --> 00:15:16,277
I am sticking by mayo-man, man.

660
00:15:16,277 --> 00:15:17,772
That is exactly what he delivered.

661
00:15:17,772 --> 00:15:18,811
- A'right, now that I have more mayonnaise

662
00:15:18,811 --> 00:15:21,062
than I could ever need, I'm gonna mix it up with my yolks.

663
00:15:21,062 --> 00:15:22,172
- Dude. - Sure!

664
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:23,159
- Ah, I'm getting egg juice in my eye.

665
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:24,307
A'right, so for mine, I'm gonna go

666
00:15:24,307 --> 00:15:25,484
for a very complex design here.

667
00:15:25,484 --> 00:15:26,659
Gonna stack my eggs.

668
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:27,971
Ah man, this is very difficult to stack an egg.

669
00:15:27,971 --> 00:15:29,588
Here we go, gonna go straight down, bloop!

670
00:15:29,588 --> 00:15:30,919
Pop out the bottom, gonna go for a toothpick.

671
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:31,930
So here we go, one.

672
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,131
And here we go, number two right here.

673
00:15:33,131 --> 00:15:35,334
And this is essential, will it stay balanced?

674
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:36,167
No.

675
00:15:36,167 --> 00:15:37,000
I know how to make it stay balanced, dummy.

676
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,833
You know how to make it stay balanced?

677
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:38,666
Lil legs.

678
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:39,499
A'right, here we go.

679
00:15:39,499 --> 00:15:40,332
He's now got two little legs.

680
00:15:40,332 --> 00:15:43,477
- Now it's time to add my yolk-mayo mixture into my egg.

681
00:15:43,477 --> 00:15:45,014
- Got it dude, it stays up bro!

682
00:15:45,014 --> 00:15:45,847
- What!

683
00:15:45,847 --> 00:15:46,773
- Some serious engineering.

684
00:15:46,773 --> 00:15:47,719
- [Both Together] No!

685
00:15:47,719 --> 00:15:48,614
- I've got the yolk-mayo mixture,

686
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,043
and now it's time to add the top.

687
00:15:50,043 --> 00:15:50,876
Oh!

688
00:15:50,876 --> 00:15:51,709
- [Devan] Oh!

689
00:15:51,709 --> 00:15:53,671
- Now it's time to break up this carrot and cut it up.

690
00:15:53,671 --> 00:15:55,379
- Ugh, I got it!

691
00:15:55,379 --> 00:15:56,457
- [Both Together] No!

692
00:15:56,457 --> 00:15:59,138
(chicken wails)

693
00:15:59,138 --> 00:16:00,593
- I gotta begin this all over again.

694
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:02,273
Oh wow, a'right, so now I'm gonna show you

695
00:16:02,273 --> 00:16:03,496
how to really pamper an egg.

696
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:04,659
Gonna do a little egg massage.

697
00:16:04,659 --> 00:16:05,791
Here we go, gonna put him in here,

698
00:16:05,791 --> 00:16:07,113
give him a lil tickle here like eeeee.

699
00:16:07,113 --> 00:16:07,946
Perfect.

700
00:16:07,946 --> 00:16:08,779
A'right, I got my face mask.

701
00:16:08,779 --> 00:16:10,904
- And I've cut my little feet, so now it's time

702
00:16:10,904 --> 00:16:13,319
to poke 'em with a toothpick and attach 'em to my egg.

703
00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:14,586
- Devan, I'm an innovator bro, look at this.

704
00:16:14,586 --> 00:16:15,527
Let's see, now we're just gonna

705
00:16:15,527 --> 00:16:16,639
place some face mask on my lil egg.

706
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,472
Just like that.

707
00:16:17,472 --> 00:16:18,773
Oh man, let the pampering begin.

708
00:16:18,773 --> 00:16:19,772
Oh, snap. - Boop!

709
00:16:19,772 --> 00:16:20,605
It's got little feet.

710
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:21,564
- This is the pampering spa treatment.

711
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:23,051
I get it at least four times a week.

712
00:16:23,051 --> 00:16:25,076
- Who throws you like that?

713
00:16:25,076 --> 00:16:26,528
Masseuse or body builders?

714
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:27,979
- They go like this and then they just

715
00:16:27,979 --> 00:16:29,191
throw you up in the air.

716
00:16:29,191 --> 00:16:31,055
And then up in the air.

717
00:16:31,055 --> 00:16:31,888
Like that.

718
00:16:31,888 --> 00:16:32,721
- Okay.

719
00:16:32,721 --> 00:16:34,091
Just cut out my beak and now it's time to attach it.

720
00:16:34,091 --> 00:16:35,884
- A'right, let's see if I can crack it open right now.

721
00:16:35,884 --> 00:16:37,974
I want to get something in very special in the middle.

722
00:16:37,974 --> 00:16:39,070
Oh, there is is.

723
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:41,092
Fully intact bro, here we go, we gotta get it out.

724
00:16:41,092 --> 00:16:43,454
And this is my favorite part of the entire egg.

725
00:16:43,454 --> 00:16:44,526
Bro, check this out.

726
00:16:44,526 --> 00:16:46,253
(flying sounds)

727
00:16:46,253 --> 00:16:47,086
- What happened?

728
00:16:47,086 --> 00:16:48,110
- No! - What?

729
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,554
- It just flew away!

730
00:16:49,554 --> 00:16:51,594
I gotta go catch my yolk, dingus 2000.

731
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:52,677
Let's get it.

732
00:16:54,343 --> 00:16:55,176
- Safe travels.

733
00:16:55,176 --> 00:16:56,964
Oh, hey, did you catch the golden yolk?

734
00:16:56,964 --> 00:16:59,782
- Forget the golden yolk bro, I lost my dingus.

735
00:16:59,782 --> 00:17:00,615
- No!

736
00:17:00,615 --> 00:17:02,208
- First time I broke it, this time I lost it,

737
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:03,176
what's gonna happen next?

738
00:17:03,176 --> 00:17:05,656
Well, I lost my dingus, and I couldn't catch the yolk.

739
00:17:05,656 --> 00:17:06,880
So right now, let's continue on.

740
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,681
- One eye, two eye, it is done!

741
00:17:08,681 --> 00:17:09,696
- A'right here's the big reveal.

742
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:10,938
Dude, mine turned out awesome.

743
00:17:10,938 --> 00:17:13,073
- Dude, I know, it's actually the best you've ever made.

744
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,409
- [Both Together] Three, two.

745
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:17,004
- W-w-wait, you wanna win a 15 minute video call

746
00:17:17,004 --> 00:17:20,801
with Devan and I, text the word "yum" to 81800 right now.

747
00:17:20,801 --> 00:17:22,981
So pause the video, text the word "yum" to 81800

748
00:17:22,981 --> 00:17:24,798
you will automatically be entered in to win.

749
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:25,854
- [Both Together] Three, two, one,

750
00:17:25,854 --> 00:17:27,217
ta-da!

751
00:17:27,217 --> 00:17:28,811
- [Collins] Come on man, come one!

752
00:17:28,811 --> 00:17:29,644
- [Devan] I know, I know.

753
00:17:29,644 --> 00:17:30,757
- So you get to comment down below.

754
00:17:30,757 --> 00:17:32,014
Who made better egg art?

755
00:17:32,014 --> 00:17:33,989
Right now, we're onto the next one.

756
00:17:33,989 --> 00:17:37,080
You challenged us (slice) to make a massive watermelon ring.

757
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,560
(slice) C'mon!

758
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,981
- What is going on?

759
00:17:39,981 --> 00:17:41,178
- Okay, you gotta help me out bro, you gotta help me out.

760
00:17:41,178 --> 00:17:44,503
- Okay, okay. - You gotta go fast, bro.

761
00:17:44,503 --> 00:17:46,068
- H'ya!

762
00:17:46,068 --> 00:17:46,972
(slice)

763
00:17:46,972 --> 00:17:47,877
- Okay, let's go make it.

764
00:17:47,877 --> 00:17:50,172
Before we can build we gotta cut off the top and the bottom.

765
00:17:50,172 --> 00:17:51,925
And first off, we got our whoost-off.

766
00:17:51,925 --> 00:17:54,358
So if you do this at home, be very, very careful.

767
00:17:54,358 --> 00:17:55,191
Even ask for someone else's help,

768
00:17:55,191 --> 00:17:57,371
or maybe don't even do it if you don't feel comfortable.

769
00:17:57,371 --> 00:17:59,235
So right now, I'm gonna do this with a shredder.

770
00:17:59,235 --> 00:18:00,298
Because technically you gotta peel it.

771
00:18:00,298 --> 00:18:01,131
- Wait, what?

772
00:18:01,131 --> 00:18:02,019
I thought first off was whoost-off?

773
00:18:02,019 --> 00:18:03,700
- Yeah well first off for you was whoost-off,

774
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,810
first off for me is shred-off.

775
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:06,643
- A'right.

776
00:18:06,643 --> 00:18:07,476
- The shred-off.

777
00:18:07,476 --> 00:18:08,309
Shred, schwd, shhd-off.

778
00:18:08,309 --> 00:18:09,142
Aw yeah.

779
00:18:09,142 --> 00:18:10,031
I'm gonna win this.

780
00:18:10,031 --> 00:18:11,481
- I love your confidence every time.

781
00:18:11,481 --> 00:18:13,559
- You could absolutely play this like a violin.

782
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,552
(violin sounds)

783
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:18,845
(crowd cheering)

784
00:18:18,845 --> 00:18:20,477
- Now it's time to create the iconic shape.

785
00:18:20,477 --> 00:18:23,260
Gonna put the stencil down on top like this.

786
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,709
And you just start shaving the watermelon like this.

787
00:18:25,709 --> 00:18:27,219
- My knife is a lot smaller than your knife bro,

788
00:18:27,219 --> 00:18:28,052
I don't know how this happened.

789
00:18:28,052 --> 00:18:29,251
Okay, so I guess this goes like this.

790
00:18:29,251 --> 00:18:30,084
Perfect!

791
00:18:30,084 --> 00:18:31,846
You know what, Devan? As you waste your time there,

792
00:18:31,846 --> 00:18:32,679
I've got a better tool.

793
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:33,512
A chisel.

794
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:34,345
- How are you gonna use that?

795
00:18:34,345 --> 00:18:35,178
- Oh, trust me bro.

796
00:18:35,178 --> 00:18:36,988
Now I just have to speed things up a little bit, so,

797
00:18:36,988 --> 00:18:38,155
let's do this.

798
00:18:39,459 --> 00:18:40,292
- A'right, well I guess I'm just gonna--

799
00:18:40,292 --> 00:18:42,296
dude, what are you doing?

800
00:18:42,296 --> 00:18:43,791
How are you doing that?

801
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:45,519
I wish I could do that.

802
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:46,902
Seriously bro?

803
00:18:46,902 --> 00:18:49,314
Fine, a'right, well I guess I have to go pretty quick here.

804
00:18:49,314 --> 00:18:51,539
A'right, just gotta cut down the sides here.

805
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:52,500
- Boom, and done!

806
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,406
Masterpiece.

807
00:18:53,406 --> 00:18:55,060
Speed equals quality.

808
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,076
Well, I guess my little outline on the top is over,

809
00:18:57,076 --> 00:18:58,534
so just gonna have to free hand it.

810
00:18:58,534 --> 00:18:59,772
Kinda copy along.

811
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:00,605
Oh!

812
00:19:00,605 --> 00:19:01,438
Oh-ho-ho so smooth.

813
00:19:01,438 --> 00:19:03,109
I feel like I'm missing something shape-wise right now.

814
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:03,942
What shape is yours?

815
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:04,775
- [Devan] An octagon.

816
00:19:04,775 --> 00:19:05,721
- Square.

817
00:19:05,721 --> 00:19:07,695
Oh, that' last one might'a been a bit too much off the face.

818
00:19:07,695 --> 00:19:09,864
It's lookin' more like a club than it (laughs)

819
00:19:09,864 --> 00:19:10,783
than a pop.

820
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:12,014
Bro, that's taking you forever.

821
00:19:12,014 --> 00:19:12,879
- Well what time is it?

822
00:19:12,879 --> 00:19:14,951
- It's exactly melon-time!

823
00:19:14,951 --> 00:19:16,238
(techno music plays)

824
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,518
- So basically three-fifteen?

825
00:19:17,518 --> 00:19:19,491
- Yeah, but it's way more fun to say melon-time.

826
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,589
The only down-side is that it's a little hard on the wrist.

827
00:19:21,589 --> 00:19:23,442
- Well, yeah it's a flippin' melon.

828
00:19:23,442 --> 00:19:25,188
- Okay, well just because you don't have the melon 4000.

829
00:19:25,188 --> 00:19:26,088
- You have the four?

830
00:19:26,088 --> 00:19:27,347
- I have the 4000.

831
00:19:27,347 --> 00:19:28,489
- But is it waterproof?

832
00:19:28,489 --> 00:19:29,322
- It's a melon.

833
00:19:29,322 --> 00:19:30,207
A watermelon.

834
00:19:30,207 --> 00:19:31,792
No it's not waterproof, Devan.

835
00:19:31,792 --> 00:19:32,740
It is water!

836
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,709
Bro are you close yet?

837
00:19:33,709 --> 00:19:34,685
- [Devan] Yeah, I'm pretty much done.

838
00:19:34,685 --> 00:19:36,218
- A'right well, you know I'm gonna put the finishing touches

839
00:19:36,218 --> 00:19:38,189
on mine, and right now let's get ready for the finale.

840
00:19:38,189 --> 00:19:40,698
Yours is so perfect, oh my gosh.

841
00:19:40,698 --> 00:19:41,789
A'right, here's the big reveal.

- [Both Together] Three, two, One.

849
00:19:52,151 --> 00:19:53,422
Ta-da!

850
00:19:53,422 --> 00:19:54,255
- Dude!

851
00:19:54,255 --> 00:19:56,203
- Wow, bro, you just went voom, voom, voom, voom, voom!

852
00:19:56,203 --> 00:19:57,346
You get to comment down below.

853
00:19:57,346 --> 00:19:59,039
Who made a better watermelon ring?

854
00:19:59,039 --> 00:19:59,938
Super sonic slap!

855
00:19:59,938 --> 00:20:01,593
(boom)

856
00:20:01,593 --> 00:20:02,545
Check this out.

857
00:20:02,545 --> 00:20:03,378
- Whoa.

858
00:20:03,378 --> 00:20:04,345
(boom)

859
00:20:04,345 --> 00:20:05,344
- Wow. - Oh!
