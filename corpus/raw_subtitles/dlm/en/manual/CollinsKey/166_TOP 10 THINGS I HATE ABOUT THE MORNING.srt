1
00:00:00,068 --> 00:00:00,901
- What's up guys?

2
00:00:00,901 --> 00:00:03,358
It's Collins Key and welcome to the Thursday vlog.

3
00:00:03,358 --> 00:00:05,521
Now for today's video I wanted to do something

4
00:00:05,521 --> 00:00:07,599
that I don't normally do and I wanted to let you guys know

5
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:10,612
10 reasons that I hate waking up in the morning.

6
00:00:10,612 --> 00:00:12,525
So if you guys are not a fan of waking up in the morning

7
00:00:12,525 --> 00:00:14,078
let me know by liking this video

8
00:00:14,078 --> 00:00:17,588
and without further ado, let's just jump right into it.

9
00:00:17,588 --> 00:00:18,897
Let's do it. (laughing)

10
00:00:18,897 --> 00:00:20,649
Number one, alarm clocks.

11
00:00:20,649 --> 00:00:23,746
(alarm blaring)

12
00:00:23,746 --> 00:00:24,968
(rhythmic electronic music)

13
00:00:24,968 --> 00:00:26,154
Good morning.

14
00:00:26,154 --> 00:00:28,153
Number two, being woken up in the middle

15
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:29,820
of an awesome dream.

16
00:00:30,891 --> 00:00:34,918
- The winner of the one million dollars

17
00:00:34,918 --> 00:00:39,085
and the star of a headline show in Las Vegas is...

18
00:00:40,576 --> 00:00:41,950
Collins Key!

19
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:44,262
(audience applauding and yelling)

20
00:00:44,262 --> 00:00:46,095
Thank you guys so much.

21
00:00:46,095 --> 00:00:47,933
- Yes, I won!

22
00:00:47,933 --> 00:00:48,850
Wooo, yeah!

23
00:00:50,661 --> 00:00:52,045
This is awkward.

24
00:00:52,045 --> 00:00:54,781
Number three. (smooching)

25
00:00:54,781 --> 00:00:58,418
The absolute worst, bad hair days.

26
00:00:58,418 --> 00:00:59,850
Here we go.

27
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,274
(rubbing palms together)

28
00:01:01,274 --> 00:01:03,392
Hope this goes well.

29
00:01:03,392 --> 00:01:04,373
Over here.

30
00:01:04,373 --> 00:01:05,597
All right, we're off to a great start.

31
00:01:05,597 --> 00:01:06,904
Messy, all good.

32
00:01:06,904 --> 00:01:10,571
And just one more finishing touch, and done.

33
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:14,232
What the heck happened?

34
00:01:14,232 --> 00:01:17,329
Number four, trying to pick out what you're gonna wear.

35
00:01:17,329 --> 00:01:18,754
I literally have nothing to wear,

36
00:01:18,754 --> 00:01:21,665
I guess I'll just have to wear this.

37
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:23,629
(rhythmic electronic music)

38
00:01:23,629 --> 00:01:25,500
(laughing)

39
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,024
Number five, missing your alarm.

40
00:01:28,024 --> 00:01:31,046
(alarm blaring)

41
00:01:31,046 --> 00:01:33,292
- [Man] One eternity later.

42
00:01:33,292 --> 00:01:35,739
(alarm blaring)

43
00:01:35,739 --> 00:01:37,906
- Oh my god, I am so late!

44
00:01:38,794 --> 00:01:42,009
Number six, not having time to eat breakfast.

45
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:43,109
(throat clearing)

46
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:44,904
My favorite meal of the day.

47
00:01:44,904 --> 00:01:47,186
- [Man] Collins, what are you doing, you've gotta go!

48
00:01:47,186 --> 00:01:48,488
(Devan roars)

49
00:01:48,488 --> 00:01:50,280
- Oh, dude, dude!

50
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,443
(laughing)

51
00:01:51,443 --> 00:01:53,642
Number seven, waking up with a giant beam

52
00:01:53,642 --> 00:01:56,822
of sunlight hitting you right in the eyes.

53
00:01:56,822 --> 00:01:59,642
Never let that happen because oh man, that hurts.

54
00:01:59,642 --> 00:02:00,742
Oh, that really does hurt.

55
00:02:00,742 --> 00:02:02,486
Number eight, when your family tries to have

56
00:02:02,486 --> 00:02:05,341
a full on conversation with you, doesn't work.

57
00:02:05,341 --> 00:02:08,646
(rhythmic electronic music)

58
00:02:08,646 --> 00:02:10,280
- Yo, Collins, check it out!

59
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,212
This super scrubber has like super poke technology.

60
00:02:13,212 --> 00:02:16,023
It has like super, I could swift your arm and your face.

61
00:02:16,023 --> 00:02:18,064
And dude, why are you giving me this face?

62
00:02:18,064 --> 00:02:19,046
See like. (whooping)

63
00:02:19,046 --> 00:02:20,350
- Go away!

64
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,389
(laughing)

65
00:02:22,389 --> 00:02:24,756
Number nine, finding out that people played a prank on you

66
00:02:24,756 --> 00:02:26,676
while you were sleeping.

67
00:02:26,676 --> 00:02:28,548
- [Devan] Oh my gosh, dude.

68
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:31,362
Someone said I farted on your face.

69
00:02:31,362 --> 00:02:32,993
- What, did you do this to me?

70
00:02:32,993 --> 00:02:34,782
- I didn't do it, no. - Bro.

71
00:02:34,782 --> 00:02:36,003
- [Devan] Why are you looking at me, man?

72
00:02:36,003 --> 00:02:38,732
- And last but not least, number 10.

73
00:02:38,732 --> 00:02:41,018
When you finally have the chance to sleep in,

74
00:02:41,018 --> 00:02:44,607
but everyone decides to be super loud that day.

75
00:02:44,607 --> 00:02:48,774
(pots banging) (yelling)

76
00:02:50,999 --> 00:02:53,617
(alarm blaring)

77
00:02:53,617 --> 00:02:56,147
(pots banging) (yelling)

78
00:02:56,147 --> 00:02:57,772
Guys, be quiet!

79
00:02:57,772 --> 00:02:58,684
(yelling in foreign language)

80
00:02:58,684 --> 00:03:00,678
- You, stop it!

81
00:03:00,678 --> 00:03:02,062
(yelling in foreign language)

82
00:03:02,062 --> 00:03:02,895
(laughing) (pots banging)

83
00:03:02,895 --> 00:03:04,050

94

(fingers snapping)

95
00:03:25,007 --> 00:03:26,229
- [Man] You don't have time to eat right now.

96
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:27,167
(Devan roars)

97
00:03:27,167 --> 00:03:28,000
(laughing)
