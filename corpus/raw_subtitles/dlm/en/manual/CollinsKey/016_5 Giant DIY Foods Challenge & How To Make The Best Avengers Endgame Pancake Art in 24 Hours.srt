1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,960
- You challenged us to make giant food,

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,330
and check out this pizza!

3
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,750
You challenged us to make a giant slice of pizza,

4
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:07,140
so right now, let's go!

5
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,567
- [Devan] I'm kicking it off by kneading my dough.

6
00:00:08,567 --> 00:00:10,415
- And I'm kicking it off with some sauce.

7
00:00:10,415 --> 00:00:11,248
It's time to pulverize.

8
00:00:11,248 --> 00:00:12,640
- What, you're pulverizing tomatoes?

9
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,473
- [Collin] Yep, pulverizing tomatoes

10
00:00:13,473 --> 00:00:15,903
to see that it needs a real, authentic juicy sauce.

11
00:00:15,903 --> 00:00:17,220
- We're gonna use this thing here to mash it all up.

12
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,053
- Whoa, whoa.

13
00:00:18,053 --> 00:00:19,940
- So again, you know what, I gotta put this away

14
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,510
and show you how to really do the sauce.

15
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,380
First, you start off with the tomatoes.

16
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:24,213
- Okay well you know what,

17
00:00:24,213 --> 00:00:25,750
instead of dicing them, I'm gonna use lil tomatoes

18
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,700
'cause like four little tomatoes equals one big tomato.

19
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,580
So boom, give them little squeezes.

20
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,140
- Can you just squeeze it with the other hand?

21
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,810
- Yeah, sure, sure, sure, three, two, one, oh!

22
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:34,580
- I thought that would be better!

23
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:35,820
- I'm sorry, man, I'm not left handed.

24
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,490
- Next step is to dice up the onion

25
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:39,220
and man, it's already making me cry.

26
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,730
Next step is to add all this in to the sauce bowl.

27
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:44,160
Alright, so my eyes are finally starting to clear up,

28
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,410
so I'm gonna add my balsamic and my olive oil.

29
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,393
- [Collin] So we're going to add all of the balsamic.

30
00:00:48,393 --> 00:00:50,290
- Just a little bit, Collin, it's a seasoning.

31
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:51,310
- [Collin] How much of the olive oil?

32
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:52,143
- [Devan] Just a little bit.

33
00:00:52,143 --> 00:00:52,976
- [Collin] You gotta try to absorb

34
00:00:52,976 --> 00:00:54,250
some of the balsamic and olive oil right now

35
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,083
'cause it's a lot in there.

36
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:55,916
So we'll add some cheese into my sauce.

37
00:00:55,916 --> 00:00:56,749
- Wait, I'm sorry-

38
00:00:56,749 --> 00:00:57,582
- This is an innovation Devan.

39
00:00:57,582 --> 00:01:00,059
Time to add some oregano, gonna get a big old scoop in here.

40
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:00,892
We're just gonna go like this.

41
00:01:00,892 --> 00:01:01,900
- Now back to the dough.

42
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,440
- The thing is, Devan, you're using pre-made dough.

43
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,720
I'm making my dough from scratch.

44
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,313
So I need one cup of flour right here.

45
00:01:06,313 --> 00:01:07,910
This is way that you win, Devan.

46
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,410
Next up, we just gotta dash of salt.

47
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:12,090
So here we go, just a dash of salt.

48
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,500
The winning touch, some cheese.

49
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,580
We're gonna have cheesy crust right here.

50
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,500
Alright, now it's time to knead out my dough.

51
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,203
So here we go, three, two, one, oh there we go, perfect.

52
00:01:20,203 --> 00:01:21,603
I gotta say, man, my dough is not turning out,

53
00:01:21,603 --> 00:01:23,550
so I got a different strategy, now yeet!

54
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,910
- Whoa! - Oh snap, wait a minute, bro.

55
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:27,760
The yeet looks like a self portrait of me, man.

56
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,420
Now that that's over, time to grab the pre-made dough.

57
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,290
- Wait a second, what are you doing?

58
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:33,450
- I'm using pre-made dough, Devan.

59
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,530
'Cause my other dough, it didn't quite work right.

60
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:36,647
- What? - Wrong step.

61
00:01:36,647 --> 00:01:37,480
Gotta get the flour on here first.

62
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,310
So here we go, flour on first like this.

63
00:01:40,843 --> 00:01:42,600
- [Devan] Now it's time to put it in a pan

64
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,433
and start shaping it.

65
00:01:43,433 --> 00:01:44,950
- [Collin] And I'm gonna add some cheese to this crust,

66
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:45,840
because unfortunately this one doesn't

67
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,370
have anymore cheese in it, so here we go, man.

68
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,870
cheesy crust, it'll be an experiment,

69
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,170
but I think it's gonna work out really well.

70
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:51,760
- [Devan] So basically, you just wanna make this

71
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,853
into a triangle shape.

72
00:01:53,853 --> 00:01:54,686
(laughing)

73
00:01:54,686 --> 00:01:55,519
What are you doing?

74
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:56,352
- It just looks really funny.

75
00:01:56,352 --> 00:01:57,185
It looks like you're kneading a rug.

76
00:01:57,185 --> 00:01:58,018
- [Devan] My dough is done,

77
00:01:58,018 --> 00:01:59,330
and now it's time to turn this in to the giant pizza slice.

78
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:01,440
And now it's time to move on to the toppings.

79
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,833
I'm gonna start with the tomato sauce.

80
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:04,690
Just gotta lather it on here.

81
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:05,523
- [Collin] See the thing is, Devan,

82
00:02:05,523 --> 00:02:08,310
I'm gonna be creating my pizza with a full walled crust.

83
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,770
I can basically have a tomato soup inside my pizza slice.

84
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,540
- [Devan] Collin, that looks like a swimming pool!

85
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,080
- Maybe like a community swimming pool.

86
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,679
- [Devan] Next steps is we add the cheese.

87
00:02:15,679 --> 00:02:17,147
- [Collin] The cheese, okay, there we go.

88
00:02:17,147 --> 00:02:19,330
- [Devan] You just wanna lightly sprinkle it on top,

89
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:20,163
just like this.

90
00:02:20,163 --> 00:02:21,660
- [Collin] Boom, cheese is on.

91
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,110
- [Devan] Now it's time for the final toppings.

92
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,540
- I'm gonna be kicking this off with pepperoni,

93
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,990
so here we go, the thing about a giant pizza,

94
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:26,940
it needs some giant toppings.

95
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,060
So here we go, we're gonna get some broccoli.

96
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,670
Oh, look, love a little broccoli mouth, man!

97
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,130
- No one loves broccoli on pizza.

98
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:32,440
- Everyone loves broccoli on pizza.

99
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,150
You know what they love more than broccoli on pizza?

100
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,130
Pineapple, boom, there we go. - What?

101
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:36,963
- Pineapple pizza.

102
00:02:36,963 --> 00:02:38,410
- Okay, I know for a fact,

103
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:40,533
nobody likes pineapple on pizza.

104
00:02:40,533 --> 00:02:43,014
- Oh boy, dude, look at this, brother.

105
00:02:43,014 --> 00:02:44,510
This is an innovation on the sauce.

106
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:45,920
You've heard pineapple on the pizza,

107
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,690
never pineapple juice in pizza before, look at this, man.

108
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,440
- Yeah, nobody likes soggy pizza, Collin.

109
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,903
- [Collin] Pizza is almost done.

110
00:02:51,903 --> 00:02:53,490
- It's gonna be okay, pizza, it's gonna be okay.

111
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:54,410
Next up, we chuck these in the oven.

112
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:55,680
- Alright, here we go!

113
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,040
- Oh, not actually chuck, don't actually throw them.

114
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,090
We place them in the oven gently.

115
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,873
- Oh, okay, gotcha, then we'll find out how they turn out.

116
00:03:01,873 --> 00:03:04,610
That is the largest piece of pizza I have ever seen

117
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,600
and it is steaming hot, so here's the big reveal.

118
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,490
- [Both] Ready, set, go, ta da, dude!

119
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:13,440
- That is a perfect slice of pizza man!

120
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,330
- These look great.

121
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:15,400
- [Collin] You get to comment down below.

122
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,650
Whose giant piece of pizza

123
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:17,970
do you think is gonna taste better?

124
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:19,340
- Dude, how am I gonna eat this?

125
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,173
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, bro!

126
00:03:20,173 --> 00:03:21,420
We'll be doing that at the end of the video,

127
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,880
and right now we're on to the next one.

128
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,713
You challenged us to make

129
00:03:23,713 --> 00:03:25,841
a giant chicken nugget from Chick-fil-A, so let's go.

130
00:03:25,841 --> 00:03:28,260
My chicken nugget, I'm using a jackfruit.

131
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,730
- What, I'm using chicken like a normal person.

132
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:31,923
- Yeah, well see I got a crazy chicken nugget

133
00:03:31,923 --> 00:03:33,990
that's not even made out of chicken, bro.

134
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,330
It's fhicken, fake chicken.

135
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:39,040
Three, two, one, there we, wow!

136
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,873
- [Devan] Whoa!

137
00:03:39,873 --> 00:03:41,030
- [Collin] This, Devan, is a jackfruit,

138
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,680
that I am seeing for the first time as well.

139
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,730
- [Devan] Next up, I'm gonna add these eggs here.

140
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:45,940
- Next up, I gotta remove the meat.

141
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,290
So I gotta chisel here, and here we go.

142
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,380
It's gonna go in to it and just

143
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,480
remove some good meat right now.

144
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,320
So here we go, it's gonna go in like that, perfect.

145
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,190
This does not come out easily.

146
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,470
Maybe if I pulverize it first?

147
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,050
- [Devan] You never cease to surprise me.

148
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:57,100
- That's my goal, Devan, I never cease to do anything.

149
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,820
- [Devan] I'm mixing things up over here, dude.

150
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,670
- Let's see if it'll dump out.

151
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,215
Three, two, one, there we go!

152
00:04:01,215 --> 00:04:02,950
- That, oh!

153
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:05,590
Alright, next up is for me to add the flour.

154
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,791
I think I have to add three cups of this.

155
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:10,198
- And I got another jackfruit, I lost a jackfruit.

156
00:04:10,198 --> 00:04:11,587
- [Devan] I'm gonna mix as I go,

157
00:04:11,587 --> 00:04:13,139
because this is a lot of flour.

158
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:14,156
- We got all the jackfruit meat,

159
00:04:14,156 --> 00:04:15,758
and now it's time to get rid of this, so ye!

160
00:04:15,758 --> 00:04:17,829
- Whoa, not with that!

161
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:20,076
Last cup of flour and time to get in with my hands.

162
00:04:20,076 --> 00:04:21,670
- As you do that, time for me to make my sauce.

163
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,410
So we're gonna kick it off right now with some honey.

164
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,560
Squeet, squeet, squeet, yo, that's the sound

165
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,940
of a new yeet, a squeeze yeet.

166
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,140
You've heard of honey mustard dipping sauce, but deet.

167
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,370
We're doing mayonnaise dipping sauce with honey.

168
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:34,200
Here we go, three, two, well there we go.

169
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,510
Boom, it's all coming at like that, nicely done.

170
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,640
Except we are gonna add some mustard,

171
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,837
because you can't have a great sauce without some mustard.

172
00:04:38,837 --> 00:04:40,870
We got some hot sauce because of course, as you know,

173
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,100
I love spice, so what do we do?

174
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,173
Just a dash of sriracha in here, oh man!

175
00:04:44,173 --> 00:04:46,090
Hey, Devan, I have a perfect name for this sauce.

176
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,460
Because it helped create a new yeet,

177
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,130
we'll call this the squeet sauce.

178
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:50,520
'Cause if you eat it, it'll make a squeet.

179
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,440
You'll be squeeting everywhere.

180
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,050
For my final step, got a whole bunch of eggs.

181
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,440
I'm gonna crack them open like this, here we go.

182
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,680
One handed crack, oh man chef school watch out.

183
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,620
I just graduated.

184
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,730
- [Devan] And as you're doing that,

185
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,040
I'm gonna add the breadcrumbs.

186
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,600
- We're gonna do two cups of flour.

187
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,870
And I've actually found out recently,

188
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,230
my hand is exactly one cup of flour.

189
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,250
This is an exact measurement.

190
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,670
I got very lucky with my hands.

191
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,020
- Wait, really, can we test this?

192
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,252
- [Collin] One cup of flour.

193
00:05:11,252 --> 00:05:13,903
And then here we go, I'm gonna dump it in.

194
00:05:13,903 --> 00:05:15,240
- [Devan] No way, when did you find this out?

195
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,300
- I've kinda known since birth.

196
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,130
- [Devan] Time to make my thousand island sauce.

197
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,350
I'm adding ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise.

198
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,170
- [Collin] The eggs and the flour's mixing together, oh boy.

199
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:23,440
- [Devan] My dipping sauce is done.

200
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,880
Now it's time to shape the nugget.

201
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,713
- And my jackfruit is done,

202
00:05:25,713 --> 00:05:27,440
so now I gotta put my breadcrumbs down.

203
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,273
- Whoa.

204
00:05:28,273 --> 00:05:29,820
- Yeet, alright, so let's get the

205
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:30,653
breadcrumbs out like that, yeet.

206
00:05:30,653 --> 00:05:32,040
- [Devan] That was really cool, bro.

207
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,873
It's keeping its shape and everything.

208
00:05:32,873 --> 00:05:34,390
- [Collin] So here we go, nice.

209
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,374
- [Devan] Alright and now,

210
00:05:35,374 --> 00:05:36,330
it's time to shape it in to the nugget.

211
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,803
- Oh man, bro, I'm gonna get it all breaded up.

212
00:05:37,803 --> 00:05:39,480
Hold on, let's get it all breaded up.

213
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,820
Oh, dude, I'm getting some extra bread.

214
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,280
I got some croissants, here we go.

215
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,405
Devan, so these croissants is gonna add the extra bread.

216
00:05:44,405 --> 00:05:45,293
So I'm just gonna smash them up well.

217
00:05:45,293 --> 00:05:46,760
- [Devan] Collin, you know those are

218
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,950
croutons, not croissants, right?

219
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:49,783
- Wait what?

220
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:51,240
- [Devan] Alright, two eggs for my egg wash.

221
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,650
- [Collin] I've got a better way of doing an egg wash

222
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:54,290
where you take the eggs, put it on a sponge,

223
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:56,196
and then you just wash, wash, wash, wash, wash like this.

224
00:05:56,196 --> 00:05:57,090
You just gotta wash it all around.

225
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,130
- You took what I said literally, Collin.

226
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,390
- I always do, Devan.

227
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:01,970
That's the way you take life, literally.

228
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,050
- [Devan] The egg wash really helps

229
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,187
the breadcrumbs stick to the nugget.

230
00:06:04,187 --> 00:06:06,180
- [Collin] It's a nugget volcano, man, here we go.

231
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,030
It's gonna erupt, it's gonna erupt!

232
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:09,120
Watch out man, whoa!

233
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,750
That was some hot lava squeets, I mean nuggets.

234
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,930
- [Devan] And finally I add breadcrumbs to the top.

235
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,450
- [Collin] And I'm gonna add honey to the top,

236
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:16,550
'cause I don't have another step to do

237
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,420
and I wanna be doing another step, so here we go.

238
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,420
I think I'm definitely doing a solid on this one.

239
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,820
- Now it's time for the most important part.

240
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,270
We're gonna pop it in the oven and see how it turns out.

241
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,970
- Our giant chicken nuggets are done and bro,

242
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:28,200
yours is massive, so here's the big reveal.

243
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,116
- [Both] Ready, set, go, ta da!

244
00:06:30,116 --> 00:06:32,710
- [Collin] That is so big, bro.

245
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:33,543
You get to comment down below,

246
00:06:33,543 --> 00:06:34,383
whose do you think will taste better?

247
00:06:34,383 --> 00:06:36,630
Because we'll be eating them at the end of the video.

248
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,030
You challenged us to make a giant

249
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,350
Crunchwrap Supreme from Taco Bell, so let's go.

250
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,780
First ingredient for my Crunchwrap Supreme

251
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,993
is a whole bunch of beef, so here we go.

252
00:06:42,993 --> 00:06:44,680
Just gonna dump this in, whoa!

253
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,320
Alright, well beef is in.

254
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,617
Next up, we got some salsa,

255
00:06:47,617 --> 00:06:48,890
because we gotta have some salsa-ed beef

256
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:49,723
for your Crunchwrap Supreme.

257
00:06:49,723 --> 00:06:52,223
I got a block of cheese I'm just gonna add here, so let-

258
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,913
- Oh my!

259
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:56,200
- Well we got the counter all sterilized.

260
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,500
That was almost it again.

261
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,954
So we're just gonna pop this in here like this.

262
00:06:58,954 --> 00:07:00,010
That should be perfect, here we go.

263
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:01,040
Next up, we gotta add in just a

264
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,810
little bit more salsa on top, there we go.

265
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:05,260
Now I gotta turn it up to full heat and roast it.

266
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,880
- Whoa, so I'm starting the right way,

267
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,100
which is with the vegetables.

268
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,130
- That's debatable, Devan.

269
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:13,388
See, right now, I gotta mix up

270
00:07:13,388 --> 00:07:14,221
all my meat, my cheese, and my salsa.

271
00:07:14,221 --> 00:07:16,240
- Is that a piece of hair, oh no, it's just cheese.

272
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,540
- [Collin] You kinda scared me there for a second.

273
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,010
I'm like, I cannot have hair in my cheese.

274
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,370
Next up, I gotta prime the workstation

275
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,540
as I prepare for my giant Crunchwrap Supreme case.

276
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,716
I want my Crunchwrap Supreme to be

277
00:07:23,716 --> 00:07:25,570
Crunchwrap Supreme salsa edition.

278
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,840
I want to do a little dance.

279
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,060
- [Devan] It's time to cut up these onions,

280
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,010
and dude, my eyes are already watering.

281
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:31,710
Is this not affecting you at all?

282
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:32,543
- [Collin] It's not affecting me.

283
00:07:32,543 --> 00:07:33,660
See I've already experienced it once Devan,

284
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,640
so I'm now immune to it, it's time for Frisbee time.

285
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,540
Here we go, three, two, one, frisbee time!

286
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,560
- Are you gonna use that tortilla?

287
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,070
- Uh, where'd it go, oh, here it is, okay got it.

288
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:43,090
Oh man, my beef is coming along nicely man.

289
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:45,330
It's sizzling, you can hear it, ssh.

290
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:46,190
- That's like a gurgle.

291
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,740
Alright next step for me is adding the meat.

292
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,573
- [Collin] And next step for me

293
00:07:48,573 --> 00:07:50,140
is using the cheese as glue.

294
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,510
There's a little bit on that side.

295
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,560
- [Devan] You hear the sizzle, bro?

296
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,973
I'm gonna add my seasoning, oh.

297
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,030
This seasoning's gonna be good.

298
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:56,810
Alright, just finished up with the meat, dude!

299
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,600
And now it's time to move on to the tortillas.

300
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,767
- Fleet, okay, so next up I got some fresh cheese here.

301
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,010
You see how this kind of wiggles?

302
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:02,950
That's exactly what you're looking for.

303
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,780
When you slap it, you want a slap back.

304
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,410
Here we go, just gonna pop the cheese down like this.

305
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:07,620
Here we go, block of cheese is down.

306
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,770
So next step, I'm gonna place my other wrap right over here.

307
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:10,920
My last one goes here at the back,

308
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,750
and I must admit although I am confident,

309
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,130
I am not 100% sure this is actually gonna work.

310
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:16,480
So here we go, gonna steam it up first.

311
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,313
- [Devan] I don't know if that's

312
00:08:17,313 --> 00:08:18,189
the best way to do it, Collin.

313
00:08:18,189 --> 00:08:19,022
- [Collin] And then we're just gonna see,

314
00:08:19,022 --> 00:08:19,855
let's get them all on the same one,

315
00:08:19,855 --> 00:08:20,688
and then just press it in.

316
00:08:20,688 --> 00:08:22,811
- [Devan] Yeah, uh huh, uh huh, yeah.

317
00:08:22,811 --> 00:08:23,800
- [Collin] Get a little bit of steam.

318
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,830
It left a mark.

319
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,307
- [Devan] If that's what you were going for, you did it.

320
00:08:26,307 --> 00:08:28,233
Now I'm binding the tortillas together,

321
00:08:28,233 --> 00:08:29,943
very much unlike that.

322
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:32,060
- Alright the next step now that the juice is out,

323
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:35,567
is to add all my meat, so here we go, three, two, one, oh!

324
00:08:37,089 --> 00:08:39,590
- [Devan] You burned it so bad!

325
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:40,570
- [Collin] I didn't burn.

326
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:42,257
- [Devan] How are you gonna win if you burned it?

327
00:08:42,257 --> 00:08:43,970
- That is crisp.

328
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,230
Next up we gotta add in the veggies

329
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,040
to my Crunchwrap Supreme, so first up is lettuce,

330
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,920
'cause lettuce is super crunchy, so here we go.

331
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,931
- Whoa!

332
00:08:49,931 --> 00:08:52,100
- [Collin] There we go, this is art right here.

333
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,170
Here we go, this is the painter move right here, just gonna.

334
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:55,770
- Yeah, speaking from experience,

335
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,500
I have definitely done that before.

336
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,550
Next up it's time to assemble my Crunchwrap.

337
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,130
That is how much meat you need.

338
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:03,010
- [Collin] Devan, that is not enough meat, bro.

339
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,180
You did not prepare enough.

340
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,013
- [Devan] Wait, what?

341
00:09:05,013 --> 00:09:05,846
- [Collin] Next up, we got the tomato.

342
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:06,720
So here we go, three, two, one.

343
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,590
- This is all over the great space.

344
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,770
- Here we go, tomato number two.

345
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:11,660
That came shooting at me.

346
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:15,055
- [Devan] Next up I add this cheese here that I melted down.

347
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,700
- [Collin] It's gonna be so satisfying, oh yeah.

348
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,050
- [Devan] Now that I've lathered this around,

349
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:21,450
it's time to add the salsa.

350
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:22,283
- [Collin] Let's get a little of these

351
00:09:22,283 --> 00:09:23,116
extra cooked right there.

352
00:09:23,116 --> 00:09:24,573
See that's how you make some good old meat.

353
00:09:24,573 --> 00:09:26,390
I think the fire alarm is gonna go off.

354
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,800
And there goes the fire alarm.

355
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,124
Here we go, use the tostadas to

356
00:09:29,124 --> 00:09:30,240
try to get the smoke out of here.

357
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,610
Alright, let's take a quick pause and fix this up.

358
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,750
- Ah, that's loud, time to sprinkle in the vegetables.

359
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,782
- [Collin] And I got my tostadas,

360
00:09:35,782 --> 00:09:37,570
but I gotta get these things crunchy, so here we go.

361
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:40,920
There we go, just all that crunch, bro look at that.

362
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,484
Oh, the sour cream, here we go, three, two, one.

363
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:48,408
Oh, there we go, oh!

364
00:09:48,408 --> 00:09:49,280
I'm gonna be using this thing here.

365
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,810
I think this will help me get it all folded up,

366
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:52,170
so here we go, so now, just gonna lift up

367
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:54,410
and fold over like that.

368
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:56,200
Boom, it stays, come on, work with me.

369
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,120
- [Devan] Dude, mine's working!

370
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,520
- [Collin] Mine is too, man!

371
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,710
We're both winning together, Devan.

372
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:01,240
I mean I'm winning more

373
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,280
'cause mine was more unbelievable that it would work.

374
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,030
- Time to flip it, here we go, three, two, one.

375
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,750
- Oh man, I thought you were about to do it on the counter.

376
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:11,260
- Yes, yes, yes, dude, look at this.

377
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,990
- [Collin] I don't wanna steal your thunder over here man,

378
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:17,250
but I can't help it, bro, mine is just oh, look at that!

379
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,830
It's missing one authentic Crunchwrap Supreme on top.

380
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:21,860
You get to comment down below

381
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,520
whose do you think is going to taste better,

382
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,240
'cause we'll be trying them at the end of the video.

383
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,500
You challenged us to make pancakes

384
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,220
from Avengers Endgame, so let's go.

385
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,319
- [Collin] I'm making Iron Man.

386
00:10:29,319 --> 00:10:30,750
- [Devan] Alright, I'm starting with the head right now.

387
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:31,820
- [Collin] So we're gonna start off here

388
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,687
at his box head, so here we go.

389
00:10:33,687 --> 00:10:35,380
We're gonna have a lot of room for details in that hand.

390
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,800
It looks like he's doing like a little dance move.

391
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,360
- [Devan] Dude, he's got two ping pong paddles.

392
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,193
- [Collin] Yo, that's like an upgrade

393
00:10:39,193 --> 00:10:41,170
to the Iron Man suit, man, Ping Pong Man.

394
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,261
Next up we're gonna do the eyes, so here we go.

395
00:10:43,261 --> 00:10:44,940
We gotta go one line across like this.

396
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,843
He looks like he's wearing some stoner shades right now.

397
00:10:46,843 --> 00:10:48,550
- [Devan] I gotta be very detailed here.

398
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,120
- Oh, that's a skateboard bro.

399
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,953
That's not even his legs right now.

400
00:10:50,953 --> 00:10:52,010
That's a little skateboard down here.

401
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:53,210
So here we go, it's gonna do this.

402
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:55,300
- [Devan] Oh boy, I made his arm really small.

403
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,925
- So next up here, we're gonna give him the detailing

404
00:10:56,925 --> 00:10:58,870
that Devan has done on the insides, I don't know.

405
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:00,640
Just kind of like a whole bunch of different lines.

406
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,970
That's what he's doing, he's wearing a man satchel.

407
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,490
It looks more like a guitar than a bag,

408
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:06,330
so we're gonna turn it in to a guitar.

409
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,200
Here we go, Guitar Hero Iron Man.

410
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,590
- [Devan] Man, the mouth is really difficult.

411
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:10,423
- [Collin] Next up gotta give him

412
00:11:10,423 --> 00:11:12,160
the little light blasters in his palm right here.

413
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,530
- [Devan] Alright, detailing at the eyes.

414
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:14,840
Gotta add some foreshortening.

415
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,510
The arm's coming forward so much.

416
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,730
- [Collin] Wait, what is foreshortening?

417
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:18,680
- [Devan] Yeah, it's hard to explain.

418
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,600
- [Collin] See fashion is his passion, and baggy shirts

419
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,503
is absolutely what he loves to wear, so here we go.

420
00:11:22,503 --> 00:11:23,840
He's not laying on the grass.

421
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,580
This is actually his style right now.

422
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:28,610
Dude, yours is looking so crazy man.

423
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:30,170
Alright, now time to get my skater boy's mouth.

424
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:32,230
So here we go, we're gonna give him a big old mouth.

425
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:34,568
Very confused and surprised at the same time right now.

426
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:36,030
- He's like, huh, what'd you say?

427
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,810
Alright, adding the reactor in the center.

428
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:38,870
I think that's the reactor, right?

429
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:39,703
- [Collin] I dunno.

430
00:11:39,703 --> 00:11:42,340
- [Devan] I think I wanna add some gray accents under here.

431
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,560
- [Collin] The thing is this isn't Iron Man.

432
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,081
This is Aluminum Foil Boi.

433
00:11:45,081 --> 00:11:46,880
You gotta hit it with that every single time.

434
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,940
He comes down the boardwalk.

435
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,260
He's like, wow, Aluminum Foil Boi.

436
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:52,250
On his hand we're gonna give him a cool spider tattoo

437
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,560
that he definitely doesn't regret.

438
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,190
Of course we gotta give him a purple guitar,

439
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,260
because that's really gonna bring

440
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,630
this whole outfit together for him.

441
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,010
I'm gonna try to add some muscles right now,

442
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,080
because he's currently trying out the Hulk Bulk workout,

443
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,910
which is he saw it on P-90-Flex.

444
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,660
Alright now time to fully fill my guy in.

445
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,290
So here we go, gonna fill in his hands.

446
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:09,070
Next up we got the iron body, the suit right here.

447
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:11,740
- Wait, he's red, oh right, he's wearing a suit.

448
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,990
- [Collin] We don't actually know if it's a suit

449
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,130
or if he's actually sunburned.

450
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:15,880
We'll find out at some point, we'll have to ask him.

451
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,970
- [Devan] Carefully, carefully, carefully, and done.

452
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:18,900
- I think this may literally be

453
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,730
the best pancake you have ever made.

454
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:22,650
Initially the green was supposed to be a giant baggy shirt,

455
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:23,780
but now it looks like he's kinda like

456
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:26,210
tanning on a beach towel with a guitar across his chest.

457
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:27,170
- [Devan] Mine's all filled in,

458
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:28,003
and now it's time to let it roast.

459
00:12:28,003 --> 00:12:30,480
- Here we go, the flip, time to see how mine turned out.

460
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,480
- [Both] Three, two, one, oh, whoa!

461
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,300
- [Collin] He got super crusty bro.

462
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,843
- Alright here we go, three, two, one.

463
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:40,676
- Five second subscribe challenge.

464
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,420
We wanna see if you can subscribe to this channel

465
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,080
and turn on the channel post notifications

466
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,560
in five seconds, you ready, here we go.

467
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:50,560
- Five, four, three, two, one, done!

468
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,780
- If you can do that, comment down below,

469
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,120
Keyper Squad right now.

470
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,960
- Ready, set, go.

471
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,460
- [Collin] Oh, don't break it.

472
00:12:59,677 --> 00:13:02,010
Oh my gosh bro, what?

473
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:04,010
That looks so crazy bro.

474
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:05,910
You get to comment down below who won this round,

475
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,560
and we'll be eating them at the end of the video.

476
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,660
You challenged us to make a

477
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:11,060
giant piece of sushi, so let's go.

478
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,180
- [Devan] First up, I'm adding rice to my sushi roll.

479
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,100
- And first up, I'm gonna be pre-seasoning my rice

480
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,500
with a whole bunch of soy sauce.

481
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,650
See the mistake most people make,

482
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:19,260
they don't add soy sauce at the beginning,

483
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,914
and then the customer has to dunk their sushi in soy sauce.

484
00:13:21,914 --> 00:13:23,654
Oh, there we go, almost all in there.

485
00:13:23,654 --> 00:13:25,250
- [Devan] Collin, control yourself.

486
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,596
- I gotta cream my rice right here,

487
00:13:26,596 --> 00:13:28,170
so we got the soy sauce. - That's on the table.

488
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:30,060
- It is very heavy, now I gotta get the hands in.

489
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,460
Ah, it like burned for a split second.

490
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,310
- [Devan] And I'm putting my rice on my nori sheet.

491
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:35,427
- Alright here we go,

492
00:13:35,427 --> 00:13:36,933
just gonna add the rice here, so here we go.

493
00:13:37,968 --> 00:13:39,740
There we go, that's number one.

494
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:42,440
I call this de-graining the rice, it's a terrible name.

495
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,930
- [Devan] Alright well while you're making your soup,

496
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:45,870
I'm gonna be adding my next ingredient.

497
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:48,290
- It's sushi bro, how could this be soup,

498
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:50,541
if I don't even use the bowl, I can't grip it.

499
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:52,650
And ta da, there we go bro.

500
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:54,670
Next up to make my sushi even more authentic,

501
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:55,777
I have other littler pieces of sushi.

502
00:13:55,777 --> 00:13:58,110
I'm gonna go from this side, like that.

503
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:00,270
And this side over here.

504
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,560
- [Devan] Next up I'm dicing my pepper.

505
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,050
- But first bro, can you hold that up really quick?

506
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,640
No Devan, the board, so hold it up facing me.

507
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,730
Now this is how you get the perfect texture wasabi.

508
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:11,510
Three, two, one, oh, see look at it man!

509
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,330
- Did you ever think about that might miss?

510
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:15,600
- Devan, I'm a wasabi throwing champion.

511
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,120
Boom, there we go, wasabi is in.

512
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,290
Oh yeah, look how the wasabi just mixes right in.

513
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:21,390
You gotta really cultivate it, just speak to the sushi.

514
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,510
You know like, you're beautiful.

515
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,870
You're everything you should be and more.

516
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:27,098
Next up, we got some cucumbers, so ah!

517
00:14:27,098 --> 00:14:29,150
- You're so strong Collin.

518
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:31,840
To be able to break a cucumber is just incredible.

519
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,880
- Wait are you being sarcastic?

520
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,713
- Maybe.

521
00:14:33,713 --> 00:14:35,190
- [Collin] Devan, is there anything my sushi is missing?

522
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,100
- A plan.

523
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,320
- No, not at all Devan.

524
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,880
Some imitation crab meat, 'cause nothing says sushi

525
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,150
more than this rubber looking stuff.

526
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,560
So here we go, just gonna mash it all up.

527
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,550
- [Devan] Next up I'm chopping up all my vegetables

528
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,960
and putting them on my nori sheet.

529
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,150
- [Collin] I got the majority of the ingredients.

530
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:50,040
The one thing it's missing is the main ingredient of sushi

531
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,860
besides rice, which is fish.

532
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,693
- I got my fish.

533
00:14:52,693 --> 00:14:53,720
- And I got my fish.

534
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,953
- Whoa, what are you doing with that?

535
00:14:54,953 --> 00:14:57,870
- This is my giant fish for my giant sushi, Devan.

536
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,334
- You're not gonna be able to use that.

537
00:14:59,334 --> 00:15:01,320
- What are you talking about bro, I'm a sushi master bro.

538
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,190
- [Devan] You haven't even made your sushi yet.

539
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:04,998
- I'm part way there, and I just gotta add the fish in.

540
00:15:04,998 --> 00:15:07,120
- Oh man!

541
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,734
- You know what, maybe I don't know how to handle a fish.

542
00:15:08,734 --> 00:15:09,770
I should probably go put this back.

543
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:11,360
So next up I gotta construct the roll,

544
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,410
and when you're constructing the roll,

545
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:14,000
do not get your hands in the sushi.

546
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,010
That's proper sushi etiquette.

547
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,520
So you're gonna borrow your brother's spoon,

548
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,120
just gonna, here you go, lift up a little scoop like this.

549
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,160
- [Devan] Why your brother's specifically?

550
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:19,993
- [Collin] Because this is what you gotta do.

551
00:15:19,993 --> 00:15:22,210
Three, two, one, boom, like that, here we go.

552
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:23,690
- [Devan] Next up I'm gonna roll my salmon.

553
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,060
- I gotta say Devan, all things considered,

554
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,220
yours is looking pretty similar to mine right now.

555
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,450
So now it's time to get in there with the hands,

556
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:30,220
'cause I got kind of bored with not using my hands.

557
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,053
Get that out of here, so here we go,

558
00:15:31,053 --> 00:15:33,010
I got a whole bunch of salmon, gonna pick a spot.

559
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:34,080
Just kind of lay the salmon down

560
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:34,913
on the inside like this.

561
00:15:34,913 --> 00:15:36,733
- [Devan] You know you could roll it too, right?

562
00:15:36,733 --> 00:15:39,060
- Well you never prematurely roll your sushi,

563
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,200
otherwise you lose.

564
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,290
- [Devan] Alright the last thing for me

565
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:42,470
is just to add the ginger.

566
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,030
- Time to roll this thing up, so here we go.

567
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,240
So this is where all the expertise,

568
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,480
all the years of focusing, of training comes in to it.

569
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,000
'Cause see, here we go, gonna roll it like this.

570
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,970
Boom, Devan, you're not paying attention,

571
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:52,840
but things magnificently are happening here.

572
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,033
I did it, wow, look at it!

573
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,380
- If only all sushi chefs

574
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,207
got as excited about their sushi as you do.

575
00:16:00,207 --> 00:16:02,010
- They'd probably have no one in the restaurant

576
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:03,020
'cause they would be freaked out.

577
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,550
So next up, you're gonna be rolling yours.

578
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,700
We're gonna see who actually created the better one.

579
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,790
That is definitely the largest piece of sushi

580
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,650
I have ever seen, and here's the big reveal.

581
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:12,893
- Ready, set, go, ta da!

582
00:16:12,893 --> 00:16:15,740
- That is like 100 sushi rolls in one.

583
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,770
You get to comment down below

584
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:19,708
whose sushi roll do you think is gonna taste better.

585
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:20,541
We got all the giant foods,

586
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:21,483
and now it's time to see how they taste.

587
00:16:21,483 --> 00:16:22,316
Alright so what do you think is a

588
00:16:22,316 --> 00:16:23,540
strategy of how we're gonna eat this?

589
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,820
This is heavy. - [Devan] Dude I don't know.

590
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,160
I can actually kind of pick mine up.

591
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,804
- [Collin] Bro you can pick it all up.

592
00:16:27,804 --> 00:16:28,765
- I think I got it.

593
00:16:28,765 --> 00:16:29,930
I got it. - Oh snap!

594
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:31,470
- But the only problem is if I bite this,

595
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:32,470
I just get tortilla dude.

596
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,140
So I think I should probably cut this open.

597
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,113
- Mine is not structurally sound enough

598
00:16:35,113 --> 00:16:36,353
to be able to remove it from this.

599
00:16:36,353 --> 00:16:38,230
We also got the mini Crunchwrap Supreme,

600
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,840
so I might get a little piece of that on top right now.

601
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,900
- [Devan] And plus it's gonna look super cool on the inside.

602
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:42,933
- Do not try this at home, here we go.

603
00:16:42,933 --> 00:16:44,119
Just gonna slice it off 'cause if I can just

604
00:16:44,119 --> 00:16:45,870
score it down the middle here.

605
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,870
Oh man, mine goes like butter throughout.

606
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,320
I think it's 'cause of all the melting I did.

607
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,970
- [Devan] Mine's really toasted dude.

608
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:52,578
- [Collin] Yeah mine's not as crunchy as what I thought.

609
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:53,900
It's got a lot more soggy.

610
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:57,510
This is such a monstrous dish man, it is just massive.

611
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:58,343
- [Devan] This is looking good.

612
00:16:58,343 --> 00:16:59,670
- [Collin] Yeah yours is looking a lot better than mine man.

613
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:04,647
Oh snap, look at this bro, this is so good!

614
00:17:04,647 --> 00:17:06,520
- [Devan] Oh, oh, look at mine!

615
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,823
It's creamy and melted, what's happening?

616
00:17:08,823 --> 00:17:12,700
- Put it back, you gotta grab another one bro, yeah!

617
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,387
You know what, your piece is a little bit bigger than mine.

618
00:17:14,387 --> 00:17:15,540
I'm feeling a little bit insecure right now,

619
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,600
so I'm gonna place my piece right over here to the side.

620
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,697
I'm gonna go for a large piece right now.

621
00:17:18,697 --> 00:17:20,940
I'm gonna go for this piece right here.

622
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:25,140
Oh snap bro, look at mine!

623
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,320
- [Devan] Whoa dude!

624
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,760
- It's all creamy and melty.

625
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,593
- Yeah.

626
00:17:28,593 --> 00:17:29,550
- The moment you've all been waiting for.

627
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:30,863
Time to find out what this tastes like.

628
00:17:30,863 --> 00:17:33,930
- Alright here we go, three, two, one.

629
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:36,570
- Oh man, oh I can hear the crunch bro.

630
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:38,150
It's really crunchy, is it good?

631
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:41,483
You legit made an actual Crunchwrap Supreme bro.

632
00:17:41,483 --> 00:17:42,817
Well now it's time to find out how mine tastes,

633
00:17:42,817 --> 00:17:44,640
and I gotta say bro, I am an innovator.

634
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,510
This is a Crunchwrap Supreme taken to the next level.

635
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:49,270
There's even a real Crunchwrap Supreme on the front of it.

636
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,300
So here we go, you ready?

637
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,243
- Ready, set, go.

638
00:17:53,242 --> 00:17:55,643
- [Devan] Oh, how is it?

639
00:17:55,643 --> 00:17:57,530
- I am an innovator.

640
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,960
- Is it really good, is it really cheesy though?

641
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,810
- That was the best thing ever,

642
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:02,780
and we're on to the next one.

643
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:05,370
We've got the giant sushi but these chopsticks won't work,

644
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:08,100
so yeet, we need to bring out the giant chopsticks.

645
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,257
Yeah one here like this, one here like this.

646
00:18:09,257 --> 00:18:10,587
And Devan, I'll go first on mine.

647
00:18:10,587 --> 00:18:11,990
You know what, before I grab mine,

648
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,530
I need to add some seasoning to it.

649
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,190
Luckily we got a giant plate over here.

650
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,023
Devan can you please hold it up?

651
00:18:16,023 --> 00:18:19,290
First we're gonna add some soy sauce to it.

652
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:20,140
Devan, you gotta hold it,

653
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,300
otherwise if you spill it- - [Devan] I am.

654
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,670
- If you spill it, it gets everywhere.

655
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:23,503
- I got you dude.

656
00:18:23,503 --> 00:18:24,620
- So next up here, I've got some,

657
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:27,900
we got some wasabi, so I'm gonna, there we go, perfect.

658
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,150
We're gonna add the wasabi in.

659
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,660
- Can you hurry up dude, my arm's getting tired.

660
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,493
- Next up we'll use the little chopsticks,

661
00:18:32,493 --> 00:18:33,970
just kind of mix it all around in here.

662
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:34,803
- [Devan] Is that necessary?

663
00:18:34,803 --> 00:18:35,870
- [Collin] It's absolutely necessary, Devan.

664
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:37,460
Otherwise it won't be mixed properly, you know what I mean?

665
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,560
Now I got the giant chopsticks.

666
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,320
Thank you Devan for holding that, oh, I'm sorry!

667
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,990
Here we go, one on either side just kind of like this.

668
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:45,250
So here we go, oh I almost hit Houdini, sorry Houdini.

669
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,420
So I get a little pinch like this, oh it's gonna break it.

670
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,410
You know what, we're gonna have to put

671
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:49,840
these giant chopsticks off to the side,

672
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,960
and we're gonna have to forget about those.

673
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,530
It's definitely gotten soggier since I left it.

674
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:55,150
So here we go, oh, man!

675
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:56,786
I made that noise, not the sushi, so here we go.

676
00:18:56,786 --> 00:18:57,786
You have to get in and flip it up.

677
00:18:57,786 --> 00:18:59,430
Here we go, three, two, one, and flip up.

678
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:02,710
Oh look at that bro, dripping, glistening with the juice.

679
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:04,197
- Didn't you already put soy sauce on it?

680
00:19:04,197 --> 00:19:05,800
- You gotta always season, Devan.

681
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,210
- But you said you pre-seasoned it.

682
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:09,100
- You gotta pre-season and post-season, Devan.

683
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,480
You gotta get all seasons in here,

684
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,630
otherwise you're gonna get out of shape.

685
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:13,539
I think I was talking about sports.

686
00:19:13,539 --> 00:19:14,710
Luckily I've infused the rice so whenever I take a bite,

687
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:16,420
I'm getting all the flavors at once.

688
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,710
That's a lot of soy sauce.

689
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:19,880
Before you dunk yours, I'm gonna go for a bite of mine.

690
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,050
Here we go, three, two-

691
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:21,883
- Oh, wait.

692
00:19:21,883 --> 00:19:23,485
- What, what?

693
00:19:23,485 --> 00:19:24,510
- Good luck.

694
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:25,430
- Alright, thanks.

695
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,263
- You're welcome.

696
00:19:26,263 --> 00:19:27,096
- Can I eat it?

697
00:19:27,096 --> 00:19:28,056
- Yeah.

698
00:19:28,056 --> 00:19:29,770
- Okay, three, two, one.

699
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:34,630
- [Devan] Oh, what, what, what?

700
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:36,430
I thought you pre-sauced it, post-sauced it.

701
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:37,960
It was supposed to be great.

702
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,953
- But it's like the-

703
00:19:39,953 --> 00:19:41,720
- It's like the what dude?

704
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:45,390
- Wow, it's so much wasabi man, and like the soy sauce.

705
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:47,560
It's really like blasting my taste buds.

706
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,643
- Time for mine, here we go.

707
00:19:48,643 --> 00:19:51,704
- Caution you Devan, go light on the soy sauce.

708
00:19:51,704 --> 00:19:54,590
Oh man that's perfect, dip it in the soy sauce.

709
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:55,672
- I need to leave it in there.

710
00:19:55,672 --> 00:19:57,120
Alright, here we go.

711
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,580
- How heavy would you say that thing is?

712
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,320
- I don't know, it's gotta be like 20 pounds.

713
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,153
- And I'm really wondering,

714
00:20:01,153 --> 00:20:02,530
how are you gonna be able to take a bite of this thing?

715
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:03,580
I'm really confused right now.

716
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:06,880
- I don't know, we'll figure it out, ready, set, go.

717
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,070
- [Collin] And then we're on to the next one.

718
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,347
- [Devan] We've got the giant Wendy's chicken nugget,

719
00:20:09,347 --> 00:20:10,860
and it's time to see how it tastes.

720
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:11,693
- I gotta say bro,

721
00:20:11,693 --> 00:20:13,720
this would be the craziest Lunchables pack ever.

722
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,820
The issue is I'm gonna have to add my squeet sauce to it.

723
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:21,464
Three, two, one, oh, the squeet sauce.

724
00:20:21,464 --> 00:20:24,350
Oh man, it's just so many smells

725
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,947
and so many ingredients mixed together, so here we go.

726
00:20:25,947 --> 00:20:27,927
I'm gonna cut it open, and do not try this at home.

727
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:29,960
I just gotta break it open, let it just-

728
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,840
- Oh, it's like soggy dough.

729
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,050
- So let's just get a,

730
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:35,690
let's get a spoonful here, there we go.

731
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:37,380
And then of course, gotta dip it in my squeet sauce.

732
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,220
So here we go, just dip, dip, dip in the squeet sauce,

733
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:42,670
and oh my goodness, oh boy, here we go, three, no.

734
00:20:43,773 --> 00:20:44,990
- Just go dude.

735
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:45,823
- Three, two, one.

736
00:20:45,823 --> 00:20:47,653
- [Devan] Get it over with man.

737
00:20:47,653 --> 00:20:50,453
Oh, is it spicy, is it really hot?

738
00:20:52,076 --> 00:20:53,180
- I think I made a huge mistake.

739
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:56,437
No one should ever experience squeets man, those were tack.

740
00:20:56,437 --> 00:20:58,193
Let's hope yours tastes a little bit better, man.

741
00:20:58,193 --> 00:21:01,980
- I think it will, oh this dip is gonna look so cool dude.

742
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,043
- Oh snap.

743
00:21:04,043 --> 00:21:06,130
- Yes, three, two, one.

744
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:08,920
- If you wanna win a 15 minute video call with Devan and I,

745
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,570
text the word giant to 81800 right now.

746
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,930
So pause the video, text the word giant to 81800.

747
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:15,390
You'll automatically be entered in to win.

748
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:16,830
And let's see how this thing tastes bro.

749
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:17,953
- Ready, set, go.

750
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,030
- Oh my gosh!

751
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,657
We've got our giant slice of Pizza Hut pizza,

752
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,693
and it's time to see how it tastes, it is massive bro.

753
00:21:25,693 --> 00:21:28,010
Look at this, this is a normal pizza slice,

754
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:30,810
compared to yours man, what, it's like 10 of them.

755
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:32,900
Like even two pizza slices back to back

756
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,040
is not even your full slice man.

757
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,986
Are you gonna go in on the side, the front?

758
00:21:36,986 --> 00:21:37,819
I mean what are you thinking?

759
00:21:37,819 --> 00:21:39,180
- [Devan] I don't know, maybe I'll fold it in half.

760
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:41,240
- How are you even gonna be able to take a bite of that bro?

761
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,753
- I don't know man, but you should try yours first.

762
00:21:42,753 --> 00:21:43,740
- I gotta say, mine turned out

763
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,785
a lot better than I thought it would.

764
00:21:44,785 --> 00:21:46,610
I'm just gonna get a hand under here, oh man.

765
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:48,760
It's a lot of excess liquid and juices, I gotta say.

766
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,600
- Oh yeah, it's all the pineapple juice.

767
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,090
- Yeah, it's not quite cooked all the way through.

768
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:53,690
At the bottom I can kind of feel it right now.

769
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:56,025
Let me see if I just, oh boy yeah, look at that bro.

770
00:21:56,025 --> 00:21:58,033
- [Devan] That's what I told you dude.

771
00:21:58,033 --> 00:21:58,866
- I'm just gonna pick up a chunk here,

772
00:21:58,866 --> 00:22:00,193
and just kinda go underneath like this,

773
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:02,180
and then just scoop and grab.

774
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,190
- [Devan] Look at the inside.

775
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:05,930
Look at the inside, look at that.

776
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:07,544
- [Collin] Wait what, oh man yeah,

777
00:22:07,544 --> 00:22:09,030
that did not cook all the way through at all.

778
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:12,280
So let's, what is this, it's like my whack looking crust.

779
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,890
- What, your whack, I thought it was great?

780
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:16,030
- Devan it didn't go according to plan.

781
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:16,863
- Oh really?

782
00:22:16,863 --> 00:22:17,730
- I'm kinda desecrating it right now.

783
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:18,590
I'll go for this one here.

784
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,560
Alright so we got a bit of the crust here,

785
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,687
so gonna place it on the top

786
00:22:20,687 --> 00:22:22,097
like there's a little bit of a topping for my crust.

787
00:22:22,097 --> 00:22:26,230
Let's hope my unique sauce tastes good, three, two, one.

788
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:28,210
- [Devan] I mean to be honest it should taste good.

789
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:29,950
It's got all the right ingredients.

790
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:30,783
- Whoa.

791
00:22:30,783 --> 00:22:31,750
- What, is it really good?

792
00:22:32,921 --> 00:22:34,260
What, what happened?

793
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,810
I knew adding the pineapple,

794
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:38,390
the broccoli, and the salt was a terrible idea.

795
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,040
- That's what it was is the pineapple juice,

796
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,650
combined with the uncooked batter

797
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:42,940
and like a weird burnt-ness.

798
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:45,640
It was good for like four seconds, and then it got real bad.

799
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,280
- Alright I hope mine tastes better, I think it will.

800
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,348
- Yeah, me too, wait a minute, look at the bottom of it bro.

801
00:22:51,348 --> 00:22:52,250
- What, it's a little burnt.

802
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:53,662
- Show them the bottom of it dude.

803
00:22:53,662 --> 00:22:54,723
- It's not a problem. - [Collin] Stop dude.

804
00:22:54,723 --> 00:22:55,960
- [Devan] It's just a little burnt.

805
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,240
- You might chip a tooth on that.

806
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,940
It looks like a paved road.

807
00:22:58,940 --> 00:22:59,773
Where are you gonna bite it though?

808
00:22:59,773 --> 00:23:01,150
That's where I'm really curious.

809
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:02,227
- You know what I think you're supposed to eat it like this.

810
00:23:02,227 --> 00:23:04,530
I feel like that side's just too much crust.

811
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:05,970
I think I should just bite the middle.

812
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:08,020
What am I supposed to do, fold it into a taco or something?

813
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,890
- Careful with the end, that almost popped me in the face.

814
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,180
But right now, you wanna see how it tastes?

815
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,689
- I'm ready dude, here we go.

816
00:23:12,689 --> 00:23:14,630
Alright here we go, three, two, one.

817
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:16,240

It's only $4.99 a month, and Devan,

825
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,340
let's see how this tastes man.

826
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,743
- Ready, set, go.

827
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,293
- Are you okay?

828
00:23:35,293 --> 00:23:39,380
- I can't bite it, it's so brittle.

829
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,640
I'm gonna have to break it in half.

830
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,907
- What, you're gonna wreck your pizza?

831
00:23:42,907 --> 00:23:43,740
- [Devan] And the best part,

832
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:46,420
we made all these foods in under 24 hours.

833
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,650
Alright the piece is broken off,

834
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:49,170
and now I can actually take a bite.

835
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:53,810
Three, two, one, oh, oh my goodness.

836
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:56,553
- It sounded like the perfect amount of crispiness.

837
00:23:56,553 --> 00:23:57,386
- It's so good dude.

838
00:23:57,386 --> 00:23:58,980
- And I'm guessing 'cause it's a giant piece of pizza,

839
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,940
the flavor's even bigger, right?

840
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,773
- Weirdly, yeah.

841
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:02,610
- And don't worry, Devan and I

842
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:04,390
will not be eating all this food by ourself.

843
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:06,140
We're gonna be sharing with our friends and family.

844
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,930
Comment down below what is your favorite food

845
