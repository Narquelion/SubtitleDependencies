1
00:00:00,124 --> 00:00:01,248
- [Devin] Dry ice smash!

2
00:00:01,248 --> 00:00:02,650
- [Collins] Wait, what? Holy cow, dude!

3
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:03,548
- [Devin] Look at that!

4
00:00:03,548 --> 00:00:04,468
- [Collins] Holy cow!

5
00:00:04,468 --> 00:00:05,700
- You challenged us to make

6
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,061
three insane superhero gadgets

7
00:00:07,061 --> 00:00:07,894
out of food.

8
00:00:07,894 --> 00:00:08,874
We're making an Infinity Gauntlet,

9
00:00:08,874 --> 00:00:09,923
Captain America's shield,

10
00:00:09,923 --> 00:00:10,822
and the Green Goblin gadget

11
00:00:10,822 --> 00:00:12,055
we're literally throwing off of

12
00:00:12,055 --> 00:00:13,425
our balcony, so let's go!

13
00:00:13,425 --> 00:00:14,802
- [Devin] So this is going to be

14
00:00:14,802 --> 00:00:15,840
the filing for my gadget!

15
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:16,828
- [Collins] Time to make some spun honey!

16
00:00:16,828 --> 00:00:17,869
I've got some green food coloring

17
00:00:17,869 --> 00:00:18,802
in honey right now.

18
00:00:18,802 --> 00:00:19,887
Going to turn on the contraption over here,

19
00:00:19,887 --> 00:00:21,197
do not try this at home!

20
00:00:21,197 --> 00:00:22,293
For our first edible art piece,

21
00:00:22,293 --> 00:00:24,065
we're making a Green Goblin Gadget from Spider-Man.

22
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:24,898
Three

23
00:00:24,898 --> 00:00:25,731
- [Both] Two

24
00:00:25,731 --> 00:00:26,564
One!

25
00:00:26,564 --> 00:00:27,397
- [Devin] Should I be, like,

26
00:00:27,397 --> 00:00:28,230
stepping back at all?

27
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,063
- [Collins] Dude!

28
00:00:29,063 --> 00:00:29,896
- [Devin] Yo!

29
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:30,729
- [Both] Whoa! Oh!

30
00:00:30,729 --> 00:00:31,658
- [Collins] That is so cool, man!

31
00:00:31,658 --> 00:00:32,974
- [Devin] That is amazing!

32
00:00:32,974 --> 00:00:34,361
- [Collins] Holy cow!

33
00:00:34,361 --> 00:00:36,279
- [Collins] This is like Spider-Man's webs right here!

34
00:00:36,279 --> 00:00:37,421
Turn off the machine, and now it's time

35
00:00:37,421 --> 00:00:38,732
for me to get in there with my hands and

36
00:00:38,732 --> 00:00:40,646
collect all the different spun honey right now.

37
00:00:40,646 --> 00:00:41,479
What is that?

38
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:42,463
[Devin] I got some heavy cream here.

39
00:00:42,463 --> 00:00:43,624
I'm going to put into this bowl.

40
00:00:43,624 --> 00:00:44,585
- [Collins] Here we go.

41
00:00:44,585 --> 00:00:45,740
I'm going to reach in, let's see

42
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:46,659
how it feels! Oh, my G--owww!

43
00:00:46,659 --> 00:00:47,709
It feels like spider webs!

44
00:00:47,709 --> 00:00:49,447
Oh, I don't like it!

45
00:00:49,447 --> 00:00:50,280
I mean, look at it!

46
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,534
It looks like spider webs!

47
00:00:51,534 --> 00:00:52,367
- [Devin] I know!

48
00:00:52,367 --> 00:00:53,767
- [Collins] Oh, now, man, it's so crazy! Okay!

49
00:00:53,767 --> 00:00:54,887
- [Devin] Okay, now I'm adding some food coloring.

50
00:00:54,887 --> 00:00:57,018
- [Collins] Boom! A bushel of spun honey

51
00:00:57,018 --> 00:00:57,851
right here, man!

52
00:00:57,851 --> 00:00:59,576
- [Devin] Now it's time to add the dry ice

53
00:00:59,576 --> 00:01:00,829
into this mixture here.

54
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:01,740
- [Collins] Wait, what?

55
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:02,816
Wait wait wait wait wait wait wait--

56
00:01:02,816 --> 00:01:04,063
- [Devin] Three, two, one

57
00:01:04,063 --> 00:01:05,310
- [Both] Oh!

58
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,482
- [Collins] Look at it bubble, dude!

59
00:01:06,482 --> 00:01:07,315
- [Devin] Yes!

60
00:01:07,315 --> 00:01:08,148
- [Collins] Holy cow?

61
00:01:08,148 --> 00:01:08,981
- [Devin] This is amazing!

62
00:01:08,981 --> 00:01:09,814
This is going to be

63
00:01:09,814 --> 00:01:10,647
the inside of my gadget!

64
00:01:10,647 --> 00:01:11,881
- [Collins] The inside is going to be bubbling?

65
00:01:11,881 --> 00:01:13,229
- [Devin] Yeah, it actually activates it and

66
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:14,129
it bubble like this.

67
00:01:14,129 --> 00:01:15,049
- [Collins] Now I'm making the first

68
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:16,076
element of my Tesseract.

69
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:16,909
So, as you do that,

70
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:17,784
I've got my ice over here!

71
00:01:17,784 --> 00:01:18,617
Woo-hoo! Whoa!

72
00:01:18,617 --> 00:01:19,450
That was kind of insane.

73
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:20,283
All right.

74
00:01:20,283 --> 00:01:21,116
I meant to grab it in a normal fashion,

75
00:01:21,116 --> 00:01:21,949
- [Devin] Uh huh.

76
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:22,782
- [Collins] It didn't go that way.

77
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:23,859
So here we go. We've got a whole bunch

78
00:01:23,859 --> 00:01:24,692
of ice, here, and there's a cool way

79
00:01:24,692 --> 00:01:25,525
we can pop off the top, Devin.

80
00:01:25,525 --> 00:01:26,358
We're going to use a plunger, here,

81
00:01:26,358 --> 00:01:27,191
and check this out! Here we go, watch!

82
00:01:27,191 --> 00:01:28,038
We go one, two, three

83
00:01:28,038 --> 00:01:29,203
- [Devin] Oh, dear! Oh, dear!

84
00:01:29,203 --> 00:01:30,733
That top's going to blow!

85
00:01:30,733 --> 00:01:31,941
- [Collins] It's a sanitized plunger,

86
00:01:31,941 --> 00:01:32,774
don't you worry!

87
00:01:32,774 --> 00:01:33,944
Instead of just dumping it in,

88
00:01:33,944 --> 00:01:35,477
that'd be too easy, instead we're going to go like this.

89
00:01:35,477 --> 00:01:37,618
A fa la A fa la la la

90
00:01:37,618 --> 00:01:39,572
- [Devin] You're going to break this! What are you doing?

91
00:01:39,572 --> 00:01:41,117
- [Collins] It's a slight dance, Devin!

92
00:01:41,117 --> 00:01:42,033
- [Devin] Put it in like that.

93
00:01:42,033 --> 00:01:42,981
- [Collins] All right, we'll get a

94
00:01:42,981 --> 00:01:44,271
behind the shoulder yeet yeet!

95
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:45,126
- [Devin] Completely missed. - [Collins] Did I get any in?

96
00:01:45,126 --> 00:01:46,067
- [Devin] Not even one.

97
00:01:46,067 --> 00:01:47,016
- [Collins] I completely missed. All right, here we go.

98
00:01:47,016 --> 00:01:49,020
We'll dump it all in. Bam! Ice bucket number one is in.

99
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:49,853
- [Devin] All right!

100
00:01:49,853 --> 00:01:50,686
Look at this!

101
00:01:50,686 --> 00:01:51,519
- [Collins] Holy cow!

102
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:52,352
- [Devin] It's working!

103
00:01:52,352 --> 00:01:53,301
- [Collins] When did that happen, man?

104
00:01:53,301 --> 00:01:54,134
- [Devin] Just now!

105
00:01:54,134 --> 00:01:55,317
As you were dumping all that in there!

106
00:01:55,317 --> 00:01:57,172
All right, my D.I.Y. frozen treat is done,

107
00:01:57,172 --> 00:01:58,781
and now it's time to slice off the top of

108
00:01:58,781 --> 00:02:00,663
my pumpkin in a very cool way!

109
00:02:00,663 --> 00:02:02,120
- [Collins] (karate sound) Not like that.

110
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,984
- [Devin] Even cooler than that.

111
00:02:02,984 --> 00:02:04,496
I've got my power washer here,

112
00:02:04,496 --> 00:02:05,377
I've got the pumpkin secure.

113
00:02:05,377 --> 00:02:06,210
And now, it's time to slice off the top!

114
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,691
- [Collins] Oh, I almost tripped on my way in!

115
00:02:07,691 --> 00:02:08,649
But I am here right now!

116
00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:09,672
- [Devin] Yeah, and tarp the floors.

117
00:02:09,672 --> 00:02:10,905
- [Collins] So, the water power from this

118
00:02:10,905 --> 00:02:11,854
is going to be able to slice off

119
00:02:11,854 --> 00:02:12,687
the top of the pumpkin.

120
00:02:12,687 --> 00:02:13,520
- [Devin] Exactly.

121
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,353
- [Collins] Click over here to vote

122
00:02:14,353 --> 00:02:15,186
if you think water will be able to slice

123
00:02:15,186 --> 00:02:16,110
off the top the pumpkin.

124
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:16,943
- [Devin] I think it will.

125
00:02:16,943 --> 00:02:17,786
- [Collins] I don't think so, man.

126
00:02:17,786 --> 00:02:18,619
It's water, bro!

127
00:02:18,619 --> 00:02:19,452
- [Devin] All right, here we go!

128
00:02:19,452 --> 00:02:24,319
Three, two, one. No! It's mostly flying back at me!

129
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,152
Oh, yes!

130
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,363
It's gotten more powerful!

131
00:02:26,363 --> 00:02:27,196
Oh!

132
00:02:27,196 --> 00:02:28,378
It's kind of working!

133
00:02:28,378 --> 00:02:31,211
I think this is going to take a while!

134
00:02:31,211 --> 00:02:32,506
Oh, yes!

135
00:02:32,506 --> 00:02:33,339
It worked!

136
00:02:33,339 --> 00:02:34,172
All right!

137
00:02:34,172 --> 00:02:35,601
Now I just have to clean this thing out!

138
00:02:35,601 --> 00:02:37,123
- [Collins] Dude, that was absolutely nuts!

139
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:37,956
- [Devin] I know, right?

140
00:02:37,956 --> 00:02:38,789
It's my new favorite tool.

141
00:02:38,789 --> 00:02:39,784
Now I'm using a nice method

142
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:40,954
to gut this thing.

143
00:02:40,954 --> 00:02:42,450
- [Collins] Wait, what is that, Devin?

144
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,464
It looks like a portable windmill!

145
00:02:43,464 --> 00:02:44,297
- [Devin] Exactly!

146
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:45,130
It might even blow you away. You ready?

147
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:45,963
(lightning)

148
00:02:45,963 --> 00:02:46,796
Three, two, one

149
00:02:46,796 --> 00:02:47,629
(energy beam)

150
00:02:47,629 --> 00:02:48,462
- [Both] Whoa!

151
00:02:48,462 --> 00:02:49,295
- [Devin] Yep, totally worked.

152
00:02:49,295 --> 00:02:50,128
- [Collins} Yeet!

153
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,047
- [Collins] Well, as you do that, Devin,

154
00:02:51,047 --> 00:02:51,880
here we go.

155
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,788
I've got a couple substances over here.

156
00:02:52,788 --> 00:02:53,680
I've got some Isomalt--

157
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,513
- [Devin] Oh, need some mixing?

158
00:02:54,513 --> 00:02:55,346
- [Collins] NO!

159
00:02:55,346 --> 00:02:56,179
- [Devin] No? No mixing?

160
00:02:56,179 --> 00:02:57,012
- [Collins] No!

161
00:02:57,012 --> 00:02:57,845
- [Devin] I'll make sure not to mix!

162
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:58,678
- [Collins] Do not try this at home!

163
00:02:58,678 --> 00:02:59,511
It's hot Isomalt!

164
00:02:59,511 --> 00:03:00,344
I'm going to pour into the ice!

165
00:03:00,344 --> 00:03:01,638
It's going to create an insane art piece on the inside!

166
00:03:01,638 --> 00:03:02,471
Three

167
00:03:02,471 --> 00:03:03,304
- [Both] Two

168
00:03:03,304 --> 00:03:04,137
One

169
00:03:04,137 --> 00:03:04,970
- [Collins] You better watch out, Devin,

170
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:05,803
I'm coming for the art throne!

171
00:03:05,803 --> 00:03:06,636
- [Devin] All right!

172
00:03:06,636 --> 00:03:07,469
- [Collins] So, now, let's see,

173
00:03:07,469 --> 00:03:08,302
I'm just going to pour this around like this.

174
00:03:08,302 --> 00:03:09,135
- [BOTH] Whoa!

175
00:03:09,135 --> 00:03:10,492
- [Collins] It burns through the ice!

176
00:03:10,492 --> 00:03:11,363
- [Devin] Now it's time to gut the inside

177
00:03:11,363 --> 00:03:12,255
of my pumpkin!

178
00:03:12,255 --> 00:03:13,484
- [Collins] I'm getting splattered with pieces

179
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:14,317
of pumpkin, bro!

180
00:03:14,317 --> 00:03:15,150
- [Devin] Yeah!

181
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:15,983
- [Collins] Like, there's seeds flying out--

182
00:03:15,983 --> 00:03:16,816
- [Devin] It smells real bad now!

183
00:03:16,816 --> 00:03:17,649
- [Collins] Three, two, one.

184
00:03:17,649 --> 00:03:18,651
And dip it in like this.

185
00:03:18,651 --> 00:03:19,758
- [Both] Ohhhh!

186
00:03:19,758 --> 00:03:21,187
- [Devin] That's so nice!

187
00:03:21,187 --> 00:03:22,379
- [Collins] I wonder if they're going to,

188
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:23,941
like, intermix and mingle in the middle, man.

189
00:03:23,941 --> 00:03:24,834
It's like a little meet and greet.

190
00:03:24,834 --> 00:03:25,667
A little dating app.

191
00:03:25,667 --> 00:03:26,500
- [Devin] I know, right?

192
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,333
- [Collins] Here we go,

193
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:28,166
last bit of isomalt in in.

194
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,175
Got a whole bunch of hot water here,

195
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:30,008
and this is the coolest part.

196
00:03:30,008 --> 00:03:31,624
It is time to get out the isomalt art.

197
00:03:31,624 --> 00:03:32,457
Three

198
00:03:32,457 --> 00:03:33,290
- [Both] Two, one!

199
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:34,455
- [Collins] Just going to put it in like this.

200
00:03:34,455 --> 00:03:35,288
- [Both] Whoa!

201
00:03:35,288 --> 00:03:36,121
- [Devin] Nice!

202
00:03:36,121 --> 00:03:36,954
- [Collins] Look at it, man!

203
00:03:36,954 --> 00:03:37,787
It's melting the ice

204
00:03:37,787 --> 00:03:38,620
but not the isomalt!

205
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,514
- [Devin] It looks so deliciously blue!

206
00:03:39,514 --> 00:03:40,347
- [Collins] Bam! It is in!

207
00:03:40,347 --> 00:03:41,180
Gonna move this over here!

208
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,013
- [Devin] Whoa! Okay, okay, okay!

209
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:42,847
- [Collins] Time to pour out some of the

210
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:43,883
water here, oh my gosh, it got heavy.

211
00:03:43,883 --> 00:03:44,840
You ready? Here we go. Three,

212
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,707
- [Both] Two, one.

213
00:03:45,707 --> 00:03:46,540
- [Collins] I'm just going to lift

214
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,373
it up like this.

215
00:03:47,373 --> 00:03:48,206
All right, here we go.

216
00:03:48,206 --> 00:03:49,039
Oh!

217
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:49,872
- [Devin] That was close!

218
00:03:49,872 --> 00:03:51,778
- [Collins] Yo! Boom! Look at that!

219
00:03:51,778 --> 00:03:53,107
- [Devin] I just gotta finish gutting

220
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:53,940
this thing out!

221
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,180
- [Collins] All right, here's the big reveal.

222
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,423
- [Both] Three, two, one. (music)

223
00:03:56,423 --> 00:03:57,672
- [Collins] Yo! - [Devin] Whoa!

224
00:03:57,672 --> 00:03:59,047
- [Collins] Look at that! - [Devin] Whoa!

225
00:03:59,047 --> 00:03:59,880
- [Collins] That's so insane!

226
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,901
- [Devin] That looks absolutely nuts!

227
00:04:00,901 --> 00:04:01,791
- [Collins] Look at these pieces, man!

228
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:02,632
- [Devin] Good job!

229
00:04:02,632 --> 00:04:04,012
- [Collins] These are art pieces in and of themselves!

230
00:04:04,012 --> 00:04:05,099
Boom! Nailed it!

231
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:06,618
- [Devin] All right, gotta turn on the helium here.

232
00:04:06,618 --> 00:04:07,924
- [Collins] Wait wait wait wait wait wait what?

233
00:04:07,924 --> 00:04:08,880
- [Devin] I'm making an edible balloon.

234
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,713
- [Collins] What?

235
00:04:09,713 --> 00:04:10,546
- [Devin] What am I waiting for?

236
00:04:10,546 --> 00:04:11,379
- [Collins] When did this happen?

237
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:12,212
- [Devin] What do you mean?

238
00:04:12,212 --> 00:04:13,085
- [Collins] I just look over, you've got

239
00:04:13,085 --> 00:04:14,016
a dangling green thingy!

240
00:04:14,016 --> 00:04:14,849
- [Devin] Exactly!

241
00:04:14,849 --> 00:04:15,870
- [Collins] All right, I'm going to take this

242
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:16,745
right here, I'm going to drop it inside my cube.

243
00:04:16,745 --> 00:04:17,620
You're going to be able to blow up

244
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,453
a balloon with that?

245
00:04:18,453 --> 00:04:19,286
- [Devin] Yes.

246
00:04:19,286 --> 00:04:20,119
- [Both] Three, two, one.

247
00:04:20,119 --> 00:04:21,003
- [Devin] Let's see if it works.

248
00:04:21,003 --> 00:04:22,692
- [Both] Whoa!

249
00:04:22,692 --> 00:04:23,525
- [Collins] Turn it off, turn it off, turn it off!

250
00:04:23,525 --> 00:04:24,358
Turn it off, turn it off!

251
00:04:24,358 --> 00:04:25,191
- [Devin] Yes!

252
00:04:25,191 --> 00:04:26,314
Look at that! Look at that! Look at that!

253
00:04:26,314 --> 00:04:27,185
- [Collins] Okay, hold on, here's the real question.

254
00:04:27,185 --> 00:04:28,018
Will it float?

255
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:29,402
- [Both] Three, two, one.

256
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:30,561
- [Collins] Oh, my gosh, it's by a string!

257
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:31,394
- [Devin] Oh!

258
00:04:31,394 --> 00:04:32,227
- [Collins] Oh!

259
00:04:32,227 --> 00:04:33,265
- [Both] Oh!

260
00:04:33,265 --> 00:04:34,098
- [Collins] It's got stuck to the ceiling, though!

261
00:04:34,098 --> 00:04:34,931
It's stuck to the ceiling!

262
00:04:34,931 --> 00:04:35,914
- [Devin] Yes! - [Collins] Oh, my gosh

263
00:04:35,914 --> 00:04:37,540
- [Devin] Dude! - [Both] Yo!

264
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,614
- [Devin] Oh, no, it popped.

265
00:04:38,614 --> 00:04:39,589
All right, well, this is going to be

266
00:04:39,589 --> 00:04:41,028
the inner lining of my gadget.

267
00:04:41,028 --> 00:04:42,252
- [Collins] Thing is, this is going to be a tesseract.

268
00:04:42,252 --> 00:04:43,945
I want some alien abilities coming out of this thing.

269
00:04:43,945 --> 00:04:45,582
My tesseract does not fit in this thing,

270
00:04:45,582 --> 00:04:47,143
so we're going to have to get a little bit creative here.

271
00:04:47,143 --> 00:04:48,022
Kind of bop some edges.

272
00:04:48,022 --> 00:04:49,297
All right, we've got the claws here,

273
00:04:49,297 --> 00:04:50,130
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

274
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,058
- and now it's time to bust this thing up!

275
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:51,891
- No, dude, you need glasses!

276
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:52,724
Safety glasses

277
00:04:52,724 --> 00:04:53,557
- Safety first, of course.

278
00:04:53,557 --> 00:04:54,390
don't try this at home!

279
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,223
- [Devin] Safety first!

280
00:04:55,223 --> 00:04:56,227
- [Collins] Be very careful there with that!

281
00:04:56,227 --> 00:04:57,060
- Careful, Collins, careful, close your eyes!

282
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:57,893
There you go, there you go!

283
00:04:57,893 --> 00:04:58,726
- All right, there we go!

284
00:04:58,726 --> 00:04:59,559
- [Devin] We got it! All right! All right!

285
00:04:59,559 --> 00:05:00,392
- [Collins] Perfect, thank you!

286
00:05:00,392 --> 00:05:01,225
- [Devin] All right, all right, I need mine now.

287
00:05:01,225 --> 00:05:02,232
I gotta go, very, very safely.

288
00:05:02,232 --> 00:05:03,251
- [Collins] I'll keep my claws pointed down.

289
00:05:03,251 --> 00:05:04,335
Okay, I'll shuffle this way. All right.

290
00:05:04,335 --> 00:05:05,168
- Where are they?

291
00:05:05,168 --> 00:05:06,001
Oh, here they are.

292
00:05:06,001 --> 00:05:06,834
- [Collins] Can we trade places?

293
00:05:06,834 --> 00:05:07,667
- Yes, yes.

294
00:05:07,667 --> 00:05:08,500
- [Collins] I'm going to shuffle this way again.

295
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,873
It's going to slice off the side, a little wa-chink.

296
00:05:09,873 --> 00:05:10,706
What are you doing?

297
00:05:10,706 --> 00:05:11,738
- [Devin] I'm filling up on the inside

298
00:05:11,738 --> 00:05:13,075
for the inner lining of my gadget.

299
00:05:13,075 --> 00:05:14,156
- [Collins] It doesn't look like

300
00:05:14,156 --> 00:05:14,989
it's working, Devin.

301
00:05:14,989 --> 00:05:15,822
- [Devin] It's not.

302
00:05:15,822 --> 00:05:16,655
- [Collins] Three.

303
00:05:16,655 --> 00:05:17,488
- [Both] Two, one.

304
00:05:17,488 --> 00:05:18,719
- [Collins] Oh! - [Devin] Oh, no!

305
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,256
- [Collins] Yes! And then, I don't want to break too much

306
00:05:20,256 --> 00:05:21,354
of it, but here we go. Let's do three, two one-

307
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:22,248
(yells)

308
00:05:22,248 --> 00:05:23,684
Woo hoo hoo! Lastly, I've got some

309
00:05:23,684 --> 00:05:25,429
agar agar here, I'm going to add in.

310
00:05:25,429 --> 00:05:26,940
It's going to solidify into a cube,

311
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,143
and look just like the Tesseract.

312
00:05:28,143 --> 00:05:29,449
- [Both] Three, two, one.

313
00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:30,508
- [Collins] I'm just going to pour this in.

314
00:05:30,508 --> 00:05:31,606
- Whoa, okay, all right!

315
00:05:31,606 --> 00:05:32,951
- So, here we go, just going to pour it in,

316
00:05:32,951 --> 00:05:34,292
like this, all the way up to the very,

317
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:35,344
very tippity top.

318
00:05:35,344 --> 00:05:36,641
Whoa! That was close!

319
00:05:36,641 --> 00:05:37,895
Now I'm going to set this off to the side

320
00:05:37,895 --> 00:05:39,071
to set, and it's time for the next part of

321
00:05:39,071 --> 00:05:39,924
my Goblin Gadget.

322
00:05:39,924 --> 00:05:40,757
All right, next I've got to carefully slice

323
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,725
my watermelon with a shovel.

324
00:05:42,725 --> 00:05:44,866
You know me, I'm very controlled and very precise.

325
00:05:44,866 --> 00:05:48,655
- [Devin] What? - [Both] Three, two, one. Yow!

326
00:05:48,655 --> 00:05:49,488
- [Devin] Whoopsie!

327
00:05:49,488 --> 00:05:50,955
- [Collins] I missed it! Oh my gosh!

328
00:05:50,955 --> 00:05:51,788
All right, we're going to get

329
00:05:51,788 --> 00:05:52,976
a little side hit on here

330
00:05:52,976 --> 00:05:54,158
with three, two, one, yow! Oh!

331
00:05:54,158 --> 00:05:55,000
- [Devin] Well, then!

332
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,126
- [Collins] Here we go,

333
00:05:56,126 --> 00:05:56,959
We have the top here.

334
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:58,230
We're going to grab some Wolverine claws,

335
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,263
again, do not try this at home!

336
00:05:59,263 --> 00:06:01,192
- [Devin] Check out this awesome pumpkin carving tool!

337
00:06:01,192 --> 00:06:02,025
Look at this!

338
00:06:02,025 --> 00:06:02,858
It's motorized!

339
00:06:02,858 --> 00:06:03,743
- [Collins] Here we go!

340
00:06:03,743 --> 00:06:04,896
- It's getting watermelon juice on my pumpkin!

341
00:06:04,896 --> 00:06:06,021
- [Collins] Bleah! There we go! Nice!

342
00:06:06,021 --> 00:06:08,161
(grunting)

343
00:06:08,161 --> 00:06:09,276
(yells)

344
00:06:09,276 --> 00:06:11,600
Oh, it's heavy like that.

345
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,738
There we go, man.

346
00:06:12,738 --> 00:06:14,146
At least, time for a plunger, man,

347
00:06:14,146 --> 00:06:15,427
this thing's brand new, fully sanitized,

348
00:06:15,427 --> 00:06:16,260
here we go, three, two, one.

349
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,688
Let's see, oh! - [Devin] Whoa!

350
00:06:17,688 --> 00:06:18,758
What are you doing?

351
00:06:18,758 --> 00:06:20,093
- [Collins] I gotta plunge the inside

352
00:06:20,093 --> 00:06:21,148
- -Why? Why, though?

353
00:06:21,148 --> 00:06:22,228
- of it, man, that's how you fully

354
00:06:22,228 --> 00:06:23,425
clean it out, man. Because this is

355
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:24,258
how you do it, man!

356
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:25,931
- [Devin] I'm just going to continue back over here.

357
00:06:25,931 --> 00:06:26,764
- [Collins] I think, all in all,

358
00:06:26,764 --> 00:06:27,851
my watermelon's pretty nicely cleared.

359
00:06:27,851 --> 00:06:29,828
Oh, no! I ripped a whole in the side of it!

360
00:06:29,828 --> 00:06:30,869
- [Devin] That's what you're concerned about?

361
00:06:30,869 --> 00:06:33,332
Not the fact that your entire melon is all over our counter?

362
00:06:33,332 --> 00:06:34,778
(popping)

363
00:06:34,778 --> 00:06:35,789
- [Collins] You know, I think we're

364
00:06:35,789 --> 00:06:36,724
going to have to start all over with

365
00:06:36,724 --> 00:06:37,557
a brand new melon and go

366
00:06:37,557 --> 00:06:39,333
a little more carefully like you've done, Devin.

367
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:40,247
All right, we've got all the elements,

368
00:06:40,247 --> 00:06:42,256
time to put together our Green Goblin Gadget.

369
00:06:42,256 --> 00:06:44,159
I've got my Tesseract here, it's been fully set.

370
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:45,920
But I gotta say, man, this is a lot more giggly

371
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,798
than I expected it to be.

372
00:06:46,798 --> 00:06:48,044
- [Devin] This stuff looks so delicious!

373
00:06:48,044 --> 00:06:48,877
- [Collins] What is that?

374
00:06:48,877 --> 00:06:49,809
- [Devin] This is my D.I.Y. yogurt.

375
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:51,173
- [Collins] Oh, so you're going to put that on the inside?

376
00:06:51,173 --> 00:06:52,454
I take my Tesseract, and I've got to

377
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:53,388
be very quick with this,

378
00:06:53,388 --> 00:06:54,421
I'm going to flip it upside down.

379
00:06:54,421 --> 00:06:55,254
So, oh, my gosh.

380
00:06:55,254 --> 00:06:56,299
Looks like Play-Dough, almost, man.

381
00:06:56,299 --> 00:06:57,591
- [Devin] Exteme concentration going on

382
00:06:57,591 --> 00:06:58,424
over here, all right?

383
00:06:58,424 --> 00:07:00,357
- [Collins] This thing is so much heavier than I expected.

384
00:07:00,357 --> 00:07:01,190
So, here we go, I gotta do this very carefully.

385
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:04,262
Three, two, one. Wa-boom! - [Devin] Did it work?

386
00:07:04,262 --> 00:07:05,547
- [Both] Three, two, one.

387
00:07:05,547 --> 00:07:06,493
- [Collins] I'm going to lift it off,

388
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:07,689
you can hear it, I can hear it coming off.

389
00:07:07,689 --> 00:07:09,586
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

390
00:07:09,586 --> 00:07:10,419
- -Oh!

391
00:07:10,419 --> 00:07:11,252
- Okay, bam! (screams)

392
00:07:11,252 --> 00:07:12,085
NO!

393
00:07:12,987 --> 00:07:14,013
I don't like you!

394
00:07:14,013 --> 00:07:15,222
This almost ruined it all, man!

395
00:07:15,222 --> 00:07:16,055
- [Devin] Wow!

396
00:07:16,055 --> 00:07:17,325
I have mycelium husk slime, here.

397
00:07:17,325 --> 00:07:18,633
- Wait, wait, wait, let me see if it--

398
00:07:18,633 --> 00:07:19,466
- [Both] Whoa!

399
00:07:19,466 --> 00:07:20,521
- [Devin] I'm starting to add it! Yes!

400
00:07:20,521 --> 00:07:21,354
- [Collins] Holy cow!

401
00:07:21,354 --> 00:07:22,187
All right, so here we go.

402
00:07:22,187 --> 00:07:23,088
So, we got the watermelon,

403
00:07:23,088 --> 00:07:24,304
we're going to place this right here.

404
00:07:24,304 --> 00:07:25,137
We've got to get the Tesseract up

405
00:07:25,137 --> 00:07:26,036
and inside of it, so here we go.

406
00:07:26,036 --> 00:07:26,869
Oh, man, it is,

407
00:07:26,869 --> 00:07:27,702
(groans)

408
00:07:27,702 --> 00:07:29,122
it feels so weird.

409
00:07:29,122 --> 00:07:30,202
All right, let's see.

410
00:07:30,202 --> 00:07:31,093
Let's lift it up like this.

411
00:07:31,093 --> 00:07:31,936
Oh, it's falling apart, falling apart,

412
00:07:31,936 --> 00:07:33,456
here we go, drip it in, drip it in.

413
00:07:33,456 --> 00:07:34,289
(sound effect)

414
00:07:34,289 --> 00:07:35,133
- Oh, no, no, no, no!

415
00:07:35,133 --> 00:07:36,181
- [Devin] You broke the Tesseract, man!

416
00:07:36,181 --> 00:07:37,352
- [Collins] I didn't break it Devin, it all

417
00:07:37,352 --> 00:07:39,136
went according to plan! It just happened to,

418
00:07:39,136 --> 00:07:41,199
we're just going to pick up the pieces

419
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,032
and put them in.

420
00:07:42,032 --> 00:07:43,419
I gotta say, I was hoping it would stay

421
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:44,816
in a square shape, it didn't.

422
00:07:44,816 --> 00:07:46,444
So, here we go. Spun honey is going to go in,

423
00:07:46,444 --> 00:07:47,277
around the top.

424
00:07:47,277 --> 00:07:48,443
All right, we've got all the elements,

425
00:07:48,443 --> 00:07:49,276
now it's time to compile them.

426
00:07:49,276 --> 00:07:51,619
Put them together, add the finishing touches,

427
00:07:51,619 --> 00:07:52,969
and make these things look incredible.

428
00:07:52,969 --> 00:07:54,156
We've got the finished Goblin Gadgets,

429
00:07:54,156 --> 00:07:55,590
and these things turned out absolutely--

430
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:56,423
- I know, right?

431
00:07:56,423 --> 00:07:57,979
- Insane, man! I mean, like yours is so cool,

432
00:07:57,979 --> 00:07:58,812
I gotta say Devin was very kind.

433
00:07:58,812 --> 00:07:59,762
He helped me out with a couple different elements of mine.

434
00:07:59,762 --> 00:08:00,595
- Yes.

435
00:08:00,595 --> 00:08:01,930
- So, here is the big reveal. You ready?

436
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:04,454
- [Both] Three, two, one. Ta-da!

437
00:08:04,454 --> 00:08:05,411
- [Collins] Yes! - [Devin] What?

438
00:08:05,411 --> 00:08:07,779
Dude, I cannot wait to throw these off of a balcony!

439
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:09,932
- [Collins] So, you get to comment down below

440
00:08:09,932 --> 00:08:11,210
which one is going to look cooler when we throw

441
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:12,206
it off the top of the balcony and

442
00:08:12,206 --> 00:08:13,348
do the drop test. We'll be doing that

443
00:08:13,348 --> 00:08:14,480
at the end of the video.

444
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,281
Now, we're making Captain America shields

445
00:08:16,281 --> 00:08:17,329
and I'm kicking mine off with a bang.

446
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:18,242
- [Both] Three, two, one.

447
00:08:18,242 --> 00:08:19,075
- [Collins] It's in!

448
00:08:19,075 --> 00:08:20,348
- [Both] (screaming)

449
00:08:20,348 --> 00:08:23,681
(slow motion screaming)

450
00:08:25,807 --> 00:08:27,781
- [Devin] Wait, how are you catching this?

451
00:08:27,781 --> 00:08:29,222
- (slow motion screaming)

452
00:08:29,222 --> 00:08:30,341
- [Collins] Oh, no!

453
00:08:30,341 --> 00:08:31,174
- Dude!

454
00:08:31,174 --> 00:08:32,007
- I'm trying to-

455
00:08:32,007 --> 00:08:32,840
- What are you doing?

456
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,772
- Here we go, there we go, here we go!

457
00:08:33,772 --> 00:08:34,749
And then we just pour it in.

458
00:08:34,749 --> 00:08:36,347
- What are you doing? Is that it?

459
00:08:36,347 --> 00:08:37,353
- [Collins] All things considered, that went

460
00:08:37,353 --> 00:08:38,186
a lot better than it could've.

461
00:08:38,186 --> 00:08:39,110
- [Devin] Are you kidding?

462
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,058
For the first layer of my Captain America shield.

463
00:08:40,058 --> 00:08:41,888
I'm pouring hot isomalt on this exercise ball.

464
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:43,740
I've got a super-cool way of painting my shield.

465
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,970
Are you ready for this?

466
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:45,918
- [Collins] So, you're going to put the paints on?

467
00:08:45,918 --> 00:08:47,342
- [Devin] Yes, I made some edible paint right here.

468
00:08:47,342 --> 00:08:49,056
And then you just put it down, boom!

469
00:08:49,056 --> 00:08:49,889
- Whoa! - Look at that!

470
00:08:49,889 --> 00:08:51,189
- [Collins] That is, like, mesmerizing, man!

471
00:08:51,189 --> 00:08:52,054
- [Devin] I know, right?

472
00:08:52,054 --> 00:08:54,165
I'm going to reinforce my shield with some coconut!

473
00:08:54,165 --> 00:08:55,728
- [Collins] And I've got a giant whisk here

474
00:08:55,728 --> 00:08:56,561
because I am Whisk-Man!

475
00:08:56,561 --> 00:08:57,412
Check it out! Bam!

476
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:58,702
- [Devin] Nothing's more solid than coconut.

477
00:08:58,702 --> 00:08:59,535
(glass breaking off camera)

478
00:08:59,535 --> 00:09:00,368
- [Collins] Oh! - [Devin] What did you hit?

479
00:09:00,368 --> 00:09:01,517
- [Collins] Nothing!

480
00:09:01,517 --> 00:09:02,473
- What are you doing?

481
00:09:02,473 --> 00:09:03,843
- [Devin] I'm making a coconut blancmange

482
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:04,704
to reinforce my shield.

483
00:09:04,704 --> 00:09:06,739
- [Collins] Ah, yes, nothing like a little coconut blanc-

484
00:09:06,739 --> 00:09:07,763
- Blancmange.

485
00:09:07,763 --> 00:09:08,596
- Blancwonge--

486
00:09:08,596 --> 00:09:09,669
- I don't even know how to spell it.

487
00:09:09,669 --> 00:09:10,573
- [Collins] All right, well, here we go.

488
00:09:10,573 --> 00:09:11,406
You do that. Time for me to

489
00:09:11,406 --> 00:09:12,251
whisk around my aquafaba right here,

490
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:13,084
what are you doing?

491
00:09:13,084 --> 00:09:13,917
- [Devin] I bet you're jealous.

492
00:09:13,917 --> 00:09:14,750
- [Collins] Of what?

493
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:15,583
- My liquid nitrogen.

494
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:16,416
All right, time to remove my coconuts.

495
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:17,249
- [Collins] And I'm adding in a whole bunch

496
00:09:17,249 --> 00:09:18,440
of agar agar, and this is going to make mine

497
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,273
really thick.

498
00:09:19,273 --> 00:09:20,106
- [Devin] Look! - [Collins] Holy cow!

499
00:09:20,106 --> 00:09:20,939
What is going on?

500
00:09:20,939 --> 00:09:21,772
- Now is time to smash it!

501
00:09:21,772 --> 00:09:22,605
- Wait, wait, with a hammer!

502
00:09:22,605 --> 00:09:23,438
- What?

503
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:24,271
All right, here we go--

504
00:09:24,271 --> 00:09:25,104
- [Both] Three, two,

505
00:09:25,104 --> 00:09:25,937
- [Collins] Wait, wait, wait.

506
00:09:25,937 --> 00:09:26,770
Three second like challenge.

507
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:27,730
We want to see if you can like this video in three seconds.

508
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:28,797
You ready? Here we go.

509
00:09:28,797 --> 00:09:31,425
- [Both] Three, two, one! Done!

510
00:09:31,425 --> 00:09:33,092
Three, two, one! Oh!

511
00:09:35,939 --> 00:09:38,072
- (slow motion) Oh!

512
00:09:38,072 --> 00:09:38,905
- [Devin] Wow!

513
00:09:38,905 --> 00:09:39,764
- [Collins] Look at the inside!

514
00:09:39,764 --> 00:09:40,597
- [Devin] Look at that!

515
00:09:40,597 --> 00:09:42,317
- [Collins] I have never seen a coconut

516
00:09:42,317 --> 00:09:43,622
filled this much, man!

517
00:09:43,622 --> 00:09:45,560
I'm covered in coconut juice!

518
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,448
- [Devin] Serves you right!

519
00:09:46,448 --> 00:09:47,281
- [Collins] It's delicious.

520
00:09:47,281 --> 00:09:48,266
- [Devin] Now that I froze everything

521
00:09:48,266 --> 00:09:50,041
I have to unfreeze it inside this pan.

522
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:50,874
- [Collins] Dude look at this!

523
00:09:50,874 --> 00:09:52,106
The agar agars coming together.

524
00:09:52,106 --> 00:09:52,947
Man, look at it bro.

525
00:09:52,947 --> 00:09:55,074
- [Devin] Oh I can smell coconut already.

526
00:09:55,074 --> 00:09:56,224
- [Collins] I just had an idea bro

527
00:09:56,224 --> 00:09:57,731
What if we make aquafaba bubbles dude?

528
00:09:57,731 --> 00:09:59,149
All right here we go, just going to pour in

529
00:09:59,149 --> 00:09:59,982
some of the juice right now.

530
00:09:59,982 --> 00:10:01,535
We're going to strain it out, lets see like this.

531
00:10:01,535 --> 00:10:03,710
Check this out and this is what's going to get really crazy.

532
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:04,989
Gonna open up a tank of helium right now

533
00:10:04,989 --> 00:10:06,821
and its going to infuse all the aquafaba juice.

534
00:10:06,821 --> 00:10:08,931
And who knows what's going to happen next so here we go.

535
00:10:08,931 --> 00:10:09,764
You ready?

536
00:10:09,764 --> 00:10:11,631
- [Both] Three, two, one. - [Collins] Yoooo!

537
00:10:11,631 --> 00:10:12,464
- [Devin] What! Dude!

538
00:10:12,464 --> 00:10:13,514
- [Collins] Oh here's the question though

539
00:10:13,514 --> 00:10:14,466
Because of the bubbles,

540
00:10:14,466 --> 00:10:15,299
- [Devin] Yes!

541
00:10:15,299 --> 00:10:16,292
- [Collins] is there any way of actually making it

542
00:10:16,292 --> 00:10:17,125
float in the air, do you think?

543
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,291
- [Devin] Oh wait, yes! And be very careful

544
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:19,124
- [Collins] Yeah yeah!

545
00:10:19,124 --> 00:10:19,957
- [Devin] Do not try this at home.

546
00:10:19,957 --> 00:10:20,790
- [Collins] Exactly!

547
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,623
- [Devin] Here we go. Three.

548
00:10:21,623 --> 00:10:22,456
- [Both] Two, one. Yooo!

549
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:23,909
- Oh, no, no!

550
00:10:23,909 --> 00:10:25,027
- [Collins] Get it off the ceiling. Get it off the ceiling.

551
00:10:25,027 --> 00:10:26,463
Get it off the ceiling. Get it off the ceiling bro!

552
00:10:26,463 --> 00:10:27,632
- [Devin] Try it again. Try it again. Try it again.

553
00:10:27,632 --> 00:10:28,545
- [Collins] Oh my god, it's like dripping all this juice.

554
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,197
Dude it floated up perfectly man.

555
00:10:30,197 --> 00:10:31,079
- [Devin] That was awesome.

556
00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:31,999
- [Collins] Yo, wait, wait, wait, I have an idea bro.

557
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:32,832
What if I actually just dunk on it?

558
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:33,907
- [Devin] Three, two, one.

559
00:10:33,907 --> 00:10:34,988
There you go. There you go.

560
00:10:34,988 --> 00:10:37,574
(football crashes)

561
00:10:37,574 --> 00:10:38,772
- [Devin] I think you totally missed.

562
00:10:38,772 --> 00:10:42,299
- [Collins] The way that the bubbles are going, I think it..

563
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:43,155
I think it worked.

564
00:10:43,155 --> 00:10:44,421
- [Devin] Dude, one of the mic things fell off!

565
00:10:44,421 --> 00:10:45,422
- [Collins] How did that get there?!

566
00:10:45,422 --> 00:10:46,808
All right well we gotta, oh boy that's a

567
00:10:46,808 --> 00:10:47,806
that's gonna be an issue.

568
00:10:47,806 --> 00:10:50,199
This took quite awhile but I made some puffed rice over here

569
00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:52,475
and I made it in the ginger ale that I used earlier.

570
00:10:52,475 --> 00:10:53,714
See there was a purpose for it Devin!

571
00:10:53,714 --> 00:10:55,217
- [Devin] Yeah well, I've been mixing around

572
00:10:55,217 --> 00:10:56,574
this agar agar stuff for a while.

573
00:10:56,574 --> 00:10:58,549
So now it's time to grab the Isomalt.

574
00:10:58,549 --> 00:11:00,539
- [Collins] It's gotta be very carefully done.

575
00:11:00,539 --> 00:11:02,302
- [Devin] Yooo! That looks so incredile.

576
00:11:02,302 --> 00:11:03,258
- [Collins] Very carefully.

577
00:11:03,258 --> 00:11:05,290
- [Devin] So now I need to do this one-handed

578
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,279
cause I got the silver leaf on the bottom.

579
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:07,132
- [Collins] Do you want me to help you out with this at all?

580
00:11:07,132 --> 00:11:07,965
- [Devin] No, please don't.

581
00:11:07,965 --> 00:11:08,798
- [Collins] I mean, it makes sense.

582
00:11:08,798 --> 00:11:09,631
As you do that, I'm gonna strain out my rice over here.

583
00:11:09,631 --> 00:11:10,464
- [Devin] All right.

584
00:11:10,464 --> 00:11:11,456
- So here we are, just gonna dump it in here like this.

585
00:11:11,456 --> 00:11:13,406
- [Devin] My shield is gonna be extra reinforced now.

586
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:15,171
- [Collins] All right let's see if you can waffle rice!

587
00:11:15,171 --> 00:11:16,661
Here we go. Gonna add the puff rice in.

588
00:11:16,661 --> 00:11:17,679
(murmurs)

589
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:19,739
- [Devin] I'm risking it all for this reinforcement.

590
00:11:19,739 --> 00:11:21,234
- [Collins] Yeah, you're really gonna need it man.

591
00:11:21,234 --> 00:11:23,076
Cause if you can get this and your shield will not break

592
00:11:23,076 --> 00:11:24,584
when I punch it with my fist.

593
00:11:24,584 --> 00:11:25,734
- [Devin] Exactly.

594
00:11:25,734 --> 00:11:26,857
- [Collins] Here we go.

595
00:11:26,857 --> 00:11:27,793
Gonna open this up on the count of three.

596
00:11:27,793 --> 00:11:28,626
Three.

597
00:11:28,626 --> 00:11:29,992
- [Both] Two, one. Yooooo!

598
00:11:29,992 --> 00:11:31,151
- [Collins] I've got the aquafabo.

599
00:11:31,151 --> 00:11:33,409
Now it's time to add in a whole bunch of my puffed rice.

600
00:11:33,409 --> 00:11:34,782
Right now it's gonna dry out

601
00:11:34,782 --> 00:11:36,586
and turn into the base of my shield.

602
00:11:36,586 --> 00:11:37,926
- [Devin] We've don't a lot with liquid nitrogen

603
00:11:37,926 --> 00:11:39,760
but we've never filled up a water blaster with it!

604
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,593
- [Collins] A what?!

605
00:11:40,593 --> 00:11:41,426
Hold on.

606
00:11:41,426 --> 00:11:42,259
(screams)

607
00:11:42,259 --> 00:11:43,190
- [Devin] I gotta spray it on my --

608
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:44,023
- [Collins] All right now!

609
00:11:44,023 --> 00:11:45,133
- [Devin] To get them cold and remember

610
00:11:45,133 --> 00:11:46,284
do not try this at home!

611
00:11:46,284 --> 00:11:47,552
- [Collins] Yes! Don't try this at home.

612
00:11:47,552 --> 00:11:48,385
Oh my gosh!

613
00:11:48,385 --> 00:11:49,218
- [Devin] Three, two, one.

614
00:11:49,218 --> 00:11:50,051
- [Both] Oh!

615
00:11:50,051 --> 00:11:50,884
- [Devin] It didn't work.

616
00:11:50,884 --> 00:11:51,717
- [Collins] Did it go?

617
00:11:51,717 --> 00:11:52,550
- [Devin] No! You can tell it's in here though.

618
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:53,668
- (mumbles) I lost my balloon, sorry I got it.

619
00:11:53,668 --> 00:11:54,501
- [Devin] Okay!

620
00:11:54,501 --> 00:11:55,334
- [Collins] I lost my balloon.

621
00:11:55,334 --> 00:11:56,167
(screams)

622
00:11:56,167 --> 00:11:57,017
- [Devin] Well, that really did not work.

623
00:11:57,017 --> 00:11:58,405
So I guess I'm gonna have to try something else.

624
00:11:58,405 --> 00:11:59,412
- Can you please hold this in place for me

625
00:11:59,412 --> 00:12:00,245
for a second Devin?

626
00:12:00,245 --> 00:12:01,078
- [Devin] Place them in here. What?

627
00:12:01,078 --> 00:12:01,911
- [Collins] Can you please hold this in place for me

628
00:12:01,911 --> 00:12:02,744
for a second. So here we go.

629
00:12:02,744 --> 00:12:03,577
- [Devin] Yeah sure. Yeah yeah. Oh, oh! Dude! What?!

630
00:12:03,577 --> 00:12:04,410
Are you kidding?!

631
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:05,243
- [Collins] I'm Sorry.

632
00:12:05,243 --> 00:12:06,076
(chatters)

633
00:12:06,076 --> 00:12:06,909
- [Collins] Can you just grab my balloon for me?

634
00:12:06,909 --> 00:12:08,024
Over here we've got my puff rising aquafaba.

635
00:12:08,024 --> 00:12:09,083
So time to actually add this on to the balloon

636
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:10,195
and use the balloon--

637
00:12:10,195 --> 00:12:11,028
- [Devin] Here you go. Catch!

638
00:12:11,028 --> 00:12:12,434
- [Collins] Gonna use the balloon as the mold

639
00:12:12,434 --> 00:12:13,620
and the base of my shield.

640
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,350
I think the chunk will actually be able to weigh it down.

641
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,299
All right, so here we go.

642
00:12:16,299 --> 00:12:17,284
Next up, just gonna grab the uh--

643
00:12:17,284 --> 00:12:18,119
(shrieks) No!

644
00:12:18,119 --> 00:12:19,280
- [Devin] What happened?

645
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,113
- Ah! I lost it!

646
00:12:20,113 --> 00:12:22,268
It flipped off and collected a whole bunch of peanuts man.

647
00:12:22,268 --> 00:12:23,324
- [Devin] All right I got it.

648
00:12:23,324 --> 00:12:24,157
- [Collins] Thank you.

649
00:12:24,157 --> 00:12:25,456
- [Devin] Here you go. Here you go.

650
00:12:25,456 --> 00:12:26,289
Sorry.

651
00:12:26,289 --> 00:12:27,122
- [Collins] Holy Cow!

652
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:28,478
- Next up, we gotta grab some red right over here.

653
00:12:28,478 --> 00:12:29,311
So here we go.

654
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,144
How's yours coming along?

655
00:12:30,144 --> 00:12:31,202
- [Devin] It's coming along pretty good.

656
00:12:31,202 --> 00:12:32,564
It's pretty not blended up at all.

657
00:12:32,564 --> 00:12:33,549
I have to blend this more.

658
00:12:33,549 --> 00:12:36,127
All right the final step is to place down this screen here.

659
00:12:36,127 --> 00:12:38,077
- [Collins] Is that from a screen window, Devin?

660
00:12:38,077 --> 00:12:39,425
Dan's gonna be not happy about that.

661
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,744
- [Devin] My shield is way more important than our window.

662
00:12:41,744 --> 00:12:43,074
Now I'm gonna squeegee it around.

663
00:12:43,074 --> 00:12:44,984
- [Collins] That's not how you use a squeegee man.

664
00:12:44,984 --> 00:12:46,189
I guess that's a creative way of using a squeegee.

665
00:12:46,189 --> 00:12:48,001
- [Devin] It's true. It's not how you traditionally use it.

666
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:49,595
- [Collins] Time to combine all the elements

667
00:12:49,595 --> 00:12:52,014
and make this into a true edible Captain America Shield

668
00:12:52,014 --> 00:12:53,290
that will blow your mind.

669
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:54,290
We've got the finished Captain America Shield

670
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:55,123
- [Devin] Yup!

671
00:12:55,123 --> 00:12:55,973
- [Collins] So here's the big reveal. You ready?

672
00:12:55,973 --> 00:12:56,806
Here we go.

673
00:12:56,806 --> 00:12:59,116
- [Both] Three, two, one. Ta-da!

674
00:12:59,116 --> 00:13:00,228
- [Collins] Look at these things bro!

675
00:13:00,228 --> 00:13:01,817
They turned out so brazy man.

676
00:13:01,817 --> 00:13:02,903
- This is amazing.

677
00:13:02,903 --> 00:13:04,925
- [Collins] So much work it took to get these.

678
00:13:04,925 --> 00:13:06,562
So you get to comment down below whose shield

679
00:13:06,562 --> 00:13:07,660
you think turned out better

680
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,148
and which one is going to taste better.

681
00:13:09,148 --> 00:13:10,995
We spent a long time on these.

682
00:13:10,995 --> 00:13:12,652
We will be trying them at the end of the video.

683
00:13:12,652 --> 00:13:13,651
And stick around to see us throw

684
00:13:13,651 --> 00:13:15,377
the green goblet gadgets off the balcony.

685
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:17,213
You challenged us to make edible infinity gauntlets

686
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,767
we could actually wear. So right now let's go.

687
00:13:19,767 --> 00:13:21,603
- [Collins] I'm kicking off by making some crunchy honey

688
00:13:21,603 --> 00:13:22,829
with honey and liquid nitrogen.

689
00:13:22,829 --> 00:13:23,921
What are you making Devin?

690
00:13:23,921 --> 00:13:26,072
- [Devin] I'm making Japanese jelly with agar-agar,

691
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:27,534
stevia, and water.

692
00:13:27,534 --> 00:13:30,114
- That looks like some weird underwater aqua planet.

693
00:13:30,114 --> 00:13:32,529
- [Devin] All right, now it's time to put the jelly

694
00:13:32,529 --> 00:13:33,362
on to the subwoofer.

695
00:13:33,362 --> 00:13:34,195
It's going on the top, dude.

696
00:13:34,195 --> 00:13:35,510
This is how I'm going to mix my color.

697
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,343
- [Collins] All right, so here's the deal.

698
00:13:36,343 --> 00:13:37,579
Gotta kinda move my honey around

699
00:13:37,579 --> 00:13:38,679
just like the liquid nitrogen.

700
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:40,717
Try to get all parts of it frozen right now. Here we go!

701
00:13:40,717 --> 00:13:42,392
Next up, we're gonna pull out this thingy here.

702
00:13:42,392 --> 00:13:43,225
So here we go.

703
00:13:43,225 --> 00:13:44,950
- [Devin] It's a strainer. That's what it's called.

704
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:45,948
- [Collins] Let's see if I can hook it on the bottom.

705
00:13:45,948 --> 00:13:46,781
(screams)

706
00:13:46,781 --> 00:13:47,614
- What?!

707
00:13:47,614 --> 00:13:48,447
- [Devin] That is crazy.

708
00:13:48,447 --> 00:13:49,384
- [Collins] Holy Cow!

709
00:13:49,384 --> 00:13:50,217
- Whoa!

710
00:13:50,217 --> 00:13:51,644
- [Collins] Oh! It just fell a part!

711
00:13:51,644 --> 00:13:52,895
- [Devin] That is some crunchy honey.

712
00:13:52,895 --> 00:13:54,352
Now it's time to turn on my speaker.

713
00:13:54,352 --> 00:13:55,396
Three, two, one.

714
00:13:55,396 --> 00:13:56,914
There we go! Oh, oh, oh, oh!

715
00:13:56,914 --> 00:13:58,638
- [Collins] That feels like an alien right there.

716
00:13:58,638 --> 00:14:00,339
Like an alien that would happen in Marvel.

717
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,538
- [Devin] I have to now put on some food coloring.

718
00:14:01,538 --> 00:14:02,690
You might want to step back, so you don't turn purple.

719
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:03,523
All right?

720
00:14:03,523 --> 00:14:04,661
- [Collins] Okay, yup. I'm going to uh--

721
00:14:04,661 --> 00:14:05,585
- [Devin] Here we go, here we go!

722
00:14:05,585 --> 00:14:06,550
- I don't know where to go!

723
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,389
- [Devin] Here we go!

724
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:08,222
- I don't know where to go!

725
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,055
- [Devin] Three, two, one.

726
00:14:09,055 --> 00:14:09,888
All right, it's doing kinda--

727
00:14:09,888 --> 00:14:10,757
Oh no! It's all over the table.

728
00:14:10,757 --> 00:14:12,176
All right dude. I think it totally worked. Yes!

729
00:14:12,176 --> 00:14:14,225
- [Collins] That's a life hack I never thought I would see.

730
00:14:14,225 --> 00:14:15,626
As you're doing that, I'm just gonna keep

731
00:14:15,626 --> 00:14:16,675
pounding this up into little pieces.

732
00:14:16,675 --> 00:14:17,546
- [Devin] Now it's time to add some blue

733
00:14:17,546 --> 00:14:18,454
right in here like this.

734
00:14:18,454 --> 00:14:19,956
- Whoa! Look at that!

735
00:14:19,956 --> 00:14:21,153
- Oh my gosh!

736
00:14:21,153 --> 00:14:22,428
- [Collins] I'm blown away by this.

737
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:23,329
- [Devin] Wow!

738
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,461
Now I'm going to add some green in here like this.

739
00:14:25,461 --> 00:14:27,136
- [Collins] It looks kinda like slime.

740
00:14:27,136 --> 00:14:28,341
- [Devin] That stuff flies everywhere.

741
00:14:28,341 --> 00:14:30,087
- [Collins] Yeah it's like projectile man.

742
00:14:30,087 --> 00:14:31,825
Next up, we've got some stones over here.

743
00:14:31,825 --> 00:14:33,633
I'm gonna use these stones to place in the mold

744
00:14:33,633 --> 00:14:35,002
to act as the infinity stone.

745
00:14:35,002 --> 00:14:36,335
Three, two, one.

746
00:14:37,456 --> 00:14:38,602
(screams)

747
00:14:38,602 --> 00:14:39,538
Look at that bro!

748
00:14:39,538 --> 00:14:40,996
So here we go, just place it in the palm of my hand.

749
00:14:40,996 --> 00:14:42,031
- [Devin] Yeah, go, go, go.

750
00:14:42,031 --> 00:14:42,864
- Yes dude. Okay.

751
00:14:42,864 --> 00:14:43,697
Fist bump, Devin.

752
00:14:43,697 --> 00:14:44,758
- [Devin] Wait, wait, no, no, no.

753
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:45,591
- Fist bump.

754
00:14:45,591 --> 00:14:46,424
- [Devin] Your aim is terrible.

755
00:14:46,424 --> 00:14:47,293
- [Collins] But my fist bumps are great!

756
00:14:47,293 --> 00:14:51,360
- [Both] Three, two, one. No! (explosion)

757
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,157
- [Collins] To get Devin back, it's very easy.

758
00:14:53,157 --> 00:14:54,506
So here's how this works.

759
00:14:54,506 --> 00:14:55,721
I'm just gonna twist the space stone.

760
00:14:55,721 --> 00:14:57,071
It'll make a portal right here and Devin will appear.

761
00:14:57,071 --> 00:14:59,425
So here we are. Three, two, one.

762
00:14:59,425 --> 00:15:00,258
(grunts)

763
00:15:00,258 --> 00:15:01,139
Yo!

764
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:03,020
- [Devin] You couldn't have made that wider dude?

765
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,835
- I'm sorry bro. It's a space stone. Okay?

766
00:15:04,835 --> 00:15:06,443
- [Devin] The things you do to me on this channel!

767
00:15:06,443 --> 00:15:07,866
- At least you get to see mayo man, right?

768
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:09,383
- [Devin] I went to like 5 different dimensions.

769
00:15:09,383 --> 00:15:11,209
All right, it's out and there you go!

770
00:15:11,209 --> 00:15:12,856
- [Collins] Wait, so that's gonna be your infinity stones?

771
00:15:12,856 --> 00:15:14,035
- Yeah and you know what's next?

772
00:15:14,035 --> 00:15:14,868
Liquid nitrogen.

773
00:15:14,868 --> 00:15:15,701
- [Collins] Whoa!

774
00:15:15,701 --> 00:15:17,318
- [Devin] All right! Time for some liquid nitrogen.

775
00:15:17,318 --> 00:15:18,903
Okay, pour it right on top!

776
00:15:18,903 --> 00:15:21,185
- [Collins] Like a direct pour on top?

777
00:15:21,185 --> 00:15:22,018
Wait, why you blowing on it?

778
00:15:22,018 --> 00:15:22,851
- [Devin] Cause it's so cool

779
00:15:22,851 --> 00:15:24,856
Cause it's a lot of suds.

780
00:15:24,856 --> 00:15:26,026
- [Devin] Three!

781
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:26,859
- Holy Cow!

782
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:27,692
- [Devin] Two.

783
00:15:27,692 --> 00:15:28,525
One.

784
00:15:28,525 --> 00:15:29,358
- Have you started yet?

785
00:15:29,358 --> 00:15:30,274
- [Devin] Now I have. Now I have.

786
00:15:30,274 --> 00:15:31,153
- Oh! It's like a cloud but yet

787
00:15:31,153 --> 00:15:32,065
it's liquid at the same time.

788
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:32,898
- [Devin] Wow.

789
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:33,737
- It's so tough to tell where the liquid is.

790
00:15:33,737 --> 00:15:35,328
- [Devin] Definitely do not try this at home.

791
00:15:35,328 --> 00:15:37,075
All right, now it's time to break it up

792
00:15:37,075 --> 00:15:37,908
into the infinity stones.

793
00:15:37,908 --> 00:15:39,064
- [Collins] Oh Man! Here we go.

794
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:39,897
- [Both] Three.

795
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:40,730
Two.

796
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:41,563
- [Collins] Oh! I just had an idea.

797
00:15:41,563 --> 00:15:42,396
What if you pick it up and then you just smash it?

798
00:15:42,396 --> 00:15:43,229
- Oh, yes!

799
00:15:43,229 --> 00:15:44,062
- [Collins] All right let's see this.

800
00:15:44,062 --> 00:15:44,895
- [Devin] Trying to pick it up with these massive gloves.

801
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,736
- I wonder if it's gonna break or not.

802
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:46,569
Do you need help? Kinda like--

803
00:15:46,569 --> 00:15:47,739
- [Devin] I think I got it. I got it. I got it.

804
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:48,572
Ready here we go.

805
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:49,405
- [Both] Three.

806
00:15:49,405 --> 00:15:50,238
Two.

807
00:15:50,238 --> 00:15:51,071
One.

808
00:15:51,071 --> 00:15:51,904
Oh!

809
00:15:53,805 --> 00:15:56,365
(slow motion roar)

810
00:15:56,365 --> 00:15:58,347
- [Devin] I think this kinda beat yours already man.

811
00:15:58,347 --> 00:15:59,405
- [Collins] I don't know!

812
00:15:59,405 --> 00:16:00,809
- [Devin] My infinity gauntlet

813
00:16:00,809 --> 00:16:02,293
I've got the silicon mold right here.

814
00:16:02,293 --> 00:16:03,806
I'm gonna dust it with 24k gold.

815
00:16:03,806 --> 00:16:05,525
Oh, look at this. It's a gold peach.

816
00:16:05,525 --> 00:16:07,064
- [Collins] You're gonna take a dusted peach

817
00:16:07,064 --> 00:16:08,179
and peach fuzz all over it

818
00:16:08,179 --> 00:16:09,012
- Exactly

819
00:16:09,012 --> 00:16:09,845
- [Collins] and place it in there.

820
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:10,923
Maybe you can use some of your chin peach fuzz.

821
00:16:10,923 --> 00:16:11,756
- That's not there.

822
00:16:11,756 --> 00:16:13,535
- [Collins] I can grow a full beard if I wanted to.

823
00:16:13,535 --> 00:16:14,785
Check this out!

824
00:16:15,823 --> 00:16:16,656
- [Devin] Wow.

825
00:16:16,656 --> 00:16:18,102
- Yeah, I gotta go shave.

826
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,588
- [Devin] All right this peach is good and all

827
00:16:19,588 --> 00:16:21,297
but I'm actually gonna use this feather duster here.

828
00:16:21,297 --> 00:16:23,878
Nothing like 24k gold just flying everywhere.

829
00:16:23,878 --> 00:16:24,971
- It looks like dirt.

830
00:16:24,971 --> 00:16:26,628
Got some blueberries right here.

831
00:16:26,628 --> 00:16:27,843
I'm going to be straining these

832
00:16:27,843 --> 00:16:29,349
into a beautiful, pulpy muusche.

833
00:16:29,349 --> 00:16:30,626
- [Collins] We're gonna take this right now.

834
00:16:30,626 --> 00:16:32,003
We're gonna dump all my blueberries on the inside.

835
00:16:32,003 --> 00:16:32,836
- [Devin] You need some --

836
00:16:32,836 --> 00:16:33,909
- [Collins] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

837
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:34,882
- Some feather dusting. You need some feather dusting.

838
00:16:34,882 --> 00:16:36,125
- [Collins] I feel like I'm in the matrix.

839
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:37,293
- You don't want 24k gold in yours?

840
00:16:37,293 --> 00:16:38,126
- [Collins] I do not.

841
00:16:38,126 --> 00:16:39,227
Ah, the blueberries are going everywhere.

842
00:16:39,227 --> 00:16:40,083
the blueberries are going everywhere.

843
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:40,916
Okay there we go.

844
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,458
And now my favorite part. Time to secure the bag.

845
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:44,428
(comedic drum)

846
00:16:44,428 --> 00:16:45,261
Get it, because if it was money?

847
00:16:45,261 --> 00:16:46,094
- [Collins] Three.

848
00:16:46,094 --> 00:16:46,927
Two.

849
00:16:46,927 --> 00:16:47,760
One.

850
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,746
Just a (mumbles)

851
00:16:48,746 --> 00:16:49,683
a little squeeze like this.

852
00:16:49,683 --> 00:16:50,516
(screams)

853
00:16:50,516 --> 00:16:51,372
- [Collins] Oh! Look at it.

854
00:16:51,372 --> 00:16:52,356
Oh! Oh man. Here we go. Look at that.

855
00:16:52,356 --> 00:16:53,534
Oh, you see it coming through.

856
00:16:53,534 --> 00:16:54,819
- [Devin] Look at this. This is just amazing.

857
00:16:54,819 --> 00:16:55,652
(screams)

858
00:16:55,652 --> 00:16:56,485
- [Collins] Ruined it!

859
00:16:56,485 --> 00:16:57,357
Man, another bag.

860
00:16:57,357 --> 00:17:00,031
- Hey I got another bag too but it's actually secure.

861
00:17:00,031 --> 00:17:01,372
- [Collins] Is this for muffins?

862
00:17:01,372 --> 00:17:03,090
- Disregard what it says on the bag.

863
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,413
- [Collins] I'd actually really enjoy some muffins.

864
00:17:04,413 --> 00:17:05,246
- I don't know how to make muffins.

865
00:17:05,246 --> 00:17:07,014
- [Collins] I want a muffin! If you can't make me a muffin,

866
00:17:07,014 --> 00:17:08,490
Devin I will turn you into a muffin.

867
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:09,645
All right here we go. Three, two, one. Boom. There we go!

868
00:17:09,645 --> 00:17:11,091
- [Devin] Wait, dude, what? Why am I muffin?

869
00:17:11,091 --> 00:17:12,271
- Because I wanted a muffin Devin.

870
00:17:12,271 --> 00:17:13,432
- [Devin] Am I Gluten free at least?

871
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:14,265
- Yeah I think you're gluten.

872
00:17:14,265 --> 00:17:15,134
You're definitely a gluten free muffin.

873
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:15,967
- [Devin] Yes, yes, thank you!

874
00:17:15,967 --> 00:17:16,800
- [Collins] Devin's a free range muffin.

875
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,445
Range around the store freely.

876
00:17:18,445 --> 00:17:19,278
- Oh yeah.

877
00:17:19,278 --> 00:17:20,506
- [Collins] Look at that juice come out.

878
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:22,232
- [Devin] All right, got some milk now. Time to fill it up.

879
00:17:22,232 --> 00:17:23,503
- Here we go, gonna place some strawberries here

880
00:17:23,503 --> 00:17:24,635
on the inside of my sock.

881
00:17:24,635 --> 00:17:26,175
And this is actually Devin's sock.

882
00:17:26,175 --> 00:17:27,677
Devin only wears yellow socks.

883
00:17:27,677 --> 00:17:29,251
Fun fact that may or may not be true.

884
00:17:29,251 --> 00:17:30,727
- [Collins] Next up, we're gonna take the sock

885
00:17:30,727 --> 00:17:32,301
and do something very gentle with the strawberries.

886
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,134
- Sure.

887
00:17:33,134 --> 00:17:34,464
- [Collins] BAM! Juiced on me.

888
00:17:34,464 --> 00:17:35,596
- O-K, that is terrifying.

889
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:36,858
Oh man, Okay, All right.

890
00:17:36,858 --> 00:17:37,961
I'm getting behind you.

891
00:17:37,961 --> 00:17:39,923
- [Collins] That is how you juice up some strawberries.

892
00:17:39,923 --> 00:17:40,960
- [Devin] Whisking is done.

893
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,463
Now it's time to fill up my mold.

894
00:17:42,463 --> 00:17:43,676
I got it, I got it, Look at that.

895
00:17:43,676 --> 00:17:45,289
All right, I only have to fill up one half

896
00:17:45,289 --> 00:17:46,970
because I'm gonna use some triphical force

897
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:48,058
to fill up the other half.

898
00:17:48,058 --> 00:17:49,372
And I'm using a tri-cycle.

899
00:17:49,372 --> 00:17:50,246
- [Collins] I still think--

900
00:17:50,246 --> 00:17:51,127
A tricycle?

901
00:17:51,127 --> 00:17:51,960
- Yes!

902
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,098
- [Collins] That is one wheel of a tricycle's got 3 wheels.

903
00:17:53,098 --> 00:17:53,931
(buzzer)

904
00:17:53,931 --> 00:17:54,764
- Oh yeah, yeah, a unicycle!

905
00:17:54,764 --> 00:17:55,597
- [Collins] You don't know your basic bike wheels.

906
00:17:55,597 --> 00:17:57,255
Our strawberries is stuck in this middle portion

907
00:17:57,255 --> 00:17:58,629
of the sock. So here we go we're gonna go here

908
00:17:58,629 --> 00:17:59,999
It's gonna get like squeezes around.

909
00:17:59,999 --> 00:18:01,223
- [Devin] I'm gonna use some triphical force to coat

910
00:18:01,223 --> 00:18:02,743
the inside of the mold.

911
00:18:02,743 --> 00:18:04,569
- [Collins] But first Devin, you must ride it

912
00:18:04,569 --> 00:18:06,252
to show that you are worthy of using a unicycle.

913
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:07,225
- Here we go!

914
00:18:07,225 --> 00:18:08,951
- [Collins] Do you even know how to ride a unicycle?

915
00:18:08,951 --> 00:18:09,784
- I do not! I got it!

916
00:18:09,784 --> 00:18:10,617
- [Collins] You got it?

917
00:18:10,617 --> 00:18:11,877
You're like slipping backwards though.

918
00:18:11,877 --> 00:18:13,942
- I'm riding it! Look at this. Amazingness.

919
00:18:13,942 --> 00:18:15,579
- [Collins] I gotta say don't try this at-

920
00:18:15,579 --> 00:18:16,412
(shrieks)

921
00:18:16,412 --> 00:18:18,405
- [Devin] No hands. No hands. Wow.

922
00:18:18,405 --> 00:18:20,440
- Holy Cow! He's riding it. Okay that's enough.

923
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,833
Devin that is enough. Holy Cow!

924
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:22,666
- I did it! I did it! All right!

925
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:24,190
- Devin just rode a unicycle for the first time!

926
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:25,063
- I learned it.

927
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:27,287
Now I just have to attach this to the unicycle pedal.

928
00:18:27,287 --> 00:18:29,001
- With a carrot. - Not with a carrot.

929
00:18:29,001 --> 00:18:30,364
- You sure? - Put the carrots away.

930
00:18:30,364 --> 00:18:31,894
- I will not. - You don't need them.

931
00:18:31,894 --> 00:18:34,896
(action noises)

932
00:18:34,896 --> 00:18:36,770
- Not only does he do all of his own stunts,

933
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:37,906
he does his own sound effects.

934
00:18:37,906 --> 00:18:38,739
- Yeet.

935
00:18:38,739 --> 00:18:40,704
- Gotta put it up like this here, looks like this.

936
00:18:40,704 --> 00:18:42,152
- Your unicycle in my face, Devin.

937
00:18:42,152 --> 00:18:43,169
- And then, oh, oh, oh, oh.

938
00:18:43,169 --> 00:18:44,002
- Yoooooo!

939
00:18:44,002 --> 00:18:44,835
- Here we go! - That is crazy!

940
00:18:44,835 --> 00:18:47,121
- And now it's going to coat every side of the mold.

941
00:18:47,121 --> 00:18:48,640
- Time for me to construct the infinity gauntlet

942
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,473
around my hand.

943
00:18:49,473 --> 00:18:50,306
- Whoa.

944
00:18:50,306 --> 00:18:51,331
- We gotta knead the dough.

945
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:52,682
- I'm making some edible accents for my gauntlet.

946
00:18:52,682 --> 00:18:53,515
Pouring the water in.

947
00:18:53,515 --> 00:18:54,921
Then I have to whisk it super, super quick.

948
00:18:54,921 --> 00:18:56,006
I gotta get it out! I gotta get it out!

949
00:18:56,006 --> 00:18:57,826
- Wait its gonna fall out the bottom though

950
00:18:57,826 --> 00:18:58,659
- Look, look.

951
00:18:58,659 --> 00:18:59,950
- Wait so it's going to turn into noodles then or what?

952
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:00,783
- Moment of truth.

953
00:19:00,783 --> 00:19:01,616
- Go for it.

954
00:19:01,616 --> 00:19:02,449
- And now you just go right in!

955
00:19:02,449 --> 00:19:03,282
- Oh! Yo!

956
00:19:03,282 --> 00:19:04,440
- Oh! Yes!

957
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,132
- I gotta mold this thing around my hand.

958
00:19:06,132 --> 00:19:07,553
There's a lot of finishing touches we gotta do,

959
00:19:07,553 --> 00:19:08,751
to compile our gloves, put them together but.

960
00:19:08,751 --> 00:19:09,584
- Look at these noodles.

961
00:19:09,584 --> 00:19:11,145
- That's gonna be incredible.

962
00:19:11,145 --> 00:19:13,304
So right now let's finish making the gloves.

963
00:19:13,304 --> 00:19:14,716
We got the finished gauntlets

964
00:19:14,716 --> 00:19:15,549
- Yep.

965
00:19:15,549 --> 00:19:16,382
- and these things look so crazy.

966
00:19:16,382 --> 00:19:17,215
Here we go.

967
00:19:17,215 --> 00:19:18,138
- Three, two, oh wait.

968
00:19:18,138 --> 00:19:18,971
- Five second subscribe challenge.

969
00:19:18,971 --> 00:19:20,546
We want to see if you can subscribe to this channel

970
00:19:20,546 --> 00:19:23,148
and turn on the channel post notifications in five seconds,

971

you ready? Here we go.

972
00:19:24,033 --> 00:19:27,033
- Five, four, three, two, one, done.

973
00:19:28,862 --> 00:19:30,386
- If you could do that comment down below Keyper Squad

974
00:19:30,386 --> 00:19:31,219
right now.

975
00:19:31,219 --> 00:19:32,640
- Three, two, one, ta-dah!

976
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,913
- [Devin] Yes.

977
00:19:33,913 --> 00:19:35,864
- [Collins] Look at how incredible these turned out.

978
00:19:35,864 --> 00:19:36,978
- These are insane.

979
00:19:36,978 --> 00:19:39,382
- Man it took so much work off camera.

980
00:19:39,382 --> 00:19:40,551
You get to comment down below

981
00:19:40,551 --> 00:19:41,384
whose edible gauntlet looks the best.

982
00:19:41,384 --> 00:19:42,719
We'll be trying them at the end of the video.

983
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:44,265
We've got our edible Green Goblin gadgets

984
00:19:44,265 --> 00:19:45,978
and I cannot wait to take these things

985
00:19:45,978 --> 00:19:47,505
an smash them and break them, see what happens.

986
00:19:47,505 --> 00:19:48,338
- Oh yes.

987
00:19:48,338 --> 00:19:49,432
- But first we need to taste them delicately

988
00:19:49,432 --> 00:19:50,469
to find out which one we like more.

989
00:19:50,469 --> 00:19:51,302
We'll start off with yours.

990
00:19:51,302 --> 00:19:52,135
- All right.

991
00:19:52,135 --> 00:19:53,373
(grunts) - [Collins] It's dangling.

992
00:19:53,373 --> 00:19:55,163
- I'm honestly not excited for this.

993
00:19:55,163 --> 00:19:56,663
- Three, two, one.

994
00:20:00,028 --> 00:20:02,705
(laughing) - Not weird.

995
00:20:02,705 --> 00:20:04,010
- Woo! - Oh ho ho.

996
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:05,712
- Now it's time for mine so boom.

997
00:20:05,712 --> 00:20:06,682
- Oh, geez.

998
00:20:06,682 --> 00:20:08,745
- Now it's time to find out how this tastes.

999
00:20:08,745 --> 00:20:09,860
Boom, here's my spoonful.

1000
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,203
- I'm just gonna dig around in here.

1001
00:20:11,203 --> 00:20:12,703
- Three, two, one.

1002
00:20:14,665 --> 00:20:15,919
- Woo!

1003
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:16,752
- Dude!

1004
00:20:16,752 --> 00:20:18,571
- Oh, oh, oh. (smack)

1005
00:20:18,571 --> 00:20:19,404
- Good job.

1006
00:20:19,404 --> 00:20:20,274
(smack) - Oh

1007
00:20:20,274 --> 00:20:22,073
(smack) - Oh

1008
00:20:22,073 --> 00:20:24,187
(smack) - Oh, ow!

1009
00:20:24,187 --> 00:20:25,626
(sad music)

1010
00:20:25,626 --> 00:20:26,459
- Good job.

1011
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:27,292
- Probably one of the best tasting things we've made

1012
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:28,125
in a very long time.

1013
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:29,205
- You made it.

1014
00:20:29,205 --> 00:20:30,038
- You get to comment down below

1015
00:20:30,038 --> 00:20:31,153
which one is gonna look cooler when we smash it

1016
00:20:31,153 --> 00:20:31,986
on the ground.

1017
00:20:31,986 --> 00:20:32,819
We got our edible infinity gauntlets

1018
00:20:32,819 --> 00:20:34,333
and now it's time to see which one tastes better.

1019
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,753
I think we'll go for yours first.

1020
00:20:35,753 --> 00:20:37,610
How would you recommend going about eating yours?

1021
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:39,833
- I think I should pull off some of the fingers here.

1022
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:41,036
I'm going for the red stone.

1023
00:20:41,036 --> 00:20:42,781
- I'll take as many of the stones as I possibly can.

1024
00:20:42,781 --> 00:20:44,033
- Here we go, infinity knuckles.

1025
00:20:44,033 --> 00:20:45,077
- Oh wait, perfect, here we go.

1026
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,494
- Three, two one.

1027
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,605
- Whoa, woo

1028
00:20:48,605 --> 00:20:50,538
(gun noises)

1029
00:20:50,538 --> 00:20:52,773
- Whoa, Dude, these are like solid on the outside

1030
00:20:52,773 --> 00:20:54,782
and nice and creamy on the inside.

1031
00:20:54,782 --> 00:20:56,670
- Wow. So good.

1032
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:57,534
- Very nice.

1033
00:20:57,534 --> 00:20:58,679
- I don't know if mines gonna be able to live up to that.

1034
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:00,173
I'll take the ring finger here, oh look at it.

1035
00:21:00,173 --> 00:21:01,198
- [Devin] I'll take a nice pinky.

1036
00:21:01,198 --> 00:21:02,090
- Three, two, one.

1037
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:04,618
(grunting)

1038
00:21:04,618 --> 00:21:06,443
- Wow, that is crunchy.

1039
00:21:06,443 --> 00:21:07,977
Very unpleasant experience.

1040
00:21:07,977 --> 00:21:09,973
- Yeah I gotta say the stone combined with the cucumber

1041
00:21:09,973 --> 00:21:10,806
was definitely very bizarre.

1042
00:21:10,806 --> 00:21:11,639
- Yes.

1043
00:21:11,639 --> 00:21:13,364
- But you get to comment down below

1044
00:21:13,364 --> 00:21:14,434
which one would you like to eat if you had the choice

1045
00:21:14,434 --> 00:21:15,731
and right now, we're onto the next one.

1046
00:21:15,731 --> 00:21:16,981
Got the edible Captain America shield,

1047
00:21:16,981 --> 00:21:18,850
which one do you think is gonna taste better?

1048
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:20,274
- I think mine will, I think it's more unique.

1049
00:21:20,274 --> 00:21:22,111
Let's taste yours first then we can taste mine.

1050
00:21:22,111 --> 00:21:23,763
- Which part of it do you want to eat first?

1051
00:21:23,763 --> 00:21:26,171
- I wanna eat the star and the outer edge.

1052
00:21:26,171 --> 00:21:27,698
- [Collins] That's your piece of the star.

1053
00:21:27,698 --> 00:21:28,531
- Thank you, appreciate it.

1054
00:21:28,531 --> 00:21:29,367
- Three, two, one.

1055
00:21:29,367 --> 00:21:31,506
(grunting)

1056
00:21:31,506 --> 00:21:33,212
- The star is so brittle.

1057
00:21:33,212 --> 00:21:34,884
- Despite the burnt-ness.

1058
00:21:34,884 --> 00:21:36,257
- It's actually quite tasty.

1059
00:21:36,257 --> 00:21:38,426
Now it's time to try mine after that catastrophe.

1060
00:21:38,426 --> 00:21:39,720
- Catastrophe? - Yes.

1061
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,666
- I mean hey it was like decent.

1062
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:43,524
How are we going about eating yours, Devin?

1063
00:21:43,524 --> 00:21:44,357
- With the chisel.

1064
00:21:44,357 --> 00:21:46,011
This is for you, be very careful.

1065
00:21:46,011 --> 00:21:48,176
- This just looks like a chunk of ice.

1066
00:21:48,176 --> 00:21:50,227
- Gotta get some of this cardboard stuff under here

1067
00:21:50,227 --> 00:21:51,060
and there you go.

1068
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,710
- Oh man, I don't want to eat some of the cardboard.

1069
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:53,543
- Get a nice chunk.

1070
00:21:53,543 --> 00:21:54,376
- Three, two, one.

1071
00:21:54,376 --> 00:21:55,747
(grunting)

1072
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:56,580
- Talk about crunchy.

1073
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,909
(coughing)

1074
00:21:57,909 --> 00:21:59,332
This paper stuff tastes terrible.

1075
00:21:59,332 --> 00:22:00,356
- It tasted just like cardboard so.

1076
00:22:00,356 --> 00:22:02,128
- [Devin] Yeah neither of these were really a home run.

1077
00:22:02,128 --> 00:22:03,208
- You get to comment down below

1078
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:04,136
which one do you think will be able to withstand a punch

1079
00:22:04,136 --> 00:22:06,188
and right now we're onto the next one.

1080
00:22:06,188 --> 00:22:08,272
- We've got the giant edible Green Goblin gadgets

1081
00:22:08,272 --> 00:22:09,309
- Yep (laughing)

1082
00:22:09,309 --> 00:22:10,508
and now it's time to throw these things down

1083
00:22:10,508 --> 00:22:12,028
on the bullseye.

1084
00:22:12,028 --> 00:22:13,518
We're looking for the biggest explosion possible.

1085
00:22:13,518 --> 00:22:14,935
Which one should we test out first?

1086
00:22:14,935 --> 00:22:16,673
- I think we should test out yours first.

1087
00:22:16,673 --> 00:22:19,017
- Devin how about you hop down there right now,

1088
00:22:19,017 --> 00:22:20,101
I'm gonna prepare it, the toss (laughing) this is heavy.

1089
00:22:20,101 --> 00:22:21,153
- That's a weak toss dude,

1090
00:22:21,153 --> 00:22:22,288
last time you chucked it really hard.

1091
00:22:22,288 --> 00:22:23,799
- Excuse me I'm preparing, go downstairs.

1092
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:25,947
- All right, all right, sure.

1093
00:22:25,947 --> 00:22:26,780
- Prepare to give this thing a big drop.

1094
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,098
- Power stance, right just power stance and then drop it.

1095
00:22:28,098 --> 00:22:29,567
- Yes, exactly, you're good at the power stance.

1096
00:22:29,567 --> 00:22:30,400
- On a scale from one to 10,

1097
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,616
how big do you think the impact is going to be?

1098
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:33,778
- Oh geez, I think probably a solid seven.

1099
00:22:33,778 --> 00:22:35,687
Mine's going to be way bigger let's face it.

1100
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,264
- Yeah but see the thing is Devin,

1101
00:22:37,264 --> 00:22:38,097
bigger isn't always better.

1102
00:22:38,097 --> 00:22:39,829
Sometimes good things come in small packages.

1103
00:22:39,829 --> 00:22:40,662
- Whoa.

1104
00:22:40,662 --> 00:22:41,626
- In this case, Green Goblin gadget.

1105
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:42,459
- Here we go.

1106
00:22:42,459 --> 00:22:43,417
- Three, two, one.

1107
00:22:43,417 --> 00:22:44,562
(yelling)

1108
00:22:44,562 --> 00:22:46,387
- [Devin] Oh my gosh.

1109
00:22:46,387 --> 00:22:47,834
- [Collins] What did I tell you dude?

1110
00:22:47,834 --> 00:22:49,682
Holy cow, I think that was a 10 bro.

1111
00:22:49,682 --> 00:22:52,586
- I don't know, yours is so gelatinous,

1112
00:22:52,586 --> 00:22:53,969
mine's gonna splatter everywhere.

1113
00:22:53,969 --> 00:22:55,740
- I don't know man, so you ready to challenge mine?

1114
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,909
- Yeah, I guess we'll find out.

1115
00:22:56,909 --> 00:22:58,060
- All right let's switch spots.

1116
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,584
- Got my pumpkin Green Goblin gadget

1117
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,858
and I'm ready to do the drop dude.

1118
00:23:00,858 --> 00:23:02,121
- I don't think you are Devin,

1119
00:23:02,121 --> 00:23:03,686
I don't think you understand what it takes

1120
00:23:03,686 --> 00:23:05,067
to smash the pumpkin.

1121
00:23:05,067 --> 00:23:07,081
- What do you mean? Mine's going to go everywhere.

1122
00:23:07,081 --> 00:23:08,049
It's got the dry ice frozen yogurt.

1123
00:23:08,049 --> 00:23:09,667
- But what you're forgetting is you have a balloon inside

1124
00:23:09,667 --> 00:23:10,889
of your pumpkin.

1125
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,853
Balloons ae soft, they float,

1126
00:23:12,853 --> 00:23:15,123
it's not gonna hit the ground with any force.

1127
00:23:15,123 --> 00:23:17,172
- It's getting dark and mine has glow in the dark slime so.

1128
00:23:17,172 --> 00:23:18,602
- Yeah that is kinda cool actually.

1129
00:23:18,602 --> 00:23:20,713
- Yeah but on a scale of one to 10,

1130
00:23:20,713 --> 00:23:22,009
how far do you think its gonna go?

1131
00:23:22,009 --> 00:23:23,609
- I don't know, I feel like it's either gonna be like a two

1132
00:23:23,609 --> 00:23:24,442
or an 11.

1133
00:23:24,442 --> 00:23:25,275
- What?

1134
00:23:25,275 --> 00:23:26,794
- I don't know it's either gonna go everywhere

1135
00:23:26,794 --> 00:23:27,983
or it's just gonna hit and not do anything.

1136
00:23:27,983 --> 00:23:28,989
- How does a two even make it in there.

1137
00:23:28,989 --> 00:23:30,088
- I just don't know if it's gonna be-

1138
00:23:30,088 --> 00:23:31,589
- It's gonna be 11 for sure, you ready for this?

1139
00:23:31,589 --> 00:23:32,896
- I don't know if you have the ability to

1140
00:23:32,896 --> 00:23:33,998
smash the pumpkin, that's all I'm saying.

1141
00:23:33,998 --> 00:23:34,831
(laughing)

1142
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:35,801
- So you're stound to my ability?

1143
00:23:35,801 --> 00:23:36,748
- I mean slightly. - Here we go.

1144
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:37,917
- Three, two, wait.

1145
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:39,698
- If you want to win a 15 minute video call with Devin and I

1146
00:23:39,698 --> 00:23:41,823
text the word super to 81800 right now,

1147
00:23:41,823 --> 00:23:44,320
so pause the video, text the word super to 81800,

1148
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,134
you'll automatically be entered in to win.

1149
00:23:46,134 --> 00:23:46,967
And let's see how this goes.

1150
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:47,800
- Get back for this.

1151
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,670
- Three, two, one.

1152
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:49,962
- Oh man, go for it.

1153
00:23:49,962 --> 00:23:51,773
(screaming) (laughing)

1154
00:23:51,773 --> 00:23:52,624
- Yes.

1155
00:23:52,624 --> 00:23:53,497
- [Collins] Oh my gosh.

1156
00:23:53,497 --> 00:23:56,186
- That is a Green Goblin gadget right there.

1157
00:23:56,186 --> 00:23:57,893
- You know what, I gotta give a round of applause for that,

1158
00:23:57,893 --> 00:23:59,773
I did not expect it to go that big bro,

1159
00:23:59,773 --> 00:24:01,014
