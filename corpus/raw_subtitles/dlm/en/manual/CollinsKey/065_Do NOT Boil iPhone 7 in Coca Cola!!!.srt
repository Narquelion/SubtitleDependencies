1
00:00:00,186 --> 00:00:01,361
- What's up, it's Collins Key

2
00:00:01,361 --> 00:00:02,953
and for today's video I'm doing something

3
00:00:02,953 --> 00:00:04,532
no one should ever do.

4
00:00:04,532 --> 00:00:06,676
I'm gonna be boiling a brand new

5
00:00:06,676 --> 00:00:08,899
iPhone Seven in Coca-Cola.

6
00:00:08,899 --> 00:00:10,092
Now, the reason I'm doing this is

7
00:00:10,092 --> 00:00:11,526
because I want to test once and for all

8
00:00:11,526 --> 00:00:12,729
Number one, is this phone really

9
00:00:12,729 --> 00:00:14,332
water resistant?

10
00:00:14,332 --> 00:00:15,581
Is it Coca-Cola resistant?

11
00:00:15,581 --> 00:00:18,045
And is it boiling Coca-Cola resistant?

12
00:00:18,045 --> 00:00:19,084
I'm really excited because I'm giving away

13
00:00:19,084 --> 00:00:21,364
an iPhone Seven right now on my Instagram

14
00:00:21,364 --> 00:00:23,429
so if you want to win it all you have to do is

15
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:24,262
follow me on Instagram,

16
00:00:24,262 --> 00:00:26,443
turn on my Instagram post notifications,

17
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:27,355
and be active.

18
00:00:27,355 --> 00:00:28,907
The rest of the rules are down

19
00:00:28,907 --> 00:00:29,740
in the description below.

20
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:30,573
I'm also giving away

21
00:00:30,573 --> 00:00:32,930
a drone on YouTube, a GoPro on Twitter,

22
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:34,056
all the rules for those giveaways

23
00:00:34,056 --> 00:00:35,389
are down in the description below.

24
00:00:35,389 --> 00:00:37,191
And if you want me to boil even more things

25
00:00:37,191 --> 00:00:38,732
in the future, give this video a big thumbs up

26
00:00:38,732 --> 00:00:40,260
and if this video gets enough thumbs up,

27
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,106
then I will do some crazy videos coming up,

28
00:00:42,106 --> 00:00:44,286
and comment down below what should I boil

29
00:00:44,286 --> 00:00:45,521
in a future video.

30
00:00:45,521 --> 00:00:47,691
And also this video is inspired by Guava Juice

31
00:00:47,691 --> 00:00:49,633
who boils a whole bunch of crazy toys all the time.

32
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:50,688
I'm going to put a link to his video

33
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,833
down in the description below,

34
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:53,061
so be sure to go check that out.

35
00:00:53,061 --> 00:00:55,972
But right now, it's time to unbox this iPhone Seven.

36
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:59,334
So, first things first we don't need this bag.

37
00:00:59,334 --> 00:01:00,167
Yeet.

38
00:01:00,167 --> 00:01:01,000
Alright, so let's open this thing up.

39
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,476
So, first things first you pull of this here.

40
00:01:02,476 --> 00:01:04,756
Yup. Oh, it's nice.

41
00:01:04,756 --> 00:01:05,589
Alright, here we go.

42
00:01:05,589 --> 00:01:06,954
The moment of truth.

43
00:01:06,954 --> 00:01:08,208
Oh! No!

44
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:09,515
That was not good right there.

45
00:01:09,515 --> 00:01:11,383
So, we're going to remove the protective plastic.

46
00:01:11,383 --> 00:01:12,216
Alright, here we go.

47
00:01:12,216 --> 00:01:13,049
So we're turning it on right now.

48
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:13,882
Wanna make sure you guys can see.

49
00:01:13,882 --> 00:01:15,616
This is a real working iPhone.

50
00:01:15,616 --> 00:01:16,863
Now, it's the very important part

51
00:01:16,863 --> 00:01:18,227
where we get to set up the passcode

52
00:01:18,227 --> 00:01:19,060
on the phone.

53
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,264
So this is a very difficult passcode,

54
00:01:20,264 --> 00:01:21,576
no one will ever break this.

55
00:01:21,576 --> 00:01:23,493
(taps)

56
00:01:24,954 --> 00:01:27,474
Apparently, Apple suggests you do not even

57
00:01:27,474 --> 00:01:28,531
use this passcode.

58
00:01:28,531 --> 00:01:29,805
Good to go.

59
00:01:29,805 --> 00:01:31,055
Nope, we have absent data.

60
00:01:31,055 --> 00:01:32,777
Man, this takes quite a while to set up.

61
00:01:32,777 --> 00:01:34,474
Let me go through this, and then once

62
00:01:34,474 --> 00:01:35,307
I've got the whole phone set up

63
00:01:35,307 --> 00:01:36,603
then we'll go to the next part.

64
00:01:36,603 --> 00:01:38,591
There's one more setting I'm going to enable right now,

65
00:01:38,591 --> 00:01:40,423
and that is send diagnostics to Apple

66
00:01:40,423 --> 00:01:41,866
whenever this phone crashes.

67
00:01:41,866 --> 00:01:43,423
And then Apple will do the whole data report

68
00:01:43,423 --> 00:01:44,974
trying to figure out how it crashed, so.

69
00:01:44,974 --> 00:01:46,015
I'm going to see what Apple has to say

70
00:01:46,015 --> 00:01:48,478
about boiling Coke being the reason this phone crashed.

71
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:50,582
So the phone, as you guys can see, is fully working.

72
00:01:50,582 --> 00:01:51,828
Oh, I have a free text message!

73
00:01:51,828 --> 00:01:52,669
Oh, another text.

74
00:01:52,669 --> 00:01:53,583
Wow, I'm getting a lot of text messages.

75
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:54,947
Can't let you guys see these private text messages

76
00:01:54,947 --> 00:01:57,023
I'm receiving on my brand new phone.

77
00:01:57,023 --> 00:01:57,856
I don't even know how that happens,

78
00:01:57,856 --> 00:01:58,689
how is this working?

79
00:01:58,689 --> 00:02:00,198
So, as you guys can see, the camera works,

80
00:02:00,198 --> 00:02:01,031
let's take a couple of pictures.

81
00:02:01,031 --> 00:02:01,864
Ayyy!

82
00:02:01,864 --> 00:02:02,697
Ohhh!

83
00:02:02,697 --> 00:02:03,530
Snap!

84
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:04,363
Selfie, ayy!

85
00:02:04,363 --> 00:02:06,558
Yo, this camera quality is awesome!

86
00:02:06,558 --> 00:02:08,215
So, as you guys can see this is a fully working.

87
00:02:08,215 --> 00:02:09,475
Oh, how does it work?

88
00:02:09,475 --> 00:02:11,021
Wait, wait, no, back, whoa!

89
00:02:11,021 --> 00:02:11,854
What the heck?

90
00:02:11,854 --> 00:02:12,687
No, no, no, no.

91
00:02:12,687 --> 00:02:13,520
Okay.

92
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,353
So, what's gonna happen right now,

93
00:02:14,353 --> 00:02:15,816
I think next we're going to boil the Coca-Cola,

94
00:02:15,816 --> 00:02:17,671
and then stick this beauty inside.

95
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:20,350
It's so beautiful and so clean, so pristine right now,

96
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,805
and it's about to get bad.

97
00:02:22,805 --> 00:02:23,638
So, here we go.

98
00:02:23,638 --> 00:02:24,471
We've got all the Coca-Cola.

99
00:02:24,471 --> 00:02:25,950
We're going to be adding it into this

100
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:26,783
clear pot right here, because I want to make sure

101
00:02:26,783 --> 00:02:28,653
you guys can see exactly what's happening

102
00:02:28,653 --> 00:02:30,252
at all times during this.

103
00:02:30,252 --> 00:02:32,272
Know what I mean?

104
00:02:32,272 --> 00:02:33,605
Gonna put it on.

105
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,416
There we go!

106
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,632
So, I just kinda shook that one up a little bit

107
00:02:37,632 --> 00:02:39,214
so I'm gonna start with one of these here.

108
00:02:39,214 --> 00:02:40,598
Hopefully it doesn't explode everywhere.

109
00:02:40,598 --> 00:02:41,431
(explosion)

110
00:02:41,431 --> 00:02:42,264
(cracks)

111
00:02:42,264 --> 00:02:43,688
Okay, we're off to a good start.

112
00:02:43,688 --> 00:02:44,664
Let's see.

113
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,164
Gonna add this in.

114
00:02:48,264 --> 00:02:49,873
I don't know what's supposed to happen, either.

115
00:02:49,873 --> 00:02:52,449
So this is going to be a learning experience for all of us.

116
00:02:52,449 --> 00:02:53,815
(fizzes)

117
00:02:53,815 --> 00:02:55,914
So far it seems like, pretty normal.

118
00:02:55,914 --> 00:02:58,327
Like, nothing's really crazy happening.

119
00:02:58,327 --> 00:03:00,004
(foreboding music)

120
00:03:00,004 --> 00:03:02,513
Okay, it's kinda starting to smell a little bit funny now.

121
00:03:02,513 --> 00:03:03,571
Actually, it kinda smells good.

122
00:03:03,571 --> 00:03:04,404
I like the smell of it.

123
00:03:04,404 --> 00:03:06,229
So, at the moment, the smell of it's nice.

124
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:07,547
(foreboding music) (coughs)

125
00:03:07,547 --> 00:03:10,306
Think we should add one more can.

126
00:03:10,306 --> 00:03:11,509
Alright, so that's about halfway filled up.

127
00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:12,584
I don't know what's going to happen.

128
00:03:12,584 --> 00:03:15,224
This stuff could just bubble up and explode.

129
00:03:15,224 --> 00:03:16,119
What is going on!?

130
00:03:16,119 --> 00:03:17,593
- I have no idea what's going to happen.

131
00:03:17,593 --> 00:03:18,864
So, I think that this is good.

132
00:03:18,864 --> 00:03:21,446
Do we just leave it I guess?

133
00:03:21,446 --> 00:03:22,279
Talk to you guys in a little bit.

134
00:03:22,279 --> 00:03:25,333
Talk to you guys in a little bit.

135
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:28,583
(cheerful piano music)

136
00:03:31,107 --> 00:03:31,940
(record scratch)

137
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,632
Alright. Sorry, just checking my temperature

138
00:03:33,632 --> 00:03:35,436
here with my ther, ther, ther.

139
00:03:35,436 --> 00:03:36,269
(beeps)

140
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:37,325
So, I was just informed that it's actually called

141
00:03:37,325 --> 00:03:38,363
a thermometer.

142
00:03:38,363 --> 00:03:39,209
My apologies.

143
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:40,445
So, I'm going to check right now the temperature

144
00:03:40,445 --> 00:03:41,278
of the Coca-Cola.

145
00:03:41,278 --> 00:03:42,196
So, I'm going to turn this on.

146
00:03:42,196 --> 00:03:45,223
Here we go, gonna place it in here.

147
00:03:45,223 --> 00:03:47,124
I think I broke it, 'cause it's no longer working.

148
00:03:47,124 --> 00:03:47,957
Hello?

149
00:03:47,957 --> 00:03:48,790
Oh, okay.

150
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,552
175 degrees.

151
00:03:50,552 --> 00:03:51,498
I probably shouldn't touch it with my tongue.

152
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:52,751
Probably a very bad idea.

153
00:03:52,751 --> 00:03:54,059
So, it's starting to heat up now, I'm going to leave this.

154
00:03:54,059 --> 00:03:56,059
Actually, you know what?

155
00:03:57,135 --> 00:03:57,968
There we go.

156
00:03:57,968 --> 00:03:59,635
Leave that in there.

157
00:04:01,892 --> 00:04:02,725
(beeps)

158
00:04:02,725 --> 00:04:03,558
Tada!

159
00:04:03,558 --> 00:04:04,391
So, right now, as you guys can tell,

160
00:04:04,391 --> 00:04:07,379
there's a very light steam coming off of it.

161
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:08,212
Ow, geez.

162
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,520
Retrieve it, okay.

163
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:15,154
(laughs)

164
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:16,071
We're good.

165
00:04:18,622 --> 00:04:19,669
Alright, so I think I'm going to check the temperature

166
00:04:19,669 --> 00:04:22,412
right now with the charging device for the iPhone,

167
00:04:22,412 --> 00:04:23,892
because I think that's a very accurate way

168
00:04:23,892 --> 00:04:25,642
to see if it's really

169
00:04:26,778 --> 00:04:29,306
if it's really ready.

170
00:04:29,306 --> 00:04:30,139
How many things are on this?

171
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:32,194
So, we'll take the USB end of what's going on.

172
00:04:32,194 --> 00:04:33,466
Oh, yeah, that's testing nicely.

173
00:04:33,466 --> 00:04:35,316
It's a great test we're accomplishing right now.

174
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:36,197
I think it's ready.

175
00:04:36,197 --> 00:04:37,030
(laughs)

176
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:39,415
And from the looks of things

177
00:04:39,415 --> 00:04:40,311
it's not quite there yet.

178
00:04:40,311 --> 00:04:41,354
We're gonna have to wait a little bit longer.

179
00:04:41,354 --> 00:04:44,019
You guys, I learned from my mistakes.

180
00:04:44,019 --> 00:04:44,936
Here we go.

181
00:04:47,716 --> 00:04:48,633
Oh, no, no!

182
00:04:49,751 --> 00:04:50,584
Oh, that's hot!

183
00:04:50,584 --> 00:04:51,417
Hot.

184
00:04:51,417 --> 00:04:52,250
Hot.

185
00:04:54,025 --> 00:04:55,376
Alright, here we go, the moment of truth.

186
00:04:55,376 --> 00:04:57,585
Time to put the brand new iPhone Seven

187
00:04:57,585 --> 00:04:58,725
in the Coca-Cola.

188
00:04:58,725 --> 00:05:00,079
Now, I had to move it over on the burners

189
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:01,156
because this one was just way too small.

190
00:05:01,156 --> 00:05:02,992
This one's making it go a lot quicker.

191
00:05:02,992 --> 00:05:03,825
But, here we go.

192
00:05:03,825 --> 00:05:04,873
I want to show you guys one last time.

193
00:05:04,873 --> 00:05:08,640
Going to put in the super secret passcode.

194
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,473
(dings)

195
00:05:09,473 --> 00:05:10,485
One more time, I'm gonna show you guys.

196
00:05:10,485 --> 00:05:11,475
Actually, oh!

197
00:05:11,475 --> 00:05:12,709
I'm gonna record this whole thing.

198
00:05:12,709 --> 00:05:14,087
Yo, what's up guys! We are about to put

199
00:05:14,087 --> 00:05:16,927
the iPhone Seven in the Coca-Cola.

200
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,642
So, here we go.

201
00:05:18,642 --> 00:05:20,388
Alright, let's see how this works.

202
00:05:20,388 --> 00:05:22,564
Gonna put this in the tongs over here.

203
00:05:22,564 --> 00:05:23,814
Check this out.

204
00:05:24,808 --> 00:05:25,725
Here we go.

205
00:05:28,417 --> 00:05:29,250
Oh!

206
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,263
So I'm just gonna say it right now,

207
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:34,034
I do not think the iPhone is going to survive this at all.

208
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:35,127
Oh my gosh.

209
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:36,720
I wonder if it's still recording at all?

210
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,553
That would be crazy.

211
00:05:37,553 --> 00:05:38,386
I think I put it in wrong.

212
00:05:38,386 --> 00:05:39,247
I think it's recording towards the bottom.

213
00:05:39,247 --> 00:05:40,816
I wanted to record towards the top of the.

214
00:05:40,816 --> 00:05:42,869
If it is recording, it's gonna be.

215
00:05:42,869 --> 00:05:43,996
Let me see really quick.

216
00:05:43,996 --> 00:05:44,829
How do I?

217
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:46,728
Where'd the phone go?

218
00:05:46,728 --> 00:05:48,203
Uh-oh.

219
00:05:48,203 --> 00:05:49,086
It turned off.

220
00:05:49,086 --> 00:05:49,919
That's not a good sign.

221
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:50,784
Alright. We'll turn it up like this.

222
00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:53,411
So, hopefully it's still recording.

223
00:05:53,411 --> 00:05:56,661
(cheerful piano music)

224
00:06:02,671 --> 00:06:04,393
Right now, I'm going to drop everyone's favorite part

225
00:06:04,393 --> 00:06:06,600
of the new iPhone Seven into the Coca-Cola.

226
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,917
And that is the dongle.

227
00:06:08,917 --> 00:06:10,545
Here we go.

228
00:06:10,545 --> 00:06:12,332
Oh, that just splashed on me!

229
00:06:12,332 --> 00:06:13,165
That was hot!

230
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:15,265
As well as the dongle in there, let's just add in

231
00:06:15,265 --> 00:06:17,830
the charging port, let's put in the charging cord

232
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:18,663
a little bit.

233
00:06:18,663 --> 00:06:19,749
And then while we're at it, we might as well add in

234
00:06:19,749 --> 00:06:22,236
these new headphones. Just make sure we get those

235
00:06:22,236 --> 00:06:23,114
all in there.

236
00:06:23,114 --> 00:06:24,494
Give it a nice little mix in there.

237
00:06:24,494 --> 00:06:26,007
Make sure we get all those Apple products

238
00:06:26,007 --> 00:06:28,006
well into the Coca-Cola.

239
00:06:28,006 --> 00:06:29,208
Oh, look, the phone's looking nicely.

240
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,398
Let's kinda flip it over.

241
00:06:30,398 --> 00:06:32,202
It's like we're making an Apple pasta right now.

242
00:06:32,202 --> 00:06:33,114
That makes no sense, but yeah.

243
00:06:33,114 --> 00:06:34,638
It's kinda like Apple pasta at the moment.

244
00:06:34,638 --> 00:06:36,628
It's all browning around it, that's because

245
00:06:36,628 --> 00:06:39,018
the sugar's really helping it all come together

246
00:06:39,018 --> 00:06:39,851
and cook very nicely.

247
00:06:39,851 --> 00:06:41,149
Okay, so this stuff has been boiling in here

248
00:06:41,149 --> 00:06:42,709
for upwards of twenty minutes right now.

249
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:44,007
So, I think it's time to pull it out

250
00:06:44,007 --> 00:06:45,969
and check to see if this phone really works.

251
00:06:45,969 --> 00:06:48,337
We'll have a strainer, I also have a larger pot.

252
00:06:48,337 --> 00:06:49,195
How am I gonna do this?

253
00:06:49,195 --> 00:06:52,040
We're gonna go larger pot right here.

254
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,685
Put on my safety glove.

255
00:06:53,685 --> 00:06:56,272
And let's see what happens.

256
00:06:56,272 --> 00:06:58,155
- [Narrator] Two hours later.

257
00:06:58,155 --> 00:06:58,988
(beeps)

258
00:06:58,988 --> 00:07:00,022
- Yo, Collins, look at this!

259
00:07:00,022 --> 00:07:00,855
Come here!

260
00:07:00,855 --> 00:07:01,688
Dude!

261
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:04,391
Oh, that's hot, that's hot, that's hot, that's hot!

262
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:07,308
(fire alarm beeps)

263
00:07:11,436 --> 00:07:12,269
Oh my gosh.

264
00:07:12,269 --> 00:07:14,161
Alright, guys, I was not happy with how that video ended

265
00:07:14,161 --> 00:07:15,172
and so I've actually taken this home.

266
00:07:15,172 --> 00:07:16,422
I boiled this for two hours.

267
00:07:16,422 --> 00:07:18,376
The iPhone is in here right now.

268
00:07:18,376 --> 00:07:19,458
This thing is just burning.

269
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:20,291
I don't know what's going on.

270
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:22,381
My mom's gonna be so mad, I just ruined her pot.

271
00:07:22,381 --> 00:07:23,973
This is horrible.

272
00:07:23,973 --> 00:07:25,652
What do we do?

273
00:07:25,652 --> 00:07:26,485
I need some tongs.

274
00:07:26,485 --> 00:07:27,340
Oh my god, no!

275
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,173
What?

276
00:07:28,173 --> 00:07:29,006
What is this?

277
00:07:29,006 --> 00:07:29,841
Can I pick it up?

278
00:07:29,841 --> 00:07:30,674
(screaming)

279
00:07:30,674 --> 00:07:31,507
It's hot!

280
00:07:31,507 --> 00:07:33,303
My eyes are burning.

281
00:07:33,303 --> 00:07:34,594
Oh my gosh, okay, hold up.

282
00:07:34,594 --> 00:07:35,427
Give me the tongs.

283
00:07:35,427 --> 00:07:36,688
Throw me some tongs.

284
00:07:36,688 --> 00:07:37,521
Okay, here we go.

285
00:07:37,521 --> 00:07:38,668
Oh my gosh.

286
00:07:38,668 --> 00:07:40,835
The Coca-Cola like boiled.

287
00:07:41,857 --> 00:07:43,106
What is this?

288
00:07:43,106 --> 00:07:44,523
Come on in close.

289
00:07:45,768 --> 00:07:47,178
Yo, what is this?

290
00:07:47,178 --> 00:07:49,095
This thing got wrecked!

291
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,203
Oh my God!

292
00:07:51,203 --> 00:07:52,523
Yo, is it on fire?

293
00:07:52,523 --> 00:07:54,248
That thing is on, what is going on?

294
00:07:54,248 --> 00:07:55,645
(coughs)

295
00:07:55,645 --> 00:07:56,568
(hisses)

296
00:07:56,568 --> 00:07:58,469
Oh my gosh, okay!

297
00:07:58,469 --> 00:07:59,916
That got real crazy.

298
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:00,925
Oh my gosh.

299
00:08:00,925 --> 00:08:02,997
Yo, my mom is gonna be so mad.

300
00:08:02,997 --> 00:08:05,914
This was her favorite pot, and now.

301
00:08:07,922 --> 00:08:09,350
This thing is absolutely ruined.

302
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:10,183
Wait, hold on.

303
00:08:10,183 --> 00:08:11,016
I want to see what happened to the phone.

304
00:08:11,016 --> 00:08:11,849
Yo, what?

305
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:16,834
Look at this. It literally broke the screen off of it.

306
00:08:16,834 --> 00:08:19,125
(rewind sound)

307
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:22,323
If the iPhone works after this I will be amazed.

308
00:08:22,323 --> 00:08:23,740
Okay, here we go.

309
00:08:29,033 --> 00:08:30,450
It's a crackling.

310
00:08:31,948 --> 00:08:33,033
Alright, guys, here we go.

311
00:08:33,033 --> 00:08:34,564
The moment of truth.

312
00:08:34,564 --> 00:08:36,117
Time to check out the iPhone.

313
00:08:36,117 --> 00:08:38,583
Let me grab it out of here.

314
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:39,416
What?

315
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:40,688
It's not even damaged at all.

316
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:41,521
This is crazy.

317
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,824
Oh my gosh it's hot!

318
00:08:43,824 --> 00:08:45,827
I can't hold it properly, but I want to show you guys-

319
00:08:45,827 --> 00:08:46,660
Look at this.

320
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,546
It's not even really damaged.

321
00:08:47,546 --> 00:08:48,629
Look at this.

322
00:08:49,684 --> 00:08:50,519
It really is water resistant.

323
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:52,259
So, now here's the moment of truth.

324
00:08:52,259 --> 00:08:54,253
Does this thing really turn on?

325
00:08:54,253 --> 00:08:55,936
I can't hold it.

326
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:58,299
It's literally the boiling and it's very hot right now.

327
00:08:58,299 --> 00:09:01,590
How do I even open this without burning my fingers off?

328
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,541
Because it is.

329
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:05,938
I'm pretty positive this phone did not survive,

330
00:09:05,938 --> 00:09:06,835
but how do I turn this on?

331
00:09:06,835 --> 00:09:11,597
I'm gonna press the power button right over here, let's see.

332
00:09:11,597 --> 00:09:13,821
Beside the fact that this phone is now a little bit sticky,

333
00:09:13,821 --> 00:09:15,085
that's the only possible damage.

334
00:09:15,085 --> 00:09:17,427
And I don't think, nope.

335
00:09:17,427 --> 00:09:18,961
The phone doesn't turn on, guys.

336
00:09:18,961 --> 00:09:20,830
Well, maybe it's just a key lock on it.

337
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:21,919
Maybe it actually is dead.

338
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,061
But thank you guys so much for watching,

339
00:09:23,061 --> 00:09:23,894
and I will see you guys.

340
00:09:23,894 --> 00:09:24,727
(gasps)

341
00:09:24,727 --> 00:09:25,951
It's actually really sharp, too.

342
00:09:25,951 --> 00:09:26,981
So there you guys have it

343
00:09:26,981 --> 00:09:28,350
Please give this video a thumbs up for the fact

344
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:31,282
that I went all the way and really did it.

345
00:09:31,282 --> 00:09:32,163
Like, to the max.

346
00:09:32,163 --> 00:09:33,532
And also, if this video gets enough thumbs up

347
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:35,193
then I will do another one of these boiling videos.

348
00:09:35,193 --> 00:09:36,776
But, for right now.

349
00:09:39,229 --> 00:09:40,999
I gotta figure out how to clean this up.

350
00:09:40,999 --> 00:09:41,859
Alright, bye.

351
00:09:41,859 --> 00:09:44,692
(sad piano music)

352
00:09:51,067 --> 00:09:54,234
(upbeat techno music)
