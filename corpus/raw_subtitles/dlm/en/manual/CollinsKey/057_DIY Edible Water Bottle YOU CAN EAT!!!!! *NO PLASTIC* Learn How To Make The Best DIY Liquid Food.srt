1
00:00:00,206 --> 00:00:01,925
- You guys, this is literally a DIY

2
00:00:01,925 --> 00:00:04,363
edible water bottle, check this out.

3
00:00:04,363 --> 00:00:05,196
You challenged us to make a DIY

4
00:00:05,196 --> 00:00:08,473
edible water bottle you can actually eat.

5
00:00:08,473 --> 00:00:09,541
Check this out.

6
00:00:09,541 --> 00:00:12,002
- Wait, bro, wait, what are you doing?

7
00:00:12,002 --> 00:00:13,151
That's not the edible one.

8
00:00:13,151 --> 00:00:14,429
Bro, that's a real water bottle!

9
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:16,542
You actually broke the water bottle.

10
00:00:16,542 --> 00:00:19,367
- Legit split in half, oh! - Dude!

11
00:00:19,367 --> 00:00:20,629
- So basically we are going to be making

12
00:00:20,629 --> 00:00:22,707
three different types of actual edible water bottles,

13
00:00:22,707 --> 00:00:24,820
and at the end of this we're going to be eating them

14
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,585
and whoever makes the worst ones

15
00:00:26,585 --> 00:00:28,721
gets DIY edible water bottles chucked at their face

16
00:00:28,721 --> 00:00:31,438
in beautiful slow motion.

17
00:00:31,438 --> 00:00:32,271
You're gonna lose.

18
00:00:32,271 --> 00:00:33,145
- I'm pointing at you 'cause you're gonna lose.

19
00:00:33,145 --> 00:00:33,978
- No, you're gonna lose.

20
00:00:33,978 --> 00:00:34,811
- I don't think so.

21
00:00:34,811 --> 00:00:35,861
- You're gonna- well let's just start making

22
00:00:35,861 --> 00:00:36,694
these edible water bottles

23
00:00:36,694 --> 00:00:38,659
and let's consume some liquid.

24
00:00:38,659 --> 00:00:40,970
The step one ... (glass breaking)

25
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:43,269
Oh my God, there's so much glass everywhere

26
00:00:43,269 --> 00:00:44,372
and I thought it was all about to break,

27
00:00:44,372 --> 00:00:46,601
but guys we're starting out with a classic water bottle,

28
00:00:46,601 --> 00:00:49,677
so for what you're going to need, one cup of water,

29
00:00:49,677 --> 00:00:53,954
- And one gram of sodium alg ... inate, aljinate.

30
00:00:53,954 --> 00:00:54,787
This stuff.

31
00:00:54,787 --> 00:00:56,450
- Sodium alligator, that's all you need for this.

32
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:57,283
(laughs)

33
00:00:57,283 --> 00:00:58,331
One cup, wooo.

34
00:00:58,331 --> 00:01:01,245
- Sounds like you're having fun over there.

35
00:01:01,245 --> 00:01:02,429
- No like one half a cup.

36
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:03,962
Just gotta drink it I guess.

37
00:01:03,962 --> 00:01:06,249
- I haven't even had a gram yet.

38
00:01:06,249 --> 00:01:07,898
Aw, what are you doing?

39
00:01:07,898 --> 00:01:10,311
You can't drink water?

40
00:01:10,311 --> 00:01:12,238
- How did I get three grams all of a sudden?

41
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,548
Okay I guess we're taking this, and we're putting it back.

42
00:01:14,548 --> 00:01:16,151
- I probably should be having this on a level surface,

43
00:01:16,151 --> 00:01:17,184
because like in my hand I'm like,

44
00:01:17,184 --> 00:01:18,740
"Yeah we're like 3/4 cup," and then I'm like,

45
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,400
"Holy cow we're a cup and a half!"

46
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,932
This is not a good way of doing it.

47
00:01:21,932 --> 00:01:23,523
- Wait, what are you doing?

48
00:01:23,523 --> 00:01:25,079
- It's not ... It's still wiggling, bro.

49
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:26,855
Ah! Wiggling!

50
00:01:26,855 --> 00:01:28,326
I have an ... ow! ... I have an idea.

51
00:01:28,326 --> 00:01:30,428
- Wait, where are you going now? Collins!

52
00:01:30,428 --> 00:01:32,390
- I know how to solve the problem.

53
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:33,473
- Wait, what?

54
00:01:36,378 --> 00:01:37,719
- (coughs) Water's not good for me, bro.

55
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:38,552
It was three straws at once.

56
00:01:38,552 --> 00:01:40,691
I thought the tactic would work, but it didn't.

57
00:01:40,691 --> 00:01:42,189
It's a lot harder than you would think.

58
00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:43,454
- Really? Is it?

59
00:01:43,454 --> 00:01:44,287
- In the meantime I'm gonna add

60
00:01:44,287 --> 00:01:46,299
my first cup of water into my bowl.

61
00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:47,866
- Making moves, man. - Yes, sir.

62
00:01:47,866 --> 00:01:49,275
- Hey we're going to add this into yours.

63
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,108
- Aw, thank you.

64
00:01:50,108 --> 00:01:52,204
- Now, do I add this? - Yeah, add that in, yep.

65
00:01:52,204 --> 00:01:54,514
Here we go, gonna dump this in mine.

66
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:57,182
Here we go, now, to mix it.

67
00:01:57,182 --> 00:01:58,900
Holy cow this thing is powerful, bro.

68
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,990
- Dude, what are you doing?

69
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,755
(screams)

70
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:03,588
You ready? - Yep.

71
00:02:03,588 --> 00:02:05,190
- I feel like this is way too fast for this.

72
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,023
(Collins screams)

73
00:02:06,023 --> 00:02:07,895
I feel like this isn't efficient, at all.

74
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:09,776
(screams)

75
00:02:09,776 --> 00:02:11,819
- Yo this mixer's legit, but it's very scary.

76
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:13,962
Alright there we go, now it's time to let them sit,

77
00:02:13,962 --> 00:02:15,575
wait for the bubbles to go away,

78
00:02:15,575 --> 00:02:18,048
and then we get to make the liquid water bottles.

79
00:02:18,048 --> 00:02:20,370
Yep so then (screams) ... Jeez, yep okay yeah

80
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,123
let's get this out of my hands as quick as possible.

81
00:02:22,123 --> 00:02:25,235
- Next up, we are putting five grams of sodium lactate-

82
00:02:25,235 --> 00:02:27,209
- Wait, I got the alligator stuff, yikes!

83
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:29,496
- Taking five grams of this stuff and putting it into

84
00:02:29,496 --> 00:02:31,353
- [Both] four cups of water.

85
00:02:31,353 --> 00:02:32,340
- Are we gonna dump this on here?

86
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,652
- Look at that, now we've got five,

87
00:02:33,652 --> 00:02:34,485
look at how awesome that was.

88
00:02:34,485 --> 00:02:37,469
- Now time to whisk all the calcium lactate.

89
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:38,302
- Yep.

90
00:02:38,302 --> 00:02:39,686
- Alright so how do I turn this on?

91
00:02:39,686 --> 00:02:41,566
- Bro, it's just a regular whisk.

92
00:02:41,566 --> 00:02:43,412
- Oh. So apparently we have to just like gently do it.

93
00:02:43,412 --> 00:02:45,978
So, whip it ... into the ... sauce, boy!

94
00:02:45,978 --> 00:02:48,765
- If that's gentle, I'm scared to see what not gentle is.

95
00:02:48,765 --> 00:02:52,932
- (wailing) Done. Just like, boom.

96
00:02:54,697 --> 00:02:56,592
Okay for this next part you gotta use a ladle.

97
00:02:56,592 --> 00:02:57,817
Wait, where are my la- - It's over here.

98
00:02:57,817 --> 00:02:58,650
- You, dude you stole my ladle.

99
00:02:58,650 --> 00:02:59,529
- Alright, so next up,

100
00:02:59,529 --> 00:03:01,584
- Here it's, we just take a little bit out of it,

101
00:03:01,584 --> 00:03:02,432
I don't know how much,

102
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:03,744
and then apparently we're supposed to like just set it in.

103
00:03:03,744 --> 00:03:05,801
Oops, okay so we gotta, you gotta set it in.

104
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:06,634
- I'm tilting mine.

105
00:03:06,634 --> 00:03:09,145
- Alright mine's going under, it's submerging, ohh.

106
00:03:09,145 --> 00:03:11,130
Oh there's not enough water in the bowl!

107
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:12,233
- Don't you dare bump me.

108
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:13,510
- I think I did it, dude, look at that!

109
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:15,321
Look at that, it's like a little (nonsense words).

110
00:03:15,321 --> 00:03:17,667
These are looking, almost like little alien pods.

111
00:03:17,667 --> 00:03:18,932
These look kinda weird.

112
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:23,135
- Ooh, I just made a really, really, really good one.

113
00:03:23,135 --> 00:03:23,968
I think.

114
00:03:23,968 --> 00:03:25,201
- Oh, oh, oh! - What?

115
00:03:25,201 --> 00:03:28,247
- It's awesome. Next up ... grab the spatula.

116
00:03:28,247 --> 00:03:29,144
- Why would you throw it like that?

117
00:03:29,144 --> 00:03:31,245
- I didn't throw it, it came out of nowhere.

118
00:03:31,245 --> 00:03:32,078
- Really?

119
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:34,502
- Three ... two ... one ... Next up ... grab the spatula.

120
00:03:34,502 --> 00:03:35,942
So we're just kinda like, supposed to gently mix it around,

121
00:03:35,942 --> 00:03:37,010
which is gonna be tough for me, 'cause I'm

122
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,740
like super amped right now, I'm like really lit.

123
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,577
- Why do we mix this? How is this gonna set?

124
00:03:40,577 --> 00:03:41,506
- I don't know, it's ... apparently for three minutes

125
00:03:41,506 --> 00:03:43,027
we have to kind of like mix it all around.

126
00:03:43,027 --> 00:03:44,339
I feel like you know, when you look in the sky

127
00:03:44,339 --> 00:03:46,255
and you see a cloud and you're like, "Oh, that looks like,

128
00:03:46,255 --> 00:03:47,555
"I don't know, Egypt or whatever."

129
00:03:47,555 --> 00:03:49,599
Like you see a giant cloud, like a pyramid of whatever.

130
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,154
I feel like this is kinda similar, a pyramid.

131
00:03:51,154 --> 00:03:54,737
(X-Files theme song plays)

132
00:03:55,589 --> 00:03:56,646
Mine looks like, I'm not gonna lie,

133
00:03:56,646 --> 00:03:59,325
some of it looks like weird kind of like mucus strands.

134
00:03:59,325 --> 00:04:00,393
Like, look at that, that's just

135
00:04:00,393 --> 00:04:02,390
kind of like weirdly hanging.

136
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,574
- Oh wait, I wanna touch it. - Don't touch it!

137
00:04:03,574 --> 00:04:05,687
You touched it, stop touching it!

138
00:04:05,687 --> 00:04:07,173
- It's like a spaghetti.

139
00:04:07,173 --> 00:04:08,659
- Three minutes of mixing is now complete.

140
00:04:08,659 --> 00:04:10,598
This one is my little kidney.

141
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:12,572
Whoa, that looks cool!

142
00:04:12,572 --> 00:04:14,011
Look at the little strands on it, man.

143
00:04:14,011 --> 00:04:14,952
- Ugh.

144
00:04:14,952 --> 00:04:16,391
- Oh that looks pretty funky looking.

145
00:04:16,391 --> 00:04:17,523
- I don't even know what this stuff is.

146
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:19,299
- These ones are connected, man, that's kind of weird.

147
00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:20,620
There we go, I'm gonna place these down here.

148
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,548
Mine is done.

149
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:23,394
- What even is this stuff, man?

150
00:04:23,394 --> 00:04:25,658
- This stuff is kind of like slimy, but it's almost like ...

151
00:04:25,658 --> 00:04:27,281
I don't know how to ... it's like gelatinous.

152
00:04:27,281 --> 00:04:28,306
- Yeah that's a good work.

153
00:04:28,306 --> 00:04:31,638
- Like it feels like gelatin almost, like the outside of it.

154
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:32,799
- Lookie, this stuff is, wait,

155
00:04:32,799 --> 00:04:33,632
is that like an earring you have it on?

156
00:04:33,632 --> 00:04:35,456
- Oh it is what you think it is, an earring.

157
00:04:35,456 --> 00:04:38,256
- This is like modern jewelry.

158
00:04:38,256 --> 00:04:41,335
Yeah, so I guess we've made round number one.

159
00:04:41,335 --> 00:04:42,810
Again, we're gonna be eating these at the end

160
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,621
and chucking these at the loser's face.

161
00:04:44,621 --> 00:04:47,326
This stuff is so, so, so, so cool.

162
00:04:47,326 --> 00:04:49,402
I'm like tripping out right now, man, this is insane.

163
00:04:49,402 --> 00:04:50,527
- Achoo! - Eww!

164
00:04:50,527 --> 00:04:53,940
- Ugh, ugh, it's just one of those things,

165
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:54,906
one of the water bottles.

166
00:04:54,906 --> 00:04:57,892
- I was like bro, that was so gross, oh my gosh ...

167
00:04:57,892 --> 00:04:59,700
- Got ya, fam!

168
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,780
- Round number two we are making colorful versions

169
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,510
of this edible water bottle.

170
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,310
Instead of going through the entire process all over again,

171
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,562
we'll spare you guys and just add the food coloring

172
00:05:07,562 --> 00:05:09,942
and then make this legit-ness.

173
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:10,775
I think we're gonna start off

174
00:05:10,775 --> 00:05:12,102
just doing one drop in the beginning.

175
00:05:12,102 --> 00:05:14,314
The tension's building, oh there we go, okay.

176
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,058
- Whoa. - That was not one drop.

177
00:05:16,058 --> 00:05:17,858
Now we're gonna grab our spoons and just kind of start

178
00:05:17,858 --> 00:05:20,632
to mix it up and see if it was enough food coloring or not.

179
00:05:20,632 --> 00:05:21,932
I think mine actually looks perfect.

180
00:05:21,932 --> 00:05:23,442
I think yours is like, way too blue.

181
00:05:23,442 --> 00:05:24,928
- Aw mine is way too much.

182
00:05:24,928 --> 00:05:25,772
- This one is gonna look crazy,

183
00:05:25,772 --> 00:05:27,316
because we're gonna take a giant scoop of it

184
00:05:27,316 --> 00:05:28,593
and put it in here.

185
00:05:28,593 --> 00:05:29,650
Because of the food coloring,

186
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:31,624
I have no idea what is going to happen.

187
00:05:31,624 --> 00:05:33,548
But first, I've actually got a challenge for you.

188
00:05:33,548 --> 00:05:35,707
This is actually going to be a bit of a race,

189
00:05:35,707 --> 00:05:37,321
because I wanna see if you can subscribe to this channel,

190
00:05:37,321 --> 00:05:39,187
turn on the channel's post notifications

191
00:05:39,187 --> 00:05:40,446
and then give this video a thumbs up

192
00:05:40,446 --> 00:05:42,787
in the amount of time it takes me to chug this water.

193
00:05:42,787 --> 00:05:45,304
So let's see who's faster, you or me.

194
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:47,718
Here we go, ready, set, go!

195
00:05:47,718 --> 00:05:50,385
(clock ticking)

196
00:05:55,892 --> 00:05:58,842
Done, ugh! My belly hurts, but if you can do that,

197
00:05:58,842 --> 00:06:01,169
comment down below, Keyper Squad, right now.

198
00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:03,372
I'm gonna try and get as much in as I possibly can

199
00:06:03,372 --> 00:06:05,729
onto my spoon because I'm only making one of these.

200
00:06:05,729 --> 00:06:07,192
Hopefully, I don't mess it up.

201
00:06:07,192 --> 00:06:08,631
- Alright, it has been submerged.

202
00:06:08,631 --> 00:06:10,965
I'm so nervous, ahhh.

203
00:06:10,965 --> 00:06:13,380
- Is it going? - Sort of kind of, not really.

204
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,365
- Alright here we go, boom, submerged.

205
00:06:15,365 --> 00:06:18,813
- Oh no, I made another terrible one.

206
00:06:18,813 --> 00:06:21,739
- Mine is just not coming off of my spoon.

207
00:06:21,739 --> 00:06:23,922
Oh there we go, oh this is not good, this is not good.

208
00:06:23,922 --> 00:06:26,267
It's just a whole bunch of gloop off my spoon.

209
00:06:26,267 --> 00:06:28,934
Yo, look at this, what on earth?

210
00:06:29,796 --> 00:06:31,271
I do have enough for one more try.

211
00:06:31,271 --> 00:06:32,873
Okay I'm just gonna try to dump it in my spoon.

212
00:06:32,873 --> 00:06:35,265
- Oh no, dude, mine's already a goner.

213
00:06:35,265 --> 00:06:37,645
- My one good one attached to my new bad one.

214
00:06:37,645 --> 00:06:38,806
- I have to start mixing mine,

215
00:06:38,806 --> 00:06:40,350
I'm gonna just start mixing mine.

216
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,871
- Oh but one of mine is just a blob

217
00:06:41,871 --> 00:06:43,647
of destruction and doom and sadness.

218
00:06:43,647 --> 00:06:45,075
- Is your water turning the color

219
00:06:45,075 --> 00:06:46,271
of your color dye, 'cause mine is.

220
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,768
- Yeah mine is as well.

221
00:06:47,768 --> 00:06:49,127
- One of mine looks like a jellyfish.

222
00:06:49,127 --> 00:06:52,703
- Jellyfish, jellyfish, does whatever a ...

223
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:53,536
that's not the song.

224
00:06:53,536 --> 00:06:55,408
Now we're gonna pull it out so Devan you go first.

225
00:06:55,408 --> 00:06:57,347
- Alright, I got my light bulb-looking one.

226
00:06:57,347 --> 00:06:58,868
- It actually looks really cool.

227
00:06:58,868 --> 00:06:59,971
- That actually does look pretty cool.

228
00:06:59,971 --> 00:07:01,491
- That looks awesome! - It looks pretty good.

229
00:07:01,491 --> 00:07:02,722
- This one looks kind of nice as well.

230
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:05,555
- That's a cute one. - It's a little cherry, man.

231
00:07:05,555 --> 00:07:06,414
Okay now you're pulling out

232
00:07:06,414 --> 00:07:07,923
your squid-looking jellyfish one?

233
00:07:07,923 --> 00:07:10,594
- Yeah, I'm- - Ohhh you popped it!

234
00:07:10,594 --> 00:07:13,101
- I popped it into two. Nooooo.

235
00:07:13,101 --> 00:07:14,007
- No, he popped it.

236
00:07:14,007 --> 00:07:15,075
- I popped it. Alright, just one.

237
00:07:15,075 --> 00:07:16,538
- Ew. - That looks gross.

238
00:07:16,538 --> 00:07:19,046
- Yeah, we're gonna ... - Yeah that one goes back.

239
00:07:19,046 --> 00:07:21,454
Okay. - Okay cool we made one!

240
00:07:21,454 --> 00:07:24,376
I cannot wait to flipping eat this stuff.

241
00:07:24,376 --> 00:07:25,877
'Cause it's gonna be so cool.

242
00:07:25,877 --> 00:07:30,765
We are making the first-ever jumbo edible water bottles,

243
00:07:30,765 --> 00:07:32,948
and it's gonna be crazy, and then remember-

244
00:07:32,948 --> 00:07:34,840
- It's gonna be that big! - It's gonna be this big!

245
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,233
- [Sponge Bob Narrator] A few moments later ...

246
00:07:36,233 --> 00:07:38,335
- Alright guys, a little update,

247
00:07:38,335 --> 00:07:41,376
I accidentally popped mine, so yeah.

248
00:07:41,376 --> 00:07:42,688
It was here and I was trying to get

249
00:07:42,688 --> 00:07:45,161
some excess little goop stuff out.

250
00:07:45,161 --> 00:07:46,485
What are you doing?

251
00:07:46,485 --> 00:07:48,087
- What? - What are you doing?

252
00:07:48,087 --> 00:07:49,318
- I'm scooting.

253
00:07:49,318 --> 00:07:50,989
- I popped mine, it's a crisis over here.

254
00:07:50,989 --> 00:07:52,011
- I'm scooting through, bah!

255
00:07:52,011 --> 00:07:55,181
This is about to take some advanced mathematics right now

256
00:07:55,181 --> 00:07:56,876
because we're creating the first-ever

257
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:58,315
massive edible water bottle.

258
00:07:58,315 --> 00:07:59,581
Basically what we're doing, it's super complicated,

259
00:07:59,581 --> 00:08:02,123
you're gonna fill up a whole bunch of cups of water,

260
00:08:02,123 --> 00:08:03,453
see how many fit in this bowl.

261
00:08:03,453 --> 00:08:05,136
That's two cups.

262
00:08:05,136 --> 00:08:06,216
- That's two cups, stop stop stop.

263
00:08:06,216 --> 00:08:08,097
- Okay so basically everything is gonna be times two,

264
00:08:08,097 --> 00:08:09,548
so now Devan it's your turn- - Yep.

265
00:08:09,548 --> 00:08:11,847
- So we're gonna pop that in there, just like that, perfect.

266
00:08:11,847 --> 00:08:12,880
I just wanna say your track record

267
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,648
so far Devan's not been so good.

268
00:08:14,648 --> 00:08:16,154
Oh, fun fact guys, well if you guys have been wondering

269
00:08:16,154 --> 00:08:18,081
if this eight ball goes all the way down, boom.

270
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:19,880
- And calibrated and we're ready to go.

271
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:24,047
- Oh, nice. Watch this, guys, first try, eyeballing it.

272
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:26,583
13. - 13 grams.

273
00:08:27,575 --> 00:08:29,270
Alright, here we go! - No, no!

274
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,116
Let's see now. - Hey, two, alright.

275
00:08:31,116 --> 00:08:33,333
- It's so spread out, it looks so funky right now,

276
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:35,583
but hey, it gets the job done.

277
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,906
You look like you have a lot more than I do.

278
00:08:36,906 --> 00:08:37,928
- Yeah I think I do.

279
00:08:37,928 --> 00:08:39,518
- I'm gonna kind of eyeball it a little bit.

280
00:08:39,518 --> 00:08:40,877
- Oh this is so risky.

281
00:08:40,877 --> 00:08:43,721
That's the wrong one! - Oh no!

282
00:08:43,721 --> 00:08:45,474
- That's the wrong one! (laughing)

283
00:08:45,474 --> 00:08:46,647
- I'm starting over from scratch again,

284
00:08:46,647 --> 00:08:48,249
that was a critical mistake.

285
00:08:48,249 --> 00:08:50,467
(tape fast forwarding)

286
00:08:50,467 --> 00:08:52,440
Perfect, next step is now to mix it

287
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,193
and um, how do we do this again?

288
00:08:54,193 --> 00:08:56,526
(screaming)

289
00:08:58,171 --> 00:08:59,004
- What happened?

290
00:08:59,004 --> 00:09:00,586
- Bro, I think you just went too crazy.

291
00:09:00,586 --> 00:09:02,385
Alright, so I think Devan did too powerful,

292
00:09:02,385 --> 00:09:03,245
so I'm not gonna do powerful here.

293
00:09:03,245 --> 00:09:04,440
I'm just gonna do a little bit.

294
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,659
(yells) Okay we're good.

295
00:09:05,659 --> 00:09:08,620
(yells) Why do I get so scared?

296
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,756
Oh it's all stuck to the outside of it, oh no!

297
00:09:10,756 --> 00:09:12,115
It's not even in the liquid itself.

298
00:09:12,115 --> 00:09:13,136
This is disastrous.

299
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:15,203
- Dude, you're spilling it everywhere.

300
00:09:15,203 --> 00:09:16,036
- I'm doing my best.

301
00:09:16,036 --> 00:09:17,757
Okay I'm just gonna try to relax and like not-

302
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:20,184
- Ah! It sucks it down! - Ah! You literally splashed,

303
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:24,006
Okay, I'm doing this, I'm doing this.

304
00:09:24,006 --> 00:09:24,839
I like this.

305
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:26,728
Now it's time to wait 15 minutes for these to ...

306
00:09:26,728 --> 00:09:28,198
I don't know, whatever they do ... science.

307
00:09:28,198 --> 00:09:29,522
- [Sponge Bob Narrator] Eventually ...

308
00:09:29,522 --> 00:09:30,799
- We doubled the recipe, so now we need

309
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:32,517
10 grams of this stuff.

310
00:09:32,517 --> 00:09:34,375
- Double whisk. - Wee ...

311
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:35,208
So how we're gonna do this,

312
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,219
is Devan is going to go first in his bowl,

313
00:09:37,219 --> 00:09:39,936
and we're going to use the entire bowl and pop it in there,

314
00:09:39,936 --> 00:09:41,248
and then next I'm gonna go.

315
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:42,804
We're gonna have to go one at a time on this.

316
00:09:42,804 --> 00:09:44,847
- I don't know if this is enough water for my whole bowl.

317
00:09:44,847 --> 00:09:46,333
- Yeah, this is gonna be kinda tough,

318
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,585
so we're just gonna kinda see how this whole thing goes.

319
00:09:48,585 --> 00:09:50,631
Here we go Devan, now the moment of truth.

320
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:51,464
- Will it work.

321
00:09:51,464 --> 00:09:52,875
I hope the bowl submerges.

322
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:55,916
- Aw, it's so close. - No it doesn't work.

323
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:57,890
Okay maybe I just tip it a little bit.

324
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:58,723
Aww. - No.

325
00:09:59,846 --> 00:10:01,570
- But I gotta flip it now.

326
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:04,728
- Go for it, I believe in you, do it, go go go.

327
00:10:04,728 --> 00:10:06,051
- That completely worked.

328
00:10:06,051 --> 00:10:07,932
- I don't know if that worked. - Dude, look at it.

329
00:10:07,932 --> 00:10:11,843
- It looks like an oblong weird thing.

330
00:10:11,843 --> 00:10:13,226
I've never seen it this big though,

331
00:10:13,226 --> 00:10:15,228
this could legit be an actual water bottle

332
00:10:15,228 --> 00:10:16,261
with how big this thing is.

333
00:10:16,261 --> 00:10:18,455
'Cause if it works, this is going to be legendary.

334
00:10:18,455 --> 00:10:20,882
- I fell like it might pop with all the weight of it.

335
00:10:20,882 --> 00:10:22,612
- Oh I didn't even think about that.

336
00:10:22,612 --> 00:10:25,294
- I just gotta stop it, slow it down a little bit.

337
00:10:25,294 --> 00:10:27,337
Whoa, it gets really heavy when you start

338
00:10:27,337 --> 00:10:29,079
to lift it out of the water.

339
00:10:29,079 --> 00:10:31,329
- Oh my gosh. - Ugh. Noooo!

340
00:10:34,862 --> 00:10:37,247
Oh my gosh! Whoa ...

341
00:10:37,247 --> 00:10:40,973
Whoa, look at that. - Whoa, that looks perfect!

342
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,176
How does that happen?

343
00:10:42,176 --> 00:10:45,509
(slurp) That was weird.

344
00:10:46,483 --> 00:10:49,140
You guys, it is literally a liquid water bottle.

345
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:49,999
Bro, like try sucking it up.

346
00:10:49,999 --> 00:10:51,249
- Okay. - Whoa!

347
00:10:53,436 --> 00:10:54,446
Here we go, the moment of truth.

348
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:55,746
And this giant version was suggested

00:10:55,746 --> 00:10:58,788
by the Instagram Keyper of the week, so shout out to you,

as Instagram Keyper of the week,

352
00:11:01,396 --> 00:11:03,253
check the description down below to find out how.

353
00:11:03,253 --> 00:11:04,086
Alright, so what I'm gonna try to do,

354
00:11:04,086 --> 00:11:05,160
I'm gonna try to actually like

355
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,064
move all this liquid into the bowl here.

356
00:11:07,064 --> 00:11:09,124
It's kind of like blasting holes in it almost,

357
00:11:09,124 --> 00:11:09,957
it looks like. - Yeah.

358
00:11:09,957 --> 00:11:10,790
- It's kind of crazy.

359
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,095
Alright, I'm gonna have to tip it back a little bit.

360
00:11:12,095 --> 00:11:15,737
Alright let's see if we can make this magic happen.

361
00:11:15,737 --> 00:11:17,448
It's like barely coming out, will it come out?

362
00:11:17,448 --> 00:11:19,973
A lot of it's stuck to the side.

363
00:11:19,973 --> 00:11:22,312
It's coming back, it's coming out, it's doing it.

364
00:11:22,312 --> 00:11:23,996
That looks insane.

365
00:11:23,996 --> 00:11:27,039
- That looks so good, it looks too good.

366
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:28,825
Dude, it looks like a goldfish.

367
00:11:28,825 --> 00:11:30,010
- I know, it does.

368
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:31,322
- It's like swimming around and stuff.

369
00:11:31,322 --> 00:11:33,086
- Before I remove this and eat it,

370
00:11:33,086 --> 00:11:34,700
it's the moment you've all been waiting for.

371
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,175
Time to taste-test all of these

372
00:11:36,175 --> 00:11:37,997
different edible water bottles and remember,

373
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:39,472
whoever made the best ones,

374
00:11:39,472 --> 00:11:42,746
they get to chuck these at the loser's face in slow motion.

375
00:11:42,746 --> 00:11:43,698
So first we're going to start off

376
00:11:43,698 --> 00:11:45,880
with the basic clear ones and Devan's gonna go first.

377
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,435
- Alright, oh no they're all stuck together.

378
00:11:48,435 --> 00:11:50,896
Oh no, what is ... alright.

379
00:11:50,896 --> 00:11:51,729
- There we go, okay.

380
00:11:51,729 --> 00:11:52,562
- That actually looks kind of good.

381
00:11:52,562 --> 00:11:53,562
Ready? - Yep.

382
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:58,670
Is it crazy?

383
00:12:00,718 --> 00:12:02,076
- Kinda has a weird taste at the end,

384
00:12:02,076 --> 00:12:04,619
but dude the way it pops is so cool.

385
00:12:04,619 --> 00:12:05,452
- Okay I can't wait.

386
00:12:05,452 --> 00:12:07,916
You guys, this is literally a DIY edible water bottle,

387
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,166
check this out.

388
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:14,528
- Dude is it good? - It's so good!

389
00:12:14,528 --> 00:12:15,540
That's awesome.

390
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,968
Yo, I got another one, I gotta try this again.

391
00:12:16,968 --> 00:12:19,719
Oh, these ones are stuck together, ah.

392
00:12:19,719 --> 00:12:22,327
(laughing)

393
00:12:22,327 --> 00:12:23,823
(slurp)

394
00:12:23,823 --> 00:12:26,133
- Oh that was so cool!

395
00:12:26,133 --> 00:12:27,155
- Round one, I think I'm actually

396
00:12:27,155 --> 00:12:28,386
gonna give it to Devan on that one.

397
00:12:28,386 --> 00:12:29,297
- Really? Yeah!

398
00:12:29,297 --> 00:12:31,897
- Your first one, that was so smooth and so perfect looking.

399
00:12:31,897 --> 00:12:34,114
So now, next round is colors, Devan take it away.

400
00:12:34,114 --> 00:12:36,901
- It's really just food coloring and water at this point.

401
00:12:36,901 --> 00:12:37,734
- Okay.

402
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,175
It's like weird, like ... - Great.

403
00:12:40,175 --> 00:12:42,589
- Oh your teeth are blue. - No, no, really?

404
00:12:42,589 --> 00:12:43,797
- Alright now the moment of truth.

405
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:46,084
How did mine turn out, let's see if I can get it out.

406
00:12:46,084 --> 00:12:47,477
- Dude. - Oh.

407
00:12:47,477 --> 00:12:50,507
- Bro, that's so cool, it looks like a ruby or something.

408
00:12:50,507 --> 00:12:52,307
- So for this one, I don't think I'm gonna eat it

409
00:12:52,307 --> 00:12:53,863
'cause my mouth will just like turn red,

410
00:12:53,863 --> 00:12:54,768
but I'm gonna pop it.

411
00:12:54,768 --> 00:12:56,239
Before I pop this, comment down below

412
00:12:56,239 --> 00:12:57,644
what's a drink that we should turn

413
00:12:57,644 --> 00:12:58,477
into an edible water bottle,

414
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:02,084
like a soda, a juice, whatever you want, comment down below.

415
00:13:02,084 --> 00:13:03,593
- Your hand's already red. - I know.

416
00:13:03,593 --> 00:13:04,580
Let me see if I can just kind of ...

417
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,904
oh no it's slipping out of my hand.

418
00:13:05,904 --> 00:13:06,737
I don't know how to do this.

419
00:13:06,737 --> 00:13:09,282
I'm gonna pinch like this ... oh!

420
00:13:09,282 --> 00:13:12,777
Yo, that's nuts. - That's so cool.

421
00:13:12,777 --> 00:13:14,251
- Look at this, it just like comes right off your finger.

422
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:16,492
I hate to say it Devan, but I think I might've

423
00:13:16,492 --> 00:13:20,614
won round two by just a little bit, and now for round three.

424
00:13:20,614 --> 00:13:21,447
- Well mine isn't really a big one,

425
00:13:21,447 --> 00:13:24,992
it's just an assortment of little ones, so uh here's one-

426
00:13:24,992 --> 00:13:26,708
(pop)

427
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:27,541
- It popped.

428
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:28,374
- And uh, here's another- (pop)

429
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:31,126
- It popped. - And here's another.

430
00:13:31,126 --> 00:13:33,424
- There. It's intact, eat it.

431
00:13:33,424 --> 00:13:36,129
Oh, it's so crazy the way it like pops in your mouth,

432
00:13:36,129 --> 00:13:37,151
like the bubble just bursts

433
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:39,322
and like all this delicious water, it's the best.

434
00:13:39,322 --> 00:13:41,215
Here it is, the moment of truth,

435
00:13:41,215 --> 00:13:42,944
the giant edible water bottle.

436
00:13:42,944 --> 00:13:44,338
I don't even know if I can get this out.

437
00:13:44,338 --> 00:13:46,738
Let me just kind of touch it.

438
00:13:46,738 --> 00:13:48,525
Alright here we go.

439
00:13:48,525 --> 00:13:49,358
Oh it's so fragile.

440
00:13:49,358 --> 00:13:53,525
Oh my gosh it's like really an edible water bottle.

441
00:13:54,624 --> 00:13:55,874
- You saved it.

442
00:13:57,001 --> 00:13:59,334
- I still gotta say I think I won that final round.

443
00:13:59,334 --> 00:14:00,167
- Yeah. - So you know what that means.

444
00:14:00,167 --> 00:14:02,997
Let's go outside and let's chuck 'em at Devan's face.

445
00:14:02,997 --> 00:14:04,426
But we need it to be a little bit brighter outside,

446
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:05,691
so give me one second.

447
00:14:05,691 --> 00:14:07,340
(claps) Oh that was a weird clap.

448
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,988
Can you clap for me, I can't clap.

449
00:14:08,988 --> 00:14:10,312
- (clap) Whoa! - Whoa!

450
00:14:10,312 --> 00:14:11,705
Alright, let's go outside and do it.

451
00:14:11,705 --> 00:14:13,110
Alright here we go, gonna pick up one of these.

452
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:15,153
Which one do I wanna, ohh ...

453
00:14:15,153 --> 00:14:17,080
That's a good one to start off with.

454
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,601
- [Recorded Voice] Three, two, one, go.

455
00:14:18,601 --> 00:14:21,101
(dance music)

456
00:14:32,614 --> 00:14:33,447
- We're at the finale ...

457
00:14:33,447 --> 00:14:34,280
- Wait, what?

458
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,113
- What everyone wants to see ...

459
00:14:35,113 --> 00:14:36,491
- No! No! No! Why? - Alright, three, two, one.

460
00:14:36,491 --> 00:14:38,991
(dance music)

461
00:14:43,364 --> 00:14:46,070
If you guys wanna see another video,

00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:48,751

00:14:48,751 --> 00:14:50,540

- No! Cut the video! _ Give me a big hug!

466
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:56,436
- We're done, we're done, no!

467
00:14:58,194 --> 00:15:00,728
It's gonna be this big! - Wow, that's big.

468
00:15:00,728 --> 00:15:02,562
- Hello Devan, my hand was saying hi to you.

469
00:15:02,562 --> 00:15:03,895
- Oh hey, oh ow.

470
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:12,895
- The bouncing shoulders of joy brothers.

471
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,513
You know someone's happy when they're like ...
