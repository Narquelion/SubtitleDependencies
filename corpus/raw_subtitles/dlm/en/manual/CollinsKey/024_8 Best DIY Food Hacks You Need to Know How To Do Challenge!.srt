1
00:00:00,067 --> 00:00:00,900
- Yo, we got watermelon!

2
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:01,733
You want some?

3
00:00:01,733 --> 00:00:02,566
- Yeah, of course.

4
00:00:02,566 --> 00:00:03,450
- Alright, here we go just gonna crack it open like this.

5
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:04,813
Yo! - Oh, wait, what?

6
00:00:04,813 --> 00:00:05,810
- Check it out! - How did you do that?

7
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:06,930
- How'd you make it orange?

8
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:08,070
- Orange, wait, you want an orange?

9
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:09,000
Alright, here we go. - Wait, an orange?

10
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,525
- An orange!

11
00:00:10,525 --> 00:00:12,100
So I just gotta smooth it off a little bit and there you go.

12
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:12,933
There's your orange. - I asked how did you

13
00:00:12,933 --> 00:00:14,774
- make it orange, not get me an orange.

14
00:00:14,774 --> 00:00:15,607
- Alright, well right now we're gonna show you

15
00:00:15,607 --> 00:00:16,800
how to peel a watermelon.

16
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,290
So right now, let's go.

17
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:19,530
For this kitchen hack, the secret is

18
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,043
you don't need one watermelon, you need

19
00:00:21,043 --> 00:00:22,397
two watermelons! - Two watermelons!

20
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:23,590
- And so here's what we're going to do.

21
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,380
First step, we gotta peel one of the watermelons.

22
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,460
So we're going to place one of them off

23
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,450
to the side right now.

24
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:29,180
And now, we have to peel the melon.

25
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:30,480
If you do this at home and if you're using

26
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,930
a knife, you must be very careful.

27
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:33,390
Even if you need to ask for someone else who's very

28
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,170
experienced with knives to help you out on this.

29
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,600
Fun fact, watermelons actually have micro-hairs on them.

30
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,433
- Wait, what?

31
00:00:38,433 --> 00:00:39,923
I've never seen hair on a watermelon.

32
00:00:39,923 --> 00:00:40,960
- Look at this.

33
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,048
- [Devon] What?

34
00:00:42,048 --> 00:00:42,881
- Deny that, boom - You just

35
00:00:42,881 --> 00:00:43,830
put a mustache on it. - Proof, no!

36
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:44,663
- [Collins] So here we go.

37
00:00:44,663 --> 00:00:46,461
So, it's gonna some shaving cream on it.

38
00:00:46,461 --> 00:00:47,670
Oh! - Oh!

39
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:48,503
- Bro!

40
00:00:48,503 --> 00:00:49,510
- Don't touch, hey, hey, hey, stop, stop!

41
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:50,343
Devon.

42
00:00:50,343 --> 00:00:51,256
- What?

43
00:00:51,256 --> 00:00:52,089
- Shave the melon.

44
00:00:52,089 --> 00:00:53,498
- [Devon] You didn't even take off the hair, bro.

45
00:00:53,498 --> 00:00:54,864
(Collins yells)

46
00:00:54,864 --> 00:00:55,697
- What?

47
00:00:55,697 --> 00:00:57,480
Now, I noticed that Devon used a knife to carve off

48
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,650
the top layer of it, but I think

49
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,560
that he did it the wrong way, per usual.

50
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,430
So, - I did not.

51
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:03,840
- I gotta use super sped up, super awesome sandpaper.

52
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,673
Let's go!

53
00:01:04,673 --> 00:01:06,350
- Wait, what?

54
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:07,183
Whoa, whoa.

55
00:01:07,183 --> 00:01:08,016
- Oh, no! - Whoa!

56
00:01:08,016 --> 00:01:08,849
- [Devon] Hey now!

57
00:01:08,849 --> 00:01:09,682
- No dude, it broke in half!

58
00:01:09,682 --> 00:01:10,920
- [Devon] Dude, you broke it.

59
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,048
- We're going to use this right over here

60
00:01:12,048 --> 00:01:12,980
and we're just gonna relax him.

61
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,540
Now that he's relaxed into a very subdued

62
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,657
and quiet state, it's time to wake him up.

63
00:01:18,657 --> 00:01:20,873
- Oh, oh poor watermelon.

64
00:01:21,889 --> 00:01:22,870
- Dude. Dude. Dude.

65
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,558
Most watermelons are uptight, they're always in a circle.

66
00:01:24,558 --> 00:01:25,455
They're always like, (grunts)

67
00:01:25,455 --> 00:01:27,018
but when you relax them they're like ahhh.

68
00:01:27,018 --> 00:01:27,851
- [Watermelon] Ahhh.

69
00:01:27,851 --> 00:01:29,420
- Alright, mine is all peeled and now it's time

70
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,820
to move on to the next step.

71
00:01:31,654 --> 00:01:33,063
Step one is to cut it in half.

72
00:01:33,063 --> 00:01:35,920
Step two is you scoop out what is inside of the watermelon.

73
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,753
- Just like this.

74
00:01:36,753 --> 00:01:37,962
- [Devon] It's harder than you would expect.

75
00:01:37,962 --> 00:01:39,550
- (tongue clicking) Oh, oh, oh!

76
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:41,626
Devon, if you could just put your finger on my forehead.

77
00:01:41,626 --> 00:01:42,459
(Grunts)

78
00:01:42,459 --> 00:01:44,150
Three, two, one.

79
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,017
Yes!

80
00:01:45,017 --> 00:01:45,850
- Ay! - It worked!

81
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:46,940
- Waiting on slowpoke Devon over here.

82
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:47,940
- I'm ready to go. - Alright, Devon gonna

83
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,080
- go into hyper-speed right now.

84
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,131
Activate it.

85
00:01:50,131 --> 00:01:53,464
(upbeat carinval music)

86
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,453
- And done.

87
00:01:56,453 --> 00:01:57,286
- Alright, hyper-speed is out.

88
00:01:57,286 --> 00:01:58,119
Here's the big reveal.

89
00:01:58,119 --> 00:01:59,640
Three, two, one, ta-dah! - Three, two, one, ta-dah!

90
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,310
- So I'm just gotta crack mine open like that.

91
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,143
Ta-dah!

92
00:02:03,143 --> 00:02:05,550
And you get to comment down below who made a better

93
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:08,870
peeled watermelon and right now we're on to the next round.

94
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:09,910
For this round, you challenged us

95
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,320
to make orange jack-o-lanterns.

96
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,980
So right now, let's go. - Wait.

97
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,213
Dude, all jack-o-lanterns are orange bro.

98
00:02:14,213 --> 00:02:15,640
- No, see this time we're literally

99
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,920
making them out of oranges.

100
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,710
And now with my supersonic hands, I can crush 'em.

101
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,230
These actually makes it harder to grip things.

102
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:22,520
Alright well, right now, let's go!

103
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,290
First step, we gotta tenderize these oranges.

104
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,240
- Jack-o-lanterns are supposed

105
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,040
to be round, not oval shaped, bro.

106
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,802
- We gotta give it the second once over tenderizer.

107
00:02:28,802 --> 00:02:29,998
So, this is it here.

108
00:02:29,998 --> 00:02:32,099
(Grunting)

109
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:32,987
Okay, there we go, perfect, done.

110
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:34,580
And next up, we gotta add some little

111
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,301
magic genie juice on this thing, bro.

112
00:02:36,301 --> 00:02:38,565
(magic music)

113
00:02:38,565 --> 00:02:39,398
And done. - Wow.

114
00:02:39,398 --> 00:02:40,800
- Alright, the genie juice is on it.

115
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,270
- Alright well, while you're doing that,

116
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,300
you're actually supposed to cut off the top of it

117
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,010
and then take out the inside with a spoon.

118
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:47,843
- Oh!

119
00:02:47,843 --> 00:02:48,676
Alright, so now I'm just gonna remove the top.

120
00:02:48,676 --> 00:02:49,509
So, here we go.

121
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:50,530
- It's empty now so the next step is

122
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:51,900
to draw out how my jack-o-lantern is gonna look.

123
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,490
- Alright, the designs are on

124
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:54,810
and now it's time to carve 'em out.

125
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,580
Alright. eyeball number one has been completed.

126
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,810
- Well, this is actually way easier than I expected.

127
00:02:58,810 --> 00:02:59,830
First eye done.

128
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:01,640
Final step is to add the candle.

129
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,280
- These jack-o-lanterns turned out so cool

130
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,040
and bro, yours looks absolutely insane.

131
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,920
So here's the big reveal.

132
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,770
Three, two - Three, two

133
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,780
- Wait, wait, first, five seconds to subscribe to challenge!

134
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,830
We want to see if you can subscribe to this channel

135
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:14,260
and turn on the channel post notifications in five seconds.

136
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,093
Are you ready?

137
00:03:15,093 --> 00:03:15,926
Here we go.

138
00:03:15,926 --> 00:03:18,893
Five, four, three, - Five, four, three,

139
00:03:18,893 --> 00:03:21,300
- Two, one, done. - Two, one, done.

140
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,317

141
00:03:22,317 --> 00:03:23,150
Keyper squad right now.

142
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,670
Ta-dah! - Ta-dah!

143
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:25,503
- Bro!

144
00:03:25,503 --> 00:03:26,336
- Dude! - These are awesome.

145
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:28,360
So you get to comment down below who you think won.

146
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,193
My jack-o-lantern--

147
00:03:29,193 --> 00:03:30,120
- Wait, is yours throwing up?

148
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,190
- So right now guys, we're on to the next one.

149
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,740
So this round you challenged us to make

150
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,300
a whole bunch of aquatic snacks.

151
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,680
- Collins, what are you wearing?

152
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,530
- Bro, I'm a dolphin.

153
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:40,570
Or should I say (dolphin calls)

154
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:41,660
- Uh, wow.

155
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,210
- Now it's time to swim into the round and we dive.

156
00:03:45,182 --> 00:03:46,932
- Dude, you're not even swimming,

157
00:03:46,932 --> 00:03:49,250
you're trawling and clapping.

158
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,230
Do some dives.

159
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,880
What?

160
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,713
Okay.

161
00:03:52,713 --> 00:03:53,546
- Next up, we got the bananas.

162
00:03:53,546 --> 00:03:54,830
So right now we just gonna need one banana.

163
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:55,663
So there we go, perfect.

164
00:03:55,663 --> 00:03:56,580
I got my one banana.

165
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,860
Only thing left is for this to be blessed by the holy llama.

166
00:03:58,860 --> 00:03:59,693
So here we go.

167
00:03:59,693 --> 00:04:00,897
Holy llama, holy llama, uh, uh.

168
00:04:00,897 --> 00:04:02,157
Holy llama, holy llama. - Is this necessary?

169
00:04:02,157 --> 00:04:04,870
- And now, for the final blessing process!

170
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:05,703
There we go!

171
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:08,299
(Trilling)

172
00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:09,290
Woohoo! - Creepy eyed monster.

173
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,650
- Guys, if you do this, be very careful.

174
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:11,483
- I'm crying a little bit.

175
00:04:11,483 --> 00:04:13,820
- Alright, so first step is you cut off this top part

176
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,080
and then you move it off to the side

177
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,444
'cause we're going to use it later.

178
00:04:16,444 --> 00:04:18,777
- Next step, you cut the banana at an angle like that.

179
00:04:18,777 --> 00:04:19,710
- Ay! - Ay!

180
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:21,270
- And this you have to be very, very careful.

181
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:23,320
We're gonna chop down the center of it.

182
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,500
Boom, nailed it.

183
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,690
Now it kind of looks like a little dolphin.

184
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,650
Yo, it's like (dolphin calls)

185
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:28,483
So next up,

186
00:04:28,483 --> 00:04:29,316
- Yes!

187
00:04:29,316 --> 00:04:30,260
- we're going to use this little bit over here.

188
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,530
So you're gonna cut it in half, being very careful.

189
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:33,960
We're gotta add the little eye holes;

190
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,180
a little, little area right over here.

191
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,180
And then we're going to put this little bit

192
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,210
of like rotten stuff in there, or not rotten,

193
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:39,498
but the top of the (gasps)

194
00:04:39,498 --> 00:04:40,510
(laughs) It looks like a little eye.

195
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,960
Next up, we gotta make sure our dolphins can

196
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,070
swim in the great blue ocean of the world.

197
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,670
We're just gonna do this, we're gonna, like that.

198
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,750
You make little triangles on it like that.

199
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:48,950
We're gonna pull up the little fin.

200
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,500
Look at him, he's like yo, what's up?

201
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,580
How you doin' bro?

202
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,707
- Alright, now we add a grape to it.

203
00:04:52,707 --> 00:04:54,750
- Look it's so cute and now all we have

204
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,650
to do is make the ocean habitat in which

205
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,090
it lives and this part is super easy.

206
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,460
Whelp, we got a little bit carried away here.

207
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,960
We made a whole bunch of dolphin friends.

208
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,440
We actually made a whole super pod.

209
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,690
So now, we gotta make the ocean.

210
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:05,040
So we're gonna take out this little tree

211
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,350
'cause there ain't no trees in the ocean.

212
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,183
Yeet!

213
00:05:07,183 --> 00:05:08,016
Alright, so we just need some--

214
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:08,849
- Yeet!

215
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,250
- It's very rare that you out-yeet me,

216
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,040
but today you have out-yeeted me.

217
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,114
Congratulations, Devon.

218
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:15,947
- You're welcome.

219
00:05:15,947 --> 00:05:17,537
(trumpet playing)

220
00:05:17,537 --> 00:05:18,370
- Fleet!

221
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:19,203
Doesn't even work.

222
00:05:19,203 --> 00:05:20,036
I think mine is all mixed up enough so

223
00:05:20,036 --> 00:05:20,940
I'm just gonna start populating it

224
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,610
with my dolphin breed or squad.

225
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:23,600
Squad, no pod?

226
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,433
Pod.

227
00:05:24,433 --> 00:05:25,266
Let's get this little dude in here.

228
00:05:25,266 --> 00:05:26,750
Oh, they're all kind of like falling on over, oof.

229
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,270
That's so cute, they're like sharing this little grape,

230
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,860
but naw fam, star-crossed lovers.

231
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,540
You gonna have to sit at opposite sides, bam!

232
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,880
Now I got my saucer paucer of apple sauces and dolphins.

233
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,530
Well, you know what you guys get to comment down below

234
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:38,580
who made a better pod of dolphins.

235
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,340
Mine's a super pod, his is a regular pod.

236
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,590
We'll be eating these at the end of the video,

237
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,300
but right now we are on to the next round.

238
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,020
You challenged us to the pancake art challenge,

239
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:45,906
but with eggs.

240
00:05:45,906 --> 00:05:46,739
- Oh, oh jeez.

241
00:05:46,739 --> 00:05:47,607
Oh, I caught it! - That was a good catch.

242
00:05:47,607 --> 00:05:48,844
- But right now, here we go, - Dude, what?

243
00:05:48,844 --> 00:05:49,677
- we're gonna do a--

244
00:05:49,677 --> 00:05:50,510
Oh, you're good at it. - You're gonna

245
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,476
crack the eggs, bro. - That was another good catch.

246
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:52,309
- Here we go, another one.

247
00:05:52,309 --> 00:05:53,550
Oh! - Oh, I got it!

248
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,383
- You got it!

249
00:05:54,383 --> 00:05:55,216
- Alright Collins, now it's time

250
00:05:55,216 --> 00:05:56,390
to test your net catching skills.

251
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,263
You ready? - Alright, yeah.

252
00:05:57,263 --> 00:05:58,096
- Here we go! (screaming)

253
00:05:58,096 --> 00:06:00,237
- What! - Oh, it cracked, no!

254
00:06:00,237 --> 00:06:01,140
- [Collins] I got this. - Here you go.

255
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,018
Okay, there we go, you got another one.

256
00:06:02,018 --> 00:06:03,110
- Oh!

257
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,400
Now it's time to crack open some eggs.

258
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,340
So, this is our first egg cracking contraption.

259
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,570
- [Devon] How does this even work?

260
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:09,783
Three, two, one. - Three, two, one.

261
00:06:09,783 --> 00:06:11,548
- Oh! - Oh!

262
00:06:11,548 --> 00:06:12,381
- What?

263
00:06:12,381 --> 00:06:14,535
- (screams) Mind blown!

264
00:06:14,535 --> 00:06:16,060
But you know what, since I accidentally put my yolk

265
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,037
in there, here's the way I'm going to fix it.

266
00:06:17,037 --> 00:06:19,400
We got a stealth cactus.

267
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,850
And then it goes (slurping), and then sucks it.

268
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:21,683
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

269
00:06:21,683 --> 00:06:22,516
Whoops, sorry.

270
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:23,349
Okay, okay. - Oh no, did you break it?

271
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:24,870
- Now this contraption is incredible.

272
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,670
The goal is you place it on top here,

273
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:29,760
and it will cut out a perfect circle at the top of the egg.

274
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,790
Three, two, one.

275
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:34,497
- Oh, no way!

276
00:06:34,497 --> 00:06:36,050
No, it just made a little mark on it.

277
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,660
Three, two, one.

278
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:38,970
- Mine worked.

279
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:39,803
Oh! - Oh!

280
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:41,623
- What?

281
00:06:41,623 --> 00:06:42,702
- What!

282
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:43,760
- Like look at this little hat.

283
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,520
What, I'm stylin' now!

284
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,270
Next up is the very challenging task of

285
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,910
transferring all of these egg whites and egg yolks

286
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,872
into these pancake art bottles.

287
00:06:51,872 --> 00:06:54,560
- But luckily, we have this egg holder

288
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,390
slash funnel-looking thing.

289
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,320
Alright, you ready for this?

290
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,153
- Sure!

291
00:06:58,153 --> 00:06:58,986
- It's working!

292
00:06:58,986 --> 00:07:00,460
- Oh, man I filled it up too fast!

293
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,110
- It's not your fault, it's the funnel's fault.

294
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,002
- Oh, oh!

295
00:07:03,002 --> 00:07:04,920
- Okay, that was partly your fault.

296
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,780
- So we got the egg whites,

297
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,220
and now it's time for the egg yolks.

298
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,680
- Hopefully you've learned, Collins.

299
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,513
- Learned what?

300
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:10,850
I was gonna straight freestyle this thing.

301
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,533
If 50% of it makes it in,

302
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:14,470
that's better than my normal average.

303
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,417
(gasps) Yo!

304
00:07:15,417 --> 00:07:16,250
Haha!

305
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,083
The moment has come.

306
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:17,960
It is time to make the egg art.

307
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,530
So first, we gotta Pam it up a little bit.

308
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:20,560
You know, get a little bit of Pam on--

309
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,393
No, ooh, ooh.

310
00:07:21,393 --> 00:07:23,010
Alright, so I don't know what Devon's going for here.

311
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,640
I have a little bit of an idea of what I'm gonna make.

312
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,473
So, here we go.

313
00:07:25,473 --> 00:07:26,760
Step one, done!

314
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,330
Gonna give him a little ooh!

315
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:29,990
- This stuff does not cooperate.

316
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,760
Now it's time for the eye.

317
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,593
Oh, no!

318
00:07:32,593 --> 00:07:33,960
This is so difficult, bro!

319
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,793
- Like work with me!

320
00:07:34,793 --> 00:07:36,259
- [Devon] Mine is not turning out, dude.

321
00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:38,720
Here we go, I'm just gonna add a little bit more around it.

322
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,880
- I can't work with this.

323
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,330
- I got the touch for this thing!

324
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,430
- Oh, I'm messing it up further!

325
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,830
Alright, it's time for me to flip mine.

326
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:45,663
- Oh, man!

327
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,620
This might me the first art challenge that I'm gonna win!

328
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,453
- You ready for this?

329
00:07:48,453 --> 00:07:49,460
- Yeah! - Three, two, one.

330
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,485
- [Collins] Oh!

331
00:07:50,485 --> 00:07:51,490
- It doesn't even flip like a pancake!

332
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:53,260
- Wait, so what is that?

333
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,330
- It got folded in half.

334
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:55,860
It was supposed to be a chicken, dude.

335
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,693
- Here's the big flip.

336
00:07:56,693 --> 00:07:57,526
You ready?

337
00:07:57,526 --> 00:07:58,359
Three, two, wait, wait, - Two

338
00:07:58,359 --> 00:07:59,460
- first, three second like challenge!

339
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,370
We want to see if you can like this video in three seconds.

340
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:03,203
Are you ready?

341
00:08:03,203 --> 00:08:04,036
Here we go.

342
00:08:04,036 --> 00:08:07,261
Three, two, one, done. - Three, two, one, done.

343
00:08:07,261 --> 00:08:09,645
Three, two, one. - Three, two, one.

344
00:08:09,645 --> 00:08:10,562
- Oh! - Oh!

345
00:08:12,471 --> 00:08:13,304
Aye, I think you did that

346
00:08:13,304 --> 00:08:14,579
good. - I recovered it fully!

347
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:15,890
We're gonna try this one more time, here we go.

348
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:18,290
Three, two, one. - Three, two, one.

349
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,045
Oh, oh! - Oh, oh!

350
00:08:20,045 --> 00:08:20,878
- You just took it out of the pan.

351
00:08:20,878 --> 00:08:21,711
- [Collins] Oh, oh no.

352
00:08:21,711 --> 00:08:22,920
Well this was a complete fail, but you get

353
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,970
to comment down below, even after they both got wrecked,

354
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:25,803
who made a better one?

355
00:08:25,803 --> 00:08:27,100
And right now, we are on to the next one.

356
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,720
For this round you challenged us to turn

357
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,200
an ordinary apple into a terrifying monster.

358
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,740
So right now, the game is 86 to 89 love

359
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,135
and let's just get lit!

360
00:08:35,135 --> 00:08:36,138
(laughing)

361
00:08:36,138 --> 00:08:36,971
Jesus, sorry!

362
00:08:36,971 --> 00:08:37,997
- It snapped on my finger!

363
00:08:37,997 --> 00:08:38,830
- I'm sorry.

364
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:39,860
First step, you're gonna take an apple,

365
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,190
drop it on your cutting board,

366
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,530
and then we're gonna use these paddles.

367
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,150
We use the dog squat of poppin-ness.

368
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,937
- [Devon] Do you take the-- (porcelain crashing)

369
00:08:45,937 --> 00:08:47,330
- Oh, I didn't know.

370
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,550
Next up we're gonna use a dinosaur head

371
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,080
to split this thing in half and fun fact,

372
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,000
T-Rex's heads are 6 times stronger than an actual banana.

373
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,170
- Only 6 times?

374
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:55,003
- Yeah, that's it.

375
00:08:55,003 --> 00:08:56,310
- That's surprisingly little.

376
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,950
- Yeah, a couple little dinisaurs. (yells)

377
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,060
- Oh, dude, oh!

378
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,588
Next up, cut up the strawberries.

379
00:09:01,588 --> 00:09:02,421
- Oh, yeah!

380
00:09:02,421 --> 00:09:03,254
- Just wanna put that out there.

381
00:09:03,254 --> 00:09:04,503
- Wait, you already started?

382
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:05,336
What?

383
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,210
- Like half way through.

384
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,043
- That's crazy.

385
00:09:07,043 --> 00:09:08,340
I got a focus up real quick.

386
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,173
- Almost done.

387
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:10,204
- Wait, What?

388
00:09:10,204 --> 00:09:11,450
Okay, gotta use these to give me a vision into the future.

389
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:12,391
Here we go.

390
00:09:12,391 --> 00:09:13,224
Whoa.

391
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,610
Whoa, dude. - Are you okay?

392
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:17,443
- The future is too crazy, bro.

393
00:09:17,443 --> 00:09:19,667
You don't even wanna know what happened.

394
00:09:19,667 --> 00:09:21,500
The dinisaurs came back.

395
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,857
It was absolute may-

396
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,140
- Next up we take two grapes, a toothpick,

397
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,500
break the toothpick in half, stick the toothpick

398
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,130
in the grape, just like this,

399
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,600
and you attach it to the top as eyes.

400
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,433
- So alright, here we go.

401
00:09:33,433 --> 00:09:34,294
Just gonna feed him some raisins.

402
00:09:34,294 --> 00:09:35,127
Nom, nom, nom, nom!

403
00:09:35,127 --> 00:09:36,190
Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom!

404
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:38,150
- So, the last step is you take some raisins,

405
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:40,650
you take small pieces off of the toothpick,

406
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:43,200
and you attach the to the grapes as little pupils.

407
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,090
- My dude has strawberry eyebrows.

408
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:47,590
Alright, here's the big reveal of our terrifying monsters.

409
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:49,980
Three, two, one, ta-dah! - Three, two, one, ta-dah!

410
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,470
So you get to comment down below

411
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:53,970
and let us know which monster is scarier.

412
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,240
For this round you challenged us

413
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,420
to turn a pineapple, oh my gosh, into a parrot.

414
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,890
First step you gotta grab a pineapple.

415
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:00,730
Ooh. - Watch that snack.

416
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:02,222
See Devon, we're making a pineapple parrot

417
00:10:02,222 --> 00:10:04,070
and this is gonna be the feathers of the parrot.

418
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:04,903
First step's first, you're--

419
00:10:04,903 --> 00:10:06,400
- You have a dusty pineapple, bro.

420
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,760
- I know, I'm just gonna get rid of all the dust.

421
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,650
Be very careful with the knives

422
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:09,850
and maybe ask someone else to help you.

423
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:11,170
But now we're just gonna cut, I'd say about,

424
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:12,617
(high pitched beep) like right here.

425
00:10:12,617 --> 00:10:13,837
You now have the bird!

426
00:10:13,837 --> 00:10:15,960
I know it doesn't look like it, but trust me this is it.

427
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,450
You gotta carve this into the head.

428
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,360
- So how do you do that?

429
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,297
- Well you could either carve it or

430
00:10:19,297 --> 00:10:20,817
you can just take a beak like this,

431
00:10:20,817 --> 00:10:23,220
and just pop it on over the top and then you're finished.

432
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,053
- Seems kind of like cheating bro.

433
00:10:24,053 --> 00:10:25,420
- Yeah, we're not gonna do that so fleet!

434
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,600
Oops.

435
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,900
- I think it would be easier to get this stuff off first.

436
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,220
- You're not supposed to take that stuff off.

437
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,053
- Yeah you are!

438
00:10:31,053 --> 00:10:31,916
- It's the plume-age.

439
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:32,749
This is the feather of the bird.

440
00:10:32,749 --> 00:10:33,582
- No, it doesn't have that much plume-age.

441
00:10:33,582 --> 00:10:34,415
- I'm making a peacock, bro.

442
00:10:34,415 --> 00:10:35,248
A peacock parrot.

443
00:10:35,248 --> 00:10:36,840
Why can't we make a p-carrot?

444
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,950
- Next up after, - Keep it clamped down.

445
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:39,220
- what you do is you use scissors

446
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,530
and you cut off some of these leaves near the bottom.

447
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,130
- Again, unless you're making a p-carrot.

448
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:44,310
Man, this thing is not holding in place.

449
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,330
Alright, there we go, nice.

450
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:47,100
- This reminds me of trimming my bonsai tree.

451
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,407
- Fun fact, Devon has a bonsai tree

452
00:10:48,407 --> 00:10:50,450
and I must say it's in phenomenal condition.

453
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,283
Alright, now here we go.

454
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:53,090
So I think that that is the top of my p-carrot.

455
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:54,960
- Can I just say, I had no idea

456
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,850
how dusty pineapples were, bro.

457
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:57,683
- Well I can help out cleaning it.

458
00:10:57,683 --> 00:10:59,170
- No, no, no, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

459
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,470
That would make it dirtier, bro!

460
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:01,440
- What, this is super clean.

461
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,171
- No, you have a dirty duster

462
00:11:03,171 --> 00:11:04,004
Just sayin'. - Excuse me?

463
00:11:04,004 --> 00:11:07,143
Now I just gotta scoop out the interior of this here.

464
00:11:07,143 --> 00:11:09,690
(groaning)

465
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:11,666
It's just not working, man.

466
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:12,550
(hammering)

467
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,500
Alright, there we go, perfect.

468
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,910
And now just, I don't actually know if that helped at all.

469
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,125
Let's just use a carrot pick.

470
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:19,119
(hammering)

471
00:11:19,119 --> 00:11:19,960
- [Devon] A carrot pick?

472
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,306
- Slinky solutions, let's slink.

473
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:22,139
- Slinky solutions?

474
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:22,972
- Yeah, that's gonna be the name

475
00:11:22,972 --> 00:11:24,940
of my company, Slinky Solutions.

476
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,682
- Next step is shaping the head.

477
00:11:26,682 --> 00:11:27,580
- I'm just gonna have to go into the top

478
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,650
of the pineapple here and just (groans)

479
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:31,480
Here we go, the carrot's still in there.

480
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,590
- Alright, mine is shaped now.

481
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:35,030
It's time for me to carve it out.

482
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:35,863
- Done!

483
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:36,696
Alright so I had to use the pineapple

484
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,440
of destiny to finish it off and you know what,

485
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,002
to celebrate we're going to use the trumpet of triumph.

486
00:11:41,002 --> 00:11:44,002
(saxophone playing)

487
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,360
- Wow dude, that's quite an impressive

488
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,590
lung capacity you have there.

489
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,570
- Yeah, and that's why they call me

490
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:53,010
the clairvoyant clarineter.

491
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:54,450
- It's a saxophone.

492
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:55,374
- Actually, it's a snorkel.

493
00:11:55,374 --> 00:11:58,700
(whistle blowing)

494
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,620
Everything else is ready except now we gotta finish up

495
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,990
the head of my p-carrot and your regular parrot.

496
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:05,010
So right now, let's turn these into a masterpiece.

497
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:06,000
- Dude, yours looks crazy, bro!

498
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,300
- Yeah, I don't know what happened there,

499
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,200
but here's the big reveal!

500
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,490
Three, two, wait, - Two, one

501
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:12,040
- first if you wanna win 15 minute video call

502
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:16,630
with Devon and I, text the word FOOD to 81800 right now!

503
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:19,420
So pause the video and text the word FOOD to 81800,

504
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,050
you will automatically be entered in to win it

505
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:22,300
and right now, here's the big reveal.

506
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,133
You ready?

507
00:12:23,133 --> 00:12:25,380
Three, two, one, ta-dah! - Three, two, one, ta-dah!

508
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,230
- [Devon] Yours is terrifying!

509
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:28,500
- Well I added some extra eyes!

510
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,900
So now it's also spider as well.

511
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,360
So now it's called a sp-carrot.

512
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,500
A spider, parrot, carrot.

513
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,760
So you guys comment down below who made a better one

514
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,600
and right now we are on to the next one.

515
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,470
This round is crazy!

516
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:39,340
I'm literally going to teleport to New York

517
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,840
with special guests for this next one!

518
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,673
- Wait, what?

519
00:12:41,673 --> 00:12:42,506
That's awesome, bro!

520
00:12:42,506 --> 00:12:44,297
- Yeah, so just gotta grab one thing and here we go!

521
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:45,390
I'm gonna miss you, bro!

522
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,223
- Alright, see you later!

523
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:47,056
Have fun! - Alright, here we go!

524
00:12:47,056 --> 00:12:48,370
Three, two, one.

525
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:50,630
- Wait, why did he take my watermelon?

526
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:51,550
- Yo, what's up guys!

527
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,550
It's Collins Key and I'm here with Kelly and Ryan.

528
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,610
I just finished filming their live show

529
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:56,910
and now they're here on the channel.

530
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,520
So we're gonna be making a watermelon shark.

531
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,353
You guys ready?

532
00:12:59,353 --> 00:13:00,186
- We're ready!

533
00:13:00,186 --> 00:13:01,019
Let's go! - A shark that bites back!

534
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:02,050
- Exactly!

535
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,310
Alright, so right now, let's go!

536
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:05,718
- Good news for me, Kelly is a master crafter!

537
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:06,551
- Move your fingers, move your fingers.

538
00:13:06,551 --> 00:13:07,920
- She looks super good at this.

539
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,060
- Alright, so now my dude.

540
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,290
Oh yeah I forgot, we gotta scoop out little balls.

541
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,123
Those are very important.

542
00:13:12,123 --> 00:13:13,300
See, they're already ahead of me on this one.

543
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,880
I'm just kinda going for it at this point.

544
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,560
You guys got the Keyper Squad shirts on so it's all good.

545
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,650
It's meant to get a little messy, you know.

546
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:18,670
Dude, I'm going for the win, bro!

547
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:19,570
Uh oh. - I like it.

548
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:20,451
- Okay now. - Weez good!

549
00:13:20,451 --> 00:13:21,740
These guys are pros!

550
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,573
What?

551
00:13:22,573 --> 00:13:23,406
- Snap, crackle!

552
00:13:23,406 --> 00:13:24,239
- Yo, yo, yo, oh!

553
00:13:24,239 --> 00:13:26,660
- I mean, I really will say that this looks like

554
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,758
something prehistoric and really bad happened to this.

555
00:13:29,758 --> 00:13:30,600
- How?

556
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,070
I really gotta step my game up, man.

557
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:32,930
This is not good.

558
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:35,931
- No, we need a fin so I'm gonna festoon a fin.

559
00:13:35,931 --> 00:13:36,764
- Festoon?

560
00:13:36,764 --> 00:13:37,597
Is that a cooking term?

561
00:13:37,597 --> 00:13:39,110
- It's a carving term. - Yeah, it's a carving term.

562
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,850
- If you're not careful, she'll festoon us, alright?

563
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:42,262
- He looks so sad! (laughs)

564
00:13:42,262 --> 00:13:43,940
- What, that looks so cool! - It looks vicious!

565
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,750
- The whole operation is falling apart over here, guys.

566
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:46,650
- What's happening with you?

567
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:47,483
- You know, just (laughs)

568
00:13:47,483 --> 00:13:49,270
- Have you ever done this before? (laughs)

569
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:50,970
- No, I have never the craft.

570
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:53,620
I mean, that's like, it's there, but like barely.

571
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,453
Okay, well that's good.

572
00:13:54,453 --> 00:13:55,785
I guess we'll just pour it back in now.

573
00:13:55,785 --> 00:13:58,810
- I'm going to take a couple of teeth out.

574
00:13:58,810 --> 00:13:59,840
- Yours vomited!

575
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,430
- Yeah it's looking definitely like it vomited.

576
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:02,609
- So now you fill it back in.

577
00:14:02,609 --> 00:14:03,442
- Look at that.

578
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:05,117
Martha Stewart, eat your heart out!

579
00:14:05,117 --> 00:14:06,450
- Yo, this thing is not turning out.

580
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,190
There's no way that I can win.

581
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,023
Hey bro, can you hear me?

582
00:14:09,023 --> 00:14:10,250
- (yells) Go for Dev.

583
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,280
- I need you to make me a watermelon shark right now.

584
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,247
- Already on it.

585
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:15,034
(intense music)

586
00:14:15,034 --> 00:14:15,980
- Bro, do you have it?

587
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,070
- Almost there.

588
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:18,270
- Dude, hurry up!

589
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:19,843
- Dude, these things take time!

590
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,233
It's ready.

591
00:14:22,233 --> 00:14:23,680
- Alright, so I guess they're working on

592
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,390
their shark over there and I guess we'll give this a shot.

593
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,590
Here we go, three, two, one, bam!

594
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:27,423
Alright, cool!

595
00:14:27,423 --> 00:14:29,699
So I think I'll just add a couple of finishing touches here.

596
00:14:29,699 --> 00:14:31,103
- Wait, hang on, hang on! - Hold on, hold on, time,

597
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:31,936
- Calling time out.

598
00:14:31,936 --> 00:14:33,340
- This is what we ended up with so,

599
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,240
I guess these are the watermelon sharks that

600
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,710
you guys get to comment down below,

601
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,507
who made a better watermelon shark.

602
00:14:38,507 --> 00:14:39,749
- Yeah, who made it? - Wait, no, wait!

603
00:14:39,749 --> 00:14:40,857
- Who made it? - That's illegal.

604
00:14:40,857 --> 00:14:41,959
- Thank you guys so much for being here!

605
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:42,792
- Thank you!

606
00:14:42,792 --> 00:14:43,687
- Alright, you guys I gotta teleport back to LA.

607
00:14:43,687 --> 00:14:46,085
So here we go, three, two, one.

608
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:47,341
- What just happened here?

609
00:14:47,341 --> 00:14:49,924
(upbeat music)

610
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:04,769
- And then finally we're just gonna stick it

611
00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:06,090
in the cactus cup for a second.

612
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:08,497
Just let it sit there as it continues to tenderize.

613
00:15:08,497 --> 00:15:10,670
- Did you break the cactus cup?

614
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:13,180
- Not broken, just altered it and improved it.

615
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,227
Pick it up from, oh!

616
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:16,610
- Hey, you grab a pineapple, bro.

617
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:17,850
- Oh no, we got a little bit of uh oh,

618
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,620
we got some spiky things sticking to the pineapple.

619
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,453
- Oh no.

620
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:21,286
- There we go, get that one out.

621
00:15:21,286 --> 00:15:23,149
So now let's test out how one of these things flies off.

622
00:15:23,149 --> 00:15:23,982
So here we go, we're gonna get--

623
00:15:23,982 --> 00:15:25,130
- What, flies off of what?

624
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:26,290
Remove one of these little pieces here

625
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,581
and place it on the top and then...

626
00:15:27,581 --> 00:15:28,414
- You dropped it!

627
00:15:28,414 --> 00:15:29,247
What was that for?

628
00:15:29,247 --> 00:15:30,960
- So I had to see how it's gonna react

629
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,340
in its aerodynamic ability to fly through the air.

630
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,960
Why does a pirate wanna join the X-Men?

631
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,710
'Cause he wants to become a mutiny.
