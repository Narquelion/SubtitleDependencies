1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:01,513
- Oh my gosh!

2
00:00:01,513 --> 00:00:02,475
You guys challenged us

3
00:00:02,475 --> 00:00:03,775
to make a giant slime stress reliever.

4
00:00:03,775 --> 00:00:04,669
So right now,

5
00:00:04,669 --> 00:00:05,679
let's go!

6
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:07,014
- Oh, not my bucket! No!

7
00:00:07,014 --> 00:00:08,268
- Time to add the glue!

8
00:00:08,268 --> 00:00:09,101
Oh my gosh!

9
00:00:09,101 --> 00:00:10,416
- Oh, it's so heavy!

10
00:00:10,416 --> 00:00:11,309
- Three, two,

11
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:12,142
- Wait, dude, what are you...

12
00:00:12,142 --> 00:00:13,433
ooohhhhh!

13
00:00:13,433 --> 00:00:14,884
- Oh no, I missed the bucket.

14
00:00:14,884 --> 00:00:15,813
- [Devan] You completely missed the bucket.

15
00:00:15,813 --> 00:00:17,514
(laughs)

16
00:00:17,514 --> 00:00:18,347
- Oh!

17
00:00:18,347 --> 00:00:20,523
- This is off to a little bit of a messier start than usual.

18
00:00:20,523 --> 00:00:21,356
Blue is in.

19
00:00:21,356 --> 00:00:22,299
Next up - It got on my sock.

20
00:00:22,299 --> 00:00:23,132
- [Collins] So here we go,

21
00:00:23,132 --> 00:00:23,965
it's gotta kinda

22
00:00:23,965 --> 00:00:24,798
rub it into my hands at this point.

23
00:00:24,798 --> 00:00:25,647
Gotta become one with the glue.

24
00:00:25,647 --> 00:00:28,432
Got some shaving cream here.

25
00:00:28,432 --> 00:00:29,723
Three, two, one...

26
00:00:29,723 --> 00:00:30,556
Oh, wrong way!

27
00:00:30,556 --> 00:00:31,896
- How much of this do we add, bro?

28
00:00:31,896 --> 00:00:32,941
- Add all of it, bro.

29
00:00:32,941 --> 00:00:33,835
We need a ton of shaving cream.

30
00:00:33,835 --> 00:00:34,938
We're making a whole bunch of fluffy slime,

31
00:00:34,938 --> 00:00:36,192
and then we're actually going to add it all into

32
00:00:36,192 --> 00:00:37,527
a Wubble Bubble.

33
00:00:37,527 --> 00:00:38,360
- Oh, nice.

34
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,593
Okay, oh, oh, oh!

35
00:00:39,593 --> 00:00:40,426
- That's for not handing it to me.

36
00:00:40,426 --> 00:00:41,259
- No, No, No!

37
00:00:41,259 --> 00:00:42,092
- You've got to shake it up first, Devan.

38
00:00:42,092 --> 00:00:42,925
- Eh, eh, eh,

39
00:00:42,925 --> 00:00:43,864
- I don't want it to slip out of my hand.

40
00:00:43,864 --> 00:00:44,697
- [Collins] I'm gonna to try to get

41
00:00:44,697 --> 00:00:46,255
like the biggest amount possible in my hand.

42
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:47,265
- So I can smack it!

43
00:00:47,265 --> 00:00:48,098
Oh!

44
00:00:48,098 --> 00:00:49,286
- Alright well now it's time to mix these up,

45
00:00:49,286 --> 00:00:50,539
so Devan, let's get our hands in.

46
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:51,372
- Oh!

47
00:00:51,372 --> 00:00:52,205
- The best part of fluffy slime.

48
00:00:52,205 --> 00:00:53,697
- Oh, it feels so good.

49
00:00:53,697 --> 00:00:54,673
- I've got the one-arm technique,

50
00:00:54,673 --> 00:00:55,601
and then the switch arm.

51
00:00:55,601 --> 00:00:56,820
So now it's time to add the food coloring.

52
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,434
So Devan, what color are you going to make yours?

53
00:00:58,434 --> 00:00:59,409
- I'm going to make mine red.

54
00:00:59,409 --> 00:01:00,710
- That's not a stress-relieving color,

55
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:01,543
I don't think.

56
00:01:01,543 --> 00:01:03,020
Well I'm gonna make mine

57
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:03,853
blue.

58
00:01:03,853 --> 00:01:05,028
It looks so cool.

59
00:01:05,028 --> 00:01:06,050
- Alright, mine's all in.

60
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:06,932
Now it's time to mix it up!

61
00:01:06,932 --> 00:01:08,598
- Why you using your hands bro, we got a stirrer.

62
00:01:08,598 --> 00:01:09,431
- Oh my goodness,

63
00:01:09,431 --> 00:01:10,264
that looks so awesome.

64
00:01:10,264 --> 00:01:11,097
- Now it's time to bring

65
00:01:11,097 --> 00:01:11,930
it all together with the stuff.

66
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:13,016
Oh!

67
00:01:13,016 --> 00:01:14,548
- That's not how you add it, Collins.

68
00:01:14,548 --> 00:01:15,814
- Let's go.

69
00:01:15,814 --> 00:01:17,393
- No, why would you ruin your slime?

70
00:01:17,393 --> 00:01:20,873
- Because it's not going to be ruined, Devan.

71
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:22,748
Yo, like mine's actually working!

72
00:01:22,748 --> 00:01:23,581
- This is amazing.

73
00:01:23,581 --> 00:01:25,356
It looks like you're one-arm boxing.

74
00:01:25,356 --> 00:01:26,684
- Take the Wubble Bubbles.

75
00:01:26,684 --> 00:01:27,517
Holy cow.

76
00:01:27,517 --> 00:01:28,891
Here we go, so now we just have to tear these open.

77
00:01:28,891 --> 00:01:29,808
- [Devan] Wait, what? - [Collins] Pull. Torn.

78
00:01:29,808 --> 00:01:30,641
Alright, so now,

79
00:01:30,641 --> 00:01:31,474
scoop it in.

80
00:01:31,474 --> 00:01:32,565
- I got some. - I didn't.

81
00:01:32,565 --> 00:01:33,640
- I'll hold it open.

82
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,159
You dump it in.

83
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:35,992
- Hold it open, open!

84
00:01:35,992 --> 00:01:36,892
- I got it, I got it, I got it.

85
00:01:36,892 --> 00:01:38,875
Oh, we got it.

86
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:39,708
My arms are getting tired.

87
00:01:39,708 --> 00:01:40,788
- [Collins] Open it up, Devan.

88
00:01:40,788 --> 00:01:41,621
- It's open.

89
00:01:41,621 --> 00:01:42,454
- It's coming in,

90
00:01:42,454 --> 00:01:43,787
okay here we go.

91
00:01:44,988 --> 00:01:45,821
- Ah, jeez man.

92
00:01:45,821 --> 00:01:46,654
- Devan sticking on shirt.

93
00:01:46,654 --> 00:01:47,487
Alright, alright.

94
00:01:47,487 --> 00:01:48,760
- [Devan] Can you just go any faster?

95
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,654
- Alright put it down for a second

96
00:01:49,654 --> 00:01:51,521
I need to take a little rest.

97
00:01:51,521 --> 00:01:52,971
Here it goes. - Dude, it's spilling,

98
00:01:52,971 --> 00:01:53,804
you're spilling.

99
00:01:53,804 --> 00:01:54,637
Ooohhhh.

100
00:01:54,637 --> 00:01:55,470
I can't.

101
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,303
There ya go.

102
00:01:56,303 --> 00:01:57,519
- Okay, well I think that's it

103
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:58,352
for my Wubble Bubble.

104
00:01:58,352 --> 00:01:59,185
So here, this comes out.

105
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:00,846
- Here's your Wubble Bubble con.

106
00:02:00,846 --> 00:02:01,837
- The final step we gotta zip tie

107
00:02:01,837 --> 00:02:02,670
so pull it out Devan, pull it out.

108
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:03,503
- I got it, I got it.

109
00:02:03,503 --> 00:02:04,336
I'm losing grip.

110
00:02:04,336 --> 00:02:05,169
Oh no! - Stop it!

111
00:02:05,169 --> 00:02:06,002
- You got it? - No.

112
00:02:06,002 --> 00:02:06,835
- You got it? - No.

113
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:07,668
Quicker.

114
00:02:07,668 --> 00:02:08,501
- I can't.

115
00:02:08,501 --> 00:02:09,334
- Faster!

116
00:02:09,334 --> 00:02:10,167
Nooo!

117
00:02:10,167 --> 00:02:11,000
(gasps)

118
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,833
- No.

119
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:12,666
- Alright now we just gotta tighten it.

120
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:13,499
- Dude, you got this bro.

121
00:02:13,499 --> 00:02:14,995
I got a full on squeeze.

122
00:02:14,995 --> 00:02:15,923
- Did you say Chihuahua?

123
00:02:15,923 --> 00:02:17,293
Oooohhhhh!

124
00:02:17,293 --> 00:02:18,141
- Zip tie is on!

125
00:02:18,141 --> 00:02:20,105
This thing turned out crazy!

126
00:02:20,105 --> 00:02:21,461
- We just gotta put a fishnet on yours

127
00:02:21,461 --> 00:02:22,294
and we'll be done.

128
00:02:22,294 --> 00:02:23,127
I got it, right here.

129
00:02:23,127 --> 00:02:24,499
- How do we do this, we just pop it around it?

130
00:02:24,499 --> 00:02:25,332
- Yeah, I guess so.

131
00:02:25,332 --> 00:02:26,249
- [Collins] I'll pick it up.

132
00:02:26,249 --> 00:02:27,082
- And just on it.

133
00:02:27,082 --> 00:02:27,915
- [Collins] Like that? That's it?

134
00:02:27,915 --> 00:02:28,748
- Alright, well then -

135
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:29,581
- Dude, you gotta support it!

136
00:02:29,581 --> 00:02:30,414
- You look great.

137
00:02:30,414 --> 00:02:31,549
You look beautiful.

138
00:02:31,549 --> 00:02:32,443
I'm supporting it, Devan.

139
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:33,418
You's the best you!

140
00:02:33,418 --> 00:02:34,251
Ahhhhhhh!

141
00:02:34,251 --> 00:02:35,084
- Yeah!

142
00:02:35,084 --> 00:02:35,917
Are you ready?

143
00:02:35,917 --> 00:02:36,750
- [Devan] Dude, it's stuck to my shirt.

144
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,583
- Grrrrrr.

145
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:40,444
- [Devan] Dude, you got it over here!

146
00:02:40,444 --> 00:02:42,317
- Dude, this thing turned out like galaxies!

147
00:02:42,317 --> 00:02:43,150
Comment down below

148
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:45,062
what color Wubble Bubble should we make next?

149
00:02:45,062 --> 00:02:46,478
And right now it's on to the next one.

150
00:02:46,478 --> 00:02:48,075
Ahhh ha!

151
00:02:48,075 --> 00:02:48,908
For this round, you challenged us

152
00:02:48,908 --> 00:02:50,346
to make a squishy pen stress reliever.

153
00:02:50,346 --> 00:02:51,959
So right now, let's go!

154
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:53,062
Step one, we gotta fill it -

155
00:02:53,062 --> 00:02:53,895
Ow!

156
00:02:53,895 --> 00:02:54,739
A balloon with a little bit of water there.

157
00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:55,572
So here we go.

158
00:02:55,572 --> 00:02:56,405
- [Devan] Wait. What are you doing?

159
00:02:56,405 --> 00:02:57,238
What are you doing?

160
00:02:57,238 --> 00:02:58,071
(laughs)

161
00:02:58,071 --> 00:02:58,904
- [Collins] I almost got you bro.

162
00:02:58,904 --> 00:02:59,737
- So you take the funnel,

163
00:02:59,737 --> 00:03:00,835
you put it in the balloon.

164
00:03:00,835 --> 00:03:01,668
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

165
00:03:01,668 --> 00:03:02,501
Better idea.

166
00:03:02,501 --> 00:03:03,599
- Oh, nope it's not working.

167
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,432
(high-pitched whistle)

168
00:03:04,432 --> 00:03:06,445
Dude, mine actually I think has a leak in it.

169
00:03:06,445 --> 00:03:07,954
I'm dealing with a crisis over here, Collins.

170
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:09,440
Dude, what are you doing?

171
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,273
- Didn't work.

172
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,106
- It got stuck.

173
00:03:11,106 --> 00:03:11,939
- Instead I should pour the water in, Devan.

174
00:03:11,939 --> 00:03:12,772
I think that's a better way of doing it.

175
00:03:12,772 --> 00:03:13,605
- [Devan] Oh, no.

176
00:03:13,605 --> 00:03:14,897
This is gonna be interesting.

177
00:03:14,897 --> 00:03:15,730
- Mmm hmm.

178
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:16,563
- [Devan] Oh. Oh, no.

179
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:17,396
Oh, dude!

180
00:03:17,396 --> 00:03:18,345
Really? Why?

181
00:03:18,345 --> 00:03:19,895
- Well that definitely didn't go according to plan.

182
00:03:19,895 --> 00:03:20,861
- Well, yeah.

183
00:03:20,861 --> 00:03:21,694
Dude!

184
00:03:21,694 --> 00:03:22,527
- Okay, I'm sorry bro, I'm sorry.

185
00:03:22,527 --> 00:03:23,360
Okay, dude. Stop getting it all over me!

186
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,318
- So gross.

187
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:25,151
No, no, no.

188
00:03:25,151 --> 00:03:25,984
No.

189
00:03:25,984 --> 00:03:27,007
I feel like I'm in the splash zone!

190
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:27,840
What? How?

191
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,911
(laughs)

192
00:03:28,911 --> 00:03:30,083
- I did it!

193
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:31,221
It looks a little funky on the back side.

194
00:03:31,221 --> 00:03:32,359
But, like, I did it bro!

195
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:33,192
Wooooo!

196
00:03:33,192 --> 00:03:34,025
Dude, yeah!

197
00:03:34,025 --> 00:03:35,240
- Alright, next up we take another balloon

198
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,073
(loud snap)

199
00:03:36,073 --> 00:03:37,024
and put it around the (glass tinkers) first one.

200
00:03:37,024 --> 00:03:38,749
You gotta just, like, just little, little bit.

201
00:03:38,749 --> 00:03:41,139
Take this here, and stretch it around.

202
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:41,972
- I have a finger in it now.

203
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:42,805
- Okay.

204
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:43,638
Good for you.

205
00:03:43,638 --> 00:03:44,471
- Trying to get this thing on.

206
00:03:44,471 --> 00:03:45,304
How does it work, man?

207
00:03:45,304 --> 00:03:46,304
Oh, my gosh!

208
00:03:47,163 --> 00:03:48,289
Holy cow, that went everywhere.

209
00:03:48,289 --> 00:03:49,122
- What did you do?

210
00:03:49,122 --> 00:03:50,275
- This is more like a water balloon video

211
00:03:50,275 --> 00:03:51,575
versus like a stress reliever video.

212
00:03:51,575 --> 00:03:53,621
Because my stress level is like through the roof right now.

213
00:03:53,621 --> 00:03:54,454
Clean all this up,

214
00:03:54,454 --> 00:03:55,287
- Oh, oh, oh.

215
00:03:55,287 --> 00:03:56,120
- [Collins] Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

216
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,544
- [Devan] Oh, yes, yes, yes.

217
00:03:58,544 --> 00:03:59,377
Look at it.

218
00:03:59,377 --> 00:04:00,377
- [Collins] No way!

219
00:04:00,377 --> 00:04:01,210
- [Devan] Yes. Success!

220
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:02,224
- [Collins] I have no clue how you even did that, bro.

221
00:04:02,224 --> 00:04:03,188
Try squeezing it now.

222
00:04:03,188 --> 00:04:04,021
Try pinching it.

223
00:04:04,021 --> 00:04:05,336
Oh, that's so cool!

224
00:04:05,336 --> 00:04:06,169
Yeah!

225
00:04:06,169 --> 00:04:07,002
(laughter)

226
00:04:07,002 --> 00:04:08,366
- Next up, you attach it to the pen.

227
00:04:08,366 --> 00:04:11,204
All you have to do is just put it on like...

228
00:04:11,204 --> 00:04:12,037
- [Collins] Did you get it?

229
00:04:12,037 --> 00:04:12,870
- [Devan] Yep - [Collins] Nice!

230
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:13,703
- Just like that.

231
00:04:13,703 --> 00:04:14,652
It's also a little lopsided.

232
00:04:14,652 --> 00:04:15,485
And a little crooked.

233
00:04:15,485 --> 00:04:16,318
But you know what?

234
00:04:16,318 --> 00:04:17,151
That's my pen.

235
00:04:17,151 --> 00:04:17,984
It's good...

236
00:04:17,984 --> 00:04:18,817
Nevermind. It's not good for spinning.

237
00:04:18,817 --> 00:04:19,650
Want some help Collins?

238
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:20,483
- Yes, if you could please do this.

239
00:04:20,483 --> 00:04:21,316
- Yeah, I got it.

240
00:04:21,316 --> 00:04:22,804
- In the meantime, I will do very important work.

241
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,654
(air blowing)

242
00:04:24,654 --> 00:04:25,487
(gasp)

243
00:04:25,487 --> 00:04:26,320
It like went back into my lung.

244
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,153
I was like...

245
00:04:27,153 --> 00:04:27,986
(gurgling gasp)

246
00:04:27,986 --> 00:04:28,819
- [Devan] Alright, there we go.

247
00:04:28,819 --> 00:04:29,670
Right there.

248
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:30,503
- Wait, how did you do that?

249
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:31,336
- [Devan] Boom!

250
00:04:31,336 --> 00:04:32,341
You get to comment down below

251
00:04:32,341 --> 00:04:33,432
who won this round

252
00:04:33,432 --> 00:04:34,895
and right now, we are on to the next one!

253
00:04:34,895 --> 00:04:36,068
La, la, la, la, la, la, la.

254
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:36,915
- Ya!

255
00:04:36,915 --> 00:04:37,748
- [Collins] Alright guys, so for this one

256
00:04:37,748 --> 00:04:38,581
we are actually making

257
00:04:38,581 --> 00:04:39,414
(thud)

258
00:04:39,414 --> 00:04:40,247
a giant Nutella.

259
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:41,080
You broke your bucket, Devan!

260
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,973
- [Devan] Ooooh! I broke the bucket!

261
00:04:41,973 --> 00:04:42,806
- This is ridiculous.

262
00:04:42,806 --> 00:04:43,639
Alright, well you know what

263
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:44,472
this is actually a tiny Nutella.

264
00:04:44,472 --> 00:04:45,909
We need to make giant Nutella.

265
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:47,163
Three, two, one.

266
00:04:47,163 --> 00:04:47,996
- What are you doing?

267
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:48,829
- Boom! Oh, my gosh!

268
00:04:48,829 --> 00:04:49,662
- Whoa, dude!

269
00:04:49,662 --> 00:04:50,495
- Oh, and are you ready

270
00:04:50,495 --> 00:04:51,328
for our huge announcement?

271
00:04:51,328 --> 00:04:52,794
We've got merch!

272
00:04:52,794 --> 00:04:54,001

276
00:05:01,103 --> 00:05:01,936

Right now, let's go!

289
00:05:19,436 --> 00:05:20,269
And there it is.

290
00:05:20,269 --> 00:05:21,224
A giant Nutella.

291
00:05:21,224 --> 00:05:22,234
- Where's mine dude? Can I have one?

292
00:05:22,234 --> 00:05:23,067
- [Collins] Oh, just go like this,

293
00:05:23,067 --> 00:05:24,041
hold out your hand, - [Devan] Okay.

294
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,288
- Three, two, one.

295
00:05:25,288 --> 00:05:26,163
(crickets)

296
00:05:26,163 --> 00:05:26,996
- I don't think this worked.

297
00:05:26,996 --> 00:05:28,044
It's like the same size. - Oh, that's why.

298
00:05:28,044 --> 00:05:28,877
I have a little Minion in there.

299
00:05:28,877 --> 00:05:30,035
(thud) - What?

300
00:05:30,035 --> 00:05:31,025
- Now that we've got that all cleared out, here we go,

301
00:05:31,025 --> 00:05:32,271
three, two, one,

302
00:05:32,271 --> 00:05:33,456
boom, there we go. Oh, snap!

303
00:05:33,456 --> 00:05:34,786
So right now let's make some Nutella.

304
00:05:34,786 --> 00:05:35,633
So first things first,

305
00:05:35,633 --> 00:05:36,481
we got some glue.

306
00:05:36,481 --> 00:05:37,314
- Cheers!

307
00:05:37,314 --> 00:05:38,147
- Oh!

308
00:05:38,147 --> 00:05:38,980
Here we go, just dump it out.

309
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:39,813
- How much?

310
00:05:39,813 --> 00:05:40,646
- [Collins] All of it bro!

311
00:05:40,646 --> 00:05:41,479
(laughter)

312
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:42,312
(grunts)

313
00:05:42,312 --> 00:05:43,522
- Next up we got the stuff

314
00:05:43,522 --> 00:05:44,642
oh, hoo-hoo!

315
00:05:44,642 --> 00:05:45,475
You know what, Devan

316
00:05:45,475 --> 00:05:46,308
I actually have a different idea.

317
00:05:46,308 --> 00:05:47,141
- I'm gonna put the paint in first.

318
00:05:47,141 --> 00:05:47,974
- Oh.

319
00:05:47,974 --> 00:05:48,807
- [Collins] Because it's gonna give it a Nutella look.

320
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:49,664
- [Devan] Whoa, nice!

321
00:05:49,664 --> 00:05:50,497
I'm gonna squeeze...

322
00:05:50,497 --> 00:05:51,330
- Oh!

323
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:52,780
- every last drop out of mine.

324
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:53,613
- Oh, Jesus it's getting kinda

325
00:05:53,613 --> 00:05:54,589
funky!

326
00:05:54,589 --> 00:05:55,422
- Ah.

327
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:56,255
- [Devan] Look at mine!

328
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:57,126
It looks so cool.

329
00:05:57,126 --> 00:05:58,780
It's like some sort of chocolate dessert.

330
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,307
- Whip it through the sauce boy!

331
00:06:00,307 --> 00:06:01,717
- Do we have more acrylic paint Collins?

332
00:06:01,717 --> 00:06:05,340
(suspenseful music)

333
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,173
- No.

334
00:06:06,173 --> 00:06:07,042
- Ah, I dropped my spatula.

335
00:06:07,042 --> 00:06:07,875
- [Collins] Noooo!

336
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:08,708
Why'd you drop your spatuala?

337
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:09,541
- No!

338
00:06:09,541 --> 00:06:10,374
- Well, we were able to find more acrylics

339
00:06:10,374 --> 00:06:12,156
but Devan you lost your whole spatula, bro.

340
00:06:12,156 --> 00:06:12,989
- [Devan] This is bad.

341
00:06:12,989 --> 00:06:13,822
- [Collins] Here we go.

342
00:06:13,822 --> 00:06:14,655
So now we're gonna mix this in

343
00:06:14,655 --> 00:06:15,488
and hopefully this will actually

344
00:06:15,488 --> 00:06:16,321
turn it a little bit darker

345
00:06:16,321 --> 00:06:17,154
because right now it's too light.

346
00:06:17,154 --> 00:06:17,987
- [Devan] Milky looking, I guess.

347
00:06:17,987 --> 00:06:18,884
- Alright now that we've mixed it all up,

348
00:06:18,884 --> 00:06:20,736
it is time to add the Sta-Flo.

349
00:06:20,736 --> 00:06:21,569
That's a lot.

350
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:22,402
- Oh!

351
00:06:22,402 --> 00:06:23,235
I got it on my shirt.

352
00:06:23,235 --> 00:06:24,068
- Oh, no!

353
00:06:24,068 --> 00:06:24,901
Dude!

354
00:06:24,901 --> 00:06:25,978
This is gonna be so cool!

355
00:06:25,978 --> 00:06:26,811
- I know.

356
00:06:26,811 --> 00:06:27,644
- You know what,

357
00:06:27,644 --> 00:06:28,799
I don't think this little spatula is gonna do it,

358
00:06:28,799 --> 00:06:30,407
I think I might have to get my hands in here, man.

359
00:06:30,407 --> 00:06:31,255
- Yep, I'm going for it.

360
00:06:31,255 --> 00:06:33,554
- Oh, this is one of the weirdest feeling ones yet.

361
00:06:33,554 --> 00:06:34,802
- It's super cold, too.

362
00:06:34,802 --> 00:06:35,635
- Wooo!

363
00:06:35,635 --> 00:06:36,468
- Wooo!

364
00:06:36,468 --> 00:06:37,301
- [Collins] I like, feels kinda like Nutella in a way,

365
00:06:37,301 --> 00:06:39,231
like it's kinda like all melty, chocolatey.

366
00:06:39,231 --> 00:06:40,064
I just want to clarify,

367
00:06:40,064 --> 00:06:41,083
this stuff is not edible.

368
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:42,737
- Wait, Collins. Where did you put your spatula?

369
00:06:42,737 --> 00:06:43,570
- I don't know.

370
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,403
Wait a minute.

371
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:45,236
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

372
00:06:45,236 --> 00:06:46,102
- What, what?

373
00:06:46,102 --> 00:06:46,935
- There it is.

374
00:06:46,935 --> 00:06:48,625
Well, my Nutella is turning out a little stringy.

375
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:49,458
- [Devan] Yeah.

376
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:50,291
- Gloopy, globby.

377
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:51,124
This requires my patented technique.

378
00:06:51,124 --> 00:06:52,689
The hand over hand over hand over hand.

379
00:06:52,689 --> 00:06:54,465
- This is so much slime.

380
00:06:54,465 --> 00:06:55,510
I just gotta get in there bro.

381
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,367
It's like you're massaging mud.

382
00:06:57,367 --> 00:06:58,200
- What?

383
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,033
Why would you ever massage mud?

384
00:06:59,033 --> 00:06:59,866
- You wouldn't.

385
00:06:59,866 --> 00:07:00,699
And that's the point.

386
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:02,040
- Ready when it says slime is in the workout,

387
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,873
you's wrong.

388
00:07:02,873 --> 00:07:03,968
That should be an exercise class.

389
00:07:03,968 --> 00:07:04,937
Like instead of pilates,

390
00:07:04,937 --> 00:07:06,063
it's called si-lates.

391
00:07:06,063 --> 00:07:07,514
Slime pilates.

392
00:07:07,514 --> 00:07:08,347
I know what they do in pilates.

393
00:07:08,347 --> 00:07:09,691
Ooomph-ooomph, ooomph-ooomph.

394
00:07:09,691 --> 00:07:10,524
- Could get behind it.

395
00:07:10,524 --> 00:07:11,746
- Oh, it's starting to come together nicely.

396
00:07:11,746 --> 00:07:12,579
- Oooooh!

397
00:07:12,579 --> 00:07:13,598
- [Collins] Yours is actually working out very well.

398
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:14,431
Way better than mine.

399
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,264
- Well yeah, because I'm standing up.

400
00:07:15,264 --> 00:07:16,097
- Oh, that's the move.

401
00:07:16,097 --> 00:07:16,930
- It's the key.

402
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:17,763
(bell chime)

403
00:07:17,763 --> 00:07:18,672
- Collins Key.

404
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:19,505
- No, no.

405
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:20,338
Devan Key.

406
00:07:20,338 --> 00:07:21,171
- Oh, man.

407
00:07:21,171 --> 00:07:22,004
Collins Key.

408
00:07:22,004 --> 00:07:22,837
- Devan Key.

409
00:07:22,837 --> 00:07:23,670
- Collins Key.

410
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:24,503
- For the final time,

411
00:07:24,503 --> 00:07:25,336
Devan Key.

412
00:07:25,336 --> 00:07:26,169
- Collins Key. Shoot!

413
00:07:26,169 --> 00:07:27,002
- Yes, I got it!

414
00:07:27,002 --> 00:07:28,386
Confirmed. Devan Key.

415
00:07:28,386 --> 00:07:29,460
Ahhhhh! (splat) - Whoa!

416
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,293
- [Collins] Devan, slime pilates

417
00:07:30,293 --> 00:07:31,959
are getting out of control, man.

418
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:32,792
- Squeeshy, squeeshy.

419
00:07:32,792 --> 00:07:33,625
- I call this The Pulverizer.

420
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:34,458
(rapid thuds)

421
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:35,291
Done.

422
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:36,124
- That's intense.

423
00:07:36,124 --> 00:07:37,074
Oooh, my god.

424
00:07:37,074 --> 00:07:37,907
Our slimes are mixing!

425
00:07:37,907 --> 00:07:38,740
- Dude, what are you doing?

426
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,573
Yes, we gotta get more of yours.

427
00:07:39,573 --> 00:07:40,406
- No! Devan, Devan!

428
00:07:40,406 --> 00:07:41,239
Oh, my!

429
00:07:41,239 --> 00:07:42,072
- Yes!

430
00:07:42,072 --> 00:07:42,905
I want...

431
00:07:42,905 --> 00:07:43,891
- Jeez, I got it all over me, man.

432
00:07:43,891 --> 00:07:44,724
What are you doing?

433
00:07:44,724 --> 00:07:45,717
- I will have the best slime.

434
00:07:45,717 --> 00:07:46,550
- Here we go,

435
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,383
time to...

436
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:48,216
- Nope, nope, nope.

437
00:07:48,216 --> 00:07:49,061
I will give you your portion.

438
00:07:49,061 --> 00:07:49,894
(rubbery snap)

439
00:07:49,894 --> 00:07:50,727
- Are you ki...

440
00:07:50,727 --> 00:07:51,560
- There you go.

441
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,562
This is a happy day, guys.

442
00:07:52,562 --> 00:07:53,694
Whoa! No, no, no.

443
00:07:53,694 --> 00:07:55,302
Why would you, noooo!

444
00:07:55,302 --> 00:07:56,271
I didn't think this through.

445
00:07:56,271 --> 00:07:57,104
- Here we go.

446
00:07:57,104 --> 00:07:57,937
Alright, just gonna drop it in.

447
00:07:57,937 --> 00:07:58,770
(rapid gurgle)

448
00:07:58,770 --> 00:07:59,603
Come on, no!

449
00:07:59,603 --> 00:08:00,436
- Redirection.

450
00:08:00,436 --> 00:08:01,269
- No, no, no.

451
00:08:01,269 --> 00:08:02,102
Devan, Devan, dude give it back.

452
00:08:02,102 --> 00:08:02,935
- [Devan] It's going in mine.

453
00:08:02,935 --> 00:08:03,768
- No, it can't even fit.

454
00:08:03,768 --> 00:08:04,601
I just want something.

455
00:08:04,601 --> 00:08:05,576
(laughter)

456
00:08:05,576 --> 00:08:06,609
You just pulled it right out, bro.

457
00:08:06,609 --> 00:08:07,442
Stop.

458
00:08:07,442 --> 00:08:08,275
- Am I not good at this, or what?

459
00:08:08,275 --> 00:08:09,299
- Go in! (rapid thud)

460
00:08:09,299 --> 00:08:10,132
Faster!

461
00:08:10,132 --> 00:08:10,965
He'll get you.

462
00:08:10,965 --> 00:08:11,798
- Alright, mine's all done.

463
00:08:11,798 --> 00:08:12,631
Look at it. Look at it.

464
00:08:12,631 --> 00:08:13,464
Mine totally fits,

465
00:08:13,464 --> 00:08:14,889
put the lid on it.

466
00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:15,722
(bang)

467
00:08:15,722 --> 00:08:16,928
- Yo, so the Nutella slimes are done.

468
00:08:16,928 --> 00:08:17,761
- It's so heavy.

469
00:08:17,761 --> 00:08:18,594
- That's super cool!

470
00:08:18,594 --> 00:08:19,987
And now you can be like sitting in class

471
00:08:19,987 --> 00:08:21,601
just pulling out like, yeet!

472
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:24,504
- Whoa! It like twisted up when you take the cap off.

473
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,337
- [Collins] That's awesome!

474
00:08:25,337 --> 00:08:26,287
You get to comment down below

475
00:08:26,287 --> 00:08:27,814
who made better Nutella slime

476
00:08:27,814 --> 00:08:29,707
and right now we are on to the next round.

477
00:08:29,707 --> 00:08:30,833
What is happening?

478
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:31,666
For this round we are making

479
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:32,499
squishy soap.

480
00:08:32,499 --> 00:08:33,332
- [Devan] That's a squishy?

481
00:08:33,332 --> 00:08:34,375
- No, no. This is not squishy.

482
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:35,664
But this, is squishy.

483
00:08:35,664 --> 00:08:36,497
- Okay.

484
00:08:36,497 --> 00:08:37,434
- Yo dude, look at it!

485
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:38,267
- What?

486
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:39,408
- And thank you to Soozooya for the original recipe.

487
00:08:39,408 --> 00:08:40,615
I've linked her channel down below.

488
00:08:40,615 --> 00:08:42,067
And right now, here's how you make it.

489
00:08:42,067 --> 00:08:43,477
We're kicking it off right now with a cup of flour,

490
00:08:43,477 --> 00:08:44,563
(light thuds)

491
00:08:44,563 --> 00:08:46,014
- Oh. Dude, what are you doing?

492
00:08:46,014 --> 00:08:46,847
- Ehhh!

493
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,680
- Ahhh!

494
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,513
- Alright, so the first step here

495
00:08:48,513 --> 00:08:49,346
we got some glutinous rice.

496
00:08:49,346 --> 00:08:50,179
- Now you do a half a cup of soap.

497
00:08:50,179 --> 00:08:51,012
(clapping)

498
00:08:51,012 --> 00:08:51,845
- Long shot.

499
00:08:51,845 --> 00:08:52,678
- Did you know that

500
00:08:52,678 --> 00:08:54,112
you don't actually have to use this dispenser?

501
00:08:54,112 --> 00:08:56,567
You can actually just push it out the top like this.

502
00:08:56,567 --> 00:08:57,856
- Whoa, it's like a thumb workout!

503
00:08:57,856 --> 00:08:58,866
Oh, man hold on,

504
00:08:58,866 --> 00:08:59,789
I'm like in the middle of my reps, bro.

505
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:00,799
(panting)

506
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:01,632
Uh-oh.

507
00:09:01,632 --> 00:09:02,465
I think I went a little too much.

508
00:09:02,465 --> 00:09:03,298
Oops.

509
00:09:03,298 --> 00:09:04,131
For something that's supposed to be so clean,

510
00:09:04,131 --> 00:09:05,588
I'm sure making a mess with some soap right now.

511
00:09:05,588 --> 00:09:06,720
- [Devan] Here we go, oh yeah.

512
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,553
- Oh.

513
00:09:07,553 --> 00:09:09,176
That's a brand new type of bizarre feeling.

514
00:09:09,176 --> 00:09:10,987
It's like oobleck, but like runny.

515
00:09:10,987 --> 00:09:12,961
- Mine looks like feta cheese, bro.

516
00:09:12,961 --> 00:09:13,808
- Pew, pew, pew, pew.

517
00:09:13,808 --> 00:09:14,641
Alright, well I think

518
00:09:14,641 --> 00:09:16,026
it's starting to get to the right consistency now.

519
00:09:16,026 --> 00:09:17,274
- Mine is going good.

520
00:09:17,274 --> 00:09:18,522
- Alright, we need some more rice powder,

521
00:09:18,522 --> 00:09:20,252
- Bro, can you keep it inside the bowl?

522
00:09:20,252 --> 00:09:21,297
- It is inside the bo...

523
00:09:21,297 --> 00:09:22,130
- No it's not.

524
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:23,108
- Why does my hand look like this

525
00:09:23,108 --> 00:09:24,005
and your hand looks like that?

526
00:09:24,005 --> 00:09:25,946
- Alright, next up for me is some food coloring.

527
00:09:25,946 --> 00:09:26,779
(thud)

528
00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:28,279
- The color I'm gonna add is purple first.

529
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:29,112
Whoa!

530
00:09:29,112 --> 00:09:29,945
- That looks so cool!

531
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:30,778
- [Together] Ooooh!

532
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:31,786
- [Collins] Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.

533
00:09:31,786 --> 00:09:32,619
Oh, dude!

534
00:09:32,619 --> 00:09:34,206
- Why?

535
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:35,617
- I think I like legit ruined it, bro.

536
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:36,450
(clap)

537
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,283
- We got some gloves

538
00:09:37,283 --> 00:09:38,116
so right now we're going to do these.

539
00:09:38,116 --> 00:09:39,564
I gotta go over here so I don't spill it everywhere.

540
00:09:39,564 --> 00:09:40,853
Oh, yep. It's getting all over my gloves.

541
00:09:40,853 --> 00:09:43,187
Boom! Plum number one is done.

542
00:09:43,187 --> 00:09:44,020
- Whoa, wait.

543
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:44,853
It's a plum now?

544
00:09:44,853 --> 00:09:46,333
What are you making now?

545
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:47,166
What is that?

546
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:47,999
- Now that we've got the balls made,

547
00:09:47,999 --> 00:09:49,032
it's time to shape them into our fruit.

548
00:09:49,032 --> 00:09:49,996
So Devan, what fruit...

549
00:09:49,996 --> 00:09:50,829
- Oh, oop. Ahh.

550
00:09:50,829 --> 00:09:51,685
I tried to psych you out.

551
00:09:51,685 --> 00:09:53,421
Basically, I'm starting out with a ball.

552
00:09:53,421 --> 00:09:55,191
This is the sweet part of the watermelon.

553
00:09:55,191 --> 00:09:57,159
And I'm gonna wrap it around with the green

554
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:58,245
just like that.

555
00:09:58,245 --> 00:09:59,737
- So I'm gonna start constructing mine right now.

556
00:09:59,737 --> 00:10:01,066
Gonna place these two pieces like this.

557
00:10:01,066 --> 00:10:01,899
Boom.

558
00:10:01,899 --> 00:10:02,958
I'm just gonna mush these together right now.

559
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:04,973
- Alright, I have my first half of the watermelon.

560
00:10:04,973 --> 00:10:06,464
What are you doing? (clatter)

561
00:10:06,464 --> 00:10:07,297
Dude. - Oops.

562
00:10:07,297 --> 00:10:08,130
Now the bowls of our fruits are made.

563
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:09,104
It's time to steam these for 15 minutes,

564
00:10:09,104 --> 00:10:09,937
so right now...

565
00:10:09,937 --> 00:10:10,793
- Dude, these turned out pretty cool.

566
00:10:10,793 --> 00:10:11,626
- The soaps are done

567
00:10:11,626 --> 00:10:12,459
and now it's time to test them out.

568
00:10:12,459 --> 00:10:13,292
So to do this, we got our hands

569
00:10:13,292 --> 00:10:14,550
a little bit dirty. - Yep.

570
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,030
- So first we gotta kind of dunk them in the water.

571
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:16,904
- Oh, you do? (splash)

572
00:10:16,904 --> 00:10:17,737
- [Together] Oh!

573
00:10:17,737 --> 00:10:18,836
- [Devan] I'm just gonna place mine in the water.

574
00:10:18,836 --> 00:10:20,043
- That's probably a smart idea.

575
00:10:20,043 --> 00:10:22,387
- [Devan] Oh, this is nice, bro.

576
00:10:22,387 --> 00:10:23,220
- And because it was just steamed,

577
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,589
it's like nice and warm, bro.

578
00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:25,422
Oh!

579
00:10:25,422 --> 00:10:26,855
- Dude, like the seeds on the outside

580
00:10:26,855 --> 00:10:28,428
are taking off all the dirt.

581
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:29,316
- I forgot about my bottle caps.

582
00:10:29,316 --> 00:10:30,443
Those are not working in there.

583
00:10:30,443 --> 00:10:31,650
- Whoa, dude. That's the table.

584
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,061
- Yo, this is actually pretty legit.

585
00:10:33,061 --> 00:10:33,984
Comment down below.

586
00:10:33,984 --> 00:10:34,817
Who made a better soap?

587
00:10:34,817 --> 00:10:35,938
I think mine isn't working on my hands

588
00:10:35,938 --> 00:10:37,104
because of all the bottle caps maybe.

589
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:38,799
So right now we are on to the next round.

590
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:39,632
Pop quiz.

591
00:10:39,632 --> 00:10:40,465
Which is the banana, Devan,

592
00:10:40,465 --> 00:10:41,298
and which is a squishy pen?

593
00:10:41,298 --> 00:10:43,345
- Uh, this is obviously a squishy pen.

594
00:10:43,345 --> 00:10:44,178
- Sike!

595
00:10:44,178 --> 00:10:45,011
Trick question.

596
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:45,844
Check it out, bro.

597
00:10:45,844 --> 00:10:46,677
- [Devan] Whoa!

598
00:10:46,677 --> 00:10:48,418
- [Collins] It's actually a banana pen part two.

599
00:10:48,418 --> 00:10:49,251
Yeet!

600
00:10:49,251 --> 00:10:50,084
So right now we're gonna show

601
00:10:50,084 --> 00:10:50,917
you how to make this awesome

602
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:52,149
squishy banana pen.

603
00:10:52,149 --> 00:10:52,982
To kick it off

604
00:10:52,982 --> 00:10:54,131
we need to poke some holes in some foam.

605
00:10:54,131 --> 00:10:54,964
(thump)

606
00:10:54,964 --> 00:10:55,797
- Ahh!

607
00:10:55,797 --> 00:10:56,630
We got this thingy here.

608
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,463
- Okay, yes.

609
00:10:57,463 --> 00:10:58,296
- Ready? - Yes.

610
00:10:58,296 --> 00:10:59,129
- So now we're gonna poke a hole in the foam.

611
00:10:59,129 --> 00:10:59,962
Whoa.

612
00:10:59,962 --> 00:11:00,795
So nice.

613
00:11:00,795 --> 00:11:01,628
Next up you grab a pen.

614
00:11:01,628 --> 00:11:02,461
(metallic slice)

615
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:03,294
Excuse my reach.

616
00:11:03,294 --> 00:11:04,127
I got a pen.

617
00:11:04,127 --> 00:11:04,960
- Oh, man I broke it, I broke mine.

618
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,611
Next step, you put this inside the hole.

619
00:11:06,611 --> 00:11:07,671
- Or you go for the quick technique,

620
00:11:07,671 --> 00:11:08,504
- Oh - It's called

621
00:11:08,504 --> 00:11:09,553
the ah-chew.

622
00:11:09,553 --> 00:11:11,011
Ah-chew! And then it...

623
00:11:11,011 --> 00:11:12,012
- You missed! - I was way off.

624
00:11:12,012 --> 00:11:12,859
No, dude you...

625
00:11:12,859 --> 00:11:13,945
I plugged the hole.

626
00:11:13,945 --> 00:11:14,955
You like sucked my thumb in.

627
00:11:14,955 --> 00:11:16,312
Dude, look at it, look at it, look at it.

628
00:11:16,312 --> 00:11:17,145
Oh, my gosh!

629
00:11:17,145 --> 00:11:17,978
Ahhhhh!

630
00:11:17,978 --> 00:11:18,811
(laughter)

631
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:19,644
- Dual me, bro. Dual me!

632
00:11:19,644 --> 00:11:20,477
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

633
00:11:20,477 --> 00:11:21,310
- Toot. - Ack.

634
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:22,815
- Whoop. What ya. Guh.

635
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:23,648
- I'm just gonna use this

636
00:11:23,648 --> 00:11:24,481
and kind of bend it

637
00:11:24,481 --> 00:11:25,351
because the fruit I'm making

638
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,199
is a little bit bendy.

639
00:11:26,199 --> 00:11:27,032
Can you guess what it is?

640
00:11:27,032 --> 00:11:28,451
So I gotta add a little curve to mine.

641
00:11:28,451 --> 00:11:30,628
- [Devan] Whoa, look at this!

642
00:11:30,628 --> 00:11:31,714
This is so cool.

643
00:11:31,714 --> 00:11:32,724
- Wait, it works so well.

644
00:11:32,724 --> 00:11:33,557
- It goes right through it.

645
00:11:33,557 --> 00:11:34,390
Vigorous filing.

646
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,223
- Yeet.

647
00:11:35,223 --> 00:11:36,056
(thump) (clank)

648
00:11:36,056 --> 00:11:36,889
- Oh!

649
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:38,213
You marked the paint.

650
00:11:38,213 --> 00:11:39,220
- Dude! - Why?

651
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,161
- Oh, we're gonna be in trouble for that one.

652
00:11:40,161 --> 00:11:40,994
I gotta fix this.

653
00:11:40,994 --> 00:11:41,827
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

654
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:43,235
Not a good idea. - Why not?

655
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:44,134
It'll like, it'll like, it'll like

656
00:11:44,134 --> 00:11:44,967
you know, like,

657
00:11:44,967 --> 00:11:45,800
uhhh.

658
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,734
Well if I can't use a pen, yeet! Then I gotta use...

659
00:11:46,734 --> 00:11:49,231
- Why? You just made a mark on the wall.

660
00:11:49,231 --> 00:11:50,403
- Here we go, got all my files.

661
00:11:50,403 --> 00:11:51,611
Look at how fast this is going.

662
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:53,021
- Look at how jagged it is though.

663
00:11:53,021 --> 00:11:54,147
- Well, I can smooth that out.

664
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:55,721
A lot of foam particles in the air right now.

665
00:11:55,721 --> 00:11:56,847
Now that we've shaped our foam,

666
00:11:56,847 --> 00:11:57,694
it's time to paint them.

667
00:11:57,694 --> 00:11:59,024
So now we're going to place them down here.

668
00:11:59,024 --> 00:11:59,947
- [Devan] Alright, I've painted

669
00:11:59,947 --> 00:12:01,520
the orange bit of my carrot now.

670
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,849
- Gonna do this a little bit differently than Deven did.

671
00:12:02,849 --> 00:12:04,219
I'm just gonna put a whole bunch of paint on it,

672
00:12:04,219 --> 00:12:05,583
and then I'm going to take a finger

673
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:06,431
actually sike.

674
00:12:06,431 --> 00:12:07,598
- It looks like mustard.

675
00:12:07,598 --> 00:12:08,602
- Yeah, it does but here we go.

676
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:09,972
I'm gonna use a file to spread it around

677
00:12:09,972 --> 00:12:10,860
and it will smooth it out

678
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,580
at the same time that I'm painting it.

679
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,481
- This is brilliant.

680
00:12:13,481 --> 00:12:14,811
- I think my carrot is done now.

681
00:12:14,811 --> 00:12:17,069
I mean, it's got the little stemmy thingies on there.

682
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:20,521
- Now my banana looks like a yellow banana.

683
00:12:20,521 --> 00:12:21,354
Time to let these dry

684
00:12:21,354 --> 00:12:22,187
and we'll be finding out whether or not

685
00:12:22,187 --> 00:12:23,928
these actually relieve stress once they're done.

686
00:12:23,928 --> 00:12:24,761
Here's the big reveal.

687
00:12:24,761 --> 00:12:26,262
- [Together] Three, two, one,

688
00:12:26,262 --> 00:12:27,109
ta-da!

689
00:12:27,109 --> 00:12:28,038
- Oh, my gosh.

690
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:30,012
Well guys, these foam pens turned out awesome

691
00:12:30,012 --> 00:12:30,845
and now, - Dude.

692
00:12:30,845 --> 00:12:31,701
- The moment you've all been waiting for.

693
00:12:31,701 --> 00:12:32,534
- I love the googly eyes.

694
00:12:32,534 --> 00:12:33,593
- Gotta see if they write.

695
00:12:33,593 --> 00:12:34,842
Oh, dude!

696
00:12:34,842 --> 00:12:35,675
This is awesome!

697
00:12:35,675 --> 00:12:36,531
Well you guys get to comment down below.

698
00:12:36,531 --> 00:12:38,376
Who made a better squishy foam pen?

699
00:12:38,376 --> 00:12:40,349
And right now, we are on to the next round.

700
00:12:40,349 --> 00:12:41,435
This round, (clatter) oh, my gosh,

701
00:12:41,435 --> 00:12:43,206
you challenged us to make a zen island.

702
00:12:43,206 --> 00:12:44,039
What are you doing?

703
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:45,185
So right now let's do this.

704
00:12:45,185 --> 00:12:46,874
Dude, I get it.

705
00:12:46,874 --> 00:12:47,707
So I'm actually going to start off

706
00:12:47,707 --> 00:12:48,540
with a little bit of rocks here.

707
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,373
- So am I.

708
00:12:49,373 --> 00:12:50,206
- [Collins] Here we go, just going

709
00:12:50,206 --> 00:12:51,039
to pour them around the bottom.

710
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:51,872
- [Devan] Yep, put them all around the side.

711
00:12:51,872 --> 00:12:52,755
- Alright, just gonna add the blue. (gasp)

712
00:12:52,755 --> 00:12:53,588
Dude - What?

713
00:12:53,588 --> 00:12:54,421
- I can use a straw to mix it around.

714
00:12:54,421 --> 00:12:55,254
- Oh, oh.

715
00:12:55,254 --> 00:12:56,087
- Ooooh.

716
00:12:56,087 --> 00:12:57,370
Be very careful how I do this.

717
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:58,203
Uh-oh, missed it. No!

718
00:12:58,203 --> 00:12:59,171
- [Devan] Whoa!

719
00:12:59,171 --> 00:13:00,004
- Uh-oh.

720
00:13:00,004 --> 00:13:00,837
- Oh, no.

721
00:13:00,837 --> 00:13:01,670
- So we gotta put sand in there.

722
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:02,503
- [Devan] Got my sand.

723
00:13:02,503 --> 00:13:03,336
- My island looks like

724
00:13:03,336 --> 00:13:04,285
it's about to submerge into the ocean.

725
00:13:04,285 --> 00:13:05,330
- [Devan] Kind of smooth it out.

726
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:07,147
Pat it down, pat it down, pat it down.

727
00:13:07,147 --> 00:13:07,980
- So next up

728
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:08,917
we got some fishes that we gotta add in here.

729
00:13:08,917 --> 00:13:09,750
A little bit of fishy.

730
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:10,583
- [Devan] Do they float?

731
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:11,416
Oh.

732
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,249
- [Collins] We got a pink whale.

733
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:13,215
That's definitely not in the ocean.

734
00:13:13,215 --> 00:13:14,470
- Well the pink whale is actually living on the beach.

735
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,317
He got a little sunburned.

736
00:13:15,317 --> 00:13:16,525
He's just out there like ow.

737
00:13:16,525 --> 00:13:18,423
Got a funny little hat for my little whale.

738
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:19,256
You know what,

739
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:20,472
I think need actually a little bit more sand.

740
00:13:20,472 --> 00:13:21,305
So, uh,

741
00:13:21,305 --> 00:13:22,138
I know how to make some sand.

742
00:13:22,138 --> 00:13:23,661
Boom! We got the huge rock and we got the mallet.

743
00:13:23,661 --> 00:13:24,671
So, let's make some sand.

744
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:25,757
(tinking)

745
00:13:25,757 --> 00:13:26,590
- Uh, Collins,

746
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,334
I have more sand right here if you want some.

747
00:13:28,334 --> 00:13:29,167
- Oh.

748
00:13:29,167 --> 00:13:30,633
- I'm gonna add my palm trees in.

749
00:13:30,633 --> 00:13:31,466
Ta-da!

750
00:13:31,466 --> 00:13:32,525
- Gotta have a palm tree up front.

751
00:13:32,525 --> 00:13:33,358
They're going to be submerged.

752
00:13:33,358 --> 00:13:34,621
They're going to be palm bushes.

753
00:13:34,621 --> 00:13:35,706
Oh, snap!

754
00:13:35,706 --> 00:13:36,539
We got a little house!

755
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:37,372
(laughter)

756
00:13:37,372 --> 00:13:38,205
You know what,

757
00:13:38,205 --> 00:13:39,038
I'm just gonna dump all my little friends in here.

758
00:13:39,038 --> 00:13:39,871
- Ah. Starfish!

759
00:13:39,871 --> 00:13:41,384
You don't think you've added too much, Collins?

760
00:13:41,384 --> 00:13:42,754
- No, I think this is very zen,

761
00:13:42,754 --> 00:13:44,327
very minimalist kind of garden.

762
00:13:44,327 --> 00:13:45,296
- [Devan] Alright, now it is time

763
00:13:45,296 --> 00:13:46,625
to smooth out my garden.

764
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:47,458
Ooooh!

765
00:13:48,315 --> 00:13:49,888
That is quite satisfying.

766
00:13:49,888 --> 00:13:51,130
- Because this is a zen garden to the max,

767
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,425
I'm gonna need something to smooth it out.

768
00:13:52,425 --> 00:13:53,258
These little things right here,

769
00:13:53,258 --> 00:13:54,834
they will not be able to smooth out

770
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:55,667
the magnitude

771
00:13:55,667 --> 00:13:56,659
of what I've got going on.

772
00:13:56,659 --> 00:13:58,357
- So to do that, I'm gonna need a little friend.

773
00:13:58,357 --> 00:13:59,190
Check this out.

774
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:00,092
Bam, there we go!

775
00:14:00,092 --> 00:14:00,940
- [Devan] How are you gonna?

776
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,066
Oh, my goodness.

777
00:14:02,066 --> 00:14:03,517
What is going on?

778
00:14:03,517 --> 00:14:04,446
Well, I guess that actually,

779
00:14:04,446 --> 00:14:05,279
that works.

780
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,135
Because you removed everything

781
00:14:06,135 --> 00:14:07,784
that was blocking the zen garden.

782
00:14:07,784 --> 00:14:09,880
- I think this is pretty close

783
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,713
and yeah I'd say that,

784
00:14:10,713 --> 00:14:11,546
oh, geez.

785
00:14:11,546 --> 00:14:12,379
That about does it.

786
00:14:12,379 --> 00:14:13,212
- Do you feel zen?

787
00:14:13,212 --> 00:14:14,045
Because I don't.

788
00:14:14,045 --> 00:14:14,878
- I feel very zen right now.

789
00:14:14,878 --> 00:14:16,045
So you guys get to comment down below.

790
00:14:16,045 --> 00:14:17,050
Who won this round

791
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:19,151
and right now we are on to the next one.

792
00:14:19,151 --> 00:14:21,321
This round you challenged us to make a squishy pen,

793
00:14:21,321 --> 00:14:22,972
so we're literally going to be doing some crazy stuff.

794
00:14:22,972 --> 00:14:23,899
And right now, here's how you make it.

795
00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:24,732
Wee hee!

796
00:14:24,732 --> 00:14:25,565
(shatter) - Whoa.

797
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:26,689
I'm actually gonna paint my pen.

798
00:14:26,689 --> 00:14:27,522
- Wait, that's not fair. - Why?

799
00:14:27,522 --> 00:14:28,446
- You're like a legit artist.

800
00:14:28,446 --> 00:14:29,905
Devan does like celebrity portraits and stuff.

801
00:14:29,905 --> 00:14:30,956
So instead of painting it,

802
00:14:30,956 --> 00:14:31,920
I want a rainbow pen.

803
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,168
You know how you find a rainbow pen?

804
00:14:33,168 --> 00:14:34,001
At the end of a rainbow.

805
00:14:34,001 --> 00:14:34,834
So, ummmm...

806
00:14:34,834 --> 00:14:35,667
- What?

807
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:36,500
- Ah.

808
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,705
(magical music)

809
00:14:38,705 --> 00:14:40,400
Yo, dude! It actually worked! - What?

810
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,050
- That's never happened before. It's only gold coins,

811
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:44,018
where's the actual pen?

812
00:14:44,018 --> 00:14:45,428
Ah-ha! Here's the pen!

813
00:14:45,428 --> 00:14:46,880
Three, two, one.

814
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,713
(Thump)

815
00:14:47,713 --> 00:14:48,546
Well, that's done

816
00:14:48,546 --> 00:14:49,379
so now we have a pen

817
00:14:49,379 --> 00:14:50,347
and I guess my only next step...

818
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:51,316
- Nope, nope, nope.

819
00:14:51,316 --> 00:14:52,149
- My coins.

820
00:14:52,149 --> 00:14:52,982
Yaaaay!

821
00:14:52,982 --> 00:14:53,815
(cheers)

822
00:14:53,815 --> 00:14:54,741
I'm actually going to try to glue

823
00:14:54,741 --> 00:14:56,560
some of these little squishies to my pen.

824
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,557
Here, this gold coin is for you.

825
00:14:57,557 --> 00:14:58,856
(swoosh) (disappointing music)

826
00:14:58,856 --> 00:14:59,689
That was weak.

827
00:14:59,689 --> 00:15:00,522
- You know what Collins, I'm actually

828
00:15:00,522 --> 00:15:01,832
not gonna paint my pen anymore.

829
00:15:01,832 --> 00:15:02,665
- Why?

830
00:15:02,665 --> 00:15:05,019
- I'm actually gonna glue a ton of squishies to mine,

831
00:15:05,019 --> 00:15:06,958
so it never gets broken on a fall.

832
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,739
- This is the perfect one, alright.

833
00:15:08,739 --> 00:15:09,572
Would you relax, Devan?

834
00:15:09,572 --> 00:15:10,405
They have feelings.

835
00:15:10,405 --> 00:15:11,238
Dude, dude, stop.

836
00:15:11,238 --> 00:15:12,071
It's so cute!

837
00:15:12,071 --> 00:15:12,937
It's like a little lamb, bro.

838
00:15:12,937 --> 00:15:13,900
Alright, here it is. Are you ready?

839
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:14,733
And go!

840
00:15:14,733 --> 00:15:16,364
Yo! Look at yours bro.

841
00:15:16,364 --> 00:15:17,292
It's so funny looking.

842
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:18,125
- Well, I know.

843
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:18,958
I don't know why,

844
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:20,479
but mine just really don't stick on it.

845
00:15:20,479 --> 00:15:21,312
- I think mine works

846
00:15:21,312 --> 00:15:22,331
because I got it out of the end of a rainbow.

847
00:15:22,331 --> 00:15:24,470
It like has magical powers. - Oh. Oh yeah.

848
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:25,303
That makes sense.

849
00:15:25,303 --> 00:15:26,741
- Oh, look how satisfying it is bro.

850
00:15:26,741 --> 00:15:27,574
- Wait, wait, wait,

851
00:15:27,574 --> 00:15:28,407
I want to try that.

852
00:15:28,407 --> 00:15:29,240
Ooooh. So soft. - It's so awesome.

853
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,351
So you get to comment down below.

854
00:15:30,351 --> 00:15:31,239
Who won this round?

855
00:15:31,239 --> 00:15:32,447
- [Together] Yo! This is...

856
00:15:32,447 --> 00:15:33,280
- Oh, no!

857
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,113
- No, don't!

858
00:15:34,113 --> 00:15:34,946
- You broke it.

859
00:15:34,946 --> 00:15:36,435
This was supposed to be a stress reliever.

860
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,480
- No, go back in there.

861
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,746
- This is mine.

862
00:15:38,746 --> 00:15:39,579
It's okay.

863
00:15:39,579 --> 00:15:40,412
Well you guys challenged us

864
00:15:40,412 --> 00:15:41,245
to make a whole bunch of crazy

865
00:15:41,245 --> 00:15:42,520
back to school stress relievers.

866
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,610
So right now, let's go!

867
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,224
Wait first, five second subscribe challenge.

868
00:15:46,224 --> 00:15:47,553
We want to see if you can subscribe

Here we go,

873
00:15:52,795 --> 00:15:56,585
- [Together] five, four, three, two, one

874
00:15:56,585 --> 00:15:57,418
Done!
