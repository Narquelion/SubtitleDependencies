1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,609
- [Both] High five!

2
00:00:01,609 --> 00:00:03,017
- Oh my gosh.

3
00:00:03,017 --> 00:00:04,740
Would you challenge us to mix together

4
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,215
every single sour candy into the largest

5
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:10,690
giant sour gummy bear of all time, but there's a twist.

6
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:11,951
So, right now let's go.

7
00:00:11,951 --> 00:00:13,840
All right, Devan, so with your eyes closed,

8
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,730
you gotta guess what this is.

9
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:16,563
Oh my gosh.

10
00:00:16,563 --> 00:00:17,396
- Oh, okay.

11
00:00:17,396 --> 00:00:18,330
- Pop it open.

12
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:19,593
- Sounds like a bag already.

13
00:00:19,593 --> 00:00:20,510
(coughing)

14
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:21,471
Bro, what?

15
00:00:21,471 --> 00:00:22,907
(clapping)

16
00:00:22,907 --> 00:00:24,870
- Holy crap, my eyes are literally watering right now.

17
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:25,703
- Is it there?

18
00:00:25,703 --> 00:00:27,020
- [Collins] Three, two, one.

19
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,820
- All right, it crunches like a chip,

20
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,293
but oh, oh, whoo, oh, it's spicy.

21
00:00:32,293 --> 00:00:33,126
- It's spicy.

22
00:00:33,126 --> 00:00:34,709
- Dude, what is this?

23
00:00:34,709 --> 00:00:35,542
(screaming)

24
00:00:35,542 --> 00:00:36,375
- What are you hitting?

25
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:37,510
- The sticks of glory.

26
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:38,343
- Ow, my lip.

27
00:00:38,343 --> 00:00:39,590
- Wait a second.

28
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:40,990
Open your mouth, Devan.

29
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:41,823
- Okay.

30
00:00:41,823 --> 00:00:42,656
- [Collins] Keep your eyes closed.

31
00:00:42,656 --> 00:00:44,010
Three, two, one, here we go.

32
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,097
- Oh, ah, what was that?

33
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:49,270
That was not the same at all.

34
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:50,103
Dude!

35
00:00:50,103 --> 00:00:50,936
- Take a bite of it.

36
00:00:50,936 --> 00:00:51,769
- Ow, my lips burn.

37
00:00:51,769 --> 00:00:53,437
Ow, is it a fish?

38
00:00:53,437 --> 00:00:54,270
- A fish?

39
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:55,103
- It's a chip.

40
00:00:55,103 --> 00:00:55,936
It's a Dorito.

41
00:00:55,936 --> 00:00:57,300
- Yes, but what kind of flavor?

42
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,050
- A spicy fish?

43
00:00:59,050 --> 00:00:59,883
Spicy tuna.

44
00:00:59,883 --> 00:01:00,812
- No! - What?

45
00:01:00,812 --> 00:01:01,645
- Devan, you can open up your eyes.

46
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:02,478
- Okay.

47
00:01:02,478 --> 00:01:03,311
- They're Wasabi Doritos.

48
00:01:03,311 --> 00:01:04,144
- Oh.

49
00:01:04,144 --> 00:01:06,124
- And I literally put a chunk of Wasabi in your mouth, bro.

50
00:01:06,124 --> 00:01:07,760
- Oh my gosh.

51
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,530
Now you can choose a sour candy

52
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,031
from the Mystery Bag of Doom.

53
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:12,995
- Okay, got it.

54
00:01:12,995 --> 00:01:14,357
- I guess we'll have to make this go away, so here we go.

55
00:01:14,357 --> 00:01:15,190
You ready?

56
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:16,610
Oh, snap.

57
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,800
So, Devan, now let's see what sour candy you got.

58
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,900
- Oh!

59
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,058
- It's like a clump of gummy worms.

60
00:01:21,058 --> 00:01:23,100
Yo, so wait, are you just gonna take a bite of that?

61
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,030
- Yeah, I mean, I think I have to at this point.

62
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,820
- Well, save some though because we need to use this

63
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,978
for the giant gummy bear that we're making, so.

64
00:01:28,978 --> 00:01:29,811
- All right.

65
00:01:29,811 --> 00:01:30,813
- So I guess, put a little bit in here.

66
00:01:30,813 --> 00:01:32,397
- Dude, you're just slamming everything around.

67
00:01:32,397 --> 00:01:33,341
- And, here we go.

68
00:01:33,341 --> 00:01:34,730
And take your bite, Devan.

69
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,022
- All right, here we go.

70
00:01:36,022 --> 00:01:39,830
Oh, oh, dude, whoa.

71
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,440
- Make sure you stick around because we will be making

72
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,560
the largest giant sour gummy bear in the entire world,

73
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,660
but right now, you're onto the next round.

74
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:48,493
He's gone.

75
00:01:48,493 --> 00:01:49,326
Where did he go?

76
00:01:49,326 --> 00:01:50,640
- All right, Collins, close your eyes.

77
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,473
- Okay.

78
00:01:51,473 --> 00:01:52,925
- This is the next item.

79
00:01:52,925 --> 00:01:53,758
- What is that?

80
00:01:53,758 --> 00:01:54,591
It sounds like it's gonna chip my tooth.

81
00:01:54,591 --> 00:01:55,560
- Oh, it might.

82
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,540
- Let's see if I can get some flavor.

83
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,482
- All right, go for it.

84
00:01:57,482 --> 00:02:00,130
- Oh, what is that?

85
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:00,963
- Let me see this.

86
00:02:00,963 --> 00:02:02,090
- What is this, bro?

87
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:02,923
- Wait, can you guess it?

88
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:05,100
I mean, it should be pretty obvious by now, right?

89
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,860
- I think it's a cucumber soda,

90
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,046
which is the weirdest thing.

91
00:02:08,046 --> 00:02:10,027
- Dude, you got it!

92
00:02:10,027 --> 00:02:11,950
- So, we got the Bag of Doom back, Devan.

93
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,398
Choose your next sour candy.

94
00:02:13,398 --> 00:02:15,279
- No, oh, it's sticky.

95
00:02:15,279 --> 00:02:18,533
It's got ants in it.

96
00:02:18,533 --> 00:02:20,350
- That reminds me of the liquid glass that we made.

97
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:21,689
- Oh, no.

98
00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:22,897
- But it has ants in it.

99
00:02:22,897 --> 00:02:23,973
(laughing)

100
00:02:23,973 --> 00:02:25,660
- Oh, really?

101
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,350
- Dude, if the ants just wanna crawl

102
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,440
away on the table, that would be so freaky.

103
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,803
- No, don't even say it.

104
00:02:29,803 --> 00:02:30,636
- But you got it now, Devan.

105
00:02:30,636 --> 00:02:31,469
Take a lick of it.

106
00:02:31,469 --> 00:02:32,620
- Dude, is this even sour?

107
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,453
- Yes.

108
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:34,390
Yeah, look at it, it's got the malic acid

109
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,223
looks like on there.

110
00:02:35,223 --> 00:02:36,485
- Oh, no, you're right, it does.

111
00:02:36,485 --> 00:02:37,937
Three, two, one.

112
00:02:37,937 --> 00:02:39,450
- You're gonna chip a tooth.

113
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,360
- Ow, that hurt so bad.

114
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,194
All right, oh, oh.

115
00:02:43,194 --> 00:02:44,027
- Are you good?

116
00:02:44,027 --> 00:02:46,200
- No, dude, what do you think, it's malic acid.

117
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,033
- Bam!

118
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:47,866
- Look inside of this.

119
00:02:47,866 --> 00:02:49,360
- Dude, you cracked like on an ant.

120
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,656
All right, guys, so Devan and I,

121
00:02:50,656 --> 00:02:51,790
we're gonna do the largest gummy bear ever.

122
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,210
We'll be doing at the end, but right now,

123
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,043
we are on to the next round.

124
00:02:54,043 --> 00:02:55,780
All right, Devan, close your eyes.

125
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:56,613
- All right.

126
00:02:56,613 --> 00:02:59,860
- And here is the next crazy, weird, food.

127
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,693
Check this out.

128
00:03:00,693 --> 00:03:01,526
- Oh no.

129
00:03:01,526 --> 00:03:02,359
- Wait a second.

130
00:03:02,359 --> 00:03:03,815
That is not what was supposed to be there.

131
00:03:03,815 --> 00:03:06,012
There's only way to fix it. It's called Yeet-Za.

132
00:03:06,012 --> 00:03:06,953
(laughing)

133
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:08,239
- Oh, dude!

134
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,370
- Yeet-Za is not for everyone.

135
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,400
- Oh, man.

136
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,386
- Let's just see if it worked.

137
00:03:12,386 --> 00:03:13,475
Boom, there we go.

138
00:03:13,475 --> 00:03:14,880
That's more like it.

139
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,937
Devan, I'm so sorry.

140
00:03:15,937 --> 00:03:18,160
- Dude, can I just win this round automatically for that.

141
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,570
- You literally, hold up, hold, up, hold up,

142
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:20,610
on your forehead.

143
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:21,443
- What?

144
00:03:21,443 --> 00:03:22,276
- Nothing, you look great.

145
00:03:22,276 --> 00:03:24,793
Here we go and remember, a sour candy is on the line.

146
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,263
- It's a pizza.

147
00:03:28,248 --> 00:03:29,850
It's like a Pringle and it's a pizza.

148
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:30,719
- How did you get that right so quickly?

149
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:32,299
- Dude, you said Yeet-Za.

150
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:34,570
- I'm gonna go with the claw, you ready?

151
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:36,363
Move this off to the side that way.

152
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:40,180
- No, no, no.

153
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,240
- I don't wanna do this.

154
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,560
These are gonna be terrible.

155
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,733
This is, hang on, sour pink lemon.

156
00:03:43,733 --> 00:03:45,970
Feel likes a pink lemon.

157
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:47,510
- It's a grapefruit, bro.

158
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:48,520
That does exist.

159
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,353
- Here we go.

160
00:03:49,353 --> 00:03:51,770
Three, two, one.

161
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:54,445
- No, you can't pull that all the time, dude.

162
00:03:54,445 --> 00:03:55,278
You gotta eat it, bro.

163
00:03:55,278 --> 00:03:56,465
- Okay, fine, okay, here we go.

164
00:03:56,465 --> 00:03:59,112
- [Both] Three, two, one.

165
00:03:59,112 --> 00:04:01,279
- Yeah, oh finally.

166
00:04:01,279 --> 00:04:03,510
How's it taste, Collin?

167
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,710
Really good?

168
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:05,770
Really good?

169
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,130
All right, well, maybe try another one.

170
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,053
Maybe it'll help.

171
00:04:08,936 --> 00:04:10,330
All right, onto the next one.

172
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,180
What, I don't, what are you saying?

173
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,570
I already said onto the next one.

174
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:14,403
- The bowl!

175
00:04:14,403 --> 00:04:15,294
- The what?

176
00:04:15,294 --> 00:04:16,127
- The bowl!

177
00:04:16,127 --> 00:04:17,480
- Oh, got it.

178
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,313
- All right, next round, let's go.

179
00:04:18,313 --> 00:04:19,768
- Collins, close your eyes.

180
00:04:19,768 --> 00:04:22,168
And this is the next item.

181
00:04:22,168 --> 00:04:23,240
Whoa!

182
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,073
All right, ready?

183
00:04:24,073 --> 00:04:24,906
- Yeah.

184
00:04:24,906 --> 00:04:26,193
- Three, two, one.

185
00:04:28,122 --> 00:04:28,955
It's not that bad.

186
00:04:28,955 --> 00:04:29,907
- It's all like hairy and fluffy.

187
00:04:29,907 --> 00:04:31,733
- Any guesses?

188
00:04:31,733 --> 00:04:33,069
- This is not good

189
00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:35,840
- I feel like this would actually be pretty good.

190
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,673
Really?

191
00:04:36,673 --> 00:04:37,506
- Oh my god.

192
00:04:37,506 --> 00:04:38,560
- Well, do you have any guesses?

193
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,907
- Oh, it's got a sweet and kinda salty...

194
00:04:40,907 --> 00:04:42,570
Oh, oh, bacon!

195
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:43,910
It's Bacon Cotton Candy!

196
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,691
- No, how did you get that?

197
00:04:45,691 --> 00:04:46,810
- Yahoo!

198
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,270
- Dude, how did you get that?

199
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,170
- Sorry, what did you say?

200
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:50,690
- How did you get that?

201
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:51,603
- Sorry, one more time.

202
00:04:51,603 --> 00:04:52,436
I can't hear you.

203
00:04:52,436 --> 00:04:54,553
- How did you get that?

204
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,470
- Sorry, what did you say?

205
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:58,635
- What, bro, how did you do that?

206
00:04:58,635 --> 00:04:59,860
(Collin mumbling)

207
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,690
- This one's really cool.

208
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:02,890
- Dude, what?

209
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:03,940
How did you do that?

210
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:04,773
- Magic!

211
00:05:04,773 --> 00:05:06,510
Damn, Devan gotta choose one of the Bag of Doom!

212
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,343
- All right, fine.

213
00:05:07,343 --> 00:05:08,176
This one!

214
00:05:08,176 --> 00:05:09,880
Whoa, it feels really light.

215
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,713
What's inside?

216
00:05:10,713 --> 00:05:11,810
I don't know.

217
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,670
Oh, wait, what?

218
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:14,503
- What?

219
00:05:14,503 --> 00:05:16,203
- Yo, they sound like they're little maracas.

220
00:05:18,198 --> 00:05:19,031
- No!

221
00:05:19,031 --> 00:05:21,510
- Yes, I've never seen a sour candy like this before ever.

222
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:22,737
- Three, two, one.

223
00:05:22,737 --> 00:05:24,670
- But first, 5 Second Subscribe Challenge.

224
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,500
We want to see if you can subscribe to this channel

225
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,180
and turn on the channel post notifications

226
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,690
in five seconds.

227
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:30,523
Are you ready?

228
00:05:30,523 --> 00:05:35,100
- [Both] Five, four, three, two, one, done.

229
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,120
- If you can do that, comment down below "Keyper Squad"

230
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,983
right now and Devan, go for it.

231
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,020
- Oh!

232
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,260
- It's like all the little beads

233
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,840
all around your teeth right now.

234
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,870
He's rocking back and forth.

235
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:46,800
- Wow.

236
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,640
- I don't know how to do this, but this looks like

237
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,690
such a weird candy, I want to try it too.

238
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:51,683
- Yeah, go for it.

239
00:05:53,206 --> 00:05:54,039
You okay?

240
00:05:55,414 --> 00:05:57,490
- And next round, let's go.

241
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,323
Here we go!

242
00:05:58,323 --> 00:06:00,217
Next item, but this is not exactly

243
00:06:00,217 --> 00:06:01,350
what I wanted it to be.

244
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:04,420
All right, hold on, I gotta get it ready, so.

245
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,680
How it comes in the wild, you know?

246
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,513
Perfect!

247
00:06:06,513 --> 00:06:07,404
All right, so let's do this.

248
00:06:07,404 --> 00:06:11,150
- Oh, oh, it's a drink. It's a drink of some sort.

249
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,069
- You have to take a little sip of it,

250
00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:13,652
see what you think.

251
00:06:15,402 --> 00:06:16,900
- Oh, man.

252
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:17,733
- Are you okay?

253
00:06:17,733 --> 00:06:18,873
- No.

254
00:06:18,873 --> 00:06:19,706
- What do you think it is?

255
00:06:19,706 --> 00:06:22,350
- It kinda tastes really sweet, like a butterscotch.

256
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,430
- Is that your final guess, butterscotch?

257
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,300
- Yes.

258
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,370
- Bro, it's corn.

259
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:27,203
- Really?

260
00:06:27,203 --> 00:06:28,320
- Yes, it's corn soda.

261
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,740
Bam, Devan! You are losing this challenge.

262
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,234
- Oh, no.

263
00:06:32,234 --> 00:06:34,810
- Those look almost like a nicer version of Smog Balls.

264
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:38,233
- Yeah, all right, well, three, two, one.

265
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,860
- Bro, they're coloring your teeth.

266
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,693
- No, really?

267
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:43,526
- Yes.

268
00:06:43,526 --> 00:06:44,359
- Aw, bit my tongue.

269
00:06:44,359 --> 00:06:45,192
- Put them in the bowl.

270
00:06:45,192 --> 00:06:47,050
- All right, Collins, you ready?

271
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:47,883
- Yep.

272
00:06:47,883 --> 00:06:48,716
- Close your eyes.

273
00:06:48,716 --> 00:06:49,549
I am very confident that you're

274
00:06:49,549 --> 00:06:51,130
not going to get this next one.

275
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:53,910
- Bro, I am a master of taste flavors.

276
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:56,870
I am a master of flavor taster, tasting.

277
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:59,210
- All right, here we go. Open wide.

278
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,276
And there.

279
00:07:00,276 --> 00:07:01,819
- Whoa, this is really good.

280
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:02,652
- Can you guess?

281
00:07:02,652 --> 00:07:03,550
- Got it! Pineapple.

282
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:04,383
- Pineapple what?

283
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:05,840
- Flavored stick.

284
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,649
- No, it's Mango Pocky.

285
00:07:07,649 --> 00:07:12,463
- Man, I do not want to have to eat another sour candy.

286
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,927
- You missed!

287
00:07:14,927 --> 00:07:15,760
- This one.

288
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,083
- Wow. Great claw, Collins.

289
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,160
No, no.

290
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,060
- Worms!

291
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:20,893
- Wow.

292
00:07:20,893 --> 00:07:21,830
- The little bottles of soda.

293
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,140
This looks super duper sour.

294
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,993
Here we go, three, two, one.

295
00:07:27,908 --> 00:07:29,260
- Are they delicious?

296
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,423
Do you want some more?

297
00:07:31,261 --> 00:07:32,111
No, are you sure?

298
00:07:33,193 --> 00:07:34,930
- So, for this one, I'm gonna need to

299
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,060
prepare it a little bit, and to do that,

300
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,030
I gotta heat things up, you know what I mean?

301
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:39,211
Oopsie.

302
00:07:39,211 --> 00:07:40,044
Devan, stay right where you are.

303
00:07:40,044 --> 00:07:41,230
- What is going on?

304
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,415
- Nothing is happening.

305
00:07:43,415 --> 00:07:45,320
All right, step one, done.

306
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,611
- This is one item, right?

307
00:07:46,611 --> 00:07:48,050
- Oh, yes, for sure.

308
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,339
Gonna pop this over here.

309
00:07:49,339 --> 00:07:50,172
- Oh, gotta sneeze.

310
00:07:50,172 --> 00:07:51,005
- And then a finishing touch.

311
00:07:51,005 --> 00:07:51,838
(Devan sneezes)

312
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:52,688
- Bless you.

313
00:07:52,688 --> 00:07:53,521
- Oh, thanks.

314
00:07:53,521 --> 00:07:54,354
- Now, it's time to roast it!

315
00:07:54,354 --> 00:07:56,258
Wow, so cool.

316
00:07:56,258 --> 00:07:59,440
- It sounds like you're making a fool of yourself.

317
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,453
Just sounds like it.

318
00:08:00,453 --> 00:08:01,286
- What?

319
00:08:01,286 --> 00:08:02,119
Stick out your tongue.

320
00:08:02,119 --> 00:08:02,952
- Okay.

321
00:08:02,952 --> 00:08:04,230
- Guess it. What do you think it is?

322
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:07,390
- Like a graham cracker or something.

323
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,913
- So we're gonna feed this to you

324
00:08:08,913 --> 00:08:11,114
the way it's intended to be eated, you ready?

325
00:08:11,114 --> 00:08:11,947
- Eated?

326
00:08:11,947 --> 00:08:12,780
- All right, Devan, open up your mouth.

327
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,750
Three, two, one, bite down.

328
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,900
One more thing, open up your mouth.

329
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,233
What is the original item that this is?

330
00:08:20,746 --> 00:08:21,579
- Goldfish?

331
00:08:21,579 --> 00:08:22,412
- How did you guess that?

332
00:08:22,412 --> 00:08:23,500
- Cause of the shape.

333
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,510
- Yes, you got it.

334
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:25,817
It's Goldfish S'mores.

335
00:08:25,817 --> 00:08:28,423
Ah, man, I can't believe you guessed it.

336
00:08:30,275 --> 00:08:32,110
Oh, yeah, these are...

337
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,140
- These are not good.

338
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:33,973
- These are rough.

339
00:08:33,973 --> 00:08:35,047
Three, two, one.

340
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,570
- I remember these.

341
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:39,023
I think I tried these.

342
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,947
We're grabbing the bucket, bro.

343
00:08:41,947 --> 00:08:43,885
Are you good, no?

344
00:08:43,885 --> 00:08:44,718
(Collins mumbles)

345
00:08:44,718 --> 00:08:47,003
All right, onto the next one.

346
00:08:47,003 --> 00:08:48,292
What? All right, cool.

347
00:08:48,292 --> 00:08:49,980
I hope you feel better.

348
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,350
All right, Collins, your eyes are closed.

349
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,183
- My eyes are closed.

350
00:08:52,183 --> 00:08:53,016
- As they can see.

351
00:08:53,016 --> 00:08:54,700
This is the next item.

352
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,030
All I can say is good luck, Collins.

353
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,810
I'm very glad I'm not doing this one.

354
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:00,150
I'm just gonna toss them in there.

355
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,250
All right, here we go, Collins.

356
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,218
Three, two, one.

357
00:09:03,218 --> 00:09:04,051
- Wait, wait, wait!

358
00:09:04,051 --> 00:09:05,000
First, let's do a 3 Second Like Challenge!

359
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,680
I want to see if you can like this video in three seconds.

360
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,530
Ready, here we go.

361
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:12,314
- [Both] Three, two, one, done.

362
00:09:12,314 --> 00:09:13,147
- All right.

363
00:09:13,147 --> 00:09:14,647
- Three, two, one.

364
00:09:15,786 --> 00:09:16,953
I missed some.

365
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,270
- It's a little bit spiky, a little bit.

366
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,507
- Any guesses so far?

367
00:09:20,507 --> 00:09:22,228
Dude, you dropped one.

368
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:26,299
- Chocolate covered, I don't know, scorpions or something?

369
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:27,132
- What?

370
00:09:27,132 --> 00:09:28,730
Chocolate covered insects, bro.

371
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,010
- No, god.

372
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:30,980
- We've got crickets.

373
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:31,813
We've got worms, bro.

374
00:09:31,813 --> 00:09:34,420
- It stuck to my tongue at one point.

375
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,269
I was trying to get it off my tongue.

376
00:09:36,269 --> 00:09:37,102
- You sound like a goose.

377
00:09:37,102 --> 00:09:37,935
- That was horrible.

378
00:09:37,935 --> 00:09:40,130
I can't believe I have to have another disgusting

379
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:41,450
thing after I just ate bugs.

380
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,480
These actually, if they weren't sour,

381
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,950
I'd probably really enjoy them

382
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,400
cause they're like Life Savers all much.

383
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,233
- All much?

384
00:09:47,233 --> 00:09:48,066
- But I.

385
00:09:48,906 --> 00:09:49,750
Let's see how these taste.

386
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,603
- All right, there we go.

387
00:09:50,603 --> 00:09:51,470
- One, two.

388
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:52,670
- Oh, yeah, has it hit yet?

389
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,503
Oh, there it is!

390
00:09:53,503 --> 00:09:56,040
- Number three is the charm.

391
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,000
- Bro, are you good?

392
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,833
Wait, did they get better?

393
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:58,930
- Yep.

394
00:09:58,930 --> 00:09:59,763
- Nice.

395
00:09:59,763 --> 00:10:01,590
- So, this is definitely the weirdest one

396
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:02,500
we've had so far.

397
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,660
I am so happy I don't have to eat this.

398
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,493
I'm serious.

399
00:10:05,493 --> 00:10:06,326
- Weirder than insects?

400
00:10:06,326 --> 00:10:07,420
- Oh my gosh.

401
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,670
- Three, two, one.

402
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,330
- He counts himself down.

403
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:12,900
- It just tastes really fizzy and very sweet.

404
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,380
- Well, take a bite of this and try to mix some flavors

405
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,480
together to give you hint of what this is.

406
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,593
What is it?

407
00:10:19,593 --> 00:10:21,390
- Well, they taste exactly the same,

408
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:24,980
so I'm going to guess that it's either bread soda

409
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,500
or toast soda.

410
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,840
- No, you didn't get it.

411
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,673
- What?

412
00:10:28,673 --> 00:10:29,570
- It's butter soda.

413
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:30,403
- Butter soda?

414
00:10:30,403 --> 00:10:31,236
- With some bread.

415
00:10:31,236 --> 00:10:33,030
Instead of butter, I was gonna put a little bit of the soda

416
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:35,010
on top of the bread and then try the bread now.

417
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:35,870
- I don't think so.

418
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:36,703
- Dude, try it.

419
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:37,536
- You try it.

420
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:38,369
- It's part of the rules.

421
00:10:38,369 --> 00:10:40,140
I can't eat the item that's not my round.

422
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,664
- Oh, so good.

423
00:10:42,664 --> 00:10:44,933
- Unfortunately, Devan, you gotta get another sour one.

424
00:10:44,933 --> 00:10:46,380
- I know. I choose you!

425
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,230
- Let's see what we got.

426
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,730
- Oh, no.

427
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:49,904
Oh, these don't look good.

428
00:10:49,904 --> 00:10:51,950
I'm gonna pour a little bit back in.

429
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:52,830
All, right, here we go.

430
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:55,023
Three, two, one.

431
00:10:58,065 --> 00:10:59,593
- You went fish lips, bro.

432
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:02,300
Do not spit on me.

433
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,133
- Oh, man.

434
00:11:03,133 --> 00:11:03,966
- I need to grab the bowl.

435
00:11:03,966 --> 00:11:04,799
- Okay.

436
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:05,632
- Don't spit on me.

437
00:11:05,632 --> 00:11:06,660
- I won't. I won't.

438
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,530
- Oh, gosh, it got on me.

439
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:10,320
Yo, all I gotta say is this sour gummy bear is going

440
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,950
to be crazy and we'll be making it coming up here shortly,

441
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,387
but right now, we are onto the next round.

442
00:11:14,387 --> 00:11:15,750
- It tastes really good now.

443
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,410
And here is the next item.

444
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,243
- Yay!

445
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,090
- Wow, it actually smells exactly like what it is.

446
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:23,580
I'm gonna do it, so you can't smell it.

447
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,640
Three, two, one.

448
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,114
Just bite, just bite, you can't smell it.

449
00:11:28,114 --> 00:11:28,947
- I think I know it!

450
00:11:28,947 --> 00:11:29,960
- What? Yes?

451
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,970
We're all waiting.

452
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:32,780
- It tastes like ketchup.

453
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,220
- Yes, dude, you got it!

454
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,700
- Dude, right, you know what would be even better?

455
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,550
- What?

456
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,383
- Oh, yeah.

457
00:11:37,383 --> 00:11:38,870
- What? Oh, dude, what?

458
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,705
Where did that come from?

459
00:11:40,705 --> 00:11:42,723
Oh, man.

460
00:11:45,417 --> 00:11:46,250
- Too much mustard.

461
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,430
- All right, I'm going for this bag here.

462
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:49,770
I think you clawed this one.

463
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:51,343
Oh! Oh, snap.

464
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:53,970
- Like sour rope.

465
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:55,310
- And you know, since you lost the challenge,

466
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:56,480
I think you're gonna have to be the one

467
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,160
who eats the giant sour gummy bear, bro.

468
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,220
- What? No!

469
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,577
Three, two, one.

470
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,173
- Oh, yo, it's like a guitar.

471
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,070
It's like the sourest spaghetti

472
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,131
you've ever had in your life.

473
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:13,280
We'll put these in here and now the moment you've

474
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,113
all been waiting for.

475
00:12:14,113 --> 00:12:17,260
Time to mix all of the sourest candies in the world together

476
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:20,590
and make a crazy giant gummy bear,

477
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:23,281
so right now, let's head to the kitchen.

478
00:12:23,281 --> 00:12:24,780
Welcome to our kitchen!

479
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,330
So guys, we're gonna be showing you how to combine

480
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:29,410
all of these sour candies into that gummy bear mold

481
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:30,710
to make a giant gummy bear.

482
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:32,310
You guys have seen us make Jell-O a whole bunch of times,

483
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:33,840
so we're gonna do this really quickly this time.

484
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,915
Super fast, check it out.

485
00:12:34,915 --> 00:12:37,498
(bouncy music)

486
00:12:39,589 --> 00:12:40,422
- Devan!

487
00:12:41,297 --> 00:12:42,840
Now is the moment you've all been waiting for.

488
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,330
It's time to take all that candy and pop it

489
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,000
into the sour Jell-O.

490
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,990
Let's get the candy and I think

491
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:49,219
we're gonna go with some vines first.

492
00:12:49,219 --> 00:12:50,203
Just kind of sprinkle them.

493
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:52,252
- Just a whole chunk of worms, bro.

494
00:12:52,252 --> 00:12:54,020
- I was going for a handful like this.

495
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,263
Dude, watch out, are you ready?

496
00:12:56,554 --> 00:12:59,720
Hold on, I gotta start mixing it in though.

497
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,310
Dude, you're missing like a ton of them.

498
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:03,373
- I forgot, bro, the clump!

499
00:13:03,373 --> 00:13:05,294
There we go. That's the amount that we want!

500
00:13:05,294 --> 00:13:06,344
Oh, I'm stepping on it!

501
00:13:06,344 --> 00:13:07,417
- All right, Devan, get the gummy bear mold.

502
00:13:07,417 --> 00:13:09,080
It's time to dump it in.

503
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,913
This is the moment of truth.

504
00:13:09,913 --> 00:13:12,150
Can we get it in without messing this up?

505
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:12,983
Okay.

506
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:15,723
- You got this, bro.

507
00:13:15,723 --> 00:13:17,241
- Oops, a bit of overflow.

508
00:13:17,241 --> 00:13:19,670
We're good, we're good, we're good.

509
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,553
One noodle left.

510
00:13:20,553 --> 00:13:22,220
Let's go, we gotta go to the fridge.

511
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,392
Teamwork makes the dream work, bro.

512
00:13:23,392 --> 00:13:25,797
Let's go, let's go. - All right, all right.

513
00:13:25,797 --> 00:13:26,630
- He's got foot power.

514
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:27,610
All right, great.

515
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:30,085
- What? What? What?

516
00:13:30,085 --> 00:13:31,033
- Foot action!

517
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,662
It's the sourest gummy bear in the world.

518
00:13:33,662 --> 00:13:35,080
[Collins] Here it is, the big reveal, you ready?

519
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,063
- [Both] Three, two, one!

520
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,918
Dude, it's like they expanded on the inside.

521
00:13:40,918 --> 00:13:41,930
- What happened?

522
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:42,820
- I don't know!

523
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:43,750
- And they juiced.

524
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,400
- Don't do that! Don't do that!

525
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,340
- Devan, you lost the challenge,

526
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,770
so you get to eat it.

527
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:50,020
- I get to? What a privilege!

528
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,310
- I feel bad though, so how bout this?

529
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:52,400
I'll take a bite of it as well.

530
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,284
And comment down below, what are some other giant gummies

531
00:13:54,284 --> 00:13:56,500
you want us to make the most sour version of?

532
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,335
So, Devan, I guess you should go for it.

533
00:13:58,335 --> 00:14:00,835
- Here we go. Three, two, one.

534
00:14:04,122 --> 00:14:05,015
- I'm gonna try, I'm gonna take a bite of it now.

535
00:14:05,015 --> 00:14:07,348
Here we go. Three, two, one.

536
00:14:09,193 --> 00:14:11,943
(both screaming)

537
00:14:14,843 --> 00:14:17,188
Oh my god, he's gonna read us another video right now.

538
00:14:17,188 --> 00:14:18,697
You have five seconds.

539
00:14:18,697 --> 00:14:21,390
- [Both] Five, four, three, two, one.

540
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,223
- Bye!
