1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,183
- This looks amazing!

2
00:00:01,183 --> 00:00:02,547
(pops) Oh my gosh!

3
00:00:02,547 --> 00:00:03,380
(laughs)

4
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:05,344
New challenge, we have to do another DIY prank

5
00:00:05,344 --> 00:00:07,306
because this one was what, like, a cake balloon?

6
00:00:07,306 --> 00:00:08,928
- Yeah! - So, right now ...

7
00:00:08,928 --> 00:00:09,761
- Hey Collins, you want a Whopper?

8
00:00:09,761 --> 00:00:11,605
- Yeah, sure, thank you. You're welcome.

9
00:00:11,605 --> 00:00:12,438
- Ah!

10
00:00:12,438 --> 00:00:13,271
- (laughs)

11
00:00:13,271 --> 00:00:14,791
- Dude!

12
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:17,279
- It's a cheese ball Whopper, bro!

13
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,682
(gags)

14
00:00:19,682 --> 00:00:20,994
- Devin, pull my finger.

15
00:00:20,994 --> 00:00:22,660
- Okay?

16
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:23,663
What?

17
00:00:23,663 --> 00:00:24,496
- Yeah, we do need that. Okay.

18
00:00:24,496 --> 00:00:27,059
Ow, geez, now that's cheesy (laughs)!

19
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:27,892
- Hah.

20
00:00:27,892 --> 00:00:29,540
Alright so here's how you make it.

21
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:30,438
Now we got our chocolate

22
00:00:30,438 --> 00:00:32,245
we're gonna melt these down to make the Whoppers

23
00:00:32,245 --> 00:00:34,677
so we gotta do it quickly cause I can feel it, it's burning.

24
00:00:34,677 --> 00:00:38,357
I can smell it, I can sense it with my senses.

25
00:00:38,357 --> 00:00:40,377
Tadah! There we go, boom, nailed it.

26
00:00:40,377 --> 00:00:41,567
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Olive oil, bro, you forgot!

27
00:00:41,567 --> 00:00:44,070
- Oh, right, right, right! Alright there we go

28
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,752
- What? Ow! Dude, how's it stuck to me?

29
00:00:45,752 --> 00:00:46,784
Dude, what is going on?

30
00:00:46,784 --> 00:00:47,617
- Eh, eh, eh.

31
00:00:47,617 --> 00:00:48,850
- And go! I gotta break it! I gotta ...

32
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:49,683
I gotta just crush it down, crush it down,

33
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:51,472
Come out, come out! Okay there we go, boom!

34
00:00:51,472 --> 00:00:53,233
Tear it on it's side. Yo, it is like legit

35
00:00:53,233 --> 00:00:54,842
burning and roasting right now

36
00:00:54,842 --> 00:00:56,112
look at this, look at this!

37
00:00:56,112 --> 00:00:59,093
This is how you make a crumbled chocolate bar.

38
00:00:59,093 --> 00:01:01,699
Doesn't that look delicious to eat and like a lot of fun?

39
00:01:01,699 --> 00:01:02,532
Oh no, dude!

40
00:01:02,532 --> 00:01:03,365
- What?

41
00:01:03,365 --> 00:01:04,691
Oh, (groans) what did I do?

42
00:01:04,691 --> 00:01:05,524
- Your moves are weak!

43
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:07,383
Yo! This is coming together nicely.

44
00:01:07,383 --> 00:01:10,511
Okay, here we go just gotta mix mix mix mix mix mix

45
00:01:10,511 --> 00:01:12,093
per usual your elbow is very close to my face.

46
00:01:12,093 --> 00:01:13,981
- Well yeah, I'm right handed bro, so uh ...

47
00:01:13,981 --> 00:01:15,582
- Devin, hand me one of the skewers.

48
00:01:15,582 --> 00:01:16,852
- There you go.

49
00:01:16,852 --> 00:01:17,968
- Here's how you retrieve the cheese ball ...

50
00:01:17,968 --> 00:01:20,367
... you gotta bam! (bag crinkles)

51
00:01:20,367 --> 00:01:21,435
Oh, I got two of them! - (laughs) Nice!

52
00:01:21,435 --> 00:01:24,107
Uh, eh, ooh, ow! (laughs)

53
00:01:24,107 --> 00:01:25,682
- Scratched your finger. Ow!

54
00:01:25,682 --> 00:01:27,599
Ow. Enough of that,

55
00:01:28,777 --> 00:01:30,243
You're gonna mix in the chocolate

56
00:01:30,243 --> 00:01:31,612
on top of your cheese puffs.

57
00:01:31,612 --> 00:01:33,986
Now it's time to empty out our lil' cheeseballs

58
00:01:33,986 --> 00:01:36,271
or, should we say, disguised Whoppers.

59
00:01:36,271 --> 00:01:39,064
Oh man! I made a steamy amount, like it's a lot there.

60
00:01:39,064 --> 00:01:41,473
That looks really ... - That looks like something

61
00:01:41,473 --> 00:01:43,069
- Looks like something to me!

62
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:45,184
- Yeah, pretty much spread them out one by one, for sure.

63
00:01:45,184 --> 00:01:46,905
- That's for sure! So right now we're gonna do that,

64
00:01:46,905 --> 00:01:47,748
pop these in the fridge and then

65
00:01:47,748 --> 00:01:48,818
do a little taste test.

66
00:01:48,818 --> 00:01:51,185
Bam! They're all done now, and that is what they look like

67
00:01:51,185 --> 00:01:53,755
so right now, Devin, it's time for you to do a taste test.

68
00:01:53,755 --> 00:01:55,584
I already had my experience.

69
00:01:55,584 --> 00:01:57,682
- Alright here we go. Three, two, one.

70
00:01:57,682 --> 00:01:59,586
- Wait first! A 5 second subscribe challenge

71
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:01,667
we want to see if you can subscribe to this channel

72
00:02:01,667 --> 00:02:03,727
and turn on the channels post notifications

73
00:02:03,727 --> 00:02:06,060
in 5 seconds. Are you ready?

74
00:02:10,025 --> 00:02:12,024
- Done. Now if you can do that comment down below

75
00:02:12,024 --> 00:02:13,497
"keyper squad" right now

76
00:02:13,497 --> 00:02:15,455
and Devin, I wanna see if your reaction is as extreme

77
00:02:15,455 --> 00:02:17,035
as mine was, so go for it.

78
00:02:17,035 --> 00:02:20,477
- Alright here we go. Three, two, one.

79
00:02:20,477 --> 00:02:22,645
(crunches)

80
00:02:22,645 --> 00:02:25,178
(coughs on repeat)

81
00:02:25,178 --> 00:02:26,135
Holy cow!

82
00:02:26,135 --> 00:02:27,020
- It's bad right?

83
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,163
- Way worse than I expected.

84
00:02:28,163 --> 00:02:31,366
How could these two delicious things taste so bad together?

85
00:02:31,366 --> 00:02:32,199
- I don't know!

86
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:34,866
Alright so right now guys we are on to the next round.

87
00:02:34,866 --> 00:02:35,702
- Hey Collins, want a piece of gum?

88
00:02:35,702 --> 00:02:36,794
- No, no, I've seen this before

89
00:02:36,794 --> 00:02:38,297
if I pull the gum it'll shock me.

90
00:02:38,297 --> 00:02:40,143
- What? No, not at all. Dude trust me.

91
00:02:40,143 --> 00:02:41,832
- (screams) Oh my gosh!

92
00:02:41,832 --> 00:02:42,964
It didn't shock me so,

93
00:02:42,964 --> 00:02:43,841
you just gave me a piece of gum?

94
00:02:43,841 --> 00:02:44,787
- That's the prank there, bro.

95
00:02:44,787 --> 00:02:45,641
- Alright, shocking gum.

96
00:02:45,641 --> 00:02:48,224
This is some weird looking gum.

97
00:02:49,187 --> 00:02:50,414
(Devin laughs)

98
00:02:50,414 --> 00:02:51,313
- What is that!?

99
00:02:51,313 --> 00:02:52,339
- It's PlayDoh, bro!

100
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:53,963
- Now the process to make this ones a little bit

101
00:02:53,963 --> 00:02:55,698
extra!

102
00:02:55,698 --> 00:02:57,675
- Oh gosh, I did not know what you were about to do.

103
00:02:57,675 --> 00:02:58,536
- 'Cause we got Extra bubble gum.

104
00:02:58,536 --> 00:03:00,542
This is not enough gum, we're gonna need

105
00:03:00,542 --> 00:03:01,394
Extra!

106
00:03:01,394 --> 00:03:02,933
There we go, we got some extra gum

107
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:04,407
get it cause it's literally Extra gum.

108
00:03:04,407 --> 00:03:06,148
This is how you do it, you juggle bro.

109
00:03:06,148 --> 00:03:06,981
- Yeah, all right.

110
00:03:06,981 --> 00:03:09,171
- Yup. All right lets do this!

111
00:03:09,171 --> 00:03:11,903
We got PlayDoh and gum so first up we gotta remove a piece.

112
00:03:11,903 --> 00:03:13,097
- Already done.

113
00:03:13,097 --> 00:03:15,129
Dude, what? (laughs) It's not ...

114
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:15,962
- I got two pieces

115
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:17,137
and now we gotta unwrap it with your mouth

116
00:03:17,137 --> 00:03:19,842
- What? That's not safe dude you should not-

117
00:03:19,842 --> 00:03:21,601
bro, what are you doing?

118
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:25,609
Dude your teeth are turning like silver, bro.

119
00:03:25,609 --> 00:03:30,385
- Yeah, for real, you might want to spit it out. Hah.

120
00:03:30,385 --> 00:03:31,218
- So first we're gonna pop another round

121
00:03:31,218 --> 00:03:35,344
and easier way to open it which is bumbumbumbabumbum.

122
00:03:35,344 --> 00:03:36,481
- Really dude?

123
00:03:36,481 --> 00:03:38,960
- So basically you gotta unwrap one of the gum pieces.

124
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,235
- Or a ton of them.

125
00:03:40,235 --> 00:03:41,068
- How did you do so many?

126
00:03:41,068 --> 00:03:42,132
Alright so basically, you just need the wrapper

127
00:03:42,132 --> 00:03:45,826
and then you can get rid of the gum so, yeet.

128
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:48,026
(sad, slow music)

129
00:03:48,026 --> 00:03:48,859
YEET!

130
00:03:50,322 --> 00:03:51,444
There is only one thing that can be done, Devin.

131
00:03:51,444 --> 00:03:52,277
- Okay.

132
00:03:52,277 --> 00:03:53,495
- A feet!

133
00:03:53,495 --> 00:03:56,247
Alright let's pop open, YEET, this here, wait Playdoh.

134
00:03:56,247 --> 00:03:57,927
Woah, can we get a replay on that?

135
00:03:57,927 --> 00:03:59,318
It popped out a very cool way.

136
00:03:59,318 --> 00:04:01,789
(banging)

137
00:04:01,789 --> 00:04:04,686
- Okay so now we're gonna take it- splet.

138
00:04:04,686 --> 00:04:05,920
- You know what, Collins, you can have some of mine.

139
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,114
- Thank you, man, I appreciate it,

140
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:08,331
so now you just have to roll it out.

141
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,956
- That doesn't look like you're rolling it, dude.

142
00:04:10,956 --> 00:04:12,213
There ya go! Nice!

143
00:04:12,213 --> 00:04:13,589
- You just gotta really get it kinda flat you can use

144
00:04:13,589 --> 00:04:15,605
actually, your PlayDoh roller - Okay.

145
00:04:15,605 --> 00:04:17,140
like this to kinda roll. - We need a roller!

146
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,205
So we just had an idea, basically if you

147
00:04:18,205 --> 00:04:19,622
take a real pice of gum,

148
00:04:19,622 --> 00:04:20,940
then you're gonna lay it on top like this

149
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,190
and then you're gonna trace the outline

150
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,066
yo this stuff cuts like PlayDoh! (whoa sound)

151
00:04:24,066 --> 00:04:26,252
- And you just gotta give it a good ol' sleecity slice.

152
00:04:26,252 --> 00:04:27,184
- Now it's time for the big reveal

153
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:28,542
of what the gum looks like. Ready?

154
00:04:28,542 --> 00:04:30,916
- Three, two, one, tadah!

155
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:32,684
- So now you're gonna place it inside

156
00:04:32,684 --> 00:04:34,035
of the wrapper very carefully

157
00:04:34,035 --> 00:04:36,201
and now you're gonna actually hide it back inside

158
00:04:36,201 --> 00:04:38,035
of your gum container, just like this

159
00:04:38,035 --> 00:04:39,747
so now you can pull out your piece of gum

160
00:04:39,747 --> 00:04:41,107
and then when you go to offer a friend

161
00:04:41,107 --> 00:04:43,397
they're gonna eat some PlayDoh, which is disgusting.

162
00:04:43,397 --> 00:04:45,462
So right now we are on to the next one.

163
00:04:45,462 --> 00:04:47,049
So Devan I wanna start this off on the right foot

164
00:04:47,049 --> 00:04:48,046
so I brought you some cookies.

165
00:04:48,046 --> 00:04:49,011
- Oh, awesome! Thanks!

166
00:04:49,011 --> 00:04:50,582
- Yeah. They're home made so tell me what you think.

167
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:52,975
(coughs)

168
00:04:52,975 --> 00:04:54,091
- Yeah well I-

169
00:04:54,091 --> 00:04:56,231
are you insulting my cookie!?

170
00:04:56,231 --> 00:04:57,499
(laughs)

171
00:04:57,499 --> 00:04:58,439
- No, they're actually made out of

172
00:04:58,439 --> 00:04:59,651
mashed potatoes and black beans.

173
00:04:59,651 --> 00:05:00,484
- Oh!

174
00:05:00,484 --> 00:05:01,317
- So for this, we're gonna need

175
00:05:01,317 --> 00:05:03,913
some water and some butter, so woohoo!

176
00:05:03,913 --> 00:05:05,897
- Oh, dude! You almost messed me up!

177
00:05:05,897 --> 00:05:06,730
(banging)

178
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,446
That' doesn't look ... (trilling sound)

179
00:05:08,446 --> 00:05:09,437
- Whoa! No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

180
00:05:09,437 --> 00:05:10,696
- Bro. What are you doing?

181
00:05:10,696 --> 00:05:13,595
Great now we just let that heat up and boil and

182
00:05:13,595 --> 00:05:14,613
- Next up we add the mashed potatoes

183
00:05:14,613 --> 00:05:16,507
so Collins I'm gonna let you do the honors.

184
00:05:16,507 --> 00:05:17,637
- Alright we got this here ... Okay.

185
00:05:17,637 --> 00:05:21,131
- Ow! (laughs) Dude you okay?

186
00:05:21,131 --> 00:05:22,418
Okay maybe you can't.

187
00:05:22,418 --> 00:05:24,235
- Oh dude, you're getting it everywhere, Devin!

188
00:05:24,235 --> 00:05:27,626
- Do you see this? This is not coming out, bro.

189
00:05:27,626 --> 00:05:28,579
Tada!

190
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:29,731
Whoa, dude, your elbow.

191
00:05:29,731 --> 00:05:30,589
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

192
00:05:30,589 --> 00:05:32,385
What? That's more than two cups.

193
00:05:32,385 --> 00:05:33,351
- It says two cups, look at it, two cups.

194
00:05:33,351 --> 00:05:34,398
- No, that's way more than two cups!

195
00:05:34,398 --> 00:05:35,873
- Oh wait yeah, that's a little bit more.

196
00:05:35,873 --> 00:05:37,934
It's like two and blahblahblah. Alright here we go.

197
00:05:37,934 --> 00:05:38,778
Alright let's see how this goes,

198
00:05:38,778 --> 00:05:40,678
now we're just gonna mix it up in there.

199
00:05:40,678 --> 00:05:42,978
Oh, you that's actually kinda satisfiying. Smoky.

200
00:05:42,978 --> 00:05:44,170
- Whoa, it smells like mac and cheese.

201
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,745
- Yo, it smells like it's burn- (screams)

202
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:46,578
- Oh. Dude you okay?

203
00:05:46,578 --> 00:05:47,411
- It looks like it's burning.

204
00:05:47,411 --> 00:05:48,839
- Alright so I'm gonna turn it off here.

205
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:49,773
- Okay, okay, okay, yo, all right.

206
00:05:49,773 --> 00:05:53,523
No, no, no! No, no! (yelling)

207
00:05:54,434 --> 00:05:56,353
- Boom! Now it's done, oh my god that's pretty hot!

208
00:05:56,353 --> 00:05:58,106
So now we got the mashed potatoes which are steaming

209
00:05:58,106 --> 00:05:59,999
and this is gonna act as the cookie dough

210
00:05:59,999 --> 00:06:02,414
so now it's actually time to make the chocolate chips

211
00:06:02,414 --> 00:06:03,713
which we're gonna use black beans for this

212
00:06:03,713 --> 00:06:06,857
so now we gotta pop it open. - All right.

213
00:06:06,857 --> 00:06:07,690
So now we're gonna pop it on here,

214
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:08,523
I've learned from my mistakes, - Be careful this time.

215
00:06:08,523 --> 00:06:11,098
All right here we go (sings). - Oh, nice.

216
00:06:11,098 --> 00:06:12,969
So now all we need is something to strain the beans with.

217
00:06:12,969 --> 00:06:14,912
Uh, oh, where did that come from?

218
00:06:14,912 --> 00:06:16,914
- (laughs) You need to work on your magical skills, brah.

219
00:06:16,914 --> 00:06:18,773
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

220
00:06:18,773 --> 00:06:21,871
Unless you want me to, BAM! Devan, Devan!

221
00:06:21,871 --> 00:06:25,782
So we got the beans and we dump it out in- (screams)

222
00:06:25,782 --> 00:06:27,897
Alright Devan, what is going on!?

223
00:06:27,897 --> 00:06:29,627
Yo, I did I clap wrong or something?

224
00:06:29,627 --> 00:06:30,889
Maybe it's like- (claps)

225
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:32,392
- Collins, help!

226
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,091
- Hold it up, hold it up, hold it up!

227
00:06:34,091 --> 00:06:34,924
(grunts)

228
00:06:34,924 --> 00:06:36,572
- Boom. Oh my gosh, okay.

229
00:06:36,572 --> 00:06:37,405
Now we're gonna add the beans which will look

230
00:06:37,405 --> 00:06:40,897
like the chocolate chips, into the mashed potatoes.

231
00:06:40,897 --> 00:06:44,455
Boom, and now, time to mix it all around.

232
00:06:44,455 --> 00:06:47,078
- Next up we add dollops of this.

233
00:06:47,078 --> 00:06:48,128
- There's an extra step to it,

234
00:06:48,128 --> 00:06:51,975
you gotta mush it together. Oh, oh, oh.

235
00:06:51,975 --> 00:06:53,025
- Dude, what is the point of that?

236
00:06:53,025 --> 00:06:55,458
- Heres a better way you can roll it in your hands first

237
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,274
and then I call this one

238
00:06:57,274 --> 00:06:59,215
Whoop-dee-doo! - Missed it.

239
00:06:59,215 --> 00:07:01,064
Whoop-dee- missed again.

240
00:07:01,064 --> 00:07:02,927
Whoop-dee-doo!

241
00:07:02,927 --> 00:07:04,428
That was a great technique!

242
00:07:04,428 --> 00:07:05,985
So right now we're gonna put all these on here

243
00:07:05,985 --> 00:07:08,098
and then pop them in the oven and bake them

244
00:07:08,098 --> 00:07:08,931
just like some cookies.

245
00:07:08,931 --> 00:07:09,764
- Whoop-dee-doo!

246
00:07:09,764 --> 00:07:10,597
- He-hey!

247
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,699
- Whoa! (slam)

248
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:13,532
- So you're going to go eat

249
00:07:13,532 --> 00:07:16,282
a nice chocolate chip cookie and-

250
00:07:18,228 --> 00:07:19,061
like it's all dry and crusty

251
00:07:19,061 --> 00:07:19,894
- What?

252
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:24,417
Alright guys! Next round, lets go.

253
00:07:24,417 --> 00:07:25,803
- Collins, have you seen my phone?

254
00:07:25,803 --> 00:07:28,530
- No, why? Have you tried calling it?

255
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:30,490
- Uh, no, let me try.

256
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:31,702
(phone chimes)

257
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:32,535
Oh wait! You found it?

258
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:33,942
- Yeah, yeah, yeah I think it's in here, I hear it.

259
00:07:33,942 --> 00:07:36,694
- No! Bro! What did you do!?

260
00:07:36,694 --> 00:07:38,847
That's my phone! That's not a joke!

261
00:07:38,847 --> 00:07:40,577
- Well I may have gone a little too far.

262
00:07:40,577 --> 00:07:41,745
- Whoa, why!?

263
00:07:41,745 --> 00:07:43,587
- Well, here, try calling it, make sure it's the right one.

264
00:07:43,587 --> 00:07:46,175
- (laughs) That's my phone! Which one is this?

265
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,632
- I'll show you guys how to do this prank right now

266
00:07:47,632 --> 00:07:49,973
because you can break a phone like that so here's how you

267
00:07:49,973 --> 00:07:51,731
do it the safe way, where you don't break the phone.

268
00:07:51,731 --> 00:07:53,397
- My heart is going so fast. - You're gonna go,

269
00:07:53,397 --> 00:07:54,848
Yo it's jello time!

270
00:07:54,848 --> 00:07:56,446
We got this here for the jello

271
00:07:56,446 --> 00:07:57,641
Peanut Butter Jello Time!

272
00:07:57,641 --> 00:07:58,474
- Yeah.

273
00:07:58,474 --> 00:07:59,905
First up we gotta add the water.

274
00:07:59,905 --> 00:08:02,465
I've got double whisks 'cause I'm a double whisk action.

275
00:08:02,465 --> 00:08:04,726
- Whoa, be careful, be careful.

276
00:08:04,726 --> 00:08:06,809
Oh my God that was close. Great job, Devan!

277
00:08:06,809 --> 00:08:09,202
Next up we're gonna add the jello in and then just kinda

278
00:08:09,202 --> 00:08:11,416
- This smell never gets old. Every time.

279
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:12,774
- Just add a little bit more jello

280
00:08:12,774 --> 00:08:14,149
Alright, all of it in, done, all right,

281
00:08:14,149 --> 00:08:14,982
mix, mix, mix, whisk, whisk, whisk,

282
00:08:14,982 --> 00:08:18,265
whisk, whisk, whisk. whisk, whisk.

283
00:08:18,265 --> 00:08:19,494
(spits) Time to get some food coloring

284
00:08:19,494 --> 00:08:22,010
so we're gonna want to go for, of course, red for this one.

285
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:23,260
- Oooh. - Whoa.

286
00:08:24,543 --> 00:08:27,467
now that we've made the jello, kinda put this to the side

287
00:08:27,467 --> 00:08:28,300
- Ugh. - Smells disgusting!

288
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,133
Now the DIY really begins

289
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,860
so Devan I want you to take this

290
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,684
I want you to cut out the phone.

291
00:08:32,684 --> 00:08:34,109
We have some dental floss and we're gonna need some tape.

292
00:08:34,109 --> 00:08:35,222
Where is the- where's the tape?

293
00:08:35,222 --> 00:08:36,572
Boom, there we go.

294
00:08:36,572 --> 00:08:37,581
- Why'd you stop?

295
00:08:37,581 --> 00:08:40,058
- Nothing. So now I get to take all the dental floss.

296
00:08:40,058 --> 00:08:40,891
We're gonna go like this and guys,

297
00:08:40,891 --> 00:08:42,245
the reason we're cutting out the phone right here

298
00:08:42,245 --> 00:08:44,510
is because of the fact that we don't want to put a real

299
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,146
phone in jello, otherwise it'll break it.

300
00:08:46,146 --> 00:08:48,034
Actually wait, hold on one second.

301
00:08:48,034 --> 00:08:48,867
All right, there we go.

302
00:08:48,867 --> 00:08:49,700
- What!?

303
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,725
- Just plucked it straight out of thin air.

304
00:08:50,725 --> 00:08:53,633
- Yo, how did he do that, dude?

305
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:54,629
- You're gonna put the tape right here on the side

306
00:08:54,629 --> 00:08:55,791
and I literally have to create

307
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,463
basically a hammock for the iPhone.

308
00:08:57,463 --> 00:08:58,868
So we're gonna take off some dental floss

309
00:08:58,868 --> 00:09:00,396
we're gonna lay it over the top like this.

310
00:09:00,396 --> 00:09:01,892
- There you go, it is all cut out

311
00:09:01,892 --> 00:09:03,705
now you put it into the phone case.

312
00:09:03,705 --> 00:09:05,042
- Okay, is it too big?

313
00:09:05,042 --> 00:09:06,052
(laughs on repeat)

314
00:09:06,052 --> 00:09:08,074
- Bro, you didn't print it out on the right side

315
00:09:08,074 --> 00:09:10,747
- Well eh- blalalalalala

316
00:09:10,747 --> 00:09:11,832
Okay, thanks!

317
00:09:11,832 --> 00:09:14,438
- And next up you put the case right on the dental floss.

318
00:09:14,438 --> 00:09:16,422
- Yup, and now you're gonna pour in the jello

319
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:18,135
and because it's suspended it will not sink

320
00:09:18,135 --> 00:09:19,154
all the way to the bottom

321
00:09:19,154 --> 00:09:20,927
it will literally be stuck in the middle.

322
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:23,578
- No! Bro, you remember what happened last time right?

323
00:09:23,578 --> 00:09:25,340
- Oh! - Oh, no, no, no, no ...

324
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,523
- It was an accident though.

325
00:09:26,523 --> 00:09:27,546
- What? Was it?

326
00:09:27,546 --> 00:09:29,260
- I'm nervous this time, this is a pranks video

327
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,916
so you cannot spill this on me, that's not a prank, Devan.

328
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:33,573
No! - All right.

329
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,475
- Dude, ow, ow, ow. - Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

330
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:36,965
- And, okay, I think with that.

331
00:09:36,965 --> 00:09:38,972
- Hold up, hold up, holll ...

332
00:09:38,972 --> 00:09:40,536
- Save some, save some, 'cause we're actually doing

333
00:09:40,536 --> 00:09:42,470
an extra prank we're gonna be doing with the left over jello

334
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:45,131
but right now, lets submerge the iPhone. Do, do!

335
00:09:45,131 --> 00:09:46,636
All right and now we're gonna stick it in the fridge

336
00:09:46,636 --> 00:09:48,538
and then the prank is ready to go.

337
00:09:48,538 --> 00:09:50,669
This looks absolutely insane

338
00:09:50,669 --> 00:09:52,484
so this next part here is the most fun

339
00:09:52,484 --> 00:09:54,516
so we gotta remove the tape first.

340
00:09:54,516 --> 00:09:56,209
- This tape is rather ... adhered. I got it!

341
00:09:56,209 --> 00:09:57,504
- Alright so here we go time to flip it over.

342
00:09:57,504 --> 00:09:58,900
- The best part!

343
00:09:58,900 --> 00:09:59,733
- Oooooh!

344
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:03,184
- That looks so cool!

345
00:10:03,184 --> 00:10:05,483
Alright next up is Devan's gonna remove the dental floss

346
00:10:05,483 --> 00:10:06,316
so pull it.

347
00:10:06,316 --> 00:10:07,891
- Oooooh.

348
00:10:07,891 --> 00:10:09,562
- This is so satisfying.

349
00:10:09,562 --> 00:10:11,845
The dental floss is literally just running through the jello

350
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:13,794
this looks amazing

351
00:10:13,794 --> 00:10:15,674
I think at the end of this video we should take

352
00:10:15,674 --> 00:10:20,089
a bite of that jello cause that looks delicious.

353
00:10:20,089 --> 00:10:21,183
- Ah! Dude, really!?

354
00:10:21,183 --> 00:10:22,505
- All right so how do you do this prank?

355
00:10:22,505 --> 00:10:23,633
- So first you blow up a balloon.

356
00:10:23,633 --> 00:10:24,466
- Okay.

357
00:10:24,466 --> 00:10:27,332
(air inflating against balloons)

358
00:10:27,332 --> 00:10:28,165
- Think that's good?

359
00:10:28,165 --> 00:10:30,298
- Next up you tie the balloon

360
00:10:30,298 --> 00:10:31,131
- Done.

361
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:31,964
- Oh, all right.

362
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:32,797
- Yay!

363
00:10:35,714 --> 00:10:36,738
- Ah, got 'em!

364
00:10:36,738 --> 00:10:37,629
- I thought it was gonna pop.

365
00:10:37,629 --> 00:10:39,237
I'm really not liking the-

366
00:10:39,237 --> 00:10:40,479
(balloon banging)

367
00:10:40,479 --> 00:10:41,581
- Next up we frost it.

368
00:10:41,581 --> 00:10:42,414
- Frost it!

369
00:10:42,414 --> 00:10:44,794
So I'm gonna take out some of this frosting. All right.

370
00:10:44,794 --> 00:10:46,465
This is the way to go.

371
00:10:46,465 --> 00:10:48,202
- Ugh, it's way messier though bro.

372
00:10:48,202 --> 00:10:50,518
- Dude, that feels super weird!

373
00:10:50,518 --> 00:10:52,890
- Oh no! (laughing)

374
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:53,723
- It got stuck to all the balloons.

375
00:10:53,723 --> 00:10:55,212
- No!

376
00:10:55,212 --> 00:10:56,289
- Okay, yo, this is actually working out

377
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:59,416
way better than I thought it would. Wow!

378
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:00,893
Now it's time for some pink stuff

379
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:03,517
it's looking like a strawberry swirl of sorts

380
00:11:03,517 --> 00:11:04,950
- Oh, that looks so good!

381
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:07,220
- Oh my gosh! I wanna eat it so bad.

382
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,753
- Like look at this bro, I just leave it

383
00:11:08,753 --> 00:11:10,341
alone for a second, and it-

384
00:11:10,341 --> 00:11:12,449
- It's because it's top heavy! - Look at that!

385
00:11:12,449 --> 00:11:13,885
- I think what I want to do with mine is I'm just gonna like

386
00:11:13,885 --> 00:11:16,158
get all the edges except for the bottom, chochochocho.

387
00:11:16,158 --> 00:11:17,887
No one would ever think twice that this is

388
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,081
actually a balloon because

389
00:11:19,081 --> 00:11:21,371
it looks like delicious cake, it smells like one

390
00:11:21,371 --> 00:11:22,692
it's gonna taste like one at first

391
00:11:22,692 --> 00:11:24,920
and then all of a sudden, pow!

392
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,616
- You know what's better-

393
00:11:26,616 --> 00:11:27,449
- Oh no!

394
00:11:28,551 --> 00:11:30,400
- I got it on my key! Not happy!

395
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,733
Oh my gosh, it's just not staying still.

396
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,653
- Oh!

397
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:36,945
We're gonna get this rolls, okay here we go, squeeze it out

398
00:11:36,945 --> 00:11:39,010
get it all over the top here

399
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:41,219
and the final step, time to add some sprinkles.

400
00:11:41,219 --> 00:11:44,173
That looks amazing! Oh my gosh!

401
00:11:44,173 --> 00:11:45,817
This looks like a legitimate cake!

402
00:11:45,817 --> 00:11:46,809
- Dude!

403
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:49,209
- That looks delicious.

404
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,042
- Whoa!

405
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,468
- Now it's very important to not pop this before

406
00:11:52,468 --> 00:11:54,266
you get to the person you're trying to prank

407
00:11:54,266 --> 00:11:55,870
because when they try to go and slice a piece

408
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:59,254
it's gonna pop all over them, as you saw

409
00:11:59,254 --> 00:12:02,631
so right now guys we are on to the next round.

410
00:12:02,631 --> 00:12:03,464
So for this one here

411
00:12:03,464 --> 00:12:05,689
all you're gonna need is the left over jello,

412
00:12:05,689 --> 00:12:07,434
some whipping creme, and some green food coloring

413
00:12:07,434 --> 00:12:09,489
'cause that'll actually change the red look of the jello

414
00:12:09,489 --> 00:12:11,449
into the kinda like, murky brown color

415
00:12:11,449 --> 00:12:12,596
and this is awesome. So what you're gonna do.

416
00:12:12,596 --> 00:12:14,272
Pull out a straw, Devan. - Ooh.

417
00:12:14,272 --> 00:12:16,388
- And then look at this. I want you to pinch the end of it,

418
00:12:16,388 --> 00:12:18,175
it's gonna push it forward like this. Okay?

419
00:12:18,175 --> 00:12:20,579
- That looks so gross!

420
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:22,279
- Ugh, that is so disgusting.

421
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:24,681
And this is how you can make edible earth worms

422
00:12:24,681 --> 00:12:25,919
and really freak people out

423
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:27,567
so I'm gonna grab a whole bunch of them at once

424
00:12:27,567 --> 00:12:31,317
here we go, that's really gross, oh my gosh!

425
00:12:33,388 --> 00:12:34,841
Literally, look at all these, bro!

426
00:12:34,841 --> 00:12:36,867
- They actually feel like worms.

427
00:12:36,867 --> 00:12:39,597
- I know and they look like it too man, ugh!

428
00:12:39,597 --> 00:12:41,021
I guess we're just gonna give these a shot.

429
00:12:41,021 --> 00:12:42,075
So here we go, Devan, pick up a worm.

430
00:12:42,075 --> 00:12:43,439
- No, we have to eat them?

431
00:12:43,439 --> 00:12:45,468
- Ready, three, two, one

432
00:12:45,468 --> 00:12:46,845
Wait, first, three second like challenge,

433
00:12:46,845 --> 00:12:48,587
we want to see if you can like this video in

434
00:12:48,587 --> 00:12:50,481
three seconds, all right here we go,

435
00:12:50,481 --> 00:12:52,481
- three, two, one, done.

436
00:12:53,691 --> 00:12:55,394
- All right so right now I gotta get a new one so here we go

437
00:12:55,394 --> 00:12:56,894
- Three, two, one.

438
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,907
- Wow - Yeah, they're delicious.

439
00:13:01,907 --> 00:13:03,437
- Yeah, now you can prank people and they will think

440
00:13:03,437 --> 00:13:05,029
that you are literally eating an earth worm

441
00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:07,564
which of course, is just jello

442
00:13:07,564 --> 00:13:08,882
now's the fun part, time to pull this phone

443
00:13:08,882 --> 00:13:10,344
out of the jello so here we go,

444
00:13:10,344 --> 00:13:12,379
three, two, one.

445
00:13:12,379 --> 00:13:13,513
- Oh, mine actually went in!

446
00:13:13,513 --> 00:13:14,346
- Mine went in a little bit too.

447
00:13:14,346 --> 00:13:15,541
Okay we're gonna try it again,

448
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:16,874
three, two, one.

449
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,685
Ow! Oh it feels so weird.

450
00:13:19,685 --> 00:13:20,935
- Oooh! Aaaaah!

451
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,638
- The phone is just like perfectly sitting in there

452
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,606
it made like a perfect impression of the phone

453
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:29,096
so now the fun part, we're just gonna take it

454
00:13:29,096 --> 00:13:30,432
and just kinda give it a tear in half

455
00:13:30,432 --> 00:13:31,570
you take that side, I'll take this side, ready.

456
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,850
- Three, two, one.

457
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:36,766
- Holy cow this feels crazy!

458
00:13:36,766 --> 00:13:39,209
If you want to see another video click right over here

459
00:13:39,209 --> 00:13:40,569

460
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:43,569
- five, four, three, two, one, done.

461
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,166
- Love you guys so much - Bye!

462
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:48,586
- Yo, these are very I- you have to be careful

463
00:13:48,586 --> 00:13:53,318

464
00:13:53,318 --> 00:13:54,940

00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:55,972

Or, I'm time
