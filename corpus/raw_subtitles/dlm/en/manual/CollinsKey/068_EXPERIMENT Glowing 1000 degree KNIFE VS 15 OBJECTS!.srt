1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,020
- What's up, it's Collins Key. Now today I am doing the

2
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,797
1000 degree glowing knife experiment.

3
00:00:04,797 --> 00:00:06,143
I've seen this thing all over YouTube

4
00:00:06,143 --> 00:00:07,503
and it looks like an absolutely blast.

5
00:00:07,503 --> 00:00:08,952
I'm not sure who started it,

6
00:00:08,952 --> 00:00:10,932
the first person I saw was Mr. Gear.

7
00:00:10,932 --> 00:00:12,260
But right now, before we get into this,

8
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:13,462
I've got a challenge for you.

9
00:00:13,462 --> 00:00:15,114
I wanna see if you can subscribe to this channel

10
00:00:15,114 --> 00:00:18,447
and turn on channel post notifications in five seconds.

11
00:00:18,447 --> 00:00:19,280
Here we go, you ready for this?

12
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,613
Five, four, three, two, one,

13
00:00:23,563 --> 00:00:24,396
done.

14
00:00:24,396 --> 00:00:25,626
If you could do that comment down below, "Keyper Squad."

15
00:00:25,626 --> 00:00:28,011
And if you wanna see me cut 4,000 matches with a glowing

16
00:00:28,011 --> 00:00:30,331
hot knife that video is live on my instagram.

17
00:00:30,331 --> 00:00:32,822
The direct link to it is down in the description below

18
00:00:32,822 --> 00:00:35,361
and if you liked that video and comment on it "Keyper Squad"

19
00:00:35,361 --> 00:00:37,177
I'll be doing through, Dming a ton of you,

20
00:00:37,177 --> 00:00:38,472
and one final thing.

21
00:00:38,472 --> 00:00:40,422
If you can translate this video, that would really mean

22
00:00:40,422 --> 00:00:41,255
a lot to me.

23
00:00:41,255 --> 00:00:42,817
I wanna make sure keypers from around the world can enjoy.

24
00:00:42,817 --> 00:00:44,957
The direct link to translate is down in the description

25
00:00:44,957 --> 00:00:45,790
below.

26
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:47,586
Also, you'll get credit in the description link.

27
00:00:47,586 --> 00:00:49,847
Your name in the description if you translate this video,

28
00:00:49,847 --> 00:00:52,531
but right now, without further ado, let's get into this,

29
00:00:52,531 --> 00:00:56,705
and this is the 1,000 degree glowing hot knife experiment.

30
00:00:56,705 --> 00:00:59,084
♫ Three, two, one, go!

31
00:00:59,084 --> 00:01:02,667
(dubstep electronic music)

32
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:07,300
- First things first, we need to heat this knife up to

33
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,364
1,000 degrees.

34
00:01:08,364 --> 00:01:10,689
Get it glowing and then we can start cutting stuff, so here

35
00:01:10,689 --> 00:01:11,522
we go.

36
00:01:15,594 --> 00:01:16,566
I'm just messing with you guys!

37
00:01:16,566 --> 00:01:17,399
Yieeeek!

38
00:01:17,399 --> 00:01:18,232
Let go.

39
00:01:18,232 --> 00:01:19,339
♫ Three, two, one, go!

40
00:01:19,339 --> 00:01:22,506
(dubstep electronica)

41
00:01:25,847 --> 00:01:27,680
♫ Go!

42
00:01:31,545 --> 00:01:32,595
♫ Three, two, one!

43
00:01:32,595 --> 00:01:34,202
- So basically I just went around my entire house,

44
00:01:34,202 --> 00:01:35,913
found a whole bunch of different random objects,

45
00:01:35,913 --> 00:01:37,537
hopefully they weren't too expensive.

46
00:01:37,537 --> 00:01:39,372
We're kickin' it off right now, this is a giant

47
00:01:39,372 --> 00:01:42,477
jawbreaker left over from a sour video Devon and I did,

48
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:46,118
so right now let's cut it open and see what happens.

49
00:01:46,118 --> 00:01:49,322
(torch hisses)

50
00:01:49,322 --> 00:01:50,384
All right guys, here we go.

51
00:01:50,384 --> 00:01:51,634
Check this out.

52
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,266
Whoa, that can't be good to breathe that in.

53
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:27,947
It's literally cutting this thing open, it's crazy.

54
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:31,299
Next up, I grab this flint stuff right here and basically

55
00:02:31,299 --> 00:02:35,674
use this to start a fire, so you go like this.

56
00:02:35,674 --> 00:02:38,257
So let's just see what happens.

57
00:02:44,858 --> 00:02:46,858
(clink)

58
00:02:48,505 --> 00:02:49,338
Awwwwwe!

59
00:02:49,338 --> 00:02:52,281
(grating sound)

60
00:02:52,281 --> 00:02:53,520
Well, we gave it a shot.

61
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,371
Next up, I grabbed a rubber band ball

62
00:02:57,371 --> 00:02:59,538
So let's see what happens.

63
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,433
(beep)

64
00:03:08,433 --> 00:03:11,183
(fire crackling)

65
00:03:19,535 --> 00:03:20,954
(alarm sounds)

66
00:03:20,954 --> 00:03:21,955
What do we do?

67
00:03:21,955 --> 00:03:23,648
Well, this did not go according to plan.

68
00:03:23,648 --> 00:03:24,481
It's just burnt.

69
00:03:24,481 --> 00:03:25,395
It's just toxic.

70
00:03:25,395 --> 00:03:27,366
Like I don't know what to,

71
00:03:27,366 --> 00:03:28,709
I've never been in this situation before.

72
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:31,293
Oh man, this is terrible.

73
00:03:31,293 --> 00:03:32,126
Ahhhhhh!

74
00:03:32,126 --> 00:03:35,355
All right, guys this is cookin' with Collins.

75
00:03:35,355 --> 00:03:36,801
This is some filet mignon.

76
00:03:36,801 --> 00:03:37,634
See it's so.

77
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:38,467
HOT!

78
00:03:38,467 --> 00:03:41,300
All right, guys, playtime is over.

79
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:43,092
Or not.

80
00:03:43,092 --> 00:03:44,358
Just look at how ruined this thing got, bro.

81
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:45,211
This used to be copper!

82
00:03:45,211 --> 00:03:48,464
(fire extinguisher hisses)

83
00:03:48,464 --> 00:03:51,018
Well, that did not go according to plan.

84
00:03:51,018 --> 00:03:51,851
At all.

85
00:03:51,851 --> 00:03:53,933
And I just ruined another one of my mom's favorite pots.

86
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:56,594
So, luckily, she's got another one though.

87
00:03:56,594 --> 00:03:57,427
Yiiikes!

88
00:03:59,171 --> 00:04:01,508
Next up, I've got AXE, but instead of cutting this with a

89
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:03,207
knife, I'm gonna be cutting this with.

90
00:04:03,207 --> 00:04:04,457
You guessed it.

91
00:04:05,457 --> 00:04:06,835
An actual axe!

92
00:04:06,835 --> 00:04:07,922
All right guys, let's look at the cast iron.

93
00:04:07,922 --> 00:04:08,755
Oh my god!

94
00:04:09,655 --> 00:04:11,490
The axe is on fire guys!

95
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,032
Dude, the axe is actually on fire!

96
00:04:13,032 --> 00:04:16,199
(dubstep electronica)

97
00:04:32,056 --> 00:04:33,224
Okay, that was pretty awesome.

98
00:04:33,224 --> 00:04:34,526
Like I said, I've just been grabbing a whole bunch of random

99
00:04:34,526 --> 00:04:35,876
stuff from around the house.

100
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:37,549
I've found that mom has some like bath bombs, and like,

101
00:04:37,549 --> 00:04:39,670
I don't even know what this is, so I'm gonna cut these

102
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:41,531
open, see what happens, hopefully it's not a bomb,

103
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,581
it doesn't explode, and it smells.

104
00:04:44,581 --> 00:04:45,443
It smells nice.

105
00:04:45,443 --> 00:04:47,469
(torch hisses)

106
00:04:47,469 --> 00:04:50,449
All right guys, here we go, check this out.

107
00:04:50,449 --> 00:04:51,662
Ohhhhh! I did it!

108
00:04:51,662 --> 00:04:52,495
Yeah!

109
00:04:52,495 --> 00:04:53,662
It wasn't like satisfying.

110
00:04:53,662 --> 00:04:55,873
It wasn't cool, but I made it through.

111
00:04:55,873 --> 00:04:57,475
I found this funky lookin' one, so let's give this

112
00:04:57,475 --> 00:04:58,308
one a shot.

113
00:04:58,308 --> 00:04:59,933
Have I mentioned how much I love these blow torches?

114
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:01,002
All right guys, one chance.

115
00:05:01,002 --> 00:05:01,835
One take.

116
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:03,330
Let's get this all the way through.

117
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:05,830
(electronica)

118
00:05:17,866 --> 00:05:18,699
I did it!

119
00:05:18,699 --> 00:05:19,774
That was super satisfying.

120
00:05:19,774 --> 00:05:21,599
I don't know if it was satisfying for you.

121
00:05:21,599 --> 00:05:23,289
But it was satisfying for me.

122
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:24,122
I'm gonna try this again.

123
00:05:24,122 --> 00:05:25,039
Here we go.

124
00:05:32,986 --> 00:05:34,721
Next up, I found our entire stash of crayons

125
00:05:34,721 --> 00:05:36,556
(children yell in excitement)

126
00:05:36,556 --> 00:05:38,078
So, I'm really excited to see what this one looks like.

127
00:05:38,078 --> 00:05:39,933
Hopefully, it like goes everywhere and turns into, like, a

128
00:05:39,933 --> 00:05:41,942
really cool artwork piece, but I guess we'll just find out.

129
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:44,525
(torch hisses)

130
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,257
Ohhhh, this is crazy.

131
00:05:55,257 --> 00:05:56,090
Whoa.

132
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,302
This stuff is all so flammable, man.

133
00:06:00,302 --> 00:06:01,820
All right, guys, imma separate the stacks now, 'cause

134
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,016
like it's too hard to cut through whole stacks at the

135
00:06:04,016 --> 00:06:04,849
same time.

136
00:06:04,849 --> 00:06:06,976
But now we're just gonna see if I can cut through one stack

137
00:06:06,976 --> 00:06:07,940
all the way through.

138
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,232
There's a ton of smoke coming out.

139
00:06:09,232 --> 00:06:10,774
This thing is actually on fire right now.

140
00:06:10,774 --> 00:06:12,274
So let's just go.

141
00:06:12,274 --> 00:06:13,107
Here we go.

142
00:06:13,107 --> 00:06:13,940
Oohhhhh!

143
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,273
(whistling)

144
00:06:26,893 --> 00:06:28,845
Well, I know we made it through one box now, now let's see

145
00:06:28,845 --> 00:06:30,074
if we can make it through all the boxes,

146
00:06:30,074 --> 00:06:31,461
I think we made it through the second box.

147
00:06:31,461 --> 00:06:34,576
It's literally shooting wax everywhere right now.

148
00:06:34,576 --> 00:06:35,409
This is crazy.

149
00:06:35,409 --> 00:06:36,242
All right, here we go.

150
00:06:36,242 --> 00:06:37,075
I'm gonna do this one final.

151
00:06:37,075 --> 00:06:37,908
Oh my gosh! Actually.

152
00:06:37,908 --> 00:06:39,230
(blows repeatedly)

153
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,533
Like I said, I'm gonna do this one last time.

154
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:42,147
But this time I'm gonna touch it to the front of all these

155
00:06:42,147 --> 00:06:43,874
different crayons right now, and just see

156
00:06:43,874 --> 00:06:45,352
how melted they get.

157
00:06:45,352 --> 00:06:47,402
So let's just do this.

158
00:06:47,402 --> 00:06:50,985
(electronic intstrumental)

159
00:06:56,069 --> 00:06:59,313
You literally can just like slice right through the crayons.

160
00:06:59,313 --> 00:07:00,480
This is crazy.

161
00:07:04,545 --> 00:07:05,465
Oh this thing is just a mess.

162
00:07:05,465 --> 00:07:07,263
I don't think you guys can see this.

163
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,175
But just look at this.

164
00:07:08,175 --> 00:07:11,497
They're actually getting pretty melted in here.

165
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:13,247
I wanna see this box.

166
00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:17,605
What do I like more than burning things on fire than

167
00:07:17,605 --> 00:07:19,016
even the hot knife challenge, 'cause that's like pretty

168
00:07:19,016 --> 00:07:19,849
much all this is.

169
00:07:19,849 --> 00:07:20,682
Just a lot of stuff, on fire,

170
00:07:20,682 --> 00:07:21,737
the entire time.

171
00:07:21,737 --> 00:07:23,320
And the boxes, man.

172
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,546
This is on fire.

173
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:27,992
All right, guys, so next up we've got right here.

174
00:07:27,992 --> 00:07:29,148
The pig.

175
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:31,296
Now this is my dad's favorite item.

176
00:07:31,296 --> 00:07:32,129
And listen to this.

177
00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:36,046
(pig hums pop goes the weasel)

178
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,192
So we're gonna cut it open!

179
00:07:41,192 --> 00:07:42,072
Sorry, dad.

180
00:07:42,072 --> 00:07:43,856
(pig hums pop goes the weasel)

181
00:07:43,856 --> 00:07:48,023
(distorted humming continues, fades)

182
00:07:50,245 --> 00:07:52,266
Let's see if it still works.

183
00:07:52,266 --> 00:07:53,432
Noooooo!

184
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:54,376
The pig is gone!

185
00:07:54,376 --> 00:07:55,209
Ohhh, that's hot.

186
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:56,501
And there's smoke in my face!

187
00:07:56,501 --> 00:08:00,168
I think that's all we're gonna get outta it.

188
00:08:02,778 --> 00:08:03,831
And now it's time.

189
00:08:03,831 --> 00:08:04,991
To cut the cheese.

190
00:08:04,991 --> 00:08:09,158
(classical music plays, pauses abruptly)

191
00:08:11,031 --> 00:08:12,057
I'm sorry.

192
00:08:12,057 --> 00:08:15,557
(classical music resumes)

193
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,271
Ohhhhh, this is horrible.

194
00:08:26,271 --> 00:08:30,412
Imagine, like, a grilled cheese, but just gone wrong.

195
00:08:30,412 --> 00:08:32,029
It just sinks into the cheese.

196
00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:33,403
Trust me, it's awful.

197
00:08:33,403 --> 00:08:34,236
(horn honks)

198
00:08:34,236 --> 00:08:35,069
All right guys, I've learned my lesson.

199
00:08:35,069 --> 00:08:36,582
I'm still gonna use my mom's pan, but this time imma put

200
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:38,577
aluminium foil around it, that way, hopefully it doesn't get

201
00:08:38,577 --> 00:08:39,410
as ruined.

202
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:40,353
Now we've got this bouncy ball right here.

203
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,798
Which has, like, a fish inside of it.

204
00:08:41,798 --> 00:08:43,947
So, I don't really know what this thing does, or why it's

205
00:08:43,947 --> 00:08:45,364
in our house, but

206
00:08:46,964 --> 00:08:48,698
(laughs)

207
00:08:48,698 --> 00:08:50,448
we're gonna do it so,

208
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:52,712
That was cool

209
00:08:52,712 --> 00:08:54,295
(torch hisses)

210
00:08:54,295 --> 00:08:55,530
(knife sizzles)

211
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:56,697
AWWWWWWWWWWW!!

212
00:08:59,351 --> 00:09:00,184
AWWEEE!

213
00:09:00,184 --> 00:09:01,238
I hope this stuff isn't toxic!

214
00:09:01,238 --> 00:09:04,571
Because, uh, it just shot all in my eye.

215
00:09:05,654 --> 00:09:06,617
Ow.

216
00:09:06,617 --> 00:09:07,450
(beep)

217
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,941
Well, I learned from my mistakes.

218
00:09:09,941 --> 00:09:11,428
No longer will I get water in my eye.

219
00:09:11,428 --> 00:09:14,114
So basically, I froze a coca cola bottle, a glass bottle.

220
00:09:14,114 --> 00:09:15,995
I'm gonna be hitting it with a hot knife.

221
00:09:15,995 --> 00:09:18,211
I'm guessing it's going to explode, so I'm takin every

222
00:09:18,211 --> 00:09:19,044
precaution.

223
00:09:19,044 --> 00:09:20,472
I've got like a hazmat suit on.

224
00:09:20,472 --> 00:09:24,113
I've got my awesome welder's mask on too

225
00:09:24,113 --> 00:09:26,235
and we're just gonna see what happens.

226
00:09:26,235 --> 00:09:28,818
(torch hisses)

227
00:09:33,789 --> 00:09:34,839
(bottle clinks)

228
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,114
(beep)

229
00:09:37,114 --> 00:09:39,589
(beep)

230
00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:41,214
(bottle clinks)

231
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:42,047
(laughs)

232
00:09:42,047 --> 00:09:43,028
Yeah, I don't know what to do.

233
00:09:43,028 --> 00:09:46,736
Well, there goes my axe, and I guess there goes

234
00:09:46,736 --> 00:09:50,499
whatever was supposed to happen there.

235
00:09:50,499 --> 00:09:51,332
Yay.

236
00:09:52,727 --> 00:09:53,560
This is crazy.

237
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,467
The axe is so hot when the head of it fell off, it

238
00:09:55,467 --> 00:09:57,488
literally just melted through the table.

239
00:09:57,488 --> 00:09:58,719
I didn't know what was going on, I just heard a clunk.

240
00:09:58,719 --> 00:09:59,939
Check this out.

241
00:09:59,939 --> 00:10:02,088
Look! Look down there, look down there!

242
00:10:02,088 --> 00:10:04,099
It literally melted through the table.

243
00:10:04,099 --> 00:10:06,016
Fam, this video is LIT.

244
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,175
With this wood, I went through the bathroom, grabbed a whole

245
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:10,963
bunch of bars of soap, and I want you guys to guess which

246
00:10:10,963 --> 00:10:13,390
soap bar belongs to which family member, so we've got

247
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:17,557
the Dial one, we have Olay, and then we have Irish Spring.

248
00:10:18,778 --> 00:10:22,111
I'll give you a little hint on that one.

249
00:10:24,043 --> 00:10:24,876
(laughs)

250
00:10:24,876 --> 00:10:26,793
So let's cut them open.

251
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:42,069
Can we do it, Irish Spring?

252
00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:43,153
Make a way, laddie.

253
00:10:43,153 --> 00:10:44,277
(laughs) We did it!

254
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:46,251
A lot of you guys know my brother, Devon, has really awesome

255
00:10:46,251 --> 00:10:48,370
hair and the secret to it, is this stuff right here.

256
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:49,572
This is his hair gel.

257
00:10:49,572 --> 00:10:52,184
It's got a "D" on it, stands for Devon, so hopefully he

258
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:53,637
doesn't need this, so we're gonna cut this open, see

259
00:10:53,637 --> 00:10:55,554
what happens, and yeah.

260
00:10:57,597 --> 00:11:00,264
(knife sizzles)

261
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:06,063
(laughs)

262
00:11:06,063 --> 00:11:06,919
Is it ruined?

263
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:08,012
Devon, whatever you're using, this stuff

264
00:11:08,012 --> 00:11:09,202
smells delicious, bro.

265
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:11,120
If I look, it burned my hand through these professional

266
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,002
welding gloves.

267
00:11:12,002 --> 00:11:14,407
So if you guys wanna know how hot this knife is, it's so

268
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:15,240
hot.

269
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,167
This is a professional welders glove, and it just burned my

270
00:11:17,167 --> 00:11:19,497
hand through this, so I'm gonna give this one more chop.

271
00:11:19,497 --> 00:11:20,675
(knife chops)

272
00:11:20,675 --> 00:11:23,342
(knife sizzles)

273
00:11:27,761 --> 00:11:29,560
Yo, the gel is literally shooting out every.

274
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,393
Oh my gosh!

275
00:11:30,393 --> 00:11:31,226
It's getting all over me, man.

276
00:11:31,226 --> 00:11:32,275
This is crazy.

277
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:33,957
Can I get it all the way through?

278
00:11:33,957 --> 00:11:35,467
I don't think so, fam.

279
00:11:35,467 --> 00:11:36,918
Look at this, fam, we are so close.

280
00:11:36,918 --> 00:11:40,714
Sometimes you try your best, but you don't succeed.

281
00:11:40,714 --> 00:11:42,150
All right, we're gonna go over this one final time.

282
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:42,983
Here we go.

283
00:11:42,983 --> 00:11:44,392
(torch hisses)

284
00:11:44,392 --> 00:11:46,542
Here we go, this should do it.

285
00:11:46,542 --> 00:11:49,285
Oooohhhh, it shot in my face.

286
00:11:49,285 --> 00:11:51,817
Awwww, that actually really hurt.

287
00:11:51,817 --> 00:11:54,918
All right, that literally flew up and flew right underneath

288
00:11:54,918 --> 00:11:57,087
my eye and it really hurts.

289
00:11:57,087 --> 00:11:59,030
So this is why you always wanna make sure you have parental

290
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:01,609
supervision when doing this, make sure you're in a safe

291
00:12:01,609 --> 00:12:03,962
environment, and do not, apparently, do your brother's

292
00:12:03,962 --> 00:12:05,843
hair gel, because, it will come back to bite you.

293
00:12:05,843 --> 00:12:08,123
And also wear safety goggles, because I don't think your

294
00:12:08,123 --> 00:12:09,945
parent will be able to stop a driplet, of, is that a word?

295
00:12:09,945 --> 00:12:10,778
(beep)

296
00:12:10,778 --> 00:12:12,466
And also wear safety goggles, because I don't think your

297
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:14,478
parent will be able to stop a drop of this stuff flying

298
00:12:14,478 --> 00:12:16,425
into your face, unless they do a protection dive.

299
00:12:16,425 --> 00:12:18,376
That's not gonna happen, so let's go to the next one.

300
00:12:18,376 --> 00:12:19,925
This next one's gonna be an explosion.

301
00:12:19,925 --> 00:12:21,824
It's a hot knife, vs. a light bulb.

302
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:22,822
But not just one.

303
00:12:22,822 --> 00:12:23,872
A whole bunch of 'em.

304
00:12:23,872 --> 00:12:25,191
But first, the one you all have been waiting for.

305
00:12:25,191 --> 00:12:26,607
Orbeez!

306
00:12:26,607 --> 00:12:28,843
I'm gonna start off with one of the smaller orbeez first

307
00:12:28,843 --> 00:12:30,168
and move to the bigger ones.

308
00:12:30,168 --> 00:12:31,920
Let's see, I've heard it's really hard to chop these.

309
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,428
Let's give it a shot.

310
00:12:34,428 --> 00:12:37,178
(orbeez squeeks)

311
00:12:41,081 --> 00:12:42,113
All right, that was pretty crazy, but right now we're about

312
00:12:42,113 --> 00:12:44,375
to take this to another level and do it with one of these

313
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:46,510
large - oh, it's really hard to grab in these gloves.

314
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:48,472
All right, one of these big orbeez right here, so let's,

315
00:12:48,472 --> 00:12:49,805
uh, let's do it.

316
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:54,753
(anti-climactic dubstep plays)

317
00:13:07,103 --> 00:13:09,850
I never thought I would say that I feel bad for an orbee,

318
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,293
but right - did you hear that sound?

319
00:13:11,293 --> 00:13:12,622
I feel bad for this orbee.

320
00:13:12,622 --> 00:13:15,539
(orbee flatulates)

321
00:13:17,139 --> 00:13:17,972
(laughs)

322
00:13:17,972 --> 00:13:18,951
Yeah, that orbee just ripped it.

323
00:13:18,951 --> 00:13:21,915
(orbeez shrilly shriek)

324
00:13:21,915 --> 00:13:23,368
And last but not least, we've got the light bulb right here,

325
00:13:23,368 --> 00:13:25,693
but this one here is a little bit too small, so, yehy.

326
00:13:25,693 --> 00:13:26,526
(glass shatters)

327
00:13:26,526 --> 00:13:27,359
We're using.

328
00:13:27,359 --> 00:13:29,030
These ones.

329
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:32,780
(dramatic suspenseful music)

330
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,411
Are you kidding me?

331
00:13:39,411 --> 00:13:40,682
(torch hisses)

332
00:13:40,682 --> 00:13:41,580
All right, here we go.

333
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,745
The moment you've all been waiting for.

334
00:13:42,745 --> 00:13:43,578
The big one.

335
00:13:43,578 --> 00:13:44,411
Check this out.

336
00:13:44,411 --> 00:13:45,944
Three.

337
00:13:45,944 --> 00:13:47,411
Two.

338
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:48,480
One.

339
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,312
- Hey have you seen my hair gel anywhere?

340
00:13:52,312 --> 00:13:53,295
- Your hair gel?

341
00:13:53,295 --> 00:13:54,277
- Can you just help me look for it?

342
00:13:54,277 --> 00:13:56,694
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. For sure.

343
00:14:00,558 --> 00:14:03,141
(instrumental)
