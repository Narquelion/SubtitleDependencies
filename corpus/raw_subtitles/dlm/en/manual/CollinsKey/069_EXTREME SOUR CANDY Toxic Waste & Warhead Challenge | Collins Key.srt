1
00:00:00,186 --> 00:00:02,351
- Three, two, one, go!

2
00:00:02,351 --> 00:00:06,167
(screaming, laughing, crying)

3
00:00:06,167 --> 00:00:08,544
(yelling)

4
00:00:08,544 --> 00:00:09,377
- What's up?

5
00:00:09,377 --> 00:00:11,304
It's Collins Key and welcome to the Thursday blog.

6
00:00:11,304 --> 00:00:13,893
And for today's video, I have two chairs next to me.

7
00:00:13,893 --> 00:00:15,520
This is unprecedented for a video,

8
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,049
so first of all I want to please welcome,

9
00:00:17,049 --> 00:00:19,023
all the way from his bedroom right now,

10
00:00:19,023 --> 00:00:20,547
my little brother, Devan Key.

11
00:00:20,547 --> 00:00:21,380
(snaps)

12
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:22,213
- [Both] Hey!

13
00:00:22,213 --> 00:00:23,046
What's up, bro?

14
00:00:23,046 --> 00:00:24,432
- Teleportation on fleek!

15
00:00:24,432 --> 00:00:26,082
- Thank you bro, good to see you.

16
00:00:26,082 --> 00:00:27,340
- Yeah, so welcome back - So now we actually have

17
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,624
one more guest that I am actually going to teleport.

18
00:00:29,624 --> 00:00:30,457
- Oooh!

19
00:00:30,457 --> 00:00:32,194
- From Michigan, California, please welcome

20
00:00:32,194 --> 00:00:33,940
- Michigan, California?

21
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:35,437
- My cousin, Cavanaugh.

22
00:00:35,437 --> 00:00:37,204
- [All] Oooooh!

23
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:38,037
- There we go.

24
00:00:38,037 --> 00:00:38,870
- Devan needs to work on his

25
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:39,708
teleportation skills, - Yes

26
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:40,585
- Just a little bit.

27
00:00:40,585 --> 00:00:42,264
So, for today's video, we are going to be tasting

28
00:00:42,264 --> 00:00:45,710
a whole bunch of super, super sour candy.

29
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:46,948
But we thought, you know what?

30
00:00:46,948 --> 00:00:48,134
If we just do a whole bunch of sour candy,

31
00:00:48,134 --> 00:00:49,413
the entire time, that's no fun

32
00:00:49,413 --> 00:00:51,146
because it's going to be a whole bunch of

33
00:00:51,146 --> 00:00:52,789
What we thought we'd do, we would break it up, do

34
00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:55,343
super sweet candy in between the sour candy

35
00:00:55,343 --> 00:00:56,176
so that way our taste buds

36
00:00:56,176 --> 00:00:57,678
are in complete confusion the entire time.

37
00:00:57,678 --> 00:00:59,426
Now, since this candy is so sour,

38
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:00,885
it's going to be extremely painful,

39
00:01:00,885 --> 00:01:02,437
so please give this video a big thumbs up

40
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:04,579
for some encouragement because

41
00:01:04,579 --> 00:01:05,601
I don't want to be in pain!

42
00:01:05,601 --> 00:01:06,434
So yeah, if you guys give

43
00:01:06,434 --> 00:01:07,545
- Wait, wait, wait, hold on, hold on.

44
00:01:07,545 --> 00:01:08,724
We're gonna be in pain?

45
00:01:08,724 --> 00:01:09,557
- Yeah.

46
00:01:09,557 --> 00:01:10,686
- I think so. - You're telling me

47
00:01:10,686 --> 00:01:11,707
I came all the way from Michigan.

48
00:01:11,707 --> 00:01:12,804
- I can't make you go back now.

49
00:01:12,804 --> 00:01:14,355
You saw how bad I did on the way here.

50
00:01:14,355 --> 00:01:15,631
- Yeah, you're right, you've just got to do it, bro.

51
00:01:15,631 --> 00:01:16,777
- You can give me a little heads up next time.

52
00:01:16,777 --> 00:01:17,707
- Alright, cool, will do.

53
00:01:17,707 --> 00:01:19,689
If this video gets enough thumbs up, you know what?

54
00:01:19,689 --> 00:01:20,522
We might make him teleport

55
00:01:20,522 --> 00:01:22,608
all the way back from Michigan and do another video.

56
00:01:22,608 --> 00:01:24,180
So yeah, make sure you give this video a big thumbs up.

57
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,985
Also, I'm doing a huge giveaway on my channel right now.

58
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:27,487

Of course, he watches.

65
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,650
- But right now, let's go right into the video.

66
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:41,589
- Oh gosh. - So these are

67
00:01:41,589 --> 00:01:43,556
super lemon. That's all it says.

68
00:01:43,556 --> 00:01:45,514
- This isn't even in English.

69
00:01:45,514 --> 00:01:46,495
That can't be good.

70
00:01:46,495 --> 00:01:47,551
It's not even yellow.

71
00:01:47,551 --> 00:01:48,511
- This is gonna kill us.

72
00:01:48,511 --> 00:01:50,020
- You guys since this is our first one,

73
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:50,853
- Oh no.

74
00:01:50,853 --> 00:01:52,088
- What do you say we do two at once?

75
00:01:52,088 --> 00:01:52,921
- What?

76
00:01:52,921 --> 00:01:53,754
- Let's do it.

77
00:01:53,754 --> 00:01:54,587
- Let's do it.

78
00:01:54,587 --> 00:01:56,189
- I'm two times the amount of nervous I was before.

79
00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:57,414
- Alright, here we go,

80
00:01:57,414 --> 00:01:58,247
three,

81
00:01:58,247 --> 00:01:59,214
two,

82
00:01:59,214 --> 00:02:00,047
one.

83
00:02:00,047 --> 00:02:03,216
(soft electronic dance music)

84
00:02:03,216 --> 00:02:05,779
(muffled groan)

85
00:02:05,779 --> 00:02:06,633
- Oh, no.

86
00:02:06,633 --> 00:02:09,630
(muffled wimpers)

87
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,630
- Oh my god!

88
00:02:12,297 --> 00:02:13,297
- Oh my god!

89
00:02:14,138 --> 00:02:14,971
- Wooo!

90
00:02:16,476 --> 00:02:18,059
- That's worse than I thought.

91
00:02:18,059 --> 00:02:18,892
- Wooo!

92
00:02:21,212 --> 00:02:23,807
(inarticulate cries)

93
00:02:23,807 --> 00:02:24,640
- Wow.

94
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,685
- It's like in my nose.

95
00:02:25,685 --> 00:02:27,219
(laughing)

96
00:02:27,219 --> 00:02:28,966
- I can taste it with my nose.

97
00:02:28,966 --> 00:02:29,808
- Oh my god.

98
00:02:29,808 --> 00:02:31,913
(muffled cries)

99
00:02:31,913 --> 00:02:33,123
Oh my god.

100
00:02:33,123 --> 00:02:34,499
They're all like nice and sweet now, but

101
00:02:34,499 --> 00:02:35,956
- Hey, it's nice and sweet.

102
00:02:35,956 --> 00:02:37,778
- Alright, that was the first one.

103
00:02:37,778 --> 00:02:38,961
Now we need some sweet stuff now.

104
00:02:38,961 --> 00:02:40,538
That was intense. - My eyes are watering.

105
00:02:40,538 --> 00:02:41,648
- I know yeah, mine were literally, like there's

106
00:02:41,648 --> 00:02:42,920
a little bit of tears coming out,

107
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,019
but we're gonna try the next one.

108
00:02:44,019 --> 00:02:45,830
Right now, let's eat a sweet candy.

109
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:46,795
I need some sweetness.

110
00:02:46,795 --> 00:02:48,596
For the sweet one we have these Minion candies.

111
00:02:48,596 --> 00:02:49,829
So I don't even know what these are.

112
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:50,662
- Wait,

113
00:02:50,662 --> 00:02:51,495
- It says try me.

114
00:02:51,495 --> 00:02:52,328
It says push on.

115
00:02:52,328 --> 00:02:53,161
(laughing)

116
00:02:53,161 --> 00:02:53,994
Hey!

117
00:02:53,994 --> 00:02:54,827
(gasping)

118
00:02:54,827 --> 00:02:55,756
- This is awesome!

119
00:02:55,756 --> 00:02:56,589
- Oh I know.

120
00:02:56,589 --> 00:02:57,816
- 'Cause you get to spin it in your mouth

121
00:02:57,816 --> 00:02:59,004
- It does the licking for you.

122
00:02:59,004 --> 00:03:00,827
- Oh that's so cool!

123
00:03:00,827 --> 00:03:04,443
(lollipops spinning)

124
00:03:04,443 --> 00:03:05,676
- Mmm!

125
00:03:05,676 --> 00:03:06,913
- It's oddly satisfying.

126
00:03:06,913 --> 00:03:08,037
(laughing)

127
00:03:08,037 --> 00:03:08,888
- Minions for the win.

128
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:12,636
- This one here is called Toxic Waste Zaps, sour bubble gum.

129
00:03:12,636 --> 00:03:16,051
So, whoever can blow a bubble first, wins

130
00:03:16,051 --> 00:03:18,116
and the two losers have to do one more

131
00:03:18,116 --> 00:03:20,669
of these really crazy lemon ones we just did.

132
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:21,532
- Ooooh.

133
00:03:21,532 --> 00:03:22,695
We have to wait for Cavanaugh, though.

134
00:03:22,695 --> 00:03:23,647
He's a little challenged.

135
00:03:23,647 --> 00:03:25,198
(laughing)

136
00:03:25,198 --> 00:03:27,290
- Three, two, one.

137
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,260
(high-pitched squeal)

138
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,108
(muffled cry)

139
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:29,941
- Dude, wow!

140
00:03:29,941 --> 00:03:30,942
Oh that's sour!

141
00:03:30,942 --> 00:03:32,442
- It's not sour yet.

142
00:03:32,442 --> 00:03:34,516
- Just wait for it. - Oh, man.

143
00:03:34,516 --> 00:03:37,183
(loud grunting)

144
00:03:38,043 --> 00:03:38,876
- Aw.

145
00:03:38,876 --> 00:03:41,543
- You're getting super sour now.

146
00:03:44,292 --> 00:03:45,125
Oooh!

147
00:03:46,077 --> 00:03:46,910
He got it!

148
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:49,132
Devan won. - Yay

149
00:03:49,132 --> 00:03:51,117
- Alright, so we lost so we have to eat one of these

150
00:03:51,117 --> 00:03:52,421
so we'll open it up.

151
00:03:52,421 --> 00:03:54,460
I'm just gonna do mine quick right now.

152
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,293
I'm just gonna pop it in.

153
00:03:55,293 --> 00:03:57,735
- Oh yeah, uh-huh, feel the pain,

154
00:03:57,735 --> 00:03:58,779
feel the pain. - Augh!

155
00:03:58,779 --> 00:04:00,879
- I feel like where's the?

156
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:01,796
- It hurts.

157
00:04:03,705 --> 00:04:05,351
- Yes! - It was worse

158
00:04:05,351 --> 00:04:06,184
- Tickle challenge!

159
00:04:06,184 --> 00:04:07,305
- [Brothers] Oooh!

160
00:04:07,305 --> 00:04:09,135
- I'm so sorry, bro.

161
00:04:09,135 --> 00:04:10,145
You okay?

162
00:04:10,145 --> 00:04:11,829
- My arm almost just snapped.

163
00:04:11,829 --> 00:04:13,682
(all laughing)

164
00:04:13,682 --> 00:04:16,171
I'll never touch you again with sour things in your mouth.

165
00:04:16,171 --> 00:04:17,561
- Alright, let's do the next sweet one.

166
00:04:17,561 --> 00:04:18,426
I need something sweet.

167
00:04:18,426 --> 00:04:19,259
So these are

168
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,092
- [Brothers] Kinder Joy

169
00:04:20,092 --> 00:04:20,925
- Wait,

170
00:04:20,925 --> 00:04:21,758
for girls? - For boys.

171
00:04:21,758 --> 00:04:22,591
- Wait.

172
00:04:22,591 --> 00:04:24,783
(laughing)

173
00:04:24,783 --> 00:04:25,693
- Newsflash!

174
00:04:25,693 --> 00:04:26,738
Devan is a female.

175
00:04:26,738 --> 00:04:27,571
- Really?

176
00:04:27,571 --> 00:04:28,404
- I don't get it.

177
00:04:28,404 --> 00:04:30,126
(laughing)

178
00:04:30,126 --> 00:04:31,374
- Show it!

179
00:04:31,374 --> 00:04:32,841
That really is for boys.

180
00:04:32,841 --> 00:04:34,168
- I'm gonna take a picture on my Snapchat.

181
00:04:34,168 --> 00:04:35,922
And then I'll post that picture here on the screen,

182
00:04:35,922 --> 00:04:37,451
that way you guys can see what it is.

183
00:04:37,451 --> 00:04:38,863
If you guys haven't already added me on Snapchat,

184
00:04:38,863 --> 00:04:39,815
you might as well do that right now.

185
00:04:39,815 --> 00:04:41,012
- If you thought that one was bad,

186
00:04:41,012 --> 00:04:42,412
you should seriously see mine.

187
00:04:42,412 --> 00:04:43,245
- What's yours?

188
00:04:43,245 --> 00:04:44,078
- Look at this.

189
00:04:44,078 --> 00:04:45,036
(laughing)

190
00:04:45,036 --> 00:04:45,869
What?

191
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:47,281
I'm going to take a picture on my Snapchat.

192
00:04:47,281 --> 00:04:48,752
- If you guys don't have Devan on Snapchat,

193
00:04:48,752 --> 00:04:49,931
you might as well add him right now.

194
00:04:49,931 --> 00:04:51,483
- Alright, I'm gonna like pop it inside out.

195
00:04:51,483 --> 00:04:52,359
- It's like an oyster, right?

196
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:53,975
- Oh, you're right; an oyster?

197
00:04:53,975 --> 00:04:54,855
- Okay, the oyster.

198
00:04:54,855 --> 00:04:56,188
Three, two, one.

199
00:04:57,487 --> 00:04:58,469
- Mmm.

200
00:04:58,469 --> 00:04:59,790
Wow!

201
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:00,750
- Mmm!

202
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,583
- That's pretty good.

203
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:02,416
- That was really good!

204
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:03,249
- Wow, that is good.

205
00:05:03,249 --> 00:05:04,082
- That was delicious.

206
00:05:04,082 --> 00:05:04,945
I like this one, very good.

207
00:05:04,945 --> 00:05:07,232
This next one I do not know what these things are.

208
00:05:07,232 --> 00:05:08,845
They are something Warhead.

209
00:05:08,845 --> 00:05:11,349
- Hey, it actually looks like this red thing could be sweet.

210
00:05:11,349 --> 00:05:12,784
- Yeah, I guess you're right.

211
00:05:12,784 --> 00:05:13,617
Yeah.

212
00:05:13,617 --> 00:05:14,578
So this is - I'm hoping.

213
00:05:14,578 --> 00:05:15,541
- I guess, ow!

214
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:16,374
- Oooh.

215
00:05:16,374 --> 00:05:19,092
- First of all, you must lick the red thing.

216
00:05:19,092 --> 00:05:19,925
Dip it in.

217
00:05:19,925 --> 00:05:20,758
- Oh, okay.

218
00:05:20,758 --> 00:05:21,591
- Oh my gosh.

219
00:05:21,591 --> 00:05:22,924
Three, two, one.

220
00:05:27,442 --> 00:05:28,275
- Ha!

221
00:05:29,306 --> 00:05:30,906
- Ooh!

222
00:05:30,906 --> 00:05:31,869
- It's lit.

223
00:05:31,869 --> 00:05:34,019
(laughing)

224
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:35,996
- Alright, I'm gonna go for it again.

225
00:05:35,996 --> 00:05:36,829
- It's on my lips.

226
00:05:36,829 --> 00:05:38,065
- Hoooo-Oooh.

227
00:05:38,065 --> 00:05:39,059
- I'm doing another one.

228
00:05:39,059 --> 00:05:39,892
- Ho!

229
00:05:39,892 --> 00:05:40,725
- Yeah, I just inhaled it.

230
00:05:40,725 --> 00:05:41,952
(laughing)

231
00:05:41,952 --> 00:05:43,132
- We're doing one more guys, you ready?

232
00:05:43,132 --> 00:05:45,382
- Wait, we're all doing it?

233
00:05:46,621 --> 00:05:47,731
(coughing)

234
00:05:47,731 --> 00:05:48,564
- Ha!

235
00:05:48,564 --> 00:05:49,397
- This is a choking hazard.

236
00:05:49,397 --> 00:05:50,230
- I hurt my lips.

237
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,963
My lips are burning - ha!

238
00:05:51,963 --> 00:05:53,415
Ooooh!

239
00:05:53,415 --> 00:05:55,665
(laughing)

240
00:05:56,602 --> 00:05:57,435
It's hot!

241
00:05:58,822 --> 00:06:00,168
It's hot!

242
00:06:00,168 --> 00:06:01,990
I'm sweating!

243
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,127
- Dude, your teeth are all green.

244
00:06:03,127 --> 00:06:04,068
- Yours are too.

245
00:06:04,068 --> 00:06:04,901
- Am I?

246
00:06:04,901 --> 00:06:05,734
(laughing)

247
00:06:05,734 --> 00:06:06,574
Alright, next one, let's go.

248
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:08,199
After that horrible experience,

249
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:11,513
we're gonna eat some pina colada cotton candy.

250
00:06:11,513 --> 00:06:12,658
Take a pinch each.

251
00:06:12,658 --> 00:06:13,649
A pinch!

252
00:06:13,649 --> 00:06:14,823
(laughing) - Alright take it.

253
00:06:14,823 --> 00:06:16,656
- Alright, here we go.

254
00:06:17,938 --> 00:06:19,479
- Hm.

255
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:20,317
- I love cotton candy.

256
00:06:20,317 --> 00:06:21,416
It just like dissolves in your mouth.

257
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:22,249
- It's not bad.

258
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:23,082
- I don't like this flavor, though.

259
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:24,247
- Cotton candy is cotton candy, bro.

260
00:06:24,247 --> 00:06:26,240
(laughing)

261
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,314
- Here, you want some more? - Yeah.

262
00:06:27,314 --> 00:06:28,264
- Here, want some more?

263
00:06:28,264 --> 00:06:29,397
- That's adorable.

264
00:06:29,397 --> 00:06:30,448
- Back to the sour - No!

265
00:06:30,448 --> 00:06:31,554
- with this blue stuff.

266
00:06:31,554 --> 00:06:33,163
Sour Punch Straws.

267
00:06:33,163 --> 00:06:34,555
(laughing)

268
00:06:34,555 --> 00:06:35,388
Alright, here we go, you ready?

269
00:06:35,388 --> 00:06:36,221
Three, two, one.

270
00:06:36,221 --> 00:06:37,054
- Oh, that's sour.

271
00:06:37,054 --> 00:06:39,020
- Ahhhhh my word! - Woah.

272
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,927
(mumbling)

273
00:06:40,927 --> 00:06:41,760
- Oh it's sour.

274
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,314
Alright, so our reward now - Oooh!

275
00:06:43,314 --> 00:06:44,341
- Is Pop Rocks

276
00:06:44,341 --> 00:06:45,174
- Oh sweet. I've done these like

277
00:06:45,174 --> 00:06:46,206
one other time. - So

278
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:47,583
Three, two, one, go.

279
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:48,882
(candy pouring)

280
00:06:48,882 --> 00:06:50,873
(candy crackling)

281
00:06:50,873 --> 00:06:53,685
(all laughing)

282
00:06:53,685 --> 00:06:55,479
(choking)

283
00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:56,312
- God.

284
00:06:56,312 --> 00:06:57,145
- Still popping.

285
00:06:57,145 --> 00:06:58,021
It's not even in my mouth.

286
00:06:58,021 --> 00:06:58,923
It's in my throat.

287
00:06:58,923 --> 00:06:59,897
(laughing)

288
00:06:59,897 --> 00:07:02,163
- They're popping in your throat?

289
00:07:02,163 --> 00:07:02,996
(sizzling sound)

290
00:07:02,996 --> 00:07:03,963
(laughing)

291
00:07:03,963 --> 00:07:05,560
We're just gonna be popping for a little bit now.

292
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,749
- I can feel it right there.

293
00:07:06,749 --> 00:07:07,631
- That is so funny.

294
00:07:07,631 --> 00:07:09,634
- Alright, cool, so let's try the next sour one.

295
00:07:09,634 --> 00:07:11,431
- Next up, we have Toxic Waste.

296
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,467
- Toxic Waste.

297
00:07:12,467 --> 00:07:13,796
I actually have prior experience with these.

298
00:07:13,796 --> 00:07:15,029
I did a video with Mel and - Wait, really?

299
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:16,359
these were also involved, so How were they?

300
00:07:16,359 --> 00:07:17,355
They were great.

301
00:07:17,355 --> 00:07:19,674
Three, two, one, go.

302
00:07:19,674 --> 00:07:23,424
(inarticulate cries of pain)

303
00:07:24,781 --> 00:07:25,614
- No!

304
00:07:26,481 --> 00:07:27,747
Oh!

305
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:28,580
Oh!

306
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,305
- Woo-Hoo-Hoo-Hoo!

307
00:07:30,305 --> 00:07:32,081
- Oh my god.

308
00:07:32,081 --> 00:07:34,071
(inarticulate yell)

309
00:07:34,071 --> 00:07:35,452
- It hurts so bad!

310
00:07:35,452 --> 00:07:38,702
(inarticulate yelling)

311
00:07:41,768 --> 00:07:43,003
- Oh!

312
00:07:43,003 --> 00:07:46,236
(inarticulate yelling)

313
00:07:46,236 --> 00:07:49,591
(screaming and yelling)

314
00:07:49,591 --> 00:07:53,111
- These are way, way worse than I remember.

315
00:07:53,111 --> 00:07:54,125
- This one doesn't get sweet.

316
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,002
- Mom!

317
00:07:55,002 --> 00:07:55,944
- It keeps going.

318
00:07:55,944 --> 00:07:59,531
(inarticulate yelling)

319
00:07:59,531 --> 00:08:00,751
- Okay.

320
00:08:00,751 --> 00:08:02,136
It finally got sweet.

321
00:08:02,136 --> 00:08:04,550
- It really wouldn't.

322
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,806
- Little Devan is in pain.

323
00:08:05,806 --> 00:08:06,875
(choking)

324
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:09,987
(screaming) (laughing)

325
00:08:09,987 --> 00:08:11,237
- Are you okay?

326
00:08:13,108 --> 00:08:15,319
- I'm all sweating, so much.

327
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:19,445
- You know what, all my like water ducts are full.

328
00:08:19,445 --> 00:08:21,028
- Your water yucks?

329
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:23,595
These are horrible.

330
00:08:23,595 --> 00:08:24,718
The worst ones yet.

331
00:08:24,718 --> 00:08:27,477
We gonna need some sweetness to compensate for that one.

332
00:08:27,477 --> 00:08:28,428
And you're literally crying.

333
00:08:28,428 --> 00:08:29,261
- I am.

334
00:08:29,261 --> 00:08:30,117
Oh.

335
00:08:30,117 --> 00:08:31,231
- And these are called macaroons, I believe,

336
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,459
so they are blueberry ones.

337
00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:33,423
- Macaroons!

338
00:08:33,423 --> 00:08:34,256
- Macaroons!

339
00:08:34,256 --> 00:08:35,089
Take a macaroon.

340
00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:35,922
- Oh wait.

341
00:08:35,922 --> 00:08:37,015
- I got you, Devan, don't worry.

342
00:08:37,015 --> 00:08:38,157
Three, two, - I'm popping the whole thing

343
00:08:38,157 --> 00:08:39,670
Yep.

344
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:41,248
Mmm.

345
00:08:41,248 --> 00:08:42,636
- Wow!

346
00:08:42,636 --> 00:08:43,469
- It is really good.

347
00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:44,302
- It is so soft!

348
00:08:44,302 --> 00:08:45,839
- It's like eating cloud.

349
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:46,843
- Yeah!

350
00:08:46,843 --> 00:08:47,727
Alright, so we're gonna try these ones,

351
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:49,185
which literally look like organs.

352
00:08:49,185 --> 00:08:50,476
I'm not even kidding.

353
00:08:50,476 --> 00:08:51,332
Cheers.

354
00:08:51,332 --> 00:08:52,165
These look really weird.

355
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:53,405
They remind me of something body-ish, but I don't know.

356
00:08:53,405 --> 00:08:54,238
Eat it.

357
00:08:54,238 --> 00:08:57,821
(soft dance music playing)

358
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:00,905
Ha!

359
00:09:00,905 --> 00:09:03,155
(laughing)

360
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:06,478
(gasping)

361
00:09:07,317 --> 00:09:09,174
(inarticulate sounds)

362
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:10,007
Woo!

363
00:09:12,933 --> 00:09:13,838
Ew!

364
00:09:13,838 --> 00:09:15,281
- It actually got better.

365
00:09:15,281 --> 00:09:16,988
- Just a little bit.

366
00:09:16,988 --> 00:09:17,821
(inarticulate squak)

367
00:09:17,821 --> 00:09:19,052
- I touched my tongue to my lips.

368
00:09:19,052 --> 00:09:19,885
- Hoo.

369
00:09:19,885 --> 00:09:20,925
- These are just little licorices,

370
00:09:20,925 --> 00:09:22,449
which should be delicious, so.

371
00:09:22,449 --> 00:09:23,759
- I hope they're sweet.

372
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:24,592
- Yeah.

373
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:26,708
Ah.

374
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:27,541
- Oh.

375
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:28,765
- These are good. - Very yummy.

376
00:09:28,765 --> 00:09:30,006
- These are yummy. - Yeah.

377
00:09:30,006 --> 00:09:31,081
- I like these a lot.

378
00:09:31,081 --> 00:09:31,972
- I dig these a lot.

379
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:32,805
- These are really delicious.

380
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:33,721
- Let's get more of these.

381
00:09:33,721 --> 00:09:34,934
- So these are called Sour Twists.

382
00:09:34,934 --> 00:09:36,217
- Nooooo They're made by WarHead.

383
00:09:36,217 --> 00:09:37,399
I'm not excited about this.

384
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:38,502
At all.

385
00:09:38,502 --> 00:09:40,412
(all groaning)

386
00:09:40,412 --> 00:09:41,412
- It smells wrong.

387
00:09:41,412 --> 00:09:42,748
- Oh, singed my nose hairs.

388
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:43,914
- Dude, such babies.

389
00:09:43,914 --> 00:09:45,172
- Two at once.

390
00:09:45,172 --> 00:09:46,368
- Woah, chillax bra.

391
00:09:46,368 --> 00:09:48,329
- Fine, I'll take

392
00:09:48,329 --> 00:09:49,162
five.

393
00:09:49,162 --> 00:09:50,739
- Handful, bras.

394
00:09:50,739 --> 00:09:51,705
- Well, yeah, you can't

395
00:09:51,705 --> 00:09:52,538
- Come at me.

396
00:09:52,538 --> 00:09:53,371
- You're anteing up for me?

397
00:09:53,371 --> 00:09:54,204
- I give up.

398
00:09:54,204 --> 00:09:55,376
- Yeah, you can have the rest.

399
00:09:55,376 --> 00:09:56,209
- Three, - This is it.

400
00:09:56,209 --> 00:09:57,042
Why are we doing this?

401
00:09:57,042 --> 00:09:57,875
- I don't know, go!

402
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:58,896
- Two, I wanted to do one!

403
00:09:58,896 --> 00:10:00,109
Okay.

404
00:10:00,109 --> 00:10:02,172
That was nothing.

405
00:10:02,172 --> 00:10:03,585
- There's no (mumbles) at all.

406
00:10:03,585 --> 00:10:04,801
- Hit me again, bro.

407
00:10:04,801 --> 00:10:06,747
- I can do another handful of these.

408
00:10:06,747 --> 00:10:07,580
- Right.

409
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,552
These ones are rather clever because they look like

410
00:10:08,552 --> 00:10:10,621
little raspberries and blackberries but apparently

411
00:10:10,621 --> 00:10:11,666
they're supposed to be sour.

412
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:13,287
So you're gonna toss it up and then catch it in our mouths.

413
00:10:13,287 --> 00:10:15,073
Three, two, one, go.

414
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:15,906
- Ow.

415
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:17,401
(laughing)

416
00:10:17,401 --> 00:10:18,808
- Three, two, one, go.

417
00:10:18,808 --> 00:10:19,641
- Ayup.

418
00:10:19,641 --> 00:10:20,924
- These aren't gummy at all.

419
00:10:20,924 --> 00:10:21,949
These are awesome.

420
00:10:21,949 --> 00:10:23,164
- Wow, these are really good.

421
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,119
- Or really tasty.

422
00:10:24,119 --> 00:10:25,409
- They were supposed to be sour, but they

423
00:10:25,409 --> 00:10:26,672
are the most delicious ones.

424
00:10:26,672 --> 00:10:27,737
- The most delicious.

425
00:10:27,737 --> 00:10:28,943
- The most delicious.

426
00:10:28,943 --> 00:10:30,536
- Okay, so these are not honey sticks,

427
00:10:30,536 --> 00:10:31,462
these are chocolate

428
00:10:31,462 --> 00:10:32,295
- [Brothers] Sweet

429
00:10:32,295 --> 00:10:33,134
- Honeysticks.

430
00:10:33,134 --> 00:10:33,967
- How do we open them?

431
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:34,818
- Just bite it.

432
00:10:34,818 --> 00:10:35,651
- It's gonna explode.

433
00:10:35,651 --> 00:10:36,599
- Oh, hey it opened.

434
00:10:36,599 --> 00:10:37,558
- Mm.

435
00:10:37,558 --> 00:10:38,439
- Do they taste good?

436
00:10:38,439 --> 00:10:39,336
Not my favorite but, okay.

437
00:10:39,336 --> 00:10:41,072
- I don't think I like it that much.

438
00:10:41,072 --> 00:10:41,905
Eh.

439
00:10:41,905 --> 00:10:42,738
- Eh

440
00:10:43,688 --> 00:10:44,617
- Uh-uh, I don't like it.

441
00:10:44,617 --> 00:10:45,606
- Well, I got a taste of it.

442
00:10:45,606 --> 00:10:47,582
(laughing)

443
00:10:47,582 --> 00:10:48,993
- Yours isn't even open yet.

444
00:10:48,993 --> 00:10:50,209
- Yeah, I'm struggling.

445
00:10:50,209 --> 00:10:53,195
(laughing)

446
00:10:53,195 --> 00:10:54,028
Oh man.

447
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:54,861
Alright, you ready?

448
00:10:54,861 --> 00:10:55,694
- Mm-Hm.

449
00:10:58,441 --> 00:10:59,448
- Oh, it's weird.

450
00:10:59,448 --> 00:11:00,281
(laughing)

451
00:11:00,281 --> 00:11:01,355
It's so strange.

452
00:11:01,355 --> 00:11:03,095
Yo, I can't get enough of that.

453
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:04,376
(laughing)

454
00:11:04,376 --> 00:11:06,683
- So this one here is called Cry Baby Tears.

455
00:11:06,683 --> 00:11:08,100
Extra sour candy.

456
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:11,335
- If they're more sour than the Toxic Waste ones,

457
00:11:11,335 --> 00:11:12,743
I'm scared for my life.

458
00:11:12,743 --> 00:11:14,868
- They're like made in the shape of tears, as well.

459
00:11:14,868 --> 00:11:16,262
That's how bad these things are.

460
00:11:16,262 --> 00:11:17,595
- Oh gosh. You cry on this one,

461
00:11:17,595 --> 00:11:18,601
you the cry baby. - I'm fumbling.

462
00:11:18,601 --> 00:11:20,126
- Three, two, one.

463
00:11:20,126 --> 00:11:23,959
(soft electronic dance music)

464
00:11:27,073 --> 00:11:27,906
- Oh, man.

465
00:11:30,209 --> 00:11:31,456
- Don't you cry baby.

466
00:11:31,456 --> 00:11:32,607
- Hold it back Devan.

467
00:11:32,607 --> 00:11:33,440
You're on camera.

468
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,273
- Be a man.

469
00:11:34,273 --> 00:11:35,358
- Or a line about the cry baby.

470
00:11:35,358 --> 00:11:36,396
There he is.

471
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:39,047
- This one right here, is fish of some sort.

472
00:11:39,047 --> 00:11:40,153
Starfish.

473
00:11:40,153 --> 00:11:41,203
- Starfish.

474
00:11:41,203 --> 00:11:42,036
- They're just stars.

475
00:11:42,036 --> 00:11:42,869
I don't know why they assume they're starfish.

476
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:43,702
- Please be sweet.

477
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:44,535
Please be sweet.

478
00:11:44,535 --> 00:11:45,368
- Yeah, these are sweet ones.

479
00:11:45,368 --> 00:11:46,201
- Wait,

480
00:11:46,201 --> 00:11:47,034
- Oh no, I dropped it - Oh no.

481
00:11:47,034 --> 00:11:47,867
No, in the trash

482
00:11:47,867 --> 00:11:48,700
Oh, pick it up.

483
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,533
It got a little bit dirty.

484
00:11:49,533 --> 00:11:50,568
Oh god, it got really dirty.

485
00:11:50,568 --> 00:11:51,401
Augh.

486
00:11:51,401 --> 00:11:53,401
I'm gonna eat it anyway.

487
00:11:55,642 --> 00:11:56,475
I can't taste anything.

488
00:11:56,475 --> 00:11:57,572
- It tastes terrible.

489
00:11:57,572 --> 00:11:58,911
I've got a super sour one.

490
00:11:58,911 --> 00:12:00,276
- I literally can't taste anything right now.

491
00:12:00,276 --> 00:12:01,375
- Oh, really are you not?

492
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,208
- It's sour!

493
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:05,598
(gasping and yelling)

494
00:12:05,598 --> 00:12:07,079
- Oh!

495
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:07,912
Why? - No!

496
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:11,683
- Tastes like salt.

497
00:12:11,683 --> 00:12:13,850
- I .. it tastes like tar!

498
00:12:15,517 --> 00:12:17,165
It's stuck to my mouth.

499
00:12:17,165 --> 00:12:18,243
It's stuck to my mouth.

500
00:12:18,243 --> 00:12:20,300
- This is the worst!

501
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,190
- Tastes like I'm eating dirt,

502
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:23,084
salty dirt.

503
00:12:23,084 --> 00:12:23,917
(inarticulate yelling)

504
00:12:23,917 --> 00:12:25,750
- It was supposed to be good.

505
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,777
Ew.

506
00:12:26,777 --> 00:12:28,270
I'm gonna throw up.

507
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,609
Please give this video a big thumbs up

508
00:12:29,609 --> 00:12:32,434
for the fact that we ate some of the most sour candy.

509
00:12:32,434 --> 00:12:33,319
- Yup.

510
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:34,384
- And we were in some serious pain,

511
00:12:34,384 --> 00:12:35,418
- Yeah, that was intense.

512
00:12:35,418 --> 00:12:36,993
- Any thumbs up would be much appreciated.

513
00:12:36,993 --> 00:12:37,826
Go check out them both,

514
00:12:37,826 --> 00:12:39,015
I'm gonna put both their social media links

515
00:12:39,015 --> 00:12:40,801
down in the description below, go follow them.

516
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:41,831
- So go do it!

517
00:12:41,831 --> 00:12:42,990
- Right now I'm gonna eat - Can we eat now?

518
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:45,387
- Yeah, I would eat the whole thing.

519
00:12:45,387 --> 00:12:47,014
- Bye!

520
00:12:47,014 --> 00:12:49,730
- Hold on, now let's make him teleport home.

521
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:50,563
- Alright there we go, and you gotta go

522
00:12:50,563 --> 00:12:51,604
bye-bye. - Wait, what?

523
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,437
- Bam.

524
00:12:52,437 --> 00:12:53,546
I'm all alone.
