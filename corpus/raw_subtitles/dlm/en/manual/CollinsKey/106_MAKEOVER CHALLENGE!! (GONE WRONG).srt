1
00:00:00,158 --> 00:00:02,741
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:18,038 --> 00:00:19,871
- Hey, you look great!

3
00:00:20,748 --> 00:00:22,058
Fantastic, really.

4
00:00:22,058 --> 00:00:23,694
- [Collins] I don't think it's the right look.

5
00:00:23,694 --> 00:00:25,445
- Collins, let's just see what it looks like

6
00:00:25,445 --> 00:00:26,558
under the lights, okay?

7
00:00:26,558 --> 00:00:29,558
(upbeat rock music)

8
00:00:40,902 --> 00:00:42,409
- Pose is good, on your mark.

9
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:43,698
- What's up, it's Collins Key,

10
00:00:43,698 --> 00:00:44,897
and for today-- - That was great.

11
00:00:44,897 --> 00:00:47,309
Let's reset for the trick.

12
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:48,707
Get the fire marshal in here.

13
00:00:48,707 --> 00:00:51,077
We're shooting this with the pyrotechnics.

14
00:00:51,077 --> 00:00:53,160
- Has anyone seen Martin?

15
00:00:56,036 --> 00:00:56,928
- I mean how did you do that thing

16
00:00:56,928 --> 00:00:57,966
with the handkerchief and the egg?

17
00:00:57,966 --> 00:00:59,663
That was like insane.

18
00:00:59,663 --> 00:01:01,746
I almost forgot my lines.

19
00:01:07,496 --> 00:01:09,838
But like seriously, how did you do it?

20
00:01:09,838 --> 00:01:11,180
(knocking on door)

21
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,263
- One second.

22
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,119
Oh, hey.

23
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:17,338
- Woah.

24
00:01:17,338 --> 00:01:18,971
- Yeah, I know.

25
00:01:18,971 --> 00:01:21,158
I didn't think you would come.

26
00:01:21,158 --> 00:01:24,482
- I know how important today is to you, so.

27
00:01:24,482 --> 00:01:27,532
Eddie told me you DMed him to apologize.

28
00:01:27,532 --> 00:01:29,325
That was really sweet,

29
00:01:29,325 --> 00:01:32,405
but I came here to actually talk to--

30
00:01:32,405 --> 00:01:33,474
- Hi, I'm Ashley.

31
00:01:33,474 --> 00:01:35,807
I'm playing his best friend.

32
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:39,144
- Would you mind giving us one minute?

33
00:01:39,144 --> 00:01:41,004
- Sure, but I'm gonna get that secret out of you

34
00:01:41,004 --> 00:01:42,525
one way or another, Collin.

35
00:01:42,525 --> 00:01:44,536
- Actually, it's.

36
00:01:44,536 --> 00:01:46,650
(door slams)

37
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,483
Do you wanna sit down?

38
00:01:55,362 --> 00:01:57,144
I'm really sorry I let you down man.

39
00:01:57,144 --> 00:01:59,124
I've been an absolute jerk. - No, don't.

40
00:01:59,124 --> 00:02:00,975
- I get why you're mad.

41
00:02:00,975 --> 00:02:02,938
- No, you don't.

42
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:03,771
I,

43
00:02:05,206 --> 00:02:08,672
I've been thinking, you know about

44
00:02:08,672 --> 00:02:10,513
me and Eddie and,

45
00:02:10,513 --> 00:02:11,374
and you.

46
00:02:11,374 --> 00:02:13,434
- No, and I get that because

47
00:02:13,434 --> 00:02:14,267
you want to be with Eddie,

48
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:15,100
and I'm going to be

49
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,328
way more supportive. - No, no, no, no, no.

50
00:02:16,328 --> 00:02:17,518
That's not what I'm trying

51
00:02:17,518 --> 00:02:18,382
to say. - No, I know

52
00:02:18,382 --> 00:02:19,215
you're trying to say.

53
00:02:19,215 --> 00:02:20,048
What you're trying to say

54
00:02:20,048 --> 00:02:21,319
what you and Eddie have is,

55
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:22,312
it's a real relationship,

56
00:02:22,312 --> 00:02:24,570
and I think that's why I've been

57
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:25,739
so crazy these last few days

58
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:27,188
because it's the first time in my life

59
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,438
that I've actually

60
00:02:28,438 --> 00:02:29,678
had even the opportunity to have

61
00:02:29,678 --> 00:02:31,385
what you and Eddie have.

62
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:33,766
I think I was really falling in love back there.

63
00:02:33,766 --> 00:02:35,065
(soft music)

64
00:02:35,065 --> 00:02:36,315
Now she's gone.

65
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,973
And look, it's just a picture of a trailer.

66
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:44,307
There's no clues, no puzzles.

67
00:02:45,618 --> 00:02:47,035
Time's almost up.

68
00:02:49,943 --> 00:02:52,233
- I just didn't realize

69
00:02:52,233 --> 00:02:55,400
how much you actually cared about her.

70
00:03:03,972 --> 00:03:05,320
What would you do if

71
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,737
you loved someone so much but

72
00:03:08,691 --> 00:03:10,542
you knew something that would mean

73
00:03:10,542 --> 00:03:11,779
that they would be happy,

74
00:03:11,779 --> 00:03:12,878
but it would also mean

75
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:14,811
that they-- - But what?

76
00:03:14,811 --> 00:03:18,728
If you love someone, you want them to be happy.

77
00:03:19,568 --> 00:03:20,401
- Yeah?

78
00:03:27,782 --> 00:03:29,769
I know where she is.

79
00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:30,602
- What?

80
00:03:32,634 --> 00:03:34,580
- She hasn't left L.A.

81
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,825
It's just another clue.

82
00:03:36,825 --> 00:03:39,242
The trailer, you can rent it.

83
00:03:40,465 --> 00:03:41,607
See, now you know.

84
00:03:41,607 --> 00:03:43,441
- God, I love you, you're amazing.

85
00:03:43,441 --> 00:03:44,645
Thank you.

86
00:03:44,645 --> 00:03:47,662
- But before you go, I need to tell you something.

87
00:03:47,662 --> 00:03:50,498
(knocking on door)

88
00:03:50,498 --> 00:03:51,498
- What's up?

89
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,344
- I um.

90
00:03:55,344 --> 00:03:56,242
- [Ashley] Collins?

91
00:03:56,242 --> 00:03:58,457
Collins, they're ready for you.

92
00:03:58,457 --> 00:03:59,639
- You know what, nothing.

93
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:00,913
Just go.

94
00:04:00,913 --> 00:04:02,230
Go, go, go.

95
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,120
- You're the best.

96
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,156
I love you.

97
00:04:04,156 --> 00:04:06,406
All right guys, I'm coming.

98
00:04:08,955 --> 00:04:10,146
(door slams)

99
00:04:10,146 --> 00:04:11,698
- Love you too.

100
00:04:11,698 --> 00:04:14,448
(dramatic music)
