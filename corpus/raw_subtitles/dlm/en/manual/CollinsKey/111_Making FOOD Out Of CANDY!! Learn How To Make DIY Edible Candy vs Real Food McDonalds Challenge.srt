1
00:00:00,065 --> 00:00:02,248
- You challenged us to make food out of candy!

2
00:00:02,248 --> 00:00:03,755
- And this looks so good dude!

3
00:00:03,755 --> 00:00:06,088
(screaming)

4
00:00:08,728 --> 00:00:09,561
- Yo, okay!

5
00:00:09,561 --> 00:00:10,601
We're makin' three different foods,

6
00:00:10,601 --> 00:00:12,183
we're makin' a pizza, an eggs benedict

7
00:00:12,183 --> 00:00:13,851
and a Happy Meal, all out of candy.

8
00:00:13,851 --> 00:00:14,792
So let's go!

9
00:00:14,792 --> 00:00:15,949
Do not take another bite of that.

10
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:16,782
- I won't.

11
00:00:16,782 --> 00:00:19,482
I'm makin' the cheese of my pizza with these marshmallows.

12
00:00:19,482 --> 00:00:20,516
- Grabbin on some Twinkies here

13
00:00:20,516 --> 00:00:22,437
'cause I got to use these as the crust and dough

14
00:00:22,437 --> 00:00:24,435
for my pizza and crust, and dough.

15
00:00:24,435 --> 00:00:25,793
- All right well now I gotta grab

16
00:00:25,793 --> 00:00:27,157
the flat iron here.

17
00:00:27,157 --> 00:00:28,465
- Wait are you actually melting the marshmallow

18
00:00:28,465 --> 00:00:29,433
on an iron, dude?

19
00:00:29,433 --> 00:00:31,377
- Yes, 'cause I have to make sure it drips into the bowl.

20
00:00:31,377 --> 00:00:33,601
- I gotta say, this is either the worst idea you've ever had

21
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:35,476
or the thing that every summer camp in America

22
00:00:35,476 --> 00:00:36,567
is gonna be implementing.

23
00:00:36,567 --> 00:00:37,872
Everyone's got an iron and a marshmallow,

24
00:00:37,872 --> 00:00:38,848
just like this is great!

25
00:00:38,848 --> 00:00:40,152
Just really feel the team spirit, right guys?

26
00:00:40,152 --> 00:00:41,834
Well here we go, gonna mash up all these Twinkies.

27
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:43,851
And this is gonna act as the pizza crust and dough.

28
00:00:43,851 --> 00:00:45,836
- This thing is taking absolutely forever

29
00:00:45,836 --> 00:00:48,145
so I'm just gonna take a second to melt all this stuff down

30
00:00:48,145 --> 00:00:48,978
and I'll be right back.

31
00:00:48,978 --> 00:00:50,332
(elevator music)

32
00:00:50,332 --> 00:00:52,557
And done, finally!

33
00:00:52,557 --> 00:00:54,431
Dude, my arm is so tired.

34
00:00:54,431 --> 00:00:56,107
Uh, Collins, Collins, wake up!

35
00:00:56,107 --> 00:00:57,119
- What what what what?

36
00:00:57,119 --> 00:00:57,975
What's goin' on, we good?

37
00:00:57,975 --> 00:01:00,020
- So I got all of this stuff done finally.

38
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,725
This thing took like an hour I think.

39
00:01:01,725 --> 00:01:03,439
- Yeah, for the dough and baseline of my pizza

40
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:04,652
I'm using a waffle maker.

41
00:01:04,652 --> 00:01:05,843
So here we go, I'm just gonna

42
00:01:05,843 --> 00:01:07,102
drip this into the waffle iron here.

43
00:01:07,102 --> 00:01:08,359
Gonna get it off my hands so this is,

44
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:09,858
oh little plop, little plops!

45
00:01:09,858 --> 00:01:10,691
Good plops.

46
00:01:10,691 --> 00:01:11,985
I got close the top but my hand's a little bit dirty

47
00:01:11,985 --> 00:01:13,155
so, I learned this from MMA!

48
00:01:13,155 --> 00:01:14,081
(shouting)

49
00:01:14,081 --> 00:01:14,914
- Whoa.

50
00:01:14,914 --> 00:01:15,747
- Yeah, elbow strike!

51
00:01:15,747 --> 00:01:16,580
- Okay then. - Okay.

52
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,311
Time to see if my twinkie dough actually worked!

53
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:19,813
Here we go three, two, one!

54
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:20,646
(shouting)

55
00:01:20,646 --> 00:01:21,879
Oh snap! - What?

56
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:23,247
- Yo, look at that, boom!

57
00:01:23,247 --> 00:01:24,348
- Are you kidding? - There we go!

58
00:01:24,348 --> 00:01:26,159
Pizza sauce is comin' along!

59
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,040
- Okay, ya' bumped me.

60
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,873
- I'm sorry. - No bumps.

61
00:01:27,873 --> 00:01:28,706
- All right, no bumps!

62
00:01:28,706 --> 00:01:30,327
I got excited and then I forgot the word and then I bumped.

63
00:01:30,327 --> 00:01:31,160
- Yes. - I bumped again.

64
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,493
No bumping, no bump!

65
00:01:32,493 --> 00:01:34,811
Gonna move the pizza crust off to the side for right now,

66
00:01:34,811 --> 00:01:36,514
and it's time to make the sausages.

67
00:01:36,514 --> 00:01:37,730
These here are gonna be the sausages.

68
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:38,813
Little thing.

69
00:01:40,285 --> 00:01:41,738
- This isn't great at, wow!

70
00:01:41,738 --> 00:01:42,813
- Aw sorry man!

71
00:01:42,813 --> 00:01:44,081
- Well this isn't turning out so well,

72
00:01:44,081 --> 00:01:45,398
so I think I'm gonna put this to the side

73
00:01:45,398 --> 00:01:46,852
save this for a little bit later.

74
00:01:46,852 --> 00:01:48,832
- All right well I got my little balls right here!

75
00:01:48,832 --> 00:01:49,969
Flippin' little balls!

76
00:01:49,969 --> 00:01:50,863
- Look at this dude.

77
00:01:50,863 --> 00:01:52,999
So I made this out of caramel and dough,

78
00:01:52,999 --> 00:01:54,234
it's basically a caramel dough.

79
00:01:54,234 --> 00:01:55,652
I kneaded together a bunch of this caramel,

80
00:01:55,652 --> 00:01:57,640
no no no no, no!

81
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,983
(laughing)

82
00:01:58,983 --> 00:02:00,252
- This is delicious!

83
00:02:00,252 --> 00:02:01,116
- Collin!

84
00:02:01,116 --> 00:02:02,762
I just gotta roll out this dough now.

85
00:02:02,762 --> 00:02:03,746
(squeaking and laughing)

86
00:02:03,746 --> 00:02:05,903
- You weren't supposed to see me yet.

87
00:02:05,903 --> 00:02:06,736
Okay!

88
00:02:06,736 --> 00:02:08,000
- I think you've gone insane!

89
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,665
What are you doing?

90
00:02:09,665 --> 00:02:11,427
- I was trying to become a squirrel, man.

91
00:02:11,427 --> 00:02:13,136
That's gotta be one of my favorite animals, is squirrels.

92
00:02:13,136 --> 00:02:15,619
- But you're not a squirrel Collins, you're a human!

93
00:02:15,619 --> 00:02:16,827
That is kind of low-key terrifying.

94
00:02:16,827 --> 00:02:18,150
- Yeah I gotta say, like,

95
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,174
in my head I was thinkin' that would look

96
00:02:19,174 --> 00:02:21,112
way different than how it actually turned out to be.

97
00:02:21,112 --> 00:02:23,445
- This just in, YouTube wanna-be Collins Key

98
00:02:23,445 --> 00:02:25,565
- Wanna-be, wait why am I? - admits to being a squirrel!

99
00:02:25,565 --> 00:02:28,903
- I'm just so sorry, I just wanna be a squirrel so bad

100
00:02:28,903 --> 00:02:30,921
now I can't be a squirrel!

101
00:02:30,921 --> 00:02:31,754
- [YouTubers] Wow!

102
00:02:31,754 --> 00:02:32,858
- I feel like a fairy god-mother right now

103
00:02:32,858 --> 00:02:33,701
with this little wand man!

104
00:02:33,701 --> 00:02:35,329
- No, you're a fairy god-brother!

105
00:02:35,329 --> 00:02:36,464
- I am now a fairy god-mother!

106
00:02:36,464 --> 00:02:38,271
Boom, there we go, tiara!

107
00:02:38,271 --> 00:02:40,008
Dispute that!

108
00:02:40,008 --> 00:02:41,326
It's un-disputable right now!

109
00:02:41,326 --> 00:02:43,124
- All right, just gotta grab my pizza pan here.

110
00:02:43,124 --> 00:02:43,957
- I will grab it,

111
00:02:43,957 --> 00:02:44,862
but I want another bite! - Whoa whoa whoa!

112
00:02:44,862 --> 00:02:45,695
No, no no no!

113
00:02:45,695 --> 00:02:47,568
I spent time kneading this thing out man!

114
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:49,446
You can't do that.

115
00:02:49,446 --> 00:02:50,664
- I was so close man.

116
00:02:50,664 --> 00:02:52,622
Oh dude check it out bro, it's laser Lenny man!

117
00:02:52,622 --> 00:02:53,455
- Oh, okay.

118
00:02:53,455 --> 00:02:55,199
- Yeah, this is laser Lenny and he is very helpful.

119
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:57,559
Just like Victor the laser pony, they're both kinda related.

120
00:02:57,559 --> 00:02:58,591
Right, laser Lenny here we go!

121
00:02:58,591 --> 00:03:02,587
Oh, three, two, one, yo! - Three, two, one, whoa!

122
00:03:02,587 --> 00:03:04,189
- Oh man! - All right then!

123
00:03:04,189 --> 00:03:05,781
- That's what I'm talkin' about!

124
00:03:05,781 --> 00:03:07,004
Thank you very much laser Lenny,

125
00:03:07,004 --> 00:03:08,358
taser Lenny! - Yeah, whoa no!

126
00:03:08,358 --> 00:03:10,443
- Laser Lenny, taser Lenny! - No, no no no no!

127
00:03:10,443 --> 00:03:12,796
Dude, look at this pizza crust man, lookin' nice!

128
00:03:12,796 --> 00:03:13,748
- That's lookin' pretty incredible man.

129
00:03:13,748 --> 00:03:14,903
All right, so I'm just gonna take this here.

130
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,089
I'm gonna try to like swirl it up into sausage shape.

131
00:03:17,089 --> 00:03:19,636
- I'm gonna use these smarties here as the sauce.

132
00:03:19,636 --> 00:03:22,833
Dude, this is gonna taste so good as a sauce!

133
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:25,473
- All right cool, made this one like a little meatball!

134
00:03:25,473 --> 00:03:26,645
- All right Collins, what is that?

135
00:03:26,645 --> 00:03:27,749
- I was goin' for sausage but it just,

136
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:28,768
it looks so much better as a ball.

137
00:03:28,768 --> 00:03:30,019
- What did you do? - I messed up.

138
00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:32,931
Due to your criticism, of my legit meatball.

139
00:03:32,931 --> 00:03:36,322
I'm doing this but I don't know if it's getting any better.

140
00:03:36,322 --> 00:03:37,333
- It's definitely not.

141
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:39,051
Just gotta spread around this sauce now.

142
00:03:39,051 --> 00:03:41,497
- I got my dough, I just gotta caress the dough lightly.

143
00:03:41,497 --> 00:03:43,115
- Got some candied apples here!

144
00:03:43,115 --> 00:03:45,553
- All right then, woo! - Whoa, hey!

145
00:03:45,553 --> 00:03:49,009
- Gonna use some red icing for the tomato sauce.

146
00:03:49,009 --> 00:03:49,842
Here we go, let's just--

147
00:03:49,842 --> 00:03:50,675
- Collins. - What?

148
00:03:50,675 --> 00:03:51,931
- Do not try this at home!

149
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:54,514
So I'm gonna take one of these caramel-ed apples here.

150
00:03:54,514 --> 00:03:56,046
And this is gonna be for the sauce.

151
00:03:56,046 --> 00:03:57,646
- Okay? - Yes!

152
00:03:57,646 --> 00:03:58,479
- Oh!

153
00:03:58,479 --> 00:03:59,312
- Look at that!

154
00:03:59,312 --> 00:04:00,262
- Don't you already have sauce?

155
00:04:00,262 --> 00:04:02,397
- Yeah, but this is like to add to the sauce Collins.

156
00:04:02,397 --> 00:04:03,951
- [Collins] Dude, you're burning the apple bro!

157
00:04:03,951 --> 00:04:05,193
- [Devan] There will be casualties!

158
00:04:05,193 --> 00:04:07,017
- Its other friends got to go live their half-lives.

159
00:04:07,017 --> 00:04:07,961
- It's organic!

160
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:09,612
- [Collins] It's face looked like he's in pain!

161
00:04:09,612 --> 00:04:10,607
- It's too late now!

162
00:04:10,607 --> 00:04:13,124
(sad music)

163
00:04:13,124 --> 00:04:15,938
- As you do your sauce, I'm gonna spread out my sauce, boom.

164
00:04:15,938 --> 00:04:17,436
- Meltin' this one down now.

165
00:04:17,436 --> 00:04:19,614
- Okay, this one's really really burnt.

166
00:04:19,614 --> 00:04:21,130
You're droppin' literal burnt bits!

167
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:21,963
(shouting)

168
00:04:21,963 --> 00:04:22,979
- Whoa, what?

169
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:24,132
It just blew up?

170
00:04:24,132 --> 00:04:25,747
- Dude you burnt that apple bro!

171
00:04:25,747 --> 00:04:27,085
- All right, we're gonna pretend that that never happened.

172
00:04:27,085 --> 00:04:27,918
- Crisped it!

173
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:28,751
Crisp.

174
00:04:28,751 --> 00:04:29,584
- [Devan] Done with the candy apples.

175
00:04:29,584 --> 00:04:30,417
- Frog legs!

176
00:04:30,417 --> 00:04:32,400
That's what my pizza needs man, frog legs.

177
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,360
- Why? - Check it out here.

178
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,702
He's been behind these bars his whole life,

179
00:04:34,702 --> 00:04:35,659
we gotta free him, here we go.

180
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:37,783
(ululating)

181
00:04:37,783 --> 00:04:39,236
(gasping, coughing)

182
00:04:39,236 --> 00:04:40,069
Sorry.

183
00:04:40,069 --> 00:04:41,817
- Dude this stuff is not comin' outta' here man.

184
00:04:41,817 --> 00:04:43,224
- Ah, there's a hair on my frog!

185
00:04:43,224 --> 00:04:44,213
- This is my marshmallow-- - Is this your hair?

186
00:04:44,213 --> 00:04:45,046
- No, no!

187
00:04:45,975 --> 00:04:47,016
- Sabotage.

188
00:04:47,016 --> 00:04:48,012
Oh did I get it in there? - Where did it go?

189
00:04:48,012 --> 00:04:49,773
Well this is that marshmallow cheese

190
00:04:49,773 --> 00:04:52,036
that I made, and now I'm tryin' to get it out of the bowl!

191
00:04:52,036 --> 00:04:53,157
- You know what my pizza's called?

192
00:04:53,157 --> 00:04:55,523
- No. - Frog on a log!

193
00:04:55,523 --> 00:04:58,076
Bam, there we go, frog on a log pizza.

194
00:04:58,076 --> 00:04:59,468
- Collins can you just grab the bowl here?

195
00:04:59,468 --> 00:05:00,604
Just grab the bowl, just pull it

196
00:05:00,604 --> 00:05:01,486
just pull it, just pull it!

197
00:05:01,486 --> 00:05:03,019
- Where? - Pull it, just back!

198
00:05:03,019 --> 00:05:04,319
- Towards you? - Pull it back!

199
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:05,695
- Towards you. (laughing)

200
00:05:05,695 --> 00:05:06,676
- There we go. - Away from me.

201
00:05:06,676 --> 00:05:08,346
I think I'm just gonna let this drop on there.

202
00:05:08,346 --> 00:05:09,853
All right, the cheese is all spread out.

203
00:05:09,853 --> 00:05:12,133
Now it's time to add a nice golden glow.

204
00:05:12,133 --> 00:05:13,799
- Well now we got this vanilla frosting over here,

205
00:05:13,799 --> 00:05:15,140
gonna add in some yellow color

206
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,407
to hopefully turn it into cheese lookin' stuff.

207
00:05:17,407 --> 00:05:18,754
- [Devan] Oh, this actually works

208
00:05:18,754 --> 00:05:20,220
on the crust too man! - Holy cow!

209
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,610
All right here we go, we got a carrot whisk.

210
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,047
What better way to mix in the color?

211
00:05:23,047 --> 00:05:24,731
- The key is going a little bit slower

212
00:05:24,731 --> 00:05:25,850
than you think you have to.

213
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:26,913
- Yep, couldn't agree more.

214
00:05:26,913 --> 00:05:28,475
Yeah, just a little slower than you have to.

215
00:05:28,475 --> 00:05:30,146
Okay here we go, oh yeah.

216
00:05:30,146 --> 00:05:32,241
Frosting is done!

217
00:05:32,241 --> 00:05:33,260
Time to put it all together.

218
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,642
So here we go, gotta get my little sausage log.

219
00:05:35,642 --> 00:05:36,914
- I just gotta add some pepperoni

220
00:05:36,914 --> 00:05:38,877
and a couple little garnishes, then I'm done with mine.

221
00:05:38,877 --> 00:05:40,652
- And now we gotta complete the unexpected step

222
00:05:40,652 --> 00:05:41,972
that involves a frog and a log,

223
00:05:41,972 --> 00:05:43,602
so, never know how this will go.

224
00:05:43,602 --> 00:05:45,210
We've got the completed candy pizzas

225
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:46,043
and I gotta say.

226
00:05:46,043 --> 00:05:47,638
Yours, if I didn't know that was candy

227
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:49,897
it legit looks like a real pizza, man.

228
00:05:49,897 --> 00:05:52,524
- It is very difficult to not eat this right now.

229
00:05:52,524 --> 00:05:53,357
- I know!

230
00:05:53,357 --> 00:05:54,190
- All right, here we go!

231
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,089
- Three, two--

232
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:56,140
- Five second subscribe challenge!

233
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,549
We wanna see if you can subscribe to the channel

234
00:05:57,549 --> 00:06:00,585
and turn on the channel post notifications in five seconds.

235

236
00:06:01,418 --> 00:06:02,251
Here we go!

237
00:06:02,251 --> 00:06:05,251
- Five, four, three, two, one, done!

238
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:07,538
- If you were able to do that, comment down below

239
00:06:07,538 --> 00:06:09,410
keyper squad right now, and let's see how these look!

240
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,151
- Three, two, one, tah-dah!

241
00:06:12,151 --> 00:06:13,797
(shouting)

242
00:06:13,797 --> 00:06:15,275
- [Collins] Like, if I didn't know that was candy

243
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:17,630
I would straight up think that's a real pizza, man.

244
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,697
- [Devan] I can't wait to eat this.

245
00:06:18,697 --> 00:06:19,947
- [Collins] But you kids comment down below,

246
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:21,409
which one do you think is gonna taste better

247
00:06:21,409 --> 00:06:23,287
and we'll be eatin' them at the end of the video.

248
00:06:23,287 --> 00:06:25,797
You challenged us to make an eggs benedict out of candy.

249
00:06:25,797 --> 00:06:27,747
- Yeah, and I absolutely love these things dude.

250
00:06:27,747 --> 00:06:28,932
- It looks amazing man, looks--

251
00:06:28,932 --> 00:06:29,765
(chomping)

252
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:30,956
What was that?

253
00:06:30,956 --> 00:06:31,917
You popped it off man!

254
00:06:31,917 --> 00:06:33,680
All right so right now let's make it out of candy.

255
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,486
- For my eggs benedict, I'm gonna make this ham stuff first

256
00:06:36,486 --> 00:06:37,634
with these Starbursts.

257
00:06:37,634 --> 00:06:38,752
- All right well see, the thing is

258
00:06:38,752 --> 00:06:39,900
there's three parts to the eggs benedict.

259
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,676
You got the little bun crust on the bottom,

260
00:06:41,676 --> 00:06:43,708
you got the ham stuff, the egg, and then the cha-hives

261
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:45,067
on the top. - Wait what?

262
00:06:45,067 --> 00:06:45,963
- The cha-hives?

263
00:06:45,963 --> 00:06:46,834
- Oh, the chives.

264
00:06:46,834 --> 00:06:47,667
- [Devan] So for the ham

265
00:06:47,667 --> 00:06:49,413
I just have to unwrap all these Starbursts.

266
00:06:49,413 --> 00:06:51,132
- And for the ham I'm using Peeps for mine,

267
00:06:51,132 --> 00:06:51,965
- Wait what? - 'Cause I think

268
00:06:51,965 --> 00:06:52,955
Peeps are gonna make much better ham than,

269
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:54,392
hey hey hey don't touch my Peeps!

270
00:06:54,392 --> 00:06:55,372
I will body you Devan.

271
00:06:55,372 --> 00:06:56,205
- Really?

272
00:06:56,205 --> 00:06:57,038
You wouldn't dare.

273
00:06:57,038 --> 00:06:58,713
(shouting)

274
00:06:58,713 --> 00:07:00,072
- Boom, that's how you get bodied son!

275
00:07:00,072 --> 00:07:02,223
Oh, oh gosh what happened?

276
00:07:02,223 --> 00:07:03,684
- Hah, serves you right bro!

277
00:07:03,684 --> 00:07:04,979
Now you don't have a body.

278
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:05,959
I mean, look at this!

279
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:08,202
- All is not lost because I am a body builder,

280
00:07:08,202 --> 00:07:10,040
and I can build a body out of literally nothing.

281
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,873
- Oh really?

282
00:07:10,873 --> 00:07:12,217
(shouting)

283
00:07:12,217 --> 00:07:14,551
- From scraps to shreds, shredded!

284
00:07:14,551 --> 00:07:16,298
- Where did your other body go?

285
00:07:16,298 --> 00:07:17,131
- Oh.

286
00:07:17,131 --> 00:07:19,970
(whimsical music)

287
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:21,482
Yeah, um.

288
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:22,935
He'll find a home.

289
00:07:22,935 --> 00:07:23,884
He'll find someone.

290
00:07:23,884 --> 00:07:24,717
- That was weird.

291
00:07:24,717 --> 00:07:26,647
All right so I just gotta mold these together

292
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:28,377
because I'm makin' a ham log.

293
00:07:28,377 --> 00:07:29,752
- I thought you just had to make like a piece of ham

294
00:07:29,752 --> 00:07:31,143
for your eggs benedict, not an egg log?

295
00:07:31,143 --> 00:07:32,435
- Yeah, well I have to make the log

296
00:07:32,435 --> 00:07:33,575
then I deli slice it.

297
00:07:33,575 --> 00:07:34,408
- I mean to say ham.

298
00:07:34,408 --> 00:07:36,424
Next up I gotta crush my Peeps to act as the ham,

299
00:07:36,424 --> 00:07:37,690
so here we go, there's only one way

300
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:38,865
to properly crush it Devan.

301
00:07:38,865 --> 00:07:43,039
Gonna have to go here, take a good ol' fashioned knee.

302
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:43,888
- Wow.

303
00:07:43,888 --> 00:07:45,132
The poor Peeps man.

304
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:46,232
- The Peeps aren't that poor man,

305
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:47,509
they're gettin' all crushed by a chair!

306
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,162
(elevator music)

307
00:07:49,162 --> 00:07:50,862
Okay well, there goes another peep.

308
00:07:50,862 --> 00:07:51,843
- Are you kidding? - I was just

309
00:07:51,843 --> 00:07:52,676
trying to crush 'em.

310
00:07:52,676 --> 00:07:53,718
I think these peeps are so dried out.

311
00:07:53,718 --> 00:07:55,732
Look at him, he's like yo, I'm a crusty little man!

312
00:07:55,732 --> 00:07:57,096
- That is not a normal peep!

313
00:07:57,096 --> 00:07:59,025
- It's just a crusty dried out peep!

314
00:07:59,025 --> 00:08:00,220
We're just gonna give him the spoon tap

315
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,957
on the top of the head to tell if he's fresh or not.

316
00:08:01,957 --> 00:08:03,558
This is the peep tester fresher test.

317
00:08:03,558 --> 00:08:05,161
Test whether the peep's fresh.

318
00:08:05,161 --> 00:08:05,994
It's gone.

319
00:08:05,994 --> 00:08:07,033
All right the final thing I gotta do for my ham

320
00:08:07,033 --> 00:08:09,498
is just take this tortilla press.

321
00:08:09,498 --> 00:08:10,697
- Woo!

322
00:08:10,697 --> 00:08:12,308
- All right so here we go, we're gonna place the Peeps

323
00:08:12,308 --> 00:08:13,602
inside this tortilla press,

324
00:08:13,602 --> 00:08:14,933
and again we're tryin' to make ham.

325
00:08:14,933 --> 00:08:17,415
Yeah, there we go peep yeah!

326
00:08:17,415 --> 00:08:18,794
- I might do this somewhere else.

327
00:08:18,794 --> 00:08:19,652
- Here we go, let's just.

328
00:08:19,652 --> 00:08:21,189
- Open up the Peeps, man. - Crack a peep!

329
00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:23,013
Cracked a peep, there.

330
00:08:23,013 --> 00:08:23,846
- Peep those.

331
00:08:23,846 --> 00:08:25,571
- We got some

332
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:27,821
some long strawberry laces.

333
00:08:28,725 --> 00:08:30,031
And just gonna plop 'em out.

334
00:08:30,031 --> 00:08:30,864
- Yeah! - Nice catch.

335
00:08:30,864 --> 00:08:32,251
- Look at that! - It's like a wig!

336
00:08:32,251 --> 00:08:33,084
It's a wig,

337
00:08:33,084 --> 00:08:34,469
it's a wig, it's a wig! - Okay yeah, sure.

338
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:36,701
- Hi, I'm Wendy, from the Wendy's fast food restaurant!

339
00:08:36,701 --> 00:08:38,194
And I'm a savage on Twitter man!

340
00:08:38,194 --> 00:08:39,952
I roast people like there's no tomorrow bro!

341
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:41,286
My Twitter account is lit!

342
00:08:41,286 --> 00:08:42,720
- So it was you behind those tweets!

343
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,701
- Oh yeah, man!

344
00:08:43,701 --> 00:08:44,969
This is the new Wendy!

345
00:08:44,969 --> 00:08:47,159
I'm window man, I'm like a window then I bam,

346
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:48,181
shatter that window!

347
00:08:48,181 --> 00:08:49,534
- Okay, I'm gonna take this off you now.

348
00:08:49,534 --> 00:08:51,176
- Yeah, sorry that's changed me a little bit.

349
00:08:51,176 --> 00:08:52,597
Makin' my ham over here so here we go,

350
00:08:52,597 --> 00:08:54,432
gonna continue winding these ropes around.

351
00:08:54,432 --> 00:08:56,096
It's gonna take a lot of technical skill

352
00:08:56,096 --> 00:08:57,447
in chef culinary business.

353
00:08:57,447 --> 00:08:58,641
- All right, whoa!

354
00:08:58,641 --> 00:09:00,963
I'm done with this thing now, I just have to wrap it

355
00:09:00,963 --> 00:09:01,935
in some other stuff.

356
00:09:01,935 --> 00:09:03,123
I don't know what I'm gonna wrap it in though.

357
00:09:03,123 --> 00:09:04,345
Ooh, no.

358
00:09:04,345 --> 00:09:05,390
- Sounded very excited for a second.

359
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,459
- I got really excited.

360
00:09:06,459 --> 00:09:07,733
Fruit Loops? - Ooh, that's a good idea.

361
00:09:07,733 --> 00:09:08,776
- I don't think I can do Fruit Loops.

362
00:09:08,776 --> 00:09:09,609
- Well you know as you do that,

363
00:09:09,609 --> 00:09:10,622
as you can tell I put this red licorice stuff

364
00:09:10,622 --> 00:09:11,895
around the outside so the goal--

365
00:09:11,895 --> 00:09:13,036
- I can tell that, that was good.

366
00:09:13,036 --> 00:09:14,186
- Here we go, gonna go back down now.

367
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:15,095
- Wait, I'm gonna do these.

368
00:09:15,095 --> 00:09:16,103
- Okay.

369
00:09:16,103 --> 00:09:16,936
- What?

370
00:09:16,936 --> 00:09:17,769
- I have failed.

371
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:19,822
- My Starburst ham log has been wrapped

372
00:09:19,822 --> 00:09:22,920
in this Airheads stuff here, and now I'm gonna slice it.

373
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,474
All right turning it on now, time to slice it!

374
00:09:25,474 --> 00:09:28,533
(shouting)

375
00:09:28,533 --> 00:09:30,206
- How am I supposed to compete with this?

376
00:09:30,206 --> 00:09:31,987
I've got some of these big ol' marshmallows.

377
00:09:31,987 --> 00:09:33,770
Look at this bro, I'm like a marshmallow man.

378
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,401
(bouncy music and grunting)

379
00:09:35,401 --> 00:09:38,008
Why aren't you dancing Devan, come on bro!

380
00:09:38,008 --> 00:09:39,342
- I'm not about this song, man.

381
00:09:39,342 --> 00:09:40,544
- Okay but Devan Devan, pause, okay.

382
00:09:40,544 --> 00:09:42,013
- Doesn't seem like a club song.

383
00:09:42,013 --> 00:09:42,989
- Cut the music for a second.

384
00:09:42,989 --> 00:09:43,977
- This doesn't seem like a club song.

385
00:09:43,977 --> 00:09:45,441
- Devan please, I need you to dance with me.

386
00:09:45,441 --> 00:09:46,922
- It's like you're trying to hypnotize me.

387
00:09:46,922 --> 00:09:47,755
- I am. - Look into the camera

388
00:09:47,755 --> 00:09:48,593
with these eyes.

389
00:09:48,593 --> 00:09:52,002
- Please, please, if you're watching at home, dance with me!

390
00:09:52,002 --> 00:09:52,935
Three, two, one!

391
00:09:52,935 --> 00:09:53,917
(bouncy music)

392
00:09:53,917 --> 00:09:55,133
'Cause you're not dancing Devan,

393
00:09:55,133 --> 00:09:57,097
boom, little marshmallow arms comin' out of your head.

394
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,563
They will dance for you. - Are you kidding me?

395
00:09:58,563 --> 00:10:00,549
I'm gonna use some white Reece's Peanut Butter Cups

396
00:10:00,549 --> 00:10:02,073
right here to make the egg.

397
00:10:02,073 --> 00:10:03,442
- [Collins] It's probably gonna seem a little weird now,

398
00:10:03,442 --> 00:10:04,470
oh man.

399
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,476
(laughing)

400
00:10:05,476 --> 00:10:06,635
- So that was just the first part of my egg.

401
00:10:06,635 --> 00:10:07,989
Did you just really just throw that?

402
00:10:07,989 --> 00:10:08,822
- All right so here we go,

403
00:10:08,822 --> 00:10:10,131
we're gonna take these three little buddies right over here,

404
00:10:10,131 --> 00:10:11,013
we're gonna squish 'em up.

405
00:10:11,013 --> 00:10:13,082
This guy's name is Fred, he's George, and Wapow!

406
00:10:13,082 --> 00:10:14,181
- Why is his name Wapow bro?

407
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:16,460
- His name is Wapow because Wapow!

408
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,293
- Oh.

409
00:10:17,293 --> 00:10:18,126
- We gotta get some egg yolk next,

410
00:10:18,126 --> 00:10:19,474
these lemon thingies here are gonna be perfect.

411
00:10:19,474 --> 00:10:20,997
So here we go, just gonna grab a couple of 'em here.

412
00:10:20,997 --> 00:10:22,565
Let's just uh, let's dump 'em out.

413
00:10:22,565 --> 00:10:25,617
Okay here we go, there, it's now stuck to oh boy, this is.

414
00:10:25,617 --> 00:10:26,457
- You did a good job, yeah.

415
00:10:26,457 --> 00:10:28,395
- I'm sorry in advance.

416
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:30,106
There we go, one left.

417
00:10:30,106 --> 00:10:31,357
- This is a rare occasion Collins.

418
00:10:31,357 --> 00:10:32,190
- What?

419
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:33,045
- It didn't fall in my stuff.

420
00:10:33,045 --> 00:10:33,913
- Oh, that's nice!

421
00:10:33,913 --> 00:10:35,121
All right so here we go, this is going to be--

422
00:10:35,121 --> 00:10:36,746
- Wait, you should try one, you should try one.

423
00:10:36,746 --> 00:10:37,752
- Hold on, do you just wanna bite that with your teeth?

424
00:10:37,752 --> 00:10:39,814
- You're like Spiderman, what no.

425
00:10:39,814 --> 00:10:41,747
(laughing)

426
00:10:41,747 --> 00:10:42,851
- Oh, it was you!

427
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:44,354
- No! - It was you!

428
00:10:44,354 --> 00:10:46,562
- Why! - You did that to yourself!

429
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:47,407
Devan what does that mean - Oh man!

430
00:10:47,407 --> 00:10:48,777
- For yourself and your life?

431
00:10:48,777 --> 00:10:51,059
- It's a defining moment, it's a sad moment for me.

432
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:52,371
- Tell us Devan, how are you feeling right now

433
00:10:52,371 --> 00:10:53,960
in this deep moment of despair?

434
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,659
- It's probably the most disappointing moment of my life.

435
00:10:55,659 --> 00:10:56,629
- Forget how you're feeling,

436
00:10:56,629 --> 00:10:58,586
how are you feeling that Devan screwed you over so bad?

437
00:10:58,586 --> 00:10:59,616
- It's embarrassing.

438
00:10:59,616 --> 00:11:00,449
- Back to you.

439
00:11:00,449 --> 00:11:01,282
- It's embarrassing.

440
00:11:01,282 --> 00:11:03,096
- This has been a tragic day for both Devan

441
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:04,705
and his little thing over there.

442
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:05,538
- What, no no no.

443
00:11:05,538 --> 00:11:06,909
- Back to you Patricia!

444
00:11:06,909 --> 00:11:07,742
All right so here we go,

445
00:11:07,742 --> 00:11:09,470
gonna take the little lemon, little dude.

446
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,405
(laughing)

447
00:11:10,405 --> 00:11:11,289
That laugh.

448
00:11:11,289 --> 00:11:12,138
(mock laughing)

449
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:13,970
- [Devan] I am capping this off right now.

450
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:16,203
- The final thing we need to make is the avocado toast!

451
00:11:16,203 --> 00:11:17,146
- It's been a while since

452
00:11:17,146 --> 00:11:18,056
we've had one of these, man, I am excited!

453
00:11:18,056 --> 00:11:19,294
- Yeah, that is way cooler than mine.

454
00:11:19,294 --> 00:11:21,213
Wait wait wait wait! - What what what?

455
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:23,482
- Devan this is a great time for Wapow Key!

456
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:25,661
(rock music)

457
00:11:25,661 --> 00:11:27,028
- Three, two, one!

458
00:11:27,028 --> 00:11:29,064
- Wapow Key, Ow Key, Ow Key!

459
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:30,856
(rock music)

460
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:33,657
Here we go, we got a whole box of Little Debbie's!

461
00:11:33,657 --> 00:11:34,490
Little Debbie.

462
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:35,323
So this here is going to be the--

463
00:11:35,323 --> 00:11:37,714
(crinkling)

464
00:11:37,714 --> 00:11:39,602
There we go, so this here is going to be the bread

465
00:11:39,602 --> 00:11:40,780
of my avocado toast.

466
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:43,397
- I'm gonna use some real bread here as my stencil.

467
00:11:43,397 --> 00:11:44,732
- Hold up, that's cheating man!

468
00:11:44,732 --> 00:11:47,150
You can't use a real slice of bread Devan, use your noggin.

469
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:47,983
- I'll do it to you.

470
00:11:47,983 --> 00:11:49,660
- Yeah, yeah!

471
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,495
- The bread unicorn.

472
00:11:50,495 --> 00:11:51,372
- Okay, it's pulsating.

473
00:11:51,372 --> 00:11:52,740
Oh, no, I know what this means, I know what this means!

474
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,841
- Oh, okay! - No no no,

475
00:11:53,841 --> 00:11:54,674
- No!

476
00:11:55,571 --> 00:11:56,799
- Whoa! - Holy cow!

477
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,875
Dude, I almost became one with the universe again!

478
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:01,054
No bread, fleet there we go it's gone.

479
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,761
- I'll be right back.

480
00:12:02,761 --> 00:12:04,153
There's some bread for ya' bro!

481
00:12:04,153 --> 00:12:06,034
- Little Debbie says nope!

482
00:12:06,034 --> 00:12:06,867
- Are you kidding?

483
00:12:06,867 --> 00:12:08,780
- Fine, well Devan's gonna go retrieve it.

484
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,287
Devan now has to do the unthinkable.

485
00:12:10,287 --> 00:12:12,008
He's gotta retrieve--

486
00:12:12,008 --> 00:12:14,061
That was close, I will call it a truce, a truce, a truce?

487
00:12:14,061 --> 00:12:15,061
- All right.

488
00:12:16,405 --> 00:12:18,000
(laughing)

489
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,013
It's a bread truce.

490
00:12:19,013 --> 00:12:19,846
- What?

491
00:12:19,846 --> 00:12:22,307
- I'm gonna sit on this bread so you don't steal it.

492
00:12:22,307 --> 00:12:24,706
- You know what man, I think this one's special bro.

493
00:12:24,706 --> 00:12:26,794
I think it has the soul of Little Debbie in it.

494
00:12:26,794 --> 00:12:27,627
- What?

495
00:12:27,627 --> 00:12:28,943
Dude, you're gettin' crazy man.

496
00:12:28,943 --> 00:12:31,994
- No no no, check it out here we go, three, two, one, yo!

497
00:12:31,994 --> 00:12:33,316
Look it, it's Little Debbie!

498
00:12:33,316 --> 00:12:36,149
She's come back, and she's in the form of one of her rolls!

499
00:12:36,149 --> 00:12:37,839
Look at her man, she's cruisin' all about.

500
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,771
Oh man, she's gone, what was that?

501
00:12:39,771 --> 00:12:41,147
- Oh man, where did she go?

502
00:12:41,147 --> 00:12:42,141
- You know what it all makes sense, Devan.

503
00:12:42,141 --> 00:12:42,974
- Oh it does?

504
00:12:42,974 --> 00:12:46,946
- She has transcended, with the rest of her Ding Dongs.

505
00:12:46,946 --> 00:12:47,779
- What?

506
00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:48,612
Look at that!

507
00:12:48,612 --> 00:12:49,445
It's a piece of bread, man.

508
00:12:49,445 --> 00:12:50,409
- It kinda looks like a little mound.

509
00:12:50,409 --> 00:12:52,115
- Whoa, hey now, okay no you can't.

510
00:12:52,115 --> 00:12:54,160
- Okay so here we go, we got some Cool Whip.

511
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,412
We're gonna take the Jell-O cups like this

512
00:12:55,412 --> 00:12:57,248
and then here we go we're just gonna deposit 'em on top.

513
00:12:57,248 --> 00:12:58,081
Let's see this.

514
00:12:58,081 --> 00:12:59,998
- Yeah, piece of bread number two!

515
00:12:59,998 --> 00:13:01,624
I don't know why I made two pieces of bread,

516
00:13:01,624 --> 00:13:02,576
I only wanted one.

517
00:13:02,576 --> 00:13:04,102
Well, I guess this'll be for a friend.

518
00:13:04,102 --> 00:13:05,464
Or maybe you, Collins, you might want this?

519
00:13:05,464 --> 00:13:06,297
- I'm not your friend.

520
00:13:06,297 --> 00:13:07,415
- I'm gonna take the fruit by the foot,

521
00:13:07,415 --> 00:13:08,648
put it on the outside here.

522
00:13:08,648 --> 00:13:09,842
Hope it doesn't taste like a foot.

523
00:13:09,842 --> 00:13:10,675
(laughing)

524
00:13:10,675 --> 00:13:11,822
- [Collins] Okay there we go, just mix it all up.

525
00:13:11,822 --> 00:13:13,661
And again this right here is to create the guacamole.

526
00:13:13,661 --> 00:13:15,370
- [Devan] I'm gonna use these mint Oreos

527
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:16,815
for the avocado of mine, bro.

528
00:13:16,815 --> 00:13:18,469
- Dude, that, compared to that.

529
00:13:18,469 --> 00:13:19,673
It's like that meme of like

530
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:21,813
you versus the guy she tells you not to worry about.

531
00:13:21,813 --> 00:13:22,742
I am concerned!

532
00:13:22,742 --> 00:13:24,510
You know what man, I gotta say, my avocado

533
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,764
is actually coming together rather nicely right now.

534
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,229
So here we go, I'm just gonna grab my piece of bread

535
00:13:28,229 --> 00:13:29,062
'cause it's finally time.

536
00:13:29,062 --> 00:13:29,895
- I forgot I gave that to you.

537
00:13:29,895 --> 00:13:30,728
- Yep, thank you very much.

538
00:13:30,728 --> 00:13:31,704
- I almost got a little bit territorial.

539
00:13:31,704 --> 00:13:33,096
- My avocado toast is all done

540
00:13:33,096 --> 00:13:35,306
and now it is time to compile our egg McMuffin!

541
00:13:35,306 --> 00:13:37,448
It's not a flippin' egg McMuffin, what is it?

542
00:13:37,448 --> 00:13:38,281
Benedict!

543
00:13:38,281 --> 00:13:40,073
Eggs benedict, time to compile it right now,

544
00:13:40,073 --> 00:13:41,338
put it all together, reveal it

545
00:13:41,338 --> 00:13:42,728
and then see how it tastes!

546
00:13:42,728 --> 00:13:44,485
We've got the finished candy eggs benedict,

547
00:13:44,485 --> 00:13:46,428
and they look absolutely insane!

548
00:13:46,428 --> 00:13:48,101
We added a hollandaise sauce on it,

549
00:13:48,101 --> 00:13:50,122
and you've got cookies as the base of yours!

550
00:13:50,122 --> 00:13:51,918
Here is the big reveal, you ready?

551
00:13:51,918 --> 00:13:52,751
- Three, two.

552
00:13:52,751 --> 00:13:53,744
- Three second like challenge!

553
00:13:53,744 --> 00:13:55,950
We wanna see if you can like this video in three seconds!

554
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:56,785
You ready?

555
00:13:56,785 --> 00:13:57,618
Here we go!

556
00:13:57,618 --> 00:13:59,532
- Three, two, one, done!

557
00:13:59,532 --> 00:14:01,449
Three, two, one, ta-da!

558
00:14:02,444 --> 00:14:03,696
- Yes! - Oh my gosh!

559
00:14:03,696 --> 00:14:05,596
- I am salivating! - They look so good!

560
00:14:05,596 --> 00:14:06,726
You get to comment down below,

561
00:14:06,726 --> 00:14:08,274
which one do you think will taste better?

562
00:14:08,274 --> 00:14:09,831
And we'll be eating them at the end of the video.

563
00:14:09,831 --> 00:14:10,891
You challenged us to make

564
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,889
a McDonalds Happy Meal out of candy, man!

565
00:14:12,889 --> 00:14:13,773
(shouting)

566
00:14:13,773 --> 00:14:14,606
- What is it doing?

567
00:14:14,606 --> 00:14:15,615
(screaming)

568
00:14:15,615 --> 00:14:17,414
Oh, dude! - I freaked out so bad!

569
00:14:17,414 --> 00:14:18,247
- What!

570
00:14:18,247 --> 00:14:19,305
- I've literally broken my chair.

571
00:14:19,305 --> 00:14:23,161
It's now a recliner chair, 'cause can your chair do this?

572
00:14:23,161 --> 00:14:24,481
Oh, that's uncomfortable.

573
00:14:24,481 --> 00:14:26,609
And that's enough, so right now let's make some Happy Meals.

574
00:14:26,609 --> 00:14:29,142
- Well I'm actually making my Coca-Cola bottle hollow

575
00:14:29,142 --> 00:14:31,556
so I can add in other candies into the middle of it.

576
00:14:31,556 --> 00:14:33,886
Dude, this thing can take like an entire skittles bag.

577
00:14:33,886 --> 00:14:35,997
It's like the endless Coca-Cola bottle.

578
00:14:35,997 --> 00:14:37,882
The next thing I have to do is cut the bottle

579
00:14:37,882 --> 00:14:39,015
off of the chocolate.

580
00:14:39,015 --> 00:14:40,626
- All right, I'm makin' my burger patty right now.

581
00:14:40,626 --> 00:14:42,298
I've got some carrot cake Oreos.

582
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,059
Yeah, Devan needs to be very concentrated right now.

583
00:14:44,059 --> 00:14:46,339
- Now it's time to remove the bottle, here we go!

584
00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:47,172
Look at this.

585
00:14:47,172 --> 00:14:48,063
- Holy cow!

586
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,406
You pop the bottom off,

587
00:14:49,406 --> 00:14:51,210
those Skittles is gonna fly on out dude.

588
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:52,161
You got this Devan!

589
00:14:52,161 --> 00:14:53,946
- No, I don't, I don't know! - You got this!

590
00:14:53,946 --> 00:14:55,061
Help him out with a little sweat.

591
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:55,894
- Thank you!

592
00:14:55,894 --> 00:14:56,888
- Refresh our athletes here!

593
00:14:56,888 --> 00:14:58,077
- Mm, thank you.

594
00:14:58,077 --> 00:14:59,457
Back in, and I'm back in the game!

595
00:14:59,457 --> 00:15:00,929
- Devan, I think the only thing you can do.

596
00:15:00,929 --> 00:15:03,194
Suck a Jell-O cup.

597
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:04,027
- Definitely not.

598
00:15:04,027 --> 00:15:04,860
I think I almost got it!

599
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:05,693
- Sure you don't wanna suck it?

600
00:15:05,693 --> 00:15:06,526
- I'm positive.

601
00:15:06,526 --> 00:15:07,359
Yes, I got it!

602
00:15:07,359 --> 00:15:08,192
- Again, this is gonna

603
00:15:08,192 --> 00:15:09,580
make the burger patty for my burger, so.

604
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,953
- Oh, look at this!

605
00:15:10,953 --> 00:15:12,291
- Forget that, look at this!

606
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:13,651
- No, forget that, look at this!

607
00:15:13,651 --> 00:15:15,311
- No, forget that, look at this!

608
00:15:15,311 --> 00:15:17,368
- No, forget that, look at this!

609
00:15:17,368 --> 00:15:18,491
- Oh my gosh!

610
00:15:18,491 --> 00:15:20,586
(screaming)

611
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:21,857
Oh dude, it's a fake weight!

612
00:15:21,857 --> 00:15:22,690
- I know right?

613
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,418
- You scared me so bad!

614
00:15:24,418 --> 00:15:25,555
(screaming)

615
00:15:25,555 --> 00:15:26,979
Time to make my burger, and we gotta of course

616
00:15:26,979 --> 00:15:28,237
start off with my Honey Buns,

617
00:15:28,237 --> 00:15:30,181
my sweet buns, the buns of sweetest.

618
00:15:30,181 --> 00:15:31,014
Oh yeah.

619
00:15:32,303 --> 00:15:33,310
What are you up to?

620
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:34,584
- [Devan] Oh, this is the cheese Collins!

621
00:15:34,584 --> 00:15:35,417
- That's the cheese?

622
00:15:35,417 --> 00:15:36,250
Yeet, fleet, beat!

623
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,542
Okay, so we got here with us--

624
00:15:37,542 --> 00:15:38,508
- Do not try this at home.

625
00:15:38,508 --> 00:15:40,460
- Oh, look at this, here we go look at this.

626
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,023
Let me just move that for one second.

627
00:15:42,023 --> 00:15:42,856
- Oh, my elbow?

628
00:15:42,856 --> 00:15:43,995
- It blocked the shot, here we go here we go.

629
00:15:43,995 --> 00:15:45,250
(humming)

630
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,083
Fleet!

631
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:47,629
For the ketchup I've got some jelly filled donuts

632
00:15:47,629 --> 00:15:48,462
right here man! - Oh, wow!

633
00:15:48,462 --> 00:15:49,508
- So here's what I'm gonna do. - Wow!

634
00:15:49,508 --> 00:15:51,791
- Yeah, these look incredible bro.

635
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:52,685
- Whoa! - Glossy!

636
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:53,797
Gonna squeeze it out and try to get

637
00:15:53,797 --> 00:15:55,480
a healthy adding of jelly.

638
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:00,084
Oh, there we go there we go, ooh yeah boy there we go!

639
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,045
The more I look at this, the more excited I'm getting

640
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:03,999
for how this is going to taste.

641
00:16:03,999 --> 00:16:06,067
- All right, well this here is the bottom of my bun.

642
00:16:06,067 --> 00:16:07,802
I took some of these things, combined 'em,

643
00:16:07,802 --> 00:16:09,498
put 'em in the microwave, and got this.

644
00:16:09,498 --> 00:16:12,040
- I don't think your burger bun holds up to my sweetie buns!

645
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:12,950
- They're Honey Buns, bro.

646
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,579
- Honey Buns, whoops.

647
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:16,720
Next thing I gotta use over here is some lettuce!

648
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,197
So here we go this is lettuce I made earlier.

649
00:16:18,197 --> 00:16:20,210
I made a couple extra ones, ah still dripping with water!

650
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:21,543
Sorry, I overreacted.

651
00:16:21,543 --> 00:16:26,073
Remember, this is edible delicious candy wax from this bag!

652
00:16:26,073 --> 00:16:28,426
- I need to make my french fries next Collins.

653
00:16:28,426 --> 00:16:29,464
- Here we go, boom. - That looks weird.

654
00:16:29,464 --> 00:16:30,881
- Lettuce, added!

655
00:16:31,933 --> 00:16:33,369
(laughing)

656
00:16:33,369 --> 00:16:34,956
Yeah, that's a move. - No!

657
00:16:34,956 --> 00:16:35,789
I don't think so.

658
00:16:35,789 --> 00:16:37,331
- That's a power move right there bro.

659
00:16:37,331 --> 00:16:40,241
The thing is this is the lettuce to bun ratio you want, man!

660
00:16:40,241 --> 00:16:41,124
- Are you sure, dude?

661
00:16:41,124 --> 00:16:42,787
I feel like most people take off the lettuce, you know?

662
00:16:42,787 --> 00:16:45,017
- Are you kidding me, no one takes off this lettuce man!

663
00:16:45,017 --> 00:16:46,418
This lettuce will take you off!

664
00:16:46,418 --> 00:16:47,251
- Okay.

665
00:16:47,251 --> 00:16:48,420
- So here we go, gonna place it right there.

666
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,591
Boom, oh, beautiful.

667
00:16:50,591 --> 00:16:53,294
Gonna add a little bit of ketchup on the top here like this.

668
00:16:53,294 --> 00:16:54,460
Boom, bam.

669
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:56,587
Gonna place another bun on top like this, bam.

670
00:16:56,587 --> 00:16:58,223
There we go, you think that's the end of the burger

671
00:16:58,223 --> 00:16:59,223
but it's not!

672
00:16:59,223 --> 00:17:00,312
- [Devan] I don't really enjoy doing this

673
00:17:00,312 --> 00:17:01,926
but I gotta do it for the art, man.

674
00:17:01,926 --> 00:17:03,388
- You seem like you're turning into me right now.

675
00:17:03,388 --> 00:17:04,221
- Kind of.

676
00:17:04,221 --> 00:17:05,054
This is gonna be amazing dude,

677
00:17:05,054 --> 00:17:07,354
this is gonna be a potato that I turn into my french fries.

678
00:17:07,354 --> 00:17:08,778
- That potato looks delicious.

679
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:10,272
Next up here we go, we got some Jell-O.

680
00:17:10,272 --> 00:17:12,490
This is gonna act as the tomato slices for my burger.

681
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,730
Gonna get some slices of them tomato

682
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:15,731
here on the top of mine, let's see like this.

683
00:17:15,731 --> 00:17:16,564
Shoomp?

684
00:17:16,564 --> 00:17:17,397
Where'd it go?

685
00:17:17,397 --> 00:17:19,289
- Dude, this turned out better than I ever could've hoped!

686
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:20,850
Look at this thing, it's like a potato!

687
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:21,850
- Oh, oh no.

688
00:17:22,874 --> 00:17:24,514
- Looks like you're havin' some troubles over there bro.

689
00:17:24,514 --> 00:17:25,347
- Many.

690
00:17:25,347 --> 00:17:26,940
- I've got my french fry maker right here,

691
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,384
and I'm gonna put a nice little potato in there.

692
00:17:29,384 --> 00:17:30,605
Here we go, three, two, one.

693
00:17:30,605 --> 00:17:31,438
- [Collins] You're gonna make french fries?

694
00:17:31,438 --> 00:17:32,271
- [Devan] Hopefully.

695
00:17:32,271 --> 00:17:33,779
- [Youtubers] Aww.

696
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:35,182
- I mean, made little short fries?

697
00:17:35,182 --> 00:17:37,478
Yo, let me see, ah my lettuce!

698
00:17:37,478 --> 00:17:39,813
- That was a really loud yell in my ear.

699
00:17:39,813 --> 00:17:40,971
You were like right there!

700
00:17:40,971 --> 00:17:42,679
Oh, I mean it kinda worked?

701
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:43,728
- Yeah, I think if you tried it a couple more times

702
00:17:43,728 --> 00:17:45,110
you probably would be able to get some long ones.

703
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,031
- I think so. - So right now,

704
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:47,504
it is time for us to finish up our burgers

705
00:17:47,504 --> 00:17:49,489
make all the final elements, put 'em together,

706
00:17:49,489 --> 00:17:51,455
and then see how they taste so let's do it!

707
00:17:51,455 --> 00:17:53,029
We've got the completed candy burgers,

708
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:55,944
and I gotta say man, yours looks spot on realistic bro!

709
00:17:55,944 --> 00:17:56,777
- I know, right?

710
00:17:56,777 --> 00:17:58,207
- For better or worse, Devan.

711
00:17:58,207 --> 00:17:59,152
- Wait, what does that mean?

712
00:17:59,152 --> 00:18:00,586
- Mine is kinda like the commercial, man.

713
00:18:00,586 --> 00:18:03,063
Like it looks absolutely pristine and beautiful.

714
00:18:03,063 --> 00:18:04,431
So here is the big reveal!

715
00:18:04,431 --> 00:18:05,899
- Three, two, oh wait!

716
00:18:05,899 --> 00:18:07,347
- If you wanna win a 15 minute video call

717
00:18:07,347 --> 00:18:10,909
with Devan and I, text the word candy to 81800 right now!

718
00:18:10,909 --> 00:18:12,840
So pause the video, text the word candy

719
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,028
to 81800, and you'll automatically be entered in to win.

720
00:18:15,028 --> 00:18:16,386
So right now, let's take a look at this.

721
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:19,198
- Three, two, one, ta-da!

722
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:21,137
- Look at that man! - Yeah, so good!

723
00:18:21,137 --> 00:18:22,596
- [Devan] I think you might-a won this one!

724
00:18:22,596 --> 00:18:23,429
- I do too!

725
00:18:23,429 --> 00:18:24,569
We've got all the candy food

726
00:18:24,569 --> 00:18:26,282
and we are so excited, because it's finally time

727
00:18:26,282 --> 00:18:28,338
to find out how they actually taste!

728
00:18:28,338 --> 00:18:30,069
We've got our candy pizzas here!

729
00:18:30,069 --> 00:18:31,160
- I'm ready! - Lord knows,

730
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,037
we added a lot of different stuff to this one, man.

731
00:18:33,037 --> 00:18:33,870
- [Devan] Yes we did.

732
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:35,356
- Mine is a frog on a log pizza,

733
00:18:35,356 --> 00:18:38,098
it's literally a log with a frog on top of it.

734
00:18:38,098 --> 00:18:39,554
- And mine's a pizza.

735
00:18:39,554 --> 00:18:40,869
- No creativity, man!

736
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:41,750
- Are you kidding me?

737
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:42,633
- Bland!

738
00:18:42,633 --> 00:18:45,068
Uninspired, lack of originality!

739
00:18:45,068 --> 00:18:46,727
Completely inadequate!

740
00:18:46,727 --> 00:18:50,317
Or, utter creativity and pure inspiration

741
00:18:50,317 --> 00:18:51,967
with a frog on a log?

742
00:18:51,967 --> 00:18:54,271
It's finally time to see how these things taste.

743
00:18:54,271 --> 00:18:55,331
- Yes! - So how about this,

744
00:18:55,331 --> 00:18:56,785
we go for mine first, you know?

745
00:18:56,785 --> 00:18:57,659
- Sure. - Really go for the

746
00:18:57,659 --> 00:18:59,114
the bang for the-- - The worst one.

747
00:18:59,114 --> 00:19:01,744
Yeah, go for the worst one first is what I'm hearin', right?

748
00:19:01,744 --> 00:19:02,577
- Bang for the buck.

749
00:19:02,577 --> 00:19:03,741
How about this, you grab a side of the frog,

750
00:19:03,741 --> 00:19:04,574
I'll grab a side of the frog,

751
00:19:04,574 --> 00:19:05,637
we'll just give him a little pull.

752
00:19:05,637 --> 00:19:06,687
There we go, oh my gosh!

753
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:07,757
This dude is stringy!

754
00:19:07,757 --> 00:19:10,018
I'm gonna pick up my half of the log.

755
00:19:10,018 --> 00:19:12,951
I'll give you your log, there we go, boom.

756
00:19:12,951 --> 00:19:14,710
- I don't know if I want all of this, man.

757
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:15,754
This is a lot of log. - Trust me, man.

758
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:17,521
You gotta bite into that log, dog.

759
00:19:17,521 --> 00:19:18,798
- Bite into the log, dog!

760
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:20,407
- It's frog on a log, bite into it dog.

761
00:19:20,407 --> 00:19:21,240
♪ Frog on a log ♪

762
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,073
♪ Frog on a log ♪

763
00:19:22,073 --> 00:19:22,906
♪ Frog on a log ♪

764
00:19:22,906 --> 00:19:23,739

765
00:19:23,739 --> 00:19:24,572
♪ Bite into the log, dog ♪

766
00:19:24,572 --> 00:19:25,905
Three, two, one!

767
00:19:28,486 --> 00:19:29,476
Mm!

768
00:19:29,476 --> 00:19:30,309
What?

769
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,005
- It's so salty!

770
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:33,838
- That log!

771
00:19:33,838 --> 00:19:34,870
- I don't know, man.

772
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:35,790
- Are you kidding me?

773
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:38,424
I am so disappointed man, like I loved every second of that!

774
00:19:38,424 --> 00:19:40,018
- Dude, you're spittin' everywhere!

775
00:19:40,018 --> 00:19:42,206
I'm like, I am showering in your spit.

776
00:19:42,206 --> 00:19:43,377
- I think that after we taste yours

777
00:19:43,377 --> 00:19:44,820
you're probably gonna go back and say

778
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,344
that mine was actually way better than you thought it was.

779
00:19:46,344 --> 00:19:47,348
- Not a chance, bro.

780
00:19:47,348 --> 00:19:48,739
- All right, well let's see how this thing tastes.

781
00:19:48,739 --> 00:19:50,058
- Now it is time for the main event!

782
00:19:50,058 --> 00:19:51,925
- Ah, you mean the back up secondary act?

783
00:19:51,925 --> 00:19:52,759
- No, no no no.

784
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:53,616
- It's not the main event.

785
00:19:53,616 --> 00:19:55,431
- All right, I'm gonna try to cut a quick slice here.

786
00:19:55,431 --> 00:19:57,087
- Okay, do the, whoa!

787
00:19:57,087 --> 00:19:58,678
That meld through it really easily.

788
00:19:58,678 --> 00:20:01,051
- Here we go, three, two, one!

789
00:20:01,051 --> 00:20:01,884
- Let's see.

790
00:20:01,884 --> 00:20:03,999
(yelling)

791
00:20:03,999 --> 00:20:05,345
Oh my gosh! - No way!

792
00:20:05,345 --> 00:20:07,810
- No way! - Look at that beauty-isness!

793
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:09,250
- Okay you know what, at this point

794
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,583
I think I should just forfeit.

795
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,165
Like, that was unbelievable!

796
00:20:12,165 --> 00:20:14,276
Can we just get like a beauty slow-mo shot of that?

797
00:20:14,276 --> 00:20:16,776
Oh, yeah, let's see, mm mm mm.

798
00:20:20,007 --> 00:20:21,005
- All right, you ready for this?

799
00:20:21,005 --> 00:20:21,838
Here we go.

800
00:20:21,838 --> 00:20:22,781
- Wait wait wait wait, whoa whoa whoa!

801
00:20:22,781 --> 00:20:23,983
- What? - What about my piece?

802
00:20:23,983 --> 00:20:25,990
- Oh, I almost forgot, I was so excited to eat this.

803
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:26,823
- Oh, look at that!

804
00:20:26,823 --> 00:20:30,249
Added benefit, double cheese pull, boom!

805
00:20:30,249 --> 00:20:31,749
- Three, two, one!

806
00:20:32,852 --> 00:20:35,047
(groaning)

807
00:20:35,047 --> 00:20:35,880
- Oh my gosh.

808
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,778
- Everything combines together so well.

809
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:40,501
- Holy cow bro, I'm like going through another dimension!

810
00:20:40,501 --> 00:20:41,937
I don't think I've ever said this before

811
00:20:41,937 --> 00:20:43,966
about a food, but that was life changing!

812
00:20:43,966 --> 00:20:46,883
This pizza just elevated pizza, man!

813
00:20:46,883 --> 00:20:47,725
It's that good.

814
00:20:47,725 --> 00:20:48,558
- Yeah!

815
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:50,047
- It is now time to eat our candy burgers,

816
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,471
and the first thing I wanna point out is the lettuce, bro!

817
00:20:52,471 --> 00:20:53,899
It's a presence in the room.

818
00:20:53,899 --> 00:20:55,443
Ultimately, it kinda feels like this, man.

819
00:20:55,443 --> 00:20:56,457
This is the expectation,

820
00:20:56,457 --> 00:20:57,520
like what you see in the commercial.

821
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,429
And this is reality. - Is reality.

822
00:20:59,429 --> 00:21:01,939
The hard truth of what a burger really looks like.

823
00:21:01,939 --> 00:21:03,599
- Exactly, but before we jump into your burger

824
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:04,538
and eat the french fries,

825
00:21:04,538 --> 00:21:06,056
I really wanna bust open that bottle of Coca-Cola.

826
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:06,939
- Ooh, I'm down!

827
00:21:06,939 --> 00:21:07,772
- Because, we are gonna

828
00:21:07,772 --> 00:21:08,763
be eating yours first, man. - Yes!

829
00:21:08,763 --> 00:21:09,596
- We gotta save this luscious lettuce for later.

830
00:21:09,596 --> 00:21:11,279
- So you just unscrew the top here,

831
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:13,996
you can see, save of the century, man.

832
00:21:13,996 --> 00:21:15,207
There ya' go. - There we go!

833
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:17,143
- See you got some Skittles on the inside here, so, oh.

834
00:21:17,143 --> 00:21:19,188
- Whoa whoa whoa, why don't we just break the whole bottle?

835
00:21:19,188 --> 00:21:20,425
- Oh, you do the honors!

836
00:21:20,425 --> 00:21:21,982
- Three, two, one!

837
00:21:21,982 --> 00:21:24,016
(screaming)

838
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:24,927
- Man, that was pretty wild lookin', okay!

839
00:21:24,927 --> 00:21:26,462
- I got mine.

840
00:21:26,462 --> 00:21:28,198
- Here we go, three, two, one!

841
00:21:28,198 --> 00:21:30,661
(crunching)

842
00:21:30,661 --> 00:21:33,234
- And that's definitely not as sharp as glass,

843
00:21:33,234 --> 00:21:34,718
but definitely not soft either.

844
00:21:34,718 --> 00:21:36,393
Okay, so next up let's try some french fries.

845
00:21:36,393 --> 00:21:37,226
- Let's do it. - Before we go

846
00:21:37,226 --> 00:21:38,334
into the burger.

847
00:21:38,334 --> 00:21:39,167
- I gotta say, - These are lookin' good.

848
00:21:39,167 --> 00:21:40,536
- Yeah, are they stretchy at all?

849
00:21:40,536 --> 00:21:41,369
- A little bit, yeah, they're a little.

850
00:21:41,369 --> 00:21:42,763
Did you just break a fry, bro?

851
00:21:42,763 --> 00:21:44,084
Did you just break a fry?

852
00:21:44,084 --> 00:21:44,987
- I did not. - Are you kidding?

853
00:21:44,987 --> 00:21:45,820
Here, take a new fry.

854
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,097
- Yep, I need a new fry, thank you.

855
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:48,150
We'll put that one back there, forget about that.

856
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:48,983
- Cheers!

857
00:21:48,983 --> 00:21:49,816
- All right,

858
00:21:49,816 --> 00:21:51,291
- Three, two, one.

859
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:52,124
- Pretty good.

860
00:21:52,124 --> 00:21:53,588
Now it's on to the burger.

861
00:21:53,588 --> 00:21:54,804
- All right, the main event here.

862
00:21:54,804 --> 00:21:55,702
All right, here we go.

863
00:21:55,702 --> 00:21:56,917
Are you gonna take a bite of it

864
00:21:56,917 --> 00:21:57,961
and then I take a bite of it, is that how we're doing this?

865
00:21:57,961 --> 00:21:59,774
- Oh, oh I forgot that you were gonna take a bite, sorry.

866
00:21:59,774 --> 00:22:00,991
I was just very excited to eat this thing.

867
00:22:00,991 --> 00:22:02,333
- How could you forget about me?

868
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:03,320
I'm your brother.

869
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,240
(sad music)

870
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,651
- [Devan] All right, so I'm just gonna cut it in half.

871
00:22:07,651 --> 00:22:09,674
- Ooh, that slices through nicely!

872
00:22:09,674 --> 00:22:11,174
- Three, two, one!

873
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:13,624
- Ta-da!

874
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:14,812
Oh, it's not so great.

875
00:22:14,812 --> 00:22:16,442
- Are we gonna be all right biting into this thing?

876
00:22:16,442 --> 00:22:17,287
- I hope so.

877
00:22:17,287 --> 00:22:18,787
- Three, two, one.

878
00:22:21,438 --> 00:22:22,453
- Bro! - What?

879
00:22:22,453 --> 00:22:23,472
- That bun!

880
00:22:23,472 --> 00:22:25,945
I put cinnamon on the top, holy cow!

881
00:22:25,945 --> 00:22:27,211
- It's like all bun.

882
00:22:27,211 --> 00:22:28,412
All right, well now it's time to move on

883
00:22:28,412 --> 00:22:30,303
to the unanimous winner!

884
00:22:30,303 --> 00:22:31,136
- What?

885
00:22:31,136 --> 00:22:32,925
- We haven't even eaten it yet and it's already won, man.

886
00:22:32,925 --> 00:22:33,847
- It's the curiosity.

887
00:22:33,847 --> 00:22:34,680
- It's a presence.

888
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,369
So here we go, we're just gonna go for the slice down.

889
00:22:36,369 --> 00:22:37,540
I don't think we need to try the french fries,

890
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,814
'cause they're Twizzlers.

891
00:22:38,814 --> 00:22:40,664
- Yeah, I'll try one, I'll do that.

892
00:22:40,664 --> 00:22:42,275
- Okay, fine. - Delicious.

893
00:22:42,275 --> 00:22:43,628
- All right great, so there we go my fries

894
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:44,571
are already better than his.

895
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:46,510
- Well, no, they're not unique at all.

896
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:47,343
- As you can tell,

897
00:22:47,343 --> 00:22:49,499
I don't need to compensate for uniqueness.

898
00:22:49,499 --> 00:22:50,409
My lettuce! - Lack of effort!

899
00:22:50,409 --> 00:22:53,181
Lack of effort, lack of effort.

900
00:22:53,181 --> 00:22:54,935
- Gonna slice down the top,

901
00:22:54,935 --> 00:22:56,458
this is gonna take all sorts of precision.

902
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,166
- Look at that Jell-O! - Ah there goes the tomatoes.

903
00:22:58,166 --> 00:22:59,861
All right, I think I've got it all the way through.

904
00:22:59,861 --> 00:23:00,864
Here we go, three,

905
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:03,581
- Two, one! - Separate that lettuce!

906
00:23:03,581 --> 00:23:05,030
- Oh! - Bam!

907
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,560
- How am I gonna eat this, bro?

908
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,393
- But I mean look at the inside!

909
00:23:07,393 --> 00:23:08,773
Look at those layers of flavor!

910
00:23:08,773 --> 00:23:10,460
- This might be the only time I eat a burger

911
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,774
with a fork and knife, man.

912
00:23:11,774 --> 00:23:13,473
- No no no no no no, smush it down.

913
00:23:13,473 --> 00:23:15,031
- All right sure, I think I can squish it.

914
00:23:15,031 --> 00:23:16,016
- All right, so here we go.

915
00:23:16,016 --> 00:23:18,618
We're gonna go for the bite of the ultimate lettuce burger.

916
00:23:18,618 --> 00:23:20,867
- This is not a first date burger, bro.

917
00:23:20,867 --> 00:23:22,548
- Definitely not a first date burger.

918
00:23:22,548 --> 00:23:24,048
- Three, two, one.

919
00:23:26,495 --> 00:23:27,882
- That's actually really good.

920
00:23:27,882 --> 00:23:28,715
- Whoa!

921
00:23:28,715 --> 00:23:30,366
(bouncy music)

922
00:23:30,366 --> 00:23:31,682
(cricket chirping)

923
00:23:31,682 --> 00:23:33,615
- On a scale of one to wow, how was it?

924
00:23:33,615 --> 00:23:34,448
- Wow!

925
00:23:34,448 --> 00:23:35,615
So you get to comment - I would say so!

926
00:23:35,615 --> 00:23:36,674
- Down below right now if you had to

927
00:23:36,674 --> 00:23:39,190
eat one of these burgers, which one would you want to eat?

928
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,023
This one! - Yeah!

929
00:23:40,023 --> 00:23:41,630
- And right now we're on to the next candy food.

930
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,522
We've got the eggs benedict, and it is finally time

931
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:45,292
to find out how sweet they taste.

932
00:23:45,292 --> 00:23:46,842
Because everybody loves breakfast!

933
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:47,735
- [Devan] Let's do yours first!

934
00:23:47,735 --> 00:23:48,568
- [Collins] Okay.

935
00:23:48,568 --> 00:23:49,964
- And let's start with what ever the heck that is

936
00:23:49,964 --> 00:23:50,920
on the top of yours, man.

937
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,753
- Excuse me?

938
00:23:51,753 --> 00:23:52,592
- I don't know what that is.

939
00:23:52,592 --> 00:23:53,729
- It's the avocado toast.

940
00:23:53,729 --> 00:23:54,562
- No, what?

941
00:23:54,562 --> 00:23:55,395
What is this?

942
00:23:55,395 --> 00:23:56,846
- Okay, so I don't fully remember.

943
00:23:56,846 --> 00:23:58,419
It was kind of a blur as I was making it.

944
00:23:58,419 --> 00:24:00,669
(shouting)

945
00:24:02,002 --> 00:24:03,033
It's like stuck to the plate.

946
00:24:03,033 --> 00:24:04,779
- Yeah I think it's all the sauce that we put on the top.

947
00:24:04,779 --> 00:24:06,354
- Oh, oh my gosh, you wanna?

948
00:24:06,354 --> 00:24:07,454
- I got the plate, I got the plate.

949
00:24:07,454 --> 00:24:09,054
- Whoa, got like a cheese pull.

950
00:24:09,054 --> 00:24:09,887
All right here we go,

951
00:24:09,887 --> 00:24:10,877
- Three, two, one.

952
00:24:10,877 --> 00:24:13,023
- Oh you put Jell-O in this, I forgot!

953
00:24:13,023 --> 00:24:13,856
Okay. - Hey, whoa whoa!

954
00:24:13,856 --> 00:24:14,689
- What?

955
00:24:14,689 --> 00:24:15,522
- You can't just like have me go

956
00:24:15,522 --> 00:24:16,489
and then I stop and then you go, okay?

957
00:24:16,489 --> 00:24:17,322
We got to do it together, synchronize.

958
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:18,155
- Ready, here we go.

959
00:24:18,155 --> 00:24:19,655
- Three, two, one.

960
00:24:20,947 --> 00:24:21,976
- Wow! - Whoa!

961
00:24:21,976 --> 00:24:23,409
- It's very light, very airy.

962
00:24:23,409 --> 00:24:24,283
That's a good job.

963
00:24:24,283 --> 00:24:25,965
- Don't swirl it around, it gets really bad.

964
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:28,107
(grumbling)

965
00:24:28,107 --> 00:24:29,423
- We have done a lot worse.

966
00:24:29,423 --> 00:24:30,607
- Oh, we have done a lot worse.

967
00:24:30,607 --> 00:24:31,464
All right, so-- - No no no,

968
00:24:31,464 --> 00:24:32,389
next it should be mine right?

969
00:24:32,389 --> 00:24:33,222
- Your bread next?

970
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:34,055
All right, and then we'll go ah.

971
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:35,272
- Compare the bread? - Yeah but I wanna eat that!

972
00:24:35,272 --> 00:24:36,105
Okay fine, we'll go for your bread next.

973
00:24:36,105 --> 00:24:37,328
- Yeah, let's do the bread next.

974
00:24:37,328 --> 00:24:39,339
I'm so ready for this man, I am so ready for this.

975
00:24:39,339 --> 00:24:40,404
- Whoa, I love it!

976
00:24:40,404 --> 00:24:41,798
- All right here we go, three!

977
00:24:41,798 --> 00:24:42,631
- Dropped a mallow.

978
00:24:42,631 --> 00:24:43,548
- Two, one!

979
00:24:44,956 --> 00:24:46,398
(grumbling)

980
00:24:46,398 --> 00:24:47,231
So good!

981
00:24:47,231 --> 00:24:48,229
(laughing)

982
00:24:48,229 --> 00:24:49,062
You kidding?

983
00:24:49,062 --> 00:24:50,701
- So the avocado toast, that goes to Devan.

984
00:24:50,701 --> 00:24:51,953
That was definitely better. - Thank you.

985
00:24:51,953 --> 00:24:54,362
- But, it comes down now to the actual main dish,

986
00:24:54,362 --> 00:24:55,847
the eggs benedict here, so.

987
00:24:55,847 --> 00:24:57,448
- Yeah, all right, well let's see how these work.

988
00:24:57,448 --> 00:24:58,281
- All right here we go,

989
00:24:58,281 --> 00:24:59,114
just gonna get a slice down like this.

990
00:24:59,114 --> 00:25:00,929
And remember man, there's a beautiful peep.

991
00:25:00,929 --> 00:25:02,010
It's not really comin'.

992
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:03,563
- [Devan] You're basically just moving the plate.

993
00:25:03,563 --> 00:25:04,449
- [Collins] It's the Peeps!

994
00:25:04,449 --> 00:25:05,936
The Peeps are the culprit man!

995
00:25:05,936 --> 00:25:06,769
- Peeps are resilient!

996
00:25:06,769 --> 00:25:07,949
Yeah, I'll have a whole one.

997
00:25:07,949 --> 00:25:08,782
- Yeah, take the whole one.

998
00:25:08,782 --> 00:25:09,615
- Yeah, I'll take the whole one.

999
00:25:09,615 --> 00:25:11,115
- Three, two, one!

1000
00:25:13,863 --> 00:25:15,656
- That's very dry. - Whoa.

1001
00:25:15,656 --> 00:25:17,870
- And kinda just like, meh, you know?

1002
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:18,803
- This is disappointing.

1003
00:25:18,803 --> 00:25:20,278
- Yeah, not a lot of flavors in this.

1004
00:25:20,278 --> 00:25:21,111
- Yeah, eh.

1005
00:25:21,111 --> 00:25:22,223
- All right, just gotta set this down.

1006
00:25:22,223 --> 00:25:23,588
- [Collins] Yeah, sorry.

1007
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:26,264
And so this is, just from what I hear you saying,

1008
00:25:26,264 --> 00:25:27,370
it's gonna ooze?

1009
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:28,544
- It's gonna ooze, bro!

1010
00:25:28,544 --> 00:25:29,526
I'm so excited for this, bro.

1011
00:25:29,526 --> 00:25:30,453
- I'm along for the ride.

1012
00:25:30,453 --> 00:25:31,761
- Three, two, one!

1013
00:25:31,761 --> 00:25:33,079
- [Collins] Let's see, just oh man!

1014
00:25:33,079 --> 00:25:34,795
It's all about your precision right now.

1015
00:25:34,795 --> 00:25:36,954
Can Devan, with his master knife skills,

1016
00:25:36,954 --> 00:25:38,029
actually cut into--

1017
00:25:38,029 --> 00:25:40,234
- Look at that ooze! - That's ooze!

1018
00:25:40,234 --> 00:25:42,436
You elbowed me in the chin man, ooze!

1019
00:25:42,436 --> 00:25:44,496
That is A plus quality ooze right there.

1020
00:25:44,496 --> 00:25:45,882
- [Devan] It really kinda looks like yolk.

1021
00:25:45,882 --> 00:25:46,792
- All right, here we go.

1022
00:25:46,792 --> 00:25:48,292
- Three, two, one!

1023
00:25:51,445 --> 00:25:52,612
- Oh, oh yeah!

1024
00:25:53,669 --> 00:25:55,557
(shouting)

1025
00:25:55,557 --> 00:25:56,836
- That is good, man!

1026
00:25:56,836 --> 00:25:57,669
- Wow. - Wow!

1027
00:25:57,669 --> 00:26:00,045
- It felt like fireworks going off, in my mouth.

1028
00:26:00,045 --> 00:26:02,012
That was incredible, so you kids comment down below!

1029
00:26:02,012 --> 00:26:04,725
Who's eggs benedict would you wanna eat, mine or Devan's?

1030
00:26:04,725 --> 00:26:05,558
If you wanna see another video

1031
00:26:05,558 --> 00:26:07,076
click right over here, you got five seconds, here we go!

1032
00:26:07,076 --> 00:26:10,076
- Five, four, three, two, one, done!

1033
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:11,964
- Love you, bye!
