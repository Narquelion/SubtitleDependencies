1
00:00:00,154 --> 00:00:01,151
- Yo!

2
00:00:01,151 --> 00:00:03,819
You challenged us to turn food into slime.

3
00:00:03,819 --> 00:00:05,164
Right now, let's go!

4
00:00:05,164 --> 00:00:06,227
- Whoa you can't eat that!

5
00:00:06,227 --> 00:00:07,907
(grimaces)

6
00:00:07,907 --> 00:00:08,988
- Oh my gosh.

7
00:00:08,988 --> 00:00:09,821
- Whoa bro, why?

8
00:00:09,821 --> 00:00:10,721
- For this round we'll be making a watermelon slime,

9
00:00:10,721 --> 00:00:11,756
so right now check this out.

10
00:00:11,756 --> 00:00:12,589
(blade slices)

11
00:00:12,589 --> 00:00:13,787
Bam just like that we cut it in half.

12
00:00:13,787 --> 00:00:14,963
So we took our ice cream scoopers

13
00:00:14,963 --> 00:00:16,166
because I don't think we have actual,

14
00:00:16,166 --> 00:00:16,999
like, watermelon scoopers.

15
00:00:16,999 --> 00:00:17,832
Let's see if we can just...

16
00:00:17,832 --> 00:00:18,665
Woo!

17
00:00:18,665 --> 00:00:19,857
So to kick it out I got some clear glue right here.

18
00:00:19,857 --> 00:00:22,356
I'm gonna add actual watermelon juice to mine.

19
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:23,372
- We're not eating it Collin,

20
00:00:23,372 --> 00:00:25,125
you don't have to go the extra step.

21
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:25,973
- [Collin] More watermelon!

22
00:00:25,973 --> 00:00:26,954
Boo, boo, boo!

23
00:00:26,954 --> 00:00:27,949
Those were the air horns.

24
00:00:27,949 --> 00:00:28,782
Ohh!

25
00:00:28,782 --> 00:00:29,777
The reason I'm going to win Devan

26
00:00:29,777 --> 00:00:32,057
is because my slime is now watermelon scented.

27
00:00:32,057 --> 00:00:33,702
So I'm going to add the contact solution in.

28
00:00:33,702 --> 00:00:34,535
Yo!

29
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:36,019
Okay, so we're getting into the club club phase now,

30
00:00:36,019 --> 00:00:36,945
and not

31
00:00:36,945 --> 00:00:39,388
quite looking sticky enough.

32
00:00:39,388 --> 00:00:40,461
- Oh, it's finally done.

33
00:00:40,461 --> 00:00:42,129
- And now mine has turned into a bowl of like,

34
00:00:42,129 --> 00:00:43,167
ramen noodles man.

35
00:00:43,167 --> 00:00:44,983
- [Devan] Those don't look like ramen noodles.

36
00:00:44,983 --> 00:00:46,168
- I, well, yeah.

37
00:00:46,168 --> 00:00:48,607
Did I not bring this back from the abyss or what?

38
00:00:48,607 --> 00:00:49,507
(sparkling chime)

39
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:51,493
Now that my slime is all rescued,

40
00:00:51,493 --> 00:00:52,326
boy!

41
00:00:52,326 --> 00:00:53,832
I didn't know if I would make it to this point,

42
00:00:53,832 --> 00:00:55,863
so now it's time for kind of the crazy X-Factor,

43
00:00:55,863 --> 00:00:56,696
and that is

44
00:00:56,696 --> 00:00:58,124
watermelon!

45
00:00:58,124 --> 00:00:58,957
- [Devan] What!

46
00:00:58,957 --> 00:00:59,790
- [Collin] Boom!

47
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:01,509
So now we're gonna mix all this watermelon into my slime.

48
00:01:01,509 --> 00:01:03,489
Bro, this feels so crazy.

49
00:01:03,489 --> 00:01:04,604
It's definitely not edible,

50
00:01:04,604 --> 00:01:06,382
but boy is it gonna smell good.

51
00:01:06,382 --> 00:01:08,354
Ohhhh, check it out!

52
00:01:08,354 --> 00:01:09,921
I think the watermelon might've, like, broken down

53
00:01:09,921 --> 00:01:12,107
my slime to where it's no longer able to be slimy,

54
00:01:12,107 --> 00:01:14,978
'cause now it's just kinda like thick glue at the moment.

55
00:01:14,978 --> 00:01:18,042
- Whoa, dude it looks so good!

56
00:01:18,042 --> 00:01:18,875
- Bro!

57
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:19,708
So now the final stage,

58
00:01:19,708 --> 00:01:20,753
we gotta fill up our watermelon bowls with slime.

59
00:01:20,753 --> 00:01:21,586
(watermelon hits container)

60
00:01:21,586 --> 00:01:22,676
So I'm gonna do the official like scoop-a-doop.

61
00:01:22,676 --> 00:01:23,701
Oooh!

62
00:01:23,701 --> 00:01:24,534
And then kinda put it in here,

63
00:01:24,534 --> 00:01:25,367
oh.

64
00:01:25,367 --> 00:01:26,200
Just plop it in the top there.

65
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,492
Tada!

66
00:01:27,492 --> 00:01:29,441
There you have a nice, juicy-- overflowing!

67
00:01:29,441 --> 00:01:30,461
Don't do that.

68
00:01:30,461 --> 00:01:31,294
Uh oh.

69
00:01:31,294 --> 00:01:32,241
- Dude mine looks awesome.

70
00:01:32,241 --> 00:01:33,314
- [Both] Yoooo!

71
00:01:33,314 --> 00:01:35,099
- [Collin] So those are the final watermelon slimes,

72
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:36,920
comment down below who you think won this round.

73
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,140
You challenged us to make a cupcake out of slime,

74
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,948
so right now we put our baking outfits on.

75
00:01:40,948 --> 00:01:41,781
- Baking outfits!

76
00:01:41,781 --> 00:01:42,614
Wait.

77
00:01:42,614 --> 00:01:43,447
(record scratches)

78
00:01:43,447 --> 00:01:44,280
Baking outfits?

79
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,113
- Baking outfits!

80
00:01:45,113 --> 00:01:45,946
Woo hoo!

81
00:01:45,946 --> 00:01:46,779
- Dude, you look so cute right now.

82
00:01:46,779 --> 00:01:48,501
Seriously, look at this apron bro.

83
00:01:48,501 --> 00:01:49,824
- Cute and adorable are not the words

84
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,149
I want to be described with.

85
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:51,982
Yeet.

86
00:01:51,982 --> 00:01:52,815
(choking)

87
00:01:52,815 --> 00:01:53,648
Yeet.

88
00:01:53,648 --> 00:01:54,481
Let's go!

89
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:55,314
That was way too excited.

90
00:01:55,314 --> 00:01:56,147
- Yeah, jeez.

91
00:01:56,147 --> 00:01:57,052
- So guys, basically for the cupcake slime

92
00:01:57,052 --> 00:01:57,885
it's super easy.

93
00:01:57,885 --> 00:01:58,718
- Dude, what did I just say?

94
00:01:58,718 --> 00:01:59,629
- All you got to do is just add some glue.

95
00:01:59,629 --> 00:02:00,462
Boop.

96
00:02:00,462 --> 00:02:01,582
And then you're just wanna grab some Sta-Flo

97
00:02:01,582 --> 00:02:02,722
pop that right in,

98
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:03,555
bam.

99
00:02:03,555 --> 00:02:04,388
Too much Sta-Flo.

100
00:02:04,388 --> 00:02:05,221
I think I need some more glue.

101
00:02:05,221 --> 00:02:06,753
Ugh, there we go.

102
00:02:06,753 --> 00:02:07,691
Drippity drip, you know?

103
00:02:07,691 --> 00:02:08,629
So basically there's gonna be

104
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:09,462
three components for this cupcake,

105
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:10,391
and as you guys can see, this is...

106
00:02:10,391 --> 00:02:12,571
Dude it's starting to get like all mucus-y again.

107
00:02:12,571 --> 00:02:14,891
This is what you call the high pour off the high dive.

108
00:02:14,891 --> 00:02:15,724
- The what?

109
00:02:15,724 --> 00:02:16,791
- [Collin] Oh nailed it.

110
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:18,042
- Where was the high dive though?

111
00:02:18,042 --> 00:02:18,963
- It's up there somewhere.

112
00:02:18,963 --> 00:02:19,796
- Oh, oh!

113
00:02:19,796 --> 00:02:20,629
I see it.

114
00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:21,506
- Whoa.

115
00:02:21,506 --> 00:02:23,127
Oh man, it's stuck to my hands.

116
00:02:23,127 --> 00:02:23,960
A slime,

117
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,793
ugh.

118
00:02:24,793 --> 00:02:26,062
- You're really good at making a mess dude.

119
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:27,228
- Devan, you know I have to go to my

120
00:02:27,228 --> 00:02:28,328
patented technique, you know,

121
00:02:28,328 --> 00:02:31,512
the double hand rollover to rollover double hand.

122
00:02:31,512 --> 00:02:32,987
- What?

123
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:35,140
Since when was that your patented technique?

124
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:35,973
- Yo!

125
00:02:35,973 --> 00:02:36,887
It's getting stretchy!

126
00:02:36,887 --> 00:02:38,139
Oh no, it's starting to split.

127
00:02:38,139 --> 00:02:39,211
My slime is not made yet.

128
00:02:39,211 --> 00:02:40,044
Oy.

129
00:02:40,044 --> 00:02:42,128
- Dude I did too much talking and now look at mine.

130
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:42,961
- That's wack!

131
00:02:42,961 --> 00:02:43,813
- [Devan] Karma.

132
00:02:43,813 --> 00:02:44,955
- It looks like a, a, a...

133
00:02:44,955 --> 00:02:45,788
Not good!

134
00:02:45,788 --> 00:02:46,621
- No, no, no, no, no.

135
00:02:46,621 --> 00:02:47,454
No.

136
00:02:47,454 --> 00:02:48,287
- I wanted to give you a hat though.

137
00:02:48,287 --> 00:02:49,120
- No.

138
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,953
- It would've been a fashion accessory.

139
00:02:49,953 --> 00:02:50,786
- That's already happened before and no.

140
00:02:50,786 --> 00:02:52,495
- This is like my most like slippery slime ever.

141
00:02:52,495 --> 00:02:53,328
It's almost like a yo--

142
00:02:53,328 --> 00:02:54,161
Oh!

143
00:02:54,161 --> 00:02:54,994
Gosh!

144
00:02:54,994 --> 00:02:55,827
Oh!

145
00:02:55,827 --> 00:02:56,660
- Oh!

146
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,493
- Sorry man, did not mean to do that.

147
00:02:57,493 --> 00:02:58,326
- Why?

148
00:02:58,326 --> 00:02:59,159
- Now it's time to add some coloring,

149
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:00,308
so we got some acrylic paint and now time to add it.

150
00:03:00,308 --> 00:03:02,767
- Yeah that's definitely how you add it guys.

151
00:03:02,767 --> 00:03:04,109
- Yo wait a minute bro!

152
00:03:04,109 --> 00:03:05,239
It's actually working!

153
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:06,072
Oh!

154
00:03:06,072 --> 00:03:06,905
Snap!

155
00:03:06,905 --> 00:03:07,738
Look at that color right there man,

156
00:03:07,738 --> 00:03:08,785
this is turning into batter.

157
00:03:08,785 --> 00:03:09,858
- Mine didn't work, look.

158
00:03:09,858 --> 00:03:10,885
Mine's still in a bottle.

159
00:03:10,885 --> 00:03:12,182
- Devan, you're not a sorcerer bro.

160
00:03:12,182 --> 00:03:13,033
- Look at this.

161
00:03:13,033 --> 00:03:14,088
Dude how did yours work?

162
00:03:14,088 --> 00:03:15,320
Well I guess I'm just going to have

163
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,466
to do it the normal way.

164
00:03:16,466 --> 00:03:17,299
- Going in,

165
00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:18,132
just gonna go, go, go!

166
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:18,965
Oh no!

167
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:19,798
I got the paint everywhere.

168
00:03:19,798 --> 00:03:20,809
- Bro what are you doing?

169
00:03:20,809 --> 00:03:22,254
- This smells terrible dude.

170
00:03:22,254 --> 00:03:23,087
- Dude.

171
00:03:23,087 --> 00:03:24,213
- And my hands are all pasty.

172
00:03:24,213 --> 00:03:25,152
Looks like my hands haven't been in the sun

173
00:03:25,152 --> 00:03:26,122
for a couple hundred years.

174
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:27,199
- This looks like when you first

175
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:29,314
put on sunscreen and you don't mix it in.

176
00:03:29,314 --> 00:03:30,333
- Dude, the more you stretch it out,

177
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:31,667
the more it looks like batter bro.

178
00:03:31,667 --> 00:03:32,500
- [Devan] Boom.

179
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,333
- We've now got our.

180
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:34,166
Oops!

181
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:34,999
- Nooo!

182
00:03:34,999 --> 00:03:36,164
- Oh no, I actually got real cupcake on mine!

183
00:03:36,164 --> 00:03:36,997
- [Devan] No!

184
00:03:36,997 --> 00:03:38,307
- So here we go, we've got our cupcake base,

185
00:03:38,307 --> 00:03:39,506
and now we're just gonna put a certain amount

186
00:03:39,506 --> 00:03:41,314
of this batter slime in.

187
00:03:41,314 --> 00:03:42,532
Yo this is actually pretty cool right here.

188
00:03:42,532 --> 00:03:43,365
- [Devan] Yeah.

189
00:03:43,365 --> 00:03:44,198
Trick shot!

190
00:03:44,198 --> 00:03:45,031
Oh!

191
00:03:45,031 --> 00:03:46,823
- Prime number one is done for the base of the cupcake,

192
00:03:46,823 --> 00:03:48,163
and now it's time--

193
00:03:48,163 --> 00:03:49,451
(slime hits Collin)

194
00:03:49,451 --> 00:03:50,505
for slime number two.

195
00:03:50,505 --> 00:03:51,419
For this next slime,

196
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:54,009
just fill up the cupcake container thingy with some glue.

197
00:03:54,009 --> 00:03:54,842
- [Devan] Okay.

198
00:03:54,842 --> 00:03:56,215
That's actually working quite well.

199
00:03:56,215 --> 00:03:57,275
- Measurement number two,

200
00:03:57,275 --> 00:03:58,235
gotta add 1/4 teaspoon,

201
00:03:58,235 --> 00:03:59,068
ow,

202
00:03:59,068 --> 00:04:00,255
of baking soda.

203
00:04:00,255 --> 00:04:01,168
- Dude why do you do that every time?

204
00:04:01,168 --> 00:04:02,001
- Yeah.

205
00:04:02,001 --> 00:04:03,452
- That's not a lot at all.

206
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:05,242
Next up is a tablespoon of lotion.

207
00:04:05,242 --> 00:04:06,683
- [Collin] This is a very slow dispense.

208
00:04:06,683 --> 00:04:07,516
- [Devan] Slow process.

209
00:04:07,516 --> 00:04:08,366
- So I counted that,

210
00:04:08,366 --> 00:04:09,237
it was approximately...

211
00:04:09,237 --> 00:04:10,856
12 squirts of lotion.

212
00:04:10,856 --> 00:04:12,213
And finally, contact solution.

213
00:04:12,213 --> 00:04:13,246
I don't want to get my hands dirty,

214
00:04:13,246 --> 00:04:15,365
I've got my little sticks.

215
00:04:15,365 --> 00:04:16,811
I had my lil' sticks.

216
00:04:16,811 --> 00:04:17,644
Agh!

217
00:04:17,644 --> 00:04:18,477
Boom, nailed it.

218
00:04:18,477 --> 00:04:19,310
- Eeeh.

219
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,143
- Ugh.

220
00:04:20,143 --> 00:04:21,437
Oh!

221
00:04:21,437 --> 00:04:22,270
Holy cow.

222
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,103
- Wow.

223
00:04:23,103 --> 00:04:23,936
- It got all over me.

224
00:04:23,936 --> 00:04:24,769
Wow.

225
00:04:24,769 --> 00:04:25,602
Well my slime on a stick is looking mighty fine,

226
00:04:25,602 --> 00:04:27,190
so I think it's time for the next ingredient

227
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,023
which is, Devan, guess.

228
00:04:28,023 --> 00:04:28,856
- Clay.

229
00:04:28,856 --> 00:04:29,689
- No.

230
00:04:29,689 --> 00:04:30,522
- Bummer, what is it?

231
00:04:30,522 --> 00:04:31,355
- Clay.

232
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:32,188
- It is?

233
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,021
- You guessed right.

234
00:04:33,021 --> 00:04:33,854
- Yay!

235
00:04:33,854 --> 00:04:34,687
- Here we go,

236
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,520
we got the clay.

237
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,353
Oh man this clay feels nice.

238
00:04:36,353 --> 00:04:37,186
So here's what we gotta do now.

239
00:04:37,186 --> 00:04:38,019
Use my stick,

240
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:38,852
oh I broke my stick again.

241
00:04:38,852 --> 00:04:39,685
Ohh.

242
00:04:39,685 --> 00:04:40,518
Dude, you hear those pops?

243
00:04:40,518 --> 00:04:41,835
- Whoa, yours is looking awesome bro.

244
00:04:41,835 --> 00:04:42,668
- Yeah man.

245
00:04:42,668 --> 00:04:43,501
- Oh!

246
00:04:43,501 --> 00:04:44,334
- It's a really good slime.

247
00:04:44,334 --> 00:04:45,451
Like it doesn't crack or anything,

248
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:46,284
look at this.

249
00:04:46,284 --> 00:04:47,117
(cracks)

250
00:04:47,117 --> 00:04:47,950
The final step,

251
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:48,783
time to add some pink acrylic paint to it.

252
00:04:48,783 --> 00:04:49,616
- Mm yes.

253
00:04:49,616 --> 00:04:50,449
- So again, technique goes,

254
00:04:50,449 --> 00:04:51,282
pop the bottle in the middle.

255
00:04:51,282 --> 00:04:52,197
Oh it's starting to work again!

256
00:04:52,197 --> 00:04:53,030
Look at this,

257
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:53,863
there's like a giant bubble of it right here, Devan,

258
00:04:53,863 --> 00:04:54,951
I'm about to split the bubble of paint.

259
00:04:54,951 --> 00:04:55,784
Are you ready?

260
00:04:55,784 --> 00:04:56,617
Ohhh.

261
00:04:56,617 --> 00:04:57,855
Dude it's about to like bust open right now,

262
00:04:57,855 --> 00:04:59,267
and then it's all gonna be all pink.

263
00:04:59,267 --> 00:05:01,134
- It looks like a pink cloud bro.

264
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:01,967
- Agh!

265
00:05:01,967 --> 00:05:02,800
Yo!

266
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,621
Yo my butter slime is like falling apart.

267
00:05:04,621 --> 00:05:05,454
There we go.

268
00:05:05,454 --> 00:05:06,287
Nice.

269
00:05:06,287 --> 00:05:07,120
Saucy.

270
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,757
The frosting is now made,

271
00:05:08,757 --> 00:05:09,732
it's time for the final part,

272
00:05:09,732 --> 00:05:11,957
which is the sprinkles!

273
00:05:11,957 --> 00:05:13,577
We've got a whole bunch of little clay packets.

274
00:05:13,577 --> 00:05:14,608
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

275
00:05:14,608 --> 00:05:15,667
What is up with this clay?

276
00:05:15,667 --> 00:05:16,566
It's like taffy.

277
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,646
This is so crazy.

278
00:05:17,646 --> 00:05:18,479
- Whoa.

279
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:19,696
- So it's going to start on the otter rim.

280
00:05:19,696 --> 00:05:20,529
Woo.

281
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:21,487
Keep going in.

282
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:22,660
- Oops and then here.

283
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,321
Okay I'm finishing mine off with a massive blueberry.

284
00:05:24,321 --> 00:05:25,678
Bam.

285
00:05:25,678 --> 00:05:26,511
It's on top of my cupcake.

286
00:05:26,511 --> 00:05:27,626
Boom, we've locked them in,

287
00:05:27,626 --> 00:05:28,729
so right now Devan here it is,

288
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:29,562
the big reveal.

289
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:30,502
That looks so good.

290
00:05:30,502 --> 00:05:32,491
- [Both] Three, two, one.

291
00:05:32,491 --> 00:05:34,339
Wait, wait, wait, first five second subscribe challenge.

292
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:36,719
We want to see if you can subscribe to this channel

293
00:05:36,719 --> 00:05:37,604
and turn on the channel post notifications

294
00:05:37,604 --> 00:05:39,199
in five seconds.

295
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,032
Are you ready?

296
00:05:40,032 --> 00:05:40,865
Here we go.

297
00:05:40,865 --> 00:05:43,198
Five, four, three, two, one.

298
00:05:45,154 --> 00:05:45,987
Done.

299
00:05:45,987 --> 00:05:47,052
If you can do that comment down below

300
00:05:47,052 --> 00:05:48,140
Keyper squad right now.

301
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:48,973
- [Both] Tada!

302
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:50,572
- [Collin] So I think that I won this round

303
00:05:50,572 --> 00:05:51,517
with my massive blueberry,

304
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:52,350
but I mean,

305
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,183
ohhh!

306
00:05:53,183 --> 00:05:54,798
Now we get to mix the slimes together.

307
00:05:54,798 --> 00:05:56,163
Oh dude, look at this, my blueberry.

308
00:05:56,163 --> 00:05:57,556
You can see that blueberry like coming through.

309
00:05:57,556 --> 00:05:58,389
- [Devan] Oh!

310
00:05:58,389 --> 00:05:59,222
- We've got the real cupcake here.

311
00:05:59,222 --> 00:06:01,469
You gotta take the cupcake and treat it like slime.

312
00:06:01,469 --> 00:06:02,302
- Wait.

313
00:06:02,302 --> 00:06:03,135
- Ohhh.

314
00:06:03,135 --> 00:06:04,667
This is now officially a slime cupcake.

315
00:06:04,667 --> 00:06:06,598
So you guys get to comment down below who won this round

316
00:06:06,598 --> 00:06:08,407
and right now we are on to the next one.

317
00:06:08,407 --> 00:06:09,778
- Man that looks mad funky.

318
00:06:09,778 --> 00:06:11,483
- Next up we're making one of our favorite foods.

319
00:06:11,483 --> 00:06:12,316
- Yeah.

320
00:06:12,316 --> 00:06:13,149
- Sushi.

321
00:06:13,149 --> 00:06:13,982
- Oh yeah.

322
00:06:13,982 --> 00:06:14,815
- So we've got some beads right here for the rice.

323
00:06:14,815 --> 00:06:15,648
Oopsie.

324
00:06:15,648 --> 00:06:16,481
So I'm gonna dump all these in first.

325
00:06:16,481 --> 00:06:17,314
Yo!

326
00:06:17,314 --> 00:06:18,147
Alright now time for the big beads.

327
00:06:18,147 --> 00:06:18,980
Oh.

328
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,443
- I'm actually going to use a chopstick to mix this around.

329
00:06:20,443 --> 00:06:21,276
Oh, yeah.

330
00:06:21,276 --> 00:06:22,177
This is looking good.

331
00:06:22,177 --> 00:06:23,364
- Here we go, time to add some glue now.

332
00:06:23,364 --> 00:06:24,197
- [Both] Ugh.

333
00:06:24,197 --> 00:06:25,372
- There we go.

334
00:06:25,372 --> 00:06:26,681
- You know when you haven't like

335
00:06:26,681 --> 00:06:28,282
walked in sand in a long time and it kind of like

336
00:06:28,282 --> 00:06:29,633
really, really tickles your toes?

337
00:06:29,633 --> 00:06:30,600
It's tickling my hands.

338
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,708
- Oh, this feels weird.

339
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:33,235
Oh my gosh, this is one of the weirdest

340
00:06:33,235 --> 00:06:34,859
things I've ever felt.

341
00:06:34,859 --> 00:06:35,753
Ooooh.

342
00:06:35,753 --> 00:06:38,140
Whenever we make slime it always just turns into noises,

343
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:38,973
we're like ooooh.

344
00:06:38,973 --> 00:06:39,806
Ughhhh.

345
00:06:39,806 --> 00:06:40,639
- Whoa!

346
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,472
- Alright I think I might need a little bit more

347
00:06:41,472 --> 00:06:42,902
Sta-Flo but my rice is like almost there.

348
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:43,735
- Man, look at mine.

349
00:06:43,735 --> 00:06:44,568
It's pretty much perfect.

350
00:06:44,568 --> 00:06:45,401
- [Man] Whoa.

351
00:06:45,401 --> 00:06:46,234
- [Collin] You have like the perfect ratio

352
00:06:46,234 --> 00:06:48,289
of slime to beads to Sta-Flo.

353
00:06:48,289 --> 00:06:49,122
- Oh yeah.

354
00:06:49,122 --> 00:06:49,955
- Oh!

355
00:06:49,955 --> 00:06:50,818
Yo, I just had a great idea.

356
00:06:50,818 --> 00:06:51,651
- What's that?

357
00:06:51,651 --> 00:06:53,660
- I'm gonna make like one huge piece of sushi.

358
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,971
They always say that rice is the heart of sushi,

359
00:06:55,971 --> 00:06:57,301
so I'm going to make mine look like

360
00:06:57,301 --> 00:06:58,134
a heart.

361
00:06:58,134 --> 00:06:59,663
- That does not look like a heart.

362
00:06:59,663 --> 00:07:00,788
- [Collin] It's got a little dippy thing.

363
00:07:00,788 --> 00:07:01,945
- It doesn't look like a heart at all.

364
00:07:01,945 --> 00:07:03,065
- And we'll fold over the bottom like this,

365
00:07:03,065 --> 00:07:03,898
it's a towel.

366
00:07:03,898 --> 00:07:05,566
- Oh, okay.

367
00:07:05,566 --> 00:07:06,496
- Yoo hoo!

368
00:07:06,496 --> 00:07:07,329
- Ow.

369
00:07:07,329 --> 00:07:08,183
This is gonna be my salmon.

370
00:07:08,183 --> 00:07:09,016
- Alright.

371
00:07:09,016 --> 00:07:10,287
Oop, whoa.

372
00:07:10,287 --> 00:07:12,882
- So I got it now and now I'm gonna shape it like a salmon.

373
00:07:12,882 --> 00:07:13,715
- So here it is,

374
00:07:13,715 --> 00:07:14,722
my first strip of fish.

375
00:07:14,722 --> 00:07:15,555
- Ohh, nice.

376
00:07:15,555 --> 00:07:16,388
- Lovely.

377
00:07:16,388 --> 00:07:17,269
This one here Devan, you know what this is?

378
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:18,102
- What?

379
00:07:18,102 --> 00:07:18,935
- My yellow tail.

380
00:07:18,935 --> 00:07:19,768
- Oh!

381
00:07:19,768 --> 00:07:20,601
- I'm not really feeling how my

382
00:07:20,601 --> 00:07:21,434
sushi's coming out right now,

383
00:07:21,434 --> 00:07:22,267
so I got to add some real pieces of sushi.

384
00:07:22,267 --> 00:07:23,100
So we've got piece number one.

385
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:23,933
- [Devan] Oh.

386
00:07:23,933 --> 00:07:24,766
- Piece number two.

387
00:07:24,766 --> 00:07:25,599
And then of course you've always got

388
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:26,432
to add a little bit of ginger to your sushi

389
00:07:26,432 --> 00:07:27,735
because that's a pallette cleanser.

390
00:07:27,735 --> 00:07:28,568
Fun fact.

391
00:07:28,568 --> 00:07:29,766
And then of course, some wasabi,

392
00:07:29,766 --> 00:07:31,923
just smear it across the bottom like that.

393
00:07:31,923 --> 00:07:32,756
There we go.

394
00:07:32,756 --> 00:07:33,589
If I didn't know better,

395
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:35,510
I would literally say that is sushi right there,

396
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,537
and I might accidentally eat it,

397
00:07:36,537 --> 00:07:37,370
so right now,

398
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:38,203
here's the big reveal.

399
00:07:38,203 --> 00:07:39,036
You ready?

400
00:07:39,036 --> 00:07:39,869
- [Both] Three, two, one!

401
00:07:39,869 --> 00:07:40,702
Tada!

402
00:07:40,702 --> 00:07:41,535
- Look at that!

403
00:07:41,535 --> 00:07:42,368
So good!

404
00:07:42,368 --> 00:07:43,201
- That looks so good!

405
00:07:43,201 --> 00:07:44,034
- Dude, I would eat that.

406
00:07:44,034 --> 00:07:44,867
And I can't,

407
00:07:44,867 --> 00:07:45,700
'cause it's slime.

408
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,533
- [Collin] That looks insane.

409
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:48,320
The thing is mine is a sushi roll,

410
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,981
which means what is it missing Devan?

411
00:07:49,981 --> 00:07:50,986
- Uh, the roll.

412
00:07:50,986 --> 00:07:51,966
- The roll!

413
00:07:51,966 --> 00:07:52,872
So check it out here we go.

414
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:53,705
Gonna roll it up.

415
00:07:53,705 --> 00:07:54,961
- [Devan] Oh I didn't actually think

416
00:07:54,961 --> 00:07:55,794
you were going to do it.

417
00:07:55,794 --> 00:07:56,627
You're actually doing it.

418
00:07:56,627 --> 00:07:57,556
- Now we're going to fold over one side like this,

419
00:07:57,556 --> 00:07:58,881
and now I guess it's time to mix it altogether.

420
00:07:58,881 --> 00:08:00,687
Ohhh, look you can like see all the little sushis in there.

421
00:08:00,687 --> 00:08:01,670
Oh, snap!

422
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:03,400
Dude the wasabi is like coming all out of it.

423
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,555
- Why would you do this?

424
00:08:04,555 --> 00:08:05,388
- What?

425
00:08:05,388 --> 00:08:06,221
Where'd all the yellow come from?

426
00:08:06,221 --> 00:08:07,733
- Remember you had a yellow tail in there?

427
00:08:07,733 --> 00:08:08,939
- Oh right, right, right.

428
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:10,649
So you get to comment down below, who won this round,

429
00:08:10,649 --> 00:08:12,568
and right now we are on to the next one.

430
00:08:12,568 --> 00:08:15,088
This one, we're making ice cream,

431
00:08:15,088 --> 00:08:16,691
so right now we're gonna kick it off with a small batch.

432
00:08:16,691 --> 00:08:17,524
So I'm only.

433
00:08:17,524 --> 00:08:18,648
Oop, no, no, no, I'm only trying to do a little bit.

434
00:08:18,648 --> 00:08:19,481
Done.

435
00:08:19,481 --> 00:08:20,582
Now time to add the Sta-Flo in.

436
00:08:20,582 --> 00:08:21,721
That should be enough.

437
00:08:21,721 --> 00:08:23,859
We're got a cone, oh an ice cream sandwich,

438
00:08:23,859 --> 00:08:24,872
or we could make a sundae.

439
00:08:24,872 --> 00:08:26,291
Yeehoo!

440
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:29,233
- Somehow the top of this Sta-Flo thing ended up in mine.

441
00:08:29,233 --> 00:08:30,066
- It was me.

442
00:08:30,066 --> 00:08:31,044
I have a glove.

443
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:32,095
Time to add my clay in.

444
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,288
Ohh!

445
00:08:33,288 --> 00:08:34,538
(glass shattering)

446
00:08:34,538 --> 00:08:36,480
Man my hands are getting cramped.

447
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,313
Oh!

448
00:08:37,313 --> 00:08:38,973
I wonder if I could like, use my forearms to do my slime.

449
00:08:38,973 --> 00:08:39,806
Ugh.

450
00:08:39,806 --> 00:08:42,355
That sounds like my slime is ready to go.

451
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,578
- Woo, woo, woo, bam!

452
00:08:43,578 --> 00:08:45,126
- Now I have my slime all broken out,

453
00:08:45,126 --> 00:08:46,425
and it's time to add some coloring.

454
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:48,665
Oh no, no, no, I'm getting it all over the table.

455
00:08:48,665 --> 00:08:50,076
Oh no, my hands are going to be so green.

456
00:08:50,076 --> 00:08:51,515
- Alright I'm going to add some blue to mine

457
00:08:51,515 --> 00:08:52,348
to see what happens.

458
00:08:52,348 --> 00:08:53,181
Ugh!

459
00:08:53,181 --> 00:08:54,189
- Dude your hands are going to be so blue!

460
00:08:54,189 --> 00:08:55,220
- Nooo!

461
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,090
- You look like a Smurf!

462
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:56,979
- What have I done?

463
00:08:56,979 --> 00:08:58,507
- I'm doing this successfully I think.

464
00:08:58,507 --> 00:08:59,519
- [Devan] Whoa, it looks really cool.

465
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,002
- [Both] Whoaaa.

466
00:09:01,002 --> 00:09:02,005
- Alright mine is done,

467
00:09:02,005 --> 00:09:03,846
and it gets the thumbs up approval.

468
00:09:03,846 --> 00:09:06,051
- Dude it looks like gray, just saying.

469
00:09:06,051 --> 00:09:07,113
Now for the final part,

470
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:08,088
time to actually make the ice cream.

471
00:09:08,088 --> 00:09:10,850
- Fist, I am doing strawberry added in,

472
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,497
and second I'm doing some purple.

473
00:09:12,497 --> 00:09:13,556
- You can't take mine!

474
00:09:13,556 --> 00:09:14,389
No!

475
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:15,479
- [Devan] Look at that.

476
00:09:15,479 --> 00:09:16,886
- Here we go, I'm going to have some

477
00:09:16,886 --> 00:09:17,719
mint on this side over here,

478
00:09:17,719 --> 00:09:18,552
we've got the orange,

479
00:09:18,552 --> 00:09:19,962
the yellow for the lemon flavor.

480
00:09:19,962 --> 00:09:20,795
- Whoa.

481
00:09:20,795 --> 00:09:21,628
Looking good.

482
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:22,461
- Bam, and then done.

483
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:24,259
There's my ice cream sundae.

484
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:27,023
- There's my ice cream sandwich,

485
00:09:27,023 --> 00:09:28,827
and then here's my ice cream sundae.

486
00:09:28,827 --> 00:09:31,240
- Ice cream sundae, looking more like an ice cream Monday!

487
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,073
Oooh!

488
00:09:32,073 --> 00:09:33,593
- Now for some whipped cream!

489
00:09:33,593 --> 00:09:34,903
- No, that's not fair!

490
00:09:34,903 --> 00:09:35,939
- Oh!

491
00:09:35,939 --> 00:09:36,772
Yes!

492
00:09:36,772 --> 00:09:37,820
- That looks so bad.

493
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,653
Alright well whatever.

494
00:09:38,653 --> 00:09:39,486
- [Devan] Just ignore that.

495
00:09:39,486 --> 00:09:40,568
- Comment down below who won this round.

496
00:09:40,568 --> 00:09:43,185
Now time to take all the colors and mix them altogether!

497
00:09:43,185 --> 00:09:44,152
Yeah, woo!

498
00:09:44,152 --> 00:09:45,362
Three, two, one, stretch it!

499
00:09:45,362 --> 00:09:46,930
- [Both] Whoaaa!

500
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:48,583
- We're making the sweetest slime ever,

501
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:49,427
this is honey slime.

502
00:09:49,427 --> 00:09:50,715
So right now, let's go.

503
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:51,685
This one's pretty easy.

504
00:09:51,685 --> 00:09:52,809
Basically you just have clear glue,

505
00:09:52,809 --> 00:09:55,185
and then going to add some clear contact solution,

506
00:09:55,185 --> 00:09:56,060
just gonna pop the top off.

507
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,201
- Is there any other kind--

508
00:09:57,201 --> 00:09:58,034
Oh.

509
00:09:58,034 --> 00:09:59,323
- I wasted a little bit, which is not good,

510
00:09:59,323 --> 00:10:01,221
because I need as much as I can possibly get.

511
00:10:01,221 --> 00:10:02,054
- Oh!

512
00:10:02,054 --> 00:10:02,887
- There you go!

513
00:10:02,887 --> 00:10:03,720
Nice!

514
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,553
Now we have these little like honey stirrer things

515
00:10:04,553 --> 00:10:05,912
that are really cute that we can use to mix it around.

516
00:10:05,912 --> 00:10:06,952
So there we go.

517
00:10:06,952 --> 00:10:07,785
- Look at that!

518
00:10:07,785 --> 00:10:08,725
- [Collin] This is so awesome!

519
00:10:08,725 --> 00:10:10,289
- Alright it's time to get the hands in there.

520
00:10:10,289 --> 00:10:11,122
Oh.

521
00:10:11,122 --> 00:10:12,982
Dude I did not add enough contact solution man.

522
00:10:12,982 --> 00:10:15,253
- You might need to use some Sta-Flo.

523
00:10:15,253 --> 00:10:18,015
- Yep, mine's definitely a little bit milky now.

524
00:10:18,015 --> 00:10:18,848
- Hmm.

525
00:10:18,848 --> 00:10:20,549
Boomin' now, I am one with the bees.

526
00:10:20,549 --> 00:10:21,686
- Wait what?

527
00:10:21,686 --> 00:10:23,004
- I am now a bee, Devan.

528
00:10:23,004 --> 00:10:23,837
- Okay.

529
00:10:23,837 --> 00:10:24,670
- Buzz.

530
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:25,503
- Okay, alright.

531
00:10:25,503 --> 00:10:26,336
There's the sound.

532
00:10:26,336 --> 00:10:27,169
- Buzz.

533
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:28,002
- Okay, alright.

534
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,287
- Just a couple drops of bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop.

535
00:10:29,287 --> 00:10:31,083
I mean, buzzzzz.

536
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:32,644
- [Both] Yo!

537
00:10:32,644 --> 00:10:33,767
- [Devan] That looks so good!

538
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:34,916
- [Collin] This looks just like golden honey!

539
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,120
- Bro, nicely done.

540
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,011
- Thank you, it's because I'm one with the bees.

541
00:10:38,011 --> 00:10:38,936
- I guess, yeah.

542
00:10:38,936 --> 00:10:40,849
- Wait, I know like putting the bee hat on

543
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:41,997
would maybe like attract some bees,

544
00:10:41,997 --> 00:10:42,830
but like.

545
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:44,624
- [Both] Whoa!

546
00:10:44,624 --> 00:10:48,316
- This looks just like honey, oh my gosh!

547
00:10:48,316 --> 00:10:49,979
- Alright time to add my food coloring.

548
00:10:49,979 --> 00:10:50,812
- Guys go away.

549
00:10:50,812 --> 00:10:51,761
- Alright, there we go.

550
00:10:51,761 --> 00:10:52,660
That's good for right now.

551
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,493
- Buzz off.

552
00:10:53,493 --> 00:10:54,326
- Dude, they're your friends.

553
00:10:54,326 --> 00:10:56,364
- Dude, but they're like freaking me out a little bit.

554
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:57,337
- But Steve was sayin' hello.

555
00:10:57,337 --> 00:10:58,170
- [Steve The Bee] Hi.

556
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:00,299
- Yeah, well Steve, goodbye!

557
00:11:00,299 --> 00:11:01,132
Uh buzz!

558
00:11:01,132 --> 00:11:03,579
- Dude, this looks so much like honey,

559
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,181
this looks so cool!

560
00:11:05,181 --> 00:11:06,255
- Even though it's super simple,

561
00:11:06,255 --> 00:11:08,020
this is one of my favorite slimes we've ever made.

562
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,676
Especially with this little stick thing here,

563
00:11:09,676 --> 00:11:11,051
I mean I don't know what, is this like a honey comb stick,

564
00:11:11,051 --> 00:11:11,974
it looks super cute.

565
00:11:11,974 --> 00:11:12,807
Buzz!

566
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:16,049
I was just buzzing 'cause my thingy went like floppin'.

567
00:11:16,049 --> 00:11:17,700
- [Devan] Alright, mine is ready to add to the jar.

568
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,880
- Alright so we just gotta open up our jars,

569
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,713
woohoo!

570
00:11:19,713 --> 00:11:20,546
- Oop.

571
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:21,707
- This is gonna look so cool,

572
00:11:21,707 --> 00:11:22,827
just gonna pour my honey in.

573
00:11:22,827 --> 00:11:23,994
Ohhhh, no way.

574
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,330
That looks so good!

575
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:29,012
- That looks so delicious!

576
00:11:29,012 --> 00:11:31,145
- [Collin] It literally looks like honey, too!

577
00:11:31,145 --> 00:11:33,815
- Oh my goodness, that looks so good.

578
00:11:33,815 --> 00:11:35,578
- There we go, my honey is done.

579
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:38,074
Oh my gosh, it's like right to the top!

580
00:11:38,074 --> 00:11:39,329
I love it!

581
00:11:39,329 --> 00:11:40,461
I'm so happy!

582
00:11:40,461 --> 00:11:41,791
It's so beautiful!

583
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:42,687
Oh my gosh!

584
00:11:42,687 --> 00:11:44,375
I made something pretty for once.

585
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,016
- [Devan] Even the drizzle on

586
00:11:46,016 --> 00:11:47,488
the actual table looks really good.

587
00:11:47,488 --> 00:11:48,321
I know.

588
00:11:48,321 --> 00:11:50,056
- Alright now it's time to add mine to the jar.

589
00:11:50,056 --> 00:11:51,148
- How's it gonna fit in there?

590
00:11:51,148 --> 00:11:53,933
- [Devan] Just like this Collin, just like this.

591
00:11:53,933 --> 00:11:54,766
- [Collin] That was actually really smart.

592
00:11:54,766 --> 00:11:55,599
- [Devan] Uh huh.

593
00:11:55,599 --> 00:11:56,663
That's looking cool man.

594
00:11:56,663 --> 00:11:57,496
- [Collin] Oh!

595
00:11:57,496 --> 00:11:58,509
- [Devan] That looks so good.

596
00:11:58,509 --> 00:11:59,367
- So guys this is it.

597
00:11:59,367 --> 00:12:00,861
- Oh, look at that!

598
00:12:00,861 --> 00:12:03,634
- This is what the honey slime looks like, oh my gosh.

599
00:12:03,634 --> 00:12:04,791
So guys, comment down below.

600
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:05,798
Who made a better one?

601
00:12:05,798 --> 00:12:07,268
This one's actually going to be a

602
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:08,908
legitimately tough competition,

603
00:12:08,908 --> 00:12:11,643
but right now let's buzz into the next round.

604
00:12:11,643 --> 00:12:12,476
- Alright.

605
00:12:12,476 --> 00:12:13,309
- This round we're making an edible

606
00:12:13,309 --> 00:12:15,115
peanut butter and jelly sandwich,

607
00:12:15,115 --> 00:12:16,812
but it's going to be made out of slime,

608
00:12:16,812 --> 00:12:18,733
so right now, let's make some edible slime.

609
00:12:18,733 --> 00:12:19,566
Woohoo!

610
00:12:19,566 --> 00:12:20,714
- Whoa, bro.

611
00:12:20,714 --> 00:12:21,547
That was my lunch.

612
00:12:21,547 --> 00:12:22,380
- I'm sorry.

613
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,213
I'm making the jelly.

614
00:12:23,213 --> 00:12:24,066
- And I'm making the peanut butter.

615
00:12:24,066 --> 00:12:25,262
- You okay?

616
00:12:25,262 --> 00:12:27,072
I need six tablespoons of jelly.

617
00:12:27,072 --> 00:12:28,498
- And I'm just gonna do, I don't know,

618
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:29,364
maybe like six of these?

619
00:12:29,364 --> 00:12:30,433
I'm just gonna eyeball it, you know?

620
00:12:30,433 --> 00:12:31,266
- Two.

621
00:12:31,266 --> 00:12:32,111
Man I forgot how much I love jelly.

622
00:12:32,111 --> 00:12:33,283
Jelly's amazing.

623
00:12:33,283 --> 00:12:35,859
And now I just need nine tablespoons of corn starch.

624
00:12:35,859 --> 00:12:37,986
- And now I gotta add this light corn syrup.

625
00:12:37,986 --> 00:12:39,473
So this acts like the glue,

626
00:12:39,473 --> 00:12:41,810
and this acts like the liquid starch.

627
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:42,837
That's my revelation.

628
00:12:42,837 --> 00:12:43,953
So now I'm going to mix it around.

629
00:12:43,953 --> 00:12:44,942
- I'm just going in with my hands,

630
00:12:44,942 --> 00:12:45,775
so here we go guys.

631
00:12:45,775 --> 00:12:46,608
Ohhh.

632
00:12:46,608 --> 00:12:50,014
- Alright next up, I have to add one teaspoon of cornstarch.

633
00:12:50,014 --> 00:12:51,577
- Alright well I guess that now we just

634
00:12:51,577 --> 00:12:52,412
have to hope that this works,

635
00:12:52,412 --> 00:12:53,789
story of my life.

636
00:12:53,789 --> 00:12:54,622
- Yes!

637
00:12:54,622 --> 00:12:55,455
- Dude!

638
00:12:55,455 --> 00:12:56,697
That's like actually turning into slime!

639
00:12:56,697 --> 00:12:57,540
- I know right!

640
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,264
It's kind of some chunky, funky peanut butter.

641
00:13:00,264 --> 00:13:02,070
- Well hey, you know people like chunky peanut butter.

642
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:04,479
See the issue is that, it's just kind of coating my hands.

643
00:13:04,479 --> 00:13:06,002
Like it's just like all over my fingers.

644
00:13:06,002 --> 00:13:07,275
Could you please give me a little bit

645
00:13:07,275 --> 00:13:08,512
more cornstarch into my palms.

646
00:13:08,512 --> 00:13:09,539
- Is that enough>?

647
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:10,372
- No.

648
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:11,517
- You could just dab it in there bro.

649
00:13:11,517 --> 00:13:13,823
- This didn't quite go according to plan.

650
00:13:13,823 --> 00:13:14,863
It's just goop.

651
00:13:14,863 --> 00:13:15,696
Alright, so here we go.

652
00:13:15,696 --> 00:13:17,206
I'm gonna try to smear this

653
00:13:17,206 --> 00:13:18,993
off of my hands onto that.

654
00:13:18,993 --> 00:13:20,260
- You know, I'm gonna go like this,

655
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,872
turn it into a nice little patty,

656
00:13:21,872 --> 00:13:23,021
- Alright well here we go, you know,

657
00:13:23,021 --> 00:13:24,960
I'm going to try to spread my jelly on the top here,

658
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,793
that's not working.

659
00:13:25,793 --> 00:13:26,939
- Usually, peanut butter is the one

660
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:27,901
that has trouble spreading.

661
00:13:27,901 --> 00:13:29,073
But now it's jelly.

662
00:13:29,073 --> 00:13:30,445
- [Both] Ohhhh.

663
00:13:30,445 --> 00:13:31,508
- I feel the chunks.

664
00:13:31,508 --> 00:13:32,341
Great.

665
00:13:32,341 --> 00:13:34,932
It actually kind of looks like it's some sort of ice cream.

666
00:13:34,932 --> 00:13:36,540
I just realized this has been all over your hands,

667
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,694
I don't know if I want to eat this.

668
00:13:37,694 --> 00:13:38,715
- Don't worry, I washed my hands.

669
00:13:38,715 --> 00:13:39,548
- [Devan] There we go.

670
00:13:39,548 --> 00:13:40,381
- [Collin] Boom.

671
00:13:40,381 --> 00:13:41,214
- Dude, I can feel the peanut butter

672
00:13:41,214 --> 00:13:42,452
being really, really solid.

673
00:13:42,452 --> 00:13:44,388
It's like cardboard's in the middle of my sandwich.

674
00:13:44,388 --> 00:13:46,091
- Yo dude, you should try it and see how it tastes!

675
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:47,127
- I'm so ready bro!

676
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:48,636
- [Both] Three, two, one.

677
00:13:48,636 --> 00:13:49,982
- But first, three second like challenge.

678
00:13:49,982 --> 00:13:52,899
We want to see if you can like this video in three seconds.

679
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:55,653

680
00:13:55,653 --> 00:13:56,486
- Alright here we go.

681
00:13:56,486 --> 00:13:58,002
Three, two, one.

682
00:13:58,002 --> 00:14:00,098
(biting sound)

683
00:14:00,098 --> 00:14:01,144
Ohhh.

684
00:14:01,144 --> 00:14:01,977
- Is it good?

685
00:14:01,977 --> 00:14:03,237
- It actually is 'cause the peanut butter

686
00:14:03,237 --> 00:14:04,484
is actually really, really hard,

687
00:14:04,484 --> 00:14:06,808
and the jelly's kinda like, you know, slimy.

688
00:14:06,808 --> 00:14:07,641
Whoa.

689
00:14:07,641 --> 00:14:08,474
Whoa.

690
00:14:08,474 --> 00:14:09,307
It tastes delicious though.
