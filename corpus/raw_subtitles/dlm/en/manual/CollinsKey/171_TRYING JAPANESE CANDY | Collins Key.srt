1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,138
- That's what they look like.

2
00:00:01,138 --> 00:00:03,361
- Oh, they feel so weird. - I know.

3
00:00:03,361 --> 00:00:04,225
- Like jiggles.

4
00:00:04,225 --> 00:00:05,169
(both gasp disgustedly)

5
00:00:05,169 --> 00:00:06,204
What's up, it's Collins Key

6
00:00:06,204 --> 00:00:07,862
and welcome to the Thursday vlog.

7
00:00:07,862 --> 00:00:09,941
Now in moment, Devan is gonna be joining me

8
00:00:09,941 --> 00:00:12,473
but he can't right now because I sent Devan on a mission.

9
00:00:12,473 --> 00:00:15,456
I sent Devan all the way to Japan for one reason

10
00:00:15,456 --> 00:00:18,456
and that reason is to get Japanese candy for us to test.

11
00:00:18,456 --> 00:00:20,808
So right now, everyone please, all the way from Japan,

12
00:00:20,808 --> 00:00:21,844
I'm about to make him teleport,

13
00:00:21,844 --> 00:00:23,701
my little brother, Devan Key.

14
00:00:23,701 --> 00:00:25,118
- [Both] Hey!

15
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:26,061
- Welcome home, bro!

16
00:00:26,061 --> 00:00:27,143
- I missed you.

17
00:00:27,143 --> 00:00:27,976
- I missed you too.

18
00:00:27,976 --> 00:00:28,919
My arm just kinda went crazy there.

19
00:00:28,919 --> 00:00:29,752
- I know right.

20
00:00:29,752 --> 00:00:30,601
- All right, cool, well Devan,

21
00:00:30,601 --> 00:00:31,883
do you have the candy with you?

22
00:00:31,883 --> 00:00:33,401
- I have all of this candy.

23
00:00:33,401 --> 00:00:35,130
- Well he wasn't out there for the only reason to get candy.

24
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,278
- Yeah, no. - He was actually out there

25
00:00:36,278 --> 00:00:39,073
for a trip, but he actually got candy while he was out there

26
00:00:39,073 --> 00:00:40,935
and I have no idea what he got.

27
00:00:40,935 --> 00:00:42,935
So in a minute, we're gonna be tasting this stuff,

28
00:00:42,935 --> 00:00:44,540
reacting to it, it's...

29
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:45,498
Yeah, I have no idea.

30
00:00:45,498 --> 00:00:46,419
You said you got some pretty weird stuff.

31
00:00:46,419 --> 00:00:47,575
- I got some pretty weird stuff.

32
00:00:47,575 --> 00:00:48,408
I'm pretty excited (laughs).

33
00:00:48,408 --> 00:00:49,845
- And also, yeah, if you guys are excited

34
00:00:49,845 --> 00:00:52,187

35
00:00:52,187 --> 00:00:54,979

36
00:00:54,979 --> 00:00:56,594

37
00:00:56,594 --> 00:00:58,713
that we've ever done before on this channel?

38
00:00:58,713 --> 00:01:00,390
I wanted to let you guys know that for Father's Day,

39
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,273
Devan and I have partnered with Best Fiends

40
00:01:02,273 --> 00:01:03,904

41
00:01:03,904 --> 00:01:06,211
and if you guys play it on Sunday June 19th,

42
00:01:06,211 --> 00:01:08,405
which is Father's Day, you will get a free gift.

43
00:01:08,405 --> 00:01:10,989
So Devan, what do they have to know?

44
00:01:10,989 --> 00:01:12,177
(laughs) Bro, you had one job.

45
00:01:12,177 --> 00:01:13,322
Okay, let's try this again (laughs).

46
00:01:13,322 --> 00:01:14,805
Devan, what do they have to do?

47
00:01:14,805 --> 00:01:15,673
- No, I can't talk right now.

48
00:01:15,673 --> 00:01:16,506
I just got to level nine.

49
00:01:16,506 --> 00:01:17,406
- Bro! - Come on.

50
00:01:17,406 --> 00:01:18,781
Oh, like right now?

51
00:01:18,781 --> 00:01:19,647
- Yes, right now.

52
00:01:19,647 --> 00:01:21,971
- Oh, okay. - Okay, yeah yeah yeah please.

53
00:01:21,971 --> 00:01:24,227
- The download link is in the description below,

54
00:01:24,227 --> 00:01:25,405
so make sure you go download it.

55
00:01:25,405 --> 00:01:26,800
It's free, so might as well

56
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,451
and I'm just gonna take my phone back.

57
00:01:28,451 --> 00:01:29,742
- Nope, I'm taking this back.

58
00:01:29,742 --> 00:01:30,632
- For real? - Yes.

59
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:32,660
Introduce the video, go for it.

60
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,081
How do you want to start the video?

61
00:01:34,081 --> 00:01:36,864
- Okay, let's jump into trying out these Japanese candies.

62
00:01:36,864 --> 00:01:40,147
- How are we gonna jump into it, bro?

63
00:01:40,147 --> 00:01:40,980
(yells)

64
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:43,733
- Okay, now that I have all of my tourist gear off,

65
00:01:43,733 --> 00:01:45,698
let's jump in to the first candy.

66
00:01:45,698 --> 00:01:46,878
Bam! - (laughs) What?

67
00:01:46,878 --> 00:01:47,861
- That's what it is, right!

68
00:01:47,861 --> 00:01:48,923
- It looks like a turd.

69
00:01:48,923 --> 00:01:50,104
Let's do it. - (laughs) I am

70
00:01:50,104 --> 00:01:53,185
super interested to find out what this tastes like.

71
00:01:53,185 --> 00:01:55,462
- What if it literally is just a turd, but in Japan

72
00:01:55,462 --> 00:01:58,437
it's like a delicacy? - I don't think it can be.

73
00:01:58,437 --> 00:01:59,822
(groans disgustedly)

74
00:01:59,822 --> 00:02:00,655
- It kinda smells. - Tastes like...

75
00:02:00,655 --> 00:02:01,488
All right, ready?

76
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:03,282
- Yup, hold up.

77
00:02:03,282 --> 00:02:04,365
- Whoa! Whoa!

78
00:02:05,686 --> 00:02:07,867
(hums satisfyingly)

79
00:02:07,867 --> 00:02:09,034
What the heck?

80
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:14,208
- Mm.

81
00:02:17,315 --> 00:02:18,341
- Whoa, okay.

82
00:02:18,341 --> 00:02:20,741
(laughs)

83
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:21,824
Chubby bunny.

84
00:02:24,063 --> 00:02:25,403
- Chubby bunny.

85
00:02:25,403 --> 00:02:26,653
- Chubby bunny.

86
00:02:30,429 --> 00:02:31,679
- Chubby bunny.

87
00:02:32,565 --> 00:02:33,815
- Chubby bunny.

88
00:02:35,626 --> 00:02:36,464
(screams)

89
00:02:36,464 --> 00:02:37,993
- All right, so the first one, Devan good job.

90
00:02:37,993 --> 00:02:39,468
It was like Styrofoam on the inside.

91
00:02:39,468 --> 00:02:40,779
- I know. - But like tasty Styrofoam.

92
00:02:40,779 --> 00:02:41,772
- I had no idea what that was gonna be

93
00:02:41,772 --> 00:02:43,079
and it was surprisingly good.

94
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:45,752
- Yes, A plus for the turd candy (laughs).

95
00:02:45,752 --> 00:02:46,958
All right cool, let's try the next one.

96
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:47,791
- All right, let's do it.

97
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:50,905
Bam, bam, hu-bam! (robotic sound effects)

98
00:02:50,905 --> 00:02:52,189
(laughs)

99
00:02:52,189 --> 00:02:53,338
- I'm not gonna edit that at all.

100
00:02:53,338 --> 00:02:55,820
It's just gonna look like just how you just did it.

101
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,426
- That's like these two little cats.

102
00:02:57,426 --> 00:02:58,259
- Are they edible?

103
00:02:58,259 --> 00:02:59,092
- Yeah.

104
00:02:59,092 --> 00:02:59,925
- Oh my gosh.

105
00:02:59,925 --> 00:03:00,758
- And they have little bells on them,

106
00:03:00,758 --> 00:03:02,896
so I don't know if that's edible or not, but...

107
00:03:02,896 --> 00:03:03,735
- We'll eat them, I don't care.

108
00:03:03,735 --> 00:03:05,545
- What? A metal bell?

109
00:03:05,545 --> 00:03:06,666
- I mean, nevermind, that's weird.

110
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:07,499
- What's all this stuff?

111
00:03:07,499 --> 00:03:08,354
- Instructions?

112
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:09,187
- I don't know, maybe.

113
00:03:09,187 --> 00:03:10,152
- Do not eat.

114
00:03:10,152 --> 00:03:13,015
I'm gonna go for the hand first.

115
00:03:13,015 --> 00:03:14,086
Mm.

116
00:03:14,086 --> 00:03:15,038
(hums curiously)

117
00:03:15,038 --> 00:03:15,910
It's like just straight sugar.

118
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,090
- No, that's too sugary.

119
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,302
- Another sugar overload.

120
00:03:18,302 --> 00:03:20,008
- You're gonna eat the whole thing (chuckles)?

121
00:03:20,008 --> 00:03:21,055
(hums agreeably)

122
00:03:21,055 --> 00:03:21,888
Why?

123
00:03:21,888 --> 00:03:24,475
I feel like you could just eat one ear a day.

124
00:03:24,475 --> 00:03:25,404
- It's good though.

125
00:03:25,404 --> 00:03:26,371
- It's pretty good.

126
00:03:26,371 --> 00:03:27,458
Mine's a little bald.

127
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:28,528
(both laugh)

128
00:03:28,528 --> 00:03:29,411
Time for the next one.

129
00:03:29,411 --> 00:03:30,712
- Yeah, that was just straight sugar.

130
00:03:30,712 --> 00:03:33,044
- Next one, is this little sushi thing.

131
00:03:33,044 --> 00:03:33,877
- Aw.

132
00:03:33,877 --> 00:03:34,801
- I know right? - So cute.

133
00:03:34,801 --> 00:03:36,817
It looks super plastic though.

134
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:37,650
- It does.

135
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,483
- Do you only have one of them?

136
00:03:38,483 --> 00:03:39,316
- I only have one.

137
00:03:39,316 --> 00:03:40,149
Go for it.

138
00:03:40,149 --> 00:03:42,685
- Little bit of sushi.

139
00:03:42,685 --> 00:03:46,580
- (laughs) Is that a candy?

140
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:49,061
- This is just a plastic sushi thing (laughs loudly).

141
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:49,897
Look at this!

142
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:50,750
It's got like a little...

143
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,270
It's like a little plastic thing you put together.

144
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,510
- I can't believe I did that. - That's going in the trash.

145
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,402
My tooth hurts a little bit too from that.

146
00:03:57,402 --> 00:03:58,679
I was biting really hard.

147
00:03:58,679 --> 00:04:00,153
- I can't believe I did that.

148
00:04:00,153 --> 00:04:01,069
- I know.

149
00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:03,394
- All right, so next, we have these little,

150
00:04:03,394 --> 00:04:07,455
circular things that almost looks like Tex-Mex.

151
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:08,755
(grunts)

152
00:04:08,755 --> 00:04:09,997
- Let's get an instant replay on that.

153
00:04:09,997 --> 00:04:10,830
(grunts)

154
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,194
Are you sure this is a candy?

155
00:04:12,194 --> 00:04:13,828
- I bought it at a candy store.

156
00:04:13,828 --> 00:04:15,527
They taste like the Tex-Mex stuff.

157
00:04:15,527 --> 00:04:17,117
- After the amount of sugar I just had,

158
00:04:17,117 --> 00:04:18,325
this does not taste good.

159
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:19,207
Can I spit it out now?

160
00:04:19,207 --> 00:04:20,750
- Go for it. - Okay.

161
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,418
- Okay, this one is a hit or miss.

162
00:04:23,418 --> 00:04:24,711
That's what they look like.

163
00:04:24,711 --> 00:04:25,857
I have no idea (chuckles)

164
00:04:25,857 --> 00:04:27,818
if these are gonna taste good or not,

165
00:04:27,818 --> 00:04:29,064
so let's find out.

166
00:04:29,064 --> 00:04:32,280
- Oh, they feel so weird. - I know.

167
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,321
- Oh.

168
00:04:33,321 --> 00:04:34,154
- Yo!

169
00:04:34,992 --> 00:04:36,069
(both gasp disgustingly)

170
00:04:36,069 --> 00:04:37,256
- It like jiggles.

171
00:04:37,256 --> 00:04:39,158
- Oh it does feel weirder than I expected.

172
00:04:39,158 --> 00:04:40,629
- Oh it feels super weird.

173
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:41,462
Cheers. - Cheers.

174
00:04:41,462 --> 00:04:42,420
- This better be a bug or something, bro.

175
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,253
- Oh, I hope it's not.

176
00:04:54,924 --> 00:04:55,757
- Oh man.

177
00:04:56,816 --> 00:04:58,439
I don't like it at all.

178
00:04:58,439 --> 00:04:59,272
- Uh uh.

179
00:04:59,272 --> 00:05:01,247
- That was not good.

180
00:05:01,247 --> 00:05:02,326
- That was terrible.

181
00:05:02,326 --> 00:05:03,374
- It was like everything was--

182
00:05:03,374 --> 00:05:04,918
(gags)

183
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:06,923
Sorry, got a chunk stuck in my throat.

184
00:05:06,923 --> 00:05:08,360
It's hard when you bite it,

185
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,672
but on this inside there's some...

186
00:05:09,672 --> 00:05:10,725
What is this?

187
00:05:10,725 --> 00:05:11,678
(yells disgustedly)

188
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,479
That was a major loss.

189
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,033
- That was really gross.

190
00:05:15,033 --> 00:05:15,866
- Okay, let's do another one.

191
00:05:15,866 --> 00:05:16,699
- All right, let's do it.

192
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:17,532
(both yell)

193
00:05:17,532 --> 00:05:20,167
These I got for a very special reason,

194
00:05:20,167 --> 00:05:21,749
because they look like little pillows.

195
00:05:21,749 --> 00:05:22,909
- Hey! - They're so cute.

196
00:05:22,909 --> 00:05:23,747
- They're so cute.

197
00:05:23,747 --> 00:05:25,661
- I want to kinda just sleep on these,

198
00:05:25,661 --> 00:05:26,956
but I couldn't, so...

199
00:05:26,956 --> 00:05:29,548
I'm assuming it's gonna taste like mints

200
00:05:29,548 --> 00:05:30,823
and I'm hoping it tastes like mints.

201
00:05:30,823 --> 00:05:31,989
- Give it, these actually look...

202
00:05:31,989 --> 00:05:33,494
I'm so excited for these. - These look really good.

203
00:05:33,494 --> 00:05:35,677
- I'm so excited. - They're like...

204
00:05:35,677 --> 00:05:36,679
- Mm.

205
00:05:36,679 --> 00:05:38,206
- Is it good?

206
00:05:38,206 --> 00:05:39,039
That's pretty good.

207
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,367
- Can't bite into it.

208
00:05:41,367 --> 00:05:42,739
- Ow (laughs).

209
00:05:42,739 --> 00:05:44,717
- (laughs) That was Devan's tooth you just heard break.

210
00:05:44,717 --> 00:05:45,550
- They taste pretty good.

211
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,611
(hums agreeably)

212
00:05:46,611 --> 00:05:49,284
- They're not a perfect 10.

213
00:05:49,284 --> 00:05:51,592
They're on the six and a half to seven range.

214
00:05:51,592 --> 00:05:52,837
- But they're not super sugary,

215
00:05:52,837 --> 00:05:54,339
so they're kind of an acquired taste,

216
00:05:54,339 --> 00:05:55,172
which is good.

217
00:05:55,172 --> 00:05:58,062
All right, jumping on into the next one.

218
00:05:58,062 --> 00:05:58,895
- (laughs) What was that?

219
00:05:58,895 --> 00:05:59,728
- It's kind of a mystery box.

220
00:05:59,728 --> 00:06:00,561
- Yeah.

221
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:02,546
- I actually don't even know what's inside of it.

222
00:06:02,546 --> 00:06:05,510
So we're going to find this out together.

223
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,343
Yay. - Yay.

224
00:06:06,343 --> 00:06:07,296
- Yay. - Yay.

225
00:06:07,296 --> 00:06:08,784
(grumble disgusted)

226
00:06:08,784 --> 00:06:09,689
Oh my gosh.

227
00:06:09,689 --> 00:06:11,243
- They're little faces. - You're right!

228
00:06:11,243 --> 00:06:13,253
I'm gonna take a little photo and insert it right over here,

229
00:06:13,253 --> 00:06:14,588
so you guys can see what we're talking about.

230
00:06:14,588 --> 00:06:15,578
That's from my SnapChat by the way.

231
00:06:15,578 --> 00:06:16,790
All right, here we go, cheers.

232
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:17,969
- Time to eat it.

233
00:06:17,969 --> 00:06:19,434
Oh wait, no no no.

234
00:06:19,434 --> 00:06:20,394
- Make them kiss, make them kiss?

235
00:06:20,394 --> 00:06:21,479
- Yeah, make them kiss.

236
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:22,312
(sighs adoringly)

237
00:06:22,312 --> 00:06:24,709
- Aw, so cute, okay, eat them.

238
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:25,542
- Oh!

239
00:06:25,542 --> 00:06:26,513
- Oh, there's something inside!

240
00:06:26,513 --> 00:06:28,412
There's something inside of it!

241
00:06:28,412 --> 00:06:29,554
- No!

242
00:06:29,554 --> 00:06:32,110
- I'm gonna power through this other half.

243
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,110
- What? Why?

244
00:06:34,047 --> 00:06:36,297
- Note to self, do not eat another person's face.

245
00:06:36,297 --> 00:06:37,130
That was gross.

246
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,579
I am not a fan. - (groans) I need to rinse

247
00:06:38,579 --> 00:06:40,273
out my mouth.

248
00:06:40,273 --> 00:06:42,020
- All right, I'll be right back too.

249
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,179
- (gasps) Was it bad.

250
00:06:43,179 --> 00:06:45,259
These ones are actually kinda promising.

251
00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:46,092
- Okay.

252
00:06:46,092 --> 00:06:47,484
- So, yeah.

253
00:06:47,484 --> 00:06:48,747
- Oh, the little cute--

254
00:06:48,747 --> 00:06:51,083
- I know right? - Balls (laughs).

255
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:51,979
- I guess so.

256
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:52,812
- Okay.

257
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:54,200
- So these are almost like,

258
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,683
what are those Halloween candies that--

259
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:57,974
- Balls. - No no (laughs).

260
00:06:57,974 --> 00:06:58,807
- Whoppers?

261
00:06:58,807 --> 00:07:00,331
- Whoppers, these are like Whoppers.

262
00:07:00,331 --> 00:07:01,888
- Okay.

263
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:04,361
It tastes like cereal that's been sitting soggy

264
00:07:04,361 --> 00:07:06,056
in a bowl for like 20 minutes.

265
00:07:06,056 --> 00:07:07,357
- There's like some chocolate in the middle.

266
00:07:07,357 --> 00:07:09,343
It's like a reverse Whopper.

267
00:07:09,343 --> 00:07:10,773
- I like these, they're very good.

268
00:07:10,773 --> 00:07:11,606
- They're really good.

269
00:07:11,606 --> 00:07:12,655
- Two thumbs up.

270
00:07:12,655 --> 00:07:13,972
- (laughs) Two thumbs up.

271
00:07:13,972 --> 00:07:18,139
Next up, we got the little brother to the big turds.

272
00:07:19,954 --> 00:07:21,963
They really do, they look like little ones.

273
00:07:21,963 --> 00:07:24,184
- They smell exactly the same as the big turds,

274
00:07:24,184 --> 00:07:25,354
just smaller.

275
00:07:25,354 --> 00:07:26,869
- Yeah, I'm not excited for this.

276
00:07:26,869 --> 00:07:30,786
- I'm not either, let's take a turd and try it.

277
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:34,349
Nope, they're a little bit different.

278
00:07:34,349 --> 00:07:36,497
Their insides are crunchier, but I don't like it.

279
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,497
- Oh, no! No, no, uh uh.

280
00:07:40,859 --> 00:07:42,233
I need to wash my mouth again.

281
00:07:42,233 --> 00:07:43,423
- Yeah these are worse. - Terrible.

282
00:07:43,423 --> 00:07:45,818
- I need a cloud pillow to help out my taste buds.

283
00:07:45,818 --> 00:07:46,651
- Yeah, a cloud pillow. - Take a cloud pillow.

284
00:07:46,651 --> 00:07:48,068
- A cloud pillow.

285
00:07:49,016 --> 00:07:50,427
Ow!

286
00:07:50,427 --> 00:07:51,260
- Did you bite it?

287
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,093
- I did.

288
00:07:52,093 --> 00:07:52,940
- You're an idiot, bro!

289
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,581
(laughs) Why would you do that?

290
00:07:54,581 --> 00:07:55,496
Is this the last one?

291
00:07:55,496 --> 00:07:56,591
- This is the last one.

292
00:07:56,591 --> 00:07:57,721
- I hope you saved the best for last.

293
00:07:57,721 --> 00:07:58,573
- I did actually.

294
00:07:58,573 --> 00:08:00,463
This one I have actually tried.

295
00:08:00,463 --> 00:08:03,331
I literally bought this, ate the whole package,

296
00:08:03,331 --> 00:08:06,139
and then went back the next day so I could have it

297
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:06,972
for the flight. - No way!

298
00:08:06,972 --> 00:08:08,409
Okay, yo!

299
00:08:08,409 --> 00:08:10,386
You had these, I was so jealous.

300
00:08:10,386 --> 00:08:11,602
(hums satisfyingly)

301
00:08:11,602 --> 00:08:13,237
- They're so good.

302
00:08:13,237 --> 00:08:16,415
- Oh my gosh. - Right, right?

303
00:08:16,415 --> 00:08:17,471
Really good.

304
00:08:17,471 --> 00:08:18,974
- Oh my gosh.

305
00:08:18,974 --> 00:08:20,151
It's like gum that you chew,

306
00:08:20,151 --> 00:08:23,274
but it slowly dissolves but it has so much more flavor.

307
00:08:23,274 --> 00:08:25,306
Wow! - I tried all the flavors.

308
00:08:25,306 --> 00:08:27,983
- Wow, that was a good one.

309
00:08:27,983 --> 00:08:28,937
- That's a good one to end on.

310
00:08:28,937 --> 00:08:32,148
- That was a (hums satisfyingly)--

311
00:08:32,148 --> 00:08:34,118
(laughs) Is that how you do it, I don't know.

312
00:08:34,118 --> 00:08:36,735
Dab, all right (laughs) if you guys enjoyed this video,

313
00:08:36,735 --> 00:08:38,223
let's us know by giving a big--

314
00:08:38,223 --> 00:08:39,131
- [Both] Thumbs up.

315
00:08:39,131 --> 00:08:41,029
- Comment down below, what's another place in the world

316
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:42,701
we should try candy from and also

317
00:08:42,701 --> 00:08:44,354
where you live. - And maybe I'll travel there.

318
00:08:44,354 --> 00:08:45,418
- Yeah maybe Dev will travel there

319
00:08:45,418 --> 00:08:47,524
specifically to pick up candy. - Just to pick up candy.

320
00:08:47,524 --> 00:08:48,456
- Again, if you haven't already,

321
00:08:48,456 --> 00:08:49,601
make sure you subscribe to this channel.

322
00:08:49,601 --> 00:08:51,225
Love you all so much, bye!

323
00:08:51,225 --> 00:08:52,058
(snaps)
