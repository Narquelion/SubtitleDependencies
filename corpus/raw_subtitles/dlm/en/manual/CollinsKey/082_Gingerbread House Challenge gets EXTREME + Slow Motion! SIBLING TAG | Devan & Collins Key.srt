1
00:00:00,075 --> 00:00:04,184
- Three, two one! (hammer banging)

2
00:00:04,184 --> 00:00:06,071
(laughing)

3
00:00:06,071 --> 00:00:07,338
What's up, it's Collins Key,

4
00:00:07,338 --> 00:00:08,944
and welcome to the Thursday blog.

5
00:00:08,944 --> 00:00:10,458
Now for today's video, I've got an insane

6
00:00:10,458 --> 00:00:12,763
holiday-themed challenge for you guys.

7
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:14,665
We're going all out, we're going extreme

8
00:00:14,665 --> 00:00:16,595
just like these ridiculous blow-up things

9
00:00:16,595 --> 00:00:17,988
we got in the background.

10
00:00:17,988 --> 00:00:20,123
But I do need someone very special to help me out,

11
00:00:20,123 --> 00:00:22,300
so everyone please welcome back to one of my videos,

12
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,339
my little brother Devin Key. Ayy!

13
00:00:25,339 --> 00:00:26,412
Don't fall on the dinosaur!

14
00:00:26,412 --> 00:00:27,395
- Oh no!

15
00:00:27,395 --> 00:00:29,656
- That was close, we almost killed the dinosaur.

16
00:00:29,656 --> 00:00:33,152
For today's video we are going to be doing a gingerbread

17
00:00:33,152 --> 00:00:34,831
house building competition.

18
00:00:34,831 --> 00:00:36,101
You're a little bit too far away from me right now.

19
00:00:36,101 --> 00:00:36,934
- Am I?

20
00:00:36,934 --> 00:00:38,474
- There we go, now we're in an uncomfortable place

21
00:00:38,474 --> 00:00:40,730
where we can just kinda tickle each other.

22
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:41,747
But you gotta ask yourself,

23
00:00:41,747 --> 00:00:44,085
what makes this challenge extreme?

24
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:46,789
Two things, thing number one, we are not just using

25
00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:49,416
one gingerbread house each, we are combining

26
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:52,156
two gingerbread houses, and we are using

27
00:00:52,156 --> 00:00:54,789
mega gingerbread houses.

28
00:00:54,789 --> 00:00:55,895
These things are massive.

29
00:00:55,895 --> 00:00:57,740
So we got them laid out in front of us.

30
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,713
You guys can really tell who's the neat sibling

31
00:00:59,713 --> 00:01:00,796
and who is...

32
00:01:01,767 --> 00:01:02,600
No comment.

33
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,844
The next part is that the loser of this challenge,

34
00:01:05,844 --> 00:01:08,761
to make it even more extreme, their gingerbread

35
00:01:08,761 --> 00:01:10,780
house gets destroyed-- - Yes.

36
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,295
- With a sledgehammer.

37
00:01:12,295 --> 00:01:14,676
So that is going to be happening at the end of this video,

38
00:01:14,676 --> 00:01:16,609
so make sure you guys stick around to see whose

39
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:18,663
house gets completely annihilated.

40
00:01:18,663 --> 00:01:20,189
I can't wait for that part, it's gonna be

41
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:21,744
my favorite part of the entire video.

42
00:01:21,744 --> 00:01:24,000

And without further ado, let's jump into the extreme

59
00:01:54,032 --> 00:01:56,039
gingerbread house building competition!

60
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:57,842
(hammer banging) (laughing)

61
00:01:57,842 --> 00:01:59,117
And actually, there is one more thing before

62
00:01:59,117 --> 00:02:00,428
we get started and that is...

63
00:02:00,428 --> 00:02:01,911
I've got some presents here for you Devin.

64
00:02:01,911 --> 00:02:03,102
- Oh, I have some presents for you too.

65
00:02:03,102 --> 00:02:03,935
- Oh, you do?

66
00:02:03,935 --> 00:02:04,768
How sweet of you. - Yeah.

67
00:02:04,768 --> 00:02:06,511
- So here we go, yeah, there you go.

68
00:02:06,511 --> 00:02:08,688
Let's do the big on first 'cause we love presents.

69
00:02:08,688 --> 00:02:10,605
And let's see, oh snap!

70
00:02:11,557 --> 00:02:15,121
We've got-- Dude this is so... (laughing)

71
00:02:15,121 --> 00:02:16,890
Look at my reindeer, what is up?

72
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,849
So we are gonna to be wearing ugly Christmas sweaters

73
00:02:18,849 --> 00:02:19,754
that we got for each other.

74
00:02:19,754 --> 00:02:21,890
- Hey, this guy has some swag going man.

75
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:23,613
- Mine does not, look, he's wearing a bow tie.

76
00:02:23,613 --> 00:02:24,446
What the heck?

77
00:02:24,446 --> 00:02:25,627
And then let's see, what's in the smaller one?

78
00:02:25,627 --> 00:02:27,224
This is-- I'm a little bit concerned right now.

79
00:02:27,224 --> 00:02:28,057
- I have no idea.

80
00:02:28,057 --> 00:02:30,190
- Whatever it is, we're going to have to wear it.

81
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,300
(paper crackling)

82
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,633
- What the heck?

83
00:02:33,933 --> 00:02:36,895
(laughing)

84
00:02:36,895 --> 00:02:37,868
What?

85
00:02:37,868 --> 00:02:39,109
(laughing)

86
00:02:39,109 --> 00:02:41,079
I'm not-- what? (laughing)

87
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:42,313
I don't wanna wear this.

88
00:02:42,313 --> 00:02:45,315
- And now it's time to try these on, so yeah, let's go.

89
00:02:45,315 --> 00:02:46,340
(fingers clicking)

90
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,232
Yo dude-- - What?

91
00:02:48,232 --> 00:02:50,541
- You're actually kinda rock that.

92
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:52,862
Oh, these shorts are ridiculous, check this out.

93
00:02:52,862 --> 00:02:53,930
Look at this.

94
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:54,763
- Oh man.

95
00:02:55,654 --> 00:02:59,589
- Mine's got a little fly. (laughing)

96
00:02:59,589 --> 00:03:01,475
Yeah, do a little wiggle, there we go.

97
00:03:01,475 --> 00:03:02,870
Ay, making jingle bells.

98
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,114
Begins now, go, go! - What?

99
00:03:04,114 --> 00:03:04,979
- All right--

100
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:06,048
- I don't even know where to begin.

101
00:03:06,048 --> 00:03:06,881
- Where do we begin with this?

102
00:03:06,881 --> 00:03:09,168
Well I think actually I need the frosting first.

103
00:03:09,168 --> 00:03:10,847
- Taste good?

104
00:03:10,847 --> 00:03:13,728
It's probably just like pure sugar.

105
00:03:13,728 --> 00:03:14,561
- Eh, tastes okay.

106
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:16,860
Now I think if I just push it all down...

107
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,507
Yeah boy!

108
00:03:18,507 --> 00:03:21,757
Let me just double check, triple check.

109
00:03:23,257 --> 00:03:24,981
Yep, it's working, okay.

110
00:03:24,981 --> 00:03:25,814
- All right.

111
00:03:25,814 --> 00:03:27,691
- You've already got a lot going on there, so I think...

112
00:03:27,691 --> 00:03:28,679
(laughing)

113
00:03:28,679 --> 00:03:31,179
(dance music)

114
00:03:32,851 --> 00:03:34,577
Oh no, I've been putting it all on the wrong side.

115
00:03:34,577 --> 00:03:35,897
So, I put all this on there, but it's not working,

116
00:03:35,897 --> 00:03:38,650
so I have to remove it now.

117
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,128
(laughing)

118
00:03:40,128 --> 00:03:41,397
Now it's been removed from the outside,

119
00:03:41,397 --> 00:03:42,800
now I can put it on the inside where it's suppose to be.

120
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,043
Dude, you're on top of this game.

121
00:03:44,043 --> 00:03:45,111
I don't even know what I'm doing here.

122
00:03:45,111 --> 00:03:48,444
I'm gonna steal Devin's idea, low-key.

123
00:03:48,444 --> 00:03:49,352
- Okay, here we go.

124
00:03:49,352 --> 00:03:50,185
- What are you doing?

125
00:03:50,185 --> 00:03:51,018
- What am I-- What?

126
00:03:51,018 --> 00:03:51,976
- Okay, that looks--

127
00:03:51,976 --> 00:03:52,859
- You have nothing over here man.

128
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:53,692
- All right, actually, you know what?

129
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:54,737
I'm gonna make a cube, a cube of joy.

130
00:03:54,737 --> 00:03:56,386
- Okay, what did I need?

131
00:03:56,386 --> 00:03:57,858
I need watermelons.

132
00:03:57,858 --> 00:03:59,007
- What?

133
00:03:59,007 --> 00:04:00,895
You're almost done, what the heck?

134
00:04:00,895 --> 00:04:01,879
- I'm just too good at this.

135
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:02,823
- Just too good at this.

136
00:04:02,823 --> 00:04:04,755
Yeah, Devin's got some natural talent at this

137
00:04:04,755 --> 00:04:07,010
where I have none.

138
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,016
I'm building like a little Illuminati house guys.

139
00:04:09,016 --> 00:04:12,219
(creepy music)

140
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:13,249
That's what I'm doing.

141
00:04:13,249 --> 00:04:14,516
(laughing)

142
00:04:14,516 --> 00:04:15,586
Oh no!

143
00:04:15,586 --> 00:04:16,985
(laughing)

144
00:04:16,985 --> 00:04:18,010
It almost fully broke.

145
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:19,695
- Get some Cool Whip.

146
00:04:19,695 --> 00:04:21,260
- Why are you using Cool Whip, what the heck?

147
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,286
- What? - Yeah.

148
00:04:22,286 --> 00:04:24,547
- So it's more sturdy on the inside.

149
00:04:24,547 --> 00:04:25,570
- No! (laughing)

150
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,737
Sorry, it almost-- My house is so bad!

151
00:04:27,737 --> 00:04:29,919
- I've actually never tasted Cool Whip before.

152
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:30,752
- You haven't?

153
00:04:30,752 --> 00:04:31,585
- No.

154
00:04:34,962 --> 00:04:36,771
- I don't know how to do this, that's the real issue here.

155
00:04:36,771 --> 00:04:37,604
- It's pretty cool.

156
00:04:37,604 --> 00:04:39,274
- I've realized that just applying this

157
00:04:39,274 --> 00:04:42,105
in a pastry manner is not my specialty.

158
00:04:42,105 --> 00:04:43,378
So I'm gonna go with what I'm really good at,

159
00:04:43,378 --> 00:04:45,595
which is just kinda like playing with my food.

160
00:04:45,595 --> 00:04:47,571
So, I'm just gonna grab a glob of this stuff,

161
00:04:47,571 --> 00:04:49,336
and I think I'm gonna go gorilla mode.

162
00:04:49,336 --> 00:04:50,198
All right, whatever.

163
00:04:50,198 --> 00:04:51,031
Ah man!

164
00:04:51,031 --> 00:04:53,600
This is some cheap, cheap stuff right here.

165
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,433
Look at this.

166
00:04:54,433 --> 00:04:57,124
(hand tapping)

167
00:04:57,124 --> 00:04:59,009
It does not stick at all!

168
00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:00,731
Give me a tip or something 'cause I'm just going

169
00:05:00,731 --> 00:05:03,027
down in flames over here. (laughing)

170
00:05:03,027 --> 00:05:05,813
I'm just trying to-- I don't know.

171
00:05:05,813 --> 00:05:08,160
I can't figure this thing out.

172
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,269
(laughing)

173
00:05:09,269 --> 00:05:11,114
- If you can't precision, just do it every way.

174
00:05:11,114 --> 00:05:11,947
- Yeah!

175
00:05:11,947 --> 00:05:13,570
I need another thing, a triangle 'cause

176
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:15,090
always got keep it Illuminati in this.

177
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:17,673
(creepy music)

178
00:05:18,854 --> 00:05:19,895
- Don't, don't!

179
00:05:19,895 --> 00:05:22,276
- I will give you one of my people from my village

180
00:05:22,276 --> 00:05:24,295
if you can hold this just for a second.

181
00:05:24,295 --> 00:05:25,978
- I don't need your people, but I'll do it anyway

182
00:05:25,978 --> 00:05:26,876
'cause I'm a nice brother. - All right, thank you.

183
00:05:26,876 --> 00:05:28,307
- Wow, your house is...

184
00:05:28,307 --> 00:05:29,371
- Yeah, it's interesting.

185
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:30,204
(laughing)

186
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:32,198
I think this piece will go like this here.

187
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:33,762
Oh, yeah, it goes on this side here.

188
00:05:33,762 --> 00:05:35,488
Oh, there we go.

189
00:05:35,488 --> 00:05:37,170
This is brilliant.

190
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,329
I should of gone into architecture, dang it!

191
00:05:38,329 --> 00:05:39,162
No, no, no!

192
00:05:39,162 --> 00:05:39,995
- Here we go.

193
00:05:39,995 --> 00:05:41,040
(laughing)

194
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,636
All right, so now I've got some Cool Whip

195
00:05:43,636 --> 00:05:45,686
for added structure on the inside.

196
00:05:45,686 --> 00:05:48,519
Just gonna grab a handful of this.

197
00:05:49,502 --> 00:05:52,293
Let's see, just gonna put that in there.

198
00:05:52,293 --> 00:05:55,249
Get another handful of this, gonna put that right there.

199
00:05:55,249 --> 00:05:59,886
Okay, this is all for added structure as well.

200
00:05:59,886 --> 00:06:01,080
- That's a lot of Cool Whip.

201
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,638
- Since my little gingerbread people will probably

202
00:06:02,638 --> 00:06:04,477
be abducted at some point, I'm gonna put them

203
00:06:04,477 --> 00:06:06,322
inside my house.

204
00:06:06,322 --> 00:06:09,721
That way, they will remain safe at all times.

205
00:06:09,721 --> 00:06:10,785
So my little gingerbread people--

206
00:06:10,785 --> 00:06:12,020
Oh, there we go, inside the house, okay.

207
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:12,853
- In the house...

208
00:06:12,853 --> 00:06:13,999
- And then we have another thing of Cool Whip

209
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:16,405
over here just 'cause I wanna make sure that my

210
00:06:16,405 --> 00:06:19,449
house is really fortified on the inside.

211
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:21,872
This is what I do for snow, to really just make

212
00:06:21,872 --> 00:06:23,844
sure that there's snow happening all over it.

213
00:06:23,844 --> 00:06:24,677
All right, there we go.

214
00:06:24,677 --> 00:06:26,228
So that's good for the snow part of what's happening.

215
00:06:26,228 --> 00:06:27,210
This is the decorating part.

216
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:29,258
See how I can just tip my candy?

217
00:06:29,258 --> 00:06:31,794
(candy tinkling)

218
00:06:31,794 --> 00:06:33,845
It is beautiful. - It is literally green.

219
00:06:33,845 --> 00:06:34,703
This can not be--

220
00:06:34,703 --> 00:06:35,974
- All right now for this part here.

221
00:06:35,974 --> 00:06:36,878
(candy tinkling)

222
00:06:36,878 --> 00:06:38,441
Okay, now see these green ones on.

223
00:06:38,441 --> 00:06:39,670
They're pretty big too.

224
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,973
(candy tinkling)

225
00:06:41,973 --> 00:06:43,208
Sprinkle them on there as well.

226
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:44,845
Actually, know you, I do want to build a secondary

227
00:06:44,845 --> 00:06:46,937
house to what's going on.

228
00:06:46,937 --> 00:06:50,052
(dance music)

229
00:06:50,052 --> 00:06:54,157
♫ This is the time of Captain Jack Sparrow

230
00:06:54,157 --> 00:06:58,324
♫ A pirate so brave on the ocean blue

231
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:03,894
♫ A mystical quest to the Isle of Tortuga

232
00:07:03,894 --> 00:07:08,208
♫ Brave, something, sway on the da-da-da

233
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:09,041
(laughing)

234
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:10,757
I can use some of this stuff to glue my Illuminati

235
00:07:10,757 --> 00:07:13,224
house together. (creepy music)

236
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:15,284
- I love your Illuminati house.

237
00:07:15,284 --> 00:07:16,641
What the heck?

238
00:07:16,641 --> 00:07:18,406
- I think this challenge actually perfectly describes

239
00:07:18,406 --> 00:07:21,620
us as siblings, like the difference between our houses

240
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,232
and the sides of our tables.

241
00:07:23,232 --> 00:07:25,454
This pretty much describes the way we go about things.

242
00:07:25,454 --> 00:07:26,599
Yeah, I'm just a mess.

243
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:27,876
All right, here we go, more Cool Whip

244
00:07:27,876 --> 00:07:30,144
for my Illuminati tee-pee.

245
00:07:30,144 --> 00:07:31,786
(creepy music)

246
00:07:31,786 --> 00:07:34,043
Kinda, there we go.

247
00:07:34,043 --> 00:07:35,723
It's on the hand right now, then it's like...

248
00:07:35,723 --> 00:07:36,628
And you just plop it in.

249
00:07:36,628 --> 00:07:37,822
And now it's time to take part three

250
00:07:37,822 --> 00:07:39,503
of the Illuminati cottage.

251
00:07:39,503 --> 00:07:41,194
- Illuminati cottage. (laughing)

252
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:42,591
(creepy music)

253
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:45,341
(candy tinkling)

254
00:07:47,105 --> 00:07:48,577
- All right, so now I've got the candy canes,

255
00:07:48,577 --> 00:07:50,067
and instead of putting the candy canes

256
00:07:50,067 --> 00:07:51,098
and taking them out of the wrapper, I want

257
00:07:51,098 --> 00:07:52,582
to make sure they stay fresh throughout the

258
00:07:52,582 --> 00:07:55,142
holiday season, so I'm just gonna adorn it

259
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:56,698
with the wrapper still on there.

260
00:07:56,698 --> 00:07:57,531
There we go.

261
00:07:57,531 --> 00:07:59,128
- I'm gonna take a thing out of his book,

262
00:07:59,128 --> 00:08:00,768
and I'm gonna do that with these little guys.

263
00:08:00,768 --> 00:08:02,902
Who would want to eat another man's gingerbread house,

264
00:08:02,902 --> 00:08:05,159
and he knows that these things have been touched.

265
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:06,066
- Yeah, I don't wanna do that.

266
00:08:06,066 --> 00:08:07,337
That's no bueno.

267
00:08:07,337 --> 00:08:08,170
- Keep in the wrapper folks.

268
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:09,003
- No bueno.

269
00:08:09,003 --> 00:08:11,034
I really just want to create the atmosphere

270
00:08:11,034 --> 00:08:13,293
of just snow, and so I'm gonna turn my place

271
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:15,465
into the wonderland of snow right now.

272
00:08:15,465 --> 00:08:18,215
(candy tinkling)

273
00:08:21,044 --> 00:08:21,877
There we go.

274
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:23,841
Now it's like a snow kingdom if you guys notice.

275
00:08:23,841 --> 00:08:25,033
(candy tinkling)

276
00:08:25,033 --> 00:08:27,287
My reindeer got decapitated in the process of all this.

277
00:08:27,287 --> 00:08:28,315
- I just know what I'm doing.

278
00:08:28,315 --> 00:08:29,747
- How is that even possible?

279
00:08:29,747 --> 00:08:31,676
- How? I don't know.

280
00:08:31,676 --> 00:08:32,509
- That's crazy.

281
00:08:32,509 --> 00:08:35,612
- My reindeer is gonna be Rudolph.

282
00:08:35,612 --> 00:08:38,849
- Bro, Devin is straight up a savage when it comes to this.

283
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:41,196
He nailed this on so many levels.

284
00:08:41,196 --> 00:08:43,991
I think I'm just gonna kinda, just add a giant

285
00:08:43,991 --> 00:08:45,549
Grinch spice to what's going on.

286
00:08:45,549 --> 00:08:46,497
- Is that my person riding?

287
00:08:46,497 --> 00:08:47,330
- That's the Grinch.

288
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,163
You've got a door?

289
00:08:48,163 --> 00:08:48,996
- Yeah I have a door.

290
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:49,829
- That's so cool.

291
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:51,228
So nice.

292
00:08:51,228 --> 00:08:52,872
- Mmm - How is it?

293
00:08:52,872 --> 00:08:53,975
(laughing)

294
00:08:53,975 --> 00:08:54,969
- I need a Christmas tree.

295
00:08:54,969 --> 00:08:56,529
- Five, four, three, two, one.

296
00:08:56,529 --> 00:08:57,593
- The Christmas tree fell into this area.

297
00:08:57,593 --> 00:08:58,544
- And stop!

298
00:08:58,544 --> 00:09:00,853
These are the final houses.

299
00:09:00,853 --> 00:09:02,245
Devin, would you like to describe yours?

300
00:09:02,245 --> 00:09:04,256
- My house is a luscious house.

301
00:09:04,256 --> 00:09:08,026
It has these mint-condition mints on the top,

302
00:09:08,026 --> 00:09:12,011
and we have some snow on the top as well.

303
00:09:12,011 --> 00:09:14,349
And we have Rudolph perched above

304
00:09:14,349 --> 00:09:16,413
saving the day from this avalanche that has

305
00:09:16,413 --> 00:09:20,072
struck the right side of the house.

306
00:09:20,072 --> 00:09:23,193
We also have a door and a window sill, but no window

307
00:09:23,193 --> 00:09:25,373
because windows are not cool.

308
00:09:25,373 --> 00:09:27,178
They're mainstream, windows are mainstream.

309
00:09:27,178 --> 00:09:28,011
(laughing)

310
00:09:28,011 --> 00:09:30,300
- My house, I really went for the environment.

311
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,809
You have the basic Illuminati household right here,

312
00:09:32,809 --> 00:09:34,415
which is the large Illuminati household.

313
00:09:34,415 --> 00:09:36,923
And then you have the smaller Illuminati--

314
00:09:36,923 --> 00:09:38,767
It's like a little cabin or like a little hut over here.

315
00:09:38,767 --> 00:09:42,007
And then you just have all the great holiday goodness

316
00:09:42,007 --> 00:09:44,342
thrown up into the front yard.

317
00:09:44,342 --> 00:09:46,437
You have a decapitated reindeer.

318
00:09:46,437 --> 00:09:49,556
You've got just all sorts of holiday fun and cheer,

319
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:50,826
and that is my house.

320
00:09:50,826 --> 00:09:51,941
So we're gonna leave this up to you guys.

321
00:09:51,941 --> 00:09:54,073
You guys get to decide who won this.

322
00:09:54,073 --> 00:09:56,085
Did Devin's house win, or did my house win?

323
00:09:56,085 --> 00:09:58,183
So comment down below, let us know who you think won.

324
00:09:58,183 --> 00:10:01,027
And now it's time for the part you've all been waiting for.

325
00:10:01,027 --> 00:10:04,316
It's time to destroy both of these gingerbread houses.

326
00:10:04,316 --> 00:10:06,039
- Woo! Can't wait.

327
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:08,338
- So, yeah, let's get started.

328
00:10:08,338 --> 00:10:09,171
All right, here we go.

329
00:10:09,171 --> 00:10:10,264
I've got my sledgehammer.

330
00:10:10,264 --> 00:10:12,895
We've got Devin's gingerbread house, and yeah,

331
00:10:12,895 --> 00:10:13,838
let's get started.

332
00:10:13,838 --> 00:10:17,861
Three, two, one. (hammer banging)

333
00:10:17,861 --> 00:10:20,111
(laughing)

334
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:24,839
(hammer banging)

335
00:10:28,417 --> 00:10:31,167
(hammer banging)

336
00:10:32,847 --> 00:10:35,597
(hammer banging)

337
00:10:39,299 --> 00:10:42,049
(hammer banging)

338
00:10:45,571 --> 00:10:47,247
Now it's Devin's turn to destroy my house,

339
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:49,834
but instead of using the big sledgehammer,

340
00:10:49,834 --> 00:10:51,188
that's for the big brother, Devin,

341
00:10:51,188 --> 00:10:53,076
you get this little sledgehammer right there.

342
00:10:53,076 --> 00:10:53,909
- Really?

343
00:10:53,909 --> 00:10:54,742
- Yup.

344
00:10:54,742 --> 00:10:55,575
- This is it?

345
00:10:55,575 --> 00:10:56,408
- That's it.

346
00:10:56,408 --> 00:10:58,080
- I don't wanna use this, this is weak.

347
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,947
- Weak?

348
00:10:58,947 --> 00:11:00,101
- I have a much better idea.

349
00:11:00,101 --> 00:11:02,444
- What are you doing? - Yep.

350
00:11:02,444 --> 00:11:03,277
- I'm getting out of here guys,

351
00:11:03,277 --> 00:11:04,622
this is not going to be good.

352
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:05,933
(laughing)

353
00:11:05,933 --> 00:11:06,850
Oh my gosh!

354
00:11:07,948 --> 00:11:11,512
Where'd you even get that thing at?

355
00:11:11,512 --> 00:11:12,910
- It does not matter.

356
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:15,086
- Yo, this is crazy.

357
00:11:15,086 --> 00:11:17,790
(grunting)

358
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:18,623
All right, hold on.

359
00:11:18,623 --> 00:11:19,456
Wait, wait, wait, I wanna film it in slow-mo.

360
00:11:19,456 --> 00:11:20,827
I want to film it in slow-mo, hold on one second.

361
00:11:20,827 --> 00:11:21,660
- All right...

362
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,993
Three, two, one.

363
00:11:25,784 --> 00:11:26,894
(stone crashing)

364
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:27,727

365
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,490

366
00:11:32,551 --> 00:11:33,541
- So now that you've dropped that thing on it,

367
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:35,098

368
00:11:35,098 --> 00:11:36,097
(grunting)

369
00:11:36,097 --> 00:11:37,816
(hammer banging) (upbeat music)

370
00:11:37,816 --> 00:11:38,649
Oh dude, you almost hit me in the face.

371
00:11:38,649 --> 00:11:39,993
Watch out bro, I got this, hold on.

372
00:11:39,993 --> 00:11:40,826
(hammer banging)

373
00:11:40,826 --> 00:11:41,659
I'm gonna hit that rock.

374
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:42,492
Watch out, I'm going for the rock.

375
00:11:42,492 --> 00:11:43,325
(stone smashing)

376
00:11:43,325 --> 00:11:44,395
Oh! (laughing)

377
00:11:44,395 --> 00:11:47,267
(hammer banging)

378
00:11:47,267 --> 00:11:50,716
(hammer banging)

379
00:11:50,716 --> 00:11:53,230
(hammer banging)

380
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,063

381
00:11:54,063 --> 00:11:54,955
I feel like Thor right now.

382
00:11:54,955 --> 00:11:55,788

383
00:11:55,788 --> 00:11:56,767
- We should of got the eyewear.

384
00:11:56,767 --> 00:11:58,204
This is not safe.

385
00:11:58,204 --> 00:12:00,295
- Oh, I hit my finger!

386
00:12:00,295 --> 00:12:02,716
