1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,820
- You challenged us to pull the most insane DIY pranks

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,435
of all time on our unsuspecting friends.

3
00:00:04,435 --> 00:00:05,268
(loud pop) (surprised shouting)

4
00:00:05,268 --> 00:00:06,110
Oh my God!

5
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:07,830
- That's prank number one!

6
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:08,663
- Holy cow!

7
00:00:08,663 --> 00:00:10,300
Alright, our friends are arriving right now

8
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,770
and they think they're just coming over

9
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:12,920
for a normal house tour,

10
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,750
but really it's going to be a nonstop prank war!

11
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,490
And the first prank is with the front door.

12
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,308
We call it the boom stick! Enjoy!

13
00:00:20,308 --> 00:00:22,030
(knocking on door)

14
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:22,943
Yeah, come on in!

15
00:00:24,311 --> 00:00:25,280
(loud pop) (surprised shouting)

16
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,130
Before all the chaos begins, it is time to teach

17
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:29,480
you how to make these super crazy DIY pranks,

18
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,140
But let's rewind it before our friends got here.

19
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,370
It is one hour before our friends get here,

20
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:34,900
so it's time to setup all the pranks.

21
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:35,733
The first one is

22
00:00:35,733 --> 00:00:37,000
the boom stick right here! - Boom!

23
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,240
We're going to be putting it on the front door

24
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,760
to really start off the tour with a bang!

25
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,940
The first prank we are working on is

26
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,190
the mannequin jump scare prank.

27
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:43,353
So basically a friend of ours is gonna get

28
00:00:43,353 --> 00:00:45,440
in a zombie costume, stand super still,

29
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,273
and at the right moment jump out!

30
00:00:46,273 --> 00:00:48,580
(screaming)

31
00:00:49,881 --> 00:00:50,714
- Was that a good reaction?

32
00:00:50,714 --> 00:00:51,730
- No, that wasn't good at all.

33
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:52,690
- That was a nice little run. - It was a little extra.

34
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,170
- So we're also going to have an edible brain.

35
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:55,990
Some snakes kinda scattered around our friend

36
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:56,823
in the zombie costume.

37
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:57,840
I'm making the edible brain.

38
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,790
- And I'm making the snakes.

39
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:00,640
- But right now I'm going to add in some pecans over here,

40
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,473
like this.

41
00:01:01,473 --> 00:01:02,306
- I've got my string here,

42
00:01:02,306 --> 00:01:03,980
and this is outlining where the snakes are gonna go.

43
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:04,945
And this is the, the.

44
00:01:04,945 --> 00:01:05,784
(suspenseful music)

45
00:01:05,784 --> 00:01:06,617
(laughs)

46
00:01:06,617 --> 00:01:07,450
- Gotta be careful where you point that thing.

47
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:08,283
- This is for gaps and cracks.

48
00:01:08,283 --> 00:01:09,116
- Next thing I need for the edible brain

49
00:01:09,116 --> 00:01:10,470
there's a whole bunch of peanut butter here.

50
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:11,451
So Devan you've got some gloves on

51
00:01:11,451 --> 00:01:12,284
can you open that for me?

52
00:01:12,284 --> 00:01:13,117
- I do, I will help.

53
00:01:13,117 --> 00:01:14,800
(both screaming)

54
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,001
- Also, I forgot to mention - Dude

55
00:01:16,001 --> 00:01:17,120
- We're going to be pranking each other

56
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:17,953
as we go through this.

57
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:18,786
- Yeah

58
00:01:18,786 --> 00:01:19,619
- Definitely found my first prank.

59
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:20,452
- All right.

60
00:01:20,452 --> 00:01:21,285
- The war is on bro! - It is on!

61
00:01:21,285 --> 00:01:22,410
- So here we go, I got some real peanut butter over here.

62
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,010
So, just gonna add this in.

63
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:24,843
- Jeez dude.

64
00:01:24,843 --> 00:01:25,676
- So here it goes,

65
00:01:25,676 --> 00:01:26,509
squeeze it in.

66
00:01:26,509 --> 00:01:27,440
- (high pitched voice) Squeeze!

67
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,150
- We got the ambiguous chihuahua cat-dog.

68
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:31,060
(cultural festive music)

69
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,873
- Still can't tell whether or not it's a cat or a dog.

70
00:01:32,873 --> 00:01:33,797
- Hoooo!

71
00:01:33,797 --> 00:01:34,630
(chuckles)

72
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:35,463
- Powdered sugar.

73
00:01:35,463 --> 00:01:36,440
We're gonna add this in right now.

74
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,127
So there we go, okay boom!

75
00:01:38,127 --> 00:01:38,979
- Smack that!

76
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:39,812
Sorry!

77
00:01:39,812 --> 00:01:40,850
- Was that a prank too, man?

78
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,230
- I don't know, I meant to smack it but

79
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,550
I forgot it was in a hinge and its flung.

80
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:44,387
- [Devan] Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

81
00:01:44,387 --> 00:01:45,220
- [Collins] Oh, man!

82
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,760
- [Devan] So I'm gonna coil it around the string here.

83
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,570
- I gotta say man, you do not have a steady hand.

84
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:49,403
But me!

85
00:01:49,403 --> 00:01:50,670
(smacks)

86
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:51,510
Yeah, I gotta steady hand.

87
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,755
- [Collins] All right, well here we are,

88
00:01:52,755 --> 00:01:53,588
we're gonna get in here and just kinda,

89
00:01:53,588 --> 00:01:54,421
mix all this up.

90
00:01:54,421 --> 00:01:55,254
- So, the shape of the snake is done.

91
00:01:55,254 --> 00:01:56,653
Now, I just have to clear this away,

92
00:01:56,653 --> 00:01:58,360
and make the skin of the snake.

93
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,193
- [Collins] Dude, I nailed it!

94
00:01:59,193 --> 00:02:00,026
- [Devan] Wow! - [Collins] That's the perfect like,

95
00:02:00,026 --> 00:02:01,210
play dough consistency.

96
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:02,200
I gotta get the brain mold.

97
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,033
- Oh wait. - Where you going?

98
00:02:03,033 --> 00:02:03,866
- We're both leaving?

99
00:02:03,866 --> 00:02:04,699
- No, no, no, no, no!

100
00:02:04,699 --> 00:02:05,532
Gimme the brain (stumbles)

101
00:02:05,532 --> 00:02:06,365
- Goodbye!

102
00:02:06,365 --> 00:02:07,306
- Right there. All right, now that Devan's gone,

103
00:02:07,306 --> 00:02:08,226
I've got some extra pranks for him,

104
00:02:08,226 --> 00:02:09,820
so (shushes) don't say anything.

105
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:10,700
- [Devan] Are you talking to me, Collins?

106
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:11,993
- Nope, no you're good Devan!

107
00:02:11,993 --> 00:02:12,950
- [Devan] I got the clay.

108
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,240
- Wait, from upstair- wait, wait,

109
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,630
you just left to the, what?

110
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,463
I'm super confused.

111
00:02:16,463 --> 00:02:17,429
Aye! My brain mold!

112
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:18,262
- Whoa, what, what, what do you mean?

113
00:02:18,262 --> 00:02:19,250
- [Collins] It's clear, it's a clear brain mold.

114
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,083
- I can see it.

115
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:21,026
- So here we go, just gonna plop and drop.

116
00:02:21,026 --> 00:02:21,859
(whistle) (boom) - [Devan] Plop and drop!

117
00:02:21,859 --> 00:02:23,070
- [Collins] Bam! Gonna add in a little bit more

118
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,710
peanut butter. But, time to pop this thing in the fridge.

119
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:25,970
I'm gonna add a beautiful glaze.

120
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:29,490
- I'm gonna start rolling out this clay here.

121
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,720
(chuckles) What're doing dude?

122
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,553
Just leave dude! (stumbles)

123
00:02:31,553 --> 00:02:33,730
What's your issue? You got problems leaving bro?

124
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:34,780
All right, now that Collins is gone.

125
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,502
I'm actually gonna prank him with this rubber brick.

126
00:02:36,502 --> 00:02:37,335
(chicken clucks)

127
00:02:37,335 --> 00:02:38,960
Whoa! Dude, what! - [Collins] I'm back!

128
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,793
I'm back!

129
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:40,630
- How did you get there?

130
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,463
- I'm a ninja!

131
00:02:41,463 --> 00:02:42,390
- And you heard nothing, right?

132
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,223
- Yeah, yeah, no what's up?

133
00:02:43,223 --> 00:02:44,903
- I just got a brick here.

134
00:02:44,903 --> 00:02:45,736
(screams)

135
00:02:45,736 --> 00:02:46,930
- That actually hurt! What was the prank?

136
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,230
- It's a rubber brick

137
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:49,630
- Okay, so it hurt less than a real brick.

138
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,463
But you still smacked me.

139
00:02:50,463 --> 00:02:52,090
- All right, just gotta roll this stuff out.

140
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:52,923
- Yup, and for this time,

141
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:54,350
I'm for real gonna go grab my brain out of the fridge.

142
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:55,787
All right, so my brain is all frozen down. - Oh!

143
00:02:55,787 --> 00:02:57,437
- I have a serious brain freeze right now.

144
00:02:57,437 --> 00:02:58,270
As you can tell.

145
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,103
(chuckles)

146
00:02:59,103 --> 00:03:00,170
It's got very cold.

147
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:01,003
- Oh yeah, (sizzles)

148
00:03:01,003 --> 00:03:01,836
Whoa! Wow!

149
00:03:01,836 --> 00:03:03,070
- Here we're going to take our frozen brain,

150
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:05,300
plop and drop. And then we're gonna start to make a-

151
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,270
- A lot more drop.

152
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,400
- Here we go, this is-

153
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,435
- Well, before you do that, I have the clay rolled out

154
00:03:09,435 --> 00:03:12,340
and I'm gonna add the scales with this mesh stuff here.

155
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,770
- Actually, can you hand me that pan down over there, Devan?

156
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:14,610
- Oh yeah, sure. -That would be perfect.

157
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:15,790
So here we go, pick up my brain,

158
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:17,230
pop the brain in the pan like that. - Here you go.

159
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,063
- What are you up to?

160
00:03:18,063 --> 00:03:19,062
- I didn't know which way I wanted to do.

161
00:03:19,062 --> 00:03:20,020
- That was a last minute change.

162
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,020
- [Collins] Ready, three,

163
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,290
- [Both] two, one.

164
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:23,123
- [Collins] Let's go for the pour.

165
00:03:23,123 --> 00:03:24,156
- [Both] Ooooooo.

166
00:03:24,156 --> 00:03:25,290
- [Devan] That looked cool!

167
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,123
- [Collins] Here we go.

168
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:26,956
- [Devan] That looked really cool!

169
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:27,789
- But don't pour it too much. - Ooooooo! What?

170
00:03:27,789 --> 00:03:29,496
- All right, we got all the pranks set in room number one.

171
00:03:29,496 --> 00:03:30,430
(struggling)

172
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,263
- [Collins] What! Holy cow!

173
00:03:31,263 --> 00:03:32,380
He's having a little bit of trouble man.

174
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,258
- [Both] Whoa!

175
00:03:33,258 --> 00:03:35,660
- [Collins] Okay, that was actually very close to my face.

176
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,410
Right now, let's get to the pranks.

177
00:03:39,301 --> 00:03:42,083
(loud pop) (surprised shouting)

178
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:44,570
- Welcome to the house! Yes! Okay! - Dude!

179
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:45,990
- We haven't actually officially done a house tour,

180
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,823
as you can tell.

181
00:03:46,823 --> 00:03:48,150
- Yes. - We got the camera too, if you guys wanna wave!

182
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:48,983
- Hey! - What's up!

183
00:03:48,983 --> 00:03:49,816
- But, as you guys can tell,

184
00:03:49,816 --> 00:03:50,649
this isn't a normal house tour.

185
00:03:50,649 --> 00:03:51,887
We got a whole bunch of fun things we wanna show you.

186
00:03:51,887 --> 00:03:53,282
So, the first one, is actually over here.

187
00:03:53,282 --> 00:03:54,115
- Yeah.

188
00:03:54,115 --> 00:03:56,290
- This is our pre-Halloween decoration. (laughs)

189
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,890
So as you can tell, we got a whole bunch of fun stuff.

190
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:59,740
We got some snakes. Devan actually made the snakes.

191
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,573
- I did! Yeah, yeah. -Yup

192
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,460
- [Devan] These actually are made out of

193
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,022
cardboard and stuff. And they kinda slither.

194
00:04:04,022 --> 00:04:05,163
- Wow! - Yeah. - They look so real.

195
00:04:05,163 --> 00:04:07,540
- Yeah, exactly. So this here is the edible gummy brain.

196
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,810
We actually just made this in the video.

197
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:09,643
Wanna touch it?

198
00:04:09,643 --> 00:04:10,476
(scaring sound) (shrieks)

199
00:04:10,476 --> 00:04:11,309
(laughter)

200
00:04:11,309 --> 00:04:12,142
- [Collins] And of course, last but not least,

201
00:04:12,142 --> 00:04:12,975
we have the mannequin. (amazement)

202
00:04:12,975 --> 00:04:14,270
Don't worry we're not trying to scare you guys.

203
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,682
- Argh! (screaming)

204
00:04:15,682 --> 00:04:17,241
(laughter)

205
00:04:17,241 --> 00:04:18,220
- [Devan] I am so sorry!

206
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,053
- [Collins] Holy cow!

207
00:04:19,053 --> 00:04:19,886
- [Devan] Are you good dude? Are you okay?

208
00:04:19,886 --> 00:04:20,719
- [Collins] Okay. I don't know what to say.

209
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:22,340
- On the ground, man. Yes! - Holy cow! All right,

210
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,150
well, that's our friend Conrad!

211
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,850
- [Devan] You okay? - That got me. That was a lot.

212
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:26,683
All right well.

213
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:27,780
(chuckles) You're checking your pulse.

214
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,040
So, no more surprises, normal house tour from here on out.

215
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,560
- Wait, Collins, I forgot to clean out the boxes.

216
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,393
- Yep, let's get those out of here, all right. - Let me just

217
00:04:32,393 --> 00:04:33,226
grab these.

218
00:04:33,226 --> 00:04:34,059
- So, the next thing that we're going to be doing

219
00:04:34,059 --> 00:04:35,254
is that we're going to be hopping into...

220
00:04:35,254 --> 00:04:37,201
(screaming) (laughter)

221
00:04:37,201 --> 00:04:38,573
- I forgot about that one.

222
00:04:38,573 --> 00:04:39,884
- No more surprises, ah. - No more surprises going on.

223
00:04:39,884 --> 00:04:40,717
- Yeah, right?

224
00:04:40,717 --> 00:04:42,630
(stumbles)

225
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:45,275
- It's a prank house tour, so da da!

226
00:04:45,275 --> 00:04:46,370
All right, we got a couple rooms we're

227
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,727
going into for this prank tour right now.

228
00:04:47,727 --> 00:04:49,490
All right guys, follow me into the kitchen.

229
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,420
- [Devan] Oh! Looks like he found my bonus prank.

230
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,337
Let's go back to before our friends arrived to show you

231
00:04:53,337 --> 00:04:55,050
how to make the next set of pranks.

232
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,020
- Next up in the kitchen,

233
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,770
we are doing the prank food roulette challenge. - Yup.

234
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,530
- So basically, we've got twelve different foods

235
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:01,542
and half of them are normal delicious foods.

236
00:05:01,542 --> 00:05:03,720
(screaming) - No whoa! What! - The other half of them

237
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,553
are prank foods.

238
00:05:04,553 --> 00:05:05,570
- Are you kidding me?

239
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:06,663
- And are guests have no idea which are which.

240
00:05:06,663 --> 00:05:09,230
And here's the twist, they get to choose what they eat

241
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,690
and what we eat. So they'll be getting pranked,

242
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:12,241
we'll be getting pranked. There's gonna be lots of pranks.

243
00:05:12,241 --> 00:05:13,074
- Get out of here with these pranks!

244
00:05:13,074 --> 00:05:14,230
- That actually kinda hurts a little bit.

245
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,663
All right, so right now let's make some prank food.

246
00:05:15,663 --> 00:05:16,920
- Hiya! - No!

247
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,980
- So, for my first prank,

248
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,190
I'm making Lil' Debbie birthday cakes.

249
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,660
- Lil' Debbie birthday cakes!

250
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,810
How can you make Little Debbie birthday cakes without me!

251
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:24,643
Little Debbie!

252
00:05:24,643 --> 00:05:26,090
- You're definitely not Little Debbie.

253
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:28,270
- What talking about man! Totally Lil' (stumbles)

254
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,480
full on Deb!

255
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,220
- [Devan] There's just no way man. - I'm Debra!

256
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,250
- Collins, what is this?

257
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,083
- I don't think you should look at that.

258
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,106
- Are you trying to prank me here?

259
00:05:34,106 --> 00:05:35,520
- Don't pay attention to the tape.

260
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,990
It has nothing to do with anything. (sparkle noises)

261
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:38,560
- See, I would grab a new package,

262
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,547
but this is the only one we have and I need this.

263
00:05:40,547 --> 00:05:43,123
- Mhm, yes. That's, yes. Look, aw wait, wait, wait.

264
00:05:43,123 --> 00:05:45,340
- What're you doing? What're you? What're you? (smacks)

265
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,112
- Pick that up! Pick it up real quick. - Fine, fine.

266
00:05:47,112 --> 00:05:48,520
(thuds)

267
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,600
- Cool, all righst so we're good here.

268
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,900
- What did you do?

269
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,540
- Totally nothing at all. - Really?

270
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,410
- I'm glad we have your only box

271
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:54,720
of Lil' Debbie birthday cakes.

272
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,120
- They're over there! We have more boxes!

273
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,986
- All right, while you do that, I'm gonna add in some

274
00:05:56,986 --> 00:05:59,500
sriracha into my agar agar over here. (suspenseful music)

275
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,570
- Whoa! Okay, wait. No, there's nothing in here.

276
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:02,980
- Might've been one of these. I might've mixed it up.

277
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:03,830
We'll save it for when our friends

278
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,159
get here later and then prank! - Deet!

279
00:06:05,159 --> 00:06:06,280
- What's that? - It's a Lil' deet!

280
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,910
- All right, so add in the sriracha sauce into the

281
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,337
agar agar and now it's time to mix it all up.

282
00:06:09,337 --> 00:06:11,480
So, gotta boil this, cook it up right now, and then

283
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,860
make the little sriracha balls.

284
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,880
- [Devan] Wait, aren't sponges normally wet when they

285
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,753
come out of the packaging man?

286
00:06:15,753 --> 00:06:17,450
- What? They're all this way?

287
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:19,520
- Its been a while since I've- No! These are mine.

288
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,888
- Three, two, one! (squeeze)

289
00:06:20,888 --> 00:06:22,055
- [Both] Whoa!

290
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:25,660
- We made it back, oh, we're crossing!

291
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,980
- [Devan] I just got to cut these sponges

292
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,160
in the shape of the Little Debbie birthday cakes.

293
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,490
- All right, well, I've got this jar right here.

294
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,690
So, now its time to strain out the sriracha caviar.

295
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,300
So, we have some cold vegetable oil over here.

296
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,360
Stand right there... its cold.

297
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,463
- Ah. - Ha ha, pranked!

298
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:39,110
- There we go, there we go. - My number one pet peeve

299
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,615
is oily fingers so, yeah.

300
00:06:40,615 --> 00:06:41,460
- Oh.

301
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,320
Gonna suck up some little sriracha goblets....

302
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,560
droplets, what?

303
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,530
- Gotta figure out how many Little Debbie birthday cakes

304
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,410
come in one package, so I can make that amount.

305
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:50,450
- Can you please say that, like a tiny-

306
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,680
- Lil' Debbie birthday cakes!

307
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,320
- Cause' it's not like birthday, its like bird day!

308
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,040
- [Collins] Now it's time to harvest my sriracha caviar,

309
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,873
so here we go.

310
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:57,017
- Wait, harvest it? What the- - Yup, I gotta-

311
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:57,850
- What?

312
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:58,687
- [Collins] Well it's in there you gotta get it out.

313
00:06:58,687 --> 00:06:59,847
That's not gonna fit, okay.

314
00:06:59,847 --> 00:07:00,730
- [Collins] All right, let's see if we can just,

315
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:03,727
scoop down into it. Oh! There we go! Boom! Look at that!

316
00:07:03,727 --> 00:07:05,513
- [Devan] And it looks so convincing!

317
00:07:05,513 --> 00:07:07,620
- [Collins] Yo! This is baller!

318
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,114
- [Devan] So, I'm actually putting edible frosting

319
00:07:09,114 --> 00:07:11,030
on the inside of these sponges.

320
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,132
- Next prank is silly string in the fridge!

321
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:12,965
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! - Oh sorry!

322
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:14,400
That was pointed the wrong way! - What was that?

323
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,380
- Or was it a prank!

324
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,467
(screaming)

325
00:07:16,467 --> 00:07:17,590
- Got you bro! - No, no why!

326
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:19,210
- So basically, I'm going to be putting these

327
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:21,020
silly string things in the fridge. So that way when our

328
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,870
guests open up the fridge, gonna blast em'!

329
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,820
- Where are you gonna put them in the- Agh!

330
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,653
- Sorry.

331
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:26,486
- Where are you gonna put them in the fridge dude!

332
00:07:26,486 --> 00:07:27,319
- Oh well, see that's the thing is that I'll-

333
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:28,610
I'll take it out, I'll take it out, I'll take it out!

334
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,500
Let's see, I don't know,

335
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,601
maybe top shelf would be good or something-

336
00:07:31,601 --> 00:07:32,434
(screams)

337
00:07:32,434 --> 00:07:33,400
- [Devan] Yes! - Oh my gosh!

338
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,890
Two snakes? - Yes dude!

339
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:36,200
- Was that necessary, Devan? - Oh yeah!

340
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,660
- One wouldn't do the job? - Nope.

341
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,140
- [Devan] I got some white chocolate here

342
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,840
that I'm dipping these Lil' Debbie birthday cakes into.

343
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,673
- Bird day cakes.

344
00:07:42,673 --> 00:07:43,506
So, to make this silly string prank,

345
00:07:43,506 --> 00:07:45,200
what I'm basically gonna do is take a thumbtack

346
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,010
and stick it right in the hole that the silly string

347
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:47,843
comes out of.

348
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:48,680
I don't know the technical term for it.

349
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,360
Press it down like, there we go, okay, and then here we go,

350
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,193
tape it on the sides like this.

351
00:07:51,193 --> 00:07:52,900
All right, next up it is time for the

352
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,510
mayonnaise and ice cream prank so basically-

353
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,792
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, what's in your pocket! Dude!

354
00:07:55,792 --> 00:07:56,730
(screaming) It's on fire, it's on fire!

355
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:58,340
- Oh my gosh! Dude, wait, wait, wait, wait.

356
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,030
- Ooooh! - You put something in the lemon bag?

357
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:00,863
- It's a prank!

358
00:08:00,863 --> 00:08:02,513
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, you put a smoker in the lemon bag.

359
00:08:02,513 --> 00:08:04,430
- I did. This is a bigger prank as well,

360
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,640
that involves our oven.

361
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,867
- Wait, we're pranking our oven now?

362
00:08:06,867 --> 00:08:08,890
How is mom gonna make her delicious banana bread

363
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:09,747
if we're pranking the oven?

364
00:08:09,747 --> 00:08:11,520
- Are you kidding? We have multiple ovens.

365
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,534
You got, one, two, three, four ovens.

366
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:15,290
- That's an impressive quantity of ovens.

367
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:17,080
Next up is the ice cream and mayonnaise prank.

368
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,510
Basically, you replace a whole mayonnaise jar

369
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,649
with delicious ice cream.

370
00:08:19,649 --> 00:08:21,886
- Nice, wait dude, I wanna try this thing. - Mmm

371
00:08:21,886 --> 00:08:22,719
- Mm hmm - Hold up.

372
00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:25,431
- Wahoo! (suspenseful music) - Whoa! What was that?

373
00:08:25,431 --> 00:08:26,920
- That's the real stuff. - No!

374
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,753
- Pranked!

375
00:08:27,753 --> 00:08:29,425
(Both mumbling)

376
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:30,258
- Raugh!

377
00:08:30,258 --> 00:08:31,091
- My prank is-

378
00:08:31,091 --> 00:08:32,360
- Ha! - Excuse me.

379
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,060
That was a prank. Ha ha, gotcha.

380
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,968
I'm using this fog machine, putting it in the oven.

381
00:08:35,968 --> 00:08:39,060
So, you'll see. I got one of the trays locked in here man.

382
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,636
- Maybe, we turn the oven on. - No! No, n-

383
00:08:40,636 --> 00:08:42,770
You actually press the button. (chuckles)

384
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:44,109
First tray is out man.

385
00:08:44,109 --> 00:08:44,948
- I thought they were racks.

386
00:08:44,948 --> 00:08:46,606
(cool music)

387
00:08:46,606 --> 00:08:49,560
- [Devan] Next up, I'm taking this big speaker here.

388
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,023
- Holy cow! - And I'm puttin' this in the oven as well.

389
00:08:51,023 --> 00:08:52,880
- Feel like a block party with that thing. -Yes.

390
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,070
- Are we gonna have like a- is this like a-

391
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,013
- You'll see, you'll see. -Oh!

392
00:08:55,013 --> 00:08:57,020
Is it like a broken oven prank.

393
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,970
It's gonna scare me. - No dude, it's not that scary.

394
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:01,400
(boom) Oh my gosh! Holy cow!

395
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,066
- For my next food prank, I'm making garlic Almond Joy's

396
00:09:04,066 --> 00:09:05,420
- All right, well, I'm gonna keep filling up

397
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,253
the mayonnaise in here.

398
00:09:06,253 --> 00:09:07,700
All right, next thing I'm gonna have to do is freeze

399
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,602
this whole container righ-

400
00:09:08,602 --> 00:09:10,274
- Garlic! (sparkly noises) - What?

401
00:09:10,274 --> 00:09:13,231
- Ha! It's like a movie man. Your like, what!

402
00:09:13,231 --> 00:09:14,398
- What?

403
00:09:14,398 --> 00:09:15,600
- All right, Collins take a whiff.

404
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,550
- No, no, no, no. All right, here we go,

405
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,156
gonna pop this in the freezer right now.

406
00:09:19,156 --> 00:09:20,780
(elevator music)

407
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:21,940
- [Collins] All right, while he's doing that I think that

408
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,930
my ice cream is finally frozen so, here we go,

409
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,510
gonna pull it out. Ta da!

410
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:27,755
- Wow! Whoa! No way! - That looks just like ice cream bro.

411
00:09:27,755 --> 00:09:29,635
- Wanna take a taste of it real quick. - No!

412
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:31,290
- Cause' you know what the real stuff tastes like

413
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:33,290
- Ah no! - All right, so I'm gonna pull this mold off and

414
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:36,510
ta da! Oh, oh! I'm gonna top it off, instead of an almond,

415
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,610
use garlic cloves.

416
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,250
- My eyes are watering and that's not even an onion.

417
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,260
- But I do have some onions, just wait.

418
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,467
- Oh god. I'm out, I'm out. (laughs) I quit.

419
00:09:43,467 --> 00:09:44,773
(sad music) - Come back!

420
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:49,050
All right, the last thing I gotta do for my garlic joy

421
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,750
is add some chocolate on the top.

422
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,090
- I've got some chicken gravy over here.

423
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:54,100
Which I'm playing with off as butterscotch gravy, but

424
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,108
its actually made out of chicken.

425
00:09:55,108 --> 00:09:56,173
- Ugh! - [Collins] Here we got some Crisco.

426
00:09:56,173 --> 00:09:58,334
- It's like melting it. - Yeah it's kinda coagulating.

427
00:09:58,334 --> 00:10:00,180
Here we go, we use this Crisco as kinda like the

428
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,690
whipped cream on the top. I'm gonna have to clean it up

429
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:02,560
a little bit but I think this is a pretty

430
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,680
convincing ice cream dessert. - Yeah.

431
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,964
- So I'm gonna pop this in the fridge.

432
00:10:04,964 --> 00:10:07,190
- This next one is a very tricky one

433
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,560
and we'll definitely get our unsuspecting guests.

434
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,507
- Yeah very tricky. Why'd you drop all my pickles over here.

435
00:10:11,507 --> 00:10:13,313
All right, cool, pickles are fully washed so-

436
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:16,053
- Wait a second, isn't a pickled cucumber just a pickle?

437
00:10:16,053 --> 00:10:17,500
(crickets)

438
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,960
- Yeah but I'm going for the gusto on the name.

439
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,561
- Begin crying in three, two, one, yeah.

440
00:10:21,561 --> 00:10:23,860
(crying)

441
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:26,187
- Oh my gosh! My pickles!

442
00:10:26,187 --> 00:10:27,440
(laughing)

443
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,498
I don't know. If your gonna cry over something,

444
00:10:28,498 --> 00:10:29,350
mind as well crying over your pickles.

445
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:30,846
All right so, here we go, got a pickle on a stick.

446
00:10:30,846 --> 00:10:33,035
Hohoo! That's cool.

447
00:10:33,035 --> 00:10:35,930
Oooooo. - It's very, very satisfying.

448
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:37,260
Now I just gotta stick it in the caramel

449
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,187
and we have a fake caramel apple.

450
00:10:39,187 --> 00:10:41,628
- All right, well, it's... done!

451
00:10:41,628 --> 00:10:43,000
- Ha, it is?

452
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,833
- It is!

453
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,480
We're just gonna have to hope that it passes as a banana.

454
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,710
- It's definitely not a banana.

455
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,120
All right, so I've added some sprinkles but

456
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,990
to add some more I need this egg.

457
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:50,982
- That doesn't make any sense - What do you mean?

458
00:10:50,982 --> 00:10:52,440
- How's an egg gonna add sprinkles - I'm gonna use this egg

459
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,147
to crack it on head. - You're gonna- No, no, no, no, no!

460
00:10:54,147 --> 00:10:56,860
No! no, no, no, no! Devan, Devan! - Oh! Look at that.

461
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,940
- What? What on Earth? - I'm adding the sprinkles.

462
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,140
What did you think was gonna happen?

463
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,120
- You have an egg, what did you think, I think would happen?

464
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,470
- You're crazy, dude. And I think I actually

465
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,590
need some more sprinkles, so I got another egg right here.

466
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:06,950
You ready? - Yup, yeah, go for it. (cracks)

467
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:09,507
- Oh! - That was a real one! That was a real one!

468
00:11:09,507 --> 00:11:10,810
All right, well now it's time to set everything up

469
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,080
and get this room ready for our friends.

470
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,424
We got fridge pranks, oven pranks,

471
00:11:13,424 --> 00:11:15,080
and a whole bunch of real fake foods.

472
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,570
So, right now let's get it all ready

473
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:18,550
and I gotta take a shower, bro. - Sorry about that bro.

474
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,080
- Are you kidding me?

475
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,000
- Follow me into the kitchen.

476
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,630
- Oh, dude yes! - Holy cow!

477
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:25,660
- That's right bro. -Tape?

478
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:28,015
- I pranked ya! - Are you kidding me? - Yup I'm sorry dude.

479
00:11:28,015 --> 00:11:29,060
I had to do it.

480
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,559
- Okay well, watch out for that

481
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:32,620
there's more in the kitchen. What the heck?

482
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,500
All right guys, so this is the next room right here,

483
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,030
the kitchen. So this is the prank food roulette challenge.

484
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,380
So basically, you guys get to choose which foods you

485
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,160
wanna eat and which foods you want Devan and I to eat.

486
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,860
- Yeah so, choose wisely. - Yes.

487
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,520
On the count of three point to the food you wanna eat.

488

00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:48,490
- [Collins] Oh caviar, ice cream, and oreo.

491
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:49,780
Bella, you get to choose my food,

Three, two, one, go! (ding)

496
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,080

497
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,890
- [Devan] All right, well, it already smells and kinda

498
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:01,293

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,920
- [Collins] Go for it!

501
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,472
Oh! Why was it so squishy? - [Ava] What is that?

502
00:12:05,472 --> 00:12:06,679
- It was an onion!

503
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:07,980
(disgusted exclaims)

504
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,762
- Wait a second, it actually made the onion kinda sweet.

505
00:12:10,762 --> 00:12:13,433
- No way! - Awww. - Boo!

506
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:15,763
- [Collins] All right Bella,

507
00:12:15,763 --> 00:12:17,836
so you've got the next one here, you've got this sundae.

508
00:12:17,836 --> 00:12:20,030
- Oh, what if it's a tomato!

509
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,540
- She hates tomatoes by the way.

510
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,373
- [Bella] I hate tomatoes.

511
00:12:22,373 --> 00:12:23,470
- You ready here we go.

512
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,030
- [Everyone] Three, two, one.

513
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:25,863
- [Collins] Let's see.

514
00:12:25,863 --> 00:12:26,696
- [Devan] What it taste like?

515
00:12:26,696 --> 00:12:27,529
- [Collins] Is it ice cream?

516
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:29,687
- Is it? - Is it? Oh! That's not ice cream.

517
00:12:29,687 --> 00:12:30,520
- What is it?

518
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,678
- It's a tomato. (laughter)

519
00:12:31,678 --> 00:12:32,793
- Yeah!

520
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:36,530
- Fun fact, its tomato, mayo, Crisco, and I think there's

521
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:39,030
like some chicken broth in there. - Oh my god!

522
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:39,996
- Yeah, so- (laughs)

523
00:12:39,996 --> 00:12:42,870
So, unfortunately, we're two for two right now with

524
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:45,190
the prank foods. So hopefully this next one, Christian.

525
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,730
- [Collins] Do you think that's a prank food or not?

526
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:49,537
- [Christian] I think these are packaged Oreos,

527
00:12:49,537 --> 00:12:50,875
that's why I picked them.

528
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:53,125
(laughter)

529
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,073
- All right, lets take a bite. (explosion)

530
00:12:55,073 --> 00:12:58,075
(shocked screams)

531
00:12:58,075 --> 00:13:00,190
- The oven broke! So like, I take that, yeah.

532
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:02,250
I totally actually forgot about this prank.

533
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,160
So yeah, this is the broken oven prank.

534
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,477
- [Devan] Lets see how it tastes go for it.

535
00:13:05,477 --> 00:13:06,310
(crunch)

536
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:07,327
- [Collins] What's it taste like - [Devan] What is it?

537
00:13:07,327 --> 00:13:08,741
- It's just an Oreo.

538
00:13:08,741 --> 00:13:09,574
(celebration music) (exclaims)

539
00:13:09,574 --> 00:13:10,930
- I was about to say, wait a second,

540
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:12,307
I didn't do anything to that.

541
00:13:12,307 --> 00:13:15,150
- And just like that we're onto Ava. So, Ava, you got these

542
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:17,090
nice little lovely looking caviar chips.

543
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:18,255
- [Ava] I'm slowly getting more and more nervous.

544
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:19,088
- [Collins] Here we go.

545
00:13:19,088 --> 00:13:20,679
- [Everyone] Three, two.

546
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:21,512
(mumbles)

547
00:13:21,512 --> 00:13:22,560
- We wanna see if you could like this video

548
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,260
in three seconds, you ready?

549
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:27,952
Here we go, three, two, one, done.

550
00:13:27,952 --> 00:13:28,785
All right, here we go, you ready?

551
00:13:28,785 --> 00:13:30,570
- [Collins And Devan] Three, two, one.

552
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:32,360
- [Collins] Go for it. We wait.

553
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,193
- Not good?

554
00:13:33,193 --> 00:13:34,169
- Ugh! And its spicy.

555
00:13:34,169 --> 00:13:35,422
(laughter)

556
00:13:35,422 --> 00:13:36,900
- It's spicy? - It's spicy.

557
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,081
- It's actually sriracha caviar. (panicking)

558
00:13:40,081 --> 00:13:41,340
- Oh my god!

559
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,030
- [Devan] Well, now its on to Collins, man.

560
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,870
- Do you guys think this is, I mean like look, it's-

561
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,110
- It looks pretty legit.

562
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,450
- [Collins] It's in packages. - [Ava] Yeah.

563
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:48,370
- [Collins] It's fully packaged.

564
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,203
You ready, here we go.

565
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,150
- [Everyone] Three, two, one.

566
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:53,233
- [Devan] Aye! It's normal. - Aww.

567
00:13:54,257 --> 00:13:55,667
- Oh! I thought it was a prank!

568
00:13:55,667 --> 00:13:57,005
- Haha, no, it's just a normal one.

569
00:13:57,005 --> 00:13:57,838
(celebrates)

570
00:13:57,838 --> 00:13:59,140
- Now it's time for us to eat

571
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,197
the next prank food roulette's.

572
00:14:00,197 --> 00:14:01,119
I'm gonna clear off the ones we've already eaten.

573
00:14:01,119 --> 00:14:02,924
- Wait Bella, can you actually grab the pickles out

574
00:14:02,924 --> 00:14:04,696
of the fridge, we need those real quick for the next one.

575
00:14:04,696 --> 00:14:06,270
As Collins is clearing out these, (suspenseful music)

576
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,859
why don't you grab that out of the fridge.

577
00:14:07,859 --> 00:14:09,982
There you go and I'll grab- (glass shattering)

578
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:11,024
- [Collins And Devan] Oh!

579
00:14:11,024 --> 00:14:12,774
- [Devan] What! - [Collins] You just broke some sauce!

580
00:14:12,774 --> 00:14:14,053
- [Devan] There we go! (chuckles)

581
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:15,200
- Are you trying to kill me?

582
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,960
- I'm sorry, we had some snakes that were supposed

583
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,403
to pop out and some silly string but I guess it just,

584
00:14:18,403 --> 00:14:21,399
shot out a jar, yeah we should get that cleaned up.

585
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:23,620
Prank backfired, lost our sauce.

586
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,424
Time to choose the next prank food.

587
00:14:25,424 --> 00:14:27,710
Let's do this again, Ava, Bella, Chris, you guys wanna

588
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:28,543
raise a finger.

589
00:14:28,543 --> 00:14:29,376
- [Collins And Devan] Three, two, one, point

590
00:14:29,376 --> 00:14:31,211
- [Devan] Oh my gosh! You went for the- Wow!

591
00:14:31,211 --> 00:14:33,800
- Christian, this time you get to choose which foods

592
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,760
Devan and I have to eat.

593
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,255
So, point to which food's Devan gonna eat.

594
00:14:36,255 --> 00:14:37,859
- Devan's having the chicken wing.

595
00:14:37,859 --> 00:14:38,960
- [Collins] Oooo! - [Devan] All right.

596
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,922
- I think there's one left, it's these lil' cake pops.

597
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:42,290
Again let's start with Devan.

598
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:43,887
Let's start all the way down on that side.

599
00:14:43,887 --> 00:14:45,392
All right Devan, we believe in you.

600
00:14:45,392 --> 00:14:47,465
- [Everyone] Three, two, one.

601
00:14:47,465 --> 00:14:50,688
- Tastes great! I don't think I got pranked!

602
00:14:50,688 --> 00:14:51,812
- All right, Devan got a normal chicken wing .

603
00:14:51,812 --> 00:14:54,140
(cheering)

604
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,550
- [Collins] All right Bella, you're next,

605
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,793
with your chocolate delights.

606
00:14:56,793 --> 00:14:59,053
- Please be a banana, please be a banana.

607
00:14:59,053 --> 00:15:01,604
- Here we go, just a- big bite, big bite.

608
00:15:01,604 --> 00:15:04,937
(encouraging)

609
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:06,158
- [Collins] What is it? That ain't a banana!

610
00:15:06,158 --> 00:15:07,251
(laughing)

611
00:15:07,251 --> 00:15:08,182
- Yeah! (high fives) - Yeah

612
00:15:08,182 --> 00:15:09,015
- No banana!

613
00:15:09,015 --> 00:15:10,588
- Why are your high fives so hard?

614
00:15:10,588 --> 00:15:11,500
- [Collins] What is it?

615
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,422
- [Devan] Is it good?

616
00:15:12,422 --> 00:15:13,630
- It's a cucumber.

617
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:15,846
- Okay, are you not pranked?

618
00:15:15,846 --> 00:15:16,679
- It's really good!

619
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:17,830
- [Christian] Really?

620
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:20,240
- Wait, have we like discovered a new delicious recipe?

621
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,960
All right, so Christian, my man.

622
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,120
- Okay - It's up to you, you got your packaged good.

623
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,270
Your Almond joy. Ta da!

624
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:30,000
- [Devan] Yay! - [Collins] Lovely little- it looks I mean-

625
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,833
- [Bella] It looks promising.

626
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:31,666
- [Collins] It looks promising.

627
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:32,499
- That actually looks pretty real.

628
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:33,625
- I think it looks shady.

629
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:36,190
(laughter)

630
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:37,311
- No!

631
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:38,401
(more laughter)

632
00:15:38,401 --> 00:15:39,341
- [Christian] It's not an Almond Joy!

633
00:15:39,341 --> 00:15:40,326
- All right here we go, three.

634
00:15:40,326 --> 00:15:42,283
- [Everyon] Two, one.

635
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,481
- [Collins] Yup, and then chew it. - [Devan] All right.

636
00:15:44,481 --> 00:15:45,833
What's it taste like? What's it taste like?

637
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:46,666
- [Girls] What is it?

638
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:49,112
- [Christian] Oh my god! Oh my god! (laughter)

639
00:15:49,112 --> 00:15:51,063
- What is it? What is it?

640
00:15:52,629 --> 00:15:54,879
(laughter)

641
00:15:56,418 --> 00:15:59,259
- Would it be like, garlic maybe?

642
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:02,370
- [Collins] It's basically all garlic with a garlic clove

643
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:03,420
instead of the almond.

644
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,396
- [Devan] He's got garlic breath now!

645
00:16:05,396 --> 00:16:06,480
- That's gonna last for about a week.

646
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,562
- I want another Oreo.

647
00:16:07,562 --> 00:16:08,680
(laughter)

648
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,240
- [Collins] So, Ava, next up we have your birthday cake.

649
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,010
- All right, well, I picked something packaged because

650
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:14,252
I thought that maybe a good idea.

651
00:16:14,252 --> 00:16:16,280
But now, my confidence is taken.

652
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,380
- [Collins] Wait did you take another bite of the cucumber?

653
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,320
- Yes.

654
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,410
- Being all sneaky over there.

655
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:22,090
- [Devan] Are you- Wow! - What is wrong with you?

656
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:22,923
- All right Ava, we believe in you,

657
00:16:22,923 --> 00:16:26,711
just go for it, take a big bite, go for it.

658
00:16:26,711 --> 00:16:27,544
Is it workin'?

659
00:16:27,544 --> 00:16:28,377
- [Devan] Oh, what do you taste?

660
00:16:28,377 --> 00:16:30,268
- It's a sponge! - It's a sponge!

661
00:16:30,268 --> 00:16:32,897
(laughter)

662
00:16:32,897 --> 00:16:34,032
- That's not even food!

663
00:16:34,032 --> 00:16:38,340
- I just, like, pushed chocolate up into my gums (mumbles)

664
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,939
- She's like what is this substance?

665
00:16:39,939 --> 00:16:42,930
- [Collins] Okay so now it's time for my final prank food.

666
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:44,624
These lil' cake pops. - [Devan] Yup.

667
00:16:44,624 --> 00:16:46,430
- I'm looking at Devan, I'm trying to like sus' him out,

668
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:47,290
like he might've added this in like

669
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:48,158
an extra little prank one.

670
00:16:48,158 --> 00:16:49,373
- Who knows man, who knows?

671
00:16:49,373 --> 00:16:51,940
- [Everyone] Three, two, one.

672
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,530
- [Devan] Whoa! That was all of it.

673
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:57,290
- Oh yeah! (disappointed responses)

674
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:58,980
- Dude, I can't believe you got the normal one.

675
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:02,297
- Hey man, in my defense, they choose the foods I got to eat

676
00:17:02,297 --> 00:17:03,360
so, not my fault.

677
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,680
- That makes it even worse.

678
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,627
- All right, so those are the prank food roulette's

679
00:17:05,627 --> 00:17:07,392
but we still have one more prank room,

680
00:17:07,392 --> 00:17:09,900
with a crazy big prank that we're gonna end it all with.

681
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,410
Gonna hop out right now. Yeah, let's do it.

682
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:14,740
So over here, this is the last area we're going to be doing

683
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,810
pranks, but there's a twist for this one.

684
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:18,045
Instead, us pulling pranks on you guys,

685
00:17:18,045 --> 00:17:20,257
you guys actually get to pull a prank on us.

686
00:17:20,257 --> 00:17:22,030
(excited) - Yes, finally! - [Collins] Yes, exactly!

687
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:23,740
Okay so, here's the only twist though,

688
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,130
you gotta open up the trash can.

689
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:26,340
- Oh come on!

690
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:28,701
- So trust me, no more pranks, just a trash can.

691
00:17:28,701 --> 00:17:29,759
- Nothing suspicious!

692
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:31,215
(commotion)

693
00:17:31,215 --> 00:17:32,712
- What could go wrong, it's just a trash can?

694
00:17:32,712 --> 00:17:33,545
- Do it.

695
00:17:33,545 --> 00:17:35,004
- Yeah, if you guys wanna get closer to the trash can.

696
00:17:35,004 --> 00:17:35,971
- Yeah, yeah, just get a lot- Yeah.

697
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:38,530
- Just ah, we're just gonna chill back here.

698
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:40,410
If you just wanna just- - [Devan] Tell us what's inside.

699
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:41,243
- [Collins] Yeah, yeah, yeah,

700
00:17:41,243 --> 00:17:42,076
just tell us what's inside the trash can.

701
00:17:42,076 --> 00:17:44,093
(suspenseful music)

702
00:17:44,093 --> 00:17:45,500
- There's nothing in it.

703
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,960
(screams)

704
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,950
- Time for us to make our final DIY prank and

705
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,760
this is the ultimate slime dump.

706
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,150
I'm making a jiggly water slime.

707
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:54,460
- [Devan] And I'm making a Fanta slime.

708
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,655
- [Collins] We're just gonna add some food coloring

709
00:17:55,655 --> 00:17:58,080
like that, yo! Dude, the little like droplets kinda like,

710
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,554
skidded out on all of it bro.

711
00:17:59,554 --> 00:18:00,768
All right, time to mix in the coloring.

712
00:18:00,768 --> 00:18:01,601
So, here we go, just gonna go, ooh! Dude!

713
00:18:01,601 --> 00:18:03,470
Its little like cyclone!

714
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:05,840
- And I added all the glue so now I'm adding the activator.

715
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,880
- Your moving along quickly.

716
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,710
- I sure am. Its almost like I've made slime before.

717
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:11,460
If you could just leave it like that, that would be awesome.

718
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,293
- Oh, like an ombre effect.

719
00:18:12,293 --> 00:18:13,567
- Yeah, exac- What? I don't know.

720
00:18:13,567 --> 00:18:15,270
Its got a little marbling in there too.

721
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,160
- Oooo, look at all these art words!

722
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,020
All right, so next up to make my slime,

723
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,772
I gotta add some activator! Oop! I almost spilled it all.

724
00:18:20,772 --> 00:18:21,870
(words drown out each others)

725
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,275
- Here's the activator for you, yes.

726
00:18:23,275 --> 00:18:24,897
- Awesome man. So, here we go-

727
00:18:24,897 --> 00:18:27,480
- Whoa! - What! Come on! - Yes!

728
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,440
- How many of these things have we hidden around the house?

729
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,273
- A lot.

730
00:18:30,273 --> 00:18:32,040
- This has become the staple prank of this video, man.

731
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,680
Like snack attack. They're everywhere.

732
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,525
I don't wanna open that one.

733
00:18:34,525 --> 00:18:36,530
- Why it's just activator. - Are you kidding me?

734
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:39,330
W-why? Why would I possibly not wanna open that one?

735
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:41,400
I have no idea! Forget it dog!

736
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,600
- It's for you. (sighs)

737
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,551
- Unfortunately, to make my slime I need activator.

738
00:18:44,551 --> 00:18:46,359
- [Both] Three, two, one.

739
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:48,440
- Oh. What. - Oh aye, okay.

740
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,273
- There you go!

741
00:18:49,273 --> 00:18:50,160
- High five!

742
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:50,993
(zapping)

743
00:18:50,993 --> 00:18:51,826
- There we go, whoa. - Oh whoa.

744
00:18:51,826 --> 00:18:54,280
- Secret ice cube. My hands they're electric.

745
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,870
- Is the rest of you- (zaps)

746
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:56,707
- Yeah, it's pretty much all of it.

747
00:18:56,707 --> 00:18:58,776
Mind as well pour over the top, here we go.

748
00:18:58,776 --> 00:19:01,380
(singing) - Bleh!

749
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,370
- Well I gotta dd some floam beads next so.

750
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:04,203
- Some what?

751
00:19:04,203 --> 00:19:05,870
- Some floam ble- beads.

752
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:10,190
- [Both] Three, two, one. (pop) Oh! (exclaiming)

753
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,160
- [Collins] Are you kidding me? It got in mine!

754
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,530
I think these should be rebranded man, floam beads, uh uh,

755
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:17,510
wack beads! Wha wackness, dem beads, they wack!

756
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:19,390
- You just offended all the people who love floam beads.

757
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:20,460
- Yeah, well I don't like them.

758
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,940
- You don't want that army attacking you.

759
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,430
- I am so sorry to the floam bead community,

760
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,850
I didn't mean to upset you at all.

761
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:26,120
Floam beads are indeed legit,

762
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,677
but I feel like they're wack. I stand by sa-

763
00:19:28,677 --> 00:19:30,310
- More floam beads!

764
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,570
- Yeah well you got more floam beads,

765
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,791
I got a balloon over here. Pranks on you!

766
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:35,943
- Whoa! (both screaming)

767
00:19:35,943 --> 00:19:38,820
- Are you kidding me? That is all over the floor!

768
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:39,866
- Yeah. - Dude, we gotta clean this up.

769
00:19:39,866 --> 00:19:40,699
(panicking)

770
00:19:40,699 --> 00:19:42,183
The last time this happened, it stained the floor,

771
00:19:42,183 --> 00:19:45,130
we gotta get this up! Okay! Agh!

772
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:46,454
- Oh my gosh! Oh boy!

773
00:19:46,454 --> 00:19:47,473
This is not good!

774
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:49,800
- [Collins] We're probably gonna need some help.

775
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,000
- [Devan] My socks are wet!

776
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,833
- [Collins] Paper towls!

777
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:52,666
- [Devan] I know!

778
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:53,499
(elevator music)

779
00:19:53,499 --> 00:19:54,510
- That was close.

780
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:55,550
- All that cleaning has got me a

781
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:56,383
little bit thirsty, dude so.

782
00:19:56,383 --> 00:19:58,570
- Okay, yeah, okay wait. - Gonna grab a drink real quick.

783
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:01,310
- All right, you wanna take a swig of- Yes! Yes!

784
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:03,300
Boom, soy sauce. -Mmm!

785
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,233
- Yep! It's soy sauce also added in a

786
00:20:04,233 --> 00:20:05,870
little bit of Canada Dry

787
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:08,210
as well for the carbonation so, how's it taste?

788
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:09,140
- Nope, he doesn't like.

789
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,920
- That was so salty and savory.

790
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,971
I feel like I need somethings sweet to eat now, so.

791
00:20:12,971 --> 00:20:15,160
- I gotchu. Zebra cakes! - Really?

792
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,980
- [Collins] It's like raining Orbeez from above.

793
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,813
- [Devan] Those are really cool.

794
00:20:17,813 --> 00:20:18,646
- [Collins] Yeah so, we got that.

795
00:20:18,646 --> 00:20:20,389
You know, we'll add some rubber duckies in here as well.

796
00:20:20,389 --> 00:20:22,860
So go, ya! Yeet! Okay, there we go.

797
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,510
- This looks okay.

798
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:25,716
- [Collins] Time for me to start mixing up my slime.

799
00:20:25,716 --> 00:20:27,780
It looks like rubber duckies in the tub.

800
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,944
- The package seems to be untampered with.

801
00:20:29,944 --> 00:20:32,290
- Yeah, but they're normal zebra cakes, okay, just enjoy-

802
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:34,050
- Testing the buoyancy. Three, two, one.

803
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:36,010
- You don't have to three, two, one

804
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:36,843
your own zebra cake bite.

805
00:20:36,843 --> 00:20:39,697
- Oh! - Good right. - Wait, agh!

806
00:20:40,778 --> 00:20:41,611
(screams)

807
00:20:41,611 --> 00:20:42,444
- It's a spider!

808
00:20:42,444 --> 00:20:44,410
- Oh! No! (laughs)

809
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,910
- What? - No! - What it's just a spider.

810
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:48,457
- No! How'd you hid a spider in my zebra cakes.

811
00:20:48,457 --> 00:20:51,647
- It was hard. - I didn't appreciate the jiggle towards me.

812
00:20:51,647 --> 00:20:53,393
I don't like that I do not like that.

813
00:20:53,393 --> 00:20:55,530
- All right, the slime is all ready for the

814
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:57,791
ultimate slime dump prank. (sneeze) Bless you Devan.

815
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:00,450
- Ah, thank you. And I got the contraption right here,

816
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,610

817
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:03,443

00:21:03,443 --> 00:21:04,770
so I'm gonna pick up my slime like this, you ready?

819

- Yup, yup, yup, go for it, go for it.

820
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:08,405
- Three, two, one. Yo! - Whoa!

00:21:08,405 --> 00:21:10,407
There you go. - There we go, slimes going in.

822
00:21:10,407 --> 00:21:11,610
- How're your arms doing?

823
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:12,520
- Not too good!

824
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,639
- And I think we're gonna need to make a lot more slime so,

825
00:21:14,639 --> 00:21:15,472
let's get too it.

826
00:21:15,472 --> 00:21:16,755
- So, this the first batch of it so, there we go.

827
00:21:16,755 --> 00:21:17,730

829
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:21,890
and it's time for the ultimate slime dump prank.

830
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:23,563
So right now, let's go.

831
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:26,212
(screams)

832
00:21:26,212 --> 00:21:29,474
- Oh my god! - Yes! -Yes! -Again?

833
00:21:29,474 --> 00:21:31,018
- Good job! (laughter)

834
00:21:31,018 --> 00:21:32,773
- See you later!

835
00:21:32,773 --> 00:21:37,102
- All right, thank you Con- the doors. (stumbles)

836
00:21:37,102 --> 00:21:37,935
Yeah, that way.

837
00:21:37,935 --> 00:21:39,240
(everyone says goodbye to Conrad)

838
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,450
- [Collins] That was the last prank I promise.

839
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:41,283
- [Devan] The last, last.

840
00:21:41,283 --> 00:21:42,756
- You said that five minutes ago!

841
00:21:42,756 --> 00:21:45,410
- This now is the official last prank,

842
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:46,243
you guys get to pull on us.

843
00:21:46,243 --> 00:21:48,130
Basically, you get to dump us in a whole bunch of slime.

844
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:49,830
We've been kinda been pulling pranks on you this whole time.

845
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:50,663
We feel kinda bad and so,

846
00:21:50,663 --> 00:21:52,670
it's time for you guys to get your revenge on us.

847
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:53,503
Yeah, please go easy on us.

848
00:21:53,503 --> 00:21:54,967

All right, so the time has come for the final pranks.

851
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,377
Are you guys ready to get us back?

852
00:22:01,377 --> 00:22:02,546
- [Ava. Bella, And Christian] Yes!

853
00:22:02,546 --> 00:22:04,510
- You guys seem way too excited about this. - I know.

854
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:06,010
- Way too excited. As you guys have seen,

855
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:07,920
we made some slime contraptions, pretty awesome.

856
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,917
So, you guys get to pull the rope and dump the slime so.

857
00:22:09,917 --> 00:22:11,360

858
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,619
- Ava, if you wanna take the rope for me.

859
00:22:12,619 --> 00:22:15,170
- We're gonna stand in the middle you guys stand over there.

860
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:16,280
- Stand directly underneath it.

861
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,650
- Don't pull it! Don't pull it, don't pull it.

862
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:18,483
- No false pulls.

863
00:22:18,483 --> 00:22:19,855
