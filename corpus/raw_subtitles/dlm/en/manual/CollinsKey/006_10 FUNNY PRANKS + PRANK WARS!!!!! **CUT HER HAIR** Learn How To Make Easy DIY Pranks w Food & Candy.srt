1
00:00:00,018 --> 00:00:01,888
(screaming)

2
00:00:01,888 --> 00:00:03,440
- Hmm, I'm thirsty.

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,448
(record scratch)

4
00:00:04,448 --> 00:00:05,281
Mm.

5
00:00:05,281 --> 00:00:07,443
- Wengie! That's Windex, you can't just drink Windex!

6
00:00:07,443 --> 00:00:08,299
- It tastes really good!

7
00:00:08,299 --> 00:00:09,132
- Really?

8
00:00:09,132 --> 00:00:09,965
- Yeah.

9
00:00:09,965 --> 00:00:10,798
- Alright.

10
00:00:10,798 --> 00:00:11,631
- No!

11
00:00:11,631 --> 00:00:12,464
(screaming)

12
00:00:12,464 --> 00:00:13,381
- It burns!

13
00:00:16,655 --> 00:00:17,488
(T.V. beep)

14
00:00:17,488 --> 00:00:18,321
- What just happened here?

15
00:00:18,321 --> 00:00:21,371
- Well, my bottle wasn't actually Windex, it was Gatorade.

16
00:00:21,371 --> 00:00:22,214
- Oh.

17
00:00:22,214 --> 00:00:23,239
- Oh!

18
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:24,072
- Oh yeah.

19
00:00:24,072 --> 00:00:24,905
- Tastes good right?

20
00:00:24,905 --> 00:00:25,738
- Oh yeah. That's nice.

21
00:00:25,738 --> 00:00:26,675
- Pranks, guys.

22
00:00:26,675 --> 00:00:27,508
(laughing)

23
00:00:27,508 --> 00:00:28,802
- The next prank is extra spicy.

24
00:00:28,802 --> 00:00:30,744
Basically, whenever someone asks you for a piece of gum,

25
00:00:30,744 --> 00:00:33,248
this is the perfect prank to pull on them,

26
00:00:33,248 --> 00:00:35,873
and no one will ever ask you for your gum anymore.

27
00:00:35,873 --> 00:00:37,425
'Cuz basically, this prank involves

28
00:00:37,425 --> 00:00:38,258
- Wasabi!

29
00:00:39,176 --> 00:00:40,592
- And trust me, it's spicy!

30
00:00:40,592 --> 00:00:41,425
- Let's do it.

31
00:00:41,425 --> 00:00:42,258
- Let's do it.

32
00:00:42,258 --> 00:00:43,960
Alright, so we're going to open up the package of gum first.

33
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,057
- And I'm gonna open up the wasabi so we can get it ready.

34
00:00:47,057 --> 00:00:48,768
You know what? We should do something.

35
00:00:48,768 --> 00:00:49,601
- What?

36
00:00:49,601 --> 00:00:50,720
- Loser eats wasabi.

37
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,200
- Oh! Like a rock, paper, scissors at the end of the video,

38
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,274
the ultimate showdown, what are you doing there, fam?

39
00:00:56,274 --> 00:00:59,217
We'll find out who has to eat wasabi at the end of the video

40
00:00:59,217 --> 00:01:00,050
that's a great idea.

41
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:01,910
- A full tablespoon.

42
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:02,743
- What?

43
00:01:02,743 --> 00:01:04,168
- Yep.

44
00:01:04,168 --> 00:01:05,001
(sniffing)

45
00:01:05,001 --> 00:01:05,834
- Oh...

46
00:01:06,685 --> 00:01:08,141
- Oh my gosh, it burned my nose hairs.

47
00:01:08,141 --> 00:01:09,621
(groaning)

48
00:01:09,621 --> 00:01:10,973
- It's so bad, oh my gosh.

49
00:01:10,973 --> 00:01:13,884
- I never thought smelling it would make it just hurt.

50
00:01:13,884 --> 00:01:15,100
- Like, I felt the burn.

51
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,252
You just, smell it through your nostrils, man.

52
00:01:17,252 --> 00:01:18,900
My nose hairs are singed.

53
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,604
So guys, basically you're going to take your wasabi,

54
00:01:20,604 --> 00:01:23,920
and you're gonna kind of put it on the top. Oh!

55
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,561
- This looks like a green worm booger.

56
00:01:26,561 --> 00:01:28,864
- Oh, that's kind of nasty in it of itself.

57
00:01:28,864 --> 00:01:31,256
- It's like sticking to my knife.

58
00:01:31,256 --> 00:01:32,968
- Oh yeah. This thing is like very pasty.

59
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:35,065
- They're not going to notice this when they open it?

60
00:01:35,065 --> 00:01:37,656
Like, are we gonna give it to them a certain way?

61
00:01:37,656 --> 00:01:40,241
- Yeah, you hand it to them upside-down so they can't see it

62
00:01:40,241 --> 00:01:42,544
and then they bite into it and they just,

63
00:01:42,544 --> 00:01:44,403
it will mess them up for life.

64
00:01:44,403 --> 00:01:45,291
- Oh.

65
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:46,816
- Oh my gosh, I am not excited about eating some wasabi.

66
00:01:46,816 --> 00:01:48,671
That's something I'm not looking forward to.

67
00:01:48,671 --> 00:01:50,583
Next step's, once you got a spread on there,

68
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:52,967
you're going to take it, put it in the freezer,

69
00:01:52,967 --> 00:01:54,759
let it freeze or dry or harden,

70
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:56,247
and then you scrape off the excess

71
00:01:56,247 --> 00:01:57,673
and then you won't even be able to tell

72
00:01:57,673 --> 00:01:59,687
there's wasabi on the gum.

73
00:01:59,687 --> 00:02:01,567
- That's really smart. I didn't expect that.

74
00:02:01,567 --> 00:02:03,679
- After it's frozen, this is what it looks like.

75
00:02:03,679 --> 00:02:05,519
You're now ready to hand this to someone,

76
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:07,607
and they're gonna take a bite of it and freak out.

77
00:02:07,607 --> 00:02:08,655
Right now I think it's time for me

78
00:02:08,655 --> 00:02:09,999
to actually taste what this is like

79
00:02:09,999 --> 00:02:11,943
before we go for the full tablespoon

80
00:02:11,943 --> 00:02:13,551
of wasabi at the end of the video.

81
00:02:13,551 --> 00:02:15,719
Oh my gosh, I'm not excited about this.

82
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,295
- You know what, that looks so real guys.

83
00:02:17,295 --> 00:02:18,750
It's literally quite real.

84
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:23,137
- Uh-huh. Here we go. Okay. Three, two, one.

85
00:02:23,137 --> 00:02:24,649
Wait, wait, first I'm gonna challenge,

86
00:02:24,649 --> 00:02:26,738
I wanna see if you can subscribe to this channel,

87
00:02:26,738 --> 00:02:28,539
turn on the channel post notifications

88
00:02:28,539 --> 00:02:31,297
and give this video a thumbs up in seven seconds.

89
00:02:31,297 --> 00:02:32,130
You got this? Here we go.

90
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,963
Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Done!

91
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:40,150
If you can do that, comment down below "Keyper Squad"

92
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:42,654
right now. And now? Time to take a bite. Oh my Gosh.

93
00:02:42,654 --> 00:02:44,679
I don't like wasabi at all.

94
00:02:44,679 --> 00:02:48,426
- Alright. Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!

95
00:02:48,426 --> 00:02:49,763
- Oh my gosh!

96
00:02:49,763 --> 00:02:50,682
(screaming)

97
00:02:50,682 --> 00:02:51,578
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

98
00:02:51,578 --> 00:02:52,970
- Oh!

99
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:55,490
- Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

100
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:57,868
- Oh my gosh, if I lose at the end I am not going to be good

101
00:02:57,868 --> 00:03:00,586
because I do not like this, it is so hot! Oh my gosh!

102
00:03:00,586 --> 00:03:02,083
Alright guys, onto the next prank!

103
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:05,226
My mouth is on fire! Oh my gosh, it's so hot.

104
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:08,066
- You're red. You're literally red, it's crazy.

105
00:03:08,066 --> 00:03:09,410
- Yeah. I don't do well with spicy things. At all.

106
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,386
Okay, next round. Let's go. Whoo!

107
00:03:11,386 --> 00:03:13,338
For this next prank, basically we are going--

108
00:03:13,338 --> 00:03:14,171
- Collins?

109
00:03:14,171 --> 00:03:15,004
- What?

110
00:03:15,004 --> 00:03:15,837
- You kind of smell.

111
00:03:15,837 --> 00:03:17,504
- I smell? Oh, okay.

112
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,393
- What?

113
00:03:19,393 --> 00:03:21,827
- It's just cream cheese. And it's super frozen.

114
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:23,293
I did not think it would be that frozen.

115
00:03:23,293 --> 00:03:25,298
(Collins laughs)

116
00:03:25,298 --> 00:03:26,923
So guys this prank here--

117
00:03:26,923 --> 00:03:27,809
- Ew, this smells too!

118
00:03:27,809 --> 00:03:31,861
- That was so gross! Everything about this is disgusting.

119
00:03:31,861 --> 00:03:33,797
Okay guys, now we're going to show you how to make this.

120
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:35,290
(laughing)

121
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,123
(T.V. beep)

122
00:03:36,123 --> 00:03:37,536
Well, that was a bad experience.

123
00:03:37,536 --> 00:03:38,752
But we're going to show you how to make this

124
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:40,871
so you can freak everyone out. So, we got some deodorant?

125
00:03:40,871 --> 00:03:42,079
- We've got one deodorant.

126
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,975
- Oh, we have to share? Ow! Okay.

127
00:03:43,975 --> 00:03:45,257
Oh jeeze, there's two layers.

128
00:03:45,257 --> 00:03:46,273
- Oh yeah, there's the--

129
00:03:46,273 --> 00:03:47,106
(spitting cap out)

130
00:03:47,106 --> 00:03:47,939
- How do you get it out?

131
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:50,446
- Oh, you've got to turn it.

132
00:03:50,446 --> 00:03:51,611
- Oh, three, two, one.

133
00:03:51,611 --> 00:03:52,540
(clinking of plate)

134
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,971
(laughing)

135
00:03:53,971 --> 00:03:54,804
- That didn't work.

136
00:03:54,804 --> 00:03:56,483
- Yeah, nope you've gotta keep going!

137
00:03:56,483 --> 00:03:57,587
(clinking of plate)

138
00:03:57,587 --> 00:03:59,219
Totally meant to do that. All part of the--

139
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:02,625
it's on the floor! Whoa! This thing is slippery, man.

140
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:03,849
Alright, so where are we gonna pop this?

141
00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:05,481
I'm just gonna stand it up right there on top of that.

142
00:04:05,481 --> 00:04:06,801
- I'm still going, I'm still going.

143
00:04:06,801 --> 00:04:08,354
- Let's see if we can grab it and pull it out.

144
00:04:08,354 --> 00:04:11,023
Oh, no! My fingers are all slippery.

145
00:04:11,023 --> 00:04:12,831
Here, I've got an idea. It's called the two spoon approach.

146
00:04:12,831 --> 00:04:14,167
You just kind of clip it and spoon em!

147
00:04:14,167 --> 00:04:17,208
- Whoa! Like, literally that worked guys, look at this.

148
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:18,327
- Yeah but now it's all over me.

149
00:04:18,327 --> 00:04:19,847
So, next step here, we're gonna kind of clean out

150
00:04:19,847 --> 00:04:20,776
the top of it thoroughly,

151
00:04:20,776 --> 00:04:22,711
because you do not want any deodorant left in there.

152
00:04:22,711 --> 00:04:23,544
(magical tinkling)

153
00:04:23,544 --> 00:04:24,377
Done! We've cleaned it out,

154
00:04:24,377 --> 00:04:25,935
and now time to add the cream cheese

155
00:04:25,935 --> 00:04:27,967
and make it look like deodorant.

156
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:28,871
- It's a little bit soggy.

157
00:04:28,871 --> 00:04:30,031
- Yeah, mine's a little soggy.

158
00:04:30,031 --> 00:04:31,929
I wonder if you push it from the bottom like this, Oh!

159
00:04:31,929 --> 00:04:32,762
- Whoah!

160
00:04:32,762 --> 00:04:33,595
- It's like a popsicle. Hey guys,

161
00:04:33,595 --> 00:04:34,428
I've got a cream cheese thumb!

162
00:04:34,428 --> 00:04:35,261
(sqwawking)

163
00:04:35,261 --> 00:04:38,322
So you kind of take off a layer off the top of it.

164
00:04:38,322 --> 00:04:39,155
- Okay.

165
00:04:39,155 --> 00:04:39,988
- Like this, and then you're just gonna start kind of

166
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,907
spooning it into the deodorant.

167
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:43,003
- I see where you're going.

168
00:04:43,003 --> 00:04:43,836
- Alright. So we're just kind of

169
00:04:43,836 --> 00:04:44,669
gonna push this down in here.

170
00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:46,124
- So I'm gonna do it much cleaner.

171
00:04:46,124 --> 00:04:47,787
I'm gonna just stamp it like this.

172
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,764
- Oh, that's really smart.

173
00:04:49,764 --> 00:04:51,483
- It's in a nice blocky shape.

174
00:04:51,483 --> 00:04:52,859
- Just gonna kind of stuff this, oh yeah.

175
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:55,324
This is, I'm getting saucy with mine. Oh yeah, this is nice.

176
00:04:55,324 --> 00:04:57,931
- I love how you're looking at it like it's a piece of art.

177
00:04:57,931 --> 00:05:01,257
Like sculpture. He's just like, like totally, mmm.

178
00:05:01,257 --> 00:05:03,679
- Oh yeah, I'm crafting a masterpiece right now.

179
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:05,327
- This is the masterpiece. Look how smooth that is.

180
00:05:05,327 --> 00:05:07,679
- Yeah, yeah. That is pretty much a masterpiece.

181
00:05:07,679 --> 00:05:10,535
- I'm just glad you're not like using the tongue technique

182
00:05:10,535 --> 00:05:13,921
where you're just actually like, eating it.

183
00:05:13,921 --> 00:05:14,754
Oh, I shouldn't have said that.

184
00:05:14,754 --> 00:05:16,001
Alright, well mine's looking good.

185
00:05:16,001 --> 00:05:17,786
This is really convincing guys.

186
00:05:17,786 --> 00:05:19,201
I would fall for this.

187
00:05:19,201 --> 00:05:20,395
- Mmhm. And there you have it!

188
00:05:20,395 --> 00:05:22,182
Now you can either put this in the freezer

189
00:05:22,182 --> 00:05:23,297
if you want to keep it in this shape,

190
00:05:23,297 --> 00:05:25,298
or if it's cold enough it will just stay like this.

191
00:05:25,298 --> 00:05:26,682
And now you can freak someone out and be like,

192
00:05:26,682 --> 00:05:28,338
oh you want some deodorant? Hold on for a sec.

193
00:05:28,338 --> 00:05:29,257
(bite)

194
00:05:29,257 --> 00:05:30,090
Mm.

195
00:05:31,173 --> 00:05:32,006
(bite)

196
00:05:32,006 --> 00:05:32,839
- It's literally weird even though--

197
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:33,755
- It looks so weird.

198
00:05:33,755 --> 00:05:34,588
- It looks so weird.

199
00:05:34,588 --> 00:05:36,267
I've seen it before and it still looks weird.

200
00:05:36,267 --> 00:05:38,827
- Alright Wengie, we've got some orange juice for you.

201
00:05:38,827 --> 00:05:41,268
- What? That don't look the same as my orange juice.

202
00:05:41,268 --> 00:05:43,476
- Oh no, trust me, they're exactly the same.

203
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:44,759
Yeah. Just enjoy.

204
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:45,592
- Ew!

205
00:05:45,592 --> 00:05:46,425
(laughing)

206
00:05:46,425 --> 00:05:48,816
- Yo! It's macaroni and cheese!

207
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:49,649
(laughing)

208
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:51,479
Oh my gosh, okay yeah. So this one is actually kind of,

209
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:53,231
kind of disastrous because they think they're going

210
00:05:53,231 --> 00:05:55,095
for orange juice when in fact it's only

211
00:05:55,095 --> 00:05:57,430
macaroni and cheese cheese packets.

212
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:00,366
- Ew! That was disgusting!

213
00:06:00,366 --> 00:06:02,064
- So all you do for this one is just take some

214
00:06:02,064 --> 00:06:03,838
orange juice and just empty it out.

215
00:06:03,838 --> 00:06:07,469
Oh, I hope it doesn't go everywhere, how do I open this?

216
00:06:07,469 --> 00:06:08,516
- What are you doing?

217
00:06:08,516 --> 00:06:09,644
- So I'll give you the honors on this one.

218
00:06:09,644 --> 00:06:13,017
If you wanna dunk the packet of macaroni and cheese in there

219
00:06:13,017 --> 00:06:15,409
yo, it's kind of like, it's kind of chunky, right?

220
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:18,058
- It's so orange! We don't have this orange cheese

221
00:06:18,058 --> 00:06:20,793
in Australia! I've never seen cheese so orange you guys.

222
00:06:20,793 --> 00:06:23,481
- America, with the orangest of cheeses. Ha ha!

223
00:06:23,481 --> 00:06:24,873
Let's see if we can, oh.

224
00:06:24,873 --> 00:06:25,825
- Ooh!

225
00:06:25,825 --> 00:06:26,833
- What a perfect pour.

226
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:27,858
- [Wengie] That's really good.

227
00:06:27,858 --> 00:06:29,947
- [Collins] Yo, this actually looks really good.

228
00:06:29,947 --> 00:06:31,225
- That looks like orange juice.

229
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:33,329
- [Collins] This is the perfect prank for breakfast

230
00:06:33,329 --> 00:06:34,729
when you guys are all eating food together.

231
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:36,705
Because everyone thinks they're going for the orange juice.

232
00:06:36,705 --> 00:06:38,252
- You could totally prepare it in the kitchen

233
00:06:38,252 --> 00:06:40,377
and put one orange juice that's like pranked,

234
00:06:40,377 --> 00:06:43,009
and you put normal orange juice for your own.

235
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:43,945
- And then voila!

236
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,025
I can't believe how much it looks like orange juice!

237
00:06:46,025 --> 00:06:46,858
- I can't tell.

238
00:06:46,858 --> 00:06:50,114
- Yo! Check out what I found! These were in the fridge.

239
00:06:50,114 --> 00:06:51,826
- Yeah, I made them earlier can I have this one.

240
00:06:51,826 --> 00:06:53,346
- Yeah, for sure, what are they?

241
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:54,906
- They're caramel covered apples.

242
00:06:54,906 --> 00:06:55,843
- Oh I'm so excited.

243
00:06:55,843 --> 00:06:57,044
- Yeah, alright, cheers!

244
00:06:57,044 --> 00:06:57,877
- Cheers!

245
00:06:57,877 --> 00:06:58,710
- Ah!

246
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:01,069
- Whoa!

247
00:07:01,069 --> 00:07:01,902
(screaming)

248
00:07:01,902 --> 00:07:05,023
What is this, it's an onion?

249
00:07:05,023 --> 00:07:05,856
- Pranked.

250
00:07:05,856 --> 00:07:10,835
- Oh my god. Caramel doesn't taste good with onions.

251
00:07:10,835 --> 00:07:12,607
What the heck is going on?

252
00:07:12,607 --> 00:07:13,745
- Oh that smells so bad!

253
00:07:13,745 --> 00:07:14,578
(screams)

254
00:07:14,578 --> 00:07:15,447
- This was the nastiest thing

255
00:07:15,447 --> 00:07:16,855
I've ever had in my entire life.

256
00:07:16,855 --> 00:07:17,688
And it's so confusing!

257
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:20,327
'Cuz at first you're like, oh, delicious caramel

258
00:07:20,327 --> 00:07:22,103
and then you bite into it and you're like,

259
00:07:22,103 --> 00:07:22,999
oh! Nasty onion.

260
00:07:22,999 --> 00:07:23,991
- Well, mine's an apple.

261
00:07:23,991 --> 00:07:24,879
- So how would you do this?

262
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:27,077
- First, you take a packet of caramel

263
00:07:27,077 --> 00:07:27,910
- Okay.

264
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,260
and you melt it over a pot.

265
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,093
- Mmhm

266
00:07:30,093 --> 00:07:31,583
And then you cover one apple with the caramel

267
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,463
and one onion with caramel.

268
00:07:33,463 --> 00:07:34,296
(groaning)

269
00:07:34,296 --> 00:07:35,775
And then you take it to your friend.

270
00:07:35,775 --> 00:07:36,608
- Okay, gotcha.

271
00:07:36,608 --> 00:07:38,159
So then the friend has no idea what's going on.

272
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:39,559
- It even smells bad from here!

273
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:40,392
(choking)

274
00:07:40,392 --> 00:07:42,943
- This was a diabolical prank to say the least.

275
00:07:42,943 --> 00:07:46,744
This next prank actually involves toothpaste. Yeet!

276
00:07:46,744 --> 00:07:47,903
- Okay, I like this one.

277
00:07:47,903 --> 00:07:49,679
I can't wait til you brush your teeth because

278
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:51,343
that onion though. Yeah. Yeah.

279
00:07:51,343 --> 00:07:53,368
- Yep, it was your prank okay?

280
00:07:53,368 --> 00:07:54,912
You're the one who pranked me on this one.

281
00:07:54,912 --> 00:07:55,745
- No bad idea.

282
00:07:55,745 --> 00:07:57,519
- First steps first, you gonna take your toothpaste,

283
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,578
you gotta empty the entire tube.

284
00:07:59,578 --> 00:08:02,995
- Oh no! I can't keep watching this. Ugh.

285
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:08,248
You can fit a whole tube of toothpaste in your mouth?

286
00:08:08,248 --> 00:08:09,415
I'm impressed.

287
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,591
(laughs)

288
00:08:12,591 --> 00:08:13,831
- See? No more bad breath.

289
00:08:13,831 --> 00:08:15,447
- Alright. Now after you've emptied your tube,

290
00:08:15,447 --> 00:08:16,888
you wanna make sure you do this thoroughly,

291
00:08:16,888 --> 00:08:18,830
I didn't do it thoroughly, we're gonna keep going here.

292
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,663
(T.V. beep)

293
00:08:19,663 --> 00:08:20,496
- That kind of looks like slime,

294
00:08:20,496 --> 00:08:21,329
you could make slime out of that.

295
00:08:21,329 --> 00:08:23,053
- That would be like really cool. Toothpaste slime.

296
00:08:23,053 --> 00:08:23,949
That's the next thing.

297
00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:26,684
Now I'm going to try to inflate my tube.

298
00:08:26,684 --> 00:08:27,517
- Oh!

299
00:08:27,517 --> 00:08:28,350
- And for the next step now,

300
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,932
you're gonna take some mayonnaise,

301
00:08:29,932 --> 00:08:31,340
you're gonna open it up now.

302
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,356
(glass shattering)

303
00:08:32,356 --> 00:08:35,012
Perfect. And I got one of these handy-dandy syringes here.

304
00:08:35,012 --> 00:08:36,438
So we're gonna pop this in.

305
00:08:36,438 --> 00:08:38,108
- [Wengie] Ooh! Ew!

306
00:08:38,108 --> 00:08:41,268
- [Collins] Oh! That's crazy!

307
00:08:41,268 --> 00:08:43,359
- That looks cool. What?

308
00:08:43,359 --> 00:08:45,451
- Oh my gosh. Alright, so now we pop the syringe like this.

309
00:08:45,451 --> 00:08:47,188
Oh! It like literally fits perfectly!

310
00:08:47,188 --> 00:08:48,021
And then we're just gonna...

311
00:08:48,021 --> 00:08:49,771
- [Wengie] Oh!

312
00:08:49,771 --> 00:08:50,604
- Whoa!

313
00:08:52,105 --> 00:08:53,089
(laughing)

314
00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:57,256
- [Wengie] That's satisfying. Whoa! That's perfect.

315
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,232
(screams)

316
00:09:00,232 --> 00:09:02,600
(slow-motion deep voice scream)

317
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,688
(laughs)

318
00:09:03,688 --> 00:09:04,856
Oh my god.

319
00:09:04,856 --> 00:09:06,372
- Are you okay?

320
00:09:06,372 --> 00:09:08,704
- No! I'm covered in mayonnaise.

321
00:09:08,704 --> 00:09:10,199
- Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!

322
00:09:10,199 --> 00:09:11,663
- So that was the real prank.

323
00:09:11,663 --> 00:09:15,606
- Oh my gosh. I'm in so much trouble for this one.

324
00:09:15,606 --> 00:09:17,148
Y'all better go subscribe to her channel

325
00:09:17,148 --> 00:09:19,461
because she just got like, splattered with mayonnaise.

326
00:09:19,461 --> 00:09:20,341
Oh my gosh!

327
00:09:20,341 --> 00:09:21,174
(T.V. beep)

328
00:09:21,174 --> 00:09:22,007
- Alright, I'm all cleaned up.

329
00:09:22,007 --> 00:09:23,196
- I am so sorry, oh wait.

330
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:24,844
You actually still have of mayonnaise still in your hair.

331
00:09:24,844 --> 00:09:28,194
Look forward really quick? Okay, here we go, hold up, um.

332
00:09:28,194 --> 00:09:29,027
(hair clippers buzzing)

333
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:29,860
(screams)

334
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,693
- What!

335
00:09:30,693 --> 00:09:31,526
- It's an app! It's an app!

336
00:09:31,526 --> 00:09:32,632
(screams)

337
00:09:32,632 --> 00:09:34,114
(laughing)

338
00:09:34,114 --> 00:09:36,066
- You guys, that's another fun prank.

339
00:09:36,066 --> 00:09:37,872
There's an app, it's like a razor app.

340
00:09:37,872 --> 00:09:39,569
It sounds like you're about to buzz someone's hair off.

341
00:09:39,569 --> 00:09:40,840
And like her hair is iconic.

342
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,048
- I know! My hair!

343
00:09:43,048 --> 00:09:44,704
- Alright guys, so right now I don't think

344
00:09:44,704 --> 00:09:48,346
we're gonna add anymore mayonnaise for obvious reasons.

345
00:09:48,346 --> 00:09:49,266
(screaming)

346
00:09:49,266 --> 00:09:50,765
But that's basically how the prank ends up

347
00:09:50,765 --> 00:09:52,223
where someone goes to squeeze out their toothpaste,

348
00:09:52,223 --> 00:09:54,381
mayonnaise comes out instead of actual toothpaste.

349
00:09:54,381 --> 00:09:55,391
- [Wengie] Ew!

350
00:09:55,391 --> 00:09:56,614
- It will not leave your teeth clean,

351
00:09:56,614 --> 00:09:58,829
it will leave your breath smelling nasty.

352
00:09:58,829 --> 00:09:59,710
- It don't smell good.

353
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:00,822
- It don't smell good.

354
00:10:00,822 --> 00:10:02,206
And I keep remembering that at the end of this

355
00:10:02,206 --> 00:10:04,838
one of us is going to have to eat a whole thing of wasabi.

356
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:05,671
- Oh no!

357
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:06,958
- We've only got a few pranks left so.

358
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:07,791
- Yes.

359
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:08,870
- I guess, let's see what else we've got in store.

360
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:11,603
- Alright, we've been filming for a while. Are you hungry?

361
00:10:11,603 --> 00:10:12,781
- Yeah I'm actually really hungry.

362
00:10:12,781 --> 00:10:14,245
- Me too. So I've got two things,

363
00:10:14,245 --> 00:10:17,732
this is a chocolate egg, apple. Which one do you want?

364
00:10:17,732 --> 00:10:19,197
- I actually love chocolate eggs

365
00:10:19,197 --> 00:10:20,030
so I'll take this right now.

366
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:23,540
It's like one of my favorite foods.

367
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,373
- Mm.

368
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:27,206
(Wengie laughing)

369
00:10:29,565 --> 00:10:30,527
- What is this?

370
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,149
- It's a chocolate egg, you know it's chocolate--

371
00:10:32,149 --> 00:10:34,397
- Oh, literally a chocolate egg! Okay.

372
00:10:34,397 --> 00:10:36,989
So wait, how do you do this prank? I don't like this one.

373
00:10:36,989 --> 00:10:39,421
- Okay well, there's some chocolate, you basically melt it

374
00:10:39,421 --> 00:10:41,614
and cover a real egg with the chocolate.

375
00:10:41,614 --> 00:10:44,883
- Oh! I saw all the eggs here and I was like,

376
00:10:44,883 --> 00:10:46,232
this is kind of suspicious.

377
00:10:46,232 --> 00:10:47,567
(screaming)

378
00:10:47,567 --> 00:10:48,887
- It burns it burns!

379
00:10:48,887 --> 00:10:50,681
- So we're just gonna unscrew the tops right now,

380
00:10:50,681 --> 00:10:52,504
I've actually got a little bit of left over Windex.

381
00:10:52,504 --> 00:10:55,633
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew! Oh! Whoa!

382
00:10:55,633 --> 00:10:58,359
- I'm kidding. I got nothing.

383
00:10:58,359 --> 00:10:59,637
- Well it's turned off so hold on. Let me just.

384
00:10:59,637 --> 00:11:03,804
- Oh! Safety switch. I like it. It's Wengie proof. Oh!

385
00:11:04,963 --> 00:11:05,880
- Whoa!

386
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,061
(Wengie laughing)

387
00:11:07,061 --> 00:11:11,171
This is like continual pranks, man, I cannot catch a break.

388
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,171
It's a very effective way to remove it.

389
00:11:13,171 --> 00:11:15,043
- Are you serious? Can't you just pour it?

390
00:11:15,043 --> 00:11:16,554
(Collins laughing)

391
00:11:16,554 --> 00:11:17,621
- Yeah.

392
00:11:17,621 --> 00:11:20,011
- What? What are you doing Collins?

393
00:11:20,011 --> 00:11:22,619
- Yeah, no, no that will not work. Oh!

394
00:11:22,619 --> 00:11:23,452
- Whoops.

395
00:11:23,452 --> 00:11:25,043
- Oh jeeze. Well, I guess the benefit

396
00:11:25,043 --> 00:11:27,243
is that if we get this on the glass it's no big deal

397
00:11:27,243 --> 00:11:30,626
because it's a glass cleaner I guess. Ooh!

398
00:11:30,626 --> 00:11:31,828
- Look at that foam.

399
00:11:31,828 --> 00:11:33,358
I was like trying to make it like a bubble bath.

400
00:11:33,358 --> 00:11:35,262
(blowing air through container)

401
00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:37,013
Aw! You made bubbles!

402
00:11:37,013 --> 00:11:38,292
- So make sure you guys get all of it out.

403
00:11:38,292 --> 00:11:39,188
- And wash it.

404
00:11:39,188 --> 00:11:40,717
- Yes. So we're gonna go do that right now,

405
00:11:40,717 --> 00:11:41,550
we'll be right back.

406
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,383
(magic chimes)

407
00:11:42,383 --> 00:11:43,812
And now, you just take a blue colored gatorade

408
00:11:43,812 --> 00:11:46,156
and fill up your bottle of Windex.

409
00:11:46,156 --> 00:11:47,788
- Ooh, this smells really good.

410
00:11:47,788 --> 00:11:48,957
- This would like freak everyone out.

411
00:11:48,957 --> 00:11:50,413
Like especially for like back to school,

412
00:11:50,413 --> 00:11:52,596
even in class, like anywhere, with your friends.

413
00:11:52,596 --> 00:11:54,228
This will like, just trip people out.

414
00:11:54,228 --> 00:11:55,500
- It looks almost similar.

415
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,024
Oh no! It's making my hands slippery!

416
00:11:57,024 --> 00:11:58,196
It's slipping, it's slipping, it's slipping!

417
00:11:58,196 --> 00:11:59,606
- You got it? Oh, okay there we go.

418
00:11:59,606 --> 00:12:01,021
So now we're getting the Gatorade on the table

419
00:12:01,021 --> 00:12:02,660
I don't think the Gatorade is meant to be on the table.

420
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,389
It's not like Windex. Won't clean it the same way.

421
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:06,294
- No, it's gonna get sticky.

422
00:12:06,294 --> 00:12:08,981
Literally, oh, how does that taste?

423
00:12:08,981 --> 00:12:10,204
(coughs)

424
00:12:10,204 --> 00:12:13,004
- Awesome. So whether you're at home, in class, or anywhere

425
00:12:13,004 --> 00:12:14,630
with friends, family, you can then

426
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,416
take your bottle of Windex and do this.

427
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:17,782
- Mmhm.

428
00:12:17,782 --> 00:12:18,889
- Or it can be with the top on,

429
00:12:18,889 --> 00:12:20,143
and you can squirt it into your mouth.

430
00:12:20,143 --> 00:12:20,976
(liquid squirting)

431
00:12:20,976 --> 00:12:21,809
(Collins screams)

432
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:22,642
Oh! Oh my gosh, I

433
00:12:22,642 --> 00:12:23,475
forgot to clean it out!

434
00:12:23,475 --> 00:12:25,396
I forgot to clean the top out! There's Windex left over.

435
00:12:25,396 --> 00:12:26,756
- Oh! Yeah. We forgot that part.

436
00:12:26,756 --> 00:12:30,502
- Alright guys, onto the next round. Holy cow!

437
00:12:30,502 --> 00:12:32,905
- I'm so glad I didn't put mine on.

438
00:12:32,905 --> 00:12:34,667
- This is perfect if you want to prank your siblings.

439
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:37,067
So basically for this prank, grab their bar of soap

440
00:12:37,067 --> 00:12:39,555
you're also gonna need some clear nail polish.

441
00:12:39,555 --> 00:12:40,388
Now you're gonna open it up.

442
00:12:40,388 --> 00:12:42,113
- [Wengie] Alright. Oh.

443
00:12:42,113 --> 00:12:42,946
- How do you...

444
00:12:42,946 --> 00:12:44,402
- That's, oh. I've got it, I've got it.

445
00:12:44,402 --> 00:12:45,673
- Oh there we go. That was difficult.

446
00:12:45,673 --> 00:12:46,723
And what you're gonna do is you're gonna cover it

447
00:12:46,723 --> 00:12:48,555
in clear nail polish.

448
00:12:48,555 --> 00:12:49,698
I've gotta say, I don't think I'll ever

449
00:12:49,698 --> 00:12:51,578
get used to the smell of nail polish.

450
00:12:51,578 --> 00:12:53,849
- No, it's overpowering. I can smell it from here,

451
00:12:53,849 --> 00:12:55,642
and I'm already like trying to move back.

452
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:57,490
- Oh yeah. So once the top side dries,

453
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:59,018
you're gonna take it, you're going to flip it over.

454
00:12:59,018 --> 00:13:00,946
Whoops! And you're going to do the bottom side.

455
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:04,609
That way, when they go to use the soap it will never sud up.

456
00:13:04,609 --> 00:13:06,186
'Cuz the clear nail polish, for some reason,

457
00:13:06,186 --> 00:13:08,265
it stops the water from touching the soap.

458
00:13:08,265 --> 00:13:10,276
So they're going to be washing themselves

459
00:13:10,276 --> 00:13:11,700
thinking they're getting super clean

460
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,533
when they're not at all.

461
00:13:12,533 --> 00:13:13,697
In fact, it is probably going to smell like nail polish

462
00:13:13,697 --> 00:13:14,729
when they're all done with their showers.

463
00:13:14,729 --> 00:13:16,314
And now. I think we can put this down.

464
00:13:16,314 --> 00:13:17,793
Because it's time for the moment

465
00:13:17,793 --> 00:13:19,154
you've all been waiting for.

466
00:13:19,154 --> 00:13:20,745
- Oh!

467
00:13:20,745 --> 00:13:23,006
- The big finale! We've got the wasabi.

468
00:13:23,006 --> 00:13:23,839
- [Wengie] Mmhm.

469
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,861
- And whoever loses this rock, paper, scissors,

470
00:13:25,861 --> 00:13:28,669
is going to eat a giant squirt of it.

471
00:13:28,669 --> 00:13:29,717
You say it differently, right?

472
00:13:29,717 --> 00:13:30,653
Because in Australia you say--

473
00:13:30,653 --> 00:13:31,821
- We would say scissors, paper, rock.

474
00:13:31,821 --> 00:13:32,941
- Scissors, paper, rock, that just feels so weird.

475
00:13:32,941 --> 00:13:34,093
- You guys say rock, paper, scissors, right?

476
00:13:34,093 --> 00:13:35,487
- I'll go, we'll say scissors, paper, rock,

477
00:13:35,487 --> 00:13:36,320
because that's cool.

478
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,153
- Ready?

479
00:13:37,153 --> 00:13:39,440
- Yep. Scissors, paper, rock. Oh!

480
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,273
- Oh no!

481
00:13:41,604 --> 00:13:43,736
- Alright, so now the moment has come, we're about to--

482
00:13:43,736 --> 00:13:46,184
it just shot everywhere! It luckily didn't get on you.

483
00:13:46,184 --> 00:13:48,895

- Yes.

489
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:57,669
- Three, two, one. Oh my gosh!

490
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,911
(screams)

491
00:13:59,911 --> 00:14:03,612
Click here, click here, click here! Ahh!

492
00:14:03,612 --> 00:14:04,908
Alright, bye!

493
00:14:04,908 --> 00:14:06,191
- Bye!

494
00:14:06,191 --> 00:14:07,024
- That was terrible.

495
00:14:07,024 --> 00:14:07,857
(Wengie screams)

496
00:14:07,857 --> 00:14:09,864
Holy cow that was intense.

497
00:14:09,864 --> 00:14:11,322
(Wengie laughs)

498
00:14:11,322 --> 00:14:12,155
- My nose!
