1
00:00:00,743 --> 00:00:03,326
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:19,363 --> 00:00:21,696
(pop music)

3
00:00:27,746 --> 00:00:30,477
(text alert)

4
00:00:30,477 --> 00:00:31,756
- Who is that?

5
00:00:31,756 --> 00:00:32,874
- I don't know.

6
00:00:32,874 --> 00:00:34,957
- Maybe you should check.

7
00:00:35,881 --> 00:00:38,523
(deep sigh)

8
00:00:38,523 --> 00:00:39,356
- Look up.

9
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,277
(text alert)

10
00:00:46,277 --> 00:00:47,777
Back right pocket.

11
00:00:51,099 --> 00:00:51,932
Oh.

12
00:00:51,932 --> 00:00:53,695
- What is that?

13
00:00:53,695 --> 00:00:54,812
(text alert)

14
00:00:54,812 --> 00:00:56,580
- Open door.

15
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:57,913
- Open the door.

16
00:01:05,824 --> 00:01:07,328
- That was lame, dude.

17
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,161
- Yeah.

18
00:01:09,644 --> 00:01:12,894
- Well, I need to go anywhere but here.

19
00:01:16,918 --> 00:01:19,618
- So why aren't you in Malibu?

20
00:01:19,618 --> 00:01:21,445
- Well, I was.

21
00:01:21,445 --> 00:01:22,528
I'm back now.

22
00:01:24,956 --> 00:01:29,623
I've been thinking a lot about what I said, and I mean it.

23
00:01:29,623 --> 00:01:32,559
I want you to be happy and if I thought Eddie was right

24
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:35,892
for you then I wouldn't be standing here

25
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,120
but I don't think he is,

26
00:01:41,693 --> 00:01:42,693
and I think,

27
00:01:47,128 --> 00:01:49,263
maybe I could be.

28
00:01:49,263 --> 00:01:53,714
- So your magical pixel girl didn't work out for you

29
00:01:53,714 --> 00:01:57,046
and I'm like what, your consolation prize?

30
00:01:57,046 --> 00:01:59,223
- No, God, it wasn't that at all.

31
00:01:59,223 --> 00:02:00,056
Okay Leone was great.

32
00:02:00,056 --> 00:02:01,535
She was funny, she was cool.

33
00:02:01,535 --> 00:02:03,223
- Then why aren't you with her right now?

34
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:04,223
- Because...

35
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:06,970
- She what?

36
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:09,588
- You're going to say it's lame.

37
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:11,358
- No I won't.

38
00:02:11,358 --> 00:02:12,191
I promise.

39
00:02:15,767 --> 00:02:17,184
- She wasn't you.

40
00:02:24,098 --> 00:02:26,681
- God, Collins that isn't fair.

41
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:30,416
You had years to tell me that.

42
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:31,249
Years.

43
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:36,767
And now you pick the day I'm moving in with my boyfriend?

44
00:02:36,767 --> 00:02:37,600
- What?

45
00:02:38,543 --> 00:02:42,710
- Yeah, he's been asking, so I decided to give it a shot.

46
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:47,016
Look, I understand that you haven't really gotten along

47
00:02:47,016 --> 00:02:50,599
with him or even liked him, but he loves me

48
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:54,889
and he knew what he wanted.

49
00:02:54,889 --> 00:02:55,722
- What?

50
00:03:02,703 --> 00:03:03,536
Okay.

51
00:03:14,679 --> 00:03:17,012
(pop music)

52
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,251
- What's up baby?

53
00:03:20,251 --> 00:03:21,084
- Hey.

54
00:03:22,542 --> 00:03:24,567
- I wanted to show you this.

55
00:03:24,567 --> 00:03:25,583
- What's up?

56
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:28,094
- Check out this video.

57
00:03:28,094 --> 00:03:29,179
- Oh.

58
00:03:29,179 --> 00:03:30,012
- Yeah.

59
00:03:31,028 --> 00:03:31,861
- Wow.

60
00:03:33,133 --> 00:03:35,754
(laughs)

61
00:03:35,754 --> 00:03:38,261
Okay, I have to go study.

62
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:39,582
- No.

63
00:03:39,582 --> 00:03:40,934
- I know.

64
00:03:40,934 --> 00:03:43,351
Babe, I have a test tomorrow.

65
00:03:47,485 --> 00:03:50,025
(sighs)

66
00:03:50,025 --> 00:03:53,942
- Yeah don't touch that board, I'm gripping it.

67
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,713
(paper rip)

68
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,132
(pop music)

69
00:04:34,297 --> 00:04:35,467
(record beep)

70
00:04:35,467 --> 00:04:37,754
- What's up guys, it's Collins Key and first of all

71
00:04:37,754 --> 00:04:39,024
I know it's late at night right now

72
00:04:39,024 --> 00:04:40,145
but I just had to post this.

73
00:04:40,145 --> 00:04:43,587
I had to get this off my mind and yeah, I am aware

74
00:04:43,587 --> 00:04:45,863
that things have been really crazy on my Youtube channel

75
00:04:45,863 --> 00:04:48,464
for the last few days and there's one more crazy surprise

76
00:04:48,464 --> 00:04:51,725
that I've got for you guys and I'm doing a meet-up in L.A.

77
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:54,051
So first of all, even if you don't live in L.A. I still

78
00:04:54,051 --> 00:04:56,164
have you covered because this is going to be live-streamed

79
00:04:56,164 --> 00:04:57,455
on my Youtube channel.

80
00:04:57,455 --> 00:04:59,580
So, it doesn't matter where in the world you live, everyone

81
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,702
can take part in this, but if you are in L.A.

82
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:02,840
I would love to see you there.

83
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,273
So, I'm going to put all the information

84
00:05:04,273 --> 00:05:05,635
you need to know in the description.

85
00:05:05,635 --> 00:05:07,614
It's happening this weekend.

86
00:05:07,614 --> 00:05:08,946
This weekend.

87
00:05:08,946 --> 00:05:11,141
So again, make sure you guys go check out all those details

88
00:05:11,141 --> 00:05:13,030
and again, we'll be live-streaming it

89
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:15,101
so I've got you covered.

90
00:05:15,101 --> 00:05:16,852
I just wanted to do this to say thank you because you guys

91
00:05:16,852 --> 00:05:18,579
have been with me throughout this entire process

92
00:05:18,579 --> 00:05:20,742
and just showed me so much love and support throughout

93
00:05:20,742 --> 00:05:22,196
this entire thing and I've had a ton of fun.

94
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:25,000
You guys were figuring out so many clues and I don't know,

95
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,178
I feel like we got closer throughout this entire process.

96
00:05:28,178 --> 00:05:31,551
For me, even though things didn't go exactly how I thought

97
00:05:31,551 --> 00:05:35,809
they would, but I think what I've learned is that if you're

98
00:05:35,809 --> 00:05:38,425
brave enough to just take risks

99
00:05:38,425 --> 00:05:42,342
and try out new adventures and new experiences,

100
00:05:44,766 --> 00:05:47,600
they don't need to go how you thought

101
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,767
they would and a lot of times they won't, but that's okay.

102
00:05:53,382 --> 00:05:55,132
That's not the point.

103
00:05:56,154 --> 00:05:59,140
The point is you get to learn about yourself,

104
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:03,729
about who you want to be, and who you want to be with,

105
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:04,792
and I think--

106
00:06:04,792 --> 00:06:07,042
(knocking)

107
00:06:09,674 --> 00:06:10,507
- Hey.

108
00:06:11,969 --> 00:06:13,719
Cool if I study here?

109
00:06:29,587 --> 00:06:31,920
(pop music)

110
00:06:35,418 --> 00:06:36,837
- Uh so yeah, like I said,

111
00:06:36,837 --> 00:06:37,670
(laughs)

112
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:41,753
I'd love to see you guys at the meet-up and yeah.

113
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:45,772
(pop music)
