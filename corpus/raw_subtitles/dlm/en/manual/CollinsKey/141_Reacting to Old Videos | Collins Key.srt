1
00:00:01,386 --> 00:00:02,857
- Whoa!

2
00:00:02,857 --> 00:00:04,588
♫ In the jungle, the mighty

3
00:00:04,588 --> 00:00:05,421
(tone)

4
00:00:05,421 --> 00:00:07,402
What's up, it's Collins Key and welcome to

5
00:00:07,402 --> 00:00:08,235
the Thursday vlog.

6
00:00:08,235 --> 00:00:10,727
Now for today's video, this is a celebration video

7
00:00:10,727 --> 00:00:12,108
because we are literally about to hit

8
00:00:12,108 --> 00:00:15,896
one million subscribers and by the time this video

9
00:00:15,896 --> 00:00:17,357
gets posted, we might have already hit a million

10
00:00:17,357 --> 00:00:18,477
but first of all

11
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:21,737
(makes explosive sound)

12
00:00:21,737 --> 00:00:24,634
Literally mind blown, I remember starting this channel

13
00:00:24,634 --> 00:00:26,727
and going like "If I have a thousand subscribers,

14
00:00:26,727 --> 00:00:28,097
"that would be crazy!"

15
00:00:28,097 --> 00:00:31,152
And we're about to hit a million, so first and foremost

16
00:00:31,152 --> 00:00:32,706
thank you to each and every one of you

17
00:00:32,706 --> 00:00:33,972
who subscribed to the channel.

18
00:00:33,972 --> 00:00:35,868
You guys are my inspiration when it comes to the videos.

19
00:00:35,868 --> 00:00:37,671
If it wasn't for you guys, I wouldn't be doing this.

20
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:39,886
You guys are my everything, so thank you guys so much

21
00:00:39,886 --> 00:00:42,503
for all of your support, this is a huge, huge milestone

22
00:00:42,503 --> 00:00:43,659
for the Keeper family.

23
00:00:43,659 --> 00:00:45,269
And so in honor of one million subscribers,

24
00:00:45,269 --> 00:00:47,211
today I thought it would be kind of fun to take a step back

25
00:00:47,211 --> 00:00:50,348
and re-watch and react to some of my old videos,

26
00:00:50,348 --> 00:00:52,967
some videos that I've never even posted on the internet,

27
00:00:52,967 --> 00:00:54,615
they are that cringe-worthy.

28
00:00:54,615 --> 00:00:55,841
And if you have been subscribed to the channel,

29
00:00:55,841 --> 00:00:58,427
let me know by liking this video and comment down below

30
00:00:58,427 --> 00:01:00,279
at what point did you, my voice just cracked,

31
00:01:00,279 --> 00:01:02,592
at what point did you subscribe to this channel

32
00:01:02,592 --> 00:01:04,922
and also comment just like a fun little fact about yourself

33
00:01:04,922 --> 00:01:06,130
because here is what I want you guys to do.

34
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:08,379
Down in the comments I want you guys to introduce yourself,

35
00:01:08,379 --> 00:01:10,310
I want you to meet a whole bunch of other Keepers

36
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:11,761
and in the comment section, let's have

37
00:01:11,761 --> 00:01:13,701
a Keeper meet-and-greet where you guys just

38
00:01:13,701 --> 00:01:15,123
all meet each other, just talk with each other,

39
00:01:15,123 --> 00:01:17,567
and just get to know one another because this family

40
00:01:17,567 --> 00:01:19,578
is getting huge, but I want to make sure that we all

41
00:01:19,578 --> 00:01:22,896
stay connected and that we really stay close as a family.

42
00:01:22,896 --> 00:01:24,373
So in the comments, if you guys would do that,

43
00:01:24,373 --> 00:01:26,220
that would mean so much to me and I think it would just be

44
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,526
super fun, but without any further ado,

45
00:01:27,526 --> 00:01:30,338
let's jump right in right now and yeah.

46
00:01:30,338 --> 00:01:32,466
Let's react to some old videos.

47
00:01:32,466 --> 00:01:35,382
Look at that little smile, what's going on?

48
00:01:35,382 --> 00:01:37,549
(singing)

49
00:01:45,794 --> 00:01:46,716
(claps)

50
00:01:46,716 --> 00:01:47,604
Good job, little Collins.

51
00:01:47,604 --> 00:01:48,907
I don't know what that was, I don't know what you said,

52
00:01:48,907 --> 00:01:50,342
but good job.

53
00:01:50,342 --> 00:01:51,983
- [Dad] So what do you call this, Pillow Man?

54
00:01:51,983 --> 00:01:54,026
- So we got Pillow Man, apparently.

55
00:01:54,026 --> 00:01:55,168
- [Dad] Pillow Man.

56
00:01:55,168 --> 00:01:58,289
- [Mom] Can I give you a hug?

57
00:01:58,289 --> 00:02:00,175
- Why, why did I even do this?

58
00:02:00,175 --> 00:02:01,989
- [Mom] Oh, a nice cushy hug!

59
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:03,572
That's a cushy hug!

60
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:06,904
Thank you Pillow Man.

61
00:02:06,904 --> 00:02:08,562
(laughs)

62
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:10,870
- I wasn't a superhero, but I was Pillow Man.

63
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,742
Okay so I think we're having like a talent show here

64
00:02:12,742 --> 00:02:14,361
or something apparently on the trampoline.

65
00:02:14,361 --> 00:02:15,861
Oh!

66
00:02:15,861 --> 00:02:18,429
Did y'all just see that doggy into front flip there,

67
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:19,934
that was next level stuff.

68
00:02:19,934 --> 00:02:23,662
Let's see what Devan's got, is Devan gonna hit it?

69
00:02:23,662 --> 00:02:24,893
Incredible.

70
00:02:24,893 --> 00:02:26,066
Before I show you guys these next clips,

71
00:02:26,066 --> 00:02:27,815
I have to preface this and let you guys know

72
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:29,671
what's going on, otherwise, you guys are going to think

73
00:02:29,671 --> 00:02:32,286
that I'm literally the craziest person you've ever seen

74
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:33,241
in your entire life.

75
00:02:33,241 --> 00:02:34,912
I'd just seen the Transformers movie, in the film

76
00:02:34,912 --> 00:02:37,968
there's a little Decepticon robot character named Frenzy

77
00:02:37,968 --> 00:02:39,950
and he was just this crazy little character

78
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:42,412
who would be like spazzing out all the time

79
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:45,019
and so these next videos are my best impression

80
00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:46,210
of that character.

81
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:49,773
So I guess you could say it's Collins being a little actor.

82
00:02:49,773 --> 00:02:50,989
Whoa!

83
00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:53,656
(crazed noises)

84
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:02,002
(laughs)

85
00:03:07,956 --> 00:03:10,039
What am I, I'm so creepy!

86
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:12,442
I'm so weird!

87
00:03:14,052 --> 00:03:16,719
(crazed noises)

88
00:03:18,844 --> 00:03:20,927
(laughs)

89
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:25,871
Why?!

90
00:03:28,361 --> 00:03:31,299
Oh my god, I'm crying right now!

91
00:03:31,299 --> 00:03:33,382
(laughs)

92
00:03:34,734 --> 00:03:35,567
What?!

93
00:03:36,643 --> 00:03:39,152
Someone please explain me to me!

94
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:40,237
That was a cool fort though.

95
00:03:40,237 --> 00:03:42,904
(crazed noises)

96
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,259
(laughs)

97
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:50,176
Oh my gosh!

98
00:03:54,851 --> 00:03:58,880
♫ In the jungle, the mighty jungle, the lion--

99
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,257
I'm low-key nervous, what is this?

100
00:04:01,257 --> 00:04:02,090
No!

101
00:04:04,042 --> 00:04:04,875
No, no!

102
00:04:06,544 --> 00:04:08,860
No, make it stop, no!

103
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,744
What is this?

104
00:04:10,744 --> 00:04:11,577
No!

105
00:04:13,443 --> 00:04:16,588
This is painful, this is so cringey!

106
00:04:16,588 --> 00:04:18,943
No, no no no, okay!

107
00:04:18,943 --> 00:04:20,158
Yo!

108
00:04:20,158 --> 00:04:21,625
What was that?!

109
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:22,937
What am I trying to do?

110
00:04:22,937 --> 00:04:24,403
I think I'm doing like a parkour video.

111
00:04:24,403 --> 00:04:27,020
- [Girl] We should go to another part.

112
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,346
- No this park's awesome.

113
00:04:28,346 --> 00:04:29,236
The park is awesome.

114
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:31,403
- [Girl] No, another part.

115
00:04:32,282 --> 00:04:34,933
- That was so good, did you guys see that?

116
00:04:34,933 --> 00:04:35,766
Wow!

117
00:04:35,766 --> 00:04:37,097
- [Girl] I think your grandmother could do that!

118
00:04:37,097 --> 00:04:39,180
(laughs)

119
00:04:40,358 --> 00:04:42,608
- Uh oh, watch me jump, oh!

120
00:04:44,031 --> 00:04:45,648
Oh!

121
00:04:45,648 --> 00:04:48,315
- [Girl] Kinda missed you there.

122
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,687
- Uh oh, no, he is not walking along the little rail,

123
00:04:54,687 --> 00:04:58,647
oh my gosh, this guy, he is literally crazy.

124
00:04:58,647 --> 00:05:01,358
Uh oh, uh oh, is he gonna jump?

125
00:05:01,358 --> 00:05:02,919
Is he gonna jump?

126
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:03,752
Oh!

127
00:05:09,936 --> 00:05:11,079
I just did that!

128
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:12,577
This is some throwback magic, now real quick,

129
00:05:12,577 --> 00:05:15,352
can I point out, that's an exposed angle!

130
00:05:15,352 --> 00:05:17,287
Who was filming this?!

131
00:05:17,287 --> 00:05:18,684
That was an exposed angle!

132
00:05:18,684 --> 00:05:19,517
Mom!

133
00:05:19,517 --> 00:05:20,521
You exposed my trick.

134
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:21,529
You can tell by the lighting.

135
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:23,385
I've got this new trick and I just want you

136
00:05:23,385 --> 00:05:25,855
to check that out, there's no card on here, right?

137
00:05:25,855 --> 00:05:26,772
Oh man, no!

138
00:05:27,804 --> 00:05:29,818
There's no card on there.

139
00:05:29,818 --> 00:05:32,056
Literally froze a card in there.

140
00:05:32,056 --> 00:05:35,112
There is no card in this, okay?

141
00:05:35,112 --> 00:05:37,591
That's the most raggedy looking kitchen towel

142
00:05:37,591 --> 00:05:39,021
I've ever seen!

143
00:05:39,021 --> 00:05:41,768
To get a card to go through this onto the ice.

144
00:05:41,768 --> 00:05:44,209
Why is there a walkie-talkie right there on the table?

145
00:05:44,209 --> 00:05:45,741
Make sure there's no card there or anything.

146
00:05:45,741 --> 00:05:47,178
- [Mom] Correct.

147
00:05:47,178 --> 00:05:49,383
- Alright so here, now I'm going to take a card,

148
00:05:49,383 --> 00:05:51,276
you know Tom, right?

149
00:05:51,276 --> 00:05:55,202
Okay I'm gonna take Tom and then if I take Tom, right?

150
00:05:55,202 --> 00:05:56,678
I'm gonna put him on here.

151
00:05:56,678 --> 00:05:57,861
This is bad.

152
00:05:57,861 --> 00:06:01,944
Props to me for at least trying something though.

153
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:05,302
It looks like Tom went too far, do you see

154
00:06:05,302 --> 00:06:08,408
that there's a little blue spot down there?

155
00:06:08,408 --> 00:06:09,385
(laughs)

156
00:06:09,385 --> 00:06:11,709
When you low-key froze the card in the ice so deep

157
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:13,436
you can't even see it.

158
00:06:13,436 --> 00:06:15,369
(laughs)

159
00:06:15,369 --> 00:06:18,840
(banging on ice)

160
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,007
My mom is like "Collins, what are you doing with your life?"

161
00:06:26,044 --> 00:06:28,127
(laughs)

162
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:32,621
I'm making a total mess!

163
00:06:32,621 --> 00:06:34,168
- [Mom] You might want to take this outside!

164
00:06:34,168 --> 00:06:35,204
(laughs)

165
00:06:35,204 --> 00:06:37,186
- My mom's like "Okay, we're done with this."

166
00:06:37,186 --> 00:06:38,596
(banging on ice)

167
00:06:38,596 --> 00:06:41,668
How long am I gonna bang on ice with a knife for, what?!

168
00:06:41,668 --> 00:06:42,972
There we go!

169
00:06:42,972 --> 00:06:44,564
You guys can see that, right?

170
00:06:44,564 --> 00:06:45,796
- [Mom] I can see that.

171
00:06:45,796 --> 00:06:47,625
- It's in the ice, right?

172
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:50,576
There we go, the moment I've been waiting for

173
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,776
this whole time, to show them that their card.

174
00:06:52,776 --> 00:06:55,099
- [Mom] There he is!

175
00:06:55,099 --> 00:06:57,048
(claps)

176
00:06:57,048 --> 00:06:58,590
- Great job, Collins, great job.

177
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:00,062
So this is a little meet-and-greet we did

178
00:07:00,062 --> 00:07:00,895
after the Demi tour.

179
00:07:00,895 --> 00:07:03,770
Yo those things were crazy, after the Demi tour

180
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:06,403
every night, that was insane!

181
00:07:06,403 --> 00:07:08,213
But yeah, straight up again, I love meeting you guys,

182
00:07:08,213 --> 00:07:09,951
I love meeting you guys.

183
00:07:09,951 --> 00:07:11,130
Okay let me set this up really quick,

184
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:13,381
I got pink eye in both eyes, my mom said put lemon juice

185
00:07:13,381 --> 00:07:15,250
in it to cure it, so.

186
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,083
(screaming)

187
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,250
That stuff's intense, wow!

188
00:07:19,328 --> 00:07:21,394
Jeez, it's like my eyes are on fire!

189
00:07:21,394 --> 00:07:24,811
(screaming and whooping)

190
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:30,082
- [Man] Does it hurt?

191
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:31,009
- Yes!

192
00:07:31,009 --> 00:07:32,348
Oh yes!

193
00:07:32,348 --> 00:07:33,830
This stuff's intense!

194
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:37,247
(screaming and whooping)

195
00:07:38,737 --> 00:07:42,778
It's pulsating with death and destruction and doom!

196
00:07:42,778 --> 00:07:43,986
Wow!

197
00:07:43,986 --> 00:07:45,256
