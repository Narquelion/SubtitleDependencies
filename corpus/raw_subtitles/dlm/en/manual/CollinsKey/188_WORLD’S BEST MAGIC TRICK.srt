00:00:00,279 --> 00:00:02,862
(gentle music)

2
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:06,829
- Give me 60 seconds to introduce you to a brand new kind

3
00:00:06,829 --> 00:00:09,956
of entertainment that will blow your mind.

4
00:00:09,956 --> 00:00:11,426
(cheering)

5
00:00:11,426 --> 00:00:13,778
I wanna connect with you and I wanna pull you in to the show

6
00:00:13,778 --> 00:00:16,041
and I want you to be a part of what's going on.

7
00:00:16,041 --> 00:00:16,874
- [Woman] Come find me.

8
00:00:16,874 --> 00:00:18,688
- Imagine a show that lives on your phone

9
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:20,169
and has you at the center.

10
00:00:20,169 --> 00:00:21,618
By simply writing in the comments, you could take

11
00:00:21,618 --> 00:00:24,078
the storyline in totally different directions,

12
00:00:24,078 --> 00:00:27,091
depending on what you like and share at the time.

13
00:00:27,091 --> 00:00:28,386
What if parts of the show existed

14
00:00:28,386 --> 00:00:31,053
in the real world, in real time,

15
00:00:32,027 --> 00:00:34,904
and you could be part of the action as it happens.

16
00:00:34,904 --> 00:00:37,060
That's what AT&T Hello Lab is all about.

17
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:38,783
Amazing new shows all connected

18
00:00:38,783 --> 00:00:41,100
by what you do on your phone.

19
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,256
Shows that simply couldn't exist without you guys.

20
00:00:45,256 --> 00:00:47,043
Watch the show we made together,

21
00:00:47,043 --> 00:00:50,050

22
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,300
(cheering)

23
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:54,749
Do you guys wanna see some magic?
