1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,270
- Let's see if it turned purple.

2
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:03,430
- [Both] Three, two, one.

3
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:05,170
- You challenged us to make a purple watermelon.

4
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:06,670
- First step is to cut a hole in the top.

5
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:07,780
- My thing's like all bendy right now,

6
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:08,950
I can't get it in right.

7
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:09,990
- Ah-hah. Got it.

8
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,240
- All right, next step, we gotta get the cabbage.

9
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,450
Three, two, one, just like that.

10
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:14,283
All right. - Whoa.

11
00:00:14,283 --> 00:00:15,960
Now, don't do this at home, and if you do,

12
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,370
make sure you have someone to help you out

13
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:18,290
who's more experienced.

14
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:19,123
Just gonna chop 'em up a little bit more,

15
00:00:19,123 --> 00:00:20,940
because you gotta chop 'em up very finely,

16
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,090
that's very important for this hack.

17
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:22,923
So like this, here. - I got some in my eye.

18
00:00:22,923 --> 00:00:24,920
- And the crazy thing is the cabbage actually acts

19
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,150
as a natural food coloring.

20
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:27,960
- Wait, is it gonna taste like cabbage, now?

21
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,060
- Oh, I didn't even think about that.

22
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,380
Cabbage-flavored watermelon?

23
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:31,850
- Ugh. - That doesn't sound too good.

24
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:32,683
- I hope not.

25
00:00:32,683 --> 00:00:33,516
- I've been watching a lot of chef shows,

26
00:00:33,516 --> 00:00:34,580
I think I got the technique down.

27
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,070
It's all in the wrist, man.

28
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,060
- It is? - Yep.

29
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:37,893
Just wrist.

30
00:00:37,893 --> 00:00:39,100
- What chef shows are you watching?

31
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:39,933
- It's all of 'em.

32
00:00:39,933 --> 00:00:40,930
- Yours looks very chopped up.

33
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:43,150
- Yeah, it's smelling like a cabbage in here right now.

34
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:44,610
And it's time to make the food coloring.

35
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,130
Next step, we gotta add it all to my pan,

36
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:46,963
so here we go.

37
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:48,210
Just gonna pop it in here like this, perfect.

38
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:49,570
Next, we're gonna add water in,

39
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:51,590
and then we're gonna let it boil for 15 minutes.

40
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:52,840
Cabbages are all boiled down.

41
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,800
Oh, that stinks, bro.

42
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,633
Let's mix it up.

43
00:00:55,633 --> 00:00:57,760
Whoa, dude, it turned blue as it melted down.

44
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,320
- [Both] Whoa.

45
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,520
- That's pretty crazy.

46
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,430
- That's pretty pungent.

47
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:02,470
Just gonna dump it in, you ready?

48
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:04,168
Three, you already going? Okay.

49
00:01:04,168 --> 00:01:05,001
- Yeah, I'm going. - Here we go.

50
00:01:05,001 --> 00:01:06,954
Oh, my gosh, dude, it's actually purple.

51
00:01:06,954 --> 00:01:09,610
- Oh, yeah. - I'm losing cabbages.

52
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:10,443
What, did you get some cabbage in there?

53
00:01:10,443 --> 00:01:12,120
- I'm losing cabbage. - Oh, no, I lost some cabbage.

54
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,440
- It's crazy how blue it's turned.

55
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,160
- Now, time to transfer it to our glass jars.

56
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,320
So, Devan, this is really where it comes down to skill,

57
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,153
because you cannot spill it.

58
00:01:18,153 --> 00:01:19,420
I'm gonna pop this on top, because, Devan,

59
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:20,470
I don't trust myself.

60
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,350
Three, two, one.

61
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,183
Okay, it's going in.

62
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:25,507
Oh, I spilled it, I spilled it, no.

63
00:01:25,507 --> 00:01:27,520
Yo, I spilled it and it got on me, bro.

64
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,353
- I spilled a little, too.

65
00:01:28,353 --> 00:01:30,150
- All in all, not too bad.

66
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,310
Time to add it to the watermelon.

67
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,810
Now it's time to see if this will actually turn it

68
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:33,643
into a different color.

69
00:01:33,643 --> 00:01:34,476
So here we go.

70
00:01:34,476 --> 00:01:35,309
Got some turkey basters.

71
00:01:35,309 --> 00:01:36,500
Let's see if this actually turns blue

72
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,356
within the turkey baster itself.

73
00:01:38,356 --> 00:01:40,532
- [Both] Oh!

74
00:01:40,532 --> 00:01:41,365
- I got it, I got it.

75
00:01:41,365 --> 00:01:42,210
- It's so purple. - What do we do next?

76
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,440
- All right, now we just go here in the top.

77
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,610
Stick it in a little bit, there we go.

78
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:45,680
On the count of three, we're gonna dispense.

79
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,773
Here we go, one, two, three.

80
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,140
Is yours going anywhere? - No.

81
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,147
- Maybe we should remove it a little bit, and then--

82
00:01:52,147 --> 00:01:52,980
- [Both] Oh!

83
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,000
- It's overflowing a bit.

84
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,420
- And all the way, boom, to the top.

85
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,100
The real question is, is it going to work?

86
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:58,933
But more importantly,

87
00:01:58,933 --> 00:02:00,260
will it make the watermelon taste funny?

88
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,680
We'll be trying that at the end of the video.

89
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,970
You challenged us to do the shaving cream art challenge.

90
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,773
And right now, I'm gonna fill up my slate right here.

91
00:02:05,773 --> 00:02:07,260
So this is kinda my canvas.

92
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,093
Devan, how's yours going?

93
00:02:08,093 --> 00:02:09,380
- It's going fantastic.

94
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,660
It's like a picture frame.

95
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,700
- I can help you out if you need some help.

96
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,676
- Nope, no, no, no, no, I'm good.

97
00:02:12,676 --> 00:02:13,509
- All right, here we go.

98
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:14,850
Just gonna use a little bit of a squeegee thing, here.

99
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:17,200
So it's where you're gonna try to flatten off the top.

100
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,033
I have an idea.

101
00:02:18,033 --> 00:02:20,220
You're creating a boring, flat piece of artwork.

102
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,720
I'm gonna create a 3D sculpture artwork.

103
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,740
You ain't never seen that before.

104
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,340
- I feel like I'm shaving the largest square face

105
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,173
in the world.

106
00:02:27,173 --> 00:02:28,830
Dude, this reminds me of a zen garden.

107
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,140
- Mine reminds me of a mosh pit.

108
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,078
- Oh, man, this is a difficult medium, bro.

109
00:02:32,078 --> 00:02:32,911
Wow. - Here's what's so funny

110
00:02:32,911 --> 00:02:34,735
about mine, bro, look at this.

111
00:02:34,735 --> 00:02:35,641
It's so jiggly.

112
00:02:35,641 --> 00:02:38,170
This is the pyramid of shacreama.

113
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:40,120
Oh, snap, dude, I'm gonna use these straws,

114
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,200
just like this, to actually put the color into the middle,

115
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,310
of mount shakira.

116
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,700
- Dude, look at this.

117
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,115
- And dude, I have such a good idea.

118
00:02:47,115 --> 00:02:48,160
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

119
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,240
- What? - Careful.

120
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,073
- I'm sorry.

121
00:02:50,073 --> 00:02:50,980
These straws are going to allow me--

122
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,440
- Dude! What did I just tell you?

123
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,847
- They're gonna allow me to implant the food coloring--

124
00:02:54,847 --> 00:02:56,510
- Dude! You just bumped me again!

125
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,850
- Here we go, so we're just gonna put these in here,

126
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:58,683
like this.

127
00:02:58,683 --> 00:02:59,516
Let's get some food coloring.

128
00:02:59,516 --> 00:03:00,750
I'm gonna add some drops of yellow down here.

129
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,590
And last, but not least, we've got red right here.

130
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,800
So we're just gonna add that in.

131
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,950
And now that there's food coloring all in the middle

132
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:08,050
of mount shacreama, it's time to add some on the outside.

133
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:09,410
So just gonna add a couple little drops.

134
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:10,683
Here we go, one, two.

135
00:03:10,683 --> 00:03:12,103
I gotta add one over here.

136
00:03:12,103 --> 00:03:12,936
So we're just gonna go drop--

137
00:03:12,936 --> 00:03:14,250
Oh, that was a lot of green. Oops.

138
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,110
Yellow, drawing right down the center, just like this.

139
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,341
A whole stream of yellow, going right down like that.

140
00:03:17,341 --> 00:03:18,876
- Wow. - There we go.

141
00:03:18,876 --> 00:03:21,543
(playful music)

142
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,500
- All right, time to set my shaving cream art.

143
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,640
- And as you do that, it's time to make my art over here.

144
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,890
So now is the moment I've been waiting for,

145
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:28,940
time to mix it all up.

146
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:29,773
So here we go.

147
00:03:29,773 --> 00:03:31,310
Shockingly, I don't really have an eye for this.

148
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,080
You know what, I'm gonna remove the straws first.

149
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,623
Oh. Oh!

150
00:03:34,623 --> 00:03:35,737
- Ooh, it's working, it's working.

151
00:03:35,737 --> 00:03:38,190
- You think yours is working, bro, check out mine, bro.

152
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,170
Time to get in here with the hands

153
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:40,373
and really make some great-looking art.

154
00:03:40,373 --> 00:03:42,120
- Look at your hands, dude.

155
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,590
- Oh, no!

156
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,190
Here we go, just gotta weegee, weegee, weegee, weegee.

157
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,420
Now I got a piece of paper to complete my art,

158
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,335
so here we go.

159
00:03:47,335 --> 00:03:48,580
(crackly thumping)

160
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,580
Now we gotta let it sit, and you get to comment down below,

161
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,430
whose art do you think turned out better?

162
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,480
We'll be doing the reveal of these

163
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,313
at the end of the video.

164
00:03:54,313 --> 00:03:56,890
You challenged us to make the weirdest DIY candles ever.

165
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,260
So right now, let's go.

166
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,996
First up, we gotta shred some candles, so just like--

167
00:03:59,996 --> 00:04:01,540
- Whoa, hey now. - Oh, man.

168
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,470
I gotta-- - I'm using a cheese grater.

169
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,300
- Look at this, bro, it looks so good.

170
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,690
- Don't try this at home, and if you do,

171
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:08,540
make sure you have someone who's very experienced

172
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,210
helping you out, because this is not easy.

173
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:11,043
Here we go.

174
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:12,500
Yo, wait a minute, bro, this works.

175
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,333
Look at this. - Wow.

176
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,350
- Dude, this is innovation at its finest,

177
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,183
right here, bro.

178
00:04:16,183 --> 00:04:17,497
- How? Dude, I need that.

179
00:04:17,497 --> 00:04:20,170
All right, next up, I'm gonna use this knife here,

180
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:22,210
to kinda take off a bit of the edges.

181
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,690
- The thing is, you've got a curved blade.

182
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:24,589
Why would you have a curved blade

183
00:04:24,589 --> 00:04:26,300
when you have eight these things?

184
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,100
All right, I'm just gonna stick this on top, and then twist.

185
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,580
Yo, dude, mine's kinda like a windmill in a way.

186
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,984
It's like, whee.

187
00:04:30,984 --> 00:04:32,052
- [Both] Oh.

188
00:04:32,052 --> 00:04:32,885
- That's way too-- Whoa.

189
00:04:32,885 --> 00:04:33,718
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - What, what?

190
00:04:34,946 --> 00:04:35,962
- You almost lost all my progress.

191
00:04:35,962 --> 00:04:36,795
- I'm sorry.

192
00:04:36,795 --> 00:04:38,630
Three, two, one, scoop-- Ah!

193
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,740
Man, these are tough candles, bro, dude.

194
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:40,573
- I know, man.

195
00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:43,200
I think you're losing more than you're gaining, bro.

196
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,430
- Why would you do it on the edge of the table,

197
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,015
when you can do it on a glass jar?

198
00:04:46,015 --> 00:04:46,848
- It worked! - That's not a smart idea.

199
00:04:46,848 --> 00:04:48,335
If you could name your wick, there, what would you name it?

200
00:04:48,335 --> 00:04:49,502
- John. - Yeah!

201
00:04:51,477 --> 00:04:53,385
We've got the wax shaved down.

202
00:04:53,385 --> 00:04:54,630
- Really, dude? - Oh my gosh.

203
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,880
All right, now it's time to melt it.

204
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,510
Before we can add the hot wax into the gloves,

205
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,330
we need to cut little holes in the fingertips.

206
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,050
Thread the wick through those little holes,

207
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:01,990
and then tape them together.

208
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:03,640
Basically you have to spread the glove out

209
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,570
across the top opening of this bottle.

210
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:06,450
So here we go. I'm almost there.

211
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:07,721
- Ooh, I got it, I got it, I got it.

212
00:05:07,721 --> 00:05:08,580
- Did you get it? Okay, there we go.

213
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,200
We've got the hot wax, and do not try this at home.

214
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,700
We're gonna be extremely careful right now.

215
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,400
We're gonna pour the wax in, ready?

216
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,310
Three, two, one.

217
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,530
First five-second subscribe challenge.

218
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,350
We wanna see if you can subscribe to this channel,

219
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:22,180
and turn on the channel post notifications in five seconds.

220
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,013
Are you ready?

221
00:05:23,013 --> 00:05:23,846
Here we go.

222
00:05:23,846 --> 00:05:28,010
- [Both] Five, four, three, two, one.

223
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:28,843
Done.

224
00:05:28,843 --> 00:05:29,676
- And if you can do that, comment down below,

225
00:05:29,676 --> 00:05:30,600
Keyper Squad, right now.

226
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,073
Here we go, three, two, one.

227
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:34,500
- [Both] Oh.

228
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,220
- Okay, right there, boom, that is it.

229
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,960
- Whoa, dude, look at mine.

230
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,690
I actually added crayons in it.

231
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:41,540
So if you wanna color it, you can add crayons.

232
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,370
Time to add my last bit, here.

233
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:44,320
- [Both] Oh!

234
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,697
- Dude, the precision, yes!

235
00:05:45,697 --> 00:05:47,670
I feel like a puppet-master right now.

236
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,920
Dude, if this works, this will be crazy.

237
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,730
We'll be trying these at the end of the video.

238
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:54,100
Next up, we're turning an orange into a juice bottle.

239
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,420
- All right, first step is done.

240
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,450
- That's the wrong first step, though,

241
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:57,710
you're supposed to tenderize it first, Devan.

242
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:58,543
- Do what?

243
00:05:58,543 --> 00:05:59,376
- I'm actually really surprised,

244
00:05:59,376 --> 00:06:00,860
because tenderizing it brings out a ton of juices,

245
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,693
I did not expect that.

246
00:06:01,693 --> 00:06:02,700
- Dude, yeah, I mean, look at mine.

247
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,040
There's actually some juice already.

248
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,283
- All right, here we go, let's just.

249
00:06:05,283 --> 00:06:06,440
- It's a spatula?

250
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,144
- I don't know, it's like, to flip your orange.

251
00:06:08,144 --> 00:06:10,396
All right, here we go, three, two, one, mid-air catch.

252
00:06:10,396 --> 00:06:11,590
- [Both] Oh!

253
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:12,490
- What?

254
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:14,322
- [Both] Oh!

255
00:06:14,322 --> 00:06:15,470
Oh!

256
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,490
- Three times!

257
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:17,323
Oh.

258
00:06:17,323 --> 00:06:18,156
All right, done with these steps,

259
00:06:18,156 --> 00:06:19,640
now it's time to cut off the top of the bottle.

260
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,520
- As you do that, time to cut off the top of my orange,

261
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,600
and see how juicy it is on the inside.

262
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,433
Ow! - Whoa.

263
00:06:24,433 --> 00:06:26,100
- Not as bad as lemon juice in the eye,

264
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,720
but still, orange juice in the eye is not fun.

265
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,200
Boom, it's out, we got the little stem.

266
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,140
Let's see how juicy it is, here we go.

267
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:31,973
Let's squeeze.

268
00:06:31,973 --> 00:06:32,806
- Yeah.

269
00:06:32,806 --> 00:06:33,940
- Lemme see yours? - Yeah.

270
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:34,773
- Oh, wow.

271
00:06:34,773 --> 00:06:35,606
Time for me to follow in your footsteps,

272
00:06:35,606 --> 00:06:36,860
and cut off the top of the bottle.

273
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:37,990
- I gotta sneeze.

274
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:38,823
- Put the orange under your nose,

275
00:06:38,823 --> 00:06:40,820
it'll actually help you not sneeze.

276
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:41,653
- That actually worked.

277
00:06:41,653 --> 00:06:43,540
All right, now it's time to put this top on,

278
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,373
just like this.

279
00:06:44,373 --> 00:06:46,200
- We've got some hot glue, we're gonna be very careful,

280
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,450
and do not try this at home.

281
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,480
Time to seal the bottle cap onto the orange.

282
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,740
You know what, I think mine is actually going pretty well.

283
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,080
All right, the tops are glued on.

284
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,230
- And dude, I think mine looks way cooler than yours.

285
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:57,280
- Yeah, but mine is gonna work way better than yours,

286
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,830
so right now, it's time to go test them out.

287
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,990
This one, we're turning slime into an eraser.

288
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,087
Oh, dude, we're kinda making oobleck.

289
00:07:02,087 --> 00:07:03,630
You gotta be super careful, because this stuff

290
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,890
will just go crazy all of a sudden.

291
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:05,920
All right, next I'm trying to mix it around.

292
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,753
And I'm actually curious

293
00:07:06,753 --> 00:07:07,960
if this is gonna create oobleck or not.

294
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,910
Oh, boy.

295
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,353
A pinch of baking soda, just like this.

296
00:07:10,353 --> 00:07:12,150
- All right. - Maybe the baking soda

297
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,580
is what actually turns this into the eraser?

298
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,240
Ironically, I'm gonna use a pencil to mix it up.

299
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,750
- Yours is a lot more finely mixed than mine is.

300
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,810
- And now, for the final step, we gotta add the activator.

301
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:20,837
So, we're gonna take this off, oh, man.

302
00:07:20,837 --> 00:07:22,453
- You're on the final step, already?

303
00:07:22,453 --> 00:07:23,286
- I'm already on the final step.

304
00:07:23,286 --> 00:07:24,880
This is actually very unusual, that I'm beating you on this.

305
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,070
Yours looks all chunky and funky.

306
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,190
Time to go in with the hands, here we go.

307
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,380
Just gonna scoop it around.

308
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,630
Oh, man.

309
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:30,700
- I should've rolled up my sleeves.

310
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,200
This might not be an eraser, but it turns into slime.

311
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,260
- And it feels like oobleck, like,

312
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,700
it has that same kind of, like, sandy feeling, almost.

313
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,550
I don't know how to describe it.

314
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:38,510
Ah, see, here's the issue.

315
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,783
I don't have enough activator in it right now,

316
00:07:39,783 --> 00:07:41,482
because it's just all sticking to my hands.

317
00:07:41,482 --> 00:07:42,361
- It's like dough, bro.

318
00:07:42,361 --> 00:07:43,834
- What if I dip it into the activator?

319
00:07:43,834 --> 00:07:45,100
Just gonna dip it in, and we'll pull it out.

320
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,410
Here we go, dip it in, pull it out.

321
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:47,289
Okay, there we go. - I need some of that,

322
00:07:47,289 --> 00:07:48,230
I need some of that.

323
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,140
Oh, I wanted to add food coloring, bro.

324
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:50,973
- Oh, you haven't added food coloring?

325
00:07:50,973 --> 00:07:51,806
- I gotta do it.

326
00:07:51,806 --> 00:07:52,639
- You gotta do that real quick, bro.

327
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,800
It's like dough, you can just stretch it out.

328
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,970
But you do not wanna break it.

329
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:55,803
- The blue isn't mixing in.

330
00:07:55,803 --> 00:07:57,670
- Since yours is blue, I'm gonna make mine red.

331
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:59,430
So we're gonna put some red food coloring in it, here.

332
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,320
Gonna kind of let it drip down.

333
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,153
Oh, no.

334
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:02,963
I'm losing control.

335
00:08:02,963 --> 00:08:04,960
- This really does feel like an eraser.

336
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,510
- Mine looks kinda like a rose, right now.

337
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,317
Like a weird white rose that's somewhat red.

338
00:08:08,317 --> 00:08:09,150
All right, here we go.

339
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:11,010
At long last, time to fold in the last little piece,

340
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:11,870
right here, boom.

341
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,630
All right, and now we can actually mix in freedom.

342
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,330
It's much cooler than making the whole thing red,

343
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:16,711
because it's gonna be all marbled and red.

344
00:08:16,711 --> 00:08:17,560
I wonder if it bounces.

345
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,700
Dude, see if it bounces.

346
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,533
- Oh, oh, are you ready?

347
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:20,860
Three, two, one.

348
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,693
- [Both] Oh!

349
00:08:21,693 --> 00:08:23,020
- This is like, three things at once.

350
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:25,300
It's an eraser, allegedly, it's also a bouncy,

351
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,587
and it's like a squishy, because you can just squish it,

352
00:08:26,587 --> 00:08:28,140
and it's so satisfying.

353
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,930
- It's also a discus.

354
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,310
- All right, now it's time to write on the paper

355
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,530
and see if it will really erase it.

356
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:33,810
I'm gonna choose a colored pencil,

357
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:34,643
this might throw it all off.

358
00:08:34,643 --> 00:08:36,060
- And I'm gonna try a non-colored pencil.

359
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,070
- I shouldn't choose the color red,

360
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:38,280
because that's the exact same color as my slime.

361
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,140
We'll go green, here we go.

362
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,170
Gonna do a little happy face.

363
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:41,470
- Oh, I'm also gonna do a happy face.

364
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,240
- You can clearly tell where my pancake art skills

365
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,073
come from.

366
00:08:44,073 --> 00:08:44,906
There we go, my dude, look at him.

367
00:08:44,906 --> 00:08:45,960
He's very, very, very.

368
00:08:46,816 --> 00:08:48,250
We got the erasers, and the real question is,

369
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,770
is it actually going to work.

370
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:51,460
And we'll be testing this at the end of the video.

371
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,820
You challenged us to turn a hair dryer

372
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,950
into a vacuum cleaner.

373
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,280
So right now, let's go.

374
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,621
- [Both] Hey!

375
00:08:56,621 --> 00:08:58,140
- All right. - High five.

376
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:58,973
- Oh, oh, oh.

377
00:08:58,973 --> 00:09:00,438
Now it's time to create the back of my vacuum.

378
00:09:00,438 --> 00:09:02,710
- And now it's time to secure my vacuum bag in place.

379
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:03,543
I don't know really what it's called,

380
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,640
but basically this is the thing that's gonna catch

381
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,750
all the little particles over here.

382
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,320
You're only using one scissors, I've got two scissors.

383
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,090
Do not try this at home, especially not with a hair dryer.

384
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:13,170
- That seems to be doing a lot more destruction

385
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,030
than actual cutting.

386
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,040
- All right, I'm just gonna hot glue this.

387
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,740
Again, do not do this at home.

388
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,310
And the issue is, mine's kinda all jagged

389
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:19,220
from the way that I cut it.

390
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,780
Now we're just gonna have to line the inside.

391
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,830
- All right, now it's time to add it to the back, here.

392
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,400
- Here we go, just gonna put it on, like that.

393
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,390
- Nice. - Oh, I smeared the glue.

394
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,120
It feels pretty air-tight to me, how about yours?

395
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,640
- Yep, mine's air-tight.

396
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,180
- These actually look--

397
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,263
Let's just turn 'em on really quick to see what happens.

398
00:09:34,364 --> 00:09:36,080
Ah, it's like a little sock puppet dude, hey, what's up?

399
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,510
The vacuums are made, and the real question is,

400
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,750
is this thing really gonna work?

401
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:39,857
We'll be testing it at the end of the video.

402
00:09:39,857 --> 00:09:41,650
And right now, we're on to the next one.

403
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:44,027
Now that is a lot of gum stuck on your jeans.

404
00:09:44,027 --> 00:09:45,820
- Oh, no. It is not coming off.

405
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,653
- Take some ice cubes.

406
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:48,840
Just put ice cubes on top of this, it'll freeze the gum,

407
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,550
and allow you to peel it off effortlessly.

408
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,520
All right, I think it's frozen enough,

409
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,040
so here it is, the moment of truth.

410
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,200
Let's see if this works, you ready?

411
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,700
Gonna give it a little peel, right over here.

412
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,625
- [Both] Oh!

413
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:57,790
- This side is started,

414
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,190
let's try to get up this side over here.

415
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,023
The back side is coming up.

416
00:10:00,023 --> 00:10:01,480
Dude. - How is this possible?

417
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,338
- It's coming up.

418
00:10:02,338 --> 00:10:03,580
Okay, so we got off this little bit over here.

419
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,413
- Nice. - Okay, like,

420
00:10:04,413 --> 00:10:05,410
it's not all the way frozen.

421
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:07,150
So maybe we just haven't waited long enough yet.

422
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,200
But, we waited a long time.

423
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,130
This took, like, ten minutes.

424
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:09,963
- We need more ice.

425
00:10:09,963 --> 00:10:10,800
- I got a little mini spatula,

426
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,633
let's see if this helps at all.

427
00:10:11,633 --> 00:10:13,263
So I wanna see if we can just push off some of it,

428
00:10:13,263 --> 00:10:14,096
like this.

429
00:10:14,096 --> 00:10:15,580
- I don't know if this is necessarily a win, yet.

430
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,960
- Oh, look at that.

431
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,960
That's a big chunk at once.

432
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,960
I'm actually happy this is working,

433
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,260
because now we can get this off your pants.

434
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,540
- My pants? - Yeah, these are your pants.

435
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,373
You didn't recognize 'em?

436
00:10:22,373 --> 00:10:23,360
- Why would you grab my pants?

437
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,890
- Well, because they're new, and you haven't worn 'em yet,

438
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,000
and I thought you probably don't know if you like 'em.

439
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,080
Let's try to do an alternative solution, right now.

440
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,913
Excuse me, here we go.

441
00:10:28,913 --> 00:10:31,420
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, dude, those are my new pants.

442
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,440
- I know, but I can't have you going out

443
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,273
with gum on your pants.

444
00:10:33,273 --> 00:10:34,106
Well, you know what, dude?

445
00:10:34,106 --> 00:10:34,939
I think this hack actually works.

446
00:10:34,939 --> 00:10:36,022
So, you get to comment down below,

447
00:10:36,022 --> 00:10:38,000
do you think this is actually a win or a fail?

448
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,840
You challenged us to use an iron for cooking.

449
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,670
I'm gonna be making a whole bunch of egg dishes.

450
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,160
- And I'm making a grilled cheese sandwich.

451
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,950
Dude, I wonder if I can toast my bread.

452
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:45,783
- I got some steam on it.

453
00:10:45,783 --> 00:10:47,500
- Whoa, whoa, I didn't want some steamed bread, dude.

454
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,980
- Why not? - You don't want soggy bread.

455
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,450
- Dude, I don't know if I'm doing this right.

456
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,470
- It just made it flat.

457
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:54,430
- Three, two, one, there we go, oh.

458
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:55,570
- Oh, it's actually working.

459
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:56,990
All right, doing the other side.

460
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:57,823
- Nice.

461
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,120
All right, gonna make a sunny side up egg.

462
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,690
Now, it's time to add the iron.

463
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:02,260
Oh, I wonder if I could cook it like this?

464
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,470
Dude, it's low-key cooking the egg up a little bit.

465
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,303
- Whoa.

466
00:11:05,303 --> 00:11:06,940
I wonder what this button does?

467
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:07,860
- Whoa.

468
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,480
- I'm not gonna press that button again, all right.

469
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,580
Three, two, one.

470
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,840
Three second like challenge.

471
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,270
We wanna see if you can like this video in three seconds.

472
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,510
Are you ready? Here we go.

473
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:18,360
- [Both] Three, two, one, done.

474
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,860
- Here we go, three, two, one.

475
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,164
Oh. - Dude.

476
00:11:22,164 --> 00:11:22,997
- I can hear it sizzling.

477
00:11:22,997 --> 00:11:24,370
It smells like, it smells burnt.

478
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:26,380
Yo. - Oh, look at that.

479
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,213
Dude, it worked.

480
00:11:27,213 --> 00:11:28,120
Dude, that did not work.

481
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,360
- Oh, it's like all caked on, too.

482
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,870
- All right, it has passed the toast test.

483
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,420
The toast test works, with the irons.

484
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,600
- I'm gonna get my eggs off of here.

485
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,230
And if you ever use an iron, be very careful,

486
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,720
and never use it for the purposes

487
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,920
that we're using it for.

488
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:40,911
- I got it. - Balance is on point, okay.

489
00:11:40,911 --> 00:11:42,040
- I got it.

490
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:42,873
No, no, no, no, no.

491
00:11:42,873 --> 00:11:44,930
This is not a sandwich, this is sunny side up.

492
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:46,980
When have you steamed your sunny side up?

493
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:48,923
All right, as you do that,

494
00:11:48,923 --> 00:11:49,929
I'm gonna make some scrambled eggs,

495
00:11:49,929 --> 00:11:50,762
so I'm just gonna put that over there.

496
00:11:50,762 --> 00:11:52,030
But first, I'm gonna try to make an omelet.

497
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:52,890
So here we go, oh.

498
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:54,810
- Gonna be a very shelly omelet.

499
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:56,820
This is taking way longer than I expected.

500
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,670
- Well, yeah, it's just cooking, bro.

501
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:00,520
Set this off to the side,

502
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,380
and let's just add in a whole bunch of eggs.

503
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,440
- Well, we have a problem.

504
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,340
I didn't use any Pam, so this is thoroughly stuck.

505
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,200
- Come on, Devan, what's the first thing you learn

506
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,290
when cooking with an iron?

507
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:11,400
You use Pam.

508
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,926
- I've never done this before, man.

509
00:12:12,926 --> 00:12:14,040
Oh, oh.

510
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,117
- Dude. - Sunny side up.

511
00:12:15,117 --> 00:12:17,510
- Dude, you're so close, dude, the suspense.

512
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:19,210
- Yes! - Oh!

513
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:21,480
No way. - Expertly made sunny side up.

514
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,360
Piece of bread, down.

515
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,080
Gonna grab a bunch of cheese.

516
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,720
Now, I put this piece of bread on top like this.

517
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,553
Nicely done.

518
00:12:27,553 --> 00:12:30,450
Now I'm gonna wrap this up in the tin foil, like this.

519
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:33,640
- Oh no! - Dude, did you get it on you?

520
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,800
- I got it on my merch. No!

521
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,470
All right, I'm gonna clear out the shells right now.

522
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,930
- Use some steam.

523
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:40,130
- Life hack, if you don't have a spatula,

524
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:41,660
you can use your hands to make scrambled eggs.

525
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,850
- There is no way I'm eating that. Uh-uh.

526
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,380
- So here we go, gonna grab some cheese in here.

527
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,990
Just sprinkle this in, I fee like an artist, right now.

528
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:47,823
- Very pretty

529
00:12:47,823 --> 00:12:49,310
- All right, I'm making the perfect batch of scrambled eggs.

530
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,143
- How does it feel?

531
00:12:50,143 --> 00:12:52,587
- It feels kind of like slimy from the eggs,

532
00:12:52,587 --> 00:12:54,690
but then there's this weird, kind of rubbery texture

533
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:55,523
from the cheese.

534
00:12:55,523 --> 00:12:56,550
- All right, I'm gonna flip mine over

535
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,450
and see how this works.

536
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:58,283
- All right, so here we go,

537
00:12:58,283 --> 00:12:59,370
let's just steam this thing up.

538
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:00,960
Whoa, look at that, man.

539
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,360
Here we go, three. - Two, one.

540
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,220
- Oh.

541
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,053
- Can you hear it sizzling?

542
00:13:05,053 --> 00:13:07,390
Oh, it's working, for sure, dude, you hear that?

543
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,403
- Yep. Steam it.

544
00:13:09,596 --> 00:13:11,773
- You gotta give me some sort of warning.

545
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,880
I even did it myself, and it scared me.

546
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,542
Dude, look at it, it's bubbling, it's bubbling.

547
00:13:16,542 --> 00:13:17,375
- Ugh.

548
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:18,970
- Dude, this is like, low-key actually working,

549
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,593
and I did not think it would, bro.

550
00:13:20,593 --> 00:13:21,720
This is so cool.

551
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,220
And the real question, is how is this gonna taste?

552
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,380
That face says it all. - Not great.

553
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,870
- It's actually turning into scrambled eggs.

554
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:29,890
Like, if you look at the consistency,

555
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:31,590
like, it's turning into scrambled eggs, man.

556
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:32,660
This is so cool.

557
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,758
Oh, snap.

558
00:13:33,758 --> 00:13:34,980
All right, well I'm gonna be finishing this up,

559
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:35,813
and at the end of the video,

560
00:13:35,813 --> 00:13:37,520
I will be eating my scrambled eggs.

561
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,560
- And we'll find out if this thing actually worked.

562
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,350
- And if it tastes good, so stick around for that.

563
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:43,410
And right now, we are on to the next one.

564
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:46,000
You challenged us to turn a lemon into a spray bottle,

565
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,520
so right now, let's go.

566
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,038
Before we can stick the sprayer into the lemon,

567
00:13:49,038 --> 00:13:50,940
we need to tenderize the lemon to get the juices out.

568
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:51,773
So, here we go.

569
00:13:51,773 --> 00:13:52,707
- Really massage it, you know.

570
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:54,400
- I can almost hear the juices, hold on, hold on.

571
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,680
Sounds like the ocean in there, man.

572
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,660
- It is smelling super zesty in here, bro.

573
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,750
- Oh, most definitely, man.

574
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,870
It's kinda what I expected, though.

575
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,530
My lemon is tenderized enough, and now it's time

576
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:04,960
to cut off the top, and the DIY is almost done.

577
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,830
This one is super easy.

578
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,821
But the real question is, is it going to work?

579
00:14:07,821 --> 00:14:08,958
All right, here we go, time to stick it in.

580
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:10,620
Ow! Oh, man, that hurt.

581
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,830
- Dude. - Oh, my gosh.

582
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:13,120
We'll be doing this in just a little bit,

583
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,970
and right now, we're on to the next one.

584
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:15,120
We've got all the hacks,

585
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,026
and now it's time to test them out

586
00:14:16,026 --> 00:14:17,230
to see if they actually work.

587
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,830
Do not try this at home.

588
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,270
- [Both] Ready? Set, go!

589
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,911
Turn it on, let's see if it works.

590
00:14:21,911 --> 00:14:23,280
- [Both] Oh!

591
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,960
- Dude. No way - This is crazy.

592
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,470
Bro, okay, I wish I had a much smaller quantity,

593
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:29,340
but you can see it in here.

594
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,790
Dude, it totally worked.

595
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,810
All right, here is the art work, it is time to reveal it.

596
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:34,000
I think mine's gonna look amazing.

597
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,390
What we have to do now is just peel all of this off.

598
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,540
- [Both] Three, two, one.

599
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,040
- Super-satisfying, go for it.

600
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:42,100
And we have a huge announcement.

601
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,997
You've been asking for it, and we're doing a live stream.

602
00:14:44,997 --> 00:14:46,370
- How do they watch the live stream?

603
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:47,500
- It's super easy, all you have to do

604
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,050

you can't see anywhere else.

610
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,050
And you might be thinking, this is gonna cost

611
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:01,380
more than $20 a month.

612
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,213
But no!

613
00:15:02,213 --> 00:15:03,560
- $19.99!

614
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,840
- No, man, it's only $4.99.

615
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,650
- Wait, what? Only $4.99?

616
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:08,483
Dude, are you sure?

617
00:15:08,483 --> 00:15:10,730

620
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:14,333
- [Both] Oh!

621
00:15:17,071 --> 00:15:18,019
- No, don't get it on mine.

622
00:15:18,019 --> 00:15:18,852
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

623
00:15:18,852 --> 00:15:21,023
- Bro, this is so satisfying.

624
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,230
That looks so good.

625
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:26,030
Nicely done, oh, the Lego guy, from the Lego Movie.

626
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,070
You get to comment down below,

627
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:28,610
who made better shaving cream art.

628
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:29,870
We've got the hand candles, and first of all,

629
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:30,990
we've got to remove the gloves.

630
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:32,750
Whoa, first of all, look on the inside, bro.

631
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:33,820
It's like, super fragile.

632
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:34,870
- Tada!

633
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,507
They look like little sausage fingers.

634
00:15:36,507 --> 00:15:37,340
Look at that.

635
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,173
- The thumb is the most difficult part,

636
00:15:38,173 --> 00:15:40,140
because if I can get it off the thumb, ah.

637
00:15:41,445 --> 00:15:42,310
- Did you break it?

638
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:43,415
- Not yet, we're good.

639
00:15:43,415 --> 00:15:44,740
Just take it like this, perfect.

640
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,573
Okay.

641
00:15:45,573 --> 00:15:46,530
- Yours looks really cool.

642
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,400
- Gonna set this down, and we're gonna cut off the wicks,

643
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,440
because they're too far away,

644
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,900
so the candle would never get close to the fingers.

645
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,716
- [Both] Three, two, one.

646
00:15:52,716 --> 00:15:53,930
- I'm gonna start with the thumb, first, here we go.

647
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,330
- I'm gonna start with this finger.

648
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,610
Oh, no, we cut 'em too short.

649
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:59,890
- No, no, no, there we go, my thumb's on, okay.

650
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:00,723
- Come on, come on, come on, come on.

651
00:16:00,723 --> 00:16:01,910
- There we go. - You can do it.

652
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,564
Yes. - There we, eh.

653
00:16:03,564 --> 00:16:04,410
Yeah, but, no, yours, yours, right now.

654
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:05,640
Lemme help you out, lemme help you out.

655
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,002
- Oh, this thumb is stubborn.

656
00:16:07,002 --> 00:16:07,835
- Yes! - Yes!

657
00:16:07,835 --> 00:16:09,430
- Dude, so this actually works.

658
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:10,760
This is a complete win.

659
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,380
Oh, oh, no, I blew out one of the fingers.

660
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,396
All right, we've got the lemon sprayers,

661
00:16:13,396 --> 00:16:14,229
and we're gonna test them out.

662
00:16:14,229 --> 00:16:15,062
Yo, dude, I just thought about it,

663
00:16:15,062 --> 00:16:16,710
this is gonna spray out like this.

664
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:19,300
So if you miss your aim, you could hit your eye very easily.

665
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,133
All right, here we go.

666
00:16:20,133 --> 00:16:22,363
Ready, set, go. Ah!

667
00:16:22,363 --> 00:16:23,353
- What? What, what, what?

668
00:16:23,353 --> 00:16:24,186
- It worked.

669
00:16:24,186 --> 00:16:25,019
- Dude, mine didn't work.

670
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:26,270
Dude, what did you do differently?

671
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,570
- I don't know, I really didn't do anything different,

672
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,503
I don't think.

673
00:16:28,503 --> 00:16:29,607
Well, maybe I did it a little bit different.

674
00:16:29,607 --> 00:16:30,777
- Oh, wait, wait, wait.

675
00:16:30,777 --> 00:16:31,610
- [Both] Oh!

676
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:32,443
- I saw it, - I got it.

677
00:16:32,443 --> 00:16:34,690
- there was a little bit that came out.

678
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:36,277
- Now it doesn't work. Yes.

679
00:16:36,277 --> 00:16:38,170
- So, this actually worked, and right now,

680
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:39,110
we're on to the next one.

681
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:40,240
So, my scrambled eggs are cooked.

682
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,103
We got a sunny side up egg.

683
00:16:41,103 --> 00:16:42,750
Here we go, time to take our first little bit.

684
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,040
So I'm gonna use my knife here, in a very civilized manner.

685
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,230
Yo, mine's like, weirdly stringy and gooey.

686
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,500
Well, maybe it's actually the iron itself,

687
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,150
like maybe the iron did something goofy to it.

688
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,912
- This really worked. - Yeah, it did.

689
00:16:51,912 --> 00:16:53,400
I just wanna say, this iron was brand new,

690
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,190
and only used for the cooking of this.

691
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:56,740
And do not use an iron for cooking,

692
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,130
it is not the way it's meant to be used.

693
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:59,560
So, right now, three.

694
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,063
- [Both] Two, one.

695
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:02,633
I don't wanna do this.

696
00:17:06,921 --> 00:17:08,044
- You know, it actually tastes the same.

697
00:17:08,044 --> 00:17:08,877
- I don't know how to describe it.

698
00:17:08,877 --> 00:17:10,930
It's like, gooey, gushy, and disgusting.

699
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:12,550
- Next up, we got these orange bottles.

700
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:14,050
- And to very carefully unscrew the top.

701
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:14,980
Here we go, three.

702
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,053
- [Both] Two, one.

703
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,170
That's it? Wait, wait, wait.

704
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,157
- Oh. - Oh.

705
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,530
- Squeeze it, more comes out.

706
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:23,540
That's kinda interesting.

707
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,681
- Mine's kinda leaking. - Oh, no.

708
00:17:24,681 --> 00:17:27,020
No, the cap fell off of mine.

709
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,160
But your cap is staying in?

710
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,993
- Yeah.

711
00:17:28,993 --> 00:17:30,130
- Lemme see if I can just kind of juice it, like this.

712
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:31,430
Oh. - Mine's leaking, though,

713
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:32,263
but yeah.

714
00:17:32,263 --> 00:17:33,280
- All right, this one was definitely a fail.

715
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,510
I guess we're on to the next one.

716
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,850
We've got the slime erasers, and now,

717
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:37,340
let's actually see if these work.

718
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,020
What is the ideal shape, you think, for this?

719
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,830
- I don't know, it's like a kneaded eraser.

720
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,660
- A what? Like, you need an eraser?

721
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,493
- What? No.

722
00:17:43,493 --> 00:17:44,760
- If you're gonna go for a thinner one,

723
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,388
I'm just gonna go for a giant chunk of it.

724
00:17:46,388 --> 00:17:47,570
All right, here we go, ready?

725
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:48,853
- [Both] Set, go.

726
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:51,470
- Oh! - No way!

727
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,303
- It actually works.

728
00:17:52,303 --> 00:17:54,254
- Dude, it works on the colored pencil, too, bro.

729
00:17:54,254 --> 00:17:55,410
- No way.

730
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:57,730
- It's not fully gone, but it is totally working.

731
00:17:57,730 --> 00:17:59,210
Oh, my gosh.

732
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,376
I cannot believe this worked.

733
00:18:00,376 --> 00:18:02,830
Comment down below, what color eraser do you wanna make?

734
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:03,663
And right now, we're on to the next one.

735
00:18:03,663 --> 00:18:05,440
Let's see if it turned purple.

736
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,780
- [Both] Three, two, one.

737
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:09,260
- Oh, my gosh. - What?

738
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,450
- Why is it not purple?

739
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:12,140
- Wait, did you grab the wrong one?

740
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,730
- I grabbed the wrong watermelon.

741
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:14,563
Let's go grab the right one, but.

742
00:18:14,563 --> 00:18:15,850
- How did you do that?

743
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:16,683
- It still tastes good.

744
00:18:16,683 --> 00:18:17,610
I've got the right melon, and dude,

745
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:19,280
you can already tell it's getting colored on the inside.

746
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,707
- Dude, I know, I can't wait to see the inside of this, bro.

747
00:18:21,707 --> 00:18:22,700
- The real question though,

748
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,970
is has it made its way all the way through the melon,

749
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:25,803
to color the whole thing?

750
00:18:25,803 --> 00:18:27,780
Best way to find out is to cut a little slice

751
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:28,613
out of the side of it.

752
00:18:28,613 --> 00:18:29,446
All right, we're gonna cut out the slice,

753
00:18:29,446 --> 00:18:30,279
and if you do this at home,

754
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:32,090
be very careful when using knives.

755
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:33,090
Just gonna put it right here.

756
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:34,050
Oh, man, it's a little bit stuck.

757
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:35,140
- I think I got it, I think I got it.

758
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,760
- I'm gonna have more of a watermelon square

759
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,250
than I am actually a little slice of it.

760
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,083
I gotta be honest.

761
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:40,260
All right, time to stick the craft sticks in it,

762
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,200
and see if these actually change colors, man.

763
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,380
- Do you got it? - No!

764
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,640
All right, here we go with the big reveal.

765
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,510
Time to see if it actually changed colors.

766
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,420
Here we go. Three.

767
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,253
- [Both] Two. - Oh, wait.

768
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:50,240
- Oh, yeah, if you wanna win a 15 minute video call,

769
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,850
with Devan and I, text the word LIFE to 81800, right now.

770
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:56,370
So pause the video, text the word LIFE to 81800.

771
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:57,980
You'll automatically be entered in to win.

772
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,470
And right now, let's see if this works, ready?

773
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:00,303
Here we go.

774
00:19:00,303 --> 00:19:02,726
- [Both] Ready, set, go. Oh!

775
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:03,559
- Dude, it worked.

776
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:04,620
I can't believe it.

777
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,617
Dude, even on the inside, and everything, dude.

778
00:19:06,617 --> 00:19:07,450
- All right, then. - All right,

779
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:08,283
here's the real question, Devan.

780
00:19:08,283 --> 00:19:09,530
- Yeah? - How does it taste?

781
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:10,363
- Oh, no.

782
00:19:10,363 --> 00:19:11,730
- These are gonna taste gross, like, just smell it.

783
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:13,332
See how it smells. - Ugh. Smells cabbage.

784
00:19:13,332 --> 00:19:14,604
- Does it smell good? - No.

785
00:19:14,604 --> 00:19:15,437
- It smells like cabbage?

786
00:19:15,437 --> 00:19:16,270
Three.

787
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,890
- [Both] Two, one.

788
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:18,762
- That's it?

789
00:19:18,762 --> 00:19:19,595
- Ugh.

790
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,493
- Doesn't taste good? - Not really.

791
00:19:22,493 --> 00:19:23,326
- Does it kinda taste good?

792
00:19:23,326 --> 00:19:25,210
Maybe the flavors combining together? No?

793
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:26,043
- Nope.

794
00:19:26,043 --> 00:19:26,876
- You get to comment down below.

795
00:19:26,876 --> 00:19:27,720
What is your favorite food

796
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,050
we should use in a life hack video?

797
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:30,500
Click over here if you wanna see another video,

798
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,333
you have five seconds.

799
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:32,310
Here we go, five.

800
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:35,450
- [Both] Four, three, two, one, done.

801
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:36,760
- Love you. - Bye.

802
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,887
- This is not a carnival, this is mount shaquana.

803
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:40,730
I forgot the name again.

804
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:41,760
Time to get in here with the hands

805
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,350
and really make some great-looking art.

806
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,360
So this is pure shaving cream.

807
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,830
It feels like a cloud.

808
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,700
- I would just do one of the squeegees over the top,

809
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,533
and be done.

810
00:19:49,533 --> 00:19:51,230
- Why use a squeegee when you can use a hand-weegee?

811
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,480
- Because it's- ha.

812
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,454
Look at that.

813
00:19:53,454 --> 00:19:54,770
- Does that look smea-yeah, that looks smeared.

814
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:55,603
- That looks really smeared.

815
00:19:55,603 --> 00:19:56,680
Look at your hand, dude.

816
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,170
- Oh, no!

817
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:00,393
Here we go, just gotta weegee, weegee, weegee, weegee.
