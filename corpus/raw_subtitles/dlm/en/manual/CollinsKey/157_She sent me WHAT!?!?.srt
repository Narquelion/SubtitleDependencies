00:00:00,221 --> 00:00:02,804
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:19,124 --> 00:00:21,446
(brushing)

3
00:00:21,446 --> 00:00:23,613
(beeping)

4
00:00:27,906 --> 00:00:30,156
(laughing)

5
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:33,872
- [Carla] Collins?

6
00:00:33,872 --> 00:00:34,705
Collins?

7
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:36,923
Collins?

8
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:39,549
- What, I'm just trying to figure

9
00:00:39,549 --> 00:00:41,499
out why would she create an Instagram

10
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:43,286
account and then not reply to my DM's.

11
00:00:43,286 --> 00:00:44,119
(sighs)

12
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:47,378
- Oh, you're obsessing over that girl.

13
00:00:47,378 --> 00:00:49,746
Look, Jacob has date tonight, with

14
00:00:49,746 --> 00:00:52,219
the cute boy, don't you?

15
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:53,089
- You didn't tell me bro what's up?

16
00:00:53,089 --> 00:00:56,506
- I think it's a date, yes I think it is.

17
00:00:57,425 --> 00:01:00,553
Guys we were in improv reading poetry,

18
00:01:00,553 --> 00:01:02,422
and I told a joke about Chaucer

19
00:01:02,422 --> 00:01:04,262
and he laughed and it wasn't funny.

20
00:01:04,262 --> 00:01:05,382
I know it wasn't.

21
00:01:05,382 --> 00:01:07,663
- Oh, crap, I totally forgot, Eddie's

22
00:01:07,663 --> 00:01:10,060
taking me out for dunch.

23
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:11,418
- Dunch?

24
00:01:11,418 --> 00:01:13,212
- Yeah, it's the meal, you know,

25
00:01:13,212 --> 00:01:16,410
before dinner and between lunch and dinner?

26
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,513
Dunch!

27
00:01:17,513 --> 00:01:18,540
(laughs)

28
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,373
- What?

29
00:01:19,373 --> 00:01:20,461
- [Carla] Screw you guys all!

30
00:01:20,461 --> 00:01:21,425
- It's not a word.

31
00:01:21,425 --> 00:01:22,469
- [Collins] Enjoy your dunch!

32
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:23,302
(laughs)

33
00:01:23,302 --> 00:01:24,280
- [Jacob] That's so fake!

34
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,122
- It's real.

35
00:01:25,122 --> 00:01:25,955
- [Jacob] He lied to you.

36
00:01:25,955 --> 00:01:26,933
- [Collins] Yeah enjoy your dunch!

37
00:01:26,933 --> 00:01:27,766
- Thank you, bye!

38
00:01:27,766 --> 00:01:30,016
- [Jacob] It's a fake meal!

39
00:01:34,408 --> 00:01:35,482
- [Martin] Oh they are gonna love

40
00:01:35,482 --> 00:01:37,333
this trick, I cant wait for them to see it man!

41
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:39,591
It is so good, it's so sexy, you know.

42
00:01:39,591 --> 00:01:43,259
And I don't see cards as a sexy thing,

43
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:44,861
you know mean, like ever.

44
00:01:44,861 --> 00:01:46,330
Never had anybody, well I play cards

45
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:48,309
with my grandma so it's never been sexy.

46
00:01:48,309 --> 00:01:50,421
But you, you make it sexy!

47
00:01:50,421 --> 00:01:51,254
See, see.

48
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:53,570
- What?

49
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:54,461
- Are you paying attention to me right now?

50
00:01:54,461 --> 00:01:55,517
- The eyes thing, yeah, yeah.

51
00:01:55,517 --> 00:01:56,852
- Say sex yeah!

52
00:01:56,852 --> 00:01:57,685
- Sex, yeah, we're gonna kill it.

53
00:01:57,685 --> 00:01:59,017
- Come on man, this is a big step up, man.

54
00:01:59,017 --> 00:01:59,940
You gotta be pumped about this.

55
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,275
- No, I'm super pumped!

56
00:02:01,275 --> 00:02:02,610
- You do not sound super pumped,

57
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,241
you sound average pumped.

58
00:02:04,241 --> 00:02:05,239
- Super pumped!

59
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:06,072
- There we go!

60
00:02:06,072 --> 00:02:06,905
- Yeah!

61
00:02:06,905 --> 00:02:09,424
- What's on your mind, what's wrong?

62
00:02:09,424 --> 00:02:10,283
- Like this is such an amazing

63
00:02:10,283 --> 00:02:12,041
opportunity and the last thing I want

64
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:13,161
is for them to last minute, switch

65
00:02:13,161 --> 00:02:13,994
it up and want to put me in that

66
00:02:13,994 --> 00:02:16,209
stereotypical, like creepy, weird, magician thing.

67
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:17,549
Like that is not me at all, like I don't

68
00:02:17,549 --> 00:02:18,826
want to be put in that box, I want

69
00:02:18,826 --> 00:02:21,682
to be able to do my own thing, but yeah.

70
00:02:21,682 --> 00:02:24,962
- Right, guess who understands?

71
00:02:24,962 --> 00:02:25,982
- You, yeah.

72
00:02:25,982 --> 00:02:26,815
- That's exactly right!

73
00:02:26,815 --> 00:02:27,648
Who am I Collins, who am I?

74
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:29,169
- You're Martin.

75
00:02:29,169 --> 00:02:30,002
- Martin the man!

76
00:02:30,002 --> 00:02:30,835
- Martin the man.

77
00:02:30,835 --> 00:02:32,228
- That's exactly right, I got your back, man!

78
00:02:32,228 --> 00:02:34,648
Like bra straps, bacne, that's back pimples!

79

Hit 'em our game, okay?

Open the game up, hit 'em with the game.

00:02:50,705 --> 00:02:53,517
No man harder than that!

94
00:02:55,304 --> 00:02:56,137

(banging and cheering)

97
00:02:58,404 --> 00:03:00,023
Whoa buddy, no!

98
00:03:00,023 --> 00:03:01,602
Don't do that to my car!

00:03:01,602 --> 00:03:03,488
Look, we gon' open some doors alright?

00:03:05,397 --> 00:03:08,314
(upbeat pop music)

102
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:28,518
(cheering)

103
00:03:28,518 --> 00:03:30,768
(laughing)

104
00:03:32,738 --> 00:03:33,571
- We really appreciate you coming

105
00:03:33,571 --> 00:03:34,973
in today Collins, just so we can get

106
00:03:34,973 --> 00:03:37,213
those final little nuances into the script.

107
00:03:37,213 --> 00:03:38,345
You know, just get to the heart of

108
00:03:38,345 --> 00:03:40,405
who Collins Key really is.

109
00:03:40,405 --> 00:03:41,781
- And we got you a great stylist!

110
00:03:41,781 --> 00:03:43,464
- You're gonna die!

111
00:03:43,464 --> 00:03:45,356
- We're very thrilled for this transition,

112
00:03:45,356 --> 00:03:46,256
ain't that right Collins?

113
00:03:46,256 --> 00:03:47,190
- Yeah.

114
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,023
- Collins!

115
00:03:48,023 --> 00:03:48,856
- Yes!

116
00:03:48,856 --> 00:03:49,689
- See you on set!

117
00:03:49,689 --> 00:03:51,148

118
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:52,622
- Alright.

119
00:03:52,622 --> 00:03:54,120
- Killed it in there boy!

120
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,089
- That was awesome, that was great!

121
00:03:55,089 --> 00:03:56,227
- Did you see their faces, they were like.

122
00:03:56,227 --> 00:03:57,283
(gasps)

123
00:03:57,283 --> 00:03:59,297
- They were freaking out, that was for sure bro.

124
00:03:59,297 --> 00:04:00,835
- That's how you do it.

125
00:04:00,835 --> 00:04:02,611
- I think like they finally get it,

126
00:04:02,611 --> 00:04:04,184
like what we want to do with it, so, so.

127
00:04:04,184 --> 00:04:06,308
- Yeah, man, and you hit 'em with that magic

128
00:04:06,308 --> 00:04:09,229
and they caught it, they caught it.

129
00:04:09,229 --> 00:04:10,824
- [Jacob] Like if you're straight,

130
00:04:10,824 --> 00:04:14,126
that's cool, but tell me before I pay for dinner.

131
00:04:14,126 --> 00:04:15,751
- Yeah, at least your date didn't

132
00:04:15,751 --> 00:04:17,475
end in the parking lot watching your

133
00:04:17,475 --> 00:04:19,994
boyfriend and his crew land 360 flips.

134
00:04:19,994 --> 00:04:21,770
- Wake up girl, he does that every time,

135
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:23,302
and he never lands them.

136
00:04:23,302 --> 00:04:24,318
(sighs)

137
00:04:24,318 --> 00:04:26,733
- He asked me to move in.

138
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,787
- Again, what'd you say?

139
00:04:28,787 --> 00:04:29,640
- You guys!

140
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,473
- Carla's moving in with Eddie!

141
00:04:30,473 --> 00:04:31,353
- No, I'm not!

142
00:04:31,353 --> 00:04:33,333
- No, she posted!

143
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:34,416
- Wait, what?

144
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,405
You have 120 hours, come find me!

145
00:04:39,405 --> 00:04:40,334
- What does that mean?

146
00:04:40,334 --> 00:04:42,667
- I don't know, but it's a clue!

147
00:04:42,667 --> 00:04:46,688
- A keyhole, I'm detecting a theme here.

148
00:04:46,688 --> 00:04:51,499
- I'm gonna post this, someones gotta know what it means!

149
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:53,832
(pop music)
