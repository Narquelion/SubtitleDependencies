1
00:00:00,148 --> 00:00:01,228
- Hey guys, it's Collins,

2
00:00:01,228 --> 00:00:02,540
right now I'm in the middle of nowhere

3
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:04,386
and we're gonna try to catch some Pokémon together.

4
00:00:04,386 --> 00:00:06,116
I've heard there's some super rare ones around here,

5
00:00:06,116 --> 00:00:07,138
so let's give this a shot.

6
00:00:07,138 --> 00:00:10,055
(video game music)

7
00:00:17,269 --> 00:00:18,173
We're gonna need a bigger ball.

8
00:00:18,173 --> 00:00:19,006
(record scratching)

9
00:00:19,006 --> 00:00:19,839
- Oh, no!

10
00:00:20,953 --> 00:00:22,113
Oh! (bleep)

11
00:00:22,113 --> 00:00:23,437
- What's up? It's Collins Key.

12
00:00:23,437 --> 00:00:24,368
And for today's video,

13
00:00:24,368 --> 00:00:27,491
we are gonna be creating a giant DIY edible PokéBall.

14
00:00:27,491 --> 00:00:29,465
Now this was all inspired, obviously,

15
00:00:29,465 --> 00:00:30,916
by the Pokémon-Go craze that is literally happening

16
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:33,145
across the world right now, and I thought, "you know what?

17
00:00:33,145 --> 00:00:35,641
Why not make a giant edible PokéBall

18
00:00:35,641 --> 00:00:37,673
and then try to catch some real life Pokémon with it?"

19
00:00:37,673 --> 00:00:39,333
If you want me to do even more DIY videos,

20
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:40,947
let me know by liking this video

21
00:00:40,947 --> 00:00:42,155
and if this video gets enough thumbs up,

22
00:00:42,155 --> 00:00:44,593
then in the future I will do more videos just like this

23
00:00:44,593 --> 00:00:45,998
and also, I'm doing a huge give away

24
00:00:45,998 --> 00:00:46,868
on my channel right now.

25
00:00:46,868 --> 00:00:48,830
I'm giving away a MacBook, so if you wanna win that,

26
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:51,698
let me know by liking this video, comment down below:

27
00:00:51,698 --> 00:00:52,531
What is your favorite video

28
00:00:52,531 --> 00:00:53,605
I've ever posted on this channel?

29
00:00:53,605 --> 00:00:55,883
Of course, you must be subscribed to this channel.

30
00:00:55,883 --> 00:00:57,779
Without any further ado, let's jump in right now.

31
00:00:57,779 --> 00:01:00,577
Let's create a giant DIY edible PokéBall.

32
00:01:00,577 --> 00:01:02,295
Alright, guys, to get it started, here's what you need:

33
00:01:02,295 --> 00:01:04,817
Measuring cups, cake mix, eggs, oil, cream cheese,

34
00:01:04,817 --> 00:01:07,116
fondant, fondant roller, edible black spray paint,

35
00:01:07,116 --> 00:01:09,299
because I could not find black fondant.

36
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:10,948
So, here's the game plan of how we're gonna make this.

37
00:01:10,948 --> 00:01:12,132
We're first gonna bake a cake,

38
00:01:12,132 --> 00:01:14,152
then we're gonna stack it and layer it,

39
00:01:14,152 --> 00:01:15,661
from there we're gonna shave the whole thing down

40
00:01:15,661 --> 00:01:17,484
into a ball shape, and last, but not least,

41
00:01:17,484 --> 00:01:19,330
we're gonna decorate it to look like a PokéBall.

42
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:21,749
Step number one is bake the cake.

43
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:23,835
Alright, so we're gonna open up the cake mix first.

44
00:01:23,835 --> 00:01:25,657
Oh! I almost spilled it everywhere.

45
00:01:25,657 --> 00:01:28,479
That was close, dump it out.

46
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,452
I think we're gonna need a bigger bowl.

47
00:01:30,452 --> 00:01:31,288
Packet number two.

48
00:01:31,288 --> 00:01:32,972
Now I do understand that I'm using a lot of cake mix

49
00:01:32,972 --> 00:01:35,131
for this, but that's because I wanna make a giant PokéBall.

50
00:01:35,131 --> 00:01:36,362
So, the bigger, the better.

51
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:37,662
Next up, we are going to be adding eggs,

52
00:01:37,662 --> 00:01:39,102
there we go, that's one egg.

53
00:01:39,102 --> 00:01:42,004
We now have two eggs, and three.

54
00:01:42,004 --> 00:01:43,165
Oh, no! I just cracked it.

55
00:01:43,165 --> 00:01:46,012
Oh, yep, it definitely cracked, let me just use my spoon,

56
00:01:46,012 --> 00:01:48,500
get the egg out of there, and we're good.

57
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,207
Egg number two I'm going to try to crack with nothing more

58
00:01:50,207 --> 00:01:52,099
than a flick of the finger.

59
00:01:52,099 --> 00:01:54,154
Ouch! It worked, but that hurt a lot,

60
00:01:54,154 --> 00:01:55,257
and it shot all the way over here.

61
00:01:55,257 --> 00:01:56,697
There we go, that's egg number two.

62
00:01:56,697 --> 00:01:57,776
I'm gonna try to crack egg number three

63
00:01:57,776 --> 00:01:58,891
with egg number four.

64
00:01:58,891 --> 00:02:01,503
(eggs crack)

65
00:02:01,503 --> 00:02:05,851
I'm gonna use the blunt end of the cup to crack the egg.

66
00:02:05,851 --> 00:02:07,012
It worked!

67
00:02:07,012 --> 00:02:09,090
I'm not gonna say I'm like an innovative chef right now,

68
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,110
but I'm finding brand new ways to crack eggs.

69
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:13,281
I think that's worth a Nobel Prize or something there, man.

70
00:02:13,281 --> 00:02:14,114
For this final egg,

71
00:02:14,114 --> 00:02:15,696
I'm gonna use a cardboard box to crack it.

72
00:02:15,696 --> 00:02:16,529
This is unprecedented

73
00:02:16,529 --> 00:02:18,331
in the egg-cracking community right now.

74
00:02:18,331 --> 00:02:21,280
I don't think this has ever been attempted, so, yeah.

75
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,146
(box bangs against egg)

76
00:02:25,146 --> 00:02:26,540
I got this.

77
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,873
(box bangs against egg)

78
00:02:36,571 --> 00:02:37,511
Switch sides

79
00:02:37,511 --> 00:02:39,073
(box bangs against egg)

80
00:02:39,073 --> 00:02:41,990
(video game music)

81
00:02:43,508 --> 00:02:45,400
Well, I gotta say it worked.

82
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,173
Um, man, I cannot just be basic with eggs.

83
00:02:49,173 --> 00:02:50,532
That is one thing you guys have learned.

84
00:02:50,532 --> 00:02:52,296
I wonder how this tastes.

85
00:02:52,296 --> 00:02:53,129
Urgh!

86
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:54,998
After the recent excitement of adding all those eggs,

87
00:02:54,998 --> 00:02:56,693
I have a feeling that the vegetable oil

88
00:02:56,693 --> 00:02:57,924
is not going to be nearly as exciting,

89
00:02:57,924 --> 00:02:58,885
so I'm literally going to fast-forward

90
00:02:58,885 --> 00:03:00,115
through this part right now.

91
00:03:00,115 --> 00:03:03,146
(speedy music)

92
00:03:03,146 --> 00:03:05,282
Like I predicted, that was absolutely boring,

93
00:03:05,282 --> 00:03:06,582
for both you and I.

94
00:03:06,582 --> 00:03:10,190
Next step, that actually worked, is to mix it all up.

95
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,132
So, I've never really whisked a cake before,

96
00:03:12,132 --> 00:03:15,464
but I think you just kinda do this?

97
00:03:15,464 --> 00:03:16,411
I don't know.

98
00:03:16,411 --> 00:03:17,911
Alright, well, um,

99
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:21,817
I gotta admit, this is kinda just like,

100
00:03:21,817 --> 00:03:23,652
not looking like cakey at all.

101
00:03:23,652 --> 00:03:25,173
Is this like what baking is really like?

102
00:03:25,173 --> 00:03:26,241
I always thought it was like fun,

103
00:03:26,241 --> 00:03:28,238
it was like throwing flour everywhere, but this is,

104
00:03:28,238 --> 00:03:29,071
this is not fun.

105
00:03:29,071 --> 00:03:30,420
This cake is not mixing very well at all,

106
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,475
it's always like stuck in the middle of my whisk

107
00:03:32,475 --> 00:03:34,159
and that's where the majority of it is

108
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,876
and the rest is all this like weird slimy.

109
00:03:36,876 --> 00:03:40,376
(whisk taps against bowl)

110
00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:47,592
It's actually mixing though, hey!

111
00:03:47,592 --> 00:03:49,472
Okay, yeah, it's starting to look better.

112
00:03:49,472 --> 00:03:50,622
I need to take a break.

113
00:03:50,622 --> 00:03:53,208
Okay, I'm done. Give me one second.

114
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:55,019
Alright, we're good to go, here we go.

115
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:56,436
Oh my gosh, okay.

116
00:03:57,562 --> 00:03:59,779
- [Narrator] One eternity later.

117
00:03:59,779 --> 00:04:00,650
- Now that it's all mixed,

118
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,867
it's time to dump it into the pan.

119
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:06,799
There we so, this is gonna be a lot of cake.

120
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,332
Don't lose the spoon, oh, that was so close.

121
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:09,737
Yeah, next we're gonna back the cake.

122
00:04:09,737 --> 00:04:10,570
- [Narrator] Later

123
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:11,418
- As you guys can tell by the fact that

124
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:14,262
it's gotten rather dark outside, the cake is finally baked

125
00:04:14,262 --> 00:04:16,433
and now it's time to create the layers.

126
00:04:16,433 --> 00:04:17,266
So, to make this easier,

127
00:04:17,266 --> 00:04:19,185
I cut out a piece of paper in a circle shape.

128
00:04:19,185 --> 00:04:21,565
That way, I can put it over here, cut out one circle here,

129
00:04:21,565 --> 00:04:23,446
one circle here, and then a half-circle

130
00:04:23,446 --> 00:04:24,607
and another half-circle.

131
00:04:24,607 --> 00:04:25,756
So, we're gonna do this right now.

132
00:04:25,756 --> 00:04:27,364
I'm pretty nervous about this,

133
00:04:27,364 --> 00:04:29,047
I really wanna get this DIY right,

134
00:04:29,047 --> 00:04:30,638
so I'm so nervous to mess this up.

135
00:04:30,638 --> 00:04:34,620
Getting close to my hand, don't wanna cut it.

136
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,769
That turned out really well!

137
00:04:35,769 --> 00:04:38,091
Okay, I'm excited, I'm getting more and more excited

138
00:04:38,091 --> 00:04:40,320
as this goes on, this is gonna turn out so well.

139
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,586
So, now that I've cut out the outlines,

140
00:04:41,586 --> 00:04:43,443
I'm not exactly sure how to remove them

141
00:04:43,443 --> 00:04:44,871
without really destroying the whole thing,

142
00:04:44,871 --> 00:04:45,858
so there's gonna be

143
00:04:45,858 --> 00:04:47,008
a little be of trial and error right now.

144
00:04:47,008 --> 00:04:49,388
I'm gonna see if I can remove all the stuff around it first.

145
00:04:49,388 --> 00:04:51,617
Alright, here we go, the moment of truth.

146
00:04:51,617 --> 00:04:53,034
So nervous, okay,

147
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,176
this is going to be so legit!

148
00:04:58,176 --> 00:04:59,661
Yo, I'm being like so careful right now,

149
00:04:59,661 --> 00:05:02,350
'cause I don't wanna like mess this up, okay, there we go.

150
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:05,078
I'm so hyped right now! Oh my gosh!

151
00:05:05,078 --> 00:05:08,074
Last, but not least, the two pieces coming together,

152
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:10,825
finish it off, we'll go one right there,

153
00:05:10,825 --> 00:05:14,239
Oh my gosh, first of all this is the first cake

154
00:05:14,239 --> 00:05:16,003
I've literally ever baked in my entire life

155
00:05:16,003 --> 00:05:17,025
and look at how it turned out!

156
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,541
And there's like little gingerbread things,

157
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:19,374
well these aren't gingerbread things,

158
00:05:19,374 --> 00:05:20,859
but there's these things too, yay!

159
00:05:20,859 --> 00:05:23,026
Okay, here we go, hold on.

160
00:05:25,003 --> 00:05:26,118
It's amazing.

161
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:27,499
Now, we're gonna use that cream cheese frosting

162
00:05:27,499 --> 00:05:29,837
to glue this cake together, so that's the next step.

163
00:05:29,837 --> 00:05:31,699
But, that catch though.

164
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:34,741
Well, another interesting part of the video.

165
00:05:34,741 --> 00:05:36,532
I literally have nothing interesting to say about this,

166
00:05:36,532 --> 00:05:39,216
like at all, like nothing is coming to mind, hmm...

167
00:05:39,216 --> 00:05:40,284
That wasn't fun.

168
00:05:40,284 --> 00:05:41,824
Alright, now, the moment of truth,

169
00:05:41,824 --> 00:05:43,103
get these layers to glue together,

170
00:05:43,103 --> 00:05:44,844
so there we go, boom right on top of each other.

171
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,086
Yeah, I would say that works out pretty well,

172
00:05:46,086 --> 00:05:49,221
now it's time to glue these two layers to that layer.

173
00:05:49,221 --> 00:05:50,730
And we're back again for the most interesting

174
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,576
part of the video, round two.

175
00:05:52,576 --> 00:05:56,743
Alright, so here we go, half number one and half number two.

176
00:05:58,126 --> 00:05:59,600
There we go, perfect.

177
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,771
Now onto the next step, which is shaping the cake.

178
00:06:01,771 --> 00:06:03,455
Once you've created the shape of the PokéBall,

179
00:06:03,455 --> 00:06:05,556
now it's time to add the cream cheese frosting

180
00:06:05,556 --> 00:06:06,926
to the outside of it.

181
00:06:06,926 --> 00:06:09,028
We are almost there and the next step right now

182
00:06:09,028 --> 00:06:09,887
is with the fondant.

183
00:06:09,887 --> 00:06:12,511
I'm just gonna roll it out and create the PokéBall.

184
00:06:12,511 --> 00:06:15,386
We are literally at the final stages.

185
00:06:15,386 --> 00:06:16,219
Mwah!

186
00:06:16,219 --> 00:06:17,535
I've never really worked with this stuff before

187
00:06:17,535 --> 00:06:20,785
and it's like a, ow, it's like a brick.

188
00:06:24,597 --> 00:06:26,166
(fondant thumps on the counter)

189
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:26,999
What?

190
00:06:26,999 --> 00:06:28,467
It smells just like Play-Doh too,

191
00:06:28,467 --> 00:06:29,860
which is the most disgusting part.

192
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,416
Luckily, we've got a roller here,

193
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:33,471
so I guess we can use this to, I don't know,

194
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,457
roll this stuff out?

195
00:06:34,457 --> 00:06:35,851
Just go for it I guess, I don't know.

196
00:06:35,851 --> 00:06:40,019
Alright, here we go, so we're gonna cut it in half first.

197
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:41,365
Oh! This stuff is solid.

198
00:06:41,365 --> 00:06:43,258
Holy cow, okay, this stuff is really disgusting.

199
00:06:43,258 --> 00:06:46,961
Is this edible? I don't think, this can't be edible.

200
00:06:46,961 --> 00:06:50,201
Oh! This is not easy, no, this is like folding on itself.

201
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,871
This stuff is not easy to work with, that is for sure.

202
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:53,730
The whole chair is like turning

203
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:55,123
as I'm trying to spread this stuff out.

204
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,807
This is not easy at all.

205
00:06:56,807 --> 00:06:58,862
Okay, I'm gonna try to channel my frustrations right now

206
00:06:58,862 --> 00:07:00,708
into creating this fondant better.

207
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:02,298
Alright, so after years and years of work

208
00:07:02,298 --> 00:07:03,250
to roll this thing out,

209
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,468
now it's time to place the red on the PokéBall.

210
00:07:05,468 --> 00:07:09,229
So, we're gonna place it on the back here.

211
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:13,711
Yo! This is going to look so sick, oh my gosh!

212
00:07:13,711 --> 00:07:16,927
Okay, there we go, part number one is done.

213
00:07:16,927 --> 00:07:19,493
Now it's time to smooth it all out and make it look good.

214
00:07:19,493 --> 00:07:20,932
But, this is looking dope.

215
00:07:20,932 --> 00:07:22,604
Alright, now it's time to take the white fondant

216
00:07:22,604 --> 00:07:24,009
and put it on.

217
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:28,027
This PokéBall is coming together so well, oh my gosh.

218
00:07:28,027 --> 00:07:29,085
Yo-o-o-o!

219
00:07:29,085 --> 00:07:29,918
Yes, yes.

220
00:07:32,233 --> 00:07:33,919
And now for the finishing touches, which is that black band

221
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:34,952
that goes around the PokéBall.

222
00:07:34,952 --> 00:07:36,891
So, I had to spray paint some of the white fondant

223
00:07:36,891 --> 00:07:38,784
because I don't have any black fondant, but here we go,

224
00:07:38,784 --> 00:07:40,653
let's give this a shot.

225
00:07:40,653 --> 00:07:42,383
Oh! No, no, no!

226
00:07:42,383 --> 00:07:43,254
That was a lot more difficult

227
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,087
than I initially had anticipated.

228
00:07:44,087 --> 00:07:46,121
Bam! Things are coming together.

229
00:07:46,121 --> 00:07:48,482
The moment you've all been waiting for, the big reveal,

230
00:07:48,482 --> 00:07:49,982
here we go, 3-2-1!

231
00:07:51,586 --> 00:07:53,723
Yo! Like it actually turned out so well.

232
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,685
So, right now, I've got my real-life PokéBall

233
00:07:55,685 --> 00:07:58,353
and all I need to do is just catch a real-life Pokémon.

234
00:07:58,353 --> 00:07:59,186
(ball hits Pokémon) - Oh!

235
00:07:59,186 --> 00:08:01,133
