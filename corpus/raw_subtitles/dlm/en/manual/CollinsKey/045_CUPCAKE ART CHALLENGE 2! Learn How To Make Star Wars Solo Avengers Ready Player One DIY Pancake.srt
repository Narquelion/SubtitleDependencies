1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,660
- [Both] Cupcake challenge!

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:02,831
- [Devin] Boom!

3
00:00:02,831 --> 00:00:05,200
- Whew, my gosh you challenged us to another cupcake art

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,410
challenge and right, now let's go!

5
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:08,243
- Is it good?

6
00:00:08,243 --> 00:00:09,076
- Oh man this is good.

7
00:00:09,076 --> 00:00:10,100
- For this round, as you can tell,

8
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,590
we've got way more cupcakes, so right now we are making

9
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:13,650
Wreck-It Ralph. - Whew!

10
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:14,483
I dropped it.

11
00:00:14,483 --> 00:00:15,810
First thing, we must assemble the shape

12
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:16,643
of Wreck-It Ralph. - Yes

13
00:00:16,643 --> 00:00:17,760
- So we're gonna go boom.

14
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,593
Ba-da-boom-boom-boom-boom.

15
00:00:18,593 --> 00:00:20,383
Now, it's time to decorate Wreck-It Ralph.

16
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:22,773
Shouldn't have done that.

17
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:23,957
I was trying to be like Wreck-It Ralph,

18
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:25,200
and just like break the internet, ya know, but nope.

19
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,480
Two eyeballs, bam.

20
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,459
Oh man, he looks very upset right now.

21
00:00:28,459 --> 00:00:29,292
(laughs)

22
00:00:29,292 --> 00:00:30,430
I will give him a big ol' mouth.

23
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,480
He'll be wrecking some food with his mouth.

24
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,916
Oh gosh, it looks so scary!

25
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:35,010
(exaggerated moan)

26
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,110
- Alright, got two of his shoulders done.

27
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,510
- Dude, what the fu-?

28
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:40,280
My dude's got massive teeth.

29
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,080
Wreck-It Ralph has got buckteeth.

30
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,430
Oh look at that nice shirt.

31
00:00:44,337 --> 00:00:45,170
- Alright, here we go.

32
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,820
We got arm number one. Boop.

33
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:47,734
I don't want Devan's...

34
00:00:47,734 --> 00:00:48,567
(tube squeaks)

35
00:00:48,567 --> 00:00:49,790
You good?

36
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,745
Oh there it goes again, dude.

37
00:00:51,745 --> 00:00:53,070
(Electronic music)

38
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,420
Yo, yours is looking, not good, Devin.

39
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,400
- Haters gonna hate.

40
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,233
- I'm not hatin', I'm just,

41
00:00:57,233 --> 00:00:58,160
Yeah, I'm hatin'.

42
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,070
Because that was my spoon.

43
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:00,260
Well, I'm gonna get a spoon right now,

44
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,319
so whoo-papa!

45
00:01:01,319 --> 00:01:02,513
Bam! A spoon.

46
00:01:02,513 --> 00:01:03,920
Man, it got stuck to the spoon.

47
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,450
It's just coming straight off my cupcake.

48
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:08,620
- See, only a skilled spoon handler can handle this.

49
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,350
So much concentration is taking place at the moment.

50
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,183
- I can tell.

51
00:01:11,183 --> 00:01:12,630
Collin just went quiet.

52
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:13,844
- Very true, I live with him.

53
00:01:13,844 --> 00:01:16,578
(electronic music)

54
00:01:16,578 --> 00:01:18,230
- Yo, no, no, no! Dude my icings running out.

55
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:19,063
- Oh no!

56
00:01:19,063 --> 00:01:19,896
- Please, can I finish the hand?

57
00:01:19,896 --> 00:01:20,760
Please, please, please, please, please yes!

58
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,640
Made it, bam!

59
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,440
Now, time to detail his hands and feet,

60
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,530
because we need to get some fingers.

61
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:25,540
We got to have him do hand signs,

62
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:26,889
like yo what's up, peace

63
00:01:26,889 --> 00:01:27,722
- Whoa.

64
00:01:27,722 --> 00:01:29,420
- His eyes are like so close together.

65
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,980
He can only see one thing.

66
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,810
I gotta give my guy some toes, some big ol' toes.

67
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:34,750
Look, he looks like a duck with

68
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,100
some like flippers or something.

69
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,530
Man, I did not get the toes right.

70
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:38,660
- Oh, no!

71
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:39,830
This is even worse!

72
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:40,850
Oh my goodness!

73
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,070
- Yo, that's actually low-key kind of terrifying.

74
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,870
- Alright, so now I have to go in and add the nose.

75
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,593
No! No! - That is not working!

76
00:01:46,593 --> 00:01:47,530
(aggravated puffs)

77
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,450
- Hopefully it falls in the right spot.

78
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:50,670
No!

79
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:51,970
- Dude, you got it on his eyebrow.

80
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:53,670
You can't have a nose on the brow.

81
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:54,503
Replace it.

82
00:01:54,503 --> 00:01:55,336
- Yep, oh!

83
00:01:55,336 --> 00:01:56,360
Congratulations.

84
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,193
- Wow!

85
00:01:57,193 --> 00:01:58,146
That looks really bad.

86
00:01:58,146 --> 00:01:58,979
Yo!

87
00:01:58,979 --> 00:01:59,812
The big reveal, here we go.

88
00:01:59,812 --> 00:02:01,410
Three, two, one!

89
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:02,440
Ta-Da!

90
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,070
- These are the Wreck-It Ralph-

91
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,900
I think I may have nailed this round,

92
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,250
but you get to comment down below

93
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,600
and let us know who you think won

94
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,287
so right now, guys, it's on to the next round.

95
00:02:10,287 --> 00:02:12,270
For this one you challenged us to do

96
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,810
Mario from Mario Odyssey.

97
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:14,643
Alright, go!

98
00:02:14,643 --> 00:02:16,031
- Okay, what do I, Oh!

99
00:02:16,031 --> 00:02:16,864
(zip sound)

100
00:02:16,864 --> 00:02:17,760
Dude really! (laughs)

101
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,652
I think I'm gonna go pink with his face.

102
00:02:19,652 --> 00:02:20,485
- Pink?

103
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:25,510
(vocalises)

104
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:28,310
- Next up we got some baby blue, oh my gosh!

105
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,520
This stuff looks really cool.

106
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,990
This is like jelly, almost.

107
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,010
Yo, Mario looks like he's buggin'.

108
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,913
He's got his hat on like, he's like, 'ah'.

109
00:02:33,913 --> 00:02:35,650
What's great about mine is that from this angle

110
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,101
you got Mario with a hat, some eyes,

111
00:02:37,101 --> 00:02:40,120
but from this angle, he's a terrifying monster.

112
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,170
- So scary!

113
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,020
- It looks like one of those little Goombas, bro!

114
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,170
- Oh, you're so right!

115
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:45,410
- Bam, we got a little nose.

116
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,893
We gotta do his mustache.

117
00:02:48,248 --> 00:02:49,450
Aw man, it just looks like a mouth!

118
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:50,772
- [Collin] He's got a massive uni-brow.

119
00:02:50,772 --> 00:02:51,605
- Alright, here we go.

120
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:53,470
Gonna give Mario some pink sideburns.

121
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,303
Boom!

122
00:02:54,303 --> 00:02:55,244
Booooo.

123
00:02:55,244 --> 00:02:56,110
- Are the sounds necessary?

124
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,841
- The sounds are absolutely necessary.

125
00:02:57,841 --> 00:02:59,390
- Do, doop, doop,-doop, do, doop.

126
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,370
- Now time for the buttons!

127
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,390
'Cause as you guys know,

128
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,299
Oh, the top is still on.

129
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:04,920
What?

130
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,963
Button number one.

131
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:08,530
- That's a massive button, bro.

132
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,882
Wait, his overalls are like, straight down.

133
00:03:10,882 --> 00:03:11,774
(laughs)

134
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:12,740
(sneeze)

135
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,213
- We got big ol' beefy arms.

136
00:03:14,213 --> 00:03:15,046
Woo.

137
00:03:15,046 --> 00:03:15,879
Mario's been lifting!

138
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:16,712
- Meow

139
00:03:16,712 --> 00:03:17,870
We got to give him some, oh no!

140
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:18,720
I dropped my top.

141
00:03:20,463 --> 00:03:21,640
Yo, dude, what are you doing to that mouth?

142
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,800
He's like (growl).

143
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,478
And now, after every great art challenge,

144
00:03:25,478 --> 00:03:28,525
(electronic music)

145
00:03:28,525 --> 00:03:30,160
And now it's time for the big reveal.

146
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:30,993
Here we go!

147
00:03:30,993 --> 00:03:33,898
Three, two, one, Ta-da!

148
00:03:33,898 --> 00:03:35,430
I did my best.

149
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,263
That's all I can say.

150
00:03:36,263 --> 00:03:38,010
We'll be eating these at the end of the video

151
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,950
but right now, it's on to the next round.

152
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,517
This is one of the most requested ones

153
00:03:41,517 --> 00:03:43,370
and you wanted us to do Moana.

154
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:44,310
So right now, let's go!

155
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,130
I've got edible flowers, by the way?

156
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:47,759
- Alright.

157
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:49,520
(crunch)

158
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,380
These are edible?

159
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,386
Bro.

160
00:03:51,386 --> 00:03:52,219
(cough)

161
00:03:52,219 --> 00:03:53,460
- She's got this like a green wreath around her head.

162
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,750
Nailed it on so many levels.

163
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,570
We're gonna get some flowers in the top, bloop!

164
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,650
Boom! (clap) oh!

165
00:03:58,650 --> 00:03:59,483
Awesome!

166
00:03:59,483 --> 00:04:01,680
Alright, now we gotta add the whites around the eyes.

167
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,341
- Oh no, I misplaced one of the eyes.

168
00:04:03,341 --> 00:04:04,174
(gasp)

169
00:04:04,174 --> 00:04:06,020
- I know how I'm gonna use detail like no one else

170
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,743
has ever used detail before.

171
00:04:08,687 --> 00:04:09,520
(high-pitched screech)

172
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,353
Sucks in this round!

173
00:04:10,353 --> 00:04:12,640
- Oh no, my Moana looks super angry.

174
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,473
- Yo!

175
00:04:13,473 --> 00:04:14,306
- What have I done?

176
00:04:14,306 --> 00:04:15,390
She's like side-eyeing you right now.

177
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,223
She's like 'huh'.

178
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:17,503
- Well, because she sees that my Moana's got

179
00:04:17,503 --> 00:04:18,848
a way better eyelashes.

180
00:04:18,848 --> 00:04:20,252
(airhorn)

181
00:04:20,252 --> 00:04:22,080
(electronic music)

182
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,490
- Alright, the crown is done now, and (clap)

183
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:25,650
time to flower it up.

184
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,507
Alright, two little nostrils.

185
00:04:27,507 --> 00:04:29,200
And then give her a big ol' happy smile, though.

186
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,070
What are you doing with the cheeks?

187
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:30,903
- A little bit of blush!

188
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:32,240
She's got a little bit of rosy cheeks.

189
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,560
- She has sideburns, bro!

190
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,830
- She does, don't hate!

191
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,320
Everyone's special and different.

192
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,930
Yo, you know how people say they have pearly white teeth?

193
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:39,763
- Yeah?

194
00:04:39,763 --> 00:04:41,055
- I'm gonna give her literal pearls for teeth.

195
00:04:41,055 --> 00:04:42,040
- Alright, here we go.

196
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,990
I'm going around the perimeter of my cupcake.

197
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,750
I don't think this is really working out.

198
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,763
Bro, she's looking like a pirate now!

199
00:04:48,763 --> 00:04:49,596
(high-pitched 'what')

200
00:04:49,596 --> 00:04:50,510
Boom, locked it down.

201
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,770
Mine is completed.

202
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:54,290
- And, boom!

203
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,233
Locked it down.

204
00:04:55,233 --> 00:04:56,066
- Alright, here we go.

205
00:04:56,066 --> 00:04:56,899
The big reveal.

206
00:04:56,899 --> 00:04:58,770
Three, two, one, wait! - Sorry

218
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,857

219
00:05:16,857 --> 00:05:18,460
but you get to comment down below

220
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,550
and let us know who won.

221
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,580
- Mine's more like a wonk, wonk, wonk, right?

222
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,520
Than a tah-dah.

223
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,920
- You wanted us to do Jack Jack from the new Incredibles

224
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,753
movie. We're gonna speed run

225
00:05:25,753 --> 00:05:26,753
through this one because you know

226
00:05:26,753 --> 00:05:28,145
Jack Jack is like "pow, whew, whew"

227
00:05:28,145 --> 00:05:29,850
(squeaking)

228
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:32,848
Hand in, hand in, hands on, hands on

229
00:05:32,848 --> 00:05:34,741
(squeaking}

230
00:05:34,741 --> 00:05:36,900
Alright. - Okay, time for his hair.

231
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,025
Bro, you have ten seconds left.

232
00:05:38,025 --> 00:05:38,858
- Ten seconds!

233
00:05:38,858 --> 00:05:39,691
Ten! - No!

234
00:05:39,691 --> 00:05:40,524
Nine! - No!

235
00:05:40,524 --> 00:05:41,357
Eight! - No, no!

236
00:05:41,357 --> 00:05:45,143
Seven six, five, for, three, two, one! Done!

237
00:05:46,867 --> 00:05:47,720
- The big reveal!

238
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,690
Three, two, one, Tah-dah!

239
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:52,860
I was trying to make Jack Jack on fire

240
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,907
because you know he goes like (screams)

241
00:05:53,907 --> 00:05:55,520
and he bursts into flames.

242
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,120
Is that his hair? - I tried to do his hair.

243
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,523
That's so, that's actually pretty awesome.

244
00:05:58,523 --> 00:05:59,840
(beeping) So, you get to comment down below

245
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,450
who won this round, and right now

246
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:02,910
we are on to the next one.

247
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,870
On this one you challenged us to make Pikachu,

248
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:05,880
and right now begin.

249
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,690
Oh yeah. Oh that's nice.

250
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:08,830
This is called the cup'm roll.

251
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:09,990
Man it just took all my icing off.

252
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:12,330
If mine didn't look raggedy before,

253
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,190
boy, boy! (loud grunting)

254
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,023
squeeze

255
00:06:16,023 --> 00:06:17,780
See, Devon only does one toothpick at a time.

256
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,121
This is called the double toothpick wa-fananza.

257
00:06:20,121 --> 00:06:20,954
It's where you take two toothpicks

258
00:06:20,954 --> 00:06:22,020
and you go whew, double time.

259
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,870
Oh yeah, oh, oh look at that technique.

260
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,750
Now that we've got the base layer crusted

261
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:26,583
- Yes

262
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:27,416
Time to fill it in.

263
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:28,740
Okay, so we're gonna go eyeball number one

264
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,573
- [Collin] Here we go.

265
00:06:29,573 --> 00:06:31,940
- [Devon] He has really wide eyes, oh no!

266
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,740
His entire eye came off!

267
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,635
- Alright, cool. So, here we go.

268
00:06:34,635 --> 00:06:36,270
Now we've gotta get some eyebrows on my man.

269
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,160
Yo, his brows are thick!

270
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,837
Pikachu is an electric little dude,

271
00:06:39,837 --> 00:06:41,520
so I'm gonna add some lightening to him

272
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,338
(electric zapping)

273
00:06:43,338 --> 00:06:44,623
(laughing) I thought it was going to look so much better

274
00:06:44,623 --> 00:06:45,456
than it ended up looking

275
00:06:45,456 --> 00:06:47,500
- It looks like spider man attacked him.

276
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,160
(laughter) (squirt) webbed him - Yeah

277
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,039
Oh, oh, and done! Awe!

278
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,450
Alright, now I've gotta add the,

279
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:54,330
- Awe! Dude you've ruined it.

280
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,760
You're gonna make it worse! - Awe!

281
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,600
- Alright, here it is the big reveal. Are you Ready?

282
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,149
Three, two, one, Tah-dah!

283
00:07:01,149 --> 00:07:04,020
You get to comment down below who won this round.

284
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,020
This is a toss up, so guys right now

285
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:06,853
we're on to the next one.

286
00:07:06,853 --> 00:07:09,330
For this one you challenged us to make a character

287
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:10,473
from the new avengers movie and you're gonna

288
00:07:10,473 --> 00:07:12,540
have to figure out which one we chose.

289
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,373
So, right now begin.

290
00:07:13,373 --> 00:07:15,430
Alright, so I'm gonna go for the color green,

291
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,420
which will give you no hint

292
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,700
at to which one I'm making.

293
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,650
- I think it does Collins. - Nope

294
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:22,189
He's got bad skin, he's aged very quickly.

295
00:07:22,189 --> 00:07:23,980
Anger, ages you quickly?

296
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:26,600
So, I've got to give him some angry brows.

297
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,490
Anger - Anger (roaring)

298
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,470
- This dude looks super, duper, duper angry.

299
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:34,740
- I'm sorry, but the grinch is not in the avengers.

300
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,710
- The grinch? No this dude would not steal christmas.

301
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,850
He would smash christmas.

302
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,730
- Oh yeah, I have no idea who this is.

303
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:42,880
- No clue.

304
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,305
What else can I do to distinguish

305
00:07:44,305 --> 00:07:45,880
(gasp) (ping) I'm gonna need some more cupcakes.

306
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,733
Hold up. Bam! Alright, there we go.

307
00:07:50,543 --> 00:07:52,440
I got another green! Yeah boy! Woo!

308
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,820
- I've never seen someone so excited about green before.

309
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,240
- This is coming along saucily

310
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,870
The most important part about my character

311
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,730
is the muscle definition. Here we go, Bam!

312
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:04,370
Look at that line. Now I've gotta give my little dude

313
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:06,831
some fingers. Oh, there's a finger, another finger.

314
00:08:06,831 --> 00:08:08,954
Boom!, I'm locking it in. - Oh my gosh.

315
00:08:08,954 --> 00:08:12,000
(electronic music)

316
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,830
- Dude, I'm blown away, that is the most

317
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:16,020
incredible cupcake you have ever made.

318
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,080
Which is saying a lot.

319
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,220
Here it is, the big reveal.

320
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,882

We wanna see if you can like this video in three seconds.

324
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,610
Are you ready? Here we go.

325
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:29,470
Three, two, one, done! Let's take a look.

326
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:32,624
Three, two, one, Tah-dah! (laughs)

327
00:08:32,624 --> 00:08:34,704
It's the Hulk flexing like this

328
00:08:34,704 --> 00:08:35,537
- What?

329
00:08:35,537 --> 00:08:36,440

00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,980
we are on to the next.

332
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:42,610
You wanted us to make Chewbacca from the new solo movie.

333
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:45,210
We're doing this as a speed round. So, right now go!

334
00:08:46,509 --> 00:08:47,950
- This is going to be incredible dude.

335
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:48,783
- Oh no!

336
00:08:48,783 --> 00:08:51,860
- I'm gonna use only sprinkles for this cupcake dude.

337
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,300
- How is that sticking to the cupcake?

338
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,386
You're getting sprinkles everywhere! Look at that.

339
00:08:55,386 --> 00:08:57,719
(Squeaking)

340
00:09:00,046 --> 00:09:00,879
(hornlike sound)

341
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:02,550
- Did I do it? Oh, oh, oh look at this

342
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,710
it's actually kind of working.

343
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,878
- But if you shake it a tiny bit, (blowing)

344
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,041
(sobbing)

345
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:09,330
(squeaking)

346
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:10,163
Locking it in!

347
00:09:10,163 --> 00:09:10,996
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa bro!

348
00:09:10,996 --> 00:09:12,840
I haven't even done anything yet.

349
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,825
- What have you been doing? (laughter)

350
00:09:13,825 --> 00:09:15,520
- I just did his fur.

351
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,076
- It looks like mold. - What are you doing?

352
00:09:17,076 --> 00:09:18,570
- All of the time is up so you better go quick.

353
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:22,547
- Okay, wait. Sike! Swap! 15 second bonus.

354
00:09:22,547 --> 00:09:24,500
- 15 seconds, no way! - You have to fix it up!

355
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,330
- Oh my gosh! Eye ball, eye ball, mouth,

356
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:29,162
and pink, pink, pink, pink, pink, pink

357
00:09:29,162 --> 00:09:30,500
- Why didn't you finish this sooner dude?

358
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,990
- Dude, why did you switch them like that?

359
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,817
Okay, and done. Well there's that.

360
00:09:35,817 --> 00:09:38,041
Dude, I have no clue how you switched them,

361
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:40,156
but you get to comment down below who won this round.

362
00:09:40,156 --> 00:09:41,820
I'm just extremely confused right now,

363
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,010
and I guess we're on to the next one

364
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,344
For the final round we're doing a freestyle

365
00:09:46,344 --> 00:09:47,177
- Yep.

366
00:09:47,177 --> 00:09:48,159
- And you're gonna have to figure

367
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:49,240
out what it is we're making in real time. (laughter)

368
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,450
So right now, let's go.

369
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:51,490
Alright, so we've got these, boom!

370
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:54,872
Mine is going to be fan-fl-la-la-ipping-tastic.

371
00:09:54,872 --> 00:09:58,300
(horn sound) Oh yeah. Boom-ba-do-bop-da-bing-bop-boo.

372
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,150
- Oh no.

373
00:09:59,150 --> 00:09:59,983
- Are you messing up?

374
00:09:59,983 --> 00:10:01,170
What are you making?

375
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:02,003
- Ah, there we go.

376
00:10:02,003 --> 00:10:03,347
- That looks like a giant 'S'.

377
00:10:05,066 --> 00:10:06,023
- For what, Shrek?

378
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:10,270
Next up is the red. - Oh yeah boy.

379
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,930
If you can figure out what mine is right now

380
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:13,840
I will be blown away because you don't have

381
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,480
much to go on at all at the moment.

382
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,247
- I am making the border around my 'S'

383
00:10:18,247 --> 00:10:19,550
(grunting)

384
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,770
- Why does it look like lip gloss

385
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,180
and not actually, it doesn't look anything

386
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,210
like frosting at all.

387
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:24,320
- I just have to fill in the rest.

388
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,920
- Done! (sigh) Alright, there we go.

389
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,830
So, Devan reveal what is yours.

390
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,750
- What did you make, like several brains?

391
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,120
- What? No! Dude mine is like the visor

392
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,340
from ready player one, when he's going through the oasis.

393
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,230
- I made the superman 'S'. - Great!

394
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,870
We're gonna be eating these coming up right now

395
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,480
and you get to comment down below who won this round.

396
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,930
And right now its time to feast on some cup cakes.

397
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:44,360
Now for the moment you all have been waiting for.

398
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,410
Time to try all these delicious looking cupcakes.

399
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:49,860
We're going to end with the most beautiful Mario

400
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,450
of all time. Before we eat them

401
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,530
comment down below what are some other characters

402
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:55,800
you would love to see us make a cupcake version of.

403
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,790
We're beginning with Moana

404
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:57,880
because there's a lot of different textures.

405
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,920
We've got little pearls on mine, some eyelashes,

406
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,050
some flowers for the hair.

407
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:02,500
- Some terrible flowers though.

408
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,600
Those were whew! - Yeah

409
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,218
These are going to taste really interesting.

410
00:11:05,218 --> 00:11:06,551
Three, two, one.

411
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,740
- I'm getting half of a flower,

412
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,815
but I'm getting some great cupcake. (clapping)

413
00:11:12,815 --> 00:11:13,648
- Oh yeah.

414
00:11:15,577 --> 00:11:17,307
Oh man this is so good.

415
00:11:17,307 --> 00:11:19,320
- I don't know how I feel - It's so good.

416
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,698
Next up we're going for Pikichu.

417
00:11:20,698 --> 00:11:21,531
- Oh yeah!

418
00:11:21,531 --> 00:11:23,380
- Mine got electrocuted, so my Pikichu looks

419
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,050
absolutely crazy.

420
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:26,670
- Dude I never really took a good look

421
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,410
at mine, mine looks terrifying.

422
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:31,533
- He looks mildly disappointed at everything in life.

423
00:11:31,533 --> 00:11:32,366
He's like (whining).

424
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,003
Three, two, one!

425
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:38,114
(moaning)

426
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,950
- Awe man, uh, uh, uh, I got his eye.

427
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,390
- So, mine taste like a slice of goodness man.

428
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,250
It's just that the cupcake is so soft and nice,

429
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,466
and like fluffy, and then like good sugar.

430
00:11:47,466 --> 00:11:49,107
- This one's a really fluffy cupcake.

431
00:11:49,107 --> 00:11:49,940
- That one's delicious.

432
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,850
Before we eat the Hulk, let's try Jack Jack

433
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,660
because he's kind of like a superhero of sorts.

434
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,862
- This is not Jack Jack bro. - That is so Jack Jack.

435
00:11:55,862 --> 00:11:57,149
- I don't what this is

436
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:58,520
- I'm gonna get a big bite of the blue.

437
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,450
Ready? Three - Mine is just all black.

438
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:01,457
- two, one!

439
00:12:01,457 --> 00:12:04,675
(electronic music) (moaning)

440
00:12:04,675 --> 00:12:06,925
(mumbling)

441
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:13,285
- Alright on to the next one.

442
00:12:13,285 --> 00:12:15,960
- Alright, now it's time to eat my hulk and your iron man.

443
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,120
- Dude, I kind of don't want to eat this.

444
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,850
- It looks absolutely incredible.

445
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:20,730
But, I definitely won.

446
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:21,680
Let's go for this, you ready?

447
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,800
I'm gonna take a big bite of his big mouth.

448
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,620
- Oh no! Half of his face came off.

449
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,140
- That's so, how could you do that?

450
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,180
This is a scary look, it's just about

451
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,800
to like bite into this man.

452
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,555
- His mouth looks like a brain again.

453
00:12:31,555 --> 00:12:33,683
Three, two, one!

454
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:36,800
(moaning)

455
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,102
His eyebrow ahh

456
00:12:39,102 --> 00:12:41,114
Dude you've got it all over your face.

457
00:12:41,114 --> 00:12:42,820
(muffled voice)

458
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,790
You what? Yeah, that's a good idea

459
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:45,623
to use one of the arms.

460
00:12:45,623 --> 00:12:47,528
- Before Mario, time to eat Chewbacca.

461
00:12:47,528 --> 00:12:49,860
Why did you put so many sprinkles on here?

462
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,693
- That was the whole idea man.

463
00:12:50,693 --> 00:12:51,526
- Alright you ready?

464
00:12:51,526 --> 00:12:53,363
Three, two, one!

465
00:12:55,263 --> 00:12:56,633
- Oh!

466
00:12:56,633 --> 00:12:59,506
(moaning)

467
00:12:59,506 --> 00:13:01,658
Oh my goodness, it's so good.

468
00:13:01,658 --> 00:13:04,271
It has like whole another crunchy flavor to it.

469
00:13:04,271 --> 00:13:06,432
(moaning)

470
00:13:06,432 --> 00:13:08,704
- Great job man. - You did a great job too

471
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:09,980
(muffled voices)

472
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:10,813
Really fluffy.

473
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,980
- Now the final one, Mario - Awe Dude!

474
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,370
- So Devan, I'm just gonna eat yours.

475
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:16,972
I'm gonna take the bottom half, you take the top.

476
00:13:16,972 --> 00:13:19,040
- Click right over here right after this

477
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,637
to see another video, but let's take a bite out of this.

478
00:13:20,637 --> 00:13:22,191
You ready Devan? - Yep, I'm ready.

479
00:13:22,191 --> 00:13:23,024
Alright, here we go.

480
00:13:23,024 --> 00:13:24,573
Three, two, one!

481
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:31,124
Oh bro! You take a bite out of the other side

482
00:13:31,124 --> 00:13:32,050
and I take one out of this side.

483
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:36,886
(moaning) (muffled voices)

484
00:13:36,886 --> 00:13:39,719
Five, four, three, two, one, done.

485
00:13:41,944 --> 00:13:43,320
Next time. Bye! (Beep)

486
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,220
Dude, you're in my space, Devan.

487
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,053
- I'm sorry

488
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,930
- Mario's been hitting up the barber shop.

489
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:49,763
- Barber shop.
