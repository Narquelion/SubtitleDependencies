Okay, I'm going to use a Sharpie,

36
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:01,238
I'm going to draw a little "x" on myself right now.

00:01:15,334 --> 00:01:16,799
I don't know if this is going to work or not, but watch.

46
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,525
You have the "x" right here and if I just...

(suspenseful music)

48
00:01:22,631 --> 00:01:23,464

55
00:01:37,308 --> 00:01:38,975
One, two, like that.

- No, I'm not doing it.

71
00:02:06,864 --> 00:02:10,086
If there's an "x" on my hand I'm walking away.

77
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,478

00:02:36,132 --> 00:02:38,712
I want you to turn over your hand.

86
00:02:38,712 --> 00:02:41,352
(screaming)

87
00:02:41,352 --> 00:02:43,259
- What on earth?

88
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:45,485
How did you do that?

89
00:02:45,485 --> 00:02:48,053
How did you freaking do that, like I'm serious.

What?

94
00:02:53,405 --> 00:02:54,430

95
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,896

96
00:02:55,896 --> 00:02:57,954
that's the things, it's like what happened?
