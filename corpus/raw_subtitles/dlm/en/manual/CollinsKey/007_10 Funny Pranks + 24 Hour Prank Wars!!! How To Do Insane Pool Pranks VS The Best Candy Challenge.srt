1
00:00:00,038 --> 00:00:01,790
- It's 4:00 AM in the morning. Devan's still asleep.

2
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:02,927
And for the next 24 hours,

3
00:00:02,927 --> 00:00:05,389
I'm going to be pranking my friends nonstop.

4
00:00:05,389 --> 00:00:06,222
Oh snap!

5
00:00:07,061 --> 00:00:08,254
- What? Bro! Bro! Bro!

6
00:00:08,254 --> 00:00:09,147
- Good morning Devan

7
00:00:09,147 --> 00:00:10,001
(techno music)

8
00:00:10,001 --> 00:00:12,145
Devan wake up it's time to go man, let's go.

9
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:14,719
- Wait why are you doing this, oh my god.

10
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:15,759
- [Collins Key] It's 6:00 AM in the morning,

11
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:16,977
we are outside of Bella's house

12
00:00:16,977 --> 00:00:18,340
and it's time to prank her.

13
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:19,792
Devan's dressed up like a giant Teddy bear he's going to

14
00:00:19,792 --> 00:00:21,659
scare her, and I'm going to do a slime dump but right now

15
00:00:21,659 --> 00:00:22,864
let's get into position before she leaves quick.

16
00:00:22,864 --> 00:00:24,005
So here we go. Let's go over here.

17
00:00:24,005 --> 00:00:24,838
I've got the slime bucket.

18
00:00:24,838 --> 00:00:25,905
I'm going to be hopping upstairs like this.

19
00:00:25,905 --> 00:00:27,981
And remember for the next 24 hours,

20
00:00:27,981 --> 00:00:30,842
I'm pranking my friends nonstop, and first up, is Bella.

21
00:00:30,842 --> 00:00:31,675
- I'm coming towards ya.

22
00:00:31,675 --> 00:00:33,267
- Devan that's not me

23
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:34,673
- And I'm going to give you a big bear hug.

24
00:00:34,673 --> 00:00:36,286
- That's not me I want a hug.

25
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:38,463
Dude over here. I'm over here. Yes

26
00:00:38,463 --> 00:00:39,925
- Where are you? I was hugging a palm tree?

27
00:00:39,925 --> 00:00:40,758
- I couldn't stop you.

28
00:00:40,758 --> 00:00:41,730
Okay dude. Come on over here, dude seriously.

29
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:42,563
Watch your step.

30
00:00:42,563 --> 00:00:43,396
- Watch my step. What do you mean?

31
00:00:43,396 --> 00:00:45,265
- Dude Devan, there are literally steps right behind you

32
00:00:45,265 --> 00:00:46,315
- Oh, okay, okay

33
00:00:46,315 --> 00:00:48,109
- I feel like I'm dealing with a massive child right now.

34
00:00:48,109 --> 00:00:49,734
Like a huge Toddler. You want to take a seat?

35
00:00:49,734 --> 00:00:50,567
- Okay where?

36
00:00:50,567 --> 00:00:53,469
- No, no, no, Devan oh my gosh, you're so heavy.

37
00:00:53,469 --> 00:00:54,328
Holy cow. Dude are you good?

38
00:00:54,328 --> 00:00:55,161
- Yeah I'm good.

39
00:00:55,161 --> 00:00:56,506
- I pulled a muscle in my neck. You got it?

40
00:00:56,506 --> 00:00:58,490
- I might rip it. I might rip it. Oh no.

41
00:00:58,490 --> 00:00:59,698
- Okay

42
00:00:59,698 --> 00:01:00,817
And there

43
00:01:00,817 --> 00:01:01,688
That looks pretty good to me

44
00:01:01,688 --> 00:01:02,521
Okay. Well one second.

45
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:03,356
Alright here we go to the finishing touch right here.

46
00:01:03,356 --> 00:01:04,503
We got the package. So here we go Devan

47
00:01:04,503 --> 00:01:05,745
you just want to hold this package here.

48
00:01:05,745 --> 00:01:07,393
It's right there. Yeah. Perfect. Just chill there.

49
00:01:07,393 --> 00:01:08,300
Yo, so I think I hear Bella coming.

50
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,351
I gotta get upstairs really quick, here we go.

51
00:01:09,351 --> 00:01:10,355
- All right, go quick, go quick go.

52
00:01:10,355 --> 00:01:11,397
- I'm over here, good, I'm over here.

53
00:01:11,397 --> 00:01:12,636
(bouncy piano music)

54
00:01:12,636 --> 00:01:16,135
(tense orchestral music)

55
00:01:16,135 --> 00:01:19,718
- What is this, is there like a name on it?

56
00:01:22,219 --> 00:01:23,759
All right well what's up with this?

57
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:24,608
(Devan screams)

58
00:01:24,608 --> 00:01:25,852
(Bella screams)

59
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:27,500
- Hey, it's me Devan.

60
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,083
Bear hug! What's up?

61
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:29,916
- Oh my god!

62
00:01:29,916 --> 00:01:31,666
- I've got slime dump coming up man let's go.

63
00:01:31,666 --> 00:01:33,471
- We're just delivering our brand new toys,

64
00:01:33,471 --> 00:01:36,058
games and challenges available at Walmart to our friends.

65
00:01:36,058 --> 00:01:37,960
I'm so sorry for scaring you.

66
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,725
- [Bella] No it's okay, I'm just glad

67
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:41,058
- I know right.

68
00:01:41,058 --> 00:01:41,891
(Bella screams)

69
00:01:41,891 --> 00:01:43,808
- Whoa, whoa dude. Yes!

70
00:01:45,513 --> 00:01:46,700
- All right well have fun going for your run

71
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:47,533
see you later, Bella.

72
00:01:47,533 --> 00:01:48,935
- Wait guys um.

73
00:01:48,935 --> 00:01:50,474
- I can't. I'm sorry. I gotta go

74
00:01:50,474 --> 00:01:52,013
- I'll just play it by myself then.

75
00:01:52,013 --> 00:01:52,846
- [Collins] For this next prank.

76
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:54,838
I've invited some friends over it's about 10:30 in the

77
00:01:54,838 --> 00:01:58,066
morning right now. So let's get them.

78
00:01:58,066 --> 00:01:59,087
All right so here's the thing none of them knows

79
00:01:59,087 --> 00:02:00,733
there's actually a massive prank going on

80
00:02:00,733 --> 00:02:01,566
right now.

81
00:02:01,566 --> 00:02:03,187
We're wrapping all of their cars in saran wrap,

82
00:02:03,187 --> 00:02:05,413
wrapping paper, filling with ballpit balls at the warehouse

83
00:02:05,413 --> 00:02:06,995
literally as we speak with the whole team.

84
00:02:06,995 --> 00:02:09,257
So, shh don't say anything.

85
00:02:09,257 --> 00:02:11,057
(Collins' friends talking)

86
00:02:11,057 --> 00:02:12,164
- Alright. Everyone's back there.

87
00:02:12,164 --> 00:02:14,033
And now it's time to pull the craziest pranks yet.

88
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:15,681
Cause they just think they're here to play with our new line

89
00:02:15,681 --> 00:02:16,819
of toys, games, and challenges,

90
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:19,328
but really it's only a set up so we can pull back to back

91
00:02:19,328 --> 00:02:20,490
nonstop, pranks on them.

92
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:21,680
So right now, let's go get them.

93
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,935
Yo, alright guys. Let's do it.

94
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,186
- [Devan] Welcome back!

95
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:26,019
- We brought you guys over here.

96
00:02:26,019 --> 00:02:26,852
Basically we're going to do like a

97
00:02:26,852 --> 00:02:28,163

98
00:02:28,163 --> 00:02:29,177
that's just launched, actually like today.

99
00:02:29,177 --> 00:02:30,964
So we're super excited about it.

100
00:02:30,964 --> 00:02:32,078
So here's what we'll do, we'll do like a little

101
00:02:32,078 --> 00:02:33,634
intro and then we'll get to the gameplay. Sounds good.

102
00:02:33,634 --> 00:02:34,717
- [Friends] Yeah.

103
00:02:34,717 --> 00:02:35,550
- Yo, what's up.

104
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,383

106
00:02:37,216 --> 00:02:38,049

Now Nina. You want to open up.

00:02:43,052 --> 00:02:44,888
This here is the mystery wheel challenge.

111
00:02:44,888 --> 00:02:46,760
Yeah you want to open it up, and take it out. Let's see

112
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,593
(Box exploding)

113
00:02:47,593 --> 00:02:50,192
(everyone screams)

114
00:02:50,192 --> 00:02:51,025
- Whoa, oh snap.

115
00:02:51,025 --> 00:02:52,393
Holy cow, are you all right?

116
00:02:52,393 --> 00:02:53,226
- It got on me!

117
00:02:53,226 --> 00:02:54,059
- It got on you!

118
00:02:54,059 --> 00:02:55,142
- Oh no!

119
00:02:55,142 --> 00:02:56,196
- Are you good?

120
00:02:56,196 --> 00:02:57,029
- Holy cow!

121
00:02:57,029 --> 00:02:58,043
- It got everywhere.

122
00:02:58,043 --> 00:02:59,363
- Let's get you cleaned off real quick.

123
00:02:59,363 --> 00:03:01,134
Then we'll play the product. Right? cool

124
00:03:01,134 --> 00:03:02,726
- Alright guys I'm in the cupboard for my final,

125
00:03:02,726 --> 00:03:03,731
greatest jump scare.

126
00:03:03,731 --> 00:03:05,942
waiting for somebody to finally come by so I can finally

127
00:03:05,942 --> 00:03:08,017
scare someone. If I was inside the cupboard,

128
00:03:08,017 --> 00:03:09,393
I would be doing math problems

129
00:03:09,393 --> 00:03:11,616
like crazy. Four times four, 16.

130
00:03:11,616 --> 00:03:12,635
(cool music)

131
00:03:12,635 --> 00:03:13,949
- All right are you all cleaned off.

132
00:03:13,949 --> 00:03:14,844
- Yeah

133
00:03:14,844 --> 00:03:15,727
- I'm so sorry. Okay.

134
00:03:15,727 --> 00:03:17,709
- Let's reveal the mystery wheel. You're ready.

135
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:18,542
- Yes, okay here we go.

136
00:03:18,542 --> 00:03:20,945
Three, two, one. Taadaa!

137
00:03:20,945 --> 00:03:23,389
- Yes. It comes with some playing cards here.

138
00:03:23,389 --> 00:03:25,392
I'll put those right there.

139
00:03:25,392 --> 00:03:26,688
- Oh dude, look at that.

140
00:03:26,688 --> 00:03:28,751
(girls scream)

141
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:29,966
- I got an idea

142
00:03:29,966 --> 00:03:32,032
You get a bucket, and you fill the bucket with water.

143
00:03:32,032 --> 00:03:33,418
Can you grab that broom, that's over there.

144
00:03:33,418 --> 00:03:35,272
It's a little life hack. If you want to catch a cockroach,

145
00:03:35,272 --> 00:03:36,201
put the bucket up here.

146
00:03:36,201 --> 00:03:37,034
- Yep, exactly.

147
00:03:37,034 --> 00:03:37,867
- Push it up, push it up.

148
00:03:37,867 --> 00:03:38,704
And then Bella do you want to come over here?

149
00:03:38,704 --> 00:03:40,057
You want to just hold this, real quick?

150
00:03:40,057 --> 00:03:40,890
You just grab that.

151
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:41,727
You just want to hold that.

152
00:03:41,727 --> 00:03:43,569
Perfect. All right guys we're all set

153
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:44,448
- Wait wait wait wait

154
00:03:44,448 --> 00:03:45,823
- What? You're just going to hold it.

155
00:03:45,823 --> 00:03:46,656
- It's part of a life hack.

156
00:03:46,656 --> 00:03:47,782
All right girls so what else we got in here?

157
00:03:47,782 --> 00:03:50,155
- So this is a container that all the mystery compounds and

158
00:03:50,155 --> 00:03:52,355
add ins comes in, we'll reveal those in a second.

159
00:03:52,355 --> 00:03:54,634
But first, let's load up the mystery wheel.

160
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:55,467
- It's basically going to decide

161
00:03:55,467 --> 00:03:56,763
which fake food it is we're making

162
00:03:56,763 --> 00:03:58,284
with all these crazy compounds in here.

163
00:03:58,284 --> 00:04:01,117
- Here we go three, two, one spin!

164
00:04:02,912 --> 00:04:04,096
Here we go a donut

165
00:04:04,096 --> 00:04:04,929
- Yes!

166
00:04:04,929 --> 00:04:05,762
- Hey! Yes.

167
00:04:05,762 --> 00:04:06,790
All right so it landed on blue,

168
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:08,987
that means I get the blue compartment to open,

169
00:04:08,987 --> 00:04:11,279
and get my mystery compounds

170
00:04:11,279 --> 00:04:13,864
- You guys get to spin next to find out what compounds you

171
00:04:13,864 --> 00:04:14,965
guys get? All right, here we go.

172
00:04:14,965 --> 00:04:17,709
Three, two, one, spin it! Nice

173
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:18,874
- All right so you guys are a team.

174
00:04:18,874 --> 00:04:19,707
You guys get the yellow.

175
00:04:19,707 --> 00:04:21,260
Collin, why don't you and Tibbles be a team.

176
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,287
- Yeah!

177
00:04:22,287 --> 00:04:23,921
- Bella and I could be a team over here. Okay.

178
00:04:23,921 --> 00:04:27,049
- I don't know if I can this is getting heavy

179
00:04:27,049 --> 00:04:29,798
(shouting and screaming)

180
00:04:29,798 --> 00:04:30,631
- I tried to save it

181
00:04:30,631 --> 00:04:31,932
- You got it on me more.

182
00:04:31,932 --> 00:04:33,985
- The big reveal, the bug is still there

183
00:04:33,985 --> 00:04:34,876
- [Devan] It didn't even work?

184
00:04:34,876 --> 00:04:35,797
- Okay great.

185
00:04:35,797 --> 00:04:38,235
- So my biceps are sore for nothing?

186
00:04:38,235 --> 00:04:39,893
- Sore? I'm soaked fam.

187
00:04:39,893 --> 00:04:41,312
All right Ben so now it's time for us to spin

188
00:04:41,312 --> 00:04:43,478
- Yo I just noticed Lauren doesn't have a teammate.

189
00:04:43,478 --> 00:04:44,641
- Oh yeah, you're right.

190
00:04:44,641 --> 00:04:46,799
- We got like this mannequin, like dummy looking dude.

191
00:04:46,799 --> 00:04:48,639
- He's in the media room. If you just go upstairs,

192
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,156
you can use him as your teammate.

193
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:51,513
- All right, Ben. Here we go. We're going to spin it.

194
00:04:51,513 --> 00:04:52,346
What color do you think we should get?

195
00:04:52,346 --> 00:04:53,202
- Green's my favorite.

196
00:04:53,202 --> 00:04:55,020
- Green's your favorite color? Here we go three, two, one.

197
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,661
We learned things about Ben today.

198
00:04:56,661 --> 00:04:57,774
(Victory music)

199
00:04:57,774 --> 00:04:58,944
(everyone screaming)

200
00:04:58,944 --> 00:04:59,777
- We got green.

201
00:04:59,777 --> 00:05:00,883
- Dude, okay

202
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:03,883
(Suspenseful music)

203
00:05:07,559 --> 00:05:08,436
(Mannequin screams)

204
00:05:08,436 --> 00:05:11,234
(Lauren screams)

205
00:05:11,234 --> 00:05:12,590
- It was alive

206
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:13,805
- What happened? What?

207
00:05:13,805 --> 00:05:15,965
- Oh my goodness. Are you okay

208
00:05:15,965 --> 00:05:17,584
- I feel kind of bad for Lauren, how about you

209
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:18,417
join our team all right?

210
00:05:18,417 --> 00:05:20,731
- Oh, good idea. Join the losing team.

211
00:05:20,731 --> 00:05:21,839
- It's Day three in the cupboard.

212
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:23,670
I just want somebody to hold me sometimes.

213
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:24,503
- All right, guys.

214
00:05:24,503 --> 00:05:27,986
The competition begins in three, two, one, go.

215
00:05:27,986 --> 00:05:29,393
- [Bella] Here we go!

216
00:05:29,393 --> 00:05:30,924
- Bella is a pro look at this

217
00:05:30,924 --> 00:05:32,814
- [Girl] Okay, we're going for the twist.

218
00:05:32,814 --> 00:05:33,903
Now we put it together.

219
00:05:33,903 --> 00:05:35,469
- [Devan] I'll just roll it out a little bit here.

220
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:37,571
- [Everyone] And done!

221
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:38,703
- [Collins] How did you get that so perfect.

222
00:05:38,703 --> 00:05:39,536
- What do you mean?

223
00:05:39,536 --> 00:05:40,369
- You cheated bro

224
00:05:40,369 --> 00:05:41,374
- What are you going to do about it bro?

225
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:42,399
What are you gonna do about it?

226
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:43,278
- This Devan!

227
00:05:43,278 --> 00:05:44,113
- What? No! Oh no!

228
00:05:44,113 --> 00:05:47,280
(everyone screaming)

229
00:05:49,861 --> 00:05:51,942
- Guys, it's a prank video

230
00:05:51,942 --> 00:05:55,341
this here is actually sugar glass. So it's not real glass.

231
00:05:55,341 --> 00:05:56,930
So do not try that at home

232
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,544
why don't we spin right now to find out who

233
00:05:58,544 --> 00:06:00,878
wins and whoever wins gets a big surprise.

234
00:06:00,878 --> 00:06:01,711
- Here we go.

235
00:06:01,711 --> 00:06:03,399
Three, two, one. Let's see.

236
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:04,994
- Let's see what it's gonna be.

237
00:06:04,994 --> 00:06:05,905
- Previous winners!

238
00:06:05,905 --> 00:06:06,738
- No!

239
00:06:06,738 --> 00:06:07,821
- Yes!

240
00:06:07,821 --> 00:06:09,540
(screaming noises)

241
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,698
- Okay guys I think I hear them.

242
00:06:10,698 --> 00:06:11,640
I'm going to turn off this light,

243
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,951
so that way I can get ready to scare them.

244
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:14,555
Put on my angry face.

245
00:06:14,555 --> 00:06:16,027
- I don't know that that's the prettiest.

246
00:06:16,027 --> 00:06:17,904
Have you seen this down here?

247
00:06:17,904 --> 00:06:18,737
- Oh!

248
00:06:19,766 --> 00:06:20,724
- Plot twist

249
00:06:20,724 --> 00:06:23,220
But here's the thing guys, it's about creativity.

250
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,741
And they got creative with their donuts.

251
00:06:24,741 --> 00:06:27,509
Your guys just kinda got, kinda like eh.

252
00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:28,342

253
00:06:28,342 --> 00:06:29,175

266
00:06:52,346 --> 00:06:53,645
Click the top link in the description,

(Nina and Lauren screaming)

271
00:07:04,897 --> 00:07:08,385
- [Collin] Are you guys all right?

00:07:08,385 --> 00:07:09,968
Left you one more awesome prize for you guys,

273
00:07:09,968 --> 00:07:10,896

00:07:11,867 --> 00:07:12,700
We'll head over there

276
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,728
All right guys let's do this.

277
00:07:14,728 --> 00:07:16,279
- Let's get you out of the cupboard, here you go.

278
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:17,502
I'll take this.

279
00:07:17,502 --> 00:07:18,667
- [Devan] Collins is out pranking our friends,

280
00:07:18,667 --> 00:07:19,619
but little does he know

281
00:07:19,619 --> 00:07:21,560
I have the biggest prank to pull on him

282
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,804
That's right I ordered over 1,000,000 packing peanuts

283
00:07:24,804 --> 00:07:26,519
and now it's time to put them in his room.

284
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:28,929
All right now that we got all the bags inside,

285
00:07:28,929 --> 00:07:30,287
and I actually brought one of my friends

286
00:07:30,287 --> 00:07:32,312
Ben here, where'd he go

287
00:07:32,312 --> 00:07:34,530
There's Ben. He's gonna help me get it into Collins room

288
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:36,125
Let's do this thing. Here we go. Yeet!

289
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:38,463
All right we got it. Success.

290
00:07:38,463 --> 00:07:39,840
All right it's time to get a little crazy.

291
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,423
You ready for this? Here we go!

292
00:07:43,642 --> 00:07:45,443
Dude I did not think that through.

293
00:07:45,443 --> 00:07:46,276
- [Collins] Initial thoughts,

294
00:07:46,276 --> 00:07:47,573
what do you guys think the surprise is?

295
00:07:47,573 --> 00:07:48,657
- Um, bugs

296
00:07:48,657 --> 00:07:49,490
- Bugs

297
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:50,323
(Collins laughs)

298
00:07:50,323 --> 00:07:51,737
- [Collins] Okay , so let's do this,

299
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:52,880
so if you guys want to line up

300
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,306
and right about there turn and

301
00:07:54,306 --> 00:07:55,551
then turn your face this way right now.

302
00:07:55,551 --> 00:07:57,482
- All right so now that we have all the bags up here

303
00:07:57,482 --> 00:08:00,325
it is time to remove the stuff out of Collins' room.

304
00:08:00,325 --> 00:08:01,376
Cause I think it might get broken.

305
00:08:01,376 --> 00:08:02,487
All right all right let's move this over.

306
00:08:02,487 --> 00:08:03,423
Here we go, three, two.

307
00:08:03,423 --> 00:08:05,761
(grunting)

308
00:08:05,761 --> 00:08:08,288
- We should probably leave that maybe move the lamp

309
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:09,467
- I think we're both one-trip kind of guys

310
00:08:09,467 --> 00:08:11,695
whoo, I'm going to break this stuff on my way out

311
00:08:11,695 --> 00:08:14,648
Where'd James go. James we're ready for yah.

312
00:08:14,648 --> 00:08:16,461
You're going so slow Collins is about to be here

316
00:08:20,807 --> 00:08:22,807
- [Girls] Oh my goodness

317
00:08:23,663 --> 00:08:24,935
- How did they do this?

318
00:08:24,935 --> 00:08:26,071
- How am I going to get in?

319
00:08:26,071 --> 00:08:27,377
- This is insane

320
00:08:27,377 --> 00:08:28,710
- Help me get mine off

321
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:29,963
- Teamwork makes the dream work

322
00:08:29,963 --> 00:08:30,796
- Let's sumo it out

323
00:08:30,796 --> 00:08:32,106
- Oh yes.

324
00:08:32,106 --> 00:08:33,356
Three, two, one

325
00:08:35,168 --> 00:08:36,919
Whoa, whoa, whoa, guys, guys, guys.

326
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:37,752
- What, what, what!

327
00:08:37,752 --> 00:08:38,817
- Guys, I got to go.

328
00:08:38,817 --> 00:08:39,650
- What happened with the prank

329
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:40,612
wait dude where are you going?

330
00:08:40,612 --> 00:08:42,122
You're actually just leaving?

331
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:43,295
- I'll be back

332
00:08:43,295 --> 00:08:44,415
- Pass me a bag, pass me a bag.

333
00:08:44,415 --> 00:08:45,966
We got to finish this thing up real quick.

334
00:08:45,966 --> 00:08:46,950
- What about my car?

335
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:47,783
- Oh yeah

336
00:08:47,783 --> 00:08:48,973
- I can't get in

337
00:08:48,973 --> 00:08:51,226
- [Collins] Let's do this, maybe everyone gets a door

338
00:08:51,226 --> 00:08:53,309
and we all just open it up on the count of three.

339
00:08:53,309 --> 00:08:55,980
Here we go three, two, one, go for it.

340
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,959
(screaming)

341
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,634
- Looks like a wonderland

342
00:09:00,634 --> 00:09:02,072
- Okay now that we've filled up the rest of the room

343
00:09:02,072 --> 00:09:04,418
Niko is going to hide in a gorilla costume

344
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:06,694
and then bury himself in these packing peanuts

345
00:09:06,694 --> 00:09:09,393
and then scare Collins, it's gonna be great.

346
00:09:09,393 --> 00:09:13,273
(House electro music)

347
00:09:13,273 --> 00:09:14,204
- Yo, this is crazy

348
00:09:14,204 --> 00:09:16,125
Okay so let's uh, let's check out Ben's car now,

349
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:17,445
let's see what's going on over here.

350
00:09:17,445 --> 00:09:20,624
- I don't think I wanna change it actually it's grown on me.

351
00:09:20,624 --> 00:09:22,907
- Nice little color addition to it over here

352
00:09:22,907 --> 00:09:24,022
all right we're gonna start peeling

353
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:25,873
- No, no it's perfect

354
00:09:25,873 --> 00:09:26,956
- Broom power

355
00:09:28,493 --> 00:09:29,326
Peanut in my mouth

356
00:09:29,326 --> 00:09:31,327
All right, so I filled up half of Collins' room,

357
00:09:31,327 --> 00:09:33,634
now it's time to hide some of his prize possessions.

358
00:09:33,634 --> 00:09:36,369
So the first thing I'm going to hide in here is Collins'

359
00:09:36,369 --> 00:09:37,961
most prized possession. Can you guess what it is?

360
00:09:37,961 --> 00:09:39,684
It's his sunscreen. This boy's pale.

361
00:09:39,684 --> 00:09:40,517
Alright, there we go.

362
00:09:40,517 --> 00:09:41,543
Boom! It's gone

363
00:09:41,543 --> 00:09:42,376
- All right, let me do this,

364
00:09:42,376 --> 00:09:43,209
we're going to head back to the house.

365
00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:44,355
Grab Devan, so we can help you guys clean this up.

366
00:09:44,355 --> 00:09:45,303
So I'll be, I'll be right back.

367
00:09:45,303 --> 00:09:46,893
- Yo dude, I think Collins is almost here.

368
00:09:46,893 --> 00:09:48,818
I'm just going to leave you in here. You got this?

369
00:09:48,818 --> 00:09:49,651
- Got it

370
00:09:51,901 --> 00:09:53,558
- Anyone have a large vacuum?

371
00:09:53,558 --> 00:09:54,420
- Yo Cons, where are you at?

372
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,686
- [Cons] Yo so I'm on my way home right now actually

373
00:09:55,686 --> 00:09:57,645
- No, no, no, no, no, wait, don't come over here Cons.

374
00:09:57,645 --> 00:10:00,545
Cons you should go to Alexis's house first and prank her.

375
00:10:00,545 --> 00:10:02,293
Cause I think you've got a couple hours left in the day and

376
00:10:02,293 --> 00:10:04,046
then you should go prank the twins again.

377
00:10:04,046 --> 00:10:05,835
Cause they said that they're going to be suntanning later

378
00:10:05,835 --> 00:10:07,133
- Oh dude that would be hilarious.

379
00:10:07,133 --> 00:10:08,768
- Yeah, yeah. So go, go, go, go

380
00:10:08,768 --> 00:10:09,756
(Horns)

381
00:10:09,756 --> 00:10:12,314
- Alright. As Devin suggested I'm at Alexa's house right now

382
00:10:12,314 --> 00:10:13,818
and this next prank is going to get pretty messy because

383
00:10:13,818 --> 00:10:15,669
my friend Alexis back there, she's actually one of

384
00:10:15,669 --> 00:10:17,817
the top 20 tennis players in the entire state of California,

385
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:20,007
and this is a normal tennis ball and this is a pigment

386
00:10:20,007 --> 00:10:21,558
popper. Basically when you hit this thing,

387
00:10:21,558 --> 00:10:22,501
pigment goes everywhere.

388
00:10:22,501 --> 00:10:23,579
It's like a hundred degrees outside.

389
00:10:23,579 --> 00:10:25,388
I'm sweating let's go play some tennis.

390
00:10:25,388 --> 00:10:26,662
All right what's up, Alexis?

391
00:10:26,662 --> 00:10:27,495
How are you doing? All right.

392
00:10:27,495 --> 00:10:28,438
Cool. So I've come over here.

393
00:10:28,438 --> 00:10:29,731
I want to test your tennis skills.

394
00:10:29,731 --> 00:10:30,881
- Oh, okay.

395
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:31,839
I heard your like freshman year,

396
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,143
you went like 31 to zero, right?

397
00:10:34,143 --> 00:10:36,018
- Yeah, I know, kinda crazy.

398
00:10:36,018 --> 00:10:37,318
That's impressive. But you haven't faced me yet.

399
00:10:37,318 --> 00:10:38,151
A true tennis champ.

400
00:10:38,151 --> 00:10:38,984
- Oof

401
00:10:38,984 --> 00:10:40,469
- Here we go. We'll go with the first one.

402
00:10:40,469 --> 00:10:42,043
(Collins laughing)

403
00:10:42,043 --> 00:10:42,876
That was close!

404
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:45,223
Okay. That was a little bit too close for comfort.

405
00:10:45,223 --> 00:10:46,056
Okay, cool.

406
00:10:46,056 --> 00:10:47,283
How about this I got one more ball. And Let's try this.

407
00:10:47,283 --> 00:10:49,120
So basically I want to see how your serve is.

408
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,968
I'm gonna lob it to you, so kinda like mess it up.

409
00:10:50,968 --> 00:10:51,959
How about this want to take it?

410
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:52,792
Yep. Yep.

411
00:10:52,792 --> 00:10:53,625
Go for it. I'm just going to hop over here.

412
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:54,458
Yep. Yeah.

413
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:56,391
Go for it yeah. Nice, nice big serve on it.

414
00:10:56,391 --> 00:10:57,224
Oh!

415
00:10:58,349 --> 00:10:59,182
Yes!

416
00:10:59,182 --> 00:11:00,015
Yo come on over here.

417
00:11:00,015 --> 00:11:02,707
We're doing a pranks video man.

418
00:11:02,707 --> 00:11:03,687
- My outfit!

419
00:11:03,687 --> 00:11:04,520
- I'm sorry.

420
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,199
- Oh my God. It kinda looks good though

421
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:07,441
- I thought, you got a get a pink shirt.

422
00:11:07,441 --> 00:11:08,411
It might match.

423
00:11:08,411 --> 00:11:09,262
Exactly.

424
00:11:09,262 --> 00:11:10,960
So thank you for being a part of it.

425
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,297
Well basically today. I'm just going to prank

426
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:13,130
all my friends.

427
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,750
It is so hot. I'm sweating.

428
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,553
- I know. You want me to go grab you a drink?

429
00:11:16,553 --> 00:11:17,386
- Yeah that'd be great.

430
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:18,474
- Yeah, I, I got you, I got you.

431
00:11:18,474 --> 00:11:19,307
- Alright, so we'll get everything

432
00:11:19,307 --> 00:11:20,532
wrapped up right now and cleaned up.

433
00:11:20,532 --> 00:11:22,938
- All right. So Collins thinks I'm getting him a Gatorade,

434
00:11:22,938 --> 00:11:24,508
but I'll pull a fake Gatorade prank on him.

435
00:11:24,508 --> 00:11:27,489
I am going to dump out the real Gatorade and fill it with

436
00:11:27,489 --> 00:11:29,304
Mac and cheese powder and water.

437
00:11:29,304 --> 00:11:30,259
- Dude. This is a mess.

438
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:32,589
- All right, I'm gonna fill this up with some water.

439
00:11:32,589 --> 00:11:36,545
Now it is time to add the Mac and cheese powder. Ooh, Ooh.

440
00:11:36,545 --> 00:11:37,559
This is going to be nice.

441
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:39,039
Okay guys, the fake Gatorade is ready.

442
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:40,611
Let's go take it out and see his reaction.

443
00:11:40,611 --> 00:11:41,896
- It is hot today, man.

444
00:11:41,896 --> 00:11:43,548
I think it's literally over a hundred degrees right now.

445
00:11:43,548 --> 00:11:44,424
- Okay Collins, here you go.

446
00:11:44,424 --> 00:11:45,257
- Thank you

447
00:11:45,257 --> 00:11:46,090
- It's a drink.

448
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:46,923
- How long have you been playing tennis for?

449
00:11:46,923 --> 00:11:48,975
- Well I've been playing tennis for like 12 years.

450
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:50,101
Oh!

451
00:11:50,101 --> 00:11:52,261
And you just got pranked.

452
00:11:52,261 --> 00:11:54,125
- That was you? What no way!

453
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:54,958
- I had to get you back.

454
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:56,105
- Is there like actual Gatorade anywhere?

455
00:11:56,105 --> 00:11:57,035
- Yeah, here you go.

456
00:11:57,035 --> 00:11:58,243
- [Collins] It's 03:45 in the afternoon.

457
00:11:58,243 --> 00:12:00,782
And just as Devin suggested it's time for our next prank

458
00:12:00,782 --> 00:12:02,656
because our friends, Lindsey, Nina are currently tanning.

459
00:12:02,656 --> 00:12:04,819
So we're going to hit them with a ton of big bird goop.

460
00:12:04,819 --> 00:12:06,766
Plus we've got Nico in a ghillie suit over here.

461
00:12:06,766 --> 00:12:08,940
He's going to swim through the pool, super sneaky,

462
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:09,896
and then jump out and scare them real bad.

463
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,478
So right now let's get into position

464
00:12:12,478 --> 00:12:15,145
Three, two, one, go, go, go, go.

465
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:21,759
I think they're like sleeping.

466
00:12:27,435 --> 00:12:30,435
(Suspenseful music)

467
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:44,763
We're in position.

468
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:49,680
Niko go get ready to get in the pool right now. Go, go, go.

469
00:12:51,862 --> 00:12:53,169
He's going to be scaring them.

00:12:53,169 --> 00:12:54,330
We also have the yeet cannons,

471
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:56,846

472
00:12:56,846 --> 00:12:57,679
here's what's going to happen.

473
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:58,626
I'm going to fire this thing off

474
00:12:58,626 --> 00:13:00,023
and you're going to jump out of the water

475
00:13:00,023 --> 00:13:01,750
You got it. Let's do this thing.

489
00:13:23,119 --> 00:13:25,133
(Gunshot)

490
00:13:25,133 --> 00:13:27,665
- Oh my gosh, eww that's disgusting

491
00:13:27,665 --> 00:13:30,182
(girls scream)

492
00:13:30,182 --> 00:13:31,859
- Oh my gosh. I'm so sorry.

493
00:13:31,859 --> 00:13:34,094
That's Niko dressed up as a swamp thing.

494
00:13:34,094 --> 00:13:35,109
Sorry again for pranking you

495
00:13:35,109 --> 00:13:36,235
I'll let you guys get back to tanning.

496
00:13:36,235 --> 00:13:37,068
See you guys later.

497
00:13:37,068 --> 00:13:38,458
- [Devan] Bro, I can't believe you got here

498
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:39,403
before Collins did.

499
00:13:39,403 --> 00:13:40,866
We gotta finish this thing up. Dude I think

500
00:13:40,866 --> 00:13:43,265
Collins is going to smell like packing peanuts for a week.

501
00:13:43,265 --> 00:13:45,274
Dude I feel like I could sleep in this room.

502
00:13:45,274 --> 00:13:46,826
Just like on the top here, man.

503
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,631
It's like the best bed ever.

504
00:13:48,631 --> 00:13:49,783
- You're going to have plenty of cushion.

505
00:13:49,783 --> 00:13:53,027
- I do. I cannot wait to see Collins' reaction.

506
00:13:53,027 --> 00:13:53,861
- This place is packed.

507
00:13:53,861 --> 00:13:56,501
- Oh man, I think I can hear him pulling up.

508
00:13:56,501 --> 00:13:59,106
We got to get this stuff inside really quickly.

509
00:13:59,106 --> 00:14:00,345
I feel like if I'm making no progress,

510
00:14:00,345 --> 00:14:01,435
I'm just getting really tired.

511
00:14:01,435 --> 00:14:03,166
I'm going to be so out of breath when he gets here,

512
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:04,287
I hope I don't give it away.

513
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:07,305
Oh man. Oh man. Oh man, man, I spent so much money on this.

514
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:08,274
I can't ruin it now.

515
00:14:08,274 --> 00:14:13,232
I got to figure out how to close this door. Get it in.

516
00:14:13,232 --> 00:14:14,065
Get in!

517
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:19,012
Oh I think he's here. I think Collins is here.

518
00:14:19,012 --> 00:14:20,323
Oh, hey Collins, how'd it go?

519
00:14:20,323 --> 00:14:21,907
- Why are the cameras here?

520
00:14:21,907 --> 00:14:22,794
- What do you mean?

521
00:14:22,794 --> 00:14:23,737
We're just shooting a vlog.

522
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:25,044
- I thought the video was over

523
00:14:25,044 --> 00:14:26,647
- It is. It's a vlog bro

524
00:14:26,647 --> 00:14:29,191
- No it is not. It's a pranks video. Like seriously.

525
00:14:29,191 --> 00:14:31,879
- What are you doing? Don't attack our plants bro.

526
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:33,899
- It could've the bushman guy. He's like, Niko.

527
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:36,548
why would you spill a blog at like the end of like the day?

528
00:14:36,548 --> 00:14:38,561
- Because we want to show like behind the scenes

529
00:14:38,561 --> 00:14:39,498
our lives, what we do.

530
00:14:39,498 --> 00:14:40,667
- This is definitely a prank.

531
00:14:40,667 --> 00:14:43,856
- It's 24 hours of pranks. Your pranks are over.

532
00:14:43,856 --> 00:14:46,711
You've got no more pranks. There's nothing there.

533
00:14:46,711 --> 00:14:47,588
- All right, let me do this.

534
00:14:47,588 --> 00:14:48,421
So if we're going to like vlog.

535
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:49,422
I'm going to like change into something else now.

536
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:50,255
- But where are you going?

537
00:14:50,255 --> 00:14:51,088
- I tripped on the stairs.

538
00:14:51,088 --> 00:14:51,985
- Why are you going upstairs?

539
00:14:51,985 --> 00:14:53,269
- Cause I know there's a prank man.

540
00:14:53,269 --> 00:14:54,134
- There's no prank

541
00:14:54,134 --> 00:14:56,092
- There's definitely a prank.

542
00:14:56,092 --> 00:14:58,186
I feel like you're extra interested in my room.

543
00:14:58,186 --> 00:15:00,387
- I'm not, I'm not interested in your room at all.

544
00:15:00,387 --> 00:15:01,987
Look, I'm not interested, just going to.

545
00:15:01,987 --> 00:15:04,069
- Alright. Well let me open up the door then

546
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:04,992
look at that look.

547
00:15:04,992 --> 00:15:05,825
- What look?

548
00:15:05,825 --> 00:15:06,658
- The look on the way back,

549
00:15:06,658 --> 00:15:08,142
Dude, you better not have done anything to my room.

550
00:15:08,142 --> 00:15:09,870
- What do you mean what could I do to your room?

551
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:10,808
- You know, I love my room bro.

552
00:15:10,808 --> 00:15:13,200
I sleep in my room. I do work in here.

553
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,033
- You do

554
00:15:14,033 --> 00:15:15,300
- There's a dirty fingerprint.

555
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,724
- Dirty fingerprint? I don't have dirty fingers.

556
00:15:16,724 --> 00:15:18,161
I wash my hands on the daily.

557
00:15:18,161 --> 00:15:19,867
- My door is usually very clean

558
00:15:19,867 --> 00:15:22,184
and there are literally dirty fingerprints all over.

559
00:15:22,184 --> 00:15:23,293
What did you do to my room?

560
00:15:23,293 --> 00:15:24,839
- I don't know what you're talking about, bro.

561
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:26,413
I think you're just paranoid.

562
00:15:26,413 --> 00:15:28,306
There's not any, I didn't say that.

563
00:15:28,306 --> 00:15:29,732
What are you listening for?

564
00:15:29,732 --> 00:15:31,270
(Suspenseful music)

565
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,907
There's nothing there bro.

566
00:15:32,907 --> 00:15:35,739
- If someone's in there. Leave!

567
00:15:35,739 --> 00:15:36,944
- You think that something's going on,

568
00:15:36,944 --> 00:15:37,949
but nothing's going on?

569
00:15:37,949 --> 00:15:39,986
- Devan, there're two cameras.

570
00:15:39,986 --> 00:15:41,444
- I know we're shooting a vlog.

571
00:15:41,444 --> 00:15:43,989
- That's not how you vlog, a vlog is like this.

572
00:15:43,989 --> 00:15:45,011
This is different.

573
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:45,857
Someone is hiding here.

574
00:15:45,857 --> 00:15:47,076
I think I'm just going to have go for it.

575
00:15:47,076 --> 00:15:47,982
Let's go into the room. Here we go.

576
00:15:47,982 --> 00:15:49,315
Three, two, one.

577
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:52,827
What the heck?

578
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:54,251
- What? You can't open your own room.

579
00:15:54,251 --> 00:15:55,733
- What'd you do to the room?

580
00:15:55,733 --> 00:15:57,258
- You're just messing with me bro.

581
00:15:57,258 --> 00:15:58,908
I didn't do anything to your room

582
00:15:58,908 --> 00:16:00,115
Wait dude you can't actually open it.

583
00:16:00,115 --> 00:16:01,978
- No, you want to?

584
00:16:01,978 --> 00:16:05,746
What did you? You smack your head on the door?

585
00:16:05,746 --> 00:16:06,579
- Yeah.

586
00:16:06,579 --> 00:16:07,412
- Is that a prank?

587
00:16:07,412 --> 00:16:08,690
- No, that's a welt

588
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:10,501
- Alright. I think I'll give it a shot.

589
00:16:10,501 --> 00:16:11,672
We'll see if I can open this thing up.

590
00:16:11,672 --> 00:16:13,679
For your sake. Let's hope there's no prank in here now.

591
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:14,512
- Seriously.

592
00:16:14,512 --> 00:16:15,345
What does that mean?

593
00:16:15,345 --> 00:16:16,178
Is that a threat?

594
00:16:16,178 --> 00:16:17,620
- All right here we go, three, two, one.

595
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,037
What! No, no, no.

596
00:16:22,264 --> 00:16:24,582
You filled my room with packing peanuts.

597
00:16:24,582 --> 00:16:25,415
- I did

598
00:16:25,415 --> 00:16:27,309
- Yo you get back back here bro, get back here.

599
00:16:27,309 --> 00:16:28,488
- Dude, I'm the best man.

600
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,666
- Are you kidding me?

601
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:31,914
You know what, I gotta give it to you bro

602
00:16:31,914 --> 00:16:34,354
I think it's the best prank that we've ever done on the

603
00:16:34,354 --> 00:16:35,187
channel.

604
00:16:35,187 --> 00:16:38,366
I'm very mad, but yet very impressed at the same time.

605
00:16:38,366 --> 00:16:39,879
How much did you spend on this prank?

606
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:41,079
- Too much.

607
00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:43,985
- I literally can't even open my door, man.

608
00:16:43,985 --> 00:16:46,008
- Don't forget, the gorilla's about to scare him.

609
00:16:46,008 --> 00:16:47,329
You're about to break that door bro.

610
00:16:47,329 --> 00:16:48,746
Just jump in Bro.

611
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:53,570
- Holy cow. This is insane.

612
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:56,984
Dude, this is like a winter wonderland man. Like Holy cow.

613
00:16:56,984 --> 00:16:58,112
- I want to jump in

614
00:16:58,112 --> 00:16:59,195
- Come on in

615
00:16:59,195 --> 00:17:01,319
- Three, two, one, yeet!

616
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:02,368
What did you actually leave in here?

617
00:17:02,368 --> 00:17:04,726
Like what's been actually taken out?

618
00:17:04,726 --> 00:17:05,559
- You'll have to find out.

619
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:06,873
- Dude I have some very fragile stuff in here

620
00:17:06,873 --> 00:17:07,908
I do not want broken.

621
00:17:07,908 --> 00:17:11,593
- Yeah. You had like the weird monkey in here too.

622
00:17:11,593 --> 00:17:13,903
- Yo if you did something to the laughing monkey bro,

623
00:17:13,903 --> 00:17:14,986
you are gone.

624
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:19,653
(Monkey screaming)

625
00:17:20,788 --> 00:17:21,985
- I want to submerge myself,

626
00:17:21,985 --> 00:17:23,351
give myself a little wiggle down.

627
00:17:23,351 --> 00:17:24,768
Woo let's go man.

628
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,128
Let's go man, let's go!

629
00:17:29,177 --> 00:17:30,582
It's absolutely insane.

630
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:32,566
(Collins screaming)

631
00:17:32,566 --> 00:17:35,688
- Holy cow! You were in here the whole time?

632
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:36,521
- Whole time

633
00:17:36,521 --> 00:17:40,872
- You must be sweating dude. Is that Niko?

634
00:17:40,872 --> 00:17:43,037
- All right Niko let's bounce, Collins has to clean up.

635
00:17:43,037 --> 00:17:44,706
- I seriously have to clean this whole thing up?

636
00:17:44,706 --> 00:17:45,659
- Oh yeah all by yourself.

637
00:17:45,659 --> 00:17:46,559
- I thought you were just Joking bro.

638
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:47,392
Well got to say this was the

639
00:17:47,392 --> 00:17:50,099
