1
00:00:00,812 --> 00:00:03,529
- You challenged us to real food into candy food.

2
00:00:03,529 --> 00:00:05,051
We've got the largest rice krispie treat

3
00:00:05,051 --> 00:00:07,303
in the entire world.

4
00:00:07,303 --> 00:00:09,136
Right now we're making

5
00:00:10,397 --> 00:00:12,822
The first thing we're making is sashimi and sushi.

6
00:00:12,822 --> 00:00:13,655
(bell dings)

7
00:00:13,655 --> 00:00:15,772
- Woohoo! (laughing)

8
00:00:15,772 --> 00:00:17,497
- I knew it was going to go into my face.

9
00:00:17,497 --> 00:00:18,665
- This is going to be a competition right now.

10
00:00:18,665 --> 00:00:19,498
Yeet!

11
00:00:19,498 --> 00:00:21,073
We are going to be battling each other, so to do this

12
00:00:21,073 --> 00:00:22,413
we need to break this in half.

13
00:00:22,413 --> 00:00:23,246
- Wait, what?

14
00:00:23,246 --> 00:00:24,079
No we don't.

15
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:24,912
- Yes we do, we need to

16
00:00:24,912 --> 00:00:25,745
break this in half.

17
00:00:25,745 --> 00:00:26,578
- Why?

18
00:00:26,578 --> 00:00:27,411
Because we each get a half.

19
00:00:27,411 --> 00:00:28,789
- Well, yeah.

20
00:00:28,789 --> 00:00:29,946
Just give a little cut right there for me.

21
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:31,621
- All right, hold it up.

22
00:00:31,621 --> 00:00:32,896
- Done, done, done, stop.

23
00:00:32,896 --> 00:00:33,740
Augh!

24
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:34,573
Let the competition, begin!

25
00:00:34,573 --> 00:00:35,406
(bell rings)

26
00:00:35,406 --> 00:00:36,239
All right.

27
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:37,072
- Wait, what are you doing?

28
00:00:37,072 --> 00:00:37,905
- I'm grabbing this, bro.

29
00:00:37,905 --> 00:00:38,738
- We're starting already? All right.

30
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:39,571
- Yes, we're starting already, bro.

31
00:00:39,571 --> 00:00:40,404
- Well I'm starting with the Rice Krispies,

32
00:00:40,404 --> 00:00:41,237
I'm going to cut it like this.

33
00:00:41,237 --> 00:00:42,070
Really?

34
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:43,496
That's your thing now.

35
00:00:43,496 --> 00:00:44,329
Isn't it?

36
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:45,162
- Yep.

37
00:00:45,162 --> 00:00:45,995
All right here we go, we've got to unwrap this.

38
00:00:45,995 --> 00:00:46,828
- Hmm!

39
00:00:46,828 --> 00:00:47,694
We're going to cut this in half now.

40
00:00:47,694 --> 00:00:48,582
- It works!

41
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:50,224
- Nope, dude you just bumped me.

42
00:00:50,224 --> 00:00:51,057
- Woohoo!

43
00:00:51,057 --> 00:00:51,890
(laughs)

44
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:52,723
Sorry.

45
00:00:52,723 --> 00:00:53,586
- (laughing) What are you doing?

46
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:54,457
- I'm distracting the competition.

47
00:00:54,457 --> 00:00:56,091
- You're not distracting me at all, actually.

48
00:00:56,091 --> 00:00:57,847
This is, I'm very focused.

49
00:00:57,847 --> 00:00:58,680
Kind of.

50
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,871
(laughing)

51
00:00:59,871 --> 00:01:02,253
I'm grinding it out, like I'm pushing it down.

52
00:01:02,253 --> 00:01:03,250
All right, this is nice.

53
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,083
I like rolling this.

54
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:05,796
- It's now becoming a sushi roll, because he's

55
00:01:05,796 --> 00:01:07,508
literally rolling the rice krispie into sushis.

56
00:01:07,508 --> 00:01:10,224
- It actually turned out pretty well.

57
00:01:10,224 --> 00:01:12,669
- See this is now a perimeter around my roll,

58
00:01:12,669 --> 00:01:13,698
- It's like a tablet.

59
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:15,318
- Yo, it's called the iPad roll.

60
00:01:15,318 --> 00:01:16,151
Oh, there's gotta be a different color.

61
00:01:16,151 --> 00:01:17,484
It's kinda ugly.

62
00:01:18,961 --> 00:01:20,111
- We've got, as you know the most important part

63
00:01:20,111 --> 00:01:21,931
of sushi is the fee-ush.

64
00:01:21,931 --> 00:01:22,764
- The what?

65
00:01:22,764 --> 00:01:23,597
- The fee-ush.

66
00:01:23,597 --> 00:01:24,809
I got some Swedish fish, yeet!

67
00:01:24,809 --> 00:01:25,642
- Jesus.

68
00:01:25,642 --> 00:01:27,093
Oh no!

69
00:01:27,093 --> 00:01:28,451
- You've got to be kidding me.

70
00:01:28,451 --> 00:01:29,835
- Oh this sticks to it nicely.

71
00:01:29,835 --> 00:01:30,953
Ooh I like this.

72
00:01:30,953 --> 00:01:32,174
- You know my perimeter of greatness

73
00:01:32,174 --> 00:01:34,541
is unprecedented in the sushi industry.

74
00:01:34,541 --> 00:01:37,331
- All right, it is time for me to begin the rolls.

75
00:01:37,331 --> 00:01:38,384
- Oh that's so cool!

76
00:01:38,384 --> 00:01:39,908
Why did I not think of that?

77
00:01:39,908 --> 00:01:41,576
Mine's not even a sushi roll, it's like sushimi

78
00:01:41,576 --> 00:01:42,994
but just to the max.

79
00:01:42,994 --> 00:01:43,827
- It's what?

80
00:01:43,827 --> 00:01:45,559
- Sushimi, sushimi, soo shee me.

81
00:01:45,559 --> 00:01:47,700
- Dude, it's not even close to sushimi.

82
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,822
- What, you're cutting off a slice of it?

83
00:01:48,822 --> 00:01:49,655
- Yeah.

84
00:01:49,655 --> 00:01:50,488
Gotta cut off all this rice.

85
00:01:50,488 --> 00:01:52,008
- This is so much fun, I love candy,

86
00:01:52,008 --> 00:01:53,720
and the fact that we're actually trying to make,

87
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,890
well I'm not, I'm not, I'm doing my best,

88
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:57,627
trying to make real food into candy, this is super cool.

89
00:01:57,627 --> 00:01:58,998
It's looking more like a burrito roll than it is

90
00:01:58,998 --> 00:02:00,129
like a sushi roll.

91
00:02:00,129 --> 00:02:01,499
- Uh-uh, trust me, it'll look like a sushi.

92
00:02:01,499 --> 00:02:02,963
- Bro, I actually might win this round, because this one's

93
00:02:02,963 --> 00:02:03,848
looking pretty saucy.

94
00:02:03,848 --> 00:02:05,201
- Ooh, yeah, this is turning out good.

95
00:02:05,201 --> 00:02:07,690
Dude, your elbow's literally in my face.

96
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:08,861
It is time to cut it,

97
00:02:08,861 --> 00:02:10,695
but I don't think this knife is gonna cut it.

98
00:02:10,695 --> 00:02:11,592
(rim shot)

99
00:02:11,592 --> 00:02:12,425
so I'll be right back.

100
00:02:12,425 --> 00:02:13,258
- Did you really just say that? (laughs)

101
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,419
- [Devon] I did, yep.

102
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:16,252
- Hopefully the last,

103
00:02:16,252 --> 00:02:18,339
or else you'll have a punishment.

104
00:02:18,339 --> 00:02:21,132
(trumpet wails sadly)

105
00:02:21,132 --> 00:02:22,320
- I'm almost done, I just have to

106
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,358
cut these into little pieces.

107
00:02:24,358 --> 00:02:25,454
- Well mine's almost done as well.

108
00:02:25,454 --> 00:02:27,218
All I need to do now is the fee-ush.

109
00:02:27,218 --> 00:02:28,051
- Dude.

110
00:02:28,051 --> 00:02:29,270
- That looks really cool.

111
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,103
- Oh!

112
00:02:30,103 --> 00:02:31,283
See the light shines through it and everything.

113
00:02:31,283 --> 00:02:32,498
- Ooh. The light's shining.

114
00:02:32,498 --> 00:02:33,331
That's crazy!

115
00:02:33,331 --> 00:02:34,164
- Cool.

116
00:02:34,164 --> 00:02:35,382
- My sushi roll is coming together

117
00:02:35,382 --> 00:02:36,987
incredibly right now.

118
00:02:36,987 --> 00:02:38,426
We've got all the Swedish fish on here,

119
00:02:38,426 --> 00:02:40,655
and it's only missing one element.

120
00:02:40,655 --> 00:02:41,488
Skittles.

121
00:02:41,488 --> 00:02:42,321
Yeet!

122
00:02:42,321 --> 00:02:43,154
And how about this?

123
00:02:43,154 --> 00:02:44,405
You guys get to decide what our sushi rolls

124
00:02:44,405 --> 00:02:45,238
are named.

125
00:02:45,238 --> 00:02:46,071
- Ooh, yes.

126
00:02:46,071 --> 00:02:46,904
- No, no!

127
00:02:46,904 --> 00:02:47,737
I have an idea.

128
00:02:47,737 --> 00:02:48,570
- What?

129
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:49,403
- I only want to use a certain

130
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:51,413
color scheme because I make awesome things.

131
00:02:51,413 --> 00:02:53,496
- Ooh, skittles, woo-hoo!

132
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,813
- Got grape, I got grape.

133
00:02:56,813 --> 00:02:59,350
Yo, my roll is absolutely gorgeous, Devon.

134
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,183
All right, the big reveal.

135
00:03:00,183 --> 00:03:01,133
Three, two, one.

136
00:03:01,133 --> 00:03:02,021
Ta da!

137
00:03:02,021 --> 00:03:02,854
(organ plays chord)

138
00:03:02,854 --> 00:03:03,687
- Whoa!

139
00:03:03,687 --> 00:03:04,813
- This is the chef's special rolls.

140
00:03:04,813 --> 00:03:06,522
You guys know when you're order at a restaurant,

141
00:03:06,522 --> 00:03:08,942
takes a super long time, like an hour?

142
00:03:08,942 --> 00:03:10,471
They're creating a masterpiece.

143
00:03:10,471 --> 00:03:11,854
Like this.

144
00:03:11,854 --> 00:03:13,578
- Just to clarify, it's not really a roll,

145
00:03:13,578 --> 00:03:14,703
it's more like a cake.

146
00:03:14,703 --> 00:03:15,536
- So here's how it works.

147
00:03:15,536 --> 00:03:16,833
You've got wrapping around the outside,

148
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:18,378
the marshmallows are kind of like the rice,

149
00:03:18,378 --> 00:03:19,676
and this is the filling within it.

150
00:03:19,676 --> 00:03:21,878
It's a little abstract, you just have to kinda go with it.

151
00:03:21,878 --> 00:03:23,318
- Oh that, oh!

152
00:03:23,318 --> 00:03:24,151
- Aaugh!

153
00:03:24,151 --> 00:03:24,984
- Oh that's awesome!

154
00:03:24,984 --> 00:03:25,817
Wait, uh, oops.

155
00:03:25,817 --> 00:03:28,224
- I know, I'm from (muddled talking).

156
00:03:28,224 --> 00:03:29,297
And now.

157
00:03:29,297 --> 00:03:30,426
- What is goin' on?

158
00:03:30,426 --> 00:03:33,131
- It's time for the super special surprise element.

159
00:03:33,131 --> 00:03:33,964
You ready for it?

160
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:34,797
- Yeah, I'm ready.

161
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:35,841
- Whoo!

162
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:37,057
- No, no, no, no,

163
00:03:37,057 --> 00:03:37,935
You can't do that.

164
00:03:37,935 --> 00:03:39,438
- Have you seen the fancy restaurants though, bro?

165
00:03:39,438 --> 00:03:40,271
- No!

166
00:03:41,203 --> 00:03:42,036
Put it down.

167
00:03:42,036 --> 00:03:42,878
- Now, how else do I heat it up?

168
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:43,750
- Put it down.

169
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,583
Uh, microwave?

170
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:45,416
- Alright, here we go.

171
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:46,633
Gotta transport it very carefully.

172
00:03:46,633 --> 00:03:47,651
I'm excited to see this.

173
00:03:47,651 --> 00:03:50,984
(old-time parlor music)

174
00:03:54,478 --> 00:03:56,461
- [Collins] Oh, my gosh!

175
00:03:56,461 --> 00:03:57,294
- [Devon] Whoa, wait!

176
00:03:57,294 --> 00:03:59,143
- [Collins] What the heck happened?

177
00:03:59,143 --> 00:03:59,976
- [Devon] Bro!

178
00:03:59,976 --> 00:04:00,809
- [Collins] My beauty!

179
00:04:00,809 --> 00:04:02,461
It's been destroyed, looks like a beast!

180
00:04:02,461 --> 00:04:03,944
It's gone from beauty to the beast!

181
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:04,815
Man, how did we do this?

182
00:04:04,815 --> 00:04:05,648
So, let's do this, Devon.

183
00:04:05,648 --> 00:04:06,504
You grab down here.

184
00:04:06,504 --> 00:04:07,617
- [Devon] No, I'm not involved in this.

185
00:04:07,617 --> 00:04:08,717
This is your masterpiece.

186
00:04:08,717 --> 00:04:09,550
- [Collins] How do I get it off?

187
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,383
Boom!

188
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:11,216
- [Devon] Whoa!

189
00:04:11,216 --> 00:04:12,546
- There it is, my sushi masterpiece.

190
00:04:12,546 --> 00:04:13,803
- That's interesting.

191
00:04:13,803 --> 00:04:14,636
- Yeah, yeah,

192
00:04:14,636 --> 00:04:15,721
that did not according to plan,

193
00:04:15,721 --> 00:04:17,020
and Devon, I heard in the meantime

194
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,821
you were making your own other piece of sushi?

195
00:04:18,821 --> 00:04:20,954
- I did, and this is what it looks like.

196
00:04:20,954 --> 00:04:22,537
- [Collins] That looks so close!

197
00:04:22,537 --> 00:04:23,370
- I know!

198
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,203
- That's incredible.

199
00:04:24,203 --> 00:04:25,036
- Yup, it's pretty close.

200
00:04:25,036 --> 00:04:27,293
I actually mixed Starburst together,

201
00:04:27,293 --> 00:04:28,363
all the orange ones.

202
00:04:28,363 --> 00:04:29,211
- This is the part of the video

203
00:04:29,211 --> 00:04:30,938
where we taste test our candy sushi.

204
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:33,867
I am so excited to see what this crazy thing tastes like,

205
00:04:33,867 --> 00:04:35,131
and actually, we're gonna be doing that

206
00:04:35,131 --> 00:04:36,226
at the end of the video,

207
00:04:36,226 --> 00:04:39,154
because we are locked in a heavy competition right now,

208
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:41,667
and you get to vote who won the first round,

209
00:04:41,667 --> 00:04:42,586
so comment down below.

210
00:04:42,586 --> 00:04:45,118
Did my sushi win, or Devon's sushi win?

211
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,597
- And when making your decision,

212
00:04:46,597 --> 00:04:48,826
take into account the presentation,

213
00:04:48,826 --> 00:04:51,195
the way it is presented on the plate.

214
00:04:51,195 --> 00:04:52,028
- Or don't!

215
00:04:52,028 --> 00:04:52,861
That's cool, too.

216
00:04:52,861 --> 00:04:53,694
- Just something to think about.

217
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:55,160
- What, don't even need to worry about that.

218
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,570
We're making the pasta with the meatballs

219
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:58,912
in the spaghetti sauce.

220
00:04:58,912 --> 00:05:00,475
I am so excited about this.

221
00:05:00,475 --> 00:05:01,344
- I can't wait.

222
00:05:01,344 --> 00:05:03,264
- How does one open this?

223
00:05:03,264 --> 00:05:04,097
- Dude, really?

224
00:05:04,097 --> 00:05:04,930
- Yeet!

225
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:05,927
- I did it perfectly.

226
00:05:05,927 --> 00:05:08,130
- How did, the heck is that?

227
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:08,963
Alright, here we go.

228
00:05:08,963 --> 00:05:09,907
three, two, one.

229
00:05:09,907 --> 00:05:10,740
Oh!

230
00:05:11,867 --> 00:05:12,700
That's awesome!

231
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,159
Yo, be careful with that, okay?

232
00:05:14,159 --> 00:05:14,992
- [Devon] Alright.

233
00:05:14,992 --> 00:05:16,578
- That's like super, super, super dangerous.

234
00:05:16,578 --> 00:05:17,411
Like, you might actually

235
00:05:17,411 --> 00:05:18,932
get really injured doing that, Devon.

236
00:05:18,932 --> 00:05:21,015
- [Narrator] Meanwhile...

237
00:05:22,242 --> 00:05:23,273
- Dude, what are you doing?

238
00:05:23,273 --> 00:05:26,424
That is not, that's way more unsafe than what I'm doing.

239
00:05:26,424 --> 00:05:27,307
- It's a sausage.

240
00:05:27,307 --> 00:05:28,405
- [Devon] Dude, what are you doing?

241
00:05:28,405 --> 00:05:29,905
- [Collins] Ta da!

242
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:31,992
- It's like a cheese stick.

243
00:05:31,992 --> 00:05:33,468
- And done.

244
00:05:33,468 --> 00:05:34,691
Alright, so my bowl of pasta's fully made.

245
00:05:34,691 --> 00:05:35,653
- Wait, how did you finish?

246
00:05:35,653 --> 00:05:36,486
What?

247
00:05:36,486 --> 00:05:37,319
- Bro, it was taking way too long,

248
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:38,152
and look at you.

249
00:05:38,152 --> 00:05:38,985
You're only on the first string.

250
00:05:38,985 --> 00:05:40,256
How many of those do you even need

251
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:41,488
to fill up an entire bowl?

252
00:05:41,488 --> 00:05:42,410
- Yeah, you know what?

253
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:43,391
I'm just gonna do that.

254
00:05:43,391 --> 00:05:44,224
- That's the way to go.

255
00:05:44,224 --> 00:05:45,057
- I'm done with this,

256
00:05:45,057 --> 00:05:46,423
although this would have looked really cool

257
00:05:46,423 --> 00:05:47,475
if I had more time.

258
00:05:47,475 --> 00:05:49,040
- The next step, my favorite one,

259
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,736
time to sauce it!

260
00:05:50,736 --> 00:05:51,805
You gotta mix up your jam first.

261
00:05:51,805 --> 00:05:52,638
- Oh, yeah.

262
00:05:52,638 --> 00:05:53,802
You gotta do that, that's the jam.

263
00:05:53,802 --> 00:05:54,635
- That's the jam.

264
00:05:54,635 --> 00:05:56,029
Time to sauce my pasta.

265
00:05:56,029 --> 00:05:57,402
Ooh!

266
00:05:57,402 --> 00:05:58,741
Now, I got to up my ummy!

267
00:05:58,741 --> 00:05:59,574
Ah!

268
00:05:59,574 --> 00:06:00,407
- Whoa!

269
00:06:00,407 --> 00:06:01,240
- Oh, they broken open!

270
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,073
One of em broke open, dude!

271
00:06:02,073 --> 00:06:02,906
Oh, no!

272
00:06:02,906 --> 00:06:03,790
- I just had a genius idea.

273
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,333
Instead of just putting them in

274
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:07,272
normal and basic like Collins did,

275
00:06:07,272 --> 00:06:11,590
you can actually pull them out into longer strands.

276
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:13,899
Whoops, if you don't break it.

277
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:15,023
- Alright, so we're gonna pop this in here.

278
00:06:15,023 --> 00:06:15,856
Boom!

279
00:06:15,856 --> 00:06:16,814
There we go, meatball's complete.

280
00:06:16,814 --> 00:06:17,744
- Whoo!

281
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:18,577
- Oh, geesh!

282
00:06:18,577 --> 00:06:19,410
You almost hit me in the face.

283
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:20,243
You gotta watch your noodle, Devon!

284
00:06:20,243 --> 00:06:21,469
This final step, to me,

285
00:06:21,469 --> 00:06:23,240
is what really takes this to the next level,

286
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,476
because you know, on every pasta,

287
00:06:24,476 --> 00:06:25,915
you gotta have some cheese.

288
00:06:25,915 --> 00:06:26,748
- Yup.

289
00:06:26,748 --> 00:06:29,577
- This here is some beautiful white chocolate.

290
00:06:29,577 --> 00:06:31,326
Here we go, time to cheese,

291
00:06:31,326 --> 00:06:33,306
or in this case, chocolate my pasta.

292
00:06:33,306 --> 00:06:35,750
Ooh, that's so satisfying!

293
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,798
- [Devon] Whoa!

294
00:06:36,798 --> 00:06:37,673
- [Collins] Yo!

295
00:06:37,673 --> 00:06:39,678
- [Devon] That looks so good!

296
00:06:39,678 --> 00:06:40,850
- I'm like in the restaurant when they're like,

297
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:41,683
"Tell me when to stop."

298
00:06:41,683 --> 00:06:42,950
In this case, I would be like,

299
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,938
- I want them to do this on all pasta.

300
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:47,369
- [Collins] There we go, my bowl is done.

301
00:06:47,369 --> 00:06:48,831
This looks bomb.

302
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,345
- [Devon] See, I went really light on the sauce

303
00:06:50,345 --> 00:06:51,530
because you took a lot of sauce.

304
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:52,633
- Yeah, yeah, I did.

305
00:06:52,633 --> 00:06:53,782
- Ooh!

306
00:06:53,782 --> 00:06:56,782
- Bro, I've got a Twizzler mustache.

307
00:06:59,763 --> 00:07:01,179
Yo, that's awesome!

308
00:07:01,179 --> 00:07:03,012
Dude, you have like cheese all over yourself now,

309
00:07:03,012 --> 00:07:04,268
or chocolate all over yourself.

310
00:07:04,268 --> 00:07:05,101
- No problem.

311
00:07:05,101 --> 00:07:05,934
It's for later.

312
00:07:05,934 --> 00:07:06,888
Mine is all cheese.

313
00:07:06,888 --> 00:07:09,264
- Why not just put a slab of chocolate in there?

314
00:07:09,264 --> 00:07:10,555
- Well, I was already gonna do that.

315
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:13,193
See, mines is gonna be more delicious to eat than yours is,

316
00:07:13,193 --> 00:07:15,094
because it comes with this chocolate on the side

317
00:07:15,094 --> 00:07:16,326
just like that piece of bread,

318
00:07:16,326 --> 00:07:17,942
you know, that comes with it sometimes.

319
00:07:17,942 --> 00:07:18,775
Alright, well again,

320
00:07:18,775 --> 00:07:19,942
we're eating this at the end of the video.

321
00:07:19,942 --> 00:07:21,474
Right now, you guys get to vote down below,

322
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:23,982
who won this round of the candy pasta,

323
00:07:23,982 --> 00:07:25,823
and right now, on to the next one.

324
00:07:25,823 --> 00:07:27,706
You love em, we love em,

325
00:07:27,706 --> 00:07:30,393
we're making candy tacos!

326
00:07:30,393 --> 00:07:32,512
We got pancakes to act as the tor-till-as.

327
00:07:32,512 --> 00:07:34,578
- Yup, otherwise known as tortillas.

328
00:07:34,578 --> 00:07:35,411
- Tor-till-as.

329
00:07:35,411 --> 00:07:36,244
This is so clever.

330
00:07:36,244 --> 00:07:38,153
We have jelly beans as real beans.

331
00:07:38,153 --> 00:07:39,251
There we go, we got my beans.

332
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:40,084
Let me open this.

333
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:40,917
- Oh!

334
00:07:40,917 --> 00:07:41,948
- Not again!

335
00:07:41,948 --> 00:07:42,781
- Really?

336
00:07:42,781 --> 00:07:44,298
- This one's super cool because for the guacamole,

337
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:46,635
everyone loves guac, everyone knows guac is extra,

338
00:07:46,635 --> 00:07:48,538
but for this one, guac is not extra.

339
00:07:48,538 --> 00:07:51,101
Only my enthusiasm for the guac is extra.

340
00:07:51,101 --> 00:07:52,304
Nope, candy corn's inside there.

341
00:07:52,304 --> 00:07:53,810
Yeet!

342
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:54,643
- Nice.

343
00:07:54,643 --> 00:07:55,476
You should've caught it in your mouth.

344
00:07:55,476 --> 00:07:56,309
- Oh!

345
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,470
This is called the candy corn trick shot challenge.

346
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:58,303
- Yeah!

347
00:08:01,301 --> 00:08:02,340
- Wait, why'd you spit it out?

348
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,981
- Cause I wanna catch it on my spoon, but then I didn't.

349
00:08:03,981 --> 00:08:04,998
So, this will give me the guacamole.

350
00:08:04,998 --> 00:08:06,034
To make the guacamole--

351
00:08:06,034 --> 00:08:07,384
- I thought you just slammed that on the table.

352
00:08:07,384 --> 00:08:08,217
What?

353
00:08:08,217 --> 00:08:09,050
- I missed the bowl!

354
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:11,101
Next up is adding the food coloring.

355
00:08:11,101 --> 00:08:12,406
Be very careful, cause I feel like

356
00:08:12,406 --> 00:08:13,285
you're gonna get this everywhere.

357
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:14,632
Why don't we puncture it with a candy corn.

358
00:08:14,632 --> 00:08:15,852
- Yeah, that's not gonna work.

359
00:08:15,852 --> 00:08:16,758
- [Collins] Put it on the table.

360
00:08:16,758 --> 00:08:18,195
Oh!

361
00:08:18,195 --> 00:08:19,028
Dude!

362
00:08:19,028 --> 00:08:19,861
- [Devon] It actually worked.

363
00:08:19,861 --> 00:08:20,694
- [Collins] It's so sharp!

364
00:08:20,694 --> 00:08:21,527
Alright, here we go.

365
00:08:21,527 --> 00:08:22,445
So, now we're gonna add the green food coloring,

366
00:08:22,445 --> 00:08:24,078
and make some guacamole.

367
00:08:24,078 --> 00:08:25,108
- [Collins] Whoa, that was way too much.

368
00:08:25,108 --> 00:08:25,941
- Yup.

369
00:08:25,941 --> 00:08:26,893
Oh!

370
00:08:26,893 --> 00:08:27,896
Dude!

371
00:08:27,896 --> 00:08:28,729
- Oh, yeah!

372
00:08:28,729 --> 00:08:29,562
- Yeah!

373
00:08:29,562 --> 00:08:30,395
When I whip it through the top,

374
00:08:30,395 --> 00:08:31,228
white came together, man,

375
00:08:31,228 --> 00:08:32,061
and there's a glob on the table.

376
00:08:32,061 --> 00:08:33,262
Let's cop that real quick.

377
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:35,297
Oh, no, it's gonna spread around me.

378
00:08:35,297 --> 00:08:36,451
Make your mess.

379
00:08:36,451 --> 00:08:38,425
Yup, move the table.

380
00:08:38,425 --> 00:08:40,044
- [Narrator] Twenty minutes later...

381
00:08:40,044 --> 00:08:41,670
- [Collins] Yup, yup, yup.

382
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:42,503
Boom!

383
00:08:42,503 --> 00:08:45,028
- Alright, so we're gonna use these red Starburst.

384
00:08:45,028 --> 00:08:46,743
There's tomato, another tomato,

385
00:08:46,743 --> 00:08:49,201
another tomato, Kobe!

386
00:08:49,201 --> 00:08:50,411
Ooh, nailed it!

387
00:08:50,411 --> 00:08:51,742
- I think these are the only types of onions

388
00:08:51,742 --> 00:08:53,301
that will not make your breath smell bad.

389
00:08:53,301 --> 00:08:54,134
- Or make you cry.

390
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:55,102
- A drizzle of guac.

391
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:55,935
Ooh, okay.

392
00:08:56,927 --> 00:08:57,841
That's interesting.

393
00:08:57,841 --> 00:08:58,726
There's like the salsa.

394
00:08:58,726 --> 00:09:00,268
Jelly as salsa's awesome.

395
00:09:00,268 --> 00:09:02,601
Whipped cream as sour cream.

396
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:05,561
- Whoa, that was way too much!

397
00:09:05,561 --> 00:09:06,394
Might wanna rethink that.

398
00:09:06,394 --> 00:09:07,604
- It's really startin' to turn into a pancake a little bit,

399
00:09:07,604 --> 00:09:10,176
and then, of course gotta spritz it with some cheese,

400
00:09:10,176 --> 00:09:11,534
I mean coconut.

401
00:09:11,534 --> 00:09:13,160
- [Devon] I gotta add a little bit of salsa.

402
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,363
- Dude, I cannot wait any longer.

403
00:09:14,363 --> 00:09:16,331
I've got to eat this right now.

404
00:09:16,331 --> 00:09:17,271
So, for the rest of candies,

405
00:09:17,271 --> 00:09:18,652
we'll eat those at the end of the video,

406
00:09:18,652 --> 00:09:20,050
but right now, we are eating this taco,

407
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:21,304
so let's pick this thing up.

408
00:09:21,304 --> 00:09:22,417
- [Devon] Alright, let's do it.

409
00:09:22,417 --> 00:09:23,260
- Ooh, oh!

410
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,617
Yo, my taco is jam-packed!

411
00:09:25,617 --> 00:09:27,009
Alright, bout to take a bite of this.

412
00:09:27,009 --> 00:09:29,637
three, two, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

413
00:09:29,637 --> 00:09:30,752
First, we've got a challenge.

414
00:09:30,752 --> 00:09:32,868
We wanna see if you can subscribe to this channel,

415
00:09:32,868 --> 00:09:34,809
turn on the channel post notifications,

416
00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:37,815
and give this video a thumbs up in seven seconds.

417
00:09:37,815 --> 00:09:38,648
You ready for this?

418
00:09:38,648 --> 00:09:41,481
7, 6, 5, 4, three, two, one, done.

419
00:09:44,764 --> 00:09:45,908
If you can do that, comment down below

420
00:09:45,908 --> 00:09:47,158
"keyper squad" right now,

421
00:09:47,158 --> 00:09:48,795
and Devon, you ready to take a bite?

422
00:09:48,795 --> 00:09:49,822
- I'm so ready.

423
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:50,716
- Cheers, cheers for the tacos.

424
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:51,549
- Alright.

425
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,049
- three, two, one.

426
00:09:54,153 --> 00:09:54,986
Mmm.

427
00:09:57,832 --> 00:09:58,832
- So good.

428
00:09:58,832 --> 00:09:59,665
- Oh, my god.

429
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:01,820
- Oh, my goodness.

430
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,653
- Mhm!

431
00:10:03,921 --> 00:10:05,150
- I don't even wanna swallow this.

432
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,055
It's so delicious.

433
00:10:06,055 --> 00:10:07,105
I wanna chew it forever.

434
00:10:07,105 --> 00:10:07,938
Mmm.

435
00:10:07,938 --> 00:10:08,771
Alright, guys.

436
00:10:08,771 --> 00:10:09,998
Comment down below who won this round.

437
00:10:09,998 --> 00:10:11,380
We're gonna eat the rest of the candy

438
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,536
at the end of the video,

439
00:10:12,536 --> 00:10:14,721
but right now, I'm gonna eat the rest of this,

440
00:10:14,721 --> 00:10:16,167
and we're on to the next round.

441
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:17,139
- I'm the burger.

442
00:10:17,139 --> 00:10:18,082
- And I'm the bun,

443
00:10:18,082 --> 00:10:19,911
and today, we're making candy hamburgers,

444
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:22,149
but right now, the competition heats up.

445
00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:24,182
These are actually the buns for our burger.

446
00:10:24,182 --> 00:10:25,816
You're gonna need a super sharp knife,

447
00:10:25,816 --> 00:10:26,820
gonna cut mine in half.

448
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,966
- [Devon] So, be careful.

449
00:10:27,966 --> 00:10:31,512
Next up, we got the burger, or the patty.

450
00:10:31,512 --> 00:10:33,377
- Then, it's going to be the lettuce

451
00:10:33,377 --> 00:10:36,341
because this is some healthy lookin' lettuce, am I right?

452
00:10:36,341 --> 00:10:37,770
Next step, tomatoes,

453
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,008
which is gonna be these cherry Airheads.

454
00:10:40,008 --> 00:10:40,852
- And I'm going--

455
00:10:40,852 --> 00:10:41,685
- Cheese?

456
00:10:41,685 --> 00:10:42,518
- Yeah!

457
00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:43,351
This is cheese!

458
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:44,184
- Oh, that's a great idea.

459
00:10:44,184 --> 00:10:45,017
I'm getting my tomatoes on.

460
00:10:45,017 --> 00:10:45,850
Boom, there we go.

461
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,051
Alright, comin' together nicely.

462
00:10:47,051 --> 00:10:47,955
Ooh, ketchup.

463
00:10:47,955 --> 00:10:48,942
So, I can use this as ketchup.

464
00:10:48,942 --> 00:10:50,876
I think it's like frosting filling right now,

465
00:10:50,876 --> 00:10:53,153
so I'm just gonna kinda drizzle this onto the top.

466
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:53,986
Eww, there's a hair!

467
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,595
There's a hair!

468
00:10:55,595 --> 00:10:56,491
Contamination!

469
00:10:56,491 --> 00:10:58,626
Man, these brownies are tough to cut.

470
00:10:58,626 --> 00:11:00,663
This is the double cheese special,

471
00:11:00,663 --> 00:11:02,487
so you fold the Starburst in half.

472
00:11:02,487 --> 00:11:04,101
That's like twice the cheese.

473
00:11:04,101 --> 00:11:05,578
- So you fold it in half,

474
00:11:05,578 --> 00:11:07,324
and it's twice the cheese.

475
00:11:07,324 --> 00:11:12,013
Walk me through the math real quick on how that works.

476
00:11:12,013 --> 00:11:12,846
- Bacon!

477
00:11:12,846 --> 00:11:14,597
- Cause this looks more like bacon that lettuce.

478
00:11:14,597 --> 00:11:15,494
And this is where I win,

479
00:11:15,494 --> 00:11:18,803
cause see, my cheese is melting around my burger.

480
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:22,664
And I'm goin' for a double decker burger.

481
00:11:22,664 --> 00:11:23,830
The finishing touch for the burger,

482
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,818
a slight sprinkle.

483
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:26,726
It actually sticks!

484
00:11:26,726 --> 00:11:27,926
Ooh, that looks so good!

485
00:11:27,926 --> 00:11:28,891
- [Devon] That's so neat!

486
00:11:28,891 --> 00:11:30,167
- Dude, mine's gonna have

487
00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:31,000
a little toothpick crown,

488
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,208
cause the other thing about a candy burger, man,

489
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,855
you know when you just leave food in the fridge,

490
00:11:33,855 --> 00:11:34,852
and then, your family members eat it,

491
00:11:34,852 --> 00:11:35,970
or someone else eats it?

492
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:36,803
That's not fun.

493
00:11:36,803 --> 00:11:38,413
This is how you protect it.

494
00:11:38,413 --> 00:11:39,528
- [Devon] Yuck.

495
00:11:39,528 --> 00:11:40,361
- [Collins] Thieves are comin' out.

496
00:11:40,361 --> 00:11:41,608
- I'm grabbin' some of this.

497
00:11:41,608 --> 00:11:42,889
- [Collins] Bro, look at that garnish on the top, bro.

498
00:11:42,889 --> 00:11:43,722
Oh!

499
00:11:43,722 --> 00:11:46,361
- This actually works.

500
00:11:46,361 --> 00:11:47,751
You're a little bit too excited about that, bro.

501
00:11:47,751 --> 00:11:48,584
Oh!

502
00:11:48,584 --> 00:11:49,435
Almost forgot one thing!

503
00:11:49,435 --> 00:11:50,268
- What?

504
00:11:50,268 --> 00:11:51,698
- I almost forgot the ketchup.

505
00:11:51,698 --> 00:11:54,511
Alright, I gotta do this right and precise.

506
00:11:54,511 --> 00:11:57,228
- The big reveal, three, two, one.

507
00:11:57,228 --> 00:11:58,344
Boom!

508
00:11:58,344 --> 00:11:59,177
- Whoa!

509
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:00,262
- I cannot wait to eat this,

510
00:12:00,262 --> 00:12:02,174
but we have one final round left,

511
00:12:02,174 --> 00:12:03,641
so right now, comment down below

512
00:12:03,641 --> 00:12:04,474
who you think won.

513
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:05,934
No!

514
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:06,767
- I was about to say,

515
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:09,391
it looks like it's about to fall over any second and it did.

516
00:12:09,391 --> 00:12:11,768
The Rice Krispies treats are back.

517
00:12:11,768 --> 00:12:13,322
- Whoa, guys, this is the final round

518
00:12:13,322 --> 00:12:15,658
before we eat all the different candy foods,

519
00:12:15,658 --> 00:12:17,267
and for this one, we are making

520
00:12:17,267 --> 00:12:18,387
chicken nuggets,

521
00:12:18,387 --> 00:12:19,258
mashed potatoes,

522
00:12:19,258 --> 00:12:20,386
and vegetables.

523
00:12:20,386 --> 00:12:21,757
Pop it open, Devon,

524
00:12:21,757 --> 00:12:24,691
and this was suggested by the Instagram Keyper of the Week.

525
00:12:24,691 --> 00:12:26,336
Shout to you, and if you wanna be shouted out

526
00:12:26,336 --> 00:12:27,257
as the Instagram Keyper of the Week,

527
00:12:27,257 --> 00:12:29,362
check the description down below to find out how.

528
00:12:29,362 --> 00:12:30,354
Are you tearing it open?

529
00:12:30,354 --> 00:12:31,204
- Yup.

530
00:12:31,204 --> 00:12:32,168
- Whoa!

531
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,192
First step first for the chicken nuggets,

532
00:12:33,192 --> 00:12:34,576
gotta take off little pieces here,

533
00:12:34,576 --> 00:12:35,649
and then, we're gonna kind of like

534
00:12:35,649 --> 00:12:36,579
mold em into the chicken nuggets shape.

535
00:12:36,579 --> 00:12:38,377
- Alright, there's my chicken nugget.

536
00:12:38,377 --> 00:12:39,481
Looking good.

537
00:12:39,481 --> 00:12:40,316
- Oh, man, this is so much.

538
00:12:40,316 --> 00:12:41,220
It's so satisfying to just

539
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,649
crunch the Rice Krispies treats, man.

540
00:12:42,649 --> 00:12:43,665
- I know.

541
00:12:43,665 --> 00:12:44,525
It really is nice.

542
00:12:44,525 --> 00:12:47,236
If you get a chance, I'd recommend it.

543
00:12:47,236 --> 00:12:48,439
Gotta squish em more.

544
00:12:48,439 --> 00:12:49,480
That's not nuggety.

545
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:53,477
Now, the largest chicken nugget of all time.

546
00:12:53,477 --> 00:12:54,433
Here, Devon,

547
00:12:54,433 --> 00:12:55,266
you push from that side,

548
00:12:55,266 --> 00:12:56,370
I'll push from this side.

549
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:57,248
- Alright, you ready?

550
00:12:57,248 --> 00:12:58,081
- On the count of three.

551
00:12:58,081 --> 00:12:58,996
- Two, one.

552
00:12:58,996 --> 00:13:00,816
- Next step, we have to add the bread coating

553
00:13:00,816 --> 00:13:01,944
to our chicken nuggets,

554
00:13:01,944 --> 00:13:03,057
and we keep using corn flakes.

555
00:13:03,057 --> 00:13:04,272
- Oh, there he goes.

556
00:13:04,272 --> 00:13:05,355
There you go.

557
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:12,691
- Oh, that's a great idea!

558
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:14,941
- [Devon] No, no, smack it!

559
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,721
Just throw it around!

560
00:13:17,721 --> 00:13:18,554
Yeet!

561
00:13:18,554 --> 00:13:19,387
Ready?

562
00:13:19,387 --> 00:13:20,440
- [Collins] Alright!

563
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,273
- [Devon] Ready?

564
00:13:21,273 --> 00:13:22,190
You get it?

565
00:13:24,218 --> 00:13:25,051
- Yeet!

566
00:13:28,576 --> 00:13:29,480
We're gonna put a hole in the ceiling.

567
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,864
Yeet!

568
00:13:30,864 --> 00:13:31,820
Wait, how'd it come out of the bag?

569
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,878
- [Devon] I don't know.

570
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:33,711
- Alright, there we go.

571
00:13:33,711 --> 00:13:34,937
I think we definitely pulverized this thing to the max.

572
00:13:34,937 --> 00:13:35,771
Here we go.

573
00:13:35,771 --> 00:13:36,802
We're gonna put it in here.

574
00:13:36,802 --> 00:13:37,953
- [Devon] Now, we dump these in there.

575
00:13:37,953 --> 00:13:39,509
Get the powder on em.

576
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:41,147
That actually looks like one.

577
00:13:41,147 --> 00:13:42,405
- [Collins] Dude, it literally

578
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:43,459
is looking like a chicken nugget now.

579
00:13:43,459 --> 00:13:44,553
- [Devon] That looks like a chicken nugget.

580
00:13:44,553 --> 00:13:45,900
- I wonder if there's like legit

581
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:46,833
a process for trying to break,

582
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:47,829
well, I'm sure there is,

583
00:13:47,829 --> 00:13:48,662
for like actually trying to bread chicken nuggets.

584
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:49,933
- I'm sure there is.

585
00:13:49,933 --> 00:13:50,910
- [Collins] Oh, that works!

586
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:51,784
Hey!

587
00:13:51,784 --> 00:13:52,617
There we go!

588
00:13:52,617 --> 00:13:53,450
Breaded.

589
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:54,317
- What happened to this one?

590
00:13:54,317 --> 00:13:55,153
It's so small?

591
00:13:55,153 --> 00:13:55,994
- Hey, never judge a nugget

592
00:13:55,994 --> 00:13:57,860
by the size of its nuggetness.

593
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,990
There we go, boom.

594
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:01,140
- Alright, get out of here.

595
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,021
- Got some Laffy Taffies to represent vegetables,

596
00:14:03,021 --> 00:14:05,220
cause, I mean they're practically the same thing.

597
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,965
- Eat your Laffy Taffies, kids.

598
00:14:06,965 --> 00:14:08,208
That's what they say.

599
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:09,639
- I'm gonna make mine look like green beans,

600
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:11,129
cause personally, I'm not a big fan of green beans,

601
00:14:11,129 --> 00:14:13,571
but I like these green beans.

602
00:14:13,571 --> 00:14:14,611
I've got the longest green beans

603
00:14:14,611 --> 00:14:15,979
in all the green bean land.

604
00:14:15,979 --> 00:14:17,625
- [Devon] Cut it up into slices.

605
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:18,657
- Broccoli's got a whole bunch

606
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:19,759
of little like holes on it.

607
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:20,774
Bam, broccoli!

608
00:14:20,774 --> 00:14:22,013
Don't judge it.

609
00:14:22,013 --> 00:14:22,887
Don't even look at it.

610
00:14:22,887 --> 00:14:23,830
It's just not on the plate.

611
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:24,791
See, I'm not gonna be picky about my colors,

612
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:27,108
because vegetables come in all colors, even pink.

613
00:14:27,108 --> 00:14:28,157
- Which one's that?

614
00:14:28,157 --> 00:14:29,004
- A beet root.

615
00:14:29,004 --> 00:14:29,837
- A what?

616
00:14:29,837 --> 00:14:30,670
- A beet root!

617
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,503
That's a pink vegetable.

618
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:32,336
Alright, fair enough.

619
00:14:32,336 --> 00:14:33,169
- Alright, here we go.

620
00:14:33,169 --> 00:14:34,002
Now, it's time for my ice cream,

621
00:14:34,002 --> 00:14:35,373
which is going to act as the mashed potatoes.

622
00:14:35,373 --> 00:14:36,530
There's so much sugar on one plate.

623
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:38,025
It's awesome.

624
00:14:38,025 --> 00:14:38,880
Dope!

625
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,713
Alright.

626
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:40,546
Ooh!

627
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:41,740
(mumbles)

628
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:44,610
Dude, what if you dipped the nugget in the ice cream?

629
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:46,141
- You should try it!

630
00:14:46,141 --> 00:14:48,363
- [Collins] Ooh, that actually looks pretty darn good.

631
00:14:48,363 --> 00:14:49,362
- [Devon] Alright, gotta get it

632
00:14:49,362 --> 00:14:50,904
to look like mashed potatoes.

633
00:14:50,904 --> 00:14:53,524
- I cannot say how excited I am to eat this right now,

634
00:14:53,524 --> 00:14:54,492
and this is the final round,

635
00:14:54,492 --> 00:14:55,630
so you guys comment down below

636
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:58,095
who won this round, and who won all of the rounds,

637
00:14:58,095 --> 00:14:59,348
and how we're gonna do this,

638
00:14:59,348 --> 00:15:00,419
we're gonna start this taste test

639
00:15:00,419 --> 00:15:01,976
at the beginning, which is the sushi,

640
00:15:01,976 --> 00:15:03,501
and then work our way all the way

641
00:15:03,501 --> 00:15:04,863
to tasting this one right here,

642
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:06,702
so let's eat some candy sushi.

643
00:15:06,702 --> 00:15:07,831
Got some chopsticks right here

644
00:15:07,831 --> 00:15:09,638
to be able to eat my piece of sushi.

645
00:15:09,638 --> 00:15:10,698
- Your piece?

646
00:15:10,698 --> 00:15:12,978
You're gonna grab this whole thing with one chopstick?

647
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:13,998
- [Collins] Yup.

648
00:15:13,998 --> 00:15:15,161
- I really wanna try one of these.

649
00:15:15,161 --> 00:15:16,297
I wanna try one of the rolls.

650
00:15:16,297 --> 00:15:17,348
This looks really good.

651
00:15:17,348 --> 00:15:18,181
Oh!

652
00:15:18,181 --> 00:15:19,014
Look at that, so good!

653
00:15:19,014 --> 00:15:20,417
- You are very skilled with your chopsticks.

654
00:15:20,417 --> 00:15:21,302
- What?

655
00:15:21,302 --> 00:15:22,196
Oh, yes, of course, of course.

656
00:15:22,196 --> 00:15:24,219
- Don't touch my, stop touching my mellows.

657
00:15:24,219 --> 00:15:25,226
- Mellow out, dude.

658
00:15:25,226 --> 00:15:26,893
Alright, here we go.

659
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:34,830
- [Collins] You looked so funny when you ate that.

660
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:35,663
How is it?

661
00:15:38,952 --> 00:15:39,785
He's speechless.

662
00:15:39,785 --> 00:15:41,910
I gotta see what this is like.

663
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:42,743
- Oh, really?

664
00:15:42,743 --> 00:15:44,243
- I couldn't talk.

665
00:15:45,493 --> 00:15:46,328
That was much cleaner.

666
00:15:46,328 --> 00:15:47,994
I really wanna try this, though.

667
00:15:47,994 --> 00:15:48,827
Mm!

668
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:51,999
- That's good?

669
00:15:51,999 --> 00:15:52,870
- Mhm.

670
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:53,703
- What's delicious,

671
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:55,231
it's a fruit rollup around it,

672
00:15:55,231 --> 00:15:57,024
adds a whole nother like flavor,

673
00:15:57,024 --> 00:15:58,045
and the texture, just like the crunchiness,

674
00:15:58,045 --> 00:15:58,878
ooh!

675
00:15:58,878 --> 00:15:59,992
There's only one way to eat this,

676
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:02,516
and that is to abandon tradition of the chopsticks,

677
00:16:02,516 --> 00:16:04,278
and go for the chop hands.

678
00:16:04,278 --> 00:16:05,504
- What's that?

679
00:16:05,504 --> 00:16:06,337
- Just two hands.

680
00:16:06,337 --> 00:16:07,170
This is nuts.

681
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:08,227
- [Devon] It's all falling apart.

682
00:16:08,227 --> 00:16:09,060
- I can tell.

683
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,525
This is quite honestly the most legendary

684
00:16:10,525 --> 00:16:13,523
piece of sushi I've ever seen in my entire life.

685
00:16:13,523 --> 00:16:15,154
- It's like a plate of assorted sushi.

686
00:16:15,154 --> 00:16:16,117
- Yeah, exactly.

687
00:16:16,117 --> 00:16:18,539
Get some Swedish fish and some coconut.

688
00:16:18,539 --> 00:16:19,853
Gonna get all the different salmon eggs

689
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:20,899
on top of this coconut.

690
00:16:20,899 --> 00:16:21,779
- Why?

691
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:22,612
I wanted some of those!

692
00:16:22,612 --> 00:16:23,588
- There we go, like that,

693
00:16:23,588 --> 00:16:25,116
and then, a marshmallow to top it off.

694
00:16:25,116 --> 00:16:29,627
It's just a piece of the masterpiece, literally.

695
00:16:29,627 --> 00:16:30,460
- How is it?

696
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,293
- It's good, but like,

697
00:16:34,857 --> 00:16:35,690
- Oh, really?

698
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:37,678
- Fish eggs at a sushi restaurant are called roe,

699
00:16:37,678 --> 00:16:41,011
so I call this one here the rainbow roe.

700
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:43,783
- That's so cool!

701
00:16:43,783 --> 00:16:44,777
- That was delicious!

702
00:16:44,777 --> 00:16:45,610
Alright!

703
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:46,443
Now, it's time to take the next one,

704
00:16:46,443 --> 00:16:47,518
which is the pasta.

705
00:16:47,518 --> 00:16:48,724
Just from a visual perspective,

706
00:16:48,724 --> 00:16:50,992
I think these pastas turned out the best

707
00:16:50,992 --> 00:16:51,963
out of all of em,

708
00:16:51,963 --> 00:16:53,347
and I'm so excited to see if they taste

709
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:54,477
as good as they look.

710
00:16:54,477 --> 00:16:56,108
I think you just gotta like, stick it in,

711
00:16:56,108 --> 00:16:57,669
try to get some noodles on there.

712
00:16:57,669 --> 00:16:59,148
You almost elbowed me in the face.

713
00:16:59,148 --> 00:16:59,981
- I'm sorry!

714
00:16:59,981 --> 00:17:00,814
- I got noodles,

715
00:17:00,814 --> 00:17:01,647
I got some of the chocolate on top,

716
00:17:01,647 --> 00:17:02,480
and then I got meatball as well.

717
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,313
- Got a meatball.

718
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:04,251
- Alright, three--

719
00:17:04,251 --> 00:17:05,084
- Two.

720
00:17:05,084 --> 00:17:05,917
- I'm gonna get this all over my face.

721
00:17:05,917 --> 00:17:06,750
One.

722
00:17:09,489 --> 00:17:10,322
Mm!

723
00:17:17,006 --> 00:17:19,069
That did not taste at all what I thought

724
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:20,021
it was going to taste like,

725
00:17:20,021 --> 00:17:22,531
because the jelly is like the first taste that hits you,

726
00:17:22,531 --> 00:17:23,728
and it's just like, mm!

727
00:17:23,728 --> 00:17:24,935
It's so good, and then,

728
00:17:24,935 --> 00:17:26,712
like the Twizzlers add this whole like texture

729
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:27,842
to what's going on.

730
00:17:27,842 --> 00:17:29,286
- And the chocolate balls actually have some salt,

731
00:17:29,286 --> 00:17:32,297
so it actually had a little bit of salt in there,

732
00:17:32,297 --> 00:17:33,848
which was really, really good.

733
00:17:33,848 --> 00:17:34,973
- It was creme on the inside,

734
00:17:34,973 --> 00:17:35,909
and you could just taste it,

735
00:17:35,909 --> 00:17:37,494
like the hint of white chocolate on it.

736
00:17:37,494 --> 00:17:39,077
I don't know if it's just me being like hyper

737
00:17:39,077 --> 00:17:40,233
from the sugar or just so excited about this food,

738
00:17:40,233 --> 00:17:41,561
but that was delicious,

739
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,085
and now, we're on to the next one.

740
00:17:43,085 --> 00:17:45,655
It's time to eat some tacos.

741
00:17:45,655 --> 00:17:46,669
Oh, we already ate the tacos.

742
00:17:46,669 --> 00:17:48,255
The next one, we've already eaten the tacos,

743
00:17:48,255 --> 00:17:49,560
so we're skippin' over that one,

744
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,372
and now, it's time to eat the burger.

745
00:17:51,372 --> 00:17:53,225
- [Devon] Bro, what happened to your burger?

746
00:17:53,225 --> 00:17:54,333
- Well, while it was sittin' over there,

747
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,923
it fell over, apparently wasn't structurally sound enough.

748
00:17:56,923 --> 00:17:57,798
I'm just gonna pick it up,

749
00:17:57,798 --> 00:17:59,016
get it back on its buns again.

750
00:17:59,016 --> 00:17:59,877
- Yup.

751
00:17:59,877 --> 00:18:00,710
- Alright.

752
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:01,608
So, let's do this.

753
00:18:01,608 --> 00:18:02,441
We're first gonna eat the french fries.

754
00:18:02,441 --> 00:18:03,824
- Oh, okay.

755
00:18:03,824 --> 00:18:04,687
- And see how these taste.

756
00:18:04,687 --> 00:18:07,424
Let's see if they're crunchy and delicious.

757
00:18:07,424 --> 00:18:08,897
- Mm, they're soft and cloudy.

758
00:18:08,897 --> 00:18:09,981
- It tastes like what it was,

759
00:18:09,981 --> 00:18:11,024
which was a loaf,

760
00:18:11,024 --> 00:18:12,385
but it tastes delicious, though.

761
00:18:12,385 --> 00:18:13,862
The most sugary French fry ever.

762
00:18:13,862 --> 00:18:15,759
And now, it's time to try to eat the burger.

763
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:16,981
There's no way I can fit this in my mouth.

764
00:18:16,981 --> 00:18:18,399
I don't know how I'm gonna get this.

765
00:18:18,399 --> 00:18:19,809
- I know, that's the disappointment of your burger.

766
00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:20,862
- Oh, I know how it works.

767
00:18:20,862 --> 00:18:22,406
You can press it, cause they're all like parts.

768
00:18:22,406 --> 00:18:23,423
- [Devon] But the brownie doesn't compress.

769
00:18:23,423 --> 00:18:24,703
- Yeah, the brownie's pretty tough.

770
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:25,559
Let's give it a shot, you ready?

771
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:26,420
- Alright, I'm ready!

772
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,920
- Three, two, one.

773
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:30,563
Mhm!

774
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:37,611
- It's stuck to my teeth!

775
00:18:37,611 --> 00:18:38,447
- Whoa!

776
00:18:38,447 --> 00:18:39,280
This one did not work,

777
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,219
because the Airhead,

778
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:41,826
they didn't allow you to bite or chew at all,

779
00:18:41,826 --> 00:18:43,797
so you had this super chewy cupcakes

780
00:18:43,797 --> 00:18:44,661
and all the other stuff,

781
00:18:44,661 --> 00:18:46,095
and then, you couldn't bite through the Laffy Taffy.

782
00:18:46,095 --> 00:18:47,229
- They look so good, though!

783
00:18:47,229 --> 00:18:48,812
- It didn't really taste that good.

784
00:18:48,812 --> 00:18:51,345
- Yeah, it was also the bread mixed with the taffy, too.

785
00:18:51,345 --> 00:18:52,266
Ugh!

786
00:18:52,266 --> 00:18:53,099
- Yeah, it was ugh.

787
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:53,932
It was not so good.

788
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:54,765
So, hopefully,

789
00:18:54,765 --> 00:18:55,598
the final one, which is the chicken nuggets,

790
00:18:55,598 --> 00:18:56,457
is gonna be a lot better,

791
00:18:56,457 --> 00:18:57,353
but this one, man,

792
00:18:57,353 --> 00:18:58,260
I'm a little bit disappointed.

793
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,194
Like, it's still sugar,

794
00:18:59,194 --> 00:19:00,626
so it still tastes good, but like--

795
00:19:00,626 --> 00:19:01,554
- It looks good, so--

796
00:19:01,554 --> 00:19:03,308
- Definitely the weakest combination of em all.

797
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,173
- Yup.

798
00:19:04,173 --> 00:19:05,784
- This is it, the final candy food.

799
00:19:05,784 --> 00:19:08,584
We got chicken nuggets, mashed potatoes, and vegetables,

800
00:19:08,584 --> 00:19:09,417
kind of,

801
00:19:09,417 --> 00:19:10,469
and we want you guys to comment

802
00:19:10,469 --> 00:19:12,130
what is your favorite food that we should

803
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:13,797
turn into a candy version next.

804
00:19:13,797 --> 00:19:15,666
So, comment that down below right now,

805
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,351
and I am so excited to eat this,

806
00:19:17,351 --> 00:19:18,425
so I'm gonna pick up a chicken nugget.

807
00:19:18,425 --> 00:19:20,011
I'm just gonna dip it in the mashed potatoes.

808
00:19:20,011 --> 00:19:21,181
- Mashed potatoes.

809
00:19:21,181 --> 00:19:22,580
- And we're gonna put a little bit of vegetables on it.

810
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,450
- [Devon] Oh, that's a good idea.

811
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:24,448
- [Collins] Ooh.

812
00:19:24,448 --> 00:19:25,541
The ultimate trifecta right here.

813
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:26,428
- Looking good.

814
00:19:26,428 --> 00:19:27,338
- You ready?

815
00:19:27,338 --> 00:19:28,171
- Yeah, I'm ready.

816
00:19:28,171 --> 00:19:29,671
- Three, two, one.

817
00:19:32,363 --> 00:19:33,196
Ow.

818
00:19:33,196 --> 00:19:34,029
- Mmm!

819
00:19:34,029 --> 00:19:34,862
- Ow!

820
00:19:34,862 --> 00:19:35,695
Ow!

821
00:19:35,695 --> 00:19:36,551
It's hard.

822
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:37,665
- This is so good!

823
00:19:37,665 --> 00:19:38,755
- Ow, ow, ow.

824
00:19:38,755 --> 00:19:40,383
Corn flakes makes it so sharp they were hurtin' me,

825
00:19:40,383 --> 00:19:41,336
like I was biting into it.

826
00:19:41,336 --> 00:19:42,285
They were not broken up,

827
00:19:42,285 --> 00:19:43,593
but guys, if you wanna see another video,

828
00:19:43,593 --> 00:19:44,640

829
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,771
and we dare ya right now.

830
00:19:45,771 --> 00:19:47,796
Click right over here, five seconds.

831
00:19:47,796 --> 00:19:48,629
Here we go.

832
00:19:48,629 --> 00:19:51,646
Five, four, three, two, one, done.

833
00:19:51,646 --> 00:19:54,485
That last one was absolutely delicious

834
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:56,096
once I got over the fact that the corn flakes

835
00:19:56,096 --> 00:19:57,419
were bitin' into my mouth.

836
00:19:57,419 --> 00:19:58,444
- I didn't have that problem.

837
00:19:58,444 --> 00:19:59,277
- But yeah, love you guys.

838
00:19:59,277 --> 00:20:00,468
We'll see you guys again soon, bye!
