1
00:00:00,176 --> 00:00:01,861
- [Collin] It's a slime fidget spinner.

2
00:00:01,861 --> 00:00:03,428
- [Both] Three, two, one.

3
00:00:03,428 --> 00:00:06,061
- You challenged me to make a fidget spinner out of slime

4
00:00:06,061 --> 00:00:06,894
and so, to do this,

5
00:00:06,894 --> 00:00:08,128
I've got my little brother, Devan, over here.

6
00:00:08,128 --> 00:00:08,961
- Ay!

7
00:00:08,961 --> 00:00:10,404
- We are going to be making three different types.

8
00:00:10,404 --> 00:00:11,971
One's going to be a normal-sized fidget spinner,

9
00:00:11,971 --> 00:00:13,288
the next one's gonna be a medium one,

10
00:00:13,288 --> 00:00:14,383
and the last one is going to be

11
00:00:14,383 --> 00:00:16,638
the world's largest slime fidget spinner.

12
00:00:16,638 --> 00:00:17,471
So, right now,

13
00:00:17,471 --> 00:00:18,483
let's make some slime.

14
00:00:18,483 --> 00:00:19,316
Pew!

15
00:00:20,223 --> 00:00:21,132
To make the slime,

16
00:00:21,132 --> 00:00:23,042
we're actually using glitter glue right now

17
00:00:23,042 --> 00:00:24,418
because we ain't using that basic glue.

18
00:00:24,418 --> 00:00:25,251
- Uh uh.

19
00:00:25,251 --> 00:00:26,851
(sloshing noises)

20
00:00:26,851 --> 00:00:28,159
- [Both] That should be good.

21
00:00:28,159 --> 00:00:29,079
- How much? - Done!

22
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:31,580
And now, it's time to get our hands dirty.

23
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:32,980
Let's go.

24
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:33,945
That was a solid grab.

25
00:00:33,945 --> 00:00:35,394
Okay, it's starting to look funky.

26
00:00:35,394 --> 00:00:36,429
Devan, we need-

27
00:00:36,429 --> 00:00:37,262
There's too many hands.

28
00:00:37,262 --> 00:00:38,639
There's too much hands and not enough slime

29
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:39,595
- That's so weird!

30
00:00:39,595 --> 00:00:40,933
- I think we should use a little more Sta-Flo

31
00:00:40,933 --> 00:00:41,819
'cuz it's still a little bit glue-y.

32
00:00:41,819 --> 00:00:42,652
- I'm down.

33
00:00:42,652 --> 00:00:43,485
Nice.

34
00:00:43,485 --> 00:00:44,318
There we go.

35
00:00:44,318 --> 00:00:45,151
That's a ton of Sta-Flo - That might have

36
00:00:45,151 --> 00:00:45,984
been too much.

37
00:00:45,984 --> 00:00:46,817
Ooh.

38
00:00:46,817 --> 00:00:48,157
- I'm using the washing-my-hands technique.

39
00:00:48,157 --> 00:00:49,019
- It's working!

40
00:00:49,019 --> 00:00:50,133
- Yo! Yours is actually--

41
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:50,966
Whoa!

42
00:00:52,033 --> 00:00:53,016
(screaming)

43
00:00:53,016 --> 00:00:54,213
- No!

44
00:00:54,213 --> 00:00:55,083
- Poor little fellow.

45
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:55,916
- I'm out of breath.

46
00:00:55,916 --> 00:00:56,809
That was a lot of nose.

47
00:00:56,809 --> 00:00:58,258
(clapping)

48
00:00:58,258 --> 00:00:59,350
- [Devan] This is actually

49
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,548
turning into some good slime.

50
00:01:00,548 --> 00:01:01,551
Look at this.

51
00:01:01,551 --> 00:01:02,588
- [Collin] It gets so stringy.

52
00:01:02,588 --> 00:01:04,305
- Whoa! - It's like a spiderweb.

53
00:01:04,305 --> 00:01:05,397
- [Devan] It's like a little spiderweb.

54
00:01:05,397 --> 00:01:06,655
- [Collin] Yo! I'm Spiderman.

55
00:01:06,655 --> 00:01:07,488
- Ready?

56
00:01:07,488 --> 00:01:08,446
- Yes. - Ow!

57
00:01:08,446 --> 00:01:09,578
- I'm having a great time.

58
00:01:09,578 --> 00:01:10,411
- Dude!

59
00:01:10,411 --> 00:01:11,576
This was such a good idea!

60
00:01:11,576 --> 00:01:12,694
This is actually working.

61
00:01:12,694 --> 00:01:13,527
Yes!

62
00:01:13,527 --> 00:01:15,125
We've got slime!

63
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:17,799
Let's do a fidget spinner versus slime.

64
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:18,923
Okay. Go for it.

65
00:01:18,923 --> 00:01:19,816
(grunting)

66
00:01:19,816 --> 00:01:21,108
Do it again. That was close.

67
00:01:21,108 --> 00:01:22,556
(grunting and children cheering)

68
00:01:22,556 --> 00:01:23,389
And shout out to the Instagram

69
00:01:23,389 --> 00:01:24,222
Keyper of the Week

70
00:01:24,222 --> 00:01:25,979
for suggesting we make blue glitter slime.

71
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:27,025
If you want to be shouted out

72
00:01:27,025 --> 00:01:28,194
as the Instagram Keyper of the Week,

73
00:01:28,194 --> 00:01:29,370
check the description down below

74
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:30,418
to find out how.

75
00:01:30,418 --> 00:01:31,251
Oh. Ow.

76
00:01:32,109 --> 00:01:32,942
(chime)

77
00:01:32,942 --> 00:01:34,064
And now, we're gonna remove a piece of this.

78
00:01:34,064 --> 00:01:35,163
So, I think the process we use

79
00:01:35,163 --> 00:01:37,701
is the wibble wobble technique.

80
00:01:37,701 --> 00:01:38,534
Wibble wobble.

81
00:01:38,534 --> 00:01:39,442
So, here's how we're gonna do this.

82
00:01:39,442 --> 00:01:40,275
Let me see.

83
00:01:40,275 --> 00:01:41,130
I think we're just gonna pop this in here.

84
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:42,284
We're gonna push it down like this

85
00:01:42,284 --> 00:01:43,506
and then I think that we will--

86
00:01:43,506 --> 00:01:45,075
we'll try to mold it into place, all right?

87
00:01:45,075 --> 00:01:46,296
So, here we go. - Can we get an extra piece

88
00:01:46,296 --> 00:01:47,129
'coz I-- - Nope.

89
00:01:47,129 --> 00:01:48,038
(jibberish)

90
00:01:48,038 --> 00:01:49,405
your extra piece away, Devan.

91
00:01:49,405 --> 00:01:52,155
It'll mess up my whole vibe, bro.

92
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:54,480
(sneezing)

93
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,313
- Ew!

94
00:01:55,313 --> 00:01:56,225
- All right, now we have to make

95
00:01:56,225 --> 00:01:57,308
the center part of it.

96
00:01:57,308 --> 00:01:58,374
So, let's turn that--

97
00:01:58,374 --> 00:01:59,436
That actually worked out well.

98
00:01:59,436 --> 00:02:00,343
- [Devan] That's looking pretty nice.

99
00:02:00,343 --> 00:02:02,426
- Whoa! What a technique.

100
00:02:03,627 --> 00:02:05,028
Now, because we wanna make sure

101
00:02:05,028 --> 00:02:06,172
this can actually spin,

102
00:02:06,172 --> 00:02:07,711
we're gonna have to do one extra step

103
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:08,544
'cuz look at this.

104
00:02:08,544 --> 00:02:09,490
If you took this as a fidget spinner

105
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:11,118
and tried to make it spin. - Bro!

106
00:02:11,118 --> 00:02:12,050
- It just stretches out.

107
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:12,883
It breaks.

108
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:13,716
It will not work.

109
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:15,026
So, we're gonna pop it in the freezer for a little bit.

110
00:02:15,026 --> 00:02:15,859
What the heck? - What?

111
00:02:15,859 --> 00:02:17,412
- And then we're gonna see

112
00:02:17,412 --> 00:02:18,996
if we can actually make it spin.

113
00:02:18,996 --> 00:02:20,185
- [SpongeBob] Eventually.

114
00:02:20,185 --> 00:02:21,018
All right, you ready?

115
00:02:21,018 --> 00:02:21,851
- [Devan] I am ready.

116
00:02:21,851 --> 00:02:23,325
- Yay! (shouting)

117
00:02:23,325 --> 00:02:24,158
Uh oh.

118
00:02:24,158 --> 00:02:24,991
No. Don't.

119
00:02:24,991 --> 00:02:25,858
Not my hair!

120
00:02:25,858 --> 00:02:28,191
(screaming)

121
00:02:29,285 --> 00:02:30,616
Yo! This looks like something

122
00:02:30,616 --> 00:02:31,714
out of the Frozen movie.

123
00:02:31,714 --> 00:02:33,036
- [Devan] That looks so cool.

124
00:02:33,036 --> 00:02:34,576
- Let's see if we can get it out.

125
00:02:34,576 --> 00:02:36,789
Whoa, dude. It's kinda getting fluffy

126
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:37,861
and back to slime mode.

127
00:02:37,861 --> 00:02:40,126
(excited shouting)

128
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:40,959
Look at this.

129
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,121
- [Devan] That turned out so well.

130
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:42,954
- If you guys can see,

131
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,320
look at the sides here.

132
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,448
It's all slimy.

133
00:02:45,448 --> 00:02:46,936
This actually turned out so good

134
00:02:46,936 --> 00:02:48,097
and so, now-- - That's so cool.

135
00:02:48,097 --> 00:02:49,022
- Devan take apart the fidget spinner.

136
00:02:49,022 --> 00:02:50,069
Pop it out really quick.

137
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:51,547
(grunting)

138
00:02:51,547 --> 00:02:52,524
(glass shattering)

139
00:02:52,524 --> 00:02:54,414
You shot it across the table, dude.

140
00:02:54,414 --> 00:02:55,691
- And we finally retrieved it.

141
00:02:55,691 --> 00:02:56,524
Here you go.

142
00:02:56,524 --> 00:02:57,357
- Thank you.

143
00:02:57,357 --> 00:02:58,445
- [Devan] Time to see if this will work.

144
00:02:58,445 --> 00:02:59,278
- [Collin] All right, I'm gonna be very careful.

145
00:02:59,278 --> 00:03:01,148
Okay, it goes in. - Ooh, that's a snug fit.

146
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:01,981
- It's time to find out,

147
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:04,481
can the slime fidget spinner actually spin?

148
00:03:04,481 --> 00:03:05,911
But first, we've got a challenge.

149
00:03:05,911 --> 00:03:06,744
We want to see,

150
00:03:06,744 --> 00:03:07,942
can you subscribe to this channel,

151
00:03:07,942 --> 00:03:09,799
turn on the channel post notifications,

152
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:11,565
and give this video a thumbs up

153
00:03:11,565 --> 00:03:12,686
in seven seconds.

154
00:03:12,686 --> 00:03:13,519
Here we go. Let's try it.

155
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:14,352
- [Both] Seven,

156
00:03:14,352 --> 00:03:15,185
six

157
00:03:15,185 --> 00:03:16,018
Five,

158
00:03:16,018 --> 00:03:16,851
four,

159
00:03:16,851 --> 00:03:17,684
three,

160
00:03:17,684 --> 00:03:18,517
two,

161
00:03:18,517 --> 00:03:19,557
one, done!

162
00:03:19,557 --> 00:03:20,430
If you could do that,

163
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,263
comment down below,

164
00:03:21,263 --> 00:03:22,373
Keyper Squad, right now.

165
00:03:22,373 --> 00:03:24,038
It's a slime fidget spinner!

166
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:24,918
Will it spin?

167
00:03:24,918 --> 00:03:26,581
- [Both] Three, two, one.

168
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,708
(excited shouting)

169
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,298
- Yo! The fidget spinner works.

170
00:03:31,298 --> 00:03:33,038
(excited shouting)

171
00:03:33,038 --> 00:03:34,018
Let's see if we can get it again.

172
00:03:34,018 --> 00:03:35,423
Three, two, one.

173
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:36,337
- [Devan] No.

174
00:03:36,337 --> 00:03:37,170
- [Collin] It broke.

175
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:38,003
- No!

176
00:03:38,003 --> 00:03:38,854
- Now, it's time to find out

177
00:03:38,854 --> 00:03:40,737
if the medium-sized one is gonna work

178
00:03:40,737 --> 00:03:41,600
and then we're gonna see

179
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,326
if the largest one in the entire world can spin,

180
00:03:44,326 --> 00:03:46,036
but so far it's working.

181
00:03:46,036 --> 00:03:47,021
All right, so to start this off

182
00:03:47,021 --> 00:03:48,500
I'm just gonna have you put this on your head.

183
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,333
- What? Why?

184
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:50,166
- 'Cuz I think it'll be funny.

185
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:50,999
- No.

186
00:03:50,999 --> 00:03:51,832
That doesn't make any sense.

187
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:52,665
- For this one,

188
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:53,706
a ton of you wanted us to make fluffy slime.

189
00:03:53,706 --> 00:03:56,275
Why do you have a bucket on your head, dude?

190
00:03:56,275 --> 00:03:57,664
We need just some glue for this.

191
00:03:57,664 --> 00:03:59,255
We have some shaving cream

192
00:03:59,255 --> 00:04:00,525
and some Sta-Flo.

193
00:04:00,525 --> 00:04:01,358
- Yeah!

194
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:03,124
- Sta-Flo!

195
00:04:03,124 --> 00:04:05,922
- [Both] Three, two, one.

196
00:04:05,922 --> 00:04:06,828
- [Collin] Why are you going so fast?

197
00:04:06,828 --> 00:04:07,963
- 'Cuz this is a competition, bro.

198
00:04:07,963 --> 00:04:08,796
- Wait! What?

199
00:04:08,796 --> 00:04:09,629
- Yeah.

200
00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:10,462
First one to fill it up wins. - What?

201
00:04:10,462 --> 00:04:11,701
Why are we making a competition out of this?

202
00:04:11,701 --> 00:04:12,590
There's no reason.

203
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,506
- 'Cuz why not?

204
00:04:13,506 --> 00:04:15,064
I'm already on my third. - Okay, I'm definitely

205
00:04:15,064 --> 00:04:16,457
not going to win this. - I mean my fourth.

206
00:04:16,457 --> 00:04:17,459
Nyay!

207
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:18,292
- [Collin] Dude!

208
00:04:18,292 --> 00:04:19,658
- I've done five. - That's not five.

209
00:04:19,658 --> 00:04:20,591
- Yeah, that's five, man.

210
00:04:20,591 --> 00:04:22,043
One, two, three, four, five.

211
00:04:22,043 --> 00:04:22,876
- [Collin] Listen.

212
00:04:22,876 --> 00:04:24,234
(splashing)

213
00:04:24,234 --> 00:04:25,067
- How many are left?

214
00:04:25,067 --> 00:04:25,900
- I don't know.

215
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:26,745
I think this is it. - How many have you done?

216
00:04:26,745 --> 00:04:27,732
- I've done whatever has been over here.

217
00:04:27,732 --> 00:04:28,565
- Well, that one's yours.

218
00:04:28,565 --> 00:04:29,868
I won.

219
00:04:29,868 --> 00:04:30,785
Ooh!

220
00:04:30,785 --> 00:04:31,770
My favorite part.

221
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:32,665
The shaving cream.

222
00:04:32,665 --> 00:04:33,998
- Let's get lit.

223
00:04:34,923 --> 00:04:37,027
- That was-- - In the glue?

224
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:37,860
- All right, I'm ready to go.

225
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,076
- You ready? All right. Here we go.

226
00:04:39,076 --> 00:04:39,917
- [Both] Three, two, one.

227
00:04:39,917 --> 00:04:40,750
Dispense!

228
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,798
(grunting)

229
00:04:41,798 --> 00:04:43,049
- I forgot how much shaving cream is needed

230
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,430
to make fluffy slime. - I love this.

231
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:47,578
- I'm gonna try to make a giant tower with it.

232
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:48,497
And okay, it's done.

233
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:49,570
Done! Done! Done!

234
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:50,512
I know I should stop,

235
00:04:50,512 --> 00:04:51,345
but I can't.

236
00:04:51,345 --> 00:04:53,011
I can't stop - Why are you not stopping?

237
00:04:53,011 --> 00:04:54,664
- My finger's stuck. - How is your finger stuck?

238
00:04:54,664 --> 00:04:55,497
- Three, two, one.

239
00:04:55,497 --> 00:04:56,330
Go in.

240
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,676
- [Devan] Ah! That feels so good!

241
00:04:57,676 --> 00:04:59,175
- [Collin] Shaving cream is one of the craziest feelings

242
00:04:59,175 --> 00:05:00,599
mixed with the glue.

243
00:05:00,599 --> 00:05:01,680
- It's like clouds.

244
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,513
- We were so hyped

245
00:05:02,513 --> 00:05:03,944
and this stuff just calmed us right down.

246
00:05:03,944 --> 00:05:05,096
- It's all you need in life.

247
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,614
- I think we added way too much shaving cream.

248
00:05:06,614 --> 00:05:08,029
Way too much shaving cream. - I don't think so.

249
00:05:08,029 --> 00:05:08,862
This is way worth it.

250
00:05:08,862 --> 00:05:09,983
All right, you have to scoop it

251
00:05:09,983 --> 00:05:10,954
at the bottom to get some of this glue mixed in.

252
00:05:10,954 --> 00:05:11,787
I know.

253
00:05:11,787 --> 00:05:13,603
All right, we gotta mix it in.

254
00:05:13,603 --> 00:05:14,991
Look how fluffy my hand looks.

255
00:05:14,991 --> 00:05:16,354
I wish I could eat my hand.

256
00:05:16,354 --> 00:05:17,894
All right, so now we got some Sta-Flo.

257
00:05:17,894 --> 00:05:18,727
We're gonna add some of this in.

258
00:05:18,727 --> 00:05:20,067
Yeah, we might wanna get a bigger bucket.

259
00:05:20,067 --> 00:05:20,900
- Whoop.

260
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,802
- So this stuff is not--

261
00:05:21,802 --> 00:05:23,943
The bucket is just floating.

262
00:05:23,943 --> 00:05:24,776
Oh, no!

263
00:05:24,776 --> 00:05:26,018
For just a medium-sized fidget spinner,

264
00:05:26,018 --> 00:05:26,918
we made way too much slime,

265
00:05:26,918 --> 00:05:28,863
but a ton of you guys wanted us to make it green.

266
00:05:28,863 --> 00:05:30,712
We're gonna add some food coloring in right now.

267
00:05:30,712 --> 00:05:32,879
I'm gonna be very careful.

268
00:05:34,873 --> 00:05:36,764
- Bro! I'm making a basketball.

269
00:05:36,764 --> 00:05:38,067
- Here we go. We're gonna add some drops in.

270
00:05:38,067 --> 00:05:41,317
(light, playful music)

271
00:05:48,118 --> 00:05:49,409
I wanna hear what it sounds like.

272
00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:51,286
(loud smacking)

273
00:05:51,286 --> 00:05:52,827
Look at this.

274
00:05:52,827 --> 00:05:54,327
- Three, two, one.

275
00:05:56,434 --> 00:05:57,895
(excited shouting)

276
00:05:57,895 --> 00:05:58,728
- [Collin] It was so close!

277
00:05:58,728 --> 00:05:59,831
- [Devan] Dude, that was so close.

278
00:05:59,831 --> 00:06:00,664
- And now it's time to make

279
00:06:00,664 --> 00:06:01,997
the medium mold.

280
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:04,996
Woo!

281
00:06:04,996 --> 00:06:05,829
- I have a winter glove.

282
00:06:05,829 --> 00:06:06,785
- I gotta say, I'm actually pretty proud

283
00:06:06,785 --> 00:06:08,558
of what we're doing before the mold

284
00:06:08,558 --> 00:06:11,481
because I've combined in the gummy fidget spinner idea,

285
00:06:11,481 --> 00:06:13,521
but this time we've made a gummy fidget spinner,

286
00:06:13,521 --> 00:06:14,624
cut out the center,

287
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,437
and we're gonna fill it - Whoa!

288
00:06:16,437 --> 00:06:17,466
- With the slime.

289
00:06:17,466 --> 00:06:19,350
(wiggly sound effects)

290
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,564
I'm gonna tear off a little bit right now.

291
00:06:20,564 --> 00:06:21,397
- Can I have some?

292
00:06:21,397 --> 00:06:22,610
- Here we go.

293
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:23,443
Yep.

294
00:06:25,001 --> 00:06:26,119
We're gonna put a little bit in here.

295
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,442
I'm gonna fill out the sides a little bit.

296
00:06:27,442 --> 00:06:28,275
Here we go.

297
00:06:28,275 --> 00:06:30,008
- Is it going well? - Yes, Devan.

298
00:06:30,008 --> 00:06:30,921
I appreciate the help.

299
00:06:30,921 --> 00:06:31,754
All right, guys. There we go.

300
00:06:31,754 --> 00:06:32,912
We now have the slime.

301
00:06:32,912 --> 00:06:35,841
We're gonna put a little hole in it.

302
00:06:35,841 --> 00:06:36,814
It just filled right back up.

303
00:06:36,814 --> 00:06:37,800
All right, let's pop it in the freezer.

304
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,633
- [SpongeBob] Later.

305
00:06:38,633 --> 00:06:39,533
- [Both] Whoa!

306
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:40,669
- [Collin] Dude, this turned out awesome.

307
00:06:40,669 --> 00:06:41,502
- [Devan] That turned out awesome.

308
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:43,321
- I'm gonna try to pop it out right now.

309
00:06:43,321 --> 00:06:44,154
- [Devan] Don't lose it.

310
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,295
(excited gasps)

311
00:06:45,295 --> 00:06:46,327
- [Collin] We're gonna try to DIY

312
00:06:46,327 --> 00:06:47,293
the bearing on this thing.

313
00:06:47,293 --> 00:06:48,773
- [Devan] Put it on here, like this.

314
00:06:48,773 --> 00:06:49,606
- Okay.

315
00:06:49,606 --> 00:06:50,439
So, take it out. - Flip it over.

316
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:51,272
- Yeah, flip it over.

317
00:06:51,272 --> 00:06:52,105
No! Stop!

318
00:06:52,105 --> 00:06:53,181
You have to go all at the same time.

319
00:06:53,181 --> 00:06:54,242
So stressful!

320
00:06:54,242 --> 00:06:55,804
- Whoa! - Set that down. Okay.

321
00:06:55,804 --> 00:06:56,637
- [Devan] Oh, no.

322
00:06:56,637 --> 00:06:57,470
One side just cracked.

323
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:58,880
It's not gonna spin around on it, is it?

324
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,138
- Let's get a bearing.

325
00:07:00,138 --> 00:07:00,985
Grab another bearing.

326
00:07:00,985 --> 00:07:01,980
We were so focused on how

327
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:02,872
to actually make the fidget spinner

328
00:07:02,872 --> 00:07:04,005
that we didn't think about how to make it spin.

329
00:07:04,005 --> 00:07:05,229
- Wait! A bearing on a bearing?

330
00:07:05,229 --> 00:07:06,578
That was your brilliant idea? - Yes.

331
00:07:06,578 --> 00:07:07,464
Watch.

332
00:07:07,464 --> 00:07:09,547
- [Both] Three, two, one.

333
00:07:10,595 --> 00:07:12,223
(excited shouting)

334
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,511
- That was a great idea!

335
00:07:13,511 --> 00:07:14,344
- We can try it again.

336
00:07:14,344 --> 00:07:15,813
- [Both] Three, two, one.

337
00:07:15,813 --> 00:07:17,274
(excited shouting)

338
00:07:17,274 --> 00:07:18,532
- Dude! It worked.

339
00:07:18,532 --> 00:07:19,693
We made the regular one work.

340
00:07:19,693 --> 00:07:21,137
We made the medium one work.

341
00:07:21,137 --> 00:07:22,058
And now, it's time to make

342
00:07:22,058 --> 00:07:25,396
the world's biggest slime fidget spinner actually spin.

343
00:07:25,396 --> 00:07:26,531
Let's go.

344
00:07:26,531 --> 00:07:27,657
You know what time it is.

345
00:07:27,657 --> 00:07:28,619
- It's glue time. - Time to make--

346
00:07:28,619 --> 00:07:29,925
No, time to make a big one.

347
00:07:29,925 --> 00:07:30,758
- Oh.

348
00:07:30,758 --> 00:07:31,598
(laughing)

349
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:32,575
- So, we've been instructed

350
00:07:32,575 --> 00:07:33,763
to only use half of this otherwise--

351
00:07:33,763 --> 00:07:34,626
I think I'm half.

352
00:07:34,626 --> 00:07:35,459
Oops.

353
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:37,013
- You never finished your sentence

354
00:07:37,013 --> 00:07:38,393
when you said we're gonna put it over here.

355
00:07:38,393 --> 00:07:39,459
You cut it off.

356
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,292
- Okay.

357
00:07:40,292 --> 00:07:42,008
- You gotta finish stuff.

358
00:07:42,008 --> 00:07:42,841
- All right.

359
00:07:42,841 --> 00:07:44,057
- Yep.

360
00:07:44,057 --> 00:07:45,751
- We're using three different colors for the slime.

361
00:07:45,751 --> 00:07:46,584
We've got red.

362
00:07:46,584 --> 00:07:47,417
- Blue.

363
00:07:47,417 --> 00:07:48,250
- [Both] And yellow.

364
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,499
- And we're making the yellow one off-camera

365
00:07:49,499 --> 00:07:50,584
because it's the exact same process.

366
00:07:50,584 --> 00:07:51,417
So, we're like.

367
00:07:51,417 --> 00:07:52,250
Yay!

368
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:56,167
(light, Hawaiian island music)

369
00:08:05,357 --> 00:08:06,190
Cheers.

370
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,023
Here we go.

371
00:08:07,023 --> 00:08:08,298
Sta-Flo time.

372
00:08:08,298 --> 00:08:09,468
That's enough.

373
00:08:09,468 --> 00:08:10,301
- All right.

374
00:08:10,301 --> 00:08:11,557
You wanna add a little bit at a time.

375
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:13,198
- I did way more than a little bit.

376
00:08:13,198 --> 00:08:14,032
You used the wrong hand.

377
00:08:14,032 --> 00:08:15,036
You're gonna elbow me in the face, Devan.

378
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:15,869
- I'm sorry.

379
00:08:15,869 --> 00:08:16,702
- All good.

380
00:08:16,702 --> 00:08:17,535
Until I get elbowed in the face.

381
00:08:17,535 --> 00:08:18,444
- [Devan] I think my hand's gonna be

382
00:08:18,444 --> 00:08:19,304
blue after this, though.

383
00:08:19,304 --> 00:08:20,219
- Yeah, my hand's definitely gonna be red.

384
00:08:20,219 --> 00:08:21,052
And look.

385
00:08:21,052 --> 00:08:22,109
It's given me a weird outline on it too.

386
00:08:22,109 --> 00:08:24,046
So, it's gonna look like a got a rash.

387
00:08:24,046 --> 00:08:24,879
- Ew.

388
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,129
(light, playful music)

389
00:08:37,561 --> 00:08:38,394
- Now, just like before,

390
00:08:38,394 --> 00:08:39,944
we're using a giant gummy mold

391
00:08:39,944 --> 00:08:41,265
to make the fidget spinner.

392
00:08:41,265 --> 00:08:42,098
So, right now,

393
00:08:42,098 --> 00:08:45,519
I'm gonna put some of the pink one in here.

394
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:46,352
And then, again,

395
00:08:46,352 --> 00:08:47,185
we're gonna pop 'em in the freezer.

396
00:08:47,185 --> 00:08:48,334
It just does not stay in here.

397
00:08:48,334 --> 00:08:49,804
This is--

398
00:08:49,804 --> 00:08:51,400
We're gonna have to figure this out.

399
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,650
(light, playful music)

400
00:08:56,268 --> 00:08:58,588
This turned out so good. - The colors are so cool.

401
00:08:58,588 --> 00:09:00,450
- So, we made all of the individual pieces

402
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,915
and right now we're about to assemble them,

403
00:09:01,915 --> 00:09:03,158
put them together and turn them

404
00:09:03,158 --> 00:09:06,026
into the world's largest slime fidget spinner.

405
00:09:06,026 --> 00:09:06,859
So, right now--

406
00:09:06,859 --> 00:09:07,732
- Let's go outside.

407
00:09:07,732 --> 00:09:08,565
- Yeah.

408
00:09:09,532 --> 00:09:10,650
(laughing)

409
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:11,483
Sorry.

410
00:09:11,483 --> 00:09:12,316
Was that on camera?

411
00:09:12,316 --> 00:09:13,344
Hey.

412
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:14,971
(groaning)

413
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:15,804
- It doesn't look that bad,

414
00:09:15,804 --> 00:09:16,793
but still-- - He literally

415
00:09:16,793 --> 00:09:17,626
sliced his finger.

416
00:09:17,626 --> 00:09:18,459
He's gonna start bleeding in a second,

417
00:09:18,459 --> 00:09:19,292
but hey, we're outside right now

418
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:20,171
because we've gotta take the spinner,

419
00:09:20,171 --> 00:09:23,280
then we got all these molds of things,

420
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,113
so we can pop 'em in here,

421
00:09:24,113 --> 00:09:24,986
then make it spin.

422
00:09:24,986 --> 00:09:26,844
- Yeah, let's do it.

423
00:09:26,844 --> 00:09:27,677
- [Collin] This is gonna be

424
00:09:27,677 --> 00:09:29,854
a little janky to get it going.

425
00:09:29,854 --> 00:09:30,845
- Just a little bit.

426
00:09:30,845 --> 00:09:31,710
Not a lot.

427
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,726
- [Collin] We couldn't find a bearing that was big enough

428
00:09:33,726 --> 00:09:35,407
to fit in the middle of it,

429
00:09:35,407 --> 00:09:38,344
so we're resorting to our improv here.

430
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:39,769
It's starting to melt because it was in the freezer.

431
00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:40,602
So, we've gotta pop that--

432
00:09:40,602 --> 00:09:41,435
- [Devan] Do you know where it's supposed to go?

433
00:09:41,435 --> 00:09:42,526
- [Collin] Not really at all.

434
00:09:42,526 --> 00:09:43,359
Pink is up.

435
00:09:43,359 --> 00:09:44,192
Yeah, this one's--

436
00:09:44,192 --> 00:09:45,025
'Cuz see, as they melt

437
00:09:45,025 --> 00:09:46,289
they get more and more slimy,

438
00:09:46,289 --> 00:09:47,122
as you guys can tell.

439
00:09:47,122 --> 00:09:48,077
So, we're gonna pop this one here.

440
00:09:48,077 --> 00:09:49,110
- [Devan] Nice! - There we go.

441
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:49,943
Bam!

442
00:09:49,943 --> 00:09:50,776
This one seems really melted.

443
00:09:50,776 --> 00:09:51,756
It's getting easy to get pretty flexible.

444
00:09:51,756 --> 00:09:52,589
- [Devan] That looks cool though.

445
00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:53,739
It makes it more slimy. - Look at that.

446
00:09:53,739 --> 00:09:54,572
Yeah, here we go.

447
00:09:54,572 --> 00:09:55,616
Now, we're gonna grab some duct tape.

448
00:09:55,616 --> 00:09:57,008
Gonna not try to pull a Devan here.

449
00:09:57,008 --> 00:09:57,841
- [Devan] Good choice.

450
00:09:57,841 --> 00:09:58,703
Smart choice. - There we go. Bam!

451
00:09:58,703 --> 00:09:59,910
- [Devan] Dude, it's not even tight.

452
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:02,545
- Devan, I need the haters to back off.

453
00:10:02,545 --> 00:10:04,764
And then, we can go like this here.

454
00:10:04,764 --> 00:10:05,597
And then, we'll get one--

455
00:10:05,597 --> 00:10:06,430
Yeah, that should be--

456
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:07,263
This is perfect.

457
00:10:07,263 --> 00:10:08,554
All right. Here we go.

458
00:10:08,554 --> 00:10:09,674
So, Devan's gonna gold the base.

459
00:10:09,674 --> 00:10:10,817
No, no. The base down here.

460
00:10:10,817 --> 00:10:11,650
- Oh, the base.

461
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:12,483
Oh, okay. Gotcha.

462
00:10:12,483 --> 00:10:13,934
- We're about to spin the world's largest

463
00:10:13,934 --> 00:10:15,236
slime fidget spinner

464
00:10:15,236 --> 00:10:16,521
and I want you to comment down below

465
00:10:16,521 --> 00:10:19,179
what should we make a fidget spinner out of next?

466
00:10:19,179 --> 00:10:20,012
All right, here we go.

467
00:10:20,012 --> 00:10:21,345
Three, two, one.

468
00:10:22,505 --> 00:10:24,887
(excited shouting)

469
00:10:24,887 --> 00:10:26,675
- It works! - What?

470
00:10:26,675 --> 00:10:30,008
(intense hip hop music)
