1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,200
- You asked us to make cheap versus expensive foods.

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,660
We're making three different dishes,

3
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,070
and the winner gets this $10,000 Starbucks drink

4
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:06,903
so let's go.

5
00:00:06,903 --> 00:00:08,180
You challenged us to make a burger

6
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:09,860
and once set of ingredients are really cheap.

7
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,360
- [Devan] And the other is super expensive.

8
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,360
- [Collins] But we don't know which are which,

9
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,840
so right now, let's make some burgers.

10
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,760
I'm starting off by spraying 24 carat gold onto my buns.

11
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,120
This is gonna make it so expensive.

12
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,270
- [Devan] I'm slicing up my cabbage.

13
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:20,943
- [Collins] Little spritz of gold just like this brother.

14
00:00:20,943 --> 00:00:21,776
- [Devan] Oh, oh.

15
00:00:21,776 --> 00:00:22,800
- This is so expensive, man.

16
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,400
- That's some fool's gold, dude.

17
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,530
- Next up, time to make some very expensive

18
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,490
Sriracha mayo, and the way that I know

19
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:28,323
this is very expensive

20
00:00:28,323 --> 00:00:29,840
is because the chickens who lay the eggs

21
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,090
are all decked out in Gucci.

22
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:32,870
- [Devan] All right, well I'm making a vinaigrette sauce.

23
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:34,090
Is this what I think it is?

24
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:34,923
- [Collins] I hope not.

25
00:00:34,923 --> 00:00:36,584
- We'll know by the smell.

26
00:00:36,584 --> 00:00:37,930
Okay, got it.

27
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:39,760
It's vinaigrette or something like that.

28
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,410
I spilled it all, all right.

29
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:42,430
- [Collins] That does not look good.

30
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:44,920
- [Devan] These are like hundred dollar lemons.

31
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,753
- [Collins] What?

32
00:00:45,753 --> 00:00:47,070
- I bet you these lemons are more expensive

33
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,430
than any other ingredient on this table right now.

34
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:51,410
- I have a full piece of whatever this is.

35
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:52,913
You think those lemons are more expensive

36
00:00:52,913 --> 00:00:54,120
than this high quality,

37
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,890
extremely rare hunk of-- - I do.

38
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:56,723
- Stuff.

39
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,080
And now, it's time for me to make my hamburger so boom--

40
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,330
- Whoa! - This is my ham,

41
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:00,890
and it's time to turn it into a burger.

42
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:02,870
- Have you ever seen oil like this before?

43
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:05,280
Wait a second, this smells like that truffle stuff.

44
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,113
- Wait, let me smell it.

45
00:01:06,113 --> 00:01:08,090
- It must be truffle oil.

46
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:08,923
By the way Collins,

47
00:01:08,923 --> 00:01:10,660
I really don't think that's the hamburger meat.

48
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:11,980
- You know what, mine's got two meats,

49
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:13,360
that means it's double as expensive.

50
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,620
Wait, so now you're pouring oil in?

51
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,930
- Yep, adding it very slowly.

52
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,730
All right, enough of that, now it's time to make my pen.

53
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:18,563
- [Collins] And it's time for me

54
00:01:18,563 --> 00:01:19,419
to slice up some meat here,

55
00:01:19,419 --> 00:01:20,252
so here we go. - Oh.

56
00:01:20,252 --> 00:01:21,085
- Holy cow, this stuff is very resilient.

57
00:01:21,085 --> 00:01:22,170
- Ah. - It's like a carpet.

58
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:23,120
Holy cow.

59
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,830
This has got to be expensive stuff, man.

60
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:26,368
I think you added way too much meat in there,

61
00:01:26,368 --> 00:01:27,860
to be honest bro. - Wait a second, it's stuck.

62
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:28,693
- [Collins] Yeah, I don't think

63
00:01:28,693 --> 00:01:29,526
you're doing it right, Devan.

64
00:01:29,526 --> 00:01:31,030
So here we go, let's just, gonna get some slices

65
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:31,863
here like this.

66
00:01:31,863 --> 00:01:32,696
- [Devan] I think I am, dude.

67
00:01:32,696 --> 00:01:35,250
Look, this is gonna be one meaty burger.

68
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,490
- How you gonna cook it all the way through,

69
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:37,990
it's gonna be raw in the center, bro.

70
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:39,130
It's so thick and ugh.

71
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:40,730
I now gotta slice up some jalapeno peppers.

72
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:42,440
Now, these do not look spicy at all, man.

73
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,273
- What, are you kidding?

74
00:01:43,273 --> 00:01:45,260
It's red, dude, why would you take a bite of it?

75
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,516
- Yeah, it's just not spicy. - Are you serious?

76
00:01:46,516 --> 00:01:47,490
- Bro, it's not spicy at all. - Oh jeez, oh dude.

77
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,370
Do you see what's happening to yourself?

78
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:50,330
- Okay, it's a little spicy. - Dude, look at you.

79
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:51,734
- It's a little spicy. - Can you see yourself?

80
00:01:51,734 --> 00:01:53,993
- It's getting a little hot. - Oh man, it's really hot.

81
00:01:55,007 --> 00:01:55,840
It's hot!

82
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:00,872
Devin?

83
00:02:00,872 --> 00:02:04,120
- Oh jeez, why does that stuff always happen to you, dude?

84
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,820
Oh, I wonder what this stuff is?

85
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:06,910
- [Collins] Whoa, man, every time bro,

86
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,210
this onion really gets to me, bro.

87
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:09,043
What is that?

88
00:02:09,043 --> 00:02:10,368
- I don't know, it's mysterious.

89
00:02:10,368 --> 00:02:11,410
(Collin yells)

90
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:12,780
Dude, are you seeing this stuff?

91
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,500
- I can't see much of anything right now, Devan,

92
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,370
it's all pretty blurry.

93
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:16,640
- [Devan] I don't think adding carrots

94
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,750
to this was a good idea.

95
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:19,587
- It looks kind of like beef in a weird way.

96
00:02:19,587 --> 00:02:20,420
(Collin yells)

97
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,440
Why am I so sensitive to onions?

98
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,500
- [Devan] Next up, I'm adding a dash of olive oil.

99
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,110
- Three, two, one, little saucer.

100
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:26,943
Oh! - Yes!

101
00:02:26,943 --> 00:02:27,790
- [Collins] Next up, we're gonna go straight

102
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:28,960
from the eggs into the batter.

103
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,070
- Now, I have to figure out how to use these things.

104
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:31,903
- [Collins] The little rocks?

105
00:02:31,903 --> 00:02:34,490
- I think I'm just gonna dump it in like this, you ready?

106
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:35,870
- [Both] Oh!

107
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,720
Whoa!

108
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,610
- [Collins] It's like a ghost.

109
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:39,590
- [Devan] Time to pam it up.

110
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,370
- [Collins] And time to season my meat stuff.

111
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,283
So, here we go.

112
00:02:42,283 --> 00:02:44,780
Gotta season over there, gotta season your grill first,

113
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,650
Devan, you gotta make sure you get a whole bunch

114
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:47,483
of seasoning, bro.

115
00:02:47,483 --> 00:02:48,570
- I'll season it later.

116
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:50,143
- [Both] Oh!

117
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,880
- It smells like burning pepper.

118
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,240
- [Devan] What did you do?

119
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,073
- All right, oh boy.

120
00:02:55,073 --> 00:02:55,906
- Don't waft it towards me.

121
00:02:55,906 --> 00:02:56,739
- [Collins] All right, next up, here we go,

122
00:02:56,739 --> 00:02:58,620
we gotta go for the meat and I'm gonna form the patty,

123
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,460
Devan, and it's really just all in the wrist.

124
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,293
- [Devan] All right, I think it's time

125
00:03:01,293 --> 00:03:02,310
to flip my patty, here we go.

126
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,180
Three, two, one, yes!

127
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,290
- [Collins] Oh, it looks wack.

128
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,640
Three, two, one, - I don't mind it.

129
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,510
- [Collins] Oh what an immediate sizzle bro, woo hoo!

130
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:12,190
All right, here we go, it's gonna flatten down like this,

131
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,460
oh boy, it's really going now.

132
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,650
- [Devan] I've got my perfect square cheese right here.

133
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:16,483
- You made a fundamental mistake, Devan,

134
00:03:16,483 --> 00:03:18,100
because see you're trying to cook it on the top,

135
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,040
you're supposed to flip it over like that, boom,

136
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,680
freshly hot and then melt the cheese.

137
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,540
First step, here we go, I gotta season the buns.

138
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,373
- [Devan] Oh, wow, yeah, that's--

139
00:03:25,373 --> 00:03:26,206
- [Collins] Here we go, that's the first step.

140
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,870
- [Devan] Look at this sauce.

141
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,360
- Next up, I've got my Sriracha mayo.

142
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,193
So, here we go,

143
00:03:30,193 --> 00:03:32,140
just gonna take in just a little drizzle right there,

144
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,017
and a little drizzle down over here.

145
00:03:33,017 --> 00:03:35,240
The way the pink contrasts against the black bun

146
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,540
actually looks really good, bro.

147
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,450
I think mine might be the expensive one, Devan.

148
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,283
- Who are you kidding?

149
00:03:39,283 --> 00:03:40,530
It looks like it's from the dollar menu.

150
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,300
- Yeah, the $1,000 menu, Devan.

151
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,320
Wait, what is that?

152
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,930
- [Devan] This is my coleslaw.

153
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,120
- Next up, time to add my first burger on here,

154
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,486
so here we go, look at it, just dripping with the juice.

155
00:03:49,486 --> 00:03:51,560
(Collin yelling)

156
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,910
It's so heavy and meaty.

157
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:55,470
See, Devan, yours is gonna fail, bro, for sure.

158
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,303
It's all cheap.

159
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:57,270
You ain't got nothin', bro.

160
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,023
Next up we got some of this colder meat, so here we go,

161
00:03:59,023 --> 00:04:00,850
just gonna place the colder meat on top.

162
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,690
Time for patty number two right now,

163
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,260
just look at that dripping. (Devan sneezes)

164
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,310
Get it right here on top just like this, oh man.

165
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,660
Okay here we go, just gonna slide it off.

166
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,590
Oh stay fam!

167
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,423
We gotta move quickly, now.

168
00:04:09,423 --> 00:04:10,660
Well, here we go, just gonna pop the onion ring

169
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,501
on top like that.

170
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:12,530
We're gonna put a couple finishing touches on it,

171
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:13,866
and bro it is going to be delicious.

172
00:04:13,866 --> 00:04:14,699
(both yelling)

173
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:16,240
It's fallen apart, I gotta fix this thing up.

174
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,500
Well give me, I might need a moment.

175
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,800
If size is any indication

176
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,060
of which burger's more expensive,

177
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,160
mine is definitely

178
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,210
the more expensive one. - It is not, though.

179
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,200
- So here's the big reveal.

180
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,800
- [Both] Ready, set, go!

181
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,633
Tah dah!

182
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:26,900
- [Collins] You can comment down below and vote,

183
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,800
whose burger do you think is more expensive?

184
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,480
We'll be tasting them and finding out the prices

185
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,360
at the end of the video. (bell dinging)

186
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,860
You challenged us to make macaroni and cheese

187
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:33,693
and remember,

188
00:04:33,693 --> 00:04:36,037
one set of ingredients is worth more than 500 dollars.

189
00:04:36,037 --> 00:04:36,960
- [Devan] But the other set

190
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,070
of ingredients is only worth 11 dollars.

191
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,110
- But we don't know which are which,

192
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,930
so right now, let's make some macaroni and cheese.

193
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:43,260
I'm kicking off by making a whole bunch

194
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,870
of cheese because cheese is the core

195
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,380
of the macaroni and cheese, so here we go.

196
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,970
- And to kick mine off, I'm making a roux.

197
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,900
Next up, I add some flour here.

198
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,090
Guess what, Collins, this is very expensive flour.

199
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,480
This is First Street flour. (bell dings)

200
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,313
That's right,

201
00:04:54,313 --> 00:04:55,146
it's not second street (buzzer moans)

202
00:04:55,146 --> 00:04:55,979
or third street, (buzzer moans)

203
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:56,900
so it's gotta be expensive.

204
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,010
- Although your flour's expensive,

205
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:58,987
I think my cheese is super expensive.

206
00:04:58,987 --> 00:05:01,320
Smells like a crusty old man's feet.

207
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,820
That's how you know it's good cheese, Devan.

208
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:04,170
- How do you know how that smells?

209
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,220
- I would prefer not to answer.

210
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,410
- Next up, I think I'm gonna add some cream cheese,

211
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:09,220
maybe, and some mustard powder.

212
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,053
- Oh, snap,

213
00:05:10,053 --> 00:05:11,264
I almost forgot the most important part, Devan.

214
00:05:11,264 --> 00:05:12,097
(bell dings) Seasoning,

215
00:05:12,097 --> 00:05:12,930
I haven't seasoned it yet.

216
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:13,763
- [Devan] Ah, yes of course.

217
00:05:13,763 --> 00:05:14,970
- Gotta season my cheese.

218
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:15,863
Do you want some seasoning?

219
00:05:15,863 --> 00:05:17,139
- What? None of that, none of that.

220
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:19,039
- All right, for my final cheese here,

221
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:20,783
Swiss.

222
00:05:20,783 --> 00:05:22,370
- Next up, I'm gonna add some of this milk.

223
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,570
This is super expensive milk.

224
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:24,403
You know how I know?

225
00:05:24,403 --> 00:05:26,170
Because it just looks expensive.

226
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,530
- My cheese is at the perfect consistency,

227
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:28,520
and now we've go the noodles here.

228
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:31,117
You can tell these are very fine ravioli noodles.

229
00:05:31,117 --> 00:05:33,460
Yo, dude, my cheese is so satisfying.

230
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,760
Three, two, one, does the cheese pour down like this.

231
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,010
This just looks absolutely luscious.

232
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,371
Now time to mix it all up with the noodles

233
00:05:39,371 --> 00:05:40,264
so here we go it's gonna go.

234
00:05:40,264 --> 00:05:42,240
Oh!

235
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,780
I feel like I'm just like yodeling right now,

236
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,240
but that's how good this stuff is bro.

237
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,620
It's turning me into a yodeler.

238
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,800
Next up here I got some pancetta,

239
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,260
or should we say panscketta?

240
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,093
- Neither of those.

241
00:05:51,093 --> 00:05:52,160
- So, I'm just gonna slice this up

242
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,300
into small little cubes.

243
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,910
It looks like licorice on the inside.

244
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:57,380
The only issue with my pancetta is that

245
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,045
it doesn't smell like there's a lot of flavor in it,

246
00:05:59,045 --> 00:06:00,330
so I'm gonna take just a smidge of salt.

247
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:02,050
What is that, what are you doing?

248
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:03,840
- [Devan] I'm adding it to the center of my noodles

249
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,010
to add extra flair.

250
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,520
- Wait, so your noodles are gonna have cheese

251
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,750
on the inside of the noodle.

252
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,300
- Individually done.

253
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,670
- [Collins] That's like taking Pizza Hut stuffed crust

254
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,700
to the next level, bro.

255
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,120
Next up, we're gonna get some ground up grass over here.

256
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,793
And then, just a smidge of the truffle butter here.

257
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:17,390
Just gonna place it on like this.

258
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:20,000
- I don't know anyone who would ever spend this much time

259
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,860
on their mac and cheese,

260
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:21,730
but I gotta tell ya,

261
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:23,890
this is gonna be the most delicious mac and cheese

262
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:24,723
I've ever seen.

263
00:06:24,723 --> 00:06:25,800
- All right, here we go, gonna add this paste

264
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,240
on the top here, and this is what we call

265
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,370
basting ya' paste.

266
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,640
Are you doing all of those noodles?

267
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,510
- Oh yeah, at least enough to fill this thing up.

268
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,170
- Time to shock the meat and add a whole bunch

269
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:35,640
of extra flavor into it, so here we go.

270
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,700
Three, two, one.

271
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,543
- [Both] Oh!

272
00:06:38,543 --> 00:06:41,270
- Look at that, flavor infused, baby.

273
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,140
I got my pancetta here, and next up,

274
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,199
it's time to add in some truffle butter, so here we go.

275
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,240
(both yelling)

276
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,740
- No! - How does that even happen?

277
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,573
- I mean, yes.

278
00:06:49,573 --> 00:06:51,360
- [Collins] Gonna add my truffle mustard butter on.

279
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,220
What are you doing?

280
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,260
- [Devan] I broke the shell.

281
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,646
- [Collins] Oh, you're cutting out the lobster meat?

282
00:06:54,646 --> 00:06:55,479
- [Devan] Yep.

283
00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:56,490
- Lobster meat's usually really expensive, right?

284
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,090
- Oh yeah, dude, especially this one.

285
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,760
Time to take all my amazing ingredients here,

286
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,980
scoop them on to the spatula.

287
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,432
Three, two, one.

288
00:07:02,432 --> 00:07:03,620
(both yelling)

289
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,477
Man dude, listen to that sizzle, bro.

290
00:07:05,477 --> 00:07:06,450
- All right. - That's crazy.

291
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,510
- You know what they say, Collins,

292
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,602
when life gives you lemons,

293
00:07:08,602 --> 00:07:10,060
you add them to your lobster. - You make lemonade.

294
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,050
- Wait, what?

295
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:11,883
- No, you make lemonade.

296
00:07:11,883 --> 00:07:13,410
I've never heard the saying like that before, man.

297
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:14,720
- It really draws out the flavor.

298
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,320
I almost forgot about the most important ingredient,

299
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,030
Collins, this is truffle salt.

300
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:20,770
- Like, that's gotta be like 50 or 60 dollars,

301
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:22,040
just for the salt alone.

302
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,487
- Dude, I think it's closer to $120,000,000,000.

303
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,870
All right, I think next up

304
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,400
I'm gonna drizzle the cheese on top.

305
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,660
Looks like pure money.

306
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,420
- And I got my truffle peganeenee over here,

307
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,253
so here we go now,

308
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:35,550
just gonna lay my pehgahkneeknee down.

309
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:36,383
Oh, look at that bro.

310
00:07:36,383 --> 00:07:37,490
All right, well you know what then,

311
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,540
for the most expensive cheese of them all,

312
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,040
we gotta get that off of there.

313
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,185
Check this out, bro.

314
00:07:41,185 --> 00:07:42,770
(both yelling)

315
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:43,603
Look at this.

316
00:07:43,603 --> 00:07:44,510
- Now it's time to assemble it,

317
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,740
and see how this thing turns out.

318
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,070
This looks so cheesy.

319
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,730
- Yeah and mine actually surprisingly came together,

320
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:49,670
so here is the big reveal.

321
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:50,710
- [Both] Three, two--

322
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:51,543
- Oh wait.

323
00:07:51,543 --> 00:07:52,376
- We have five second subscribe challenge.

324
00:07:52,376 --> 00:07:53,900
We want to see if you can subscribe to this channel

325
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,040
and turn on the channel pulse notifications in five seconds.

326
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,090
You ready, Here we go.

327
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:00,930
- [Both] Five, four, three,

328
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:01,763
two,

329
00:08:01,763 --> 00:08:02,596
one, done.

330
00:08:02,596 --> 00:08:03,429
- If you can do that,

331
00:08:03,429 --> 00:08:04,820
comment down below Keyper Squad, right now.

332
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,571
- [Both] Ready, set, go, ta-da!

333
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:09,490
- [Collin] Oh my gosh man, I mean what?

334
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:10,600
- [Devan] Yours has gold leaf?

335
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,620
- Right now, comment down below

336
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,450
and vote whose do you think is more expensive?

337
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:14,650
We can't wait to go through the comments

338
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,200
and see if you were able to get it right.

339
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,033
We'll be tasting them

340
00:08:17,033 --> 00:08:18,660
and finding out the prices at the end of the video.

341
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,920
You challenged us to make tacos,

342
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,527
and one set of ingredients is worth more than 400 dollars.

343
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,040
- [Devan] But the other set of ingredients

344
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,427
is only worth 17 dollars.

345
00:08:25,427 --> 00:08:26,610
- And we don't know which are which,

346
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:28,120
so right now let's make some tacos.

347
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,980
I'm gonna kick it off by tenderizing my meat right now,

348
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:32,040
but I've also heard you can call this bonkin the meat.

349
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,880
- I think this is gonna be the base to my polenta,

350
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,640
I'm not really sure, kind of guessing right now.

351
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,180
To top it off, I'm gonna add some cheese.

352
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,470
- And I've got a lemon here,

353
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:39,700
and I've heard that lemon on steak

354
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,533
tastes absolutely amazing.

355
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:41,900
That's how you grate cheese bro?

356
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,733
All the cheese is stuck in the middle, man.

357
00:08:42,733 --> 00:08:43,980
You have to hold it upright. - What?

358
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,470
- You just dumped it all out the side.

359
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,830
Next up, gotta season my steak.

360
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,470
So here we go, got some huge Himalayan salt,

361
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,303
and if you notice, Devan,

362
00:08:50,303 --> 00:08:51,193
the color similarity between the two,

363
00:08:51,193 --> 00:08:52,730
that means these are paired

364
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,650
they're perfectly matched and meant to go together.

365
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:55,960
- Next up, I'm gonna use whatever

366
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,300
this sausage-looking stuff is.

367
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,750
- [Collins] It looks like you got that from Amazon.

368
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,783
- It looks like it's got corn in there.

369
00:08:59,783 --> 00:09:01,660
Can you add some seasoning to mine, man?

370
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,900
- Excuse me, Devan, I am a chef.

371
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,510
How much would you like?

372
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,343
- Well you haven't studied yet.

373
00:09:05,343 --> 00:09:07,630
- That's about 400 dollars of my super expensive pepper.

374
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,930
The top of my steak is seasoned,

375
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:10,560
the bottom of it is completely bare.

376
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,900
Oh man, oh boy, just sizzling bro,

377
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,840
it's popping off right now.

378
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,673
- [Devan] Time to get my hands in.

379
00:09:14,673 --> 00:09:15,800
- [Collins] So, this is either cheap beef,

380
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,640
or it's woo-goo beef.

381
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,930
- No, Collins, it's Wagyu.

382
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:19,640
- No, Wagyu's the pasta sauce, Devan.

383
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,473
Woo-goo beef.

384
00:09:20,473 --> 00:09:21,370
- I think that's Ragu.

385
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:22,690
- Now I gotta flip my steak over,

386
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:23,523
oh my gosh.

387
00:09:23,523 --> 00:09:24,820
But the bottom looks actually pretty good.

388
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:25,653
Oh but you know what sorry,

389
00:09:25,653 --> 00:09:27,093
I can't forget to season the underside now so here we go,

390
00:09:27,093 --> 00:09:28,287
just gonna season this.

391
00:09:28,287 --> 00:09:29,820
I'm all about the seasoning, man.

392
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,606
With my crystal salt. - Oh yes, here ya go.

393
00:09:31,606 --> 00:09:32,570
Here's a little extra seasoning.

394
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:34,300
- Get your cheap ingredients out of here, Devan.

395
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,373
- This is my most expensive one, you know it.

396
00:09:35,373 --> 00:09:36,832
- I don't think so, man.

397
00:09:36,832 --> 00:09:37,788
#DevanHasCheapSalt

398
00:09:37,788 --> 00:09:39,380
All right, so next up here going to be making my tortillas.

399
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,340
Yo this comes together

400
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,250
and starts binding extremely quickly, man.

401
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,760
Just gotta kind of keep squeezing it.

402
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,970
So here we go, next up we have a tortilla maker.

403
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:48,400
Holy cow. - Whoa!

404
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,853
- This thing looks like a weight you'd find at the gym, man.

405
00:09:50,853 --> 00:09:52,110
All right, here we go, got a little ball.

406
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,660
Devan, what are you doing?

407
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,493
- [Devan] All right!

408
00:09:54,493 --> 00:09:55,326
- This is an interception. - Yes.

409
00:09:55,326 --> 00:09:56,159
- You can't just-- - What do you mean?

410
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:56,992
You're holding

411
00:09:56,992 --> 00:09:57,825
it open for me, right? - That's gonna make a waffle,

412
00:09:57,825 --> 00:09:58,800
not a tortilla right there, man.

413
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,520
You've hijacked my tortilla machine.

414
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,760
- [Devan] Just like this here.

415
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,953
- [Collins] That's a huge, unmanageable tortilla, man.

416
00:10:02,953 --> 00:10:04,710
- Nice, this is just perfect, okay?

417
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,540
And then you just lift it up.

418
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,373
- Are you done?

419
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:09,600
- [Devan] I think next up I'm gonna make some pico de gallo.

420
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,550
- [Collins] And I've actually got a great idea

421
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,450
for my taco shell here.

422
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:12,440
I'm gonna use some of this stuff.

423
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,501
- That's not just stuff, that's gold leaf.

424
00:10:14,501 --> 00:10:15,590
- All right, I'm gonna dip this chunk right here

425
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:16,440
in the gold leaf.

426
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,490
Here we go, three, two, one,

427
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:18,800
and then just see what comes up.

428
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,340
Oh my gosh bro, it's like all gold leaf.

429
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,910
Wait Devan, airborne gold leaf.

430
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,340
- [Devan] No, don't blow it away, dude.

431
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,670
- You walk up to a customer and you go sir.

432
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,430
- No, no, no, no, you shouldn't do that, no!

433
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:28,910
Is it edible?

434
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,560
- You are now gold on the inside

435
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,740
and on the oh my gosh, Devan, are you feeling okay?

436
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,573
- Yes!

437
00:10:33,573 --> 00:10:35,210
- You look a little bit-- - I feel really valuable.

438
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:36,450
With this newfound gold power,

439
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:37,880
I think I have the Midas touch.

440
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,930
- Oh, what? - You ready?

441
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:39,763
Boom!

442
00:10:39,763 --> 00:10:40,596
- Oh my gosh, bro. - Yes!

443
00:10:40,596 --> 00:10:41,702
- Dude, I'm for sure-- - Boom!

444
00:10:41,702 --> 00:10:42,770
- Devan!

445
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:45,330
Touch my steak, turn my steak gold.

446
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,410
- Never! - It'll turn it expensive.

447
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:47,243
- Boom!

448
00:10:47,243 --> 00:10:48,076
- Please just touch my steak.

449
00:10:48,076 --> 00:10:48,909
- That's a cheap steak,

450
00:10:48,909 --> 00:10:49,820
can't be done. - Come on, man.

451
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:50,653
- I just can't do it.

452
00:10:50,653 --> 00:10:52,230
- Time to make a gold leaf tortilla, here we go.

453
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,063
Three, two, one.

454
00:10:53,063 --> 00:10:53,896
Just gonna put this on top just like this.

455
00:10:53,896 --> 00:10:55,790
All right let's see how the gold leaf taco turned out.

456
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:56,730
Here we go, three.

457
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,300
- [Both] Two, one.

458
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,133
Oh!

459
00:10:59,133 --> 00:11:00,630
- [Collin] That looks super awesome, bro.

460
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:01,463
- [Devan] That's amazing.

461
00:11:01,463 --> 00:11:02,296
- [Collin] Why'd you chop the onions like that, man?

462
00:11:02,296 --> 00:11:04,410
- [Devan] What do you mean, this is how you do it for pico.

463
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,900
- All right, next up here we're gonna take my steak.

464
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,092
Three, two, one.

465
00:11:08,092 --> 00:11:09,410
(pan dings)

466
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:10,243
- Yes!

467
00:11:12,033 --> 00:11:13,920
There's no way that's expensive anymore.

468
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,790
It's on the floor.

469
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,320
- Let's try this again, here we go, one more time.

470
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,183
Three, two, one.

471
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,845
- Well, duh.

472
00:11:20,845 --> 00:11:21,678
(Collin moaning)

473
00:11:21,678 --> 00:11:22,907
How did you mess that up?

474
00:11:22,907 --> 00:11:23,796
(tinkling sound)

475
00:11:23,796 --> 00:11:25,500
Well, I think it's time for me to move on to my fish.

476
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,090
I have to say, I'm not very appreciative

477
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,950
of this fake gold stuff on my fish.

478
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,590
You know, this is really expensive stuff here.

479
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:31,920
You've just downgraded the quality.

480
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,970
- Next up, time to make my very expensive guacamole,

481
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:35,810
so we're gonna start off by seasoning the outside

482
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:37,900
of the avocados like that, there we go.

483
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,323
Just quick rotation around like this, all right.

484
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:41,450
Learned this in chef school, there's a rotation.

485
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,590
- I think you learned that from my mom.

486
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:43,700
- That was my chef's school.

487
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,313
Three, two, one.

488
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,183
I missed.

489
00:11:47,183 --> 00:11:48,071
Three, two, one.

490
00:11:48,071 --> 00:11:48,904
There we go, okay just like this.

491
00:11:48,904 --> 00:11:50,590
All right here we go be very careful,

492
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,630
do not try this at home, here we go like that.

493
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,670
Boom, the seed is out, wood chop.

494
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,100
That's enough of the seed, yeet.

495
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,070
Okay, oopsie.

496
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:58,210
- All right, my fish is shredded

497
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:59,910
and now I think I'm gonna build the taco.

498
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,560
- We have the tortillas and all of our ingredients,

499
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,160
and it's time to assemble the tacos.

500
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,190
First of all, got my beef here, and I don't know, man,

501
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:06,750
the jury is still out on whether this is expensive

502
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,298
or cheap right here, but we're gonna be adding this in.

503
00:12:08,298 --> 00:12:09,131
- I think it's cheap.

504
00:12:09,131 --> 00:12:10,410
Laying down my polenta stuff right now,

505
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:11,540
just doing a little dollop.

506
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,770
- Gonna add in some beef right here,

507
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:14,460
I gotta say the gold leaf on the inside

508
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,550
is a definite cool move.

509
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:18,157
Oh my gosh I forgot to season it!

510
00:12:18,157 --> 00:12:18,990
- [Devan] Oh, man!

511
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:20,550
- How could I forget the most essential step

512
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,530
off the bat, bro.

513
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:23,090
There's a little bit of a surf and turf.

514
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:25,000
The beef is surfing, the flowers are turfing.

515
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,770
- Wait, are you sure those flowers are edible?

516
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:28,630
- I don't know, man, I guess we just find out, right?

517
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:30,425
- I thought that they were just decoration.

518
00:12:30,425 --> 00:12:31,258
(Collin moans) What?

519
00:12:31,258 --> 00:12:32,260
(Collin gags)

520
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,410
Wait dude, what was wrong?

521
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:35,380
- Oh my gosh, no seasoning!

522
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,730
Those flowers were super bland.

523
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:38,597
Gotta season up my flowers, bro.

524
00:12:38,597 --> 00:12:39,720
- That's all it was?

525
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,553
- That's all it was.

526
00:12:40,553 --> 00:12:41,950
I don't know what part of the surf and turf this is.

527
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:43,333
- Check out this spoon, dude.

528
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,650
I think it's made of some oyster shell or something.

529
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:46,750
- Dude, is that caviar?

530
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,890
- Oh yeah, it is.

531
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:49,820
- Oh my gosh, I think that might be the expensive one

532
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,670
because caviar I've heard is very expensive.

533
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,010
- [Devan] It is super expensive.

534
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:54,620
- All right here we go, got some lobster bro.

535
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,180
This looks like a little worm.

536
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,070
- That's really cheap.

537
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:57,903
Super cheap. - So here we go,

538
00:12:57,903 --> 00:12:59,510
we're gonna place the lobster down like that on top.

539
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:02,400
- Now the plan is, if any of my other ingredients are cheap,

540
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,030
I'm going to cover it with this super expensive caviar

541
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,610
so it's kind of like a type of surprise.

542
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:07,850
You bite in there and the fish is like,

543
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:08,850
Yo, I'm here! (laughs)

544
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:10,630
And then you bite into it and the pico de gallo's like,

545
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:11,870
Hey, I'm diced up tomatoes!

546
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,486
- [Collins] Next up, we got a chunk of dirt right here,

547
00:13:13,486 --> 00:13:14,370
this has got to be cheap.

548
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:15,260
- You know what that is, right?

549
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,480
- It's an expensive chunk of dirt, I don't know.

550
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,010
What is it? - No, it's a truffle, dude!

551
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:20,450
Those things are super expensive.

552
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:21,283
- If it really is a truffle,

553
00:13:21,283 --> 00:13:22,410
I guess that's somewhat expensive,

554
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:23,460
so might as well add this to it,

555
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,293
so here we go.

556
00:13:24,293 --> 00:13:25,830
It's gonna go like this a couple of shavings like that.

557
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:27,800
- [Devan] This thing is loaded with caviar.

558
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,990
- Well, I've got a couple finishing touches

559
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:29,823
to put on mine-- - Same.

560
00:13:29,823 --> 00:13:31,350
- But I'm really excited to see which one's expensive,

561
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,660
which one's cheap, but ultimately,

562
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,600
to see how they turn out.

563
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,380
We've got the finished tacos, and I've gotta say, man,

564
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,470
mine is the creme-de-la-taco of tacos.

565
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,070
- I don't think so, mine's definitely better.

566
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:40,230
- [Both] Three, two, oh wait, wait, wait.

567
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,520
- Three second like challenge.

568
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,780
We want to see if you can like this video in three seconds.

569
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,613
Are you ready?

570
00:13:44,613 --> 00:13:47,400
Here we go, three, two, one,

571
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,233
done.

572
00:13:48,233 --> 00:13:49,440
Ready, set, go.

573
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,273
Ta-da! (surprising music chimes)

574
00:13:50,273 --> 00:13:51,960
- [Both] I mean, that looks wack.

575
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,070
- [Collins] You get to comment down below,

576
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:55,030
and vote whose do you think is more expensive?

577
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,970
We'll be tasting them and finding out prices

578
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:57,960
at the end of the video.

579
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,793
We've got the completed burgers,

580
00:13:58,793 --> 00:13:59,930
and I'm so excited to find out

581
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:01,360
which one's expensive, which one's cheap,

582
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,290
and how they taste.

583
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:04,870
- Yeah, so Collins, which one do you think is expensive?

584
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:07,740
- See, I think Devan that mine's the expensive one, bro.

585
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,530
There's two patties on it, tons of cheese, golden buns.

586
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:11,380
- That's pretty true,

587
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,670
I think I kind of have to agree with you.

588
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:13,870
- Yours, ehh.

589
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:14,882
- Looks pretty normal, you know?

590
00:14:14,882 --> 00:14:15,858
- You receive that at a restaurant

591
00:14:15,858 --> 00:14:16,770
and it's like one of those things

592
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:17,650
where you're waiting for your food and it's like, oh.

593
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,610
- Then you see yours, and you're like--

594
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:20,520
- Yeah!

595
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,470
Now before we find out which one's the most expensive,

596
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,650
it's time to taste them, so, Devan?

597
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:24,483
- Yes? - Which one should we

598
00:14:24,483 --> 00:14:25,316
try first?

599
00:14:25,316 --> 00:14:26,149
- [Devan] I think let's do mine first.

600
00:14:26,149 --> 00:14:27,560
- [Both] Oh!

601
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,393
- [Devan] Yes.

602
00:14:28,393 --> 00:14:29,226
- This looks amazing!

603
00:14:29,226 --> 00:14:30,610
- I mean, it's very underwhelming

604
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:31,705
and I'm not at all impressed.

605
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:32,538
- What?

606
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,371
You just made an oh sound.

607
00:14:33,371 --> 00:14:34,720
- [Both] Oh.

608
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,553
- I gotta say, bro,

609
00:14:35,553 --> 00:14:37,950
from the inside, the quality looks very high on your burger.

610
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,610
Let's see if it tastes as cheap as I hope it does.

611
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:42,240
- [Both] Three, two, one.

612
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,240
- How'd you do that?

613
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:46,824
- Oh my goodness (mumbles)

614
00:14:46,824 --> 00:14:47,941
How you having so much trouble?

615
00:14:47,941 --> 00:14:49,061
What is going on, dude?

616
00:14:49,061 --> 00:14:50,270
- What?

617
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,103
Are you liking it?

618
00:14:51,103 --> 00:14:51,936
- I'm loving it.

619
00:14:51,936 --> 00:14:52,850
- Are you kidding me?

620
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:53,683
All right, here we go,

621
00:14:53,683 --> 00:14:55,160
so now it's gonna have to kind of hold it down like this,

622
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,032
hold it steady.

623
00:14:56,032 --> 00:14:58,440
(Collin yells)

624
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,070
Here's the reveal, the inside of the burger.

625
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:00,903
Here we go.

626
00:15:00,903 --> 00:15:02,357
- [Both] Three, two, one.

627
00:15:02,357 --> 00:15:05,160
(both yelling)

628
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,644
- It looks like the earth between different crust layers.

629
00:15:07,644 --> 00:15:08,477
- What?

630
00:15:08,477 --> 00:15:09,898
- [Both] Ready, set, go.

631
00:15:09,898 --> 00:15:11,733
(hip hop beats)

632
00:15:11,733 --> 00:15:14,316
(Devan grunts)

633
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,293
- Sriracha sauce.

634
00:15:17,293 --> 00:15:18,300
All right, now let's find out which burger

635
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,133
is the expensive one.

636
00:15:19,133 --> 00:15:22,118
So, here we go. - Three, two, one.

637
00:15:22,118 --> 00:15:23,533
- What? - Yes, I knew it!

638
00:15:23,533 --> 00:15:25,271
That tasted terrible.

639
00:15:25,271 --> 00:15:26,749
- Wait, 13 dollars and 50 cents?

640
00:15:26,749 --> 00:15:27,582
- What?

641
00:15:27,582 --> 00:15:29,530
That's way more expensive than it should have been.

642
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:30,363
- Than it should have been?

643
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:31,550
I thought it lived up to the standard.

644
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,570
- [Devan] It's gotta be the quail eggs, dude.

645
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:35,210
And the Wagyu beef. - No, I knew the Wagyu beef,

646
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,870
I think that's what drove the prices way up.

647
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,420
I mean, the cheese was really good as well.

648
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,560
'Cause added all together, Devan,

649
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,440
the final price of your burger is,

650
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,630
drumroll please.

651
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:45,100
- [Both] 466 dollars.

652
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,440
- Oh my gosh! - I know.

653
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,310
- You get to comment down below,

654
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:51,040
would you pay 466 dollars to be disappointed by a hamburger?

655
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:51,873
- Whoa, wait a second. - And right now,

656
00:15:51,873 --> 00:15:52,706
we're on to the next one.

657
00:15:52,706 --> 00:15:53,539
We've got the tacos,

658
00:15:53,539 --> 00:15:54,780
and it's finally time to find out

659
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,630
which one's expensive,

660
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,150
which one is cheap, and how they taste.

661
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,250
So, initial predictions, Devan.

662
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,260
Which is the expensive taco?

663
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,217
- You know what, I'm thinking it's yours, dude.

664
00:16:01,217 --> 00:16:04,050
You've got gold leaf, truffle, lobster--

665
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:05,210
- Or chunks of dirt.

666
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:06,660
I think yours is the expensive one.

667
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,860
With that amount of caviar,

668
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,700
I know caviar is extremely expensive.

669
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,120
- For this one, let's try mine first.

670
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,830
- Now, although I think yours is the expensive one,

671
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:14,930
I'm not excited to try it, because--

672
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:15,763
- Yeah.

673
00:16:15,763 --> 00:16:16,596
- That amount of caviar, bro,

674
00:16:16,596 --> 00:16:18,360
it's gonna be like a blast of salt in your mouth.

675
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,810
- I'll take a bite, then you take a bite.

676
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:22,720
Here we go. - Three, two, one.

677
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,600
- Oh, it's crunchy.

678
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,070
And the caviar, how am I supposed to take a bite, bro?

679
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:26,940
Are you kidding me?

680
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,050
There's nothing left in the taco, Devan.

681
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:31,013
You totally took the whole taco with you.

682
00:16:31,013 --> 00:16:31,846
- That's so gross.

683
00:16:31,846 --> 00:16:32,679
- It's so gross?

684
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:33,650
Well, the opinion is in.

685
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:35,500
Apparently, it tastes very gross.

686
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,677
All right, so we're going to use a spoon here

687
00:16:36,677 --> 00:16:38,280
and scoop it back in like this.

688
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,113
Three.

689
00:16:39,113 --> 00:16:39,946
- [Both] Two, one.

690
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,830
- The taco shell is the worst.

691
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:43,930
- That's way too much!

692
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:45,965
- That's the fishiest thing I have ever eaten, bro.

693
00:16:45,965 --> 00:16:46,800
- Yeah, I know. - That's gotta be

694
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,633
cheap caviar.

695
00:16:47,633 --> 00:16:50,591
So, we're gonna lift up and I'll take the first bite.

696
00:16:50,591 --> 00:16:52,941
(both yelling)

697
00:16:52,941 --> 00:16:53,774
- [Devan] How did that happen?

698
00:16:53,774 --> 00:16:55,150
- [Collin] I don't know take a bite, here we go.

699
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,870
- [Both] Three, two, one.

700
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,640
- If you want to win a 15 minute video call

701
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,473
with Devan and I,

702
00:16:59,473 --> 00:17:01,580
text the word cook to 81800 right now.

703
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,860
So, pause the video, text the word cook to 81800.

704
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,400
You'll automatically be entered to win.

705
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,270
Let's see how this tastes.

706
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:08,173
Ready, set, go.

707
00:17:09,169 --> 00:17:10,712
- Oh, how does it taste?

708
00:17:10,712 --> 00:17:11,720
What?

709
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,950
I'm just gonna go for the top.

710
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,363
You ready, three, two, one.

711
00:17:15,593 --> 00:17:17,810
(Devan grunts)

712
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:19,480
Your guacamole is so bad.

713
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,940
- All right, well now it's time to find out

714
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,850
what did they actually cost, so let's see.

715
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:24,901
Three, two, one.

716
00:17:24,901 --> 00:17:26,000
- Oh! - Yours?

717
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,833
How?

718
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:27,666
- I knew it bro.

719
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:28,730
- What? - Bland guacamole.

720
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:30,010
- It was so bad! - And all!

721
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:30,843
It was not.

722
00:17:30,843 --> 00:17:32,510
- [Devan] Mine was only 17 dollars?

723
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,513
- Only 17, dude 17 dollars?

724
00:17:33,513 --> 00:17:35,700
- I had so much caviar on there.

725
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,533
- For a taco-- - I guess.

726
00:17:36,533 --> 00:17:37,860
- You can get a taco for like two dollars.

727
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,630
Mine probably had to do with the beef, the lobster,

728
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:41,830
but definitely the truffles and the gold leaf,

729
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:42,940
can't forget about the gold leaf.

730
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:43,840
Let's add up all the ingredients

731
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,730
and find out the grand total of my extremely expensive taco.

732
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:48,230
- [Both] Three, two, one.

733
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:50,388
- [Collin] Oh dude, 436 dollars.

734
00:17:50,388 --> 00:17:51,221
- How?

735
00:17:51,221 --> 00:17:53,172
- What? - It tasted so bad.

736
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:54,096
- The guacamole.

737
00:17:54,096 --> 00:17:55,704
- For what? - It was only the guacamole.

738
00:17:55,704 --> 00:17:56,670
You get to comment down below

739
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:58,270
whose taco would you have rather eaten?

740
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,300
And right now, we're on to the next one.

741
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,830
We've got the finished mac and cheeses,

742
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,590
and now it's time to find out which one's expensive,

743
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,423
which one's cheap,

744
00:18:03,423 --> 00:18:04,256
and how they taste.

745
00:18:04,256 --> 00:18:06,630
And, off the bat, the gold leaf looks terrible.

746
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:07,997
Got all kind of crusty on mine.

747
00:18:07,997 --> 00:18:10,640
So, Devan, right now, which one do you think is expensive?

748
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,520
- I think it's mine.

749
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,220
Mine has lobster on it, and it just kind of looks better.

750
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,340
- I'm actually going to say that mine is the expensive one.

751
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,630
I think it's a come from behind victory.

752
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,280
Which one are we going to taste first?

753
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,260
- I think let's do your sad, wilted one.

754
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,120
- Sad wilted one? - Yeah.

755
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,200
- I think this is the expensive one man.

756
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,033
- I think it's cheap.

757
00:18:24,033 --> 00:18:25,780
The cheese has gotten all hard, man.

758
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:26,850
- All right, well you're going for a little,

759
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:27,683
petite bite there.

760
00:18:27,683 --> 00:18:28,670
I'm going for mine.

761
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:29,900
There you go, you want to cheers it?

762
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,733
- Not really.

763
00:18:30,733 --> 00:18:31,566
- Why?

764
00:18:31,566 --> 00:18:32,399
- It's mac and cheese, I don't know.

765
00:18:32,399 --> 00:18:33,232
It's not a drink.

766
00:18:33,232 --> 00:18:35,063
- [Both] Three, two, one.

767
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,210
- Whoa, no way!

768
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:39,043
- What?

769
00:18:39,043 --> 00:18:39,963
- No. - What?

770
00:18:39,963 --> 00:18:41,296
What!

771
00:18:41,296 --> 00:18:43,960
(both cheer and applaud)

772
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,360
The best macaroni and cheese I've ever had.

773
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,300
All right, time to taste yours,

774
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,860
and if this one tastes better than mine, bro,

775
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,200
I will do a back flip right now.

776
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,033
- What?

777
00:18:51,033 --> 00:18:51,866
All right. - I will lose my mind.

778
00:18:51,866 --> 00:18:53,435
- [Both] Here we go, three, two, oh wait.

779
00:18:53,435 --> 00:18:55,250

786
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,270
And let's see how it tastes!

787
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,233
- [Both] Ready, set, go.

788
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:14,078
(both moaning)

789
00:19:14,078 --> 00:19:15,300
- Man!

790
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,140
Dude, that was so bad it tasted like rubber.

791
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:20,490
- Here's the big reveal of the actual price, you ready?

792
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:22,480
- [Both] Three, two, one.

793
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,090
- Yes! - Yep,

794
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:24,923
that made sense.

795
00:19:24,923 --> 00:19:26,810
- From the very beginning, I knew mine was expensive.

796
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:28,047
So how much? - Good job man.

797
00:19:28,047 --> 00:19:29,200
- [Collin] 11 dollars.

798
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,420
- It's not like, super cheap.

799
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,120
- I wonder how much this one costs in total.

800
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,700
Maybe like 50 dollars for this one?

801
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,177
- Yeah, probably. - I mean it's got a whole--

802
00:19:35,177 --> 00:19:36,370
- I don't know, 45? - Maybe, it's got meat,

803
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:37,203
it's got some great cheese, gold leaf.

804
00:19:37,203 --> 00:19:38,450
- [Devan] It's got the gold leaf.

805
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,510
- It's got the noodles. - Gotta be gold.

806
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:40,343
- But the cheese man,

807
00:19:40,343 --> 00:19:41,307
I think the cheese is what really makes it expensive.

808
00:19:41,307 --> 00:19:42,710
All right, let's add all that up together,

809
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:44,060
and the final price is?

810
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,963
- What? - 538 Dollars?

811
00:19:45,963 --> 00:19:48,680
- No way, I mean this has got to be made out of solid gold.

812
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,027
- We've got the $10,000 Starbucks drink,

813
00:19:50,027 --> 00:19:51,960
and it's time to find out who the winner is.

814
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,650
There were three incredible different dishes,

815
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:54,510
and I gotta say Devan,

816
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:55,870
you definitely took the first one.

817
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:56,703
The burger round was all yours.

818
00:19:56,703 --> 00:19:58,780
- [Devan] Thank you, yeah I totally agree.

819
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,474
But, your mac and cheese was phenomenal.

820
00:20:01,474 --> 00:20:02,307
- Thank you. - So, I think you

821
00:20:02,307 --> 00:20:03,140
definitely took that round.

822
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,640
- [Collin] I really think it was all the ingredients,

823
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,771
not my cooking ability.

824
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:06,604
- I don't know, man.

825
00:20:06,604 --> 00:20:07,437
- It was fully the ingredients.

826
00:20:07,437 --> 00:20:08,270
- It was really delicious.

827
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,103
- What it all comes down to,

828
00:20:09,103 --> 00:20:11,230
the tiebreaker is the taco round.

829
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:13,530
- [Devan] I mean, my caviar was pretty bad.

830
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:14,363
- Yeah, but I gotta say,

831
00:20:14,363 --> 00:20:16,670
my guacamole admittedly was not up to standards

832
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:17,503
to where it should be.

833
00:20:17,503 --> 00:20:19,380
So, I gotta say, I think we both fell short

834
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,963
of the mark in terms of preparation, so--

835
00:20:20,963 --> 00:20:21,796
- Yeah, I agree with you.

836
00:20:21,796 --> 00:20:22,629
- How about we call it a draw, Devan?

837
00:20:22,629 --> 00:20:23,462
We'll share the drink.

838
00:20:23,462 --> 00:20:24,357
- All right, that sounds about right.

839
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:25,950
- All right, you get to comment down below.

840
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,320
What is your favorite food you would love

841
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,190
to see us make a cheap and expensive version of,

842
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:30,510
and click over here if you want to see other videos,

843
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,343
is it good?

844
00:20:31,343 --> 00:20:32,180
You have five seconds, here we go.

845
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:34,960
- [Both] Five, four, three,

846
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,330
two, one,

847
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:37,163
done.

848
00:20:37,163 --> 00:20:37,996
Love you, bye!
