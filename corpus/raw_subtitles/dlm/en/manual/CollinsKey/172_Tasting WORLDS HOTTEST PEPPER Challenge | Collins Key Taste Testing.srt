00:00:00,157 --> 00:00:01,504

00:00:01,504 --> 00:00:03,257

00:00:03,257 --> 00:00:04,261
As you guys can tell

00:00:04,261 --> 00:00:06,326
by all this fan mail here behind me today,

5
00:00:06,326 --> 00:00:07,227
I'm gonna open up your fan mail.

6
00:00:07,227 --> 00:00:08,284
Boom, mind blown.

7
00:00:08,284 --> 00:00:10,037
Bet you had no idea that was coming.

8
00:00:10,037 --> 00:00:12,051
I wanna say a huge thank you first of all

9
00:00:12,051 --> 00:00:14,234
to each and every one of you guys who sent in fan mail

10
00:00:14,234 --> 00:00:16,538

11
00:00:16,538 --> 00:00:17,371
it was my birthday.

12
00:00:17,371 --> 00:00:19,313
Eh, turn up, oh, dab.

13
00:00:19,313 --> 00:00:21,415
This is only some of the stuff you guys sent in.

14
00:00:21,415 --> 00:00:23,458
There's a little bit of Christmas stuff I think in here too

15
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:25,437
from my last fan mail vlog that I didn't quite get to,

16
00:00:25,437 --> 00:00:26,511
so I'll be opening up that today.

17
00:00:26,511 --> 00:00:27,643
Also want to let you guys know

18
00:00:27,643 --> 00:00:29,373
that I'm doing a huge giveaway on my channel this month.

19
00:00:29,373 --> 00:00:31,091
I'm giving away a MacBook.

20
00:00:31,091 --> 00:00:32,206
So if you guys want to win that

21
00:00:32,206 --> 00:00:33,553
all you have to do is let me know

22
00:00:33,553 --> 00:00:34,691
by liking this video, (dinging)

23
00:00:34,691 --> 00:00:35,683
comment down below

24
00:00:35,683 --> 00:00:37,645
what is your favorite video that I've ever posted

25
00:00:37,645 --> 00:00:38,748
here on my channel,

26
00:00:38,748 --> 00:00:40,925
and of course you must be subscribed to the channel.

27
00:00:40,925 --> 00:00:42,184
But without any further ado,

28
00:00:42,184 --> 00:00:43,329
let's jump in and let's find out

29
00:00:43,329 --> 00:00:44,320
what's inside this fan mail.

30
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,975
We'll start off right here with this purple box

31
00:00:45,975 --> 00:00:47,287
and I have a knife to open it up.

32
00:00:47,287 --> 00:00:48,297
So this is from Kaylin,

33
00:00:48,297 --> 00:00:50,780
so let's see if I can do this without cutting myself.

34
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:51,613
(knife rubbing)

35
00:00:51,613 --> 00:00:52,778
Screw this I'm going back to scissors.

36
00:00:52,778 --> 00:00:53,620
Alright, here we go.

37
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:57,251
Yo, okay there's this, what are these?

38
00:00:57,251 --> 00:01:00,017
Yo, okay, you know what I know what this is.

39
00:01:00,017 --> 00:01:01,816
This is from when I went out and I visited her.

40
00:01:01,816 --> 00:01:03,552
She was a winner of a one lucky fan visit,

41
00:01:03,552 --> 00:01:04,939
I believe from the StageIt,

42
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:06,361
and at the hotel that we were at,

43
00:01:06,361 --> 00:01:07,876
it was like a hotel casino place,

44
00:01:07,876 --> 00:01:09,066
they had these mints there.

45
00:01:09,066 --> 00:01:10,233
I went wild at the hotel

46
00:01:10,233 --> 00:01:12,127
and I asked for like, if I could get like 50 of 'em,

47
00:01:12,127 --> 00:01:13,229
and they wouldn't give it to me.

48
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:15,597
So now, I have a whole bunch of mints.

49
00:01:15,597 --> 00:01:19,008
I believe this is what, oh yeah, this oh my god thank you.

50
00:01:19,008 --> 00:01:20,525
Keyper's squad, what up, hey?

51
00:01:20,525 --> 00:01:22,185
I'm gonna be snackin' on this the whole time.

52
00:01:22,185 --> 00:01:23,369
This next one here is from Hannah,

53
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:25,035
and I have to say A-plus job.

54
00:01:25,035 --> 00:01:27,770
The design is killer and now let's find out what's inside.

55
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:29,389
So I need my scissors. (box crunching)

56
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:30,753
(surprised grunting)

57
00:01:30,753 --> 00:01:32,059
I almost just cut my pants open.

58
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:33,319
So let's see what we got here.

59
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:35,646
We have a squishy ball, which is a smiley face.

60
00:01:35,646 --> 00:01:36,598
It's like emoji almost.

61
00:01:36,598 --> 00:01:38,677
Check it out, it's like a stress reliever ball.

62
00:01:38,677 --> 00:01:40,066
It's like... (grunting)

63
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:40,922
that's actually really hard.

64
00:01:40,922 --> 00:01:42,484
Is this like for forearm strength or something?

65
00:01:42,484 --> 00:01:44,417
'Cause like wow, I'm really having trouble with that.

66
00:01:44,417 --> 00:01:45,250
Okay, yo straight up right now,

67
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,297
I'm about to take this to the next level.

68
00:01:46,297 --> 00:01:47,130
I'm gonna see if I can take this ball,

69
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:49,165
bounce it off the wall and land it in this box.

70
00:01:49,165 --> 00:01:50,529
Can I get a no way?

71
00:01:50,529 --> 00:01:51,626
That's what I thought.

72
00:01:51,626 --> 00:01:53,804
Alright, here we go.

73
00:01:53,804 --> 00:01:56,171
Oh, did you guys see the oh, I got it in there!

74
00:01:56,171 --> 00:01:57,791
We have a bear right here.

75
00:01:57,791 --> 00:01:58,624
Bam.

76
00:01:58,624 --> 00:02:00,751
Yo, it's like the Keyper bear, it's got a little key,

77
00:02:00,751 --> 00:02:01,854
it's got some wings on it.

78
00:02:01,854 --> 00:02:02,771
That's pretty legit.

79
00:02:02,771 --> 00:02:05,801
And let's see, we have a, this looks like a transformer.

80
00:02:05,801 --> 00:02:08,172
It has a disc shooting thingy.

81
00:02:08,172 --> 00:02:09,859
And I like this thing, alright cool.

82
00:02:09,859 --> 00:02:11,554
I might hit Devon with this later so, shh.

83
00:02:11,554 --> 00:02:13,034
Yo, okay this is Bazooka bubble gum,

84
00:02:13,034 --> 00:02:15,239
and I literally have never had Bazooka bubble gum

85
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:16,072
in my entire life.

86
00:02:16,072 --> 00:02:16,988
Now that it's my birthday,

87
00:02:16,988 --> 00:02:18,618
I'm about to enjoy some Bazooka bubble gum

88
00:02:18,618 --> 00:02:19,547
for the very first time.

89
00:02:19,547 --> 00:02:21,457
We'll go with one, two, three.

90
00:02:21,457 --> 00:02:23,482
My jaw is kind of hurtin' a little bit,

91
00:02:23,482 --> 00:02:24,870
these are really difficult to chew.

92
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,716
This is piece number four.

93
00:02:26,716 --> 00:02:27,842
Piece number five.

94
00:02:27,842 --> 00:02:30,054
Wow, piece number six.

95
00:02:30,054 --> 00:02:31,290
Piece number seven.

96
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,422
Piece number eight.

97
00:02:32,422 --> 00:02:33,867
Piece number nine.

98
00:02:33,867 --> 00:02:37,373
And last, but certainly not least,

99
00:02:37,373 --> 00:02:39,992
we have piece number ten.

100
00:02:39,992 --> 00:02:41,408
I'm gonna need subtitles.

101
00:02:41,408 --> 00:02:43,091
This is a lot of bubble gum.

102
00:02:43,091 --> 00:02:44,868
I'm gonna try to blow a bubble right now,

103
00:02:44,868 --> 00:02:45,924
so let's try this, okay.

104
00:02:45,924 --> 00:02:47,132
Three, two, one.

105
00:02:47,132 --> 00:02:48,978
(gum thumping)

106
00:02:48,978 --> 00:02:51,909
Cool, we've also got this lovely cinnamon candle.

107
00:02:51,909 --> 00:02:53,029
Let's take a breath.

108
00:02:53,029 --> 00:02:53,935
(inhaling deeply)

109
00:02:53,935 --> 00:02:55,848
Oh, that's pretty spicy, yeah.

110
00:02:55,848 --> 00:02:57,069
Also got an assortment of candy,

111
00:02:57,069 --> 00:02:58,463
so yeah, thank you so much Hannah.

112
00:02:58,463 --> 00:03:00,436
And now let's move on to the next one.

113
00:03:00,436 --> 00:03:02,544
This is by far the shiniest one I've received

114
00:03:02,544 --> 00:03:04,152
and this one here is from Jasmine.

115
00:03:04,152 --> 00:03:05,684
So, we're gonna open this up. (tearing)

116
00:03:05,684 --> 00:03:06,572
Yo, this is so cool.

117
00:03:06,572 --> 00:03:07,652
Not only do we have this picture,

118
00:03:07,652 --> 00:03:09,527
but we also have this picture right here.

119
00:03:09,527 --> 00:03:10,995
So yeah, thank you so much Jasmine.

120
00:03:10,995 --> 00:03:12,389
Like I love these, these are really pretty.

121
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:15,721
Oh, and then can't forget that there's actually a ton of,

122
00:03:15,721 --> 00:03:17,439
is this either just one long cord,

123
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:19,459
or is this, yo, this like, yo ho ho ho!

124
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:20,971
Alright we talking now.

125
00:03:20,971 --> 00:03:22,123
Whoo!

126
00:03:22,123 --> 00:03:23,082
I think it's kind of like a scarf,

127
00:03:23,082 --> 00:03:24,065
like you kind of take it like this

128
00:03:24,065 --> 00:03:25,495
and you just kind of give it a flick over your neck.

129
00:03:25,495 --> 00:03:26,328
How's it look guys?

130
00:03:26,328 --> 00:03:28,346
Rapper, two chains, what it is boy.

131
00:03:28,346 --> 00:03:29,179
Boom.

132
00:03:29,179 --> 00:03:30,836
Alright, so let's see what inside this one.

133
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:32,136
We've got some wrapping paper.

134
00:03:32,136 --> 00:03:33,756
Thank you, yay!

135
00:03:33,756 --> 00:03:34,589
Bam!

136
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:35,561
Bam! (laughing)

137
00:03:35,561 --> 00:03:37,796
Collins Key, we got a nice key, so thank you Carla.

138
00:03:37,796 --> 00:03:39,729
Next we got a Webkinz, bringing it back,

139
00:03:39,729 --> 00:03:41,796
and this one is a little frog I believe.

140
00:03:41,796 --> 00:03:43,932
But it's like a pink Valentine's Day lookin' frog,

141
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,987
so I'll use this as a clip on my necklace.

142
00:03:45,987 --> 00:03:47,072
Bam!

143
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,675
That's what you call bling right there kids.

144
00:03:48,675 --> 00:03:49,508
Better get it right.

145
00:03:49,508 --> 00:03:51,240
Then we have also again just have an assortment of candy.

146
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,168
We have gum right here, don't choke.

147
00:03:53,168 --> 00:03:54,497
I'm not sure what that means.

148
00:03:54,497 --> 00:03:56,540
I'm gonna try to blow a bubble right now,

149
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,305
three, two, one. (gum thumping)

150
00:03:58,305 --> 00:03:59,715
You should be in the psychic business

151
00:03:59,715 --> 00:04:01,207
because that is pretty incredible.

152
00:04:01,207 --> 00:04:04,232
So we have this, we've got some Fruit Snacks right here.

153
00:04:04,232 --> 00:04:07,709
We've also got Strawberry Twizzlers.

154
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:08,742
This is a lot of candy.

155
00:04:08,742 --> 00:04:10,228
Can't let my family know that I have this,

156
00:04:10,228 --> 00:04:11,854
otherwise it'll all be gone by like morning.

157
00:04:11,854 --> 00:04:13,543
So yeah, thank you so much Carla, I love it.

158
00:04:13,543 --> 00:04:15,284
This next one here is from Catherine,

159
00:04:15,284 --> 00:04:16,661
and this actually from Singapore,

160
00:04:16,661 --> 00:04:18,001
so I'm really excited to find out what's inside.

161
00:04:18,001 --> 00:04:19,245
Alright, let's see we'll open this up.

162
00:04:19,245 --> 00:04:20,079
(paper tearing)

163
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:20,912
Ooh!

164
00:04:21,904 --> 00:04:22,807
Another package.

165
00:04:22,807 --> 00:04:24,351
Hey we found, are you eating a cookie?

166
00:04:24,351 --> 00:04:25,344
- Yeah. - Where are they?

167
00:04:25,344 --> 00:04:26,177
- Huh? - Did mom make 'em?

168
00:04:26,177 --> 00:04:27,010
- Yeah. - What?

169
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:27,843
Okay. - Yup.

170
00:04:27,843 --> 00:04:30,029
- Let's see what we got inside, we have...

171
00:04:30,029 --> 00:04:30,862
- Ooh.

172
00:04:30,862 --> 00:04:31,880
- Batman!

173
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,034
- It's like a pencil or a pen case I think.

174
00:04:34,034 --> 00:04:36,067
- Yes, awesome. - That's cool.

175
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,870
- Yo, I think this one was like,

176
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,554
yeah this is one of those iPhone lenses.

177
00:04:39,554 --> 00:04:41,590
- Oh, wait, what? - Yes!

178
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:42,636
- No way!

179
00:04:42,636 --> 00:04:44,232
- Yo, the game has been changed.

180
00:04:44,232 --> 00:04:45,266
Even though it's my birthday,

181
00:04:45,266 --> 00:04:47,193
I'm gonna be kind and I'm gonna give this to you.

182
00:04:47,193 --> 00:04:48,754
(excited yelling)

183
00:04:48,754 --> 00:04:50,461
Devon's birthday was actually last month, so yeah...

184
00:04:50,461 --> 00:04:51,294
- Yeah

185
00:04:51,294 --> 00:04:52,933
- happy birthday bro, thanks for being in the video.

186
00:04:52,933 --> 00:04:53,766
- Thank you, happy birthday too.

187
00:04:53,766 --> 00:04:54,994
- Absolutely, I like Devon's hair.

188
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:57,014
(laughing)

189
00:04:57,014 --> 00:04:57,847
- And I'm out.

190
00:04:57,847 --> 00:04:59,185
(laughing)

191
00:04:59,185 --> 00:05:00,677
- Okay, so this is from Urban Outfitters.

192
00:05:00,677 --> 00:05:02,662
So either, Urban Outfitters is legit

193
00:05:02,662 --> 00:05:03,597
and sending me something

194
00:05:03,597 --> 00:05:05,263
or you guys are even more legit and sending me something.

195
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,540
So let's see if I can.

196
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,881
Ingeniousness. (box tearing)

197
00:05:08,881 --> 00:05:09,864
Bam!

198
00:05:09,864 --> 00:05:11,329
Boxes don't matter to me.

199
00:05:11,329 --> 00:05:13,819
Paper, yay!

200
00:05:13,819 --> 00:05:15,154
Fisheye phone, yo!

201
00:05:15,154 --> 00:05:17,534
Yeah it's like a gold fisheye lens.

202
00:05:17,534 --> 00:05:19,943
So the only name I'm seeing on here is Cassie.

203
00:05:19,943 --> 00:05:21,116
So yeah, Cassie!

204
00:05:21,116 --> 00:05:23,920
Thank you so much, 'cause this is freaking awesome!

205
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,988
So yeah, thank you!

206
00:05:24,988 --> 00:05:25,975
You guys, straight up,

207
00:05:25,975 --> 00:05:28,633
my gram is about to be popping off to another level now.

208
00:05:28,633 --> 00:05:30,055
So yeah, you all better watch out.

209
00:05:30,055 --> 00:05:31,646
Next we are going for the envelope

210
00:05:31,646 --> 00:05:33,446
with the macaroni and cheese duct tape.

211
00:05:33,446 --> 00:05:34,496
That's definitely a new one.

212
00:05:34,496 --> 00:05:35,593
So let's see what we got in here.

213
00:05:35,593 --> 00:05:37,712
You guys got me some legit, I believe this is tape.

214
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,906
But it says like bam, we have donuts

215
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:41,625
and then we also have mustaches.

216
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,575
So you guys just gave me some of the most legit tape

217
00:05:43,575 --> 00:05:44,841
I have ever seen in my entire life.

218
00:05:44,841 --> 00:05:46,344
And I've gotta say it's pretty fitting,

219
00:05:46,344 --> 00:05:47,731
when you have macaroni and cheese duct tape

220
00:05:47,731 --> 00:05:48,620
on your envelope.

221
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,628
This next one here is coming from Australia,

222
00:05:50,628 --> 00:05:51,957
and there's no name on the outside,

223
00:05:51,957 --> 00:05:53,946
so hopefully I'll find the name on the inside.

224
00:05:53,946 --> 00:05:55,949
Shout out, (paper tearing)

225
00:05:55,949 --> 00:05:57,373
for the little tear thing right there.

226
00:05:57,373 --> 00:05:58,238
Yo!

227
00:05:58,238 --> 00:06:00,084
This is huge, this is a,

228
00:06:00,084 --> 00:06:01,797
okay I've never even heard of a Violet Crumble,

229
00:06:01,797 --> 00:06:03,044
but maybe it's like an Australian thing.

230
00:06:03,044 --> 00:06:04,269
But yeah, this is pretty legit.

231
00:06:04,269 --> 00:06:05,865
We also got some other candy in here.

232
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:06,724
(deep inhaling)

233
00:06:06,724 --> 00:06:07,557
Lifesavers.

234
00:06:07,557 --> 00:06:08,500
A Wagon Wheel.

235
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,132
Yeah we definitely, I don't think we have these in America.

236
00:06:10,132 --> 00:06:11,885
And then we also have Caramel Koala right here.

237
00:06:11,885 --> 00:06:14,067
So that's definitely Australian right there.

238
00:06:14,067 --> 00:06:14,900
This is super awesome,

239
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,948
so Amy thank you so much

240
00:06:15,948 --> 00:06:17,649
for all of this really cool Australian candy.

241
00:06:17,649 --> 00:06:19,501
This next one here is a rather small package

242
00:06:19,501 --> 00:06:21,579
but you must not judge a package by it's size.

243
00:06:21,579 --> 00:06:23,605
We're gonna see what's inside this one here.

244
00:06:23,605 --> 00:06:25,855
Let's see, we open this up.

245
00:06:27,548 --> 00:06:30,048
Not exactly sure what this is.

246
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,263
This is a Carolina pepper, world's hottest pepper.

247
00:06:34,263 --> 00:06:35,662
Please take a bite on camera.

248
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:36,495
And there's nothing else.

249
00:06:36,495 --> 00:06:38,939
Just like a couple oil stains.

250
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:41,089
(heavy sighing)

251
00:06:41,089 --> 00:06:44,787
Alright Ryan, you challenged me, so here we go.

252
00:06:44,787 --> 00:06:47,028
If I die, Ryan this is on you,

253
00:06:47,028 --> 00:06:49,257
because I don't do well with spicy things.

254
00:06:49,257 --> 00:06:50,640
So let's see, I'm gonna use a tissue,

255
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,774
'cause I don't even want it to get on my fingers.

256
00:06:52,774 --> 00:06:53,607
Let's see.

257
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,095
Oh, that's a big one.

258
00:06:56,095 --> 00:06:57,441
Alright guys, here we go.

259
00:06:57,441 --> 00:06:58,274
Three.

260
00:06:58,274 --> 00:06:59,107
Two.

261
00:06:59,107 --> 00:06:59,940
One.

262
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,766
(dramatic orchestra music)

263
00:07:01,766 --> 00:07:03,391
Y'all must think I am crazy,

264
00:07:03,391 --> 00:07:05,081
if you really think that I'm gonna be eating one,

265
00:07:05,081 --> 00:07:06,248
no I am not eating a pepper.

266
00:07:06,248 --> 00:07:07,687
No, I am not eating the world's hottest pepper.

267
00:07:07,687 --> 00:07:08,924
Guys, I wanna live.

268
00:07:08,924 --> 00:07:11,275
I am sorry Ryan, challenge is not accepted.

269
00:07:11,275 --> 00:07:13,179
I will literally die if I ate one of those peppers.

270
00:07:13,179 --> 00:07:14,427
So yeah, let's go to the next one.

271
00:07:14,427 --> 00:07:15,866
And this on here is from Jessica.

272
00:07:15,866 --> 00:07:17,910
Alright, so let's find out what's inside.

273
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:20,058
And you know what, this one here is also from Singapore.

274
00:07:20,058 --> 00:07:21,242
So yo, shout out to Singapore,

275
00:07:21,242 --> 00:07:23,018
you guys are representin' so far.

276
00:07:23,018 --> 00:07:23,851
So let's see.

277
00:07:23,851 --> 00:07:24,852
What are these?

278
00:07:24,852 --> 00:07:27,029
We got some potato chips.

279
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,515
Barbecue flour, Jack 'N Jill.

280
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:30,527
So that must be like a Singapore brand,

281
00:07:30,527 --> 00:07:31,923
'cause I have not heard of Jack 'N Jills.

282
00:07:31,923 --> 00:07:32,972
So we've got Jack 'N Jill.

283
00:07:32,972 --> 00:07:33,805
It looks like we've got

284
00:07:33,805 --> 00:07:35,172
a whole bunch of candy from Singapore.

285
00:07:35,172 --> 00:07:36,152
Sesame Street, is that Sesame Street.

286
00:07:36,152 --> 00:07:37,366
Wait, wait, wait, hold up.

287
00:07:37,366 --> 00:07:39,223
'cause I think that this is Cookie Monster.

288
00:07:39,223 --> 00:07:40,460
Is this Cookie Monster?

289
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,644
No, it's just monster.

290
00:07:41,644 --> 00:07:43,171
It looks literally like Cookie Monster

291
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,580
and he's selling a cookie, but it's not Cookie Monster.

292
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,413
What?

293
00:07:46,413 --> 00:07:47,275
You got Yeppies.

294
00:07:47,275 --> 00:07:48,329
You got a Hello Kitty on the side of this,

295
00:07:48,329 --> 00:07:49,266
so I know Hello Kitty.

296
00:07:49,266 --> 00:07:50,583
We got the Tinker lollipop.

297
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,092
Yeah, we also got some other candy as well.

298
00:07:52,092 --> 00:07:53,015
See, actually you know what,

299
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:53,956
I was thinking for another video,

300
00:07:53,956 --> 00:07:54,797
I might taste some candy

301
00:07:54,797 --> 00:07:56,097
from somewhere else around the world.

302
00:07:56,097 --> 00:07:57,351
So let me know if you guys want me to do that

303
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:59,316
by liking this video and comment down below

304
00:07:59,316 --> 00:08:01,960
what part of the world should I taste candy from.

305
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,987
This one's got leopard print on it

306
00:08:02,987 --> 00:08:04,183
so it kind of caught my attention.

307
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:05,361
And I'm not sure where this is from,

308
00:08:05,361 --> 00:08:06,230
I'm not sure who it's from.

309
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,381
I'm sure we'll find out inside.

310
00:08:07,381 --> 00:08:09,088
But, yeah let's do it.

311
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:10,533
Alright, so we got some newspapers.

312
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:12,275
I'm like, low-key more excited about the fact

313
00:08:12,275 --> 00:08:14,115
that these newspapers are in another language,

314
00:08:14,115 --> 00:08:15,249
and I don't even know what's inside of here yet.

315
00:08:15,249 --> 00:08:16,082
So let's see.

316
00:08:16,082 --> 00:08:17,098
Alright we have a little card here.

317
00:08:17,098 --> 00:08:18,625
So hopefully we can use our detective skills

318
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:19,867
and find out who this is from.

319
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:21,110
So this whole thing here is from Marin,

320
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,021
and this is awesome.

321
00:08:22,021 --> 00:08:23,025
This actually from Norway.

322
00:08:23,025 --> 00:08:24,349
So let's see what we got inside.

323
00:08:24,349 --> 00:08:26,172
Alright so the first candy here is called Smash

324
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,499
and it's salty and air crispy, corn cones,

325
00:08:28,499 --> 00:08:29,724
covered in milk chocolate.

326
00:08:29,724 --> 00:08:30,557
That's tongue twister.

327
00:08:30,557 --> 00:08:32,562
Yo, this is huge!

328
00:08:32,562 --> 00:08:34,525
This chocolate bar is bigger than my head.

329
00:08:34,525 --> 00:08:36,133
This is quite a lot of candy from Norway.

330
00:08:36,133 --> 00:08:38,652
So you know, I think the time is coming very shortly

331
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:40,730
where I'm gonna be taste testing a lot of candies

332
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,605
from all around the world, so stay tuned for that.

333
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,434
This package here is from Rhiannon.

334
00:08:44,434 --> 00:08:46,373
So let's find out what is inside.

335
00:08:46,373 --> 00:08:48,659
That was a solid scissor slice right there.

336
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:50,604
Yo, straight up, this is super legit.

337
00:08:50,604 --> 00:08:52,090
It's like a box.

338
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:53,524
This appears to be handmade,

339
00:08:53,524 --> 00:08:55,556
like the paint has literally even dried this thing together.

340
00:08:55,556 --> 00:08:57,709
So let's see if I can, carefully get it open.

341
00:08:57,709 --> 00:08:59,724
Yo, I've been seeking for the right prom date,

342
00:08:59,724 --> 00:09:00,844
will you go to prom with me?

343
00:09:00,844 --> 00:09:03,230
This is, I gotta admit, this is pretty legit right here.

344
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:04,507
This next on here is from Sienna,

345
00:09:04,507 --> 00:09:05,952
and the envelope or whatever

346
00:09:05,952 --> 00:09:07,549
is like around the actual package itself

347
00:09:07,549 --> 00:09:08,983
is a little bit confusing to me.

348
00:09:08,983 --> 00:09:10,405
Yeah I can't get this open on my own.

349
00:09:10,405 --> 00:09:11,827
Okay, scissor time, let's do it.

350
00:09:11,827 --> 00:09:14,114
Oh my god, Sienna, there's a picture of her right there.

351
00:09:14,114 --> 00:09:15,461
I don't know if you guys can see it,

352
00:09:15,461 --> 00:09:17,498
but like, she's like, the picture just flew off.

353
00:09:17,498 --> 00:09:19,658
Alright perfect, let's find out what's inside the box.

354
00:09:19,658 --> 00:09:23,025
First of all Sienna got me covered with some blue shades.

355
00:09:23,025 --> 00:09:24,778
Eh, stunna'!

356
00:09:24,778 --> 00:09:27,651
And then we also got, let's see, a magic carpet I believe.

357
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:28,882
It looks like a little magic carpet,

358
00:09:28,882 --> 00:09:30,148
like a little magic rug.

359
00:09:30,148 --> 00:09:33,033
And then we've also of course got a dope deck of cards.

360
00:09:33,033 --> 00:09:34,298
Y'all ready for this.

361
00:09:34,298 --> 00:09:36,992
Oh snap, that did not just happen.

362
00:09:36,992 --> 00:09:38,948
Yo, straight up, this is so legit.

363
00:09:38,948 --> 00:09:40,800
Sienna got me an Etch-A-Sketch.

364
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,628
If y'all remember what Etch-A-Sketch's are.

365
00:09:42,628 --> 00:09:45,897
Oh my god, this used to be my jam, my childhood jam.

366
00:09:45,897 --> 00:09:46,730
Oh my god.

367
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:48,010
Get funky with it, oh, oh, oh!

368
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:49,200
Thank you so much Sienna.

369
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,587
Alright this one here is from Niley,

370
00:09:50,587 --> 00:09:52,775
and I gotta say, overall, pound for pound,

371
00:09:52,775 --> 00:09:54,917
that's quite a bit of decoration just for one envelope.

372
00:09:54,917 --> 00:09:55,750
So thank you.

373
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,729
Yo, this is crazy!

374
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:59,672
There's like a whole bunch of mini cards, eh!

375
00:09:59,672 --> 00:10:01,982
Mini cards for days!

376
00:10:01,982 --> 00:10:02,922
Alright yo, check it out, right here,

377
00:10:02,922 --> 00:10:04,066
we got one, two, three.

378
00:10:04,066 --> 00:10:06,754
Oh snap, that did not just happen!

379
00:10:06,754 --> 00:10:08,457
This one here is from Alyssa, and I gotta say,

380
00:10:08,457 --> 00:10:09,372
(paper rattling)

381
00:10:09,372 --> 00:10:12,007
there's definitely something like shakeable inside of this,

382
00:10:12,007 --> 00:10:13,023
so let's see what it is.

383
00:10:13,023 --> 00:10:17,322
Yo, this is awesome, can you guys see it?

384
00:10:17,322 --> 00:10:19,629
This is so crazy, thank you so much.

385
00:10:19,629 --> 00:10:21,525
And now to find out, (box rattling)

386
00:10:21,525 --> 00:10:22,358
what's shakin'?

387
00:10:22,358 --> 00:10:23,367
Alright let's see.

388
00:10:23,367 --> 00:10:25,422
So first of all we got some Silly String.

389
00:10:25,422 --> 00:10:26,351
Don't tell Devon.

390
00:10:26,351 --> 00:10:28,127
And then we have a Glow Stick.

391
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:28,963
Heck yes!

392
00:10:28,963 --> 00:10:30,188
And then we've also got Nerds,

393
00:10:30,188 --> 00:10:31,529
which I've never actually had Nerds before.

394
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:33,050
I've heard from multiple people though,

395
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,041
that Nerds are like the best candy so let's see.

396
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:35,981
Take a little handful,

397
00:10:35,981 --> 00:10:37,299
not too much, keep it tasteful.

398
00:10:37,299 --> 00:10:39,725
(agreeable grunt) Yeah, these are actually, yeah, wow,

399
00:10:39,725 --> 00:10:40,558
these are rather tasty, yeah.

400
00:10:40,558 --> 00:10:42,047
Thank you so much Alyssa.

401
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,853
Alright this one here is from Alexa so,

402
00:10:43,853 --> 00:10:45,048
that was supposed to be a very dramatic tear

403
00:10:45,048 --> 00:10:45,884
but that did not work at all.

404
00:10:45,884 --> 00:10:47,905
So yeah let's find out what's in..

405
00:10:47,905 --> 00:10:49,257
(laughing)

406
00:10:49,257 --> 00:10:50,737
I'm terrible at opening up this stuff

407
00:10:50,737 --> 00:10:52,653
so I'm just gonna kind of magician time,

408
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:54,417
cover up the rip that may or may not

409
00:10:54,417 --> 00:10:55,753
have been created in the paper.

410
00:10:55,753 --> 00:10:57,268
And these are awesome, these are really cool.

411
00:10:57,268 --> 00:10:58,301
Thank you so much.

412
00:10:58,301 --> 00:10:59,595
We're going up to the next one right now

413
00:10:59,595 --> 00:11:01,743
and this here doesn't have a name on the outside.

414
00:11:01,743 --> 00:11:03,455
But we are about to find out who it's...

415
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:05,754
I can not open this stuff at all.

416
00:11:05,754 --> 00:11:07,136
It's a shirt.

417
00:11:07,136 --> 00:11:08,616
I think it says something.

418
00:11:08,616 --> 00:11:10,648
I never got my acceptance letter for Hogwarts,

419
00:11:10,648 --> 00:11:13,411
so I'm leaving the Shire and becoming a Jedi.

420
00:11:13,411 --> 00:11:15,239
Yo, this is straight up, okay, yeah I'm,

421
00:11:15,239 --> 00:11:16,708
this is new favorite shirt right here.

422
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,049
I'm definitely gonna be wearing this shirt.

423
00:11:18,049 --> 00:11:18,882
Thank you so much,

424
00:11:18,882 --> 00:11:20,539
and there is no name like anywhere to be found,

425
00:11:20,539 --> 00:11:22,333
so if you sent me this, you know who you are

426
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:23,709
and thank you so very much.

427
00:11:23,709 --> 00:11:24,591
So this here says,

428
00:11:24,591 --> 00:11:26,576
"Will you please put this in your Youtube video."

429
00:11:26,576 --> 00:11:28,033
And you know what, I've gotta obey,

430
00:11:28,033 --> 00:11:29,943
so this one here, this is goin' in the Youtube video,

431
00:11:29,943 --> 00:11:30,776
so let's see.

432
00:11:30,776 --> 00:11:31,842
Opening up here.

433
00:11:31,842 --> 00:11:32,753
Yo, this is awesome,

434
00:11:32,753 --> 00:11:34,669
it's literally my face on playing cards.

435
00:11:34,669 --> 00:11:37,217
Alright guys, we are getting down to the last few right now.

436
00:11:37,217 --> 00:11:40,154
So next, I think I'm gonna hit it with this box over here,

437
00:11:40,154 --> 00:11:42,221
'cause it's pretty colorful, and yeah let's do it.

438
00:11:42,221 --> 00:11:43,806
I challenge like all of you guys

439
00:11:43,806 --> 00:11:45,628

440
00:11:45,628 --> 00:11:46,650
So yeah, thank you guys.

441
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:48,055
I gotta say, even through the mail

442
00:11:48,055 --> 00:11:49,744
the presentation on this is on point

443
00:11:49,744 --> 00:11:51,085
'cause there's like this little chocolate

444
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,159
just sitting right on top.

445
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:54,011
So I don't know if you could have planned that any better.

446
00:11:54,011 --> 00:11:55,473
Alright so we've got a few more chocolates

447
00:11:55,473 --> 00:11:56,803
and we are unrolling this thing.

448
00:11:56,803 --> 00:11:57,888
This is a, I don't know if you guys can see,

449
00:11:57,888 --> 00:11:59,212
this is a lot of bubble wrap.

450
00:11:59,212 --> 00:12:01,313
Alright, so let's see, this like Webkinz squirrel,

451
00:12:01,313 --> 00:12:04,500
this is kind of like the epitome of having a Webkinz.

452
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,654
So yeah, this is my new best friend right here.

453
00:12:06,654 --> 00:12:07,960
Thank you so much, Samantha.

454
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,848
This guy's like super cute.

455
00:12:08,848 --> 00:12:10,833
You know what, I might even like low-key log him in

456
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,133
and like just be playing on Webkinz.

457
00:12:12,133 --> 00:12:12,966
You guys never know.

458
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:14,502
Alright, so again this one doesn't have a name

459
00:12:14,502 --> 00:12:15,335
on the outside,

460
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:17,346
hopefully there's a name here on the inside.

461
00:12:17,346 --> 00:12:18,368
Whoa, okay!

462
00:12:18,368 --> 00:12:19,801
Good job, 'cause whoever sent me this,

463
00:12:19,801 --> 00:12:21,479
you scared me really bad just now.

464
00:12:21,479 --> 00:12:23,337
Like I literally freaked out.

465
00:12:23,337 --> 00:12:25,862
Well this is from Sadie, I believe she lives in London,

466
00:12:25,862 --> 00:12:27,783
and yeah, she sent me this is super cool.

467
00:12:27,783 --> 00:12:29,705
She sent me some like London coins as well.

468
00:12:29,705 --> 00:12:31,227
This one here kind of looks like a penny,

469
00:12:31,227 --> 00:12:32,531
but it has the Queen's face on there.

470
00:12:32,531 --> 00:12:33,727
I'm gonna try to spend these in America

471
00:12:33,727 --> 00:12:34,580
and just kind of like see what happens.

472
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,799
I'll probably do it on my SnapChat.

473
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:36,728
So, if you guys wanna see that

474
00:12:36,728 --> 00:12:37,860
you might as well add my SnapChat.

475
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,923
My name is CollinsKey.

476
00:12:38,923 --> 00:12:39,756
But yeah,

477
00:12:39,756 --> 00:12:40,762
you guys can also use the scan code right over there.

478
00:12:40,762 --> 00:12:41,804
Thank you so much Sadie.

479
00:12:41,804 --> 00:12:43,534
We got a whole bunch of mustaches.

480
00:12:43,534 --> 00:12:44,376
Yes!

481
00:12:44,376 --> 00:12:45,572
Alright cool, and let's see.

482
00:12:45,572 --> 00:12:47,516
We've also got some money glasses.

483
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:49,629
This is for whenever you guys go to like a family gathering

484
00:12:49,629 --> 00:12:51,481
and people are like, "Oh, so how much money do you make?"

485
00:12:51,481 --> 00:12:54,163
Just take these glasses, put 'em on,

486
00:12:54,163 --> 00:12:55,446
and then just walk away.

487
00:12:55,446 --> 00:12:56,362
This is pretty awesome right here.

488
00:12:56,362 --> 00:12:57,547
Thank you very much Kaylyn.

489
00:12:57,547 --> 00:12:59,248
Alright we are now down to the last two.

490
00:12:59,248 --> 00:13:01,169
So we got this huge box, it says fragile,

491
00:13:01,169 --> 00:13:02,052
please handle with care.

492
00:13:02,052 --> 00:13:03,387
So I will not spin the box around.

493
00:13:03,387 --> 00:13:05,546
Alright, so to start off with, there is bubble wrap.

494
00:13:05,546 --> 00:13:06,899
Oh there's another layer of bubble wrap.

495
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:08,548
There's actually a lot of bubble wrap.

496
00:13:08,548 --> 00:13:09,552
This is heavy!

497
00:13:09,552 --> 00:13:11,073
Yo, we got all the goodies.

498
00:13:11,073 --> 00:13:13,017
We first, we got a rock, some Silly String,

499
00:13:13,017 --> 00:13:15,899
classic Coca-Cola bottle, another rock.

500
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:17,098
Maybe it's like a coaster.

501
00:13:17,098 --> 00:13:18,898
Yo, and then last but not least, check it out,

502
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:21,545
it's like an outline of me, but like on this legit canvas.

503
00:13:21,545 --> 00:13:22,378
This is so cool.

504
00:13:22,378 --> 00:13:24,157
Thank you so much Simon.

505
00:13:24,157 --> 00:13:26,543
Hey guys, this thing is massive.

506
00:13:26,543 --> 00:13:28,737
So I really have no idea what's inside,

507
00:13:28,737 --> 00:13:32,249
but yeah, right now my head barely like fits above it.

508
00:13:32,249 --> 00:13:33,735
Let's find out what is inside.

509
00:13:33,735 --> 00:13:36,841
I'm really having, if you guys can tell this thing is huge.

510
00:13:36,841 --> 00:13:38,057
Yo!

511
00:13:38,057 --> 00:13:40,864
(box crashing)

512
00:13:40,864 --> 00:13:41,697
It says, "Stop,

513
00:13:41,697 --> 00:13:43,812
"must have Devon with you while opening this."

514
00:13:43,812 --> 00:13:44,645
Hey Devon!

515
00:13:44,645 --> 00:13:45,513
Devon's back! - Hey!

516
00:13:45,513 --> 00:13:46,738

This is absolutely insane.

526
00:14:01,452 --> 00:14:02,285

527
00:14:02,285 --> 00:14:03,118

there are new videos coming out

536
00:14:13,778 --> 00:14:15,099
each and every single Thursday.

537
00:14:15,099 --> 00:14:16,213
Thank you Devon for being here.

538
00:14:16,213 --> 00:14:17,297
- Yeah of course.

539
00:14:17,297 --> 00:14:18,285
Happy birthday by the way.

540
00:14:18,285 --> 00:14:20,067
- Thank you very much, I appreciate it.

541
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:20,900
- Yeah.

542
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,325
- And also I wanna let you guys know one more thing,

543
00:14:22,325 --> 00:14:23,158
and I'm super excited,

544
00:14:23,158 --> 00:14:25,164
but this year I'm apart of AT&T Hello Lab.

545
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:27,282
So basically I've got like a brand new show

546
00:14:27,282 --> 00:14:29,088
that's gonna be coming out here on my Youtube channel.

547
00:14:29,088 --> 00:14:30,017
I can't tell you guys - No way.

548
00:14:30,017 --> 00:14:30,850
- what it is.

549
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:32,263
Like I gotta be super secret with it.

550
00:14:32,263 --> 00:14:33,900
But in the meantime I've been binge-watching a ton

551
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,711
of the other Hello Labber's shows.

552
00:14:35,711 --> 00:14:38,677
One of whom is Grace Helbig and it is freaking awesome.

553
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:40,622
She has a show called Writing with Grace

554
00:14:40,622 --> 00:14:41,701
and it is absolutely crazy.

555
00:14:41,701 --> 00:14:43,867
It's a love story, but there's flying cats and dogs,

556
00:14:43,867 --> 00:14:45,074
there's a crazy group chat,

557
00:14:45,074 --> 00:14:46,659
and I believe there's no gravity as well.

558
00:14:46,659 --> 00:14:48,528
Like the whole thing is just completely out of control.

559
00:14:48,528 --> 00:14:49,381
(laughing)

560
00:14:49,381 --> 00:14:50,746
So this week I challenge you guys

561
00:14:50,746 --> 00:14:52,023
and maybe even challenge myself

562
00:14:52,023 --> 00:14:53,782
to write a chapter for Grace's novella.

563
00:14:53,782 --> 00:14:54,734
And the best part of this

564
00:14:54,734 --> 00:14:56,191
is that Grace is gonna be reading her novella

565
00:14:56,191 --> 00:14:57,613
onstage at VidCon.

566
00:14:57,613 --> 00:14:59,262
So make sure you guys check out her videos.

567
00:14:59,262 --> 00:15:00,922
You guys can binge watch on it as well,

568
00:15:00,922 --> 00:15:03,000
and also make sure you guys go write that chapter.

569
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,595
In the meantime, I will see you guys again, next Thursday.

570
00:15:05,595 --> 00:15:07,232
I love you all so much, thank you!

571
00:15:07,232 --> 00:15:08,065
- [Devon] Yeah!

572
00:15:08,065 --> 00:15:10,454
- For all of this incredible, incredible birthday fan mail.

573
00:15:10,454 --> 00:15:13,043
You guys are simply the best, love you so much,

574
00:15:13,043 --> 00:15:14,836
see you again soon, bye.

575
00:15:14,836 --> 00:15:16,418
