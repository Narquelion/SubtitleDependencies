1
00:00:00,303 --> 00:00:01,136
- [Collins] You challenged us to make

2
00:00:01,136 --> 00:00:03,267
Iron Man out of a watermelon, so let's go!

3
00:00:03,267 --> 00:00:04,355
- [Devan] Time to peel the melon.

4
00:00:04,355 --> 00:00:05,480
- And I've got the spatula peeler, so here we go.

5
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06,313
It's gonna peel it off like this.

6
00:00:06,313 --> 00:00:07,851
You always wanna peel away from yourself like this!

7
00:00:07,851 --> 00:00:09,272
(energetic yell)

8
00:00:09,272 --> 00:00:10,105
I got it!

9
00:00:10,105 --> 00:00:10,938
- What?

10
00:00:10,938 --> 00:00:11,957
- I got the melon, bro!

11
00:00:11,957 --> 00:00:13,641
It's dripping a little bit, you know, but here we go.

12
00:00:13,641 --> 00:00:15,050
Just gonna try to gut my melon out, 'cause Devon,

13
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:16,124
I have a completely different process

14
00:00:16,124 --> 00:00:16,982
than what you're doing--

15
00:00:16,982 --> 00:00:17,815
- Oh!

16
00:00:17,815 --> 00:00:19,167
It's going over the edge! It's going over the edge!

17
00:00:19,167 --> 00:00:20,926
- [Devan] I've peeled the entire melon,

18
00:00:20,926 --> 00:00:22,625
now I'm gonna chop off the bottom,

19
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:23,824
so I have a sturdy base.

20
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:24,753
Ta-da!

21
00:00:24,753 --> 00:00:25,766
- It's all peeled and now it's time

22
00:00:25,766 --> 00:00:26,687
to shape the head.

23
00:00:26,687 --> 00:00:28,118
This is what I'm gonna use for Iron Man's mask,

24
00:00:28,118 --> 00:00:29,320
so here we go, we're gonna place it down,

25
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,424
as you can see, through my perfect art skills,

26
00:00:31,424 --> 00:00:33,734
it literally has the eye holes already right there.

27
00:00:33,734 --> 00:00:35,236
So next up, I'm just going to accentuate those,

28
00:00:35,236 --> 00:00:36,150
you know, bring out his eyes.

29
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:36,983
- You want to make sure you

30
00:00:36,983 --> 00:00:38,749
shave it down very gradually,

31
00:00:38,749 --> 00:00:40,443
because you don't want to lose too much of the red.

32
00:00:40,443 --> 00:00:42,411
See, dude, I can look through the mask, bro!

33
00:00:42,411 --> 00:00:43,410
I'm becoming Iron Man!

34
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,843
Right now I'm scoring the side of it

35
00:00:44,843 --> 00:00:46,556
so I know where to stop cutting.

36
00:00:46,556 --> 00:00:48,119
Now it's time to start shaping the head.

37
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:49,264
And I'm gonna be very careful,

38
00:00:49,264 --> 00:00:51,868
do not try this at home, but I'm gonna be shaving off

39
00:00:51,868 --> 00:00:53,378
a whole bunch of watermelon here, so here we go.

40
00:00:53,378 --> 00:00:54,659
You made it look so easy when you were doin' it, man,

41
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:56,531
but this is, I gotta say Devan, not quite as easy

42
00:00:56,531 --> 00:00:57,364
as you made it look.

43
00:00:57,364 --> 00:00:58,878
And done, there we go!

44
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:00,230
- [Devan] Look at that, dude!

45
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,999
- Yo, that actually looks really good, bro!

46
00:01:01,999 --> 00:01:03,478
I got it fully peeled and now it's time

47
00:01:03,478 --> 00:01:04,624
to fasten Iron Man's face to this,

48
00:01:04,624 --> 00:01:06,371
so here we go, we're gonna pop it like this.

49
00:01:06,371 --> 00:01:08,737
First skewer's gonna go in and then all the way down

50
00:01:08,737 --> 00:01:10,918
and then just go straight in, alright here we go,

51
00:01:10,918 --> 00:01:11,751
goin' straight in--

52
00:01:11,751 --> 00:01:13,414
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, where are you goin' with that?

53
00:01:13,414 --> 00:01:14,610
Right now I'm defining the neck

54
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,368
and separating the helmet from the body.

55
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:17,948
- My guy here, I gotta make the tongue,

56
00:01:17,948 --> 00:01:19,298
but I gotta be very precise with how I do this.

57
00:01:19,298 --> 00:01:20,340
What if I take a little bit of this

58
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,641
and then pop it in here like that?

59
00:01:21,641 --> 00:01:22,474
Bam, now we gotta perfect little clump tongue.

60
00:01:22,474 --> 00:01:24,560
- [Devan] Finishing up the head shape

61
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,989
and now it's time to make the mask.

62
00:01:25,989 --> 00:01:27,307
- Now, for the mask, you kinda wanna draw

63
00:01:27,307 --> 00:01:29,635
on the surface before you cut it.

64
00:01:29,635 --> 00:01:31,051
- [Collins] And I gotta give my Iron Man

65
00:01:31,051 --> 00:01:31,980
some nice buck teeth

66
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,227
you know, he's gettin' that real authentic Tony Stark look.

67
00:01:34,227 --> 00:01:35,590
- [Devan] Now I'm gonna use the paring knife

68
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:36,750
for the small eyes.

69
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:37,691
- Wait, what step are you on?

70
00:01:37,691 --> 00:01:38,708
- I'm on the same step as you!

71
00:01:38,708 --> 00:01:39,676
- [Collins] I'm on the step of creating

72
00:01:39,676 --> 00:01:40,683
his face and his eyebrows.

73
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:41,844
- You're definitely not creating eyebrows.

74
00:01:41,844 --> 00:01:43,898
- [Devan] Pullin' off the side here, a big chunk.

75
00:01:43,898 --> 00:01:45,610
- [Collins] Oh! How is that gonna help you shape?

76
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:48,227
Wait. What? Oh my gosh bro,

77
00:01:48,227 --> 00:01:49,807
right now it looks like an alien though.

78
00:01:49,807 --> 00:01:50,686
- [Devan] Now all I have to do

79
00:01:50,686 --> 00:01:51,961
is just take off this back stuff.

80
00:01:51,961 --> 00:01:53,587
- And do that, I'm gonna give my guy a neck!

81
00:01:53,587 --> 00:01:55,247
Really quickly just core out the center

82
00:01:55,247 --> 00:01:56,771
of it, like that, boom, see!

83
00:01:56,771 --> 00:01:57,736
Dude look, it like literally created

84
00:01:57,736 --> 00:01:59,472
a perfect ball of watermelon, man!

85
00:01:59,472 --> 00:02:00,857
- [Devan] I'm scoopin' out the face now

86
00:02:00,857 --> 00:02:01,974
to make room for the mask.

87
00:02:01,974 --> 00:02:03,104
- [Collins] And I'm scoopin' out the inside of mine,

88
00:02:03,104 --> 00:02:04,812
because it's very fun and I just, I enjoy doing this.

89
00:02:04,812 --> 00:02:06,258
- Got all my pieces and now it's time

90
00:02:06,258 --> 00:02:08,178
to assemble them and add the finishing touches.

91
00:02:08,178 --> 00:02:09,922
- [Devan] I'll be revealing mine at the end of the video,

92
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:11,205
and we're on to the next round!

93
00:02:11,205 --> 00:02:13,418
- [Collins] You challenged us to make giant pancake art,

94
00:02:13,418 --> 00:02:14,251
so let's go!

95
00:02:14,251 --> 00:02:16,427
Big 'ol head right there, like that, perfect.

96
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:17,494
- [Devan] Alright, so we're gonna give Godzilla

97
00:02:17,494 --> 00:02:18,508
some arms right here, so we're gonna give him

98
00:02:18,508 --> 00:02:20,644
a little arm over here, like yeah, what's up!

99
00:02:20,644 --> 00:02:22,843
And then another arm over here, like yeah, what's up!

100
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:23,884
- [Devan] I'm a little concerned,

101
00:02:23,884 --> 00:02:25,993
'cause he's looking like a plump baby right now.

102
00:02:25,993 --> 00:02:27,720
- [Collins] Devan look, my Godzilla's lookin'

103
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,553
at your Godzilla he's like, he's like,

104
00:02:28,553 --> 00:02:29,401
"What are you doing?

105
00:02:29,401 --> 00:02:31,304
"Why are you crushing all the buildings?"

106
00:02:31,304 --> 00:02:33,965
- [Devan] Gotta get this crazy lean,

107
00:02:33,965 --> 00:02:35,940
'cause Godzilla's really leanin' forward.

108
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,994
- [Collins] I'm gonna give him his little eyeballs

109
00:02:36,994 --> 00:02:39,083
right here, and by little eyeballs I mean big eyeballs!

110
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:40,653
My Godzilla's trippin' out, he's like,

111
00:02:40,653 --> 00:02:41,821
"What is going on?"

112
00:02:41,821 --> 00:02:42,859
- [Devan] Look, he's like a duck!

113
00:02:42,859 --> 00:02:43,969
- [Collins] Your Godzilla's lookin' like he's gonna quack

114
00:02:43,969 --> 00:02:45,182
while he's spittin' flames.

115
00:02:45,182 --> 00:02:46,281
Does Godzilla spit flames?

116
00:02:46,281 --> 00:02:47,159
- I think he does.

117
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:49,473
(whooshing)

118
00:02:49,473 --> 00:02:51,080
- I think it's broken, yeah, it's broken, yep.

119
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,367
- [Devan] I got his chest in place.

120
00:02:52,367 --> 00:02:53,930
- [Collins] Alright, now I'm gonna give him little scales,

121
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:55,019
you know, this is very important.

122
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:56,237
I know that Devan did this a lot on his,

123
00:02:56,237 --> 00:02:57,710
he gave his guy a whole bunch of scales.

124
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,018
- [Devan] Now it's time to add the little spikes.

125
00:02:59,018 --> 00:03:00,563
- [Collins] I'm gonna give my guy some little red shoes,

126
00:03:00,563 --> 00:03:01,625
like he's little red riding hood.

127
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:02,814
No, who is it that has red shoes?

128
00:03:02,814 --> 00:03:05,006
There's someone who goes, "Dorothy the Explorer."

129
00:03:05,006 --> 00:03:05,839
- No.

130
00:03:05,839 --> 00:03:06,672
- [Collins] There's someone with red shoes

131
00:03:06,672 --> 00:03:07,925
and my dude's got red shoes.

132
00:03:07,925 --> 00:03:09,291
- [Devan] Mine's grabbin' a car!

133
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:10,124
- [Collins] That's not fair!

134
00:03:10,124 --> 00:03:11,532
We can't add extra elements into it.

135
00:03:11,532 --> 00:03:12,504
- Yes, I can!

136
00:03:12,504 --> 00:03:13,845
- How would my guy grab a car?

137
00:03:13,845 --> 00:03:15,420
Look at his arms, man, he's like,

138
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,341
"Why would you grab the car?"

139
00:03:16,341 --> 00:03:18,158
- [Devan] Alright, my guy's ready to add color.

140
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:19,635
- [Collins] Just gonna go all around like this.

141
00:03:19,635 --> 00:03:21,469
No, dude, it's leakin' out the top again!

142
00:03:21,469 --> 00:03:22,525
Shoot, this is not what I want.

143
00:03:22,525 --> 00:03:23,971
You know what, this thing is ruined,

144
00:03:23,971 --> 00:03:25,127
it's done, man, this is over.

145
00:03:25,127 --> 00:03:25,960
Canceled.

146
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,218
- [Devan] I'm taking some creative liberties here

147
00:03:27,218 --> 00:03:29,083
and adding some purple into his spikes.

148
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,372
- Wait bro, you got that idea from me!

149
00:03:30,372 --> 00:03:31,205
Mine have purple spikes!

150
00:03:31,205 --> 00:03:32,038
- [Devan] Wait, you do?

151
00:03:32,038 --> 00:03:32,871
- [Collins] It's right there, bro!

152
00:03:32,871 --> 00:03:33,848
- [Devan] Alright, this is the easy part,

153
00:03:33,848 --> 00:03:34,941
just fillin' it in.

154
00:03:34,941 --> 00:03:35,978
- [Collins] Last but not least, I'm gonna give him

155
00:03:35,978 --> 00:03:36,919
a little welt on his forehead,

156
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:38,320
because unfortunately he got bonked

157
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,223
with the car that your dude threw.

158
00:03:40,223 --> 00:03:41,612
- [Devan] Alright, the finishing touch is done

159
00:03:41,612 --> 00:03:42,765
and now it's time to let it roast.

160
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:44,246
- Pancakes are cooked and now it's time

161
00:03:44,246 --> 00:03:46,498
for the flip, but is gonna be way too small, so yeet!

162
00:03:46,498 --> 00:03:47,814
We gotta get the giant flipper!

163
00:03:47,814 --> 00:03:49,413
- Oh no, okay, here we go, here we go,

164
00:03:49,413 --> 00:03:50,374
get the arm!

165
00:03:50,374 --> 00:03:52,445
Hey, hey, stop it, it's goin' great Devan.

166
00:03:52,445 --> 00:03:53,469
Here we go, so let's see, let's keep goin'

167
00:03:53,469 --> 00:03:54,302
underneath like this.

168
00:03:54,302 --> 00:03:55,135
Three,

169
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:55,968
two,

170
00:03:55,968 --> 00:03:56,801
one,

171
00:03:56,801 --> 00:03:58,368
oh!

172
00:03:58,368 --> 00:04:00,772
Oh my God, bro, first try with a massive flip!

173
00:04:00,772 --> 00:04:02,118
Dude, look at my guy bro, he's so good.

174
00:04:02,118 --> 00:04:04,164
- [Devan] Alright here we go, gonna try

175
00:04:04,164 --> 00:04:05,328
to get underneath it.

176
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,619
- [Collins] Oh man, it's so brittle.

177
00:04:06,619 --> 00:04:07,506
Are you sure you're gonna be able

178
00:04:07,506 --> 00:04:08,339
to do this without breaking it?

179
00:04:08,339 --> 00:04:09,572
- [Devan] Ready, set, go!

180
00:04:09,572 --> 00:04:11,343
(ominous music)

181
00:04:11,343 --> 00:04:12,809
Very delicately.

182
00:04:12,809 --> 00:04:13,691
- [Together] Oh, yes!

183
00:04:13,691 --> 00:04:15,950
- Bro, that looks so crazy!

184
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,611
- [Devan] He's actually kinda scaly.

185
00:04:17,611 --> 00:04:18,800
- [Collins] You get to comment down below,

186
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,065
who won this round, you challenged us to try pizza art.

187
00:04:21,065 --> 00:04:23,620
- [Devan] And we're makin' Spiderman from Avengers Endgame.

188
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,501
- [Together] Ohhh.

189
00:04:24,501 --> 00:04:25,674
- And we're off to a messy start,

190
00:04:25,674 --> 00:04:27,635
well, I got my dough, the thing is Devan

191
00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:29,143
I think you made a large, round, mistake.

192
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:31,471
You have a round pizza, which is a big no no

193
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:33,028
in creating Spiderman's head.

194
00:04:33,028 --> 00:04:35,137
- But a big yes yes when creating pizza.

195
00:04:35,137 --> 00:04:35,986
- Yes yes?

196
00:04:35,986 --> 00:04:36,984
- [Collins] All right, well you know what, here we go.

197
00:04:36,984 --> 00:04:38,160
Just gonna stretch it out like this.

198
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,598
- [Devan] Right now I'm just addin' the cheese.

199
00:04:39,598 --> 00:04:41,566
- Yo yours is way farther along than mine.

200
00:04:41,566 --> 00:04:42,399
- Yup.

201
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:44,516
I'm movin' right along to adding the pepperoni pieces.

202
00:04:44,516 --> 00:04:45,774
- [Collins] Next up, time to apply the tomato sauce

203
00:04:45,774 --> 00:04:48,049
so I've got this tomato sauce applying stick right here.

204
00:04:48,049 --> 00:04:50,252
It's in all the top restaurants in NYC right now.

205
00:04:50,252 --> 00:04:52,556
Just take an even distribution of the tomato sauce

206
00:04:52,556 --> 00:04:53,756
on your crust, just like this.

207
00:04:53,756 --> 00:04:54,607
Just roll it out like that.

208
00:04:54,607 --> 00:04:56,015
- [Devan] I really didn't think that would work,

209
00:04:56,015 --> 00:04:56,848
but it kinda does.

210
00:04:56,848 --> 00:04:57,846
- [Collins] It absolutely does.

211
00:04:57,846 --> 00:04:59,302
- [Devan] Now for the webs on Spiderman's face

212
00:04:59,302 --> 00:05:01,675
I've cut up a whole bunch of nori sheets into small strips.

213
00:05:01,675 --> 00:05:03,083
- [Collins] Just like you Devan, time to add

214
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:04,057
the white layer base.

215
00:05:04,057 --> 00:05:05,486
I'm gonna add a whole bunch of onions right now.

216
00:05:05,486 --> 00:05:06,319
Boom.

217
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:07,152
- Wait, did you just say onions?

218
00:05:07,152 --> 00:05:08,603
- Exactly, just like you Devan.

219
00:05:08,603 --> 00:05:11,410
- No. No no no, I added cheese, Hans.

220
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:12,243
- Wait, what?

221
00:05:12,243 --> 00:05:13,076
- Here we go, got some Parmesan right here.

222
00:05:13,076 --> 00:05:14,444
- [Devan] Hans, that is onion powder.

223
00:05:14,444 --> 00:05:15,277
- What!

224
00:05:15,277 --> 00:05:16,468
- That is powdered onion. (hacks)

225
00:05:16,468 --> 00:05:19,164
- [Devan] Putting in the final little touches, and--

226
00:05:19,164 --> 00:05:20,073
- [Collins] Oh, snap!

227
00:05:20,073 --> 00:05:20,906
- Devan wait. - What.

228
00:05:20,906 --> 00:05:22,006
- Oh. Nope. Totally good.

229
00:05:22,006 --> 00:05:22,973
- What are you looking at? - Nothing,

230
00:05:22,973 --> 00:05:24,211
there was nothing there.

231
00:05:24,211 --> 00:05:25,080
- I'm just wearing the merch.

232
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,892
- Yeah, it looks great on you Devan, oh it's nothing.

233
00:05:26,892 --> 00:05:27,800
- What. - Oh boy.

234
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,633
- No. - Yeah.

235
00:05:28,633 --> 00:05:29,466
- How did that...

236
00:05:29,466 --> 00:05:30,299
It was you.

237
00:05:30,299 --> 00:05:31,303
- It wasn't me. - It was this thing.

238
00:05:31,303 --> 00:05:32,727
- [Collins] That's not me, Devan, do I look like this?

239
00:05:32,727 --> 00:05:33,560
- [Devan] But you put it there.

240
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,989
- Face to face Devan, do I look anything like this?

241
00:05:34,989 --> 00:05:36,579
- Actually the resemblance is uncanny.

242
00:05:36,579 --> 00:05:37,720
Just doing the finishing touches

243
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,189
on the outline of the eye.

244
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:40,262
- [Collins] All right, now it's time for me to create

245
00:05:40,262 --> 00:05:41,703
my base, so I'm gonna use pepperonis, just like Devan.

246
00:05:41,703 --> 00:05:43,934
- [Devan] Got some sliced up bell pepper in here

247
00:05:43,934 --> 00:05:46,030
and I'm actually adding it around the side as

248
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:46,863
a nice little frame.

249
00:05:46,863 --> 00:05:48,018
- So to kick it off with his eyes, I've got

250
00:05:48,018 --> 00:05:49,427
two little olives over here, so go bloop.

251
00:05:49,427 --> 00:05:51,515
You need some garlic powder to make the rest of his eye,

252
00:05:51,515 --> 00:05:52,348
so here we go.

253
00:05:52,348 --> 00:05:53,432
Now we gotta make the mouth.

254
00:05:53,432 --> 00:05:54,477
I wanna use one of these bell peppers.

255
00:05:54,477 --> 00:05:55,316
I mean, is this a bell pepper?

256
00:05:55,316 --> 00:05:56,438
Really wanna find out if this is a bell pepper,

257
00:05:56,438 --> 00:05:57,271
you do this, here we go.

258
00:05:57,271 --> 00:05:58,104
Three, two, one --

259
00:05:58,104 --> 00:05:58,965
(bell clangs)

260
00:05:58,965 --> 00:06:01,317
Well, the stem was kinda weak on that one, so yeet.

261
00:06:01,317 --> 00:06:03,728
- [Devan] I'm also on the bell pepper step as well.

262
00:06:03,728 --> 00:06:05,916
- [Collins] I'm adding it on his face here for his mask.

263
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:08,141
Gonna use my bell pepper as two little eyebrows.

264
00:06:08,141 --> 00:06:10,001
You don't even know if that's Spiderman or not, man.

265
00:06:10,001 --> 00:06:11,251
- [Devan] Do you see these eyes?

266
00:06:11,251 --> 00:06:12,469
- [Collins] I dunno man, I think mine are much

267
00:06:12,469 --> 00:06:13,413
more expressive and emotive.

268
00:06:13,413 --> 00:06:14,246
(laughs)

269
00:06:14,246 --> 00:06:15,348
He's good.

270
00:06:15,348 --> 00:06:17,048
- [Devan] Background's done, face is down,

271
00:06:17,048 --> 00:06:18,659
and now it's time to add the onion eyes.

272
00:06:18,659 --> 00:06:20,282
- [Collins] If that was on a Pizza Hut menu bro,

273
00:06:20,282 --> 00:06:21,115
I would buy it in a second.

274
00:06:21,115 --> 00:06:23,185
Oh my gosh, your eyes are looking so good.

275
00:06:23,185 --> 00:06:24,752
Now he's gotta put a few finishing touches,

276
00:06:24,752 --> 00:06:25,993
then time to pop these in the oven.

277
00:06:25,993 --> 00:06:27,926
Pizza's are fully decorated and bro,

278
00:06:27,926 --> 00:06:29,042
that looks just like Spiderman,

279
00:06:29,042 --> 00:06:29,875
so here's the big reveal.

280
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:30,708
- [Together] Three,

281
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:31,541
two, - oh wait!

282
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:32,668
- [Collins] Five second subscribe challenge,

283
00:06:32,668 --> 00:06:34,220
we wanna see if you can subscribe to this channel

284
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,691
and turn on the channel post notifications

285
00:06:35,691 --> 00:06:37,538
in five seconds, you ready?

286
00:06:37,538 --> 00:06:38,786
Here we go. - [Together] Five,

287
00:06:38,786 --> 00:06:39,619
four,

288
00:06:39,619 --> 00:06:40,452
three,

289
00:06:40,452 --> 00:06:41,285
two,

290
00:06:41,285 --> 00:06:42,762
one,

291
00:06:42,762 --> 00:06:43,740
done. - When you do that,

292
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,180
comment down below keyper squad, right now--

293
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,277
- [Together] Ready

294
00:06:46,277 --> 00:06:47,110
set,

295
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:47,943
go, ta-da.

296
00:06:47,943 --> 00:06:49,731
- [Collins] Dude, that looks just like Spiderman.

297
00:06:49,731 --> 00:06:51,439
You get to comment down below, whose pizza

298
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:52,391
turned out better.

299
00:06:52,391 --> 00:06:54,001
And we'll be eating them at the end of the video.

300
00:06:54,001 --> 00:06:55,796
You challenged us to make Pumbaa from The Lion King,

301
00:06:55,796 --> 00:06:56,629
so let's go!

302
00:06:56,629 --> 00:06:58,351
- Now that I've got the face down, it's time to shape

303
00:06:58,351 --> 00:06:59,727
him into that Pumbaa shape.

304
00:06:59,727 --> 00:07:01,073
- [Collins] And I've got some blue here to turn

305
00:07:01,073 --> 00:07:03,682
these potatoes into the night sky in the background

306
00:07:03,682 --> 00:07:04,713
of my art, so here we go.

307
00:07:04,713 --> 00:07:06,096
- Collins, Collins. - I'm sorry, I'm just trying

308
00:07:06,096 --> 00:07:07,177
to make it mashed, bro, - This is everywhere.

309
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:08,828
- That's the reason why I wore blue, Devan,

310
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:09,975
so this would not affect me at all.

311
00:07:09,975 --> 00:07:11,512
- You couldn't have given me the memo?

312
00:07:11,512 --> 00:07:12,345
- And movin' on!

313
00:07:12,345 --> 00:07:13,178
We're gonna continue to

314
00:07:13,178 --> 00:07:14,011
create the sky right now.

315
00:07:14,011 --> 00:07:16,080
- [Devan] Grabbing some black beans for some details.

316
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,677
- [Collins] You're very delicate with this right now.

317
00:07:17,677 --> 00:07:19,761
The sky is the most important part of Pumbaa.

318
00:07:19,761 --> 00:07:21,288
Next up, time to make the body of Pumbaa, so

319
00:07:21,288 --> 00:07:23,626
boom again, we got some sweet potatoes.

320
00:07:23,626 --> 00:07:24,459
- Well, then.

321
00:07:24,459 --> 00:07:25,808
- [Collins] Now just gotta get in here and just kinda

322
00:07:25,808 --> 00:07:26,641
mix 'em up a little bit.

323
00:07:26,641 --> 00:07:28,721
Oh yeah, try to extract the good, sweet juices.

324
00:07:28,721 --> 00:07:30,343
- [Devan] His tongue is done and now it's time

325
00:07:30,343 --> 00:07:31,332
for the cheese.

326
00:07:31,332 --> 00:07:32,165
- Wait, the what?

327
00:07:32,165 --> 00:07:33,223
- The cheese for his tooth.

328
00:07:33,223 --> 00:07:35,205
Got the tooth cut out and now I'm gonna

329
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:36,589
make a space in the watermelon.

330
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:38,267
At what point are you gonna start shaping

331
00:07:38,267 --> 00:07:39,814
that into Pumbaa?

332
00:07:39,814 --> 00:07:40,647
- You don't see it?

333
00:07:40,647 --> 00:07:42,487
I thought I was pretty far along already.

334
00:07:42,487 --> 00:07:43,499
You don't see it for real?

335
00:07:43,499 --> 00:07:44,752
- I mean, maybe that's the eye there.

336
00:07:44,752 --> 00:07:45,585
- No.

337
00:07:45,585 --> 00:07:47,488
Gotta finish up all the hair around Pumbaa's

338
00:07:47,488 --> 00:07:48,870
head right now, so here we go.

339
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,459
Next up we gotta create the eyeballs,

340
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:51,292
so here we go.

341
00:07:51,292 --> 00:07:52,292
It's gonna go down like this. - [Devan] Nice.

342
00:07:52,292 --> 00:07:53,707
- [Collins] Now we gotta carve it around, so here we go.

343
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:54,846
Just gonna go kinda like this.

344
00:07:54,846 --> 00:07:56,456
- You're learning, young Padawan.

345
00:07:56,456 --> 00:07:57,721
- Boom, there we go, look at that.

346
00:07:57,721 --> 00:07:58,862
- Eyeball is done.

347
00:07:58,862 --> 00:08:00,101
This is pretty perfect, Devan.

348
00:08:00,101 --> 00:08:01,189
- Are you gonna ignore that?

349
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,779
- I mean, just the fact that it even is

350
00:08:02,779 --> 00:08:04,088
remotely round when it started off in this

351
00:08:04,088 --> 00:08:05,306
very clear square shape.

352
00:08:05,306 --> 00:08:07,252
Even little bit of color is stuck to the side.

353
00:08:07,252 --> 00:08:08,085
You know what I call this Devan?

354
00:08:08,085 --> 00:08:08,918
Blue cheese.

355
00:08:08,918 --> 00:08:10,039
- [Devan] Ah, there it is. - [Collins] Yes.

356
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:11,558
- [Devan] I'm adding in a second layer here,

357
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:14,036
just adding more 3D elements.

358
00:08:14,036 --> 00:08:17,284
- Oh boy, he's looking kinda scarier and scarier

359
00:08:17,284 --> 00:08:18,578
by the moment, I gotta say.

360
00:08:18,578 --> 00:08:20,571
- [Devan] Next up I'm using some strips of eggplant

361
00:08:20,571 --> 00:08:21,408
for the eyes.

362
00:08:21,408 --> 00:08:23,217
Your guy is terrifying right now.

363
00:08:23,217 --> 00:08:24,050
(crazed laughter)

364
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,722
If that's what Pumbaa looks like in the movie dude,

365
00:08:25,722 --> 00:08:27,900
I gotta get my tickets right now from Fandango.

366
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,256
- [Collins] Dude, look

367
00:08:29,256 --> 00:08:31,544
he's balding, so not a hair on the top.

368
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:33,127
- [Devan] Filling in the rest of the face,

369
00:08:33,127 --> 00:08:34,459
then I'm moving back to the eyes.

370
00:08:34,459 --> 00:08:35,723
- [Collins] And I'm gonna make some stars

371
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:36,973
for my night sky 'cause I really wanna add

372
00:08:36,973 --> 00:08:39,282
some depth and texture to my image here.

373
00:08:39,282 --> 00:08:40,637
There we go, star number one.

374
00:08:40,637 --> 00:08:42,346
- [Devan] All right, the face and the nose is done,

375
00:08:42,346 --> 00:08:43,526
now it's time to add the nostrils.

376
00:08:43,526 --> 00:08:45,902
- All right, well now I gotta add in my round moon.

377
00:08:45,902 --> 00:08:46,945
(laughter)

378
00:08:46,945 --> 00:08:48,175
Shoot the moon.

379
00:08:48,175 --> 00:08:49,717
- [Devan] Time to add in the blue sky and

380
00:08:49,717 --> 00:08:51,153
put on the finishing touches.

381
00:08:51,153 --> 00:08:53,015
- Dude, your Pumbaa looks just like a warthog,

382
00:08:53,015 --> 00:08:54,105
and here's the big reveal.

383
00:08:54,105 --> 00:08:54,938
- [Together] Ready,

384
00:08:54,938 --> 00:08:55,771
set,

385
00:08:55,771 --> 00:08:56,604
go, ta da.

386
00:08:56,604 --> 00:08:57,881
- [Collins] Oh my gosh. - [Devan] Dude.

387
00:08:57,881 --> 00:08:58,714
- [Collins] That looks so good.

388
00:08:58,714 --> 00:08:59,631
- [Devan] And yours looks--

389
00:08:59,631 --> 00:09:00,464
(laughter)

390
00:09:00,464 --> 00:09:01,454
Amazing. - [Collins] Thank you.

391
00:09:01,454 --> 00:09:03,385
You get to comment down below who won this round

392
00:09:03,385 --> 00:09:05,027
and we'll be eating them at the end of the video.

393
00:09:05,027 --> 00:09:07,269
You challenged us to do a Bento Box art Pikachu,

394
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:08,102
so let's go.

395
00:09:08,102 --> 00:09:10,168
- [Devan] I'm startin' off with the yellow rice for Pikachu.

396
00:09:10,168 --> 00:09:11,873
- [Collins] Add some blueberries in just like that.

397
00:09:11,873 --> 00:09:12,706
Perfect, so yeet.

398
00:09:12,706 --> 00:09:14,205
- Pikachu's done now, it's time for Bulbasaur.

399
00:09:14,205 --> 00:09:15,721
- I gotta say, this blue works a lot better than

400
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:16,681
the blueberries, man.

401
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,223
It's almost like too much, it's almost turning

402
00:09:18,223 --> 00:09:19,123
too dark right now.

403
00:09:19,123 --> 00:09:20,869
It's like those guys with those crystal balls, man,

404
00:09:20,869 --> 00:09:21,702
they just go like --

405
00:09:21,702 --> 00:09:22,535
- Yup.

406
00:09:22,535 --> 00:09:24,354
- Now it's time for the plop and drop,

407
00:09:24,354 --> 00:09:25,749
so time to activate my Bulbasaur --

408
00:09:25,749 --> 00:09:27,017
- [Devan] You're who?

409
00:09:27,017 --> 00:09:28,171
- [Collins] My Bulbasaur.

410
00:09:28,171 --> 00:09:29,629
Three, two, one.

411
00:09:29,629 --> 00:09:30,919
There we go, perfect.

412
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:31,752
So here we go. - [Devan] Wow.

413
00:09:31,752 --> 00:09:32,700
- [Collins] Bulbasaur is in.

414
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,853
- The thing my Bulbasaur is missing

415
00:09:33,853 --> 00:09:35,536
is his bulb, so I'm using an artichoke.

416
00:09:35,536 --> 00:09:37,443
- And I'm using an eggplant and an artichoke.

417
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:39,503
- Next up, I gotta make Pikachu, so I gotta get

418
00:09:39,503 --> 00:09:40,705
some rice here, I gotta turn it yellow.

419
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,578
So here we go, add the yellow color in like this.

420
00:09:42,578 --> 00:09:44,271
- [Devan] I'm thinking this is gonna be more 3D

421
00:09:44,271 --> 00:09:45,739
than my art normally is.

422
00:09:45,739 --> 00:09:47,028
So I'm gonna actually have his foot coming

423
00:09:47,028 --> 00:09:48,315
outside of the box.

424
00:09:48,315 --> 00:09:49,342
- And I'm going to use these carrots

425
00:09:49,342 --> 00:09:51,347
as little chopsticks to grab the chunks of rice.

426
00:09:51,347 --> 00:09:52,553
Here we go, this is going to be Pikachu's head

427
00:09:52,553 --> 00:09:53,641
so here we go, the next one.

428
00:09:53,641 --> 00:09:54,919
Doing Pikachu's body like this.

429
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:55,752
The issue is I got too much yellow rice

430
00:09:55,752 --> 00:09:57,646
for Pikachu, so I got a different idea.

431
00:09:57,646 --> 00:09:58,479
I'm only going to make

432
00:09:58,479 --> 00:09:59,312
half of Pikachu's head over here.

433
00:09:59,312 --> 00:10:00,326
So half of the mystery is

434
00:10:00,326 --> 00:10:01,783
where'd the other half of his head go?

435
00:10:01,783 --> 00:10:03,593
- I think it's time to move onto the background.

436
00:10:03,593 --> 00:10:05,889
I've got the base done, so now I just gotta

437
00:10:05,889 --> 00:10:07,845
add this lettuce in here like this.

438
00:10:07,845 --> 00:10:09,523
- Hey Devin, I want to suck your blood.

439
00:10:09,523 --> 00:10:10,715
- Take those legs out.

440
00:10:10,715 --> 00:10:11,548
- Why not?

441
00:10:11,548 --> 00:10:12,381
- Yeet.

442
00:10:12,381 --> 00:10:13,608
- Excuse me, Devan, that was a fleet.

443
00:10:13,608 --> 00:10:14,634
If you're gonna fleet my teeth,

444
00:10:14,634 --> 00:10:15,467
you gotta fleet them correctly.

445
00:10:15,467 --> 00:10:18,111
- The key to the background is to take this lettuce

446
00:10:18,111 --> 00:10:19,439
and we'll roll it up just like this

447
00:10:19,439 --> 00:10:20,415
and then place it in.

448
00:10:20,415 --> 00:10:21,912
- Next it's time to place Pikachu's eyes

449
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:23,708
underneath the mushrooms right now.

450
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:24,717
The first represents his eye.

451
00:10:24,717 --> 00:10:25,878
- Once the background's done,

452
00:10:25,878 --> 00:10:27,508
now just gotta do Pikachu's tail

453
00:10:27,508 --> 00:10:28,341
and Bulbasaur's face.

454
00:10:28,341 --> 00:10:29,425
- And I got a mango here

455
00:10:29,425 --> 00:10:31,457
just giving me the front of Bulbasaurs, man.

456
00:10:31,457 --> 00:10:32,522
Here we go. It's going to -

457
00:10:32,522 --> 00:10:34,139
- Bulbasaur, Collin, bulbasaurus.

458
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:35,642
- I'm sorry, I'll get it right at some point.

459
00:10:35,642 --> 00:10:36,475
Here we go.

460
00:10:36,475 --> 00:10:37,308
(groan)

461
00:10:37,308 --> 00:10:38,461
I've got the mango stars,

462
00:10:38,461 --> 00:10:39,793
so here we go, I'm gonna get this out right now.

463
00:10:39,793 --> 00:10:40,626
Let's see.

464
00:10:40,626 --> 00:10:42,159
- Goin' in for Pikachu's tail.

465
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:43,855
I kind of wanted to twist like a lightening bolt.

466
00:10:43,855 --> 00:10:45,142
- For a piece of art, Bulbasaur's belly.

467
00:10:45,142 --> 00:10:46,263
So, there we go.

468
00:10:46,263 --> 00:10:47,096
Bam, look at that.

469
00:10:47,096 --> 00:10:49,329
It's like, "Check out my cute belly button."

470
00:10:49,329 --> 00:10:50,367
- Now I'm using two kiwis.

471
00:10:50,367 --> 00:10:52,514
One is for the top part of his head.

472
00:10:52,514 --> 00:10:53,610
And now I'm using the other half

473
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:54,688
for the lid of the hat.

474
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:55,738
- My Bulbasaur I'm gonna add

475
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:56,751
a whole bunch of vines

476
00:10:56,751 --> 00:10:58,551
so that's a big part of his personality.

477
00:10:58,551 --> 00:11:00,404
I'm gonna have a whole bunch of different types

478
00:11:00,404 --> 00:11:01,273
of shrubbery pointing out of him here.

479
00:11:01,273 --> 00:11:02,794
So, here we go, gimme a prickly fella.

480
00:11:02,794 --> 00:11:04,426
- Time to add his rosy cheeks,

481
00:11:04,426 --> 00:11:05,830
and I'm actually gonna use these cherry tomatoes

482
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:08,265
cut in half and those will be his little cheeks.

483
00:11:08,265 --> 00:11:09,763
Second cheek is done.

484
00:11:09,763 --> 00:11:11,112
Man, my guy is looking really cute.

485
00:11:11,112 --> 00:11:13,707
- Yo, imagine if they had a Pokeman bento box's lunchable.

486
00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:14,574
That would be insane.

487
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:16,061
- So next up, gotta a mango here,

488
00:11:16,061 --> 00:11:17,682
and the mango is going to be Charizard.

489
00:11:17,682 --> 00:11:18,674
Wait, no, no, no.

490
00:11:18,674 --> 00:11:19,507
What's his name?

491
00:11:19,507 --> 00:11:20,340
- Bulbasaur.

492
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,173
- So, that's it.

493
00:11:21,173 --> 00:11:22,006
- Bulbasaur.

494
00:11:22,006 --> 00:11:23,110
- I'll pop it here like this.

495
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:25,553
- Isn't mango Pikashu's hat or Bulbasaur's head?

496
00:11:25,553 --> 00:11:26,386
- Yes.

497
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:27,522
- I guess I'm not gonna get an answer to that.

498
00:11:27,522 --> 00:11:28,355
- Yes.

499
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:29,926
- Next I'm adding in the black part to his ears

500
00:11:29,926 --> 00:11:30,759
with the nori sheet.

501
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:33,512
Oh no, I think I added a little goatee on accident.

502
00:11:33,512 --> 00:11:34,345
Gotta take it off.

503
00:11:34,345 --> 00:11:35,525
Now Detective Pikachu would be nothing

504
00:11:35,525 --> 00:11:36,996
without his magnifying glass.

505
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:38,846
I'm using this pretzel here as a stock.

506
00:11:38,846 --> 00:11:39,763
- The stock?

507
00:11:39,763 --> 00:11:40,917
For the background, I've got

508
00:11:40,917 --> 00:11:41,817
a whole bunch of nori sheets right here.

509
00:11:41,817 --> 00:11:43,930
Detective Pikachu only works at night man, so here we go.

510
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:45,126
It's gonna crumple it up a lot--

511
00:11:45,126 --> 00:11:45,959
- Only at night.

512
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:46,792
Just put a little glitter here.

513
00:11:46,792 --> 00:11:47,625
Exactly, Devan.

514
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:48,579
Yours is not only look like Detective Pikachu,

515
00:11:48,579 --> 00:11:49,412
it looks like Defective Pikachu.

516
00:11:49,412 --> 00:11:51,251
- Mine is looking defective, dude?

517
00:11:51,251 --> 00:11:52,084
- Yeah.

518
00:11:52,084 --> 00:11:52,917
- What's goin' on with your guy's eyes?

519
00:11:52,917 --> 00:11:54,441
- He's just havin' a weird night, man.

520
00:11:54,441 --> 00:11:56,894
He's a little bit of a tough case to crack, you know?

521
00:11:56,894 --> 00:11:57,822
- Now for the magnifying glass,

522
00:11:57,822 --> 00:12:00,346
I'm actually using this agar-agar.

523
00:12:00,346 --> 00:12:01,179
- Whoah.

524
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:02,180
- Look at that, dude.

525
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,741
- Mine is holding a whole bunch of pretzels,

526
00:12:03,741 --> 00:12:04,955
to make it look like I'm doing something

527
00:12:04,955 --> 00:12:06,152
'cause I have nothing to do right now.

528
00:12:06,152 --> 00:12:07,697
- So for the eyes, I'm cutting a raspberry

529
00:12:07,697 --> 00:12:10,051
in half and putting them on just like that.

530
00:12:10,051 --> 00:12:11,548
Now it's time to make this thing look saucy.

531
00:12:11,548 --> 00:12:13,571
- The bento box art is facing.

532
00:12:13,571 --> 00:12:15,066
Dude, yours looks so good, bro.

533
00:12:15,066 --> 00:12:15,931
So, here's the big reveal.

534
00:12:15,931 --> 00:12:16,764
- [Unison] Three

535
00:12:16,764 --> 00:12:17,597
Two

536
00:12:17,597 --> 00:12:18,430
- Oh wait.

537
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:19,263
- Three second like challenge,

538
00:12:19,263 --> 00:12:20,096
we want to see if you can like this video

539
00:12:20,096 --> 00:12:20,929
in three seconds.

540
00:12:20,929 --> 00:12:21,762
So you're ready?

541
00:12:21,762 --> 00:12:22,595
Here we go.

542
00:12:22,595 --> 00:12:23,428
- [Unison] Three

543
00:12:23,428 --> 00:12:24,261
Two

544
00:12:24,261 --> 00:12:25,094
One

545
00:12:25,094 --> 00:12:25,927
Done

546
00:12:25,927 --> 00:12:26,760
Ready

547
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,593
Set

548
00:12:27,593 --> 00:12:28,426
Go.

549
00:12:28,426 --> 00:12:29,259
Tada!

550
00:12:29,259 --> 00:12:30,263
- That looks so good with the magnifying glass

551
00:12:30,263 --> 00:12:31,096
and everything, man.

552
00:12:31,096 --> 00:12:31,929
You get to comment down below,

553
00:12:31,929 --> 00:12:33,070
whose ding thing turned out better?

554
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:34,522
We'll be eatin' them at the end of the video.

555
00:12:34,522 --> 00:12:35,475
You've challenged us

556
00:12:35,475 --> 00:12:36,815
to make a Guardians of the Galaxy bowl,

557
00:12:36,815 --> 00:12:37,648
so let's go.

558
00:12:37,648 --> 00:12:38,925
- Step number one, we're melting down

559
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,400
the organic unsweetened taro.

560
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,988
- And I'm adding in the yogurt chips right now,

561
00:12:41,988 --> 00:12:43,677
some of the food has been kind of questionable

562
00:12:43,677 --> 00:12:44,510
and how delicious it would be

563
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,946
but this, this looks like it's goin'

564
00:12:45,946 --> 00:12:46,779
to be amazing.

565
00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:47,869
- And now it's time to mix in the colors.

566
00:12:47,869 --> 00:12:49,083
So, here we go, just gonna add

567
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:49,916
a couple of drops right here.

568
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:51,851
- I got my premade colors right here.

569
00:12:51,851 --> 00:12:53,079
- You are always one step ahead of me.

570
00:12:53,079 --> 00:12:54,801
I gotta get better at this whole preparation thing.

571
00:12:54,801 --> 00:12:55,801
- I got my spoonful here and I'm gonna

572
00:12:55,801 --> 00:12:59,038
start drizzling it onto the little bowls.

573
00:12:59,038 --> 00:13:00,862
Going in just like this.

574
00:13:00,862 --> 00:13:01,695
- Oh my gosh.

575
00:13:01,695 --> 00:13:03,176
- Done with the blue, time for the pink.

576
00:13:03,176 --> 00:13:04,745
- I don't think I'm drizzling quite right, man.

577
00:13:04,745 --> 00:13:05,836
How did you get your drizzle so nice?

578
00:13:05,836 --> 00:13:06,987
- While you're drizzling,

579
00:13:06,987 --> 00:13:08,037
I'm gonna do the next step

580
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,242
which is painting the inside of these little bowls.

581
00:13:10,242 --> 00:13:11,229
- I don't think workin' out

582
00:13:11,229 --> 00:13:12,062
as well as yours does.

583
00:13:12,062 --> 00:13:13,316
- You gotta finesse it, Collins.

584
00:13:13,316 --> 00:13:14,149
- Is this how you finesse it?

585
00:13:14,149 --> 00:13:15,734
- I'm switchin' up to the spoon technique.

586
00:13:15,734 --> 00:13:16,567
No more brushing.

587
00:13:16,567 --> 00:13:18,317
- Next, I've actually got a different technique,

588
00:13:18,317 --> 00:13:19,624
one where I'll be usin' balloons.

589
00:13:19,624 --> 00:13:21,193
You just dip it fully in.

590
00:13:21,193 --> 00:13:22,026
- Lovely.

591
00:13:22,026 --> 00:13:22,938
- Now that it has a little bowl cut,

592
00:13:22,938 --> 00:13:24,152
just like Devan, when Devan and I when we younger.

593
00:13:24,152 --> 00:13:25,290
Yup. That is actually us.

594
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:26,123
- Yeah.

595
00:13:26,123 --> 00:13:27,135
- Time to pop this in the cup here.

596
00:13:27,135 --> 00:13:27,968
So here he goes.

597
00:13:27,968 --> 00:13:29,500
- Oooh, he looks like a funny little dude.

598
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,421
Now that I've got the dollops in,

599
00:13:30,421 --> 00:13:32,473
I'm doin' the finishing touches with a brush.

600
00:13:32,473 --> 00:13:33,379
We blended up a whole bunch of bananas,

601
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:35,092
and this is going to act as the creamy base.

602
00:13:35,092 --> 00:13:36,482
Now, it's time to create the galaxy.

603
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,080
- Time to add in all the different colors.

604
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,392
First I've got some spirulina here.

605
00:13:39,392 --> 00:13:41,431
I'm startin' with blue, you're startin' with green.

606
00:13:41,431 --> 00:13:42,741
Power's all there man.

607
00:13:42,741 --> 00:13:44,043
- This is gonna amazing.

608
00:13:44,043 --> 00:13:44,876
- It looks like a whole bunch

609
00:13:44,876 --> 00:13:46,181
of little stars and planets, man.

610
00:13:46,181 --> 00:13:47,014
- Yeah.

611
00:13:47,014 --> 00:13:48,523
- And get all of the grains and textures in it.

612
00:13:48,523 --> 00:13:49,934
That yeah that didn't sound too confident.

613
00:13:49,934 --> 00:13:50,767
- Yeah, I don't know man.

614
00:13:50,767 --> 00:13:52,076
Next up I'm goin' with black.

615
00:13:52,076 --> 00:13:53,571
- Oh, to represent, like, space?

616
00:13:53,571 --> 00:13:54,404
- Yup.

617
00:13:54,404 --> 00:13:55,860
- Yo. That got real dark, real quick, man.

618
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,321
- This looks like some magnetic slime.

619
00:13:58,321 --> 00:14:00,220
Now it's time to construct the bowl,

620
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,638
so I'm putting down the granola base.

621
00:14:01,638 --> 00:14:02,845
- I got granola bars, man.

622
00:14:02,845 --> 00:14:03,780
These are granola bars,

623
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,613
you gotta mash them down

624
00:14:04,613 --> 00:14:06,134
in the granola you want it to be, just like that.

625
00:14:06,134 --> 00:14:07,475
I gotta get some of this granola.

626
00:14:07,475 --> 00:14:08,545
- Are you serious, dude?

627
00:14:08,545 --> 00:14:10,132
- It didn't quite add enough, so here we go.

628
00:14:10,132 --> 00:14:11,509
Gives it granola, so yeet.

629
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:13,670
- You wanna add each color one at a time,

630
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:14,723
right next to each other.

631
00:14:14,723 --> 00:14:16,513
- Next, I'm tryin' to add some of the edible glitter

632
00:14:16,513 --> 00:14:18,173
and oh man you gotta be careful with this stuff, I guess,

633
00:14:18,173 --> 00:14:19,326
just kind of give it a little sprinkle.

634
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:20,159
- There we go.

635
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,992
- This is your chance to add a different color

636
00:14:20,992 --> 00:14:21,825
than you had before.

637
00:14:21,825 --> 00:14:23,411
- Exactly, time to do the swirl.

638
00:14:23,411 --> 00:14:24,244
- [Unison] Three,

639
00:14:24,244 --> 00:14:25,077
Two,

640
00:14:25,077 --> 00:14:25,910
One,

641
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,143
oh man.

642
00:14:27,143 --> 00:14:27,976
- Yeah.

643
00:14:27,976 --> 00:14:29,434
- Yeah, this multi-skewer approach is,

644
00:14:29,434 --> 00:14:31,147
oh boy, wrapping it very badly.

645
00:14:31,147 --> 00:14:32,272
- This looks great, man.

646
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:33,416
- What about the one skewer?

647
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:34,397
Maybe his would be a little better.

648
00:14:34,397 --> 00:14:35,843
- A little dainty swirl, just like this.

649
00:14:35,843 --> 00:14:37,806
Man, you're is looking way cooler.

650
00:14:37,806 --> 00:14:39,660
Why's mine not turning out the same way, man?

651
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,368
Cause we both do the same process but--

652
00:14:41,368 --> 00:14:42,531
- Yours is looking crusty.

653
00:14:42,531 --> 00:14:43,364
- Excuse me.

654
00:14:43,364 --> 00:14:44,789
- Now it's time to add the carrob balls

655
00:14:44,789 --> 00:14:46,477
and the awesome finishing touches.

656
00:14:46,477 --> 00:14:48,284
- Yo, dude, that was just like the galaxy,

657
00:14:48,284 --> 00:14:49,117
and here's the big reveal.

658
00:14:49,117 --> 00:14:49,950
- [Unison] Ready,

659
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:50,783
set,

660
00:14:50,783 --> 00:14:51,616
go.

661
00:14:51,616 --> 00:14:52,449
Ta da!

662
00:14:52,449 --> 00:14:53,282
- [Collin] Bro, that is so crazy.

663
00:14:53,282 --> 00:14:54,356
- [Devan] It turned out so good man.

664
00:14:54,356 --> 00:14:55,253
You need to comment down below.

665
00:14:55,253 --> 00:14:56,086
- [Collin] Who won this round

666
00:14:56,086 --> 00:14:58,044
and we'll be eating them at the end of the video.

667
00:14:58,044 --> 00:14:58,877
- [Devan] We got all the foods

668
00:14:58,877 --> 00:14:59,710
and now it's time to see how they taste?

669
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:01,011
- And mine's got someone's garlic powder

670
00:15:01,011 --> 00:15:01,999
and onion powder, bro,

671
00:15:01,999 --> 00:15:03,400
it's going to be an intense experience.

672
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,233
Three,

673
00:15:04,233 --> 00:15:05,066
two,

674
00:15:05,066 --> 00:15:05,899
one,

675
00:15:05,899 --> 00:15:06,732
oh.

676
00:15:06,732 --> 00:15:09,021
- I will warn you, it definitely has the ability

677
00:15:09,021 --> 00:15:10,240
to wreck your entire arm.

678
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,977
- Oh yes, I am figuring that out right now.

679
00:15:12,977 --> 00:15:16,429
- Oh, no! My favorite part, the mouth,

680
00:15:16,429 --> 00:15:17,853
I just wrecked his mouth.

681
00:15:17,853 --> 00:15:19,223
Well, my guy just lost half his face.

682
00:15:19,223 --> 00:15:20,453
- That was his face?

683
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:21,954
- I gotta get the slice right over here

684
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:22,950
by his head, man.

685
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:23,951
And there's my slice.

686
00:15:23,951 --> 00:15:26,013
All right, there we go, we got all the ingredients --

687
00:15:26,013 --> 00:15:27,124
- Oh, oh. Yeah.

688
00:15:27,124 --> 00:15:28,875
- Oh, my gosh.

689
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:31,206
I wanna see if the art tastes as good as it looks.

690
00:15:31,206 --> 00:15:32,039
Ready?

691
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:32,872
- [Unison] Set,

692
00:15:32,872 --> 00:15:33,705
go!

693
00:15:33,705 --> 00:15:34,538
Whoa!

694
00:15:36,288 --> 00:15:37,121
- You okay?

695
00:15:37,121 --> 00:15:37,954
- No.

696
00:15:37,954 --> 00:15:41,211
- Oh my goodness, this is one of the best

697
00:15:41,211 --> 00:15:42,444
pizzas I've ever had.

698
00:15:42,444 --> 00:15:44,782
- That is an assault on the taste buds.

699
00:15:44,782 --> 00:15:46,004
Yo, dude, that was so intense.

700
00:15:46,004 --> 00:15:47,603
And right now, we're on to the next one.

701
00:15:47,603 --> 00:15:50,436
We got out our Detective Pikachu bento boxes right here,

702
00:15:50,436 --> 00:15:51,401
and time to see how these taste.

703
00:15:51,401 --> 00:15:53,035
I got Squirtle and what's this guy's name again?

704
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:53,872
- Bulbasaur

705
00:15:53,872 --> 00:15:55,630
- Bulbasaur, there we go, I got Bulbasaur

706
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:58,116
and Pikachu, but just the top half is Pikachu.

707
00:15:58,116 --> 00:16:00,273
Oh, dude, it's going to be a mask.

708
00:16:00,273 --> 00:16:01,106
- Yeah.

709
00:16:01,106 --> 00:16:02,229
- I'm Detective Pikachu.

710
00:16:02,229 --> 00:16:03,062
- Whoah.

711
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:03,895
- I'm going to--

712
00:16:03,895 --> 00:16:04,728
- You're dropping everything.

713
00:16:04,728 --> 00:16:05,561
- I'm sorry, I--

714
00:16:05,561 --> 00:16:06,923
- Great, I got the face of Bulbasaur,

715
00:16:06,923 --> 00:16:09,526
and I'm using the magnifying glass as the plate.

716
00:16:09,526 --> 00:16:11,787
- I got some blue rice as kind of a base right here.

717
00:16:11,787 --> 00:16:12,620
- It's like his nose.

718
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,306
- Oh my gosh, yours looks way more

719
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,936
appetizing than mine, to be honest.

720
00:16:15,936 --> 00:16:16,866
Can I just eat your Pikachu?

721
00:16:16,866 --> 00:16:17,837
- First, you gotta grab and take

722
00:16:17,837 --> 00:16:18,670
the Pikachu's hat like this.

723
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:19,603
Just like this over the kiwi.

724
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:21,020
- Ready, set, go!

725
00:16:24,188 --> 00:16:25,021
- [Devan] What was that?

726
00:16:25,021 --> 00:16:25,854
- I bit the whole kiwi.

727
00:16:25,854 --> 00:16:26,687
- What?

728
00:16:26,687 --> 00:16:27,520
- That was not the best.

729
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,050
- Mine tastes just as good as mine looked.

730
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,065
- And mine tastes just as weird

731
00:16:30,065 --> 00:16:31,519
as mine looked, so right now we're

732
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:32,352
onto the next one.

733
00:16:32,352 --> 00:16:33,543
- We got Pumba, now it's time

734
00:16:33,543 --> 00:16:34,592
to see how Pumba tastes.

735
00:16:34,592 --> 00:16:35,831
Bro, yours has got some weird flavors

736
00:16:35,831 --> 00:16:37,005
going on like with the watermelon

737
00:16:37,005 --> 00:16:38,335
and the black beans and the cheese.

738
00:16:38,335 --> 00:16:39,168
- You know what?

739
00:16:39,168 --> 00:16:40,001
I got to try them all.

740
00:16:40,001 --> 00:16:41,052
- So I guess for me, I'm going to start

741
00:16:41,052 --> 00:16:43,009
off with my, with my shooting moon over here.

742
00:16:43,009 --> 00:16:44,220
So it's going to slice right into it,

743
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,155
bulb out just like that.

744
00:16:45,155 --> 00:16:46,254
There's half of the moon right there.

745
00:16:46,254 --> 00:16:48,015
Whoa, dude, it looks like it's bugging right now.

746
00:16:48,015 --> 00:16:49,307
Its eyes are like, popping out.

747
00:16:49,307 --> 00:16:50,140
- Oh my Goodness.

748
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:50,973
- This is kinda scary, man.

749
00:16:50,973 --> 00:16:52,011
- If it wasn't scary already.

750
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:52,870
- Exactly.

751
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:53,703
- Oh!

752
00:16:53,703 --> 00:16:56,199
- Going right underneath and just like that

753
00:16:56,199 --> 00:16:57,706
I got Pumba's face.

754
00:16:57,706 --> 00:17:00,204
- Oh my gosh, bro, that's like a pizza slice right there.

755
00:17:00,204 --> 00:17:01,037
- Yup.

756
00:17:01,037 --> 00:17:02,177
- All right, well, I got mine, you got yours?

757
00:17:02,177 --> 00:17:03,010
- I got mine.

758
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:04,257
- And let's see how these things taste.

759
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:05,118
Ready, here we go.

760
00:17:05,118 --> 00:17:06,190
- Three, two--

761
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:07,443
- Oh, wait! If you want to win

762
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,755
a fifteen minute video call with Devin and I

763
00:17:09,755 --> 00:17:12,272
text the word pizza to 81800 right now,

764
00:17:12,272 --> 00:17:13,861
so pause the video, text the word pizza

765
00:17:13,861 --> 00:17:15,694
to 81800, you'll automatically be entered

766
00:17:15,694 --> 00:17:17,060
in to win and let's see how it tastes.

767
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,477
- Ready, set, go!

768
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:27,544
- I wanted the watermelon to make it better.

769
00:17:27,544 --> 00:17:28,991
- That's a terrible idea.

770
00:17:28,991 --> 00:17:31,060
Why the heck would you do that, bro?

771
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,053
- That was actually the key to this whole thing, dude.

772
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:34,231
- Really? Mine dish wasn't too bad.

773
00:17:34,231 --> 00:17:35,511
Right now, we're onto the next one.

774
00:17:35,511 --> 00:17:36,344
We got the Galaxy bowls in time

775
00:17:36,344 --> 00:17:38,092
to find out how they taste.

776
00:17:38,092 --> 00:17:38,925
- Dude, look at mine.

777
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:40,768
It looks nothing like it used to.

778
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:41,666
- Look at mine, bro.

779
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:42,499
What happened, bro?

780
00:17:42,499 --> 00:17:44,308
- I think they melt super fast.

781
00:17:44,308 --> 00:17:45,141
- You know what?

782
00:17:45,141 --> 00:17:46,605
I got a finishing touch up for mine and here we go.

783
00:17:46,605 --> 00:17:48,245
We got mine balloon and my bowl.

784
00:17:48,245 --> 00:17:49,078
- Oh, yeah, the bowl cut.

785
00:17:49,078 --> 00:17:50,057
- Yeah, so, maybe, excuse me?

786
00:17:50,057 --> 00:17:51,241
We do it together on the count of three.

787
00:17:51,241 --> 00:17:52,074
Here we go, ready?

788
00:17:52,074 --> 00:17:53,407
Three, two, one.

789
00:17:55,493 --> 00:17:56,535
- Yes!

790
00:17:56,535 --> 00:17:57,908
- Now we gotta flip it up, gotta flip it up.

791
00:17:57,908 --> 00:17:58,982
- Oh my God! - Nice!

792
00:17:58,982 --> 00:17:59,865
- Don't break it, don't break it.

793
00:17:59,865 --> 00:18:00,698
- All right, there we go.

794
00:18:00,698 --> 00:18:04,005
The bowl cut is rather good but not yet really good.

795
00:18:04,005 --> 00:18:06,043
Luckily, we got an even bigger one here.

796
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:06,876
Oh my gosh, look, oh!

797
00:18:06,876 --> 00:18:07,709
- What!

798
00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:11,112
- Oh my gosh, bro!

799
00:18:11,112 --> 00:18:12,825
Time to scoop up some of mine here.

800
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:14,046
- I'm trying to break one of these in half.

801
00:18:14,046 --> 00:18:15,075
- Why don't you take the whole thing.

802
00:18:15,075 --> 00:18:16,234
- Yeah, I'll take the whole planet.

803
00:18:16,234 --> 00:18:17,907
Get some granola in there, yeah.

804
00:18:17,907 --> 00:18:18,806
- All right, well here we go.

805
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,223
- Ready, set, go!

806
00:18:22,345 --> 00:18:23,178
- Whoa!

807
00:18:23,178 --> 00:18:24,791
- Oh man, bro!

808
00:18:24,791 --> 00:18:27,700
Maybe one of the best things we've ever made, man.

809
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,290
All right, right now we're onto the next one.

810
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:31,092
Got the pancake art, time to eat it

811
00:18:31,092 --> 00:18:32,424
and I gotta say, man, this is probably

812
00:18:32,424 --> 00:18:34,511
the crispiest pancake art we've ever made, man.

813
00:18:34,511 --> 00:18:36,951
- I know, it's about to break into ten pieces

814
00:18:36,951 --> 00:18:38,344
just as I hold it right now.

815
00:18:38,344 --> 00:18:40,245
- Dude, I don't even know if I can get mine up, bro.

816
00:18:40,245 --> 00:18:41,078
Okay, here we go.

817
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:41,914
Oh snap, bro!

818
00:18:41,914 --> 00:18:42,747
Look it up!

819
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:45,667
He's coming for us, he's like!

820
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:47,375
- That was a little close.

821
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:48,208
- The leg came off.

822
00:18:48,208 --> 00:18:49,041
- No, it snapped in half.

823
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:50,526
My guy's not necessarily scary it's more awkward,

824
00:18:50,526 --> 00:18:51,848
he's like, yo wassup.

825
00:18:51,848 --> 00:18:52,681
- He lost an arm.

826
00:18:52,681 --> 00:18:54,515
Oh! And you knocked off my face.

827
00:18:54,515 --> 00:18:55,348
- You know what, how about this,

828
00:18:55,348 --> 00:18:56,496
I'm gonna take off his head right now, boom.

829
00:18:56,496 --> 00:18:57,488
And this is what I'm going to be eating.

830
00:18:57,488 --> 00:18:59,321
So Devan, ready to take a bite?

831
00:18:59,321 --> 00:19:00,821
- Three, two, one!

832
00:19:03,205 --> 00:19:04,754
- Wow, yeah, that's really brittle.

833
00:19:04,754 --> 00:19:06,212
- Oh wow. It's very crunchy.

834
00:19:06,212 --> 00:19:07,665
Yeah but other than that, it tastes really good.

835
00:19:07,665 --> 00:19:08,653
We're onto the next one.

836
00:19:08,653 --> 00:19:09,905
We got the watermelon sculptures

837
00:19:09,905 --> 00:19:11,647
and time to find out how these taste.

838
00:19:11,647 --> 00:19:13,366
- Those teeth are insane.

839
00:19:13,366 --> 00:19:14,284
- It's something special.

840
00:19:14,284 --> 00:19:15,117
So, here we go.

841
00:19:15,117 --> 00:19:16,050
Now I'm just gonna use this.

842
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:17,893
I gotta get a piece off, so I gotta find

843
00:19:17,893 --> 00:19:19,937
a way to carve in here.

844
00:19:19,937 --> 00:19:22,147
So, it's like this.

845
00:19:22,147 --> 00:19:23,330
Boom, there we go, man, easy.

846
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:24,176
- There ya go.

847
00:19:24,176 --> 00:19:25,009
- That's my piece.

848
00:19:25,009 --> 00:19:26,719
You know what? Now that I got it

849
00:19:26,719 --> 00:19:27,878
all busted open, how about this?

850
00:19:27,878 --> 00:19:28,711
Whoa.

851
00:19:28,711 --> 00:19:30,336
My watermelon is hallow on the inside.

852
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:31,169
- Oh!

853
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:32,002
Oh!

854
00:19:32,002 --> 00:19:32,871
- All right, look at this.

855
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:33,704
That ain't good.

856
00:19:33,704 --> 00:19:34,911
All right, so let's see how this tastes.

857
00:19:34,911 --> 00:19:36,994
- Three, two, wait, wait!

858
00:19:36,994 --> 00:19:38,368

- Ready, set, go!

869
00:19:54,211 --> 00:19:55,580
- Oh, I couldn't even bite the green.

870
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,413
- Ugh!

871
00:19:56,413 --> 00:19:57,481
- Oh yeah!

872
00:19:57,481 --> 00:19:58,529
- Well, your art looks amazing.

873
00:19:58,529 --> 00:19:59,830
Why would you eat the rind?

874
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,559
All right, right now we're onto the next one.
