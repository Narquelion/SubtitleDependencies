1
00:00:00,543 --> 00:00:01,859
- What's up, it's Collins Key,

2
00:00:01,859 --> 00:00:03,542
and welcome to the Thursday vlog

3
00:00:03,542 --> 00:00:05,747
and also happy St. Patrick's Day!

4
00:00:05,747 --> 00:00:07,610
Turn up, we're gonna have a great time today,

5
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:09,899
and to join me, I have a very special guest.

6
00:00:09,899 --> 00:00:11,377
All the way from Ireland,

7
00:00:11,377 --> 00:00:13,142
I have captured a little leprechaun,

8
00:00:13,142 --> 00:00:15,142
his name is Devan, yeah.

9
00:00:16,743 --> 00:00:19,487
(laughing)

10
00:00:19,487 --> 00:00:21,968
- I wasn't sure, you just said his name was Devan,

11
00:00:21,968 --> 00:00:24,030
I was like "That's not a hype intro."

12
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:25,071
- It's Devan!

13
00:00:25,071 --> 00:00:26,521
- Yeah, what's up!

14
00:00:26,521 --> 00:00:27,724
- Welcome, my little leprechaun buddy.

15
00:00:27,724 --> 00:00:29,884
For today's video, in honor of St. Patrick's Day,

16
00:00:29,884 --> 00:00:31,517
we are going to be doing our very own

17
00:00:31,517 --> 00:00:34,396
St. Patrick's Day challenge, and we really want to test

18
00:00:34,396 --> 00:00:36,428
our knowledge, go head to head right now

19
00:00:36,428 --> 00:00:38,053
and see who knows more, (laughing)

20
00:00:38,053 --> 00:00:38,886
- I know nothing.

21
00:00:38,886 --> 00:00:40,092
- Yeah, I really don't know that much

22
00:00:40,092 --> 00:00:41,367
about St. Patrick's day.

23
00:00:41,367 --> 00:00:42,310
So we're gonna see how this goes,

24
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:43,424
and basically how it's gonna go

25
00:00:43,424 --> 00:00:45,235
is we have a third party (coughing) my dad

26
00:00:45,235 --> 00:00:46,842
and he went up and he looked up

27
00:00:46,842 --> 00:00:48,200
a whole bunch of different St. Patrick's Day

28
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,432
trivia and questions and he's gonna be reading them off

29
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:52,848
and whoever answers it first correctly,

30
00:00:52,848 --> 00:00:55,183
that person is awarded one point

31
00:00:55,183 --> 00:00:57,584
and the loser has to do a punishment

32
00:00:57,584 --> 00:00:59,829
and we have our little punishment bucket right here

33
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:01,715
with these little scrolls inside,

34
00:01:01,715 --> 00:01:02,653
which is kind of cool.

35
00:01:02,653 --> 00:01:03,691
So you have to pick one out at random

36
00:01:03,691 --> 00:01:05,665
and you have to do whatever is on the scroll.

37
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:07,114
I also want to let you guys know

38
00:01:07,114 --> 00:01:08,701

00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:42,605
let's jump right in to the St. Patrick's Day Challenge.

55
00:01:42,605 --> 00:01:44,258
- [Dad] Great, first question:

56
00:01:44,258 --> 00:01:45,725
Do leprechauns get angry,

57
00:01:45,725 --> 00:01:49,330
(incoherent laughing)

58
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:52,830
- He said leprechauns, we got leprechauns.

59
00:01:55,569 --> 00:01:58,487
Do they get what, do they get what?

60
00:01:58,487 --> 00:02:00,374
I'm crying, do leprechauns get what?

61
00:02:00,374 --> 00:02:01,319
- Do it again.

62
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:02,684
- No no, what's the questions?

63
00:02:02,684 --> 00:02:04,408
- [Dad] Do leprechauns get angry

64
00:02:04,408 --> 00:02:06,183
when you make fun of their height?

65
00:02:06,183 --> 00:02:07,266
- [Both] Yes.

66
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:09,728
No.

67
00:02:09,728 --> 00:02:11,650
- I don't know. - They get happy.

68
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:14,229
- I've never met a leprechaun.

69
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:15,358
- A little bit?

70
00:02:15,358 --> 00:02:16,324
- I don't know.

71
00:02:16,324 --> 00:02:18,574
(laughing)

72
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:23,749
- [Dad] It's actually only a little bit.

73
00:02:24,734 --> 00:02:26,382
- That's so stupid.

74
00:02:26,382 --> 00:02:27,830
So I just got a point now, so Devan,

75
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:31,231
you have to remove from the leprechaun pail of not-gold.

76
00:02:31,231 --> 00:02:34,451
Just get something out of there and let's see what it is.

77
00:02:34,451 --> 00:02:37,583
- Eat as many gold coins as you can in one minute.

78
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:38,679
- Three, two, one, go!

79
00:02:38,679 --> 00:02:41,346
(country music)

80
00:02:42,647 --> 00:02:43,939
- Ow.

81
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:45,272
- Ow? What hurt?

82
00:02:47,287 --> 00:02:48,370
Are you okay?

83
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,473
What just happened?

84
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:58,500
Dude, you're running out, man, what are you doing?

85
00:02:59,391 --> 00:03:00,808
He's so ticklish.

86
00:03:11,627 --> 00:03:13,105
It's so gross.

87
00:03:13,105 --> 00:03:14,471
- [Dad] What is a shillelagh?

88
00:03:14,471 --> 00:03:15,304
Is it like a,

89
00:03:15,304 --> 00:03:16,137
- [Dad] A:

90
00:03:16,137 --> 00:03:17,054
- Oh, okay.

91
00:03:19,529 --> 00:03:21,315
- [Dad] There's four choices.

92
00:03:21,315 --> 00:03:23,315
- I know, what are they?

93
00:03:25,353 --> 00:03:27,542
- [Dad] A: A big stick.

94
00:03:27,542 --> 00:03:29,375
B: A four leaf clover.

95
00:03:30,651 --> 00:03:32,234
C: A pot belly pig.

96
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:35,708
D: A mode of transportation.

97
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:38,215
- I think it's a big stick.

98
00:03:38,215 --> 00:03:39,279
- I think it's D.

99
00:03:39,279 --> 00:03:40,670
- Final answer, big stick.

100
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:41,851
Is it?

101
00:03:41,851 --> 00:03:43,058
- It's a big stick?

102
00:03:43,058 --> 00:03:44,738
- I was totally joking.

103
00:03:44,738 --> 00:03:45,956
Pick out your punishment, dude.

104
00:03:45,956 --> 00:03:46,789
- Alright.

105
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:48,549
Get pinched in the cheeks, aw.

106
00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:49,793
- By me.

107
00:03:49,793 --> 00:03:54,037
(record scratching) (laughing)

108
00:03:54,037 --> 00:03:54,954
Bro, chill!

109
00:03:56,857 --> 00:04:00,440
Oh my god, you were way too ready for that.

110
00:04:04,627 --> 00:04:05,960
Oh my god, dude.

111
00:04:06,873 --> 00:04:08,915
There was no hesitation.

112
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:12,018
You saw that, you were like "This can only mean one thing!"

113
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:13,704
Alright, here we go.

114
00:04:13,704 --> 00:04:15,454
Boop, boop, and then,

115
00:04:19,127 --> 00:04:22,036
alright, and then stand up, you asked for it, bro.

116
00:04:22,036 --> 00:04:23,052
- I did not ask.

117
00:04:23,052 --> 00:04:24,721
- You did, you literally stood up

118
00:04:24,721 --> 00:04:26,565
and put it right in my face dude.

119
00:04:26,565 --> 00:04:29,576
- If you want to do it, I mean go for it.

120
00:04:29,576 --> 00:04:31,932
- Now you're making this really awkward, bro.

121
00:04:31,932 --> 00:04:33,547
I don't necessarily,

122
00:04:33,547 --> 00:04:36,686
- I don't either, man, it's up to you.

123
00:04:36,686 --> 00:04:38,201
- This is so bad.

124
00:04:38,201 --> 00:04:39,723
We're flipping a chocolate coin to find out

125
00:04:39,723 --> 00:04:41,448
whether or not I'm gonna pinch his butt.

126
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:42,607
- That's the easy way out. - What do you want?

127
00:04:42,607 --> 00:04:43,750
- That's the easy way out.

128
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,448
- Heads or tails, which one's your butt, heads or tails?

129
00:04:45,448 --> 00:04:47,346
- Tails. - Tails is butt, of course.

130
00:04:47,346 --> 00:04:48,416
Flip it.

131
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:50,924
Heads, so I don't have to pinch your butt, congratulations.

132
00:04:50,924 --> 00:04:52,271
- Oh thank goodness.

133
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:54,709
- Yep, okay, that was close.

134
00:04:54,709 --> 00:04:56,356
Alright, so let's go, next question.

135
00:04:56,356 --> 00:04:59,673
- [Dad] The official emblem of Ireland is?

136
00:04:59,673 --> 00:05:01,197
There's four choices.

137
00:05:01,197 --> 00:05:03,447
(laughing)

138
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,119
A: The shamrock.

139
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:07,544
B: The harp.

140
00:05:07,544 --> 00:05:09,704
C: The Barley Stone.

141
00:05:09,704 --> 00:05:11,597
D: The leprechaun.

142
00:05:11,597 --> 00:05:13,839
- The lepre, no, no, stop, I know it's not, sorry.

143
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:14,827
- The shamrock.

144
00:05:14,827 --> 00:05:17,198
- No it's not, it's the barley, the sharley, the darley.

145
00:05:17,198 --> 00:05:20,861
- I'm going with A, whatever A was.

146
00:05:20,861 --> 00:05:23,289
- C, what C, I'm going with answer number C.

147
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:24,519
- [Dad] A is the shamrock.

148
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:25,770
- Yes. - [Dad] Wrong.

149
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:26,603
- What? - What?

150
00:05:26,603 --> 00:05:27,915
- C is the barley stone.

151
00:05:27,915 --> 00:05:29,772
- [Woman] Blarney. - [Dad] Blarney.

152
00:05:29,772 --> 00:05:32,613
(laughing)

153
00:05:32,613 --> 00:05:34,507
- Blarney. - [Dad] The Blarney stone.

154
00:05:34,507 --> 00:05:35,340
Wrong.

155
00:05:37,044 --> 00:05:38,501
- Oh, what was it, was it the leprechaun?

156
00:05:38,501 --> 00:05:40,292
- [Dad] It's between the leprechaun and the harp.

157
00:05:40,292 --> 00:05:41,406
- It's gotta be the harp, it's the harp,

158
00:05:41,406 --> 00:05:42,412
it's gotta be the harp.

159
00:05:42,412 --> 00:05:43,847
Leprechaun's just kind of weird.

160
00:05:43,847 --> 00:05:46,183
- It's gotta be the harp, it is not the expected answer.

161
00:05:46,183 --> 00:05:47,325
- What is it?

162
00:05:47,325 --> 00:05:48,451
- [Dad] It's the harp.

163
00:05:48,451 --> 00:05:49,724
- Whatever this is, we'll do it together.

164
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:50,717
We'll both take the punishment

165
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:51,963
cause we didn't know what it was.

166
00:05:51,963 --> 00:05:53,381
Peel a potato as fast as possible.

167
00:05:53,381 --> 00:05:54,885
So that was the initial punishment.

168
00:05:54,885 --> 00:05:56,290
But since we're gonna be doing this,

169
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,616
we're gonna take the challenge up to another level

170
00:05:58,616 --> 00:05:59,754
so what's gonna happen,

171
00:05:59,754 --> 00:06:00,685
we each have our own peelers right here

172
00:06:00,685 --> 00:06:02,022
- Woah, woah, woah.

173
00:06:02,022 --> 00:06:04,217
- Yours is smaller. - Oh yeah, nevermind.

174
00:06:04,217 --> 00:06:06,357
- I'm trying to give you somewhat of an advantage here.

175
00:06:06,357 --> 00:06:08,198
Here's what's gonna happen, we have to peel our potatoes

176
00:06:08,198 --> 00:06:10,560
as fast as possible, whoever peels the full potato first,

177
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,582
that person wins and the loser has to take a bite

178
00:06:12,582 --> 00:06:14,292
out of their fully peeled potato.

179
00:06:14,292 --> 00:06:15,125
Begin.

180
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:19,411
- I feel like I could cut my fingers off.

181
00:06:19,411 --> 00:06:22,411
(accelerated audio)

182
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:27,708
- You're on the table, that's very smart,

183
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:28,638
you're very intelligent, Devan, the way you did that.

184
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:29,471
- Oh thank you.

185
00:06:29,471 --> 00:06:31,395
- Oh three, two. - No no no no.

186
00:06:31,395 --> 00:06:32,982
- Peeled, I'm done, yes!

187
00:06:32,982 --> 00:06:35,105
- No, I had like two little bits!

188
00:06:35,105 --> 00:06:37,678
I had like two little bits left!

189
00:06:37,678 --> 00:06:41,367
- Alright, here we go, take a bite of my potato.

190
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:43,137
(mumbling)

191
00:06:43,137 --> 00:06:43,970
- What?

192
00:06:45,923 --> 00:06:48,450
Take a bite out of it, don't swallow the whole thing.

193
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,532
- It was stuck, it was stuck in my teeth,

194
00:06:50,532 --> 00:06:52,472
I have to dental floss after this.

195
00:06:52,472 --> 00:06:56,639
It doesn't taste good. - No, it's a raw potato, dude.

196
00:06:58,364 --> 00:07:00,686
- Wait, you didn't say I have to chew it.

197
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:02,000
That didn't work.

198
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,715
- [Dad] When is an Irish potato not an Irish potato?

199
00:07:05,715 --> 00:07:07,184
- When it's in Devan's mouth. - When it's a seed.

200
00:07:07,184 --> 00:07:09,434
- When it's not in Ireland.

201
00:07:10,425 --> 00:07:12,894
- Oh, when it's an American potato.

202
00:07:12,894 --> 00:07:15,041
- When it's a french fry.

203
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:17,304
(laughing)

204
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:18,471
Is that right?

205
00:07:21,321 --> 00:07:23,324
That is so stupid.

206
00:07:23,324 --> 00:07:26,513
- Eat an entire bowl of lucky charms in under one minute.

207
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:27,346
No.

208
00:07:28,612 --> 00:07:30,613
- And you know what Devan, this a matter of fate

209
00:07:30,613 --> 00:07:31,985
that you did get this one

210
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:33,517
because you're gonna have to eat it

211
00:07:33,517 --> 00:07:35,183
out of the bowl that you spit all your,

212
00:07:35,183 --> 00:07:36,609
- We don't have another bowl? - No.

213
00:07:36,609 --> 00:07:38,399
- We don't have another bowl? - This is the only bowl.

214
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:40,474
- You're telling me we have only one bowl.

215
00:07:40,474 --> 00:07:41,969
- I am telling you we have only one bowl.

216
00:07:41,969 --> 00:07:43,686
- In our entire house? - This is it,

217
00:07:43,686 --> 00:07:46,048
this the only bowl in the neighborhood,

218
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:47,774
quite even possibly in the town.

219
00:07:47,774 --> 00:07:49,088
Looks like you're gonna have to make do

220
00:07:49,088 --> 00:07:51,890
with what could be turd or chocolate, you never know.

221
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:53,568
We've got Lucky Charms right here.

222
00:07:53,568 --> 00:07:55,096
I am feeling lucky.

223
00:07:55,096 --> 00:07:56,540
(laughing)

224
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,790
- You are apparently lucky.

225
00:08:00,141 --> 00:08:02,180
This is how I do my cereal.

226
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,562
- Did you see like, what the heck?

227
00:08:04,562 --> 00:08:07,525
You act like you've never poured a bowl of cereal before.

228
00:08:07,525 --> 00:08:09,587
You have one minute to eat this whole thing.

229
00:08:09,587 --> 00:08:11,069
- Oh I have, the whole thing?

230
00:08:11,069 --> 00:08:13,516
- Did you not read it?

231
00:08:13,516 --> 00:08:15,517
- I kind of glossed over it when I saw I had to eat

232
00:08:15,517 --> 00:08:18,082
my own chocolate that I already spit out.

233
00:08:18,082 --> 00:08:20,195
- Okay, here we go, go.

234
00:08:20,195 --> 00:08:22,478
His mustache has gotten,

235
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:25,919
the mustache is like right in his mouth.

236
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,976
He's literally eating his mustache, oh my god.

237
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:31,636
Bro, I don't want to be close to you, take your mustache,

238
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,394
(screaming)

239
00:08:33,394 --> 00:08:36,644
Take it, dude, my god bro, no, stop it!

240
00:08:38,486 --> 00:08:41,569
- I just wanted a hug, what the heck?

241
00:08:42,602 --> 00:08:43,435
Oh my god.

242
00:08:44,953 --> 00:08:45,952
No hug?

243
00:08:45,952 --> 00:08:46,952
- No, no no!

244
00:08:48,521 --> 00:08:50,771
- [Dad] This is a question.

245
00:08:51,757 --> 00:08:53,507
- Okay. (laughing)

246
00:08:53,507 --> 00:08:56,065
As opposed to an answer?

247
00:08:56,065 --> 00:08:57,455
- That is shocking.

248
00:08:57,455 --> 00:08:58,339
- Can't believe it.

249
00:08:58,339 --> 00:09:01,106
- [Dad] Why can't you borrow money from a leprechaun?

250
00:09:01,106 --> 00:09:03,106
- Because they got none.

251
00:09:04,356 --> 00:09:05,815
Because they're too small.

252
00:09:05,815 --> 00:09:09,209
- Because they're a little broke.

253
00:09:09,209 --> 00:09:12,959
Because they're a little short at the moment.

254
00:09:14,377 --> 00:09:15,805
- They're short?

255
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:19,499
Alright, drink green water till your tongue is green.

256
00:09:19,499 --> 00:09:20,397
- What?

257
00:09:20,397 --> 00:09:22,611
Oh, we have food coloring.

258
00:09:22,611 --> 00:09:23,444
- No.

259
00:09:24,681 --> 00:09:27,185
No, it's gonna turn my teeth green.

260
00:09:27,185 --> 00:09:29,735
- I'll do this with you, I'll do this with you.

261
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,445
Whoever gets their tongue to turn green first

262
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:33,152
doesn't have to drink the entire thing, go.

263
00:09:33,152 --> 00:09:33,985
- What?

264
00:09:35,764 --> 00:09:39,014
(inquisitive grunting)

265
00:09:42,326 --> 00:09:44,576
(laughing)

266
00:09:47,692 --> 00:09:50,775
(insistent grunting)

267
00:09:56,358 --> 00:09:57,858
- Dude, literally,

268
00:10:02,119 --> 00:10:04,088
you just took like the most highly concentrated

269
00:10:04,088 --> 00:10:06,746
food coloring in the world and put it directly

270
00:10:06,746 --> 00:10:07,996
on your tongue.

271
00:10:09,394 --> 00:10:11,865
It's pretty messed up, bro.

272
00:10:11,865 --> 00:10:13,365
- The whole thing.

273
00:10:15,795 --> 00:10:17,121
Drink some more.

274
00:10:17,121 --> 00:10:18,084
- Woah, hey.

275
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:19,448
- You gotta drink the whole thing, bro.

276
00:10:19,448 --> 00:10:21,451
- I know. - I ain't playing around.

277
00:10:21,451 --> 00:10:22,284
Obviously.

278
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,901
Oh, what?

279
00:10:26,901 --> 00:10:28,666
That's in my freaking eye.

280
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:29,499
- No!

281
00:10:31,324 --> 00:10:33,156
Why? I'm freezing!

282
00:10:33,156 --> 00:10:37,323
- No, what, you had to drink it, you can't do that,

283
00:10:37,323 --> 00:10:38,662
you had to drink it.

284
00:10:38,662 --> 00:10:39,745
- Fine, fine.

285
00:10:42,176 --> 00:10:43,832
- What? - I drank it all.

286
00:10:43,832 --> 00:10:44,914
- That wasn't,

287
00:10:44,914 --> 00:10:46,685
- Chill, bro.

288
00:10:46,685 --> 00:10:47,794
Alright, next question, let's do it,

289
00:10:47,794 --> 00:10:49,028
let's wrap this thing up.

290
00:10:49,028 --> 00:10:51,825
- [Dad] What do you call a fake stone in Ireland?

291
00:10:51,825 --> 00:10:53,372
- Shamrock.

292
00:10:53,372 --> 00:10:56,273
(cheering)

293
00:10:56,273 --> 00:10:57,523
Yes, I got one!

294
00:10:58,755 --> 00:10:59,984
Yes!

295
00:10:59,984 --> 00:11:00,817
Choose it!

296
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,920
- It says speak in an Irish accent.

297
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,154
- Okay, that's a punishment, really?

298
00:11:10,154 --> 00:11:11,047
- I guess.

299
00:11:11,047 --> 00:11:13,086
- I won one so he would have to do that?

300
00:11:13,086 --> 00:11:14,301
- [Dad] Wait, here's one.

301
00:11:14,301 --> 00:11:16,486
May the dust of your carriage wheels

302
00:11:16,486 --> 00:11:18,819
blind the eyes of your foes.

303
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:21,091
- I like that one.

304
00:11:21,091 --> 00:11:22,978
Eat all my lucky charms there boy.

305
00:11:22,978 --> 00:11:24,191
- It's like a pirate.

306
00:11:24,191 --> 00:11:26,271
(laughing)

307
00:11:26,271 --> 00:11:28,096
- May the dust of your,

308
00:11:28,096 --> 00:11:30,176
- It's a pirate.

309
00:11:30,176 --> 00:11:32,148
- An Irish pirate.

310
00:11:32,148 --> 00:11:33,421
May the dust of your carriage

311
00:11:33,421 --> 00:11:35,970
kick them in the enemy of your eyes.

312
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,053
The eyes of the enemy.

313
00:11:38,053 --> 00:11:39,646
- That's not even right.

314
00:11:39,646 --> 00:11:41,970
- Make up your flaming mind.

315
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:43,637
Make up your flamer.

316
00:11:48,549 --> 00:11:51,234
May I keep flaming till the day I die.

317
00:11:51,234 --> 00:11:52,709
- What's this?

318
00:11:52,709 --> 00:11:56,042
- It's the Irish, the luck of the Irish.

319
00:11:57,295 --> 00:11:58,712
It's my shamrock.

320
00:12:00,327 --> 00:12:03,077
It's my bloody shamrock necklace.

321
00:12:04,563 --> 00:12:08,313
Look at your shamrock hat, you shamrock fool.

322
00:12:09,316 --> 00:12:12,899
- This isn't a punishment, this is awesome.

323
00:12:20,837 --> 00:12:24,587
Sorry, I got a little bit too lit there, boy.

324
00:12:25,918 --> 00:12:27,957
- Well that wasn't a punishment.
