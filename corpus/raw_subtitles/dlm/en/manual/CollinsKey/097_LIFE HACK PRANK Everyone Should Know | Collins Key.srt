00:00:00,262 --> 00:00:01,483
- What's up it's Collins Key.

2
00:00:01,483 --> 00:00:03,058
And welcome to the Thursday vlog.

3
00:00:03,058 --> 00:00:03,987
And for today's video,

4
00:00:03,987 --> 00:00:05,336
I'm going to be showing and teaching you

5
00:00:05,336 --> 00:00:07,353
a brand new, super easy life hack

6
00:00:07,353 --> 00:00:09,019
that you guys can try at home.

7
00:00:09,019 --> 00:00:10,102
And this is also a super cool prank

8
00:00:10,102 --> 00:00:12,276
you can try on your friends and your family.

9
00:00:12,276 --> 00:00:13,806
So all you're gonna need for this, to follow along,

10
00:00:13,806 --> 00:00:15,365
is just a water bottle.

11
00:00:15,365 --> 00:00:16,806
I took off the tag and label on it,

12
00:00:16,806 --> 00:00:19,733
so you guys can see exactly what's happening inside.

13
00:00:19,733 --> 00:00:21,494
And you're also going to need a friend.

14
00:00:21,494 --> 00:00:24,838
I've got my very best friend, my little brother, Devan.

15
00:00:24,838 --> 00:00:26,182
- Hello.

16
00:00:26,182 --> 00:00:28,824
- So yeah, so take the water bottle.

17
00:00:28,824 --> 00:00:30,896
First of all, if you were to tip a water bottle,

18
00:00:30,896 --> 00:00:31,829
what would happen?

19
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:33,160
- Water comes out?

20
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,139
- Well, demonstrate.

21
00:00:34,139 --> 00:00:34,972
- Okay.

22
00:00:34,972 --> 00:00:35,805
- Yay, okay, cool.

23
00:00:35,805 --> 00:00:36,662
So, water comes out.

24
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:38,740
If you can hold the cap for us.

25
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:39,974
And this is where the prank element comes in,

26
00:00:39,974 --> 00:00:41,721
cause Devan you're gonna take a seat right now.

27
00:00:41,721 --> 00:00:43,081
- Okay.

28
00:00:43,081 --> 00:00:44,045
Why?

29
00:00:44,045 --> 00:00:45,840
- And here's how this life hack works.

30
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,518
You need to make your fingers are absolutely dry, so.

31
00:00:48,518 --> 00:00:51,259
(blowing air)

32
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:52,092
Hold up.

33
00:00:52,092 --> 00:00:54,241
Okay, if you put your fingers on.

34
00:00:54,241 --> 00:00:55,074
- Oh gosh.

35
00:00:55,074 --> 00:00:55,907
- They're absolutely dry.

36
00:00:55,907 --> 00:00:56,875
- No, okay.

37
00:00:56,875 --> 00:00:57,708
- Stay right there.

38
00:00:57,708 --> 00:00:59,117
- Yeah, I'm ready, okay.

39
00:00:59,117 --> 00:01:01,208
- And if you turn the water bottle over, like this,

40
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:04,066
you see how the water stays inside?

41
00:01:04,066 --> 00:01:06,071
This is where it gets risky.

42
00:01:06,071 --> 00:01:07,421
Take your fingers, we go one,

43
00:01:07,421 --> 00:01:08,475
- Dude I don't want to do this.

44
00:01:08,475 --> 00:01:09,308
- Two,

45
00:01:09,308 --> 00:01:10,141
- What the heck?

46
00:01:10,141 --> 00:01:10,974
- Three.

47
00:01:12,274 --> 00:01:15,211
The water will stay inside the bottle.

48
00:01:15,211 --> 00:01:16,876
I wouldn't look up right now.

49
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:17,709
Okay, there we go.

50
00:01:17,709 --> 00:01:18,666
I have to be very careful.

51
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:20,315
If you hand me the toothpick.

52
00:01:20,315 --> 00:01:21,148
- There ya go.

53
00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:21,981
- Alright, great, here we go.

54
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:25,064
The toothpick, watch we just take it.

55
00:01:26,261 --> 00:01:27,694
- What?

56
00:01:27,694 --> 00:01:28,857
- Let me see, do we have the pencil?

57
00:01:28,857 --> 00:01:29,770
The number two pencil?

58
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:31,020
Check this out.

59
00:01:34,395 --> 00:01:36,318
And then if I can have the jumbo pencil,

60
00:01:36,318 --> 00:01:37,692
this might not work, I don't know.

61
00:01:37,692 --> 00:01:38,681
This thing's like massive.

62
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:40,853
We'll see if we can keep the water tension.

63
00:01:40,853 --> 00:01:42,897
- Scoot back for this.

64
00:01:42,897 --> 00:01:43,743
What?

65
00:01:43,743 --> 00:01:45,404
And then hand me the cap, really quick dude.

66
00:01:45,404 --> 00:01:46,800
Okay cool, here we go.

67
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,248
Hold it that way, that way it doesn't all spill out.

68
00:01:48,248 --> 00:01:51,202
And yeah, so that is the water bottle hack.

69
00:01:51,202 --> 00:01:53,427
And yeah, if you guys enjoyed this video.

70
00:01:53,427 --> 00:01:54,611
And friend, you can take it,

71
00:01:54,611 --> 00:01:55,891
you can just dump it all out, by the way.

72
00:01:55,891 --> 00:01:56,939
- Okay, just on here?

73
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:57,809
- Yeah, go for it.

74
00:01:57,809 --> 00:02:00,642
(water splashing)

75
00:02:02,317 --> 00:02:03,613
Dude, chill!

76
00:02:03,613 --> 00:02:05,240
Okay, cool, so that is the water bottle hack.
