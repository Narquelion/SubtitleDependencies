1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,500
- You challenged us to make the ultimate

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,890
pancake art movie posters, so let's go! (liquid splashing)

3
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:04,723
- Whoa wait a second!

4
00:00:04,723 --> 00:00:05,910
- What was that? - What just happened?

5
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:06,854
Was that upside down? - I don't know!

6
00:00:06,854 --> 00:00:07,950
I think it was upside down!

7
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:08,783
I gotta get cleaned off!

8
00:00:08,783 --> 00:00:09,616
And now its time to make the first part

9
00:00:09,616 --> 00:00:10,930
of our pancake movie art, wow!

10
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:12,470
- Are you good dude? - No!

11
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:13,680
- You challenged us to make the first piece

12
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,430
of our pancake movie art, so let's go.

13
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:16,520
- Wait you're doing Mario? - Yep

14
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,400
- I'm doing Luigi.

15
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,720
- Hey they're brothers, we're brothers,

16
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,553
that means we're plumber brothers.

17
00:00:19,553 --> 00:00:20,640
Yeah! - Yeah!

18
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,959
Oh yeah look at these swords man these look sweet.

19
00:00:22,959 --> 00:00:25,040
- Boom, there we go nose!

20
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,163
- Boom, classic Collin's nose!

21
00:00:26,163 --> 00:00:29,460
- Classic Collin's knows his nose, you know?

22
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,293
- I nose.

23
00:00:30,293 --> 00:00:31,568
- [Devin] Now I'm going in

24
00:00:31,568 --> 00:00:32,750
for the little triangles on his sword hilt.

25
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,290
- You spend so much time doing the details

26
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,100
which definitely helps out yours in the long run,

27
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,790
but in the short run dude you take forever.

28
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:39,230
If that's how good your able to do with pancake batter

29
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:41,550
imagine how good you'd be at braiding hair.

30
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,488
Imagine this Devin, beautiful long hair braided,

31
00:00:43,488 --> 00:00:45,190
and then he could braid your hair.

32
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:46,560
I really think it would be your new passion.

33
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,642
- I like how your dictating my passions to me.

34
00:00:48,642 --> 00:00:51,225
(upbeat music)

35
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,793
- [Collin] Dude your Luigi looks like

36
00:00:53,793 --> 00:00:54,800
he's holding like a baseball bat.

37
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,240
Is that a baseball bat or his arm?

38
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,140
- [Devin] What, oh its his arm.

39
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,490
I'm gonna put a glove on him real quick.

40
00:00:58,490 --> 00:00:59,347
- Why, is he a classy Luigi?

41
00:00:59,347 --> 00:01:00,840
- [Devin] Yeah he's got gloves.

42
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,983
- Oh, I realize I've never like seen Mario or Luigi's hands.

43
00:01:02,983 --> 00:01:03,970
- Yeah, they got gloves.

44
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:05,280
- What are they hiding under there?

45
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,660
- What are you hiding underneath your hand?

46
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:07,493
- Well see the thing I'm hiding

47
00:01:07,493 --> 00:01:09,100
underneath my hand is a plum.

48
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,777
- [Devin] Wow, Luigi is looking pretty happy over there.

49
00:01:10,777 --> 00:01:12,810
- [Collin] Now it is time for Mario's mustache.

50
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,974
- Have you ever seen the Mario Brother's mustaches Bro?

51
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:16,570
- [Collin] I have not. - [Devin] They are on point!

52
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,520
- Yeah but not my guy's. He hasn't brushed it this morning.

53
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,450
He woke up in a tizzy.

54
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:20,730
He was like "Huh, Bowser!"

55
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:22,765
- [Devin] Right now we gotta do the L on Luigi's head.

56
00:01:22,765 --> 00:01:24,870
- [Collin] I've set a pretty high bar with my M.

57
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,460
You're really gonna have to show some skill here.

58
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,910
- [Devin] You're right. - Your nose is like bulbous.

59
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:29,437
Like you took a potato and just like (splat).

60
00:01:29,437 --> 00:01:31,240
- Its like, that was really close.

61
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,100
You know what I need to do?

62
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,830
I need to put up an invisible force field

63
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:34,990
between these two griddles.

64
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,150
- No I hate when you do this. No no no come on,

65
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:36,983
you can't just, come on man.

66
00:01:36,983 --> 00:01:37,841
- Three, two, one. (machine whizzes)

67
00:01:37,841 --> 00:01:39,050
- I gotta say this looks like

68
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:40,170
one of your best force fields yet.

69
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,003
So how about this Devin?

70
00:01:41,003 --> 00:01:41,980
Let's see if I can kinda break through it.

71
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,287
Here we go three, two, one.

72
00:01:43,287 --> 00:01:45,118
(force field bounces) Ah! - Your fist is too weak.

73
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:45,951
- I have special fists!

74
00:01:45,951 --> 00:01:48,330
Three, two, one. (explosion) There we go.

75
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:49,250
- Where did you get that?

76
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,090
- I don't know if this one's gonna work.

77
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:51,640
I got it, here we go, three, two, one. (explosion)

78
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,730
All right, there we go! You know what would really throw

79
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:54,563
this one over the top Devin?

80
00:01:54,563 --> 00:01:55,730
- What? - An elbow rocket!

81
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:56,930
Your force field's got no chance

82
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:57,766
of stopping me now so here we go.

83
00:01:57,766 --> 00:01:58,599
- I know, that's...

84
00:01:58,599 --> 00:01:59,432
- Gotta activate it like this. (buttons beeping)

85
00:01:59,432 --> 00:02:00,957
Three, two, one. (crash)

86
00:02:00,957 --> 00:02:04,827
(rocket blast fading) (force field bounces)

87
00:02:04,827 --> 00:02:06,010
- Yes! It actually worked!

88
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:08,564
Now I can finally make my pancake in peace!

89
00:02:08,564 --> 00:02:11,147
(upbeat music)

90
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,577
- [Devin] Collins can you guess what I'm making over here?

91
00:02:13,577 --> 00:02:15,810
- Making a fire hydrant because Deadpool just like

92
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,390
swiped off the side of a fire hydrant. (water splashes)

93
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,028
- Yeah, that's it! - [Collins] There we go!

94
00:02:19,028 --> 00:02:20,335
All right, next up we're gonna go

95
00:02:20,335 --> 00:02:22,661
for Ant Man's mouth over here. So he's gonna be like "Yeah!"

96
00:02:22,661 --> 00:02:23,846
Look at that.

97
00:02:23,846 --> 00:02:24,930
- Yeah! Wait a second - That's Happy Man!

98
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:25,830
- You made an oversight.

99
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,610
Ant Man's mask doesn't have a mouth.

100
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:28,443
- Oh, don't worry.

101
00:02:28,443 --> 00:02:30,100
We'll do some construction around it.

102
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,450
We'll add another circle there like that.

103
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:32,980
It looks like a Taco, it's a taco!

104
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,410
He has a taco mouth, but it's upside down.

105
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:36,243
So here's what we're gonna do.

106
00:02:36,243 --> 00:02:37,620
We're gonna add in some lettuce.

107
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,230
Lettuce leaf for the taco!

108
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,063
- [Devin] Good save!

109
00:02:40,063 --> 00:02:41,613
- Impeccable, people will never know the difference.

110
00:02:41,613 --> 00:02:42,446
- No, I know!

111
00:02:42,446 --> 00:02:43,279
- I really enjoy the fact that Shrek's vest

112
00:02:43,279 --> 00:02:44,830
is held together by one measly string.

113
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:45,820
Sorry I shouldn't get that close.

114
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,990
But seriously, he might just pop out of it at any moment.

115
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,700
Time to add in what the Hulk is looking at!

116
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,410
Which is, a baguette arrow!

117
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:52,900
It's what Pikachu is firing at him.

118
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,303
- All right let me do some detail work.

119
00:02:54,303 --> 00:02:56,810
Dude I have no idea how all these pieces

120
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:57,690
are gonna come together.

121
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:58,740
You got really quiet.

122
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,406
What just happened? - I'm trying to focus Devin.

123
00:03:00,406 --> 00:03:01,239
I gotta get my baguette lines.

124
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:03,200
- I'm making you talk as you were trying to be quiet.

125
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,080
I just thought it was kind of funny.

126
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,913
- Sure.

127
00:03:04,913 --> 00:03:05,870
- Gonna finish up Bart's skateboard

128
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,050
and then I'm gonna start filling him in!

129
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,990
- Time to fill in the inside of the lightsaber!

130
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,950
- Hey we're actually using some of the same colors for once.

131
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,490
I'm using it for Bart's pants.

132
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,490
- That's not the skateboard?

133
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:16,010
It looks like a hoverboard almost, like he's hovering midair

134
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,300
which is something I always wanted to do.

135
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,960
It would be way cooler if he's hovering.

136
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,793
- [Devin] It would be pretty sweet.

137
00:03:19,793 --> 00:03:21,300
- I'm going to persuade you to make it hover.

138
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,133
- You can't.

139
00:03:22,133 --> 00:03:23,473
- It should hover. - Try.

140
00:03:23,473 --> 00:03:26,430
(upbeat music)

141
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,100
- [Devin] All right, gotta fill in Shrek's vest.

142
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,585
- [Collins] The thing about Mario is I forgot about his fist

143
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:31,413
so we're gonna do his fist over here like this.

144
00:03:31,413 --> 00:03:32,643
- You can't forget about the fist bro.

145
00:03:32,643 --> 00:03:33,476
- You cannot man.

146
00:03:33,476 --> 00:03:34,309
Look at that fist.

147
00:03:34,309 --> 00:03:35,465
- That looks just like his mustache!

148
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:36,298
What did you do?

149
00:03:36,298 --> 00:03:37,330
- It looks like a hand-held mustache!

150
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,650
Like his fist is holding his mustache!

151
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,630
I'm Mario with a mustache, you're Luigi with a mustache.

152
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:44,330
Mario is gonna reach over and just rip Luigi's mustache off.

153
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:45,163
- Why would you grab my mustache?

154
00:03:45,163 --> 00:03:46,080
- Now I got your mustache.

155
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,446
- So check this out. - Wait no!

156
00:03:47,446 --> 00:03:48,960
- I'll take your mustache, bam, pop it on my forehead.

157
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,793
- Well now you have a unibrow.

158
00:03:49,793 --> 00:03:51,930
- You know what instead of that, we'll pop it on my forehead

159
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:52,920
Boom, goatee!

160
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,380
And now you know the true origin.

161
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,580
I would say it rivals the Batman origin story.

162
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,952
- You would be the only one to say that! (laughter)

163
00:03:58,952 --> 00:04:01,535
(upbeat music)

164
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,968
- [Devin] Gotta fill in the glove for Deadpool.

165
00:04:04,968 --> 00:04:06,300
(upbeat music)

166
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,700
Filling in the rest of Bart just like that.

167
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,700
- Big old eyeballs, oh no, I forgot to add the color.

168
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,300
You know what I'm gonna have to go in and add the color

169
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,480
but it's gonna be a little bit bizarre.

170
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,510
Color's gonna be on the outside of his eye.

171
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,050
- Your eyelids actually do go over,

172
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,120
and there's a little lip on them.

173
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,500
So I mean, that could be that!

174
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,680
- That's exactly what's happening.

175
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,610
- Just filling in his bicep over here,

176
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:23,837
and now onto his pec muscles.

177
00:04:23,837 --> 00:04:24,820
- But the question Devin,

178
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,000
are you adding any detail to the bicep

179
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,590
to make it look like a bicep, and not just a noodle?

180
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,090
- Do your biceps look like noodles usually?

181
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:32,107
- I don't know, sometimes they get a little bit noodleyarms,

182
00:04:32,107 --> 00:04:33,143
you know what I mean?

183
00:04:33,143 --> 00:04:34,120
They look like pastas chilling over there.

184
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,150
Today it's kind of like ravioli,

185
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,700
but sometimes it could be a little bit more alfredo

186
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,533
if you know what I mean.

187
00:04:37,533 --> 00:04:38,390
- [Devin] Not that this is a race,

188
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,917
but I think I'm gonna finish before you.

189
00:04:39,917 --> 00:04:42,640
- Not if I could help it! - And I am...

190
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,648
- No! Dude, now I don't know what to do.

191
00:04:44,648 --> 00:04:45,481
- Done!

192
00:04:45,481 --> 00:04:46,314
- All right you know what it doesn't matter

193
00:04:46,314 --> 00:04:47,770
because I'm just gonna fill in my lightsaber hilt.

194
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:48,680
All I gotta do is the background.

195
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,060
- Now I just gotta let this thing cook

196
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,090
and wait for Collins, Mr. Slowpoke.

197
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,490
- I'll be done very shortly man

198
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:54,380
you have to give me some time.

199
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,950
All right the pancakes are all ready to flip.

200
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:56,783
- And I gotta say man,

201
00:04:56,783 --> 00:04:58,470
mine is definitely falling apart a little bit.

202
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,933
- [Devin] Really is, you want some help?

203
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:01,792
- [Collins] If you wanna help me out just lift it up

204
00:05:01,792 --> 00:05:02,625
All under control here.

205
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:03,774
- There we go, there we go.

206
00:05:03,774 --> 00:05:04,607
- Just gonna kind of lift it up,

207
00:05:04,607 --> 00:05:05,754
gonna pat it from the bottom

208
00:05:05,754 --> 00:05:06,587
with a little patty on the bottom.

209
00:05:06,587 --> 00:05:07,634
- You ready? - Holy cow!

210
00:05:07,634 --> 00:05:08,507
- Which way are we flipping this?

211
00:05:08,507 --> 00:05:09,340
- So we're gonna flip it straight over like this.

212
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,173
- That way.

213
00:05:10,173 --> 00:05:11,006
- Three, two, one!

214
00:05:13,126 --> 00:05:13,959
- No!

215
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,809
The big reveal! - Are you ready? Here we go.

216
00:05:16,809 --> 00:05:17,874
- Three, two, one!

217
00:05:17,874 --> 00:05:19,181
(triumphant music) Ta-da!

218
00:05:19,181 --> 00:05:20,810
- Yo, it's a masterpiece!

219
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:21,680
- [Devin] It looks great!

220
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,133
- [Collins] Look at it, the baguette, Hulk's face!

221
00:05:23,133 --> 00:05:23,966
- [Devin] I know.

222
00:05:23,966 --> 00:05:25,650
- [Collins] Mario, his hands, I gotta say

223
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,390
- The colors man, nicely done! - Thank you man!

224
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,580
Yours is gonna have a very difficult time beating this one.

225
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,410
- I think I actually need to flip it right now

226
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:32,737
or else it might not turn out so good.

227
00:05:32,737 --> 00:05:34,501
All right you ready for this?

228
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:35,347
Here we go.

229
00:05:35,347 --> 00:05:36,180
- Do you need help with this or you got it?

230
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,100
- I think I got it. - Three, two, one!

231
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,766
- [Collins] Oh! - [Devin] Did it fall off?

232
00:05:40,766 --> 00:05:41,599
- No it didn't!

233
00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:42,913
That scared me so bad bro!

234
00:05:44,376 --> 00:05:46,662
- All right, here we go! - Three, two, one!

235
00:05:46,662 --> 00:05:48,318
(triumphant music) Ta-da!

236
00:05:48,318 --> 00:05:49,900
- [Collins] Oh my god!

237
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,210
And remember we are making a giant pancake movie art poster.

238
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:53,690
This is only one piece of it so stick around

239
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:54,593
to see what the whole thing looks like!

240
00:05:54,593 --> 00:05:56,550
Time to make the next piece of our movie art!

241
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:57,850
Devin is taller than I am,

242
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,150
apparently he needs a booster seat?!

243
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,610
- To help me get the right vantage point.

244
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,443
- [Collins] We're gonna have the top

245
00:06:01,443 --> 00:06:02,750
of Pikachu's head over here like this.

246
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,980
I'm gonna do Peach's outline over here, a dress.

247
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,683
Looks like a lima bean. - [Devin] Yeah what is that?

248
00:06:06,683 --> 00:06:08,410
I never really noticed how SpongeBob's teeth looked.

249
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,243
They look awesome!

250
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:10,570
- Next up I gotta add a gadget right here,

251
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,223
but based on sound effects you gotta guess what it is

252
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,900
(hissing, pulsating hum)

253
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:14,733
- I have no clue.

254
00:06:14,733 --> 00:06:16,800
- Does this help you figure it, oh, it's not on.

255
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,340
- Oh! There we go! - Yeah, oh a lightsaber!

256
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,445
- Yeah exactly man this thing is like super cool

257
00:06:21,445 --> 00:06:23,497
- Whoa, oopsie that's, sorry.

258
00:06:23,497 --> 00:06:24,640
- Put it away! - All right here we go.

259
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,473
Turn that off.

260
00:06:25,473 --> 00:06:26,610
- [Devin] Now I gotta fill in SpongeBob's tongue

261
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:27,443
- [Collins] Rest of the body over there

262
00:06:27,443 --> 00:06:28,540
- [Devin] Dude what are you making?

263
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,430
- This is supposed to be his arm!

264
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,263
- That's a he?

265
00:06:30,263 --> 00:06:31,720
Now I'm gonna move on to doing his nose

266
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,450
- [Collins] He looks like your guy got a little pickle nose.

267
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:36,080
- He does dude, SpongeBob's got a pickle nose!

268
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,100
- All right well as you do his nose,

269
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,780
time for me to add some detail here.

270
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:39,613
- [Devin] Nice!

271
00:06:39,613 --> 00:06:40,446
- [Collins] some abdominal muscles!

272
00:06:40,446 --> 00:06:41,740
What do you think about these abs?

273
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,627
- Ten? - He's got a ten-pack.

274
00:06:42,627 --> 00:06:44,150
- That's a ten-pack, wow.

275
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,210
- Those ones got separated at birth.

276
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:46,350
- Twelve, all right. (laughter)

277
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,600
Doing three little freckles on him.

278
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,970
- Rather adorable and unfortunately,

279
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,960
your art is looking pretty saucy compared to mine.

280
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,674
My guy, he's got some green hair, some squiggly strands,

281
00:06:52,674 --> 00:06:54,920
It actually was inspired by your hair.

282
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,700
Especially that hair right there, I mean, to me,

283
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,490
that really represents this one right here.

284
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,450
I'm basically basing this whole character off of you.

285
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:02,190
- [Devin] Well SpongeBob doesn't have any hair,

286
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,770
and that was inspired by you, Collins.

287
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:05,619
- Oh thanks, yeah, bald Collins!

288
00:07:05,619 --> 00:07:07,093
Gotta respect a bald man!

289
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,300
Just gonna add a mouth to princess lima bean like this.

290
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,090
Is that Shrek or a snail, Devin?

291
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:12,410
- [Devin] They actually are pretty close.

292
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:13,400
- [Collins] Gonna make Pikachu's little mouth

293
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,026
over here first, like Yeah!

294
00:07:15,026 --> 00:07:16,180
- Ohhh I messed up. - What?

295
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,640
- [Devin] I added a brown line instead of a black line!

296
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,830
- That's a major disqualification.

297
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:20,900
- You can't disqualify me!

298
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,210
- I cannot put Hulk's head here

299
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:23,410
because that's gonna have to be on the next part

300
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,160
of the poster, so instead, I have to figure out

301
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,590
how to elongate his chest.

302
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,020
- [Devin] Dude you are so far ahead!

303
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,675
I gotta start Cinderella and Goku ASAP!

304
00:07:30,675 --> 00:07:32,650
(upbeat music)

305
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,530
Gotta use some blue to fill in this part.

306
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:35,580
- [Collins] Next up we got Pikachu's body,

307
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,900
but first we got arm number one over here

308
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,733
- [Devin] Wait a second!

309
00:07:37,733 --> 00:07:38,566
- [Collins] Then we got arm number 2 over here

310
00:07:38,566 --> 00:07:40,560
- [Devin] Wait a second, those are two bananas!

311
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,801
- No they're not bananas! - Yes, yes, they are.

312
00:07:41,801 --> 00:07:42,634
- No they're not bananas.

313
00:07:42,634 --> 00:07:43,517
- Look at them, they look like bananas!

314
00:07:43,517 --> 00:07:44,950
- [Devin] All right, doing Goku's hair!

315
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,080
- [Collins] It does not look like hair Devin,

316
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,020
it looks like his head is on fire!

317
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,700
See Devin, this is hair, (flame ignites) this is fire.

318
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,000
- Whoa! All right then!

319
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,230
Do you not feel that at all?

320
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:53,778
- It's a little warm but here's the cool thing man

321
00:07:53,778 --> 00:07:55,410
we can just turn off like this. (finger snap)

322
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,312
- Okay, that didn't. - Come on (finger snap)

323
00:07:57,312 --> 00:07:58,633
Okay, nope that's not it.

324
00:07:58,633 --> 00:08:00,193
- That's the whole face. - Should I be leaving?

325
00:08:00,193 --> 00:08:02,298
- That is the whole face. - How do we get this off?

326
00:08:02,298 --> 00:08:04,268
- (finger snap) All right that's the body, okay.

327
00:08:04,268 --> 00:08:05,734
- (hands clapping) There we go, all right back to normal.

328
00:08:05,734 --> 00:08:06,567
- Nice.

329
00:08:06,567 --> 00:08:08,010
- [Devin] Putting on Goku's shirt right here.

330
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:10,020
- [Collins] Unfortunately, my Hulk is not quite the same

331
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,630
level of physique, even though Hulk is supposed

332
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:12,730
to be buffer than Goku.

333
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:15,160
- You do have a twelve-pack, and I'm pretty sure

334
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,117
Goku doesn't have a twelve-pack.

335
00:08:16,117 --> 00:08:16,950
- Uh, a thirteen-pack.

336
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,418
There's two little extra ones right there.

337
00:08:18,418 --> 00:08:21,288
(dribbling)

338
00:08:21,288 --> 00:08:22,680
- All right here we go. - It's not coming out!

339
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,700
- It's all hand strength, Devin.

340
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,850
You wanna get hand workouts like this.

341
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:26,250
You just gotta squeeze into a fist like this,

342
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,083
and then when you extend it. (laser zaps)

343
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,190
There ya go, you get bigger hands!

344
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:31,190
- Yeah, an eight-pack on your hand!

345
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:33,637
All right Goku's hair has to have some yellow now

346
00:08:33,637 --> 00:08:34,830
- [Collins] Forget Goku's hair!

347
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,730
What about the hilt of the lightsaber?

348
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:38,260
It just sounds way more masculine.

349
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,926
Like "hilt" is kind of like "hmm" Whereas, like, "Hilt!"

350
00:08:39,926 --> 00:08:41,536
It's great! - Whatever you say man.

351
00:08:41,536 --> 00:08:43,250
All right, just gotta add this line right here

352
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,840
- I don't think lima bean Peach over here

353
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,760
has been getting enough attention.

354
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,390
I think she's looking a little bit unfinished.

355
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,630
We're gonna give her some little feet right now.

356
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,800
There we go, boom, feet little one--

357
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,680
- [Devin] Wait wait wait

358
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,080
I thought she was facing this way!

359
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,913
- [Collins] See that's the whole thing,

360
00:08:52,913 --> 00:08:53,820
she's like a twisted terby!

361
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,090
She's like "Oh! Heck no!"

362
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,740
- [Devin] Now it's time to do Goku's shirt!

363
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,220
- Why don't you put him in designer clothing?

364
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,533
Gucci Goku is a whole nother level of Goku!

365
00:09:00,533 --> 00:09:01,593
- I actually would like to see that.

366
00:09:01,593 --> 00:09:04,670
This is 900 dollars, what? (energy explosion)

367
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,120
- [Collins] Dude I just realized princess lima bean's

368
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,260
getting like, hit with the lightsaber!

369
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,330
- I know man!

370
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,260
- Look at that face and she's like "Gah!"

371
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,820
- [Devin] I made a mistake having Cinderella be so small.

372
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,740
- Her head is smaller than one of his pec muscles.

373
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,010
Next thing for lima bean Peach,

374
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:17,640
we gotta give her some facial details.

375
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,292
Actually, forget it, she looks perfect. (laughter)

376
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:21,190
She's gonna stay just like that.

377
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:22,900
It's just so beautiful, it's like seeing your daughter

378
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,280
walk down the aile on her wedding day

379
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,178
Just like, "Oh!"

380
00:09:25,178 --> 00:09:26,011
- How do you know what that feels like?

381
00:09:26,011 --> 00:09:29,510
- Because! (organ wedding music)

382
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,070
- [Devin] Oh jeez, look at her face!

383
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,110
- This is me with normal lips!

384
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,637
This is me with Devin's Cinderella lips!

385
00:09:33,637 --> 00:09:35,195
"There big!"

386
00:09:35,195 --> 00:09:37,020
I know how to take my Pikachu to another level, Devin,

387
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,810
because when you think of Pikachu, what do you think of?

388
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:40,020
- Lightning! - Baguettes!

389
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,610
Just like that, Pikachu has baguette number one!

390
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:44,200
- [Devin] Just finishing up Shrek's vest,

391
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,730
and now I'm gonna start adding an outline.

392
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,670
- For my lightsaber we got some white and white,

393
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,080
I learned from Devin, it is actually the best color

394
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,913
for the inside of the lightsaber.

395
00:09:49,913 --> 00:09:51,430
- [Devin] It has kind of like that crackle to it,

396
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,267
like his actual lightsaber.

397
00:09:52,267 --> 00:09:54,190
- [Devin] Gotta get that finger pointing

398
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:55,063
really nicely with SpongeBob.

399
00:09:55,063 --> 00:09:57,870
- [Collins] I love how your SpongeBob is just like "Eh-hm!"

400
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:00,320
- He's like "Yeah!" - "That is my jam!"

401
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,980
Just gonna add a little circle over here like this.

402
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,470
Any guesses of what that is?

403
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,310
- [Devin] It is a medallion?

404
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:08,000
- No, it is a gold medal because she has the fastest feet

405
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,240
in her class, little tappers.

406
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,810
When they walk, they go (rapid blipping).

407
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,490
- [Devin] Okay let me just add a couple lines right here,

408
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:15,530
- Dude you have like a squeak sauce over here.

409
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:16,363
- I know it looks great!

410
00:10:16,363 --> 00:10:17,770
It looks like an impressionist painting.

411
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:19,378
- I thought an impressionist painting is like

412
00:10:19,378 --> 00:10:20,570
where you take your hand, like impress it on a canvas.

413
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:21,403
- Nope, definitely not!

414
00:10:21,403 --> 00:10:22,820
Filling in Shrek's vest!

415
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,653
- [Collins] We're gonna add a little

416
00:10:23,653 --> 00:10:25,390
lightsaber activator button right over here.

417
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,511
This is how you can turn on a pancake lightsaber.

418
00:10:27,511 --> 00:10:28,808
Here we go, Three, two, one. (energy beam humming)

419
00:10:28,808 --> 00:10:29,720
(both exclaiming)

420
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,640
That's pretty awesome right?

421
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,510
- It looks fantastic!

422
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,930
- See the thing is that my pancake art comes to life!

423
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:34,767
Let's turn the lightsaber off so here we go.

424
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:35,960
All right there we go.

425
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,260
- Now I'm filling in Shrek's face with some color.

426
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,740
- Yours is like "Detail City" over there,

427
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:42,400
mine is just kind of a whole bunch of very vague shapes.

428
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,160
- [Devin] SpongeBob's eyes are gonna be nice and white.

429
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,780
- Now time to fill in the "Hilt!" with my black over here.

430
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,051
I gotta say this is really coming along.

431
00:10:49,051 --> 00:10:49,992
What, what's up?

432
00:10:49,992 --> 00:10:50,825
- No no, gotta fill it in with some blue

433
00:10:50,825 --> 00:10:51,658
- That was close Devin,

434
00:10:51,658 --> 00:10:52,874
almost missed a whole bunch of detail there.

435
00:10:52,874 --> 00:10:54,180
(Devin shouts) What, you missed it?!

436
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,013
- Man!

437
00:10:55,013 --> 00:10:55,846
- I've got a chance! (inspiring music)

438
00:10:55,846 --> 00:10:56,679
Gotta give Pikachu a little nose.

439
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:57,512
- [Devin] He is scary!

440
00:10:57,512 --> 00:10:59,450
I'm filling in the rest of SpongeBob's face,

441
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,700
and then I'll be all done.

442
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,020
- [Collins] And bam! Mine is all filled in,

443
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,070
and now just gotta let it cook!

444
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,850
All right here we go, now it is time for the flip

445
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:07,060
do not try this at home!

446
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,880
Gonna use the tinfoil to lift the pancake up,

447
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,140
we're gonna try to loosen it.

448
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,620
- So here we go, I'm gonna put my hand underneath like this.

449
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,450
- See again with oil this would've never worked

450
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:14,283
it would have just stuck, it would have never...

451
00:11:14,283 --> 00:11:15,116
- Okay here we go

452
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,520
- [Both] Three, two, one! (both exclaiming)

453
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,891
- We did that!

454
00:11:20,891 --> 00:11:22,534
Here we go, you ready, here we go.

455
00:11:22,534 --> 00:11:25,389
- [Both] Three, two, one, Ta-da! (triumphant music)

456
00:11:25,389 --> 00:11:26,510
- I can't see it, how's it look, how's it look?

457
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:28,210
- It's your best work yet!

458
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:31,297
- Little lima bean girl, dude, everything came together

459
00:11:31,297 --> 00:11:33,260
and it stayed in one piece!

460
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,170
- [Devin] It looks pretty good!

461
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:36,072
All right, well, now onto my flip, you ready?

462
00:11:36,072 --> 00:11:37,319
- Yeah I don't know if yours is gonna be able to make it.

463
00:11:37,319 --> 00:11:39,073
- So we're gonna do the same strategy here.

464
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:41,230
- Just gotta peel it, okay, it peeled off,

465
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,063
I think I need your help.

466
00:11:42,063 --> 00:11:43,730
- Oh man, I am so nervous right now man

467
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:45,070
- Just up and over!

468
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:47,403
- [Both] Three, two, one!

469
00:11:49,996 --> 00:11:51,662
- Oh man, a big reveal Devin! - Here we go!

470
00:11:51,662 --> 00:11:52,520
- [Both] Three, two, one!

471
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,560
- Oh wait! - 5 second subscribe

472
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,950
challenge, we wanna see if you can subscribe

473
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,250
to the channel and turn on the channel

474
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,590
post notifications in 5 seconds,

475
00:11:58,590 --> 00:11:59,530
you ready, here we go.

476
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:04,200
- [Both] Five, four, three, two, one, done!

477
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,080
- If you could do that comment

478
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,300
down below Keyper Squad right now.

479
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,820
- [Both] Three, two, one. (both exclaim) (triumphant music)

480
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:10,653
- [Collins] Look at that!

481
00:12:10,653 --> 00:12:12,480
Remember this pancake is only one part

482
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,100
of a giant movie poster that we're making.

483
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,470
We'll be putting the whole thing together

484
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:16,460
at the end of the video.

485
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,540
Now it's time to make the next piece

486
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,860
of our pancake movie poster.

487
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:19,810
First part we're starting out with

488
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:21,339
is the flames on Bowser's head.

489
00:12:21,339 --> 00:12:23,250
- Wait, he has flames on his head?

490
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,390
- Well it's his hair, it's kinda like fiery hair.

491
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,580
- Can you tell who I'm making, Collins?

492
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,610
- Oh! That's Royu, from Smash Bros?

493
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:29,720
- You mean Ryu? - Ryu!

494
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,070
- [Devin] Not close, it's Ash from Pokemon!

495
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:33,130
- Oh, I got it, with the hat and everything.

496
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:34,990
Now time to make Bowser's body, and I gotta say,

497
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,512
the proportions are gonna be a little bit off here.

498
00:12:36,512 --> 00:12:38,150
It's not my finest work.

499
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,520
- [Devin] Oh yes, gotta get the Pokeball.

500
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,660
Can't forget the Pokeball.

501
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,690
- We've also got the villager,

502
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,280
you cannot forget about the villager.

503
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,640
- [Devin] This guy is scary.

504
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,070
- [Collins] He's just chilling, he's a villager!

505
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:48,088
- I think he's a villager living in a horror movie.

506
00:12:48,088 --> 00:12:49,638
- Devin, it is not that way at all.

507
00:12:49,638 --> 00:12:51,510
- [Devin] Doing some wrinkles in his pants.

508
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,420
- I don't think wrinkle details is quite the thing

509
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,720
that's gonna take this over the edge, Devin.

510
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,700
- I beg to differ.

511
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,010
- [Collins] The second Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle

512
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,310
is gonna be over here like this.

513
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,170
- [Devin] That's like a bat.

514
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:00,910
Now I'm gonna add some pockets to Ash.

515
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,100
- He's got pockets everywhere he's like,

516
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,244
I got a pocket over here, I got a pocket over here.

517
00:13:04,244 --> 00:13:05,740
- Well he's gotta catch 'em all, where's he gonna put them?

518
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,573
- [Collins] Now I gotta figure out

519
00:13:06,573 --> 00:13:07,740
where Bowser's mouth is gonna be.

520
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,210
He is disturbing.

521
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:10,670
- [Devin] He really does look terrifying,

522
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:11,620
and nothing like Bowser.

523
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,820
I hate to say it dude.

524
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,900
- What, yo, yours is looking so good!

525
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,400
Maybe the nose will help him look more like Bowser.

526
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,660
- Okay, just don't do your normal nose.

527
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,710
- There we go. - [Devin] No!

528
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:20,788
- Just half of the nose!

529
00:13:20,788 --> 00:13:22,170
- All right, half of the nose! - [Collins] Half of the nose.

530
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:23,030
- [Devin] Just gonna do the lip

531
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,170
of his shoe right there, like that.

532
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:26,740
- Now it's time to fill in the Ninja Turtles' face.

533
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,370
Boom, eye number one, and then eye number two.

534
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:31,510
(laughter) He looks very suspicious.

535
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,940
- He's like looking at "nothing?"

536
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,080
- [Collins] These are the back-up Ninja Turtles,

537
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,030
you got "Oomph", and "Bam".

538
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:37,160
- Dude I just realized you're super far along,

539
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,037
so I gotta catch up real quick.

540
00:13:38,037 --> 00:13:39,960
- You can't catch up with greatness.

541
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,490
- I was just trying to catch up on my pancake.

542
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:42,323
- Fair enough.

543
00:13:42,323 --> 00:13:43,156
(upbeat music)

544
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,430
- [Devin] Gotta fill in this big part right here.

545
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,440
- [Collins] Next gonna fill in the finger

546
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,862
so here we go, finger like that.

547
00:13:48,862 --> 00:13:50,260
- [Devin] Look at that knee Collins!

548
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,480
I'm doing Fox's knee.

549
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,610
- You get excited about his knee?

550
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:53,443
- I am!

551
00:13:53,443 --> 00:13:54,540
- Is it a particularly difficult knee?

552
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,350
- No, it just looks cool, just a good leg!

553
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:58,500
Filling in Ash's shoes right now.

554
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,820
- [Collins] Gotta get his kicks on point.

555
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,190
Gonna get eye number one over there,

556
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:03,603
and then eye number two over there.

557
00:14:03,603 --> 00:14:04,436
- How about eye number three?

558
00:14:04,436 --> 00:14:05,400
- That's a really good idea!

559
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,060
My guys got a third eye!

560
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,880
- I don't think I've ever seen a yellow zipper on someone,

561
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,360
but I think Ash pulls it off.

562
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,040
- [Collins] Next I've gotta fill in the turtle shell

563
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,296
on the front of my Ninja Turtle.

564
00:14:14,296 --> 00:14:15,623
He looks like he has a waffle on his belly.

565
00:14:15,623 --> 00:14:17,240
This is gonna represent duct tape.

566
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,450
- [Devin] Wait Collins, did you just say

567
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,210
they have waffles on their bellies?

568
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:21,043
- This is true Devin, yep.

569
00:14:21,043 --> 00:14:22,788
- We are doing the "pancake" art challenge.

570
00:14:22,788 --> 00:14:25,371
(upbeat music)

571
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,040
- Now it's time to start filling in Bowser's face.

572
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,210
Gonna add some red around his eyes.

573
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:32,828
He's been staying up at night thinking about Mario

574
00:14:32,828 --> 00:14:34,820
(record scratches) about how he's going to defeat Mario!

575
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,856
- [Devin] Just gonna fill in Ash's jacket real quick.

576
00:14:36,856 --> 00:14:38,876
- (both exclaiming) I broke it!

577
00:14:38,876 --> 00:14:39,800
Stuff is brutal man. - [Devin] It's scary!

578
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,750
- [Collins] It just comes out of nowhere, it just happens.

579
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,840
- Serves us right for squeezing the bottle so hard though.

580
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,830
- Exactly, you squeeze the bottle, the bottle squeezes back.

581
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:47,580
Gonna add some detail to my villager.

582
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,623
- Did you add a belly button, is that what that is?

583
00:14:48,623 --> 00:14:49,700
- Yeah I added a belly button,

584
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,539
and because his shirt came undone.

585
00:14:51,539 --> 00:14:52,372
- That's not good. - But don't worry,

586
00:14:52,372 --> 00:14:53,400
villager is wearing pants.

587
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,760
Gotta make sure your villagers are wearing pants

588
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,500
otherwise it's a huge HR nightmare.

589
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,250
- [Devin] Gonna fill in Ash's glove next.

590
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,680
- [Collins] Your details are really coming together

591
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,590
but here's a question, are you gonna be able

592
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:02,250
to throw that Pokeball and make it capture things?

593
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:05,160
- No, can your Bowser jump off of there and attack someone?

594
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,170
- Actually he can!

595
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:07,163
- Really? - Check this out!

596
00:15:07,163 --> 00:15:08,516
(finger snap) Boom, there we go.

597
00:15:08,516 --> 00:15:09,492
Bowser's off and... (laser zaps)

598
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:11,238
- [Both] Whoa, oh no,

599
00:15:11,238 --> 00:15:15,271
- [Both] Hey chill, hey, get back here, get back here!

600
00:15:15,271 --> 00:15:16,560
- I guess I got what I wished for.

601
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,643
Now I'm gonna add a nice little glisten to his Pokeball.

602
00:15:18,643 --> 00:15:19,930
- Well if you add a glisten to his Pokeball

603
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:21,750
I'm gonna add a glisten to his teeth.

604
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,410
And I want his teeth to be as shiny as mine.

605
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:27,330
- Whoa that is blinding, oh man, dude.

606
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:30,100
- Yeah, it's the invisilign, it's helped me out a lot.

607
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,490
- It's like a flash light. - I'm sorry.

608
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,600
- You can use that at night, you don't need a phone man.

609
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,550
- It's called a "Mouth Light".

610
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:36,810
- [Devin] Well I guess I'm gonna try to fill in Link,

611
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,900
but dude that "Mouth Light" is so bright

612
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,899
it's gonna be very difficult.

613
00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:42,150
(upbeat music)

614
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,934
Gonna add Fox's blaster right here.

615
00:15:43,934 --> 00:15:46,150
(upbeat music)

616
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,740
- [Collins] There's a hole in Bowser's stomach.

617
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,870
Do you know why? - No, a Ninja Turtle?

618
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,630
- No. You're gonna see in just a second.

619
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:53,970
- [Devin] An eye, a face, a man, a Mario!

620
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:55,249
- He ate Mario!

621
00:15:55,249 --> 00:15:56,660
- He ate Mario! - Exactly!

622
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,770
So this Bowser has digested Mario,

623
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:00,670
but Mario is gonna be trying to punch his way out.

624
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,910
- Wait Collins, isn't Mario at the top of your poster?

625
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:04,270
- Yes, but these are fine details

626
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,320
and we don't focus on those.

627
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:08,071
Yo, dude I got the perfect, (Devin sneezes) you good fam?

628
00:16:08,071 --> 00:16:09,480
All right I got the perfect-

629
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,480
- You didn't even say "Bless you!"

630
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,510
- Bad manners.

631
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,160
Comment down the word "Bless You" right now

632
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,810
so we can all bless Devin because he feels unblessed.

633
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:16,200
- Wow! I feel very blessed.

634
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,170
- Now he is fully blessed.

635
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:18,840
For my guy over here, instead of giving him

636
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,840
a gadget or a weapon, I'm giving him a murse!

637
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,960
It looks kinda like he's holding a giant "B" right now

638
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,793
- [Devin] Or a book!

639
00:16:23,793 --> 00:16:25,450
All right gonna do some gray right here.

640
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,040
I don't know what's going on with your poster,

641
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,380
there's a lot of action.

642
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,070
People are getting hit, people are flying.

643
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:31,180
- Okay there's a lot of action on mine

644
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,200
but bro, you've got a blaster on yours

645
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,548
- [Devin] But there's nothing that's intense.

646
00:16:34,548 --> 00:16:37,850
(upbeat music)

647
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:39,800
- [Collins] Yours is looking unbelievable!

648
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,416
It's all the little details you really elevate it.

649
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:45,232
(upbeat music) - [Devin] I hate to say it

650
00:16:45,232 --> 00:16:46,700
but I really might finish this before you.

651
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,510
- I doubt it man, I think my pancake skills,

652
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:50,150
if there's one thing they are, it is quick

653
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:53,560
and fast and quick in a fast way while being quick.

654
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,150
- [Devin] All I'm hearing you do is talk

655
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:57,170
but I'm not seeing you make a pancake.

656
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:58,370
- I'm making, if you look over here

657
00:16:58,370 --> 00:16:59,203
- Look at me!

658
00:16:59,203 --> 00:17:00,036
- Okay but Devin if you look at me I'm-

659
00:17:00,036 --> 00:17:01,250
- I'm currently making pancakes

660
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,083
- But I'm also--

661
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:03,100
- I can't look because I'm working!

662
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,070
- [Collins] This is unbelievable you're not

663
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:05,773
compromising are you? - [Devin] No I am not.

664
00:17:05,773 --> 00:17:07,310
- Next up, time to fill in the fiery hair so here we go

665
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:09,320
just gonna give it a couple squeezes like "yeah!",

666
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,020
his hair is going to look phenomenal.

667
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,110
Last but not least we'll have to fill

668
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:13,407
in the face color over here so here we go.

669
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:14,650
- And done! - You're done?!

670
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:15,760
- Look at that! - No!

671
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,010
You're not done before I am!

672
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:19,090
- You know what, I could actually help you out if you want?

673
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:21,390
- That would, yes, all right Devin so pick your areas.

674
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:22,530
- I'll go for the background colors.

675
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:25,150
- I don't need help with the background, that's all me!

676
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,540
- [Devin] Going in with a little bit of the background here.

677
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,930
- I still cannot believe you're helping me out

678
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:30,500
with the pancake and all you're doing is the background bro.

679
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,160
There's so much more you could add to this whole thing.

680
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,380
- But Collins yours is so good I wouldn't wanna mess it up.

681
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,820
You did some awesome lines here.

682
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,870
- Thank you man line work is really my specialty.

683
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:40,180
I don't wanna flex but it's my jam.

684
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,370
- [Devin] All right, half of the background is done!

685
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:43,130
- I gotta say for background fill you're definitely doing

686
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:45,462
a pretty shoddy job, I mean, sorry, good job!

687
00:17:45,462 --> 00:17:46,295
- Thanks!

688
00:17:46,295 --> 00:17:47,470
- Villager gonna fill in the face, I gotta say,

689
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:48,790
it's kinda hard to cross like this man.

690
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:49,623
- I know

691
00:17:49,623 --> 00:17:50,482
- It's not the easiest thing ever.

692
00:17:50,482 --> 00:17:51,373
- I feel like we're doing a Twister game, it's not.

693
00:17:51,373 --> 00:17:52,206
- Fill in the villager's shirt

694
00:17:52,206 --> 00:17:53,780
with some yellow over here like this.

695
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,237
- Yep gotta fill in under the armpit over here.

696
00:17:56,237 --> 00:17:58,180
- Yep you can not leave the armpit exposed

697
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,013
that's a big no-no.

698
00:17:59,013 --> 00:18:00,420
- All right here we go the pancakes are cooked

699
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,557
now it's time to remove this thing

700
00:18:01,557 --> 00:18:03,043
and lift it up and flip it.

701
00:18:04,376 --> 00:18:05,880
- Careful with your hands, careful with your hands.

702
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,932
- I've lost it, you're doing all the work!

703
00:18:06,932 --> 00:18:09,020
- [Devin] Here we go, here we go!

704
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:11,053
- [Both] Three, two, one!

705
00:18:11,053 --> 00:18:13,353
- [Collin] No! Not the corner, not the corner!

706
00:18:14,413 --> 00:18:15,246
No, I saw it!

707
00:18:15,246 --> 00:18:16,079
- I think it worked!

708
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:16,912
- I don't think it did! - I think it did!

709
00:18:16,912 --> 00:18:17,745
- I don't think it did!

710
00:18:17,745 --> 00:18:18,578
Here's the big reveal you ready?

711
00:18:18,578 --> 00:18:20,493
- [Both] Three, two, one!

712
00:18:21,454 --> 00:18:22,287
- [Collins] Is it pulling, is it peeling?

713
00:18:22,287 --> 00:18:23,710
- It peeled off some of it!

714
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,113
It peeled off some of it. (Collins squealing)

715
00:18:25,113 --> 00:18:26,557
I think we did it too early!

716
00:18:26,557 --> 00:18:28,414
- You did it Devin, this is all your fault bro!

717
00:18:28,414 --> 00:18:29,247
- I'm Sorry!

718
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,197
- [Collins] All in all I think this turned out pretty well

719
00:18:30,197 --> 00:18:31,560
but now it's time to see what yours looks like.

720
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,893
- [Devin] Now it's time!

721
00:18:32,893 --> 00:18:33,726
- I'm not helping out at all Devin.

722
00:18:33,726 --> 00:18:34,559
- I don't know!

723
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:35,392
- I probably shouldn't help out at all,

724
00:18:35,392 --> 00:18:36,225
I think you got this!

725
00:18:36,225 --> 00:18:37,700
You better not flip it back too far otherwise,

726
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,407
remember what happened last time, it almost flew off!

727
00:18:39,407 --> 00:18:44,407
- [Both] Three, two, one! (both exclaiming)

728
00:18:44,635 --> 00:18:47,465
- [Both] Three, two, one, ta-da! (triumphant music)

729
00:18:47,465 --> 00:18:50,410
- [Collins] What on Earth dude, look at that blast,

730
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:53,470
bro that is absolutely insane. You get to comment down below

731
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:54,580
which one turned out better.

732
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,670
Stick around to see what it looks like

733
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:56,920
when we put the whole thing together.

734
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,430
We've got all the giant pancakes

735
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:59,850
and now it is time to put them together

736
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:01,822
into the ultimate pancake art movie poster.

737
00:19:01,822 --> 00:19:03,990
I've gotta figure out which one goes where.

738
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:05,530
- It is really confusing on your side,

739
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:06,910
but mine is pretty clear.

740
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,300
I think I gotta pick this one up here.

741
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,123
- Oh you're good, you're gonna just pick yours up?

742
00:19:11,447 --> 00:19:12,280
So this one's the bottom over here,

743
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,630
it's kind of like a giant jigsaw puzzle,

744
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:14,980
gonna have to like turn this like this.

745
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,950
The real question is how are Pikachu's ears

746
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,267
and the Hulk's head gonna line up?

747
00:19:18,267 --> 00:19:19,493
- Exactly, that is the real question.

748
00:19:19,493 --> 00:19:22,383
- Three, two, one! (triumphant music)

749
00:19:22,383 --> 00:19:23,216
Pretty flipping close man!

750
00:19:23,216 --> 00:19:26,050
This is like the ultimate Disney plus hero edition pancake.

751
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:27,655
I'm pretty happy with how this all goes.

752
00:19:27,655 --> 00:19:28,740
- Why are you doing it sideways man?

753
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,930
- I'm sorry, here we go, let's just...

754
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:31,010
- Yours is really big.

755
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,720
- Exactly, here we go, just gotta move that under there.

756
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,700
- Now it's time to slide in the final pieces

757
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,789
and see what this thing looks like.

758
00:19:35,789 --> 00:19:37,786
- [Both] Three! Two! - Wait a minute!

759
00:19:37,786 --> 00:19:40,370
If you wanna win a 15 minute video call with Devin and I

760
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:42,950
text the word "Movie" to 81800 right now!

761
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:45,660
So pause the video and text the word "Movie" to 81800.

762
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,120
You'll automatically be entered to win

763
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,390
and lets see how this goes.

764
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:51,585
- [Both] Three, two, one, boom! (triumphant music)

765
00:19:51,585 --> 00:19:53,410
- [Collins] There it is, the masterpiece!

766
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:55,470
- [Devin] It is time to taste the pancake art

767
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:58,222
so Devin we only get to choose one character

768
00:19:58,222 --> 00:20:00,270
so who is it gonna be? - Wait, one character man?

769
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,103
- Only one character.

770
00:20:01,103 --> 00:20:03,330
- I think I'm gonna go for Deadpool actually.

771
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:04,163
- Strong choice.

772
00:20:04,163 --> 00:20:06,185
Yo, because if you bite off the head it'll just grow back,

773
00:20:06,185 --> 00:20:07,040
- Exactly! - so really,

774
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,240
no damage whatsoever!

775
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,120
- That's my thought process.

776
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,891
- [Collins] Exactly, so I'm gonna go for melted Mario.

777
00:20:10,891 --> 00:20:12,670
- Wait, "melted" Mario?

778
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,119
- [Collins] Yeah, his face is kind of melted.

779
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:16,610
- It's kinda fitting because I have Luigi over here too.

780
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:18,410
- Yeah exactly, the brothers!

781
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:19,243
- All right, you ready?

782
00:20:19,243 --> 00:20:21,073
- [Both] Three, two, one!

783
00:20:23,266 --> 00:20:24,317
- It's pretty good!

784
00:20:24,317 --> 00:20:25,503
- Mine's pretty nice!

785
00:20:26,651 --> 00:20:28,620
I think I won this one. - It's like gotten salty.

786
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,910
I actually had like a little life hack

787
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:31,000
where I was gonna pour a whole bunch of salt

788
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,010
in my batter to help it retain shape.

789
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:34,410
Whoa, did not taste very good.

790
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:35,530
So you get to comment down below,

791
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:37,220
whose pancake art turned out better?

792
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,340
If you wanna see another video click right up here

793
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,650
you got 5 seconds here we go,

794
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:44,300
- [Both] Five, four, three, two, one, done!

795
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,600
- Love you! - [Both] Bye!
