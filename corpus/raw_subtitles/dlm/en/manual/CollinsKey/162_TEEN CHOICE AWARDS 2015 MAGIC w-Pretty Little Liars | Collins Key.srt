00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:14,572
- Everything okay?

10
00:00:14,572 --> 00:00:17,647
- Yeah, everything is great, but I just found out back stage

11
00:00:17,647 --> 00:00:20,198
that apparently I put on the wrong shirt.

12
00:00:20,198 --> 00:00:21,031
- How?

13
00:00:21,031 --> 00:00:23,406
- Alright, well dude, this is a live show.

14
00:00:23,406 --> 00:00:25,969
It's not like we can stop it so you can change your shirt.

15
00:00:25,969 --> 00:00:28,518
- I think she said to just take it off.

16
00:00:28,518 --> 00:00:29,351
- There's that option.

17
00:00:29,351 --> 00:00:30,535
(audience cheers)

18
00:00:30,535 --> 00:00:31,368
- Well, you know what?

19
00:00:31,368 --> 00:00:33,309
Tyler, it's all good. Don't worry.

20
00:00:33,309 --> 00:00:34,673
Im a magician, OK?

21
00:00:34,673 --> 00:00:36,590
I got this. I got this.

right here on my shirt.

24
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:42,987
I thought it would be kind of fun to use some magic

25
00:00:42,987 --> 00:00:45,398
to introduce these next presenters.

00:00:45,398 --> 00:00:46,872
