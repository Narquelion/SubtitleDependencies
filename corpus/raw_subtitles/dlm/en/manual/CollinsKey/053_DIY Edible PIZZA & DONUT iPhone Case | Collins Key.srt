00:00:00,201 --> 00:00:01,263
- What's up? It's Collins Key,

2
00:00:01,263 --> 00:00:03,858
and welcome to the the Thursday vlog. Now for today's video,

3
00:00:03,858 --> 00:00:05,442
I'm stepping outside of my comfort zone,

4
00:00:05,442 --> 00:00:09,258
and I'm gonna be doing my very first ever DIY video.

5
00:00:09,258 --> 00:00:11,442
For those of you guys who don't know the lingo -

6
00:00:11,442 --> 00:00:12,699
Oh, that was so bad (laughs)

7
00:00:12,699 --> 00:00:14,741
DIY stands for "do it yourself."

8
00:00:14,741 --> 00:00:16,249
This video is inspired by my friend, Lucas,

9
00:00:16,249 --> 00:00:18,307
and he did a video where he made his own phone case

10
00:00:18,307 --> 00:00:19,881
out of french fries, which first of all,

11
00:00:19,881 --> 00:00:21,935
was delicious, and also, it was a super funny video,

12
00:00:21,935 --> 00:00:23,953
so if you guys wanna watch that, definitely check it out.

13
00:00:23,953 --> 00:00:25,734
I'm gonna put the link down in the description.

14
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:28,242
But today, I want to take things to the next level.

15
00:00:28,242 --> 00:00:31,219
So I'm gonna be using two of the Internet's favorite foods,

16
00:00:31,219 --> 00:00:34,450
pizza and donuts, so if you guys love pizza and donuts,

17
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,033
let me know by liking this video.

18
00:00:36,033 --> 00:00:36,866
Also, I want to let you guys know,

19
00:00:36,866 --> 00:00:38,207
I'm doing a huge giveaway this month.

20
00:00:38,207 --> 00:00:39,594
I'm giving away a MacBook.

21
00:00:39,594 --> 00:00:42,627
So if you guys want to win a MacBook computer,

22
00:00:42,627 --> 00:00:44,681
let me know by liking this video, comment down below

23
00:00:44,681 --> 00:00:46,777
what's your favorite video that I've ever posted

24
00:00:46,777 --> 00:00:50,606
and of course, you must be subscribed.

25
00:00:50,606 --> 00:00:51,965
That was way smoother in my head.

26
00:00:51,965 --> 00:00:53,277
You must be subscribed to this channel. Um,

27
00:00:53,277 --> 00:00:55,097
before I mess up anything else in this kitchen,

28
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:56,838
let's jump right into the video.

29
00:00:56,838 --> 00:00:57,671
To start off, we will make

30
00:00:57,671 --> 00:00:59,201
the pizza phone case and for this,

31
00:00:59,201 --> 00:01:00,534
you only need four items:

32
00:01:00,534 --> 00:01:02,367
item number one is the pizza crust,

33
00:01:02,367 --> 00:01:04,363
number two is the cheese,

34
00:01:04,363 --> 00:01:07,375
number three, pepperoni, and number four, the sauce.

35
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:09,006
You'd be lost without the sauce.

36
00:01:09,006 --> 00:01:10,610
You need to make sure that all the ingredients

37
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:13,191
are prepared before you put it in the oven.

38
00:01:13,191 --> 00:01:15,274
That way, when you pull it out, it's immediately ready,

39
00:01:15,274 --> 00:01:17,742
and you can have a steaming hot pizza phone case.

40
00:01:17,742 --> 00:01:19,525
So to open this up, I don't know how we do this.

41
00:01:19,525 --> 00:01:20,858
I think you twist it?

42
00:01:20,858 --> 00:01:23,838
Don't know, I've never done this before.

43
00:01:23,838 --> 00:01:26,603
This is really testing my manhood right here.

44
00:01:26,603 --> 00:01:28,062
Like, low-key, this is really hard!

45
00:01:28,062 --> 00:01:29,145
Maybe if I squeeze it from the side?

46
00:01:29,145 --> 00:01:30,983
Hold on, there are probably instructions on here.

47
00:01:30,983 --> 00:01:32,760
Oh, okay, I found something, this could be helpful.

48
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,593
There's a little thingy over here.

49
00:01:38,633 --> 00:01:40,091
Well that didn't help at all,

50
00:01:40,091 --> 00:01:41,508
and now I just don't know what the instructions -

51
00:01:41,508 --> 00:01:42,936
Oh my gosh!

52
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:43,853
Oh my gosh!

53
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:46,320
Holy cow!

54
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,487
What on earth?

55
00:01:50,156 --> 00:01:52,939
I don't know if you guys could hear the pop,

56
00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:55,022
it just, like, exploded.

57
00:01:56,205 --> 00:01:57,534
Wow, okay, well that was unexpected.

58
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,867
So I think we take it to ...

59
00:02:02,517 --> 00:02:03,475
Great, all right, so let's see.

60
00:02:03,475 --> 00:02:05,344
What do you do with dough?

61
00:02:05,344 --> 00:02:08,744
I feel like someone like Gordon Ramsey,

62
00:02:08,744 --> 00:02:09,908
All right guys, so if you're gonna be making this,

63
00:02:09,908 --> 00:02:11,342
you have to put the Pam down first.

64
00:02:11,342 --> 00:02:12,175
So we're just gonna lather this

65
00:02:12,175 --> 00:02:13,925
whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

66
00:02:17,614 --> 00:02:19,477
The perfect beginning to a pizza.

67
00:02:19,477 --> 00:02:20,810
So next, you need the sauce.

68
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,685
My hand's all slippery from the dough.

69
00:02:22,685 --> 00:02:23,984
Ayy, I got it!

70
00:02:23,984 --> 00:02:25,759
Okay, so yeah, now we can take the sauce.

71
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:28,112
We do the cheese next.

72
00:02:28,112 --> 00:02:31,704
Ooh, this cheese smells funky, okay.

73
00:02:31,704 --> 00:02:33,010
I'm just going to be very delicate.

74
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,638
We need a little bit more on there, there we go.

75
00:02:34,638 --> 00:02:35,471
And last but not least,

76
00:02:35,471 --> 00:02:36,304
we're gonna freckle it with pepperoni.

77
00:02:36,304 --> 00:02:38,272
This pepperoni looks like sliced carrots

78
00:02:38,272 --> 00:02:39,613
that have gone bad right now.

79
00:02:39,613 --> 00:02:40,713
Oh my gosh, okay.

80
00:02:40,713 --> 00:02:42,071
And it smells bad, too.

81
00:02:42,071 --> 00:02:43,577
So, there we go, there you have it.

82
00:02:43,577 --> 00:02:46,582
That is the pizza phone case right there,

83
00:02:46,582 --> 00:02:48,918
and next step is I just need to put this thing in the oven,

84
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:50,465
so let's see how this goes.

85
00:02:50,465 --> 00:02:51,615
All right, here we go.

86
00:02:51,615 --> 00:02:52,914
We got the pizza.

87
00:02:52,914 --> 00:02:54,622
It's important to have a very low oven as well.

88
00:02:54,622 --> 00:02:56,265
That way, you can, like, crouch all the way down.

89
00:02:56,265 --> 00:02:58,275
It'll be like a squad pic, ayy.

90
00:02:58,275 --> 00:03:00,907
Pizza goes in, and I think we can kinda, just like,

91
00:03:00,907 --> 00:03:02,598
guess-timate on how long these will cook for.

92
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:04,022
It's getting really hot, I'm gonna close that.

93
00:03:04,022 --> 00:03:05,265
I will see you guys in a few minutes.

94
00:03:05,265 --> 00:03:08,182
- [Voiceover] A few moments later.

95
00:03:09,275 --> 00:03:10,374
(phone alarm sounds)

96
00:03:10,374 --> 00:03:12,042
Oh, okay, I guess the pizza's ready.

97
00:03:12,042 --> 00:03:13,347
Wow, it's really hard to grab things

98
00:03:13,347 --> 00:03:14,555
with these mitts on, okay.

99
00:03:14,555 --> 00:03:16,819
Oh, My face is filled with, like,

100
00:03:16,819 --> 00:03:18,128
just burnt air right now.

101
00:03:18,128 --> 00:03:19,673
Oh my gosh, it looks crazy.

102
00:03:19,673 --> 00:03:20,673
Yo-ho-ho-ho!

103
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,611
Okay, right off the bat, I must say,

104
00:03:23,611 --> 00:03:25,192
I think this was a massive fail,

105
00:03:25,192 --> 00:03:27,916
because I don't think you guys can tell how large

106
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,641
this pizza became in the oven.

107
00:03:29,641 --> 00:03:32,669
But apparently, we're gonna make a phone case out of it.

108
00:03:32,669 --> 00:03:34,030
We've got the pizza, now all I need

109
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,385
is just the phone case to make it happen.

110
00:03:36,385 --> 00:03:37,518
All right, there we go.

111
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:39,372
It's like magic; so here's how this works,

112
00:03:39,372 --> 00:03:41,620
you just take the phone case, put it on here,

113
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,513
and then I just kinda push down, I believe.

114
00:03:43,513 --> 00:03:45,477
Ow, it's hot, but this might actually work.

115
00:03:45,477 --> 00:03:47,498
We're gonna start to cut away the dough at the sides here.

116
00:03:47,498 --> 00:03:49,831
One side, this is two sides.

117
00:03:51,222 --> 00:03:53,164
Go for this side here.

118
00:03:53,164 --> 00:03:55,500
Just gonna remove the excess dough like that.

119
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,071
This worked!

120
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:57,912
It worked!

121
00:03:57,912 --> 00:04:01,056
All right guys, round one is a huge success.

122
00:04:01,056 --> 00:04:03,248
Look at that, it worked so well.

123
00:04:03,248 --> 00:04:06,068
This is a legitimate edible phone case right here.

124
00:04:06,068 --> 00:04:07,584
I've been acting super cool like this thing isn't

125
00:04:07,584 --> 00:04:10,498
burning my fingers super bad right now, but it really is.

126
00:04:10,498 --> 00:04:14,025
I'm gonna put it down, but it worked, so yay us!

127
00:04:14,025 --> 00:04:16,067
For the second one, we are creating a donut phone case,

128
00:04:16,067 --> 00:04:18,325
and this is the one that I'm by far the most excited about,

129
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:19,694
and this is a C.K. original.

130
00:04:19,694 --> 00:04:21,190
I've never seen this anywhere else

131
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,889
on the entirety of the internet.

132
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:25,462
All you need for this one is just the dough,

133
00:04:25,462 --> 00:04:27,556
you need some sprinkles, I'm gonna try to balance it,

134
00:04:27,556 --> 00:04:31,723
you also need frosting, I'm gonna try to balance them all.

135
00:04:32,744 --> 00:04:34,495
For this one, I'm happy I did not get the same type

136
00:04:34,495 --> 00:04:36,303
of container as the last one, because that one scared me.

137
00:04:36,303 --> 00:04:37,411
This one just popped out, too.

138
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:38,929
Okay so this dough, if you guys can tell,

139
00:04:38,929 --> 00:04:40,732
is very, very different.

140
00:04:40,732 --> 00:04:42,656
No, the PAM, the PAM!

141
00:04:42,656 --> 00:04:44,780
I keep forgetting to do the PAM.

142
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,613
Take one for the team.

143
00:04:52,761 --> 00:04:54,623
Okay, pooh, it's like a cloud again.

144
00:04:54,623 --> 00:04:56,295
We're just gonna take it right now and we're gonna

145
00:04:56,295 --> 00:05:00,409
plop it on there and then just kinda like the last one.

146
00:05:00,409 --> 00:05:01,858
I'm not gonna comment on what this is.

147
00:05:01,858 --> 00:05:03,409
This is a very special technique right here.

148
00:05:03,409 --> 00:05:04,242
That was pretty good right there.

149
00:05:04,242 --> 00:05:05,428
You need to put it in the oven first

150
00:05:05,428 --> 00:05:07,465
before you put all the other things on top of it.

151
00:05:07,465 --> 00:05:09,126
So right now, my hands are disgusting,

152
00:05:09,126 --> 00:05:10,829
so I'm gonna try to use my arms to grab it,

153
00:05:10,829 --> 00:05:12,541
and I'm gonna put it in the oven.

154
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:14,794
Hey, it's Collins, and welcome to the Food Network.

155
00:05:14,794 --> 00:05:16,449
You're gonna take your pan just like this,

156
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:20,483
squat down to the oven, pop a squat, and then insert.

157
00:05:20,483 --> 00:05:22,749
There's a lot of smoke coming out of there, holy cow.

158
00:05:22,749 --> 00:05:23,662
Lot of smoke, I will put that in there

159
00:05:23,662 --> 00:05:27,829
real quick and um, yeah, so, Kitchen 101 on how to cook.

160
00:05:28,883 --> 00:05:30,025
I don't know, we're just gonna find out

161
00:05:30,025 --> 00:05:31,925
what happens when it comes out, guys.

162
00:05:31,925 --> 00:05:33,295
Okay, this is kind of an emergency right now,

163
00:05:33,295 --> 00:05:34,539
because the timer has not gone out,

164
00:05:34,539 --> 00:05:36,206
but we smell burning coming from this thingy over here,

165
00:05:36,206 --> 00:05:38,063
so we're gonna open it up right now and hopefully,

166
00:05:38,063 --> 00:05:39,313
oh god, no, no!

167
00:05:40,488 --> 00:05:44,701
No, no, no, fire alarm's gonna go off, no!

168
00:05:44,701 --> 00:05:45,534
No!

169
00:05:45,534 --> 00:05:46,523
Okay, I got to get this out super quick.

170
00:05:46,523 --> 00:05:47,610
Okay, here we go.

171
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,653
Gonna open this up, ooh, be careful, be careful,

172
00:05:49,653 --> 00:05:51,374
be careful, be careful, okay, ooh,

173
00:05:51,374 --> 00:05:53,730
yeah, okay, y'all, this is burnt!

174
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:54,647
It's burnt!

175
00:05:56,971 --> 00:05:59,066
I completely burnt this one.

176
00:05:59,066 --> 00:06:00,710
Um, yeah, so this is definitely

177
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,678
a cooking fail for me right there.

178
00:06:02,678 --> 00:06:05,242
This thing is so burnt, but we're gonna try to prevail.

179
00:06:05,242 --> 00:06:06,228
We're gonna see if we can turn it

180
00:06:06,228 --> 00:06:08,637
into an effective donut phone case.

181
00:06:08,637 --> 00:06:10,804
You take the frosting now.

182
00:06:12,426 --> 00:06:14,605
That was unnecessarily difficult to open, man.

183
00:06:14,605 --> 00:06:18,742
Ooh, if I wasn't excited before, this frosting,

184
00:06:18,742 --> 00:06:20,379
this frosting just made me excited.

185
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:22,234
This looks like happiness right here.

186
00:06:22,234 --> 00:06:23,308
I don't know if it's gonna work,

187
00:06:23,308 --> 00:06:25,381
because this thing is rock solid right now.

188
00:06:25,381 --> 00:06:27,742
When I say rock solid, I mean, like, rock solid.

189
00:06:27,742 --> 00:06:31,221
Like, Dwayne The Rock Johnson of solidness right here.

190
00:06:31,221 --> 00:06:34,273
I think that's enough spreading of, ooh,

191
00:06:34,273 --> 00:06:35,786
spilled a little bit, had to take another hit for the team,

192
00:06:35,786 --> 00:06:37,406
man, got to make sure it doesn't drip on the table.

193
00:06:37,406 --> 00:06:40,489
And now, for the most important part,

194
00:06:42,394 --> 00:06:43,517
That was so weird.

195
00:06:43,517 --> 00:06:45,052
The most important part of any donut,

196
00:06:45,052 --> 00:06:49,219
you need to add a ridiculous amount of sprinkles, so.

197
00:06:51,486 --> 00:06:53,556
So I officially used I would say the majority

198
00:06:53,556 --> 00:06:55,818
of the sprinkles on this, but you know what,

199
00:06:55,818 --> 00:06:58,259
it's all worth it and now, all I need is just another

200
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:01,759
phone case, so where's it gonna come from?

201
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:04,488
Yep, just like I anticipated,

202
00:07:04,488 --> 00:07:05,482
this thing is rock solid.

203
00:07:05,482 --> 00:07:07,174
There we go, that worked, alright, cool.

204
00:07:07,174 --> 00:07:09,537
Okay, here we go, for this one, we're just gonna ...

205
00:07:09,537 --> 00:07:11,365
Hey, that actually worked perfectly!

206
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:14,438
And now, we need to do the staple of every single donut,

207
00:07:14,438 --> 00:07:16,998
which is the hole in the center.

208
00:07:16,998 --> 00:07:19,627
No! I think I just cracked the whole thing open.

209
00:07:19,627 --> 00:07:20,460
Did I do it?

210
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,910
Yeah! I made a hole in the donut.

211
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:25,199
The donut didn't quite turn out how I expected.

212
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,994
I think the fact that I literally burnt the whole thing

213
00:07:27,994 --> 00:07:30,842
terribly did not help out the entire process.

214
00:07:30,842 --> 00:07:32,780
And you know, this one didn't turn out to look so pretty,

215
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,178
but hopefully, it tastes pretty good,

216
00:07:34,178 --> 00:07:37,779
so I'm gonna give it a taste test right now.

217
00:07:37,779 --> 00:07:39,862
Ow, it's like rock solid.

218
00:07:41,298 --> 00:07:43,432
If you guys wanna see another crazy DIY video,

219
00:07:43,432 --> 00:07:45,119
let me know by liking this video,

220
00:07:45,119 --> 00:07:46,914
and if this video gets enough likes, then you know what,

221
00:07:46,914 --> 00:07:49,606
I might try another crazy DIY just like this.

222
00:07:49,606 --> 00:07:52,079
I can't even snap, there's stuff on my fingers.

223
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:53,799
Insert snap sound here.
