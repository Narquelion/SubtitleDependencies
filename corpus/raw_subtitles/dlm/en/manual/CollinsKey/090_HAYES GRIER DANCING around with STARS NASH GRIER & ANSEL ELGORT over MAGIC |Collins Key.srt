1
00:00:00,462 --> 00:00:01,785
- [Collins] He's bending it.

2
00:00:01,785 --> 00:00:04,873
Dude, he going to mend it. This is Hayes magic right here.

3
00:00:04,873 --> 00:00:05,813
- What you got?

4
00:00:05,813 --> 00:00:07,752
- [Guy] Hayes Magic 2.0, let's see.

5
00:00:07,752 --> 00:00:08,832
- [All] Oh!

6
00:00:08,832 --> 00:00:10,086
- [Collins] It's still ripped.

7
00:00:10,086 --> 00:00:11,011
How'd he do it?

8
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:11,844
(beep)

9
00:00:11,844 --> 00:00:12,677
- Stop.

10
00:00:12,677 --> 00:00:13,510
- Right here?

11
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:14,343
- Yeah.

12
00:00:14,343 --> 00:00:15,207
- Take it. Take a look at that card.

13
00:00:15,207 --> 00:00:16,862
Show it to the camera.

14
00:00:16,862 --> 00:00:19,584
(laughter)

15
00:00:19,584 --> 00:00:20,652
Four of hearts right here.

16
00:00:20,652 --> 00:00:21,485
- Yeah.

17
00:00:21,485 --> 00:00:24,192
- Four goes in the middle. Push it in. Push it in.

18
00:00:24,192 --> 00:00:25,922
Push in that five.

19
00:00:25,922 --> 00:00:26,755
(snap)

20
00:00:26,755 --> 00:00:28,081
And snap, look what jumps on top.

21
00:00:28,081 --> 00:00:28,914
You ready for this?

22
00:00:28,914 --> 00:00:31,247
I'm going to blow your mind.

23
00:00:33,108 --> 00:00:33,941
- It was a five.

24
00:00:33,941 --> 00:00:35,358
- Okay, okay, jk.

25
00:00:37,216 --> 00:00:38,631
Bam.

26
00:00:38,631 --> 00:00:40,380
Did I get it? Two, okay take it. Um.

27
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,239
(laughter)

28
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:42,072
- Sorry.

29
00:00:42,072 --> 00:00:43,658
So I'm getting a little bit nervous, screw this.

30
00:00:43,658 --> 00:00:45,155
Hold out your hand, man.

31
00:00:45,155 --> 00:00:46,630
Okay I'll use your hand.

32
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:47,791
Hold it a little bit lower.

33
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:49,416
What was it, five of hearts? Right?

34
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:52,214
See we go through. Five of hearts, okay.

35
00:00:52,214 --> 00:00:53,711
I missed it by a lot.

36
00:00:53,711 --> 00:00:55,185
What if I told you I can fix this?

37
00:00:55,185 --> 00:00:56,184
- Fix it.

38
00:00:56,184 --> 00:00:57,438
- Watch, right here.

39
00:00:57,438 --> 00:01:00,050
Take the five. Hold the nine a little bit lower.

40
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:01,280
And watch, right here.

41
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,511
If I wave this five like this,

42
00:01:02,511 --> 00:01:05,169
I can get the nine to soar to my hand.

43
00:01:05,169 --> 00:01:06,002
Like that.

44
00:01:07,514 --> 00:01:08,780
And yeah, look what you're holding.

45
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:09,801
Go for it, turn it over.

46
00:01:09,801 --> 00:01:11,718
Turn over those pieces.

47
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,306
- [Male] He literally ripped up a card.

48
00:01:14,306 --> 00:01:16,128
- Yo, that's kinda freak.

49
00:01:16,128 --> 00:01:18,543
- I can fix this, I tore up like a seven of clubs, right?

50
00:01:18,543 --> 00:01:19,376
- Yeah.

51
00:01:19,376 --> 00:01:21,236
- Watch, if I just give it a wave like this.

52
00:01:21,236 --> 00:01:23,918
See right there I can get the seven to this card right here.

53
00:01:23,918 --> 00:01:25,868
And then look what you're holding, go for it.

54
00:01:25,868 --> 00:01:26,701
Turn it over.

55
00:01:26,701 --> 00:01:27,934
(laughter)

56
00:01:27,934 --> 00:01:29,037
- [Ansel] I like that trick.

57
00:01:29,037 --> 00:01:31,231
- [Collins] Let me see it. And then reach out your hand.

58
00:01:31,231 --> 00:01:32,064
- Are these pieces about to change?

59
00:01:32,064 --> 00:01:33,867
- Hold out your hand, hold out your hand.

60
00:01:33,867 --> 00:01:35,086
And squeeze tight, squeeze tight.

61
00:01:35,086 --> 00:01:36,363
Nash, put your hand on his.

62
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:37,196
- Woo!

63
00:01:37,196 --> 00:01:39,033
- Daniel put your hand on, you gotta pile your hands on.

64
00:01:39,033 --> 00:01:40,530
You're going to start to feel them heat up.

65
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:41,842
This isn't going to hurt or anything, just tell me

66
00:01:41,842 --> 00:01:43,665
when you start to feel it happen.

67
00:01:43,665 --> 00:01:45,185
Squeeze tight, as tight as you can.

68
00:01:45,185 --> 00:01:46,018
Feel it start to heat up?

69
00:01:46,018 --> 00:01:46,851
- Yeah.

70
00:01:51,269 --> 00:01:52,360
- They actually melt.

71
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,449
I want you to open up those torn pieces.

72
00:01:54,449 --> 00:01:55,308
- This isn't torn!

73
00:01:55,308 --> 00:01:56,632
- Aw man, his hand!

74
00:01:56,632 --> 00:01:57,795
- I saw the five of hearts that was in his hand.

75
00:01:57,795 --> 00:01:58,628
- Watch this, you ready?

76
00:01:58,628 --> 00:02:00,050
It's not going to hurt, but you're going to

77
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,825
slowly start to feel it heat up.

78
00:02:02,825 --> 00:02:04,752
You're going to feel it heat up.

79
00:02:04,752 --> 00:02:06,098
Feel it?

80
00:02:06,098 --> 00:02:06,931
- Little bit.

81
00:02:06,931 --> 00:02:07,764
- Ahh!!

82
00:02:07,764 --> 00:02:09,604
- Yeah they're going to actually melt.

83
00:02:09,604 --> 00:02:10,661
Right there.

84
00:02:10,661 --> 00:02:12,042
- If that's a four...

85
00:02:12,042 --> 00:02:14,794
- Now open it up, open up those torn up pieces.

86
00:02:14,794 --> 00:02:15,794
- Oh my God!

87
00:02:17,394 --> 00:02:18,590
- This is not even...

88
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,696
- That was freaky.

89
00:02:20,696 --> 00:02:22,170
- That's not possible, man!

90
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,064
- It's crazy!

91
00:02:23,064 --> 00:02:25,490
