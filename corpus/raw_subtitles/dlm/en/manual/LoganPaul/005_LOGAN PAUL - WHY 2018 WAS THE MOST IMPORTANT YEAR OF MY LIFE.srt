1
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,200
Where's logan?

2
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,820
Where's logan?

3
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,380
you found your balloon didn't you buddy?

4
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:27,880
hey what's up? that's me, logan

5
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,880
I used to be a regular kid from Ohio

6
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,860
You know i love sports payed attention in school and was always a bit awkward

7
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:45,900
But then when I was about 10 years old, I picked up a video camera and became Logan Paul. and your address? butthead street.

8
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,900
wow your a jerk don't call back again

9
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:53,440
Yup I've always been a bit of a troublemaker. Fast Forward.

10
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,240
**Fast Forwarding**

11
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:02,040
This was me in 2016, which ended up being the best year of my life

12
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:12,640
(Music)

13
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,640
Then this was me in 2017, which was an even better year of my life

14
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:28,040
(Music continues)

15
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,080
So what the Fuck happened in 2018

16
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:38,000
that made the world quiver when they heard the words - *Logan Paul*

17
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,670
Obviously, you know the answer, but let's rewind for a second

18
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:45,958
After becoming one of the top vine stars in the world, Rest in Peace Vine, btw

19
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:50,879
I hopped from platform to platform shooting viral sketch comedy bits. Some of which you may have seen

20
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:58,859
After about a year, I have gained about 25 million fans between Facebook, Instagram and Twitter

21
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,820
And then I heard about this thing called daily vlogging

22
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,480
What is up

23
00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:19,649
People of the internet. My name is Logan Paul and welcome to my vlog channel. That's right

24
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,079
I'm vlogging now you get to see more of me. hahaha

25
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:26,218
I began, my youtube journey with a bulldozed mentality

26
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:33,119
I was gonna work my ass off to overtake this platform with fresh explosive quick pace and outlandish content.

27
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:35,680
I wanted to conquer and destroy

28
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:42,719
sometimes quite literally everything in my path. The bigger the faster, the louder the better.

29
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,120
I wanted to make noise,

30
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,940
So... I did

31
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,540
We became the fastest channel to hit ten million subscribers in the history of YouTube

32
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:13,299
And I told myself that I was gonna blow any competition I had, out of the water which at one point became my own brother

33
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,620
And that got ugly

34
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:37,460
**Chanting** LOGAN LOGAN

35
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,220
And slowly but surely in my endless pursue of more views and more subscribers

36
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,959
It was becoming clear that the vlog mentality was getting out of hand

37
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,200
But, I did not see that

38
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,310
Here's what I saw

39
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:59,500
Oh Mamma Mia take a look around Oh! yoo look so good at night! boy just dropped 40k on a presidential rolex

40
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,840
so how about that vehicle though

41
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:09,879
What's in the bags eleven thousand six hundred dollars worth of Gucci clothes. Oh! is this solid gold, solid gold. twenty thousand dollars

42
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:11,879
It is yours. That's my boii

43
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,929
The machine was beginning to take on a mind of its own

44
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:22,179
As my hunger for success was growing exponentially. So was my ego.

45
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,399
The line for what was acceptable, became more and more foggy and the disrespect began to skyrocket

46
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,720
And it's not that I felt the rules didn't apply to me I knew they did

47
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,320
I just didn't care about the consequences if I broke them. I didn't even consider them

48
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,140
You can't stop logan fucking paul

49
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:50,700
I Wanted to entertain my audience every single day with, out of this world content and behavior that they could only find on logan paul vlogs

50
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,460
Consequences were rarely even an afterthought

51
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,460
logang going to the top

52
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:00,240
And not to mention I was the 22 year old

53
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:05,430
blond haired, blue eyed kid from Ohio with 45 million followers on the internet. Every single day

54
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,580
My actions were validated by five to seven million viewers

55
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,589
and as long as I wasn't doing any harm

56
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:15,570
No one was trying to stop me now my peers not my family not even members of my own team

57
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:25,619
And then in December of 2017 I went to Japan

58
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:32,820
It was the perfect storm of circumstance ignorance ego and downright stupidity

59
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,920
The backlash against the social media star who posted a video of an apparent suicide victim is intensifying

60
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,760
The video viewed over 6 million times in just 24 hours

61
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:49,740
Youtube star Logan Paul is facing the fallout after posting a video that showed the body of an apparent suicide victim

62
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,580
The backlash was

63
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,100
massive people and creators of all sizes

64
00:05:54,789 --> 00:06:01,949
Denouncing Logan Paul and this video actor Aaron Paul saying Logan Paul go to hell so many people sharing stories people they lost due

65
00:06:01,949 --> 00:06:03,959
of to suicide and some specifically hanging

66
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,840
I obviously as a person as a human being I was

67
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:13,440
frustrated and pissed off and offended by his actions a hero for a lot of kids is to logan fans and

68
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,960
when I see that I

69
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,120
Care so much

70
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,530
I'm so disgusted

71
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:29,669
how could somebody not realize how fucked up this is this crosses the line and I am NOT surprised that he would do something like

72
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:32,099
This it doesn't make any sense to me whatsoever

73
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:38,460
As a human being how about a little bit of empathy like a normal human being instead of being a moron go to a morgue

74
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,650
If you're that fucking morbid he thought that that was a cool thing to do

75
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,310
in

76
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:49,739
Less than 24 hours. I became the most hated person on the planet. I

77
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,370
Had made an inexcusable mistake

78
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,859
completely destroyed my image lost every

79
00:06:55,990 --> 00:07:03,840
Professional relationship that I had became the Internet's favorite meme and most importantly had my eyes opened wide to the consequences of my actions.

80
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:16,770
I felt every ounce of disappointment and hate directed at me and while it was a hundred percent my fault

81
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,770
It was critical that I felt all of it

82
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,460
Now here's where I made a significant mistake. I went into panic mode

83
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,519
Being disliked was my biggest fear in the entire world

84
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,599
So in a scramble to try and reverse the past I asked myself

85
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:40,809
How do I fix this when instead the question I should have been asking was how do I fix me?

86
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:46,658
I took a month break from the internet and attempted to bounce back with an anti suicide PSA and a donation

87
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:48,669
But I was still moving too fast.

88
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:57,159
I didn't fully understand the significance of my actions the depth of the pain they caused and was literally becoming my own worst nightmare

89
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:01,419
Pretty much. I know for a fact everything I do from this point on will get criticism

90
00:08:01,419 --> 00:08:06,399
It will get backlash. So internet, please don't use me bro crucify me vilify me

91
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:17,500
As I fell more and more out of touch with reality. I couldn't trust myself. I wouldn't send my team the videos for a review

92
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:23,229
I didn't listen to my friends and I refused to adapt my content. It was the highest degree of self-sabotage

93
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:32,560
But finally after nearly running the rest of my life into the ground I received a blessing in disguise

94
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,840
True Geordie: You said before this fight you have something planned

95
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,360
Is there anything you want to say to someone out?

96
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:46,089
KSI: Obviously man's got this belt right now and if any YouTuber wants it. You can come get it

97
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:52,629
Jake Paul, Logan Paul, any of the Pauls I don't care bring it

98
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,640
I saw this as an opportunity to turn my disoriented emotions into fuel

99
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,000
After everything that had happened since January

100
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,240
This was my chance to truly TRULY take a step back from the internet

101
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,160
and focus on something else with the unrelenting passion that I knew I had

102
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,320
I knew that I had more to offer in this world, and I did not want to let my failure define me

103
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,409
Little did I know, I had been preaching this message the whole time

104
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:26,078
And if you lose if you fail fine, in fact, please let me fail

105
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:32,079
Let me let me lose. If you can take a hit in the face and get back up and learn from it

106
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:38,649
That is a win consider that a win because you are now better and stronger than you were in the past

107
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:42,789
It's just like working out. You work out. You work out. You work out you deplete your muscles

108
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:48,070
You take your protein shake and then your muscles heal and you're stronger than you were before. It's the same exact thing...

109
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,180
During the six months of four hours of daily training I rekindled my relationship with my brother

110
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,020
I fell in love with a girl who

111
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:07,280
Absolutely changed my life and I restructured my business and focused on my mental health and emotional growth

112
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,860
This is weird bro, I didn't think i'd cry right now

113
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,780
Thank God for the people around me in the support of you guys because I don't know how else I would have gotten through this

114
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,780
Year or out of my own way

115
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,180
It is a majority draw

116
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,140
And although the fight was a draw (whack as fuck)

117
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:38,960
It turned out to be the biggest event in internet history, and I'm looking forward to the rematch next year

118
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,120
I told myself at the beginning of the year I was not going to let that become my legacy

119
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,520
and that I was gonna not ask for forgiveness but earn a chance to be forgiven

120
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,140
Have I earned that? not yet, not yet

121
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,260
But it is a start of a new Logan Paul

122
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,700
where every fucking day I craft a better version of myself and KSI for that I owe you a thank you brother

123
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,700
Rematch is gonna be fun

124
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,560
True Geordie: Ladies and gentlemen KSI and Logan Paul!

125
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:22,120
As I've matured this year I've gotten to exercise my creativity in different ways with the number one podcast in the world called impaulsive

126
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,040
A documentary about the Flat Earth, which is coming in January, And

127
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,760
I'm hitting 2019 hard by releasing a show called best friends that I shot with Evan

128
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,510
big things come in small packages

129
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:37,499
An animated storytime series about crazy shit that's gone down in my life as well as reviving the vlogs.

130
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:42,629
I'm growing into who I am and what I want to make versus trying to fit into the mold of YouTube

131
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,999
Personality or be someone who I'm simply not

132
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,910
The things you've been went through this year

133
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:54,480
Have you shared yet on this podcast or on your vlog - three biggest lessons you learned from this year. What's that?

134
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,969
What's the one you share? The one is slow down. It is the first thing that comes to my mind and I can

135
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,840
not

136
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:07,260
Point to that as the reason for what happened the singular reason for what happened, but that is a that is HUGE

137
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,240
What would be less number two the biggest?

138
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,400
lesson of the year lesson number two

139
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,400
listen...

140
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,680
Listening happen what way listen to the people around you?

141
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,780
Listen to what they're saying

142
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:27,300
Listen to your audience. Listen to your friends. Listen, you're family. You're not right about everything old Logan what will be a third one

143
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:34,499
Biggest lesson that you think will transform not only your business your brand your Empire, but also your life

144
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:39,300
In 2019 and beyond I think empathy

145
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:45,480
I think I think being aware of people beyond just yourself

146
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:11,600
Granted I'm still young and I still have a lot to learn and by no means am I saying I've learned everything and

147
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,750
I'll never make another mistake

148
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,250
Because I'm far from perfect and I'm nowhere near the man I want to be

149
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:22,730
But the best thing I can do is keep striving to listen, learn, grow, feel and adapt.

150
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:34,379
Now one year later, although I can't say 2018 was the best year of my life

151
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:39,779
I can absolutely say this has been the most cathartic and important year of my life

152
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,389
This year and how I move forward will forever define the type of man that I am in the mission I'm on

153
00:13:46,509 --> 00:13:50,459
I'm blessed to be able to continue doing what I love and I want to thank all of you for your support

154
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:59,129
and if you're like me and you're ever feeling low, like the weight of the world has been stacked on your shoulders

155
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,979
Even if it is a fault of your own, just remember

156
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,979
It could always get worse

157
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:09,779
But it will always get better

158
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:19,560
Who knows? 2018 might end up being the best year of my life, but I got a lot more to go.

159
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:21,960
