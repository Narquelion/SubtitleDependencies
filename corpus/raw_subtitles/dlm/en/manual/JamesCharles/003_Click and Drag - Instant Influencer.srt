James Charles:<i> Previously on "Instant Influencer"...</i>

2
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:07,240
Hi, sisters. James Charles here,

3
00:00:07,273 --> 00:00:10,076
and today I have something extra special for you.

4
00:00:10,109 --> 00:00:13,346
<i> Last year, I started the search to find the next beauty superstar.</i>

5
00:00:13,379 --> 00:00:16,516
- Lights. -<i> And last week six artists started the competition.</i>

6
00:00:16,549 --> 00:00:18,217
Ashley, congratulations.

7
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:19,752
You are the winner of the first Compact Challenge.

8
00:00:19,785 --> 00:00:21,187
Oh, my God!

9
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,423
<i> There were highs...</i>

10
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:28,327
Our celebrity guest judge is Paris Hilton.

11
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,630
- Oh, my God. - You guys are hot.

12
00:00:30,663 --> 00:00:32,765
-<i> ...and there were lows. </i> - This look's a little bit  more simplistic.

13
00:00:32,798 --> 00:00:34,567
You need a little bit of work with the details.

14
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,171
-<i> But in the end... </i> - You have been eliminated.

15
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:43,043
...only one can become an Instant Influencer.

16
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:48,448
Good morning, you guys,

17
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:50,149
and welcome to "Instant Influencer"

18
00:00:50,182 --> 00:00:51,784
week number two.

19
00:00:51,817 --> 00:00:53,519
It is currently...

20
00:00:53,552 --> 00:00:56,522
oh, my g-- 5:05 in the morning.

21
00:00:56,555 --> 00:00:57,857
The sun is not even up yet.

22
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:59,859
We are not in our normal studio.

23
00:00:59,892 --> 00:01:01,260
We are actually here at the hotel

24
00:01:01,293 --> 00:01:02,628
that all the contestants are staying at.

25
00:01:02,661 --> 00:01:04,630
And that is because we're about to give them

26
00:01:04,663 --> 00:01:06,265
a little bit of a rude awakening

27
00:01:06,298 --> 00:01:08,234
with today's Compact Challenge.

28
00:01:08,267 --> 00:01:10,103
Good morning. ( chuckles )

29
00:01:21,413 --> 00:01:24,717
- Good morning, Benny.  Rise and shine. - Good morning.

30
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,121
- Did you just wake up? - Yeah. I'm literally, like,  in underwear and everything.

31
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:30,657
- Throw on some pants.  Let's go. - Okay.

32
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:35,394
I'm wondering what does James have up

33
00:01:35,427 --> 00:01:36,629
his little bathrobe sleeve?

34
00:01:36,662 --> 00:01:39,165
<i> 'Cause, child, I'm tired.</i>

35
00:01:39,198 --> 00:01:40,800
So I see everybody in their little bathrobes,

36
00:01:40,833 --> 00:01:42,368
and I'm excited because, honestly,

37
00:01:42,401 --> 00:01:45,238
I think we're going to a spa.

38
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:46,873
Right?

39
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:48,875
- Right? - All right, you guys,

40
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:50,276
I know you probably hate me right now,

41
00:01:50,309 --> 00:01:51,477
but I promise that there's a good reason

42
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:54,147
behind today's Compact Challenge.

43
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,783
As an influencer, getting ready fast is a very vital skill.

44
00:01:57,816 --> 00:01:59,585
You guys are gonna be challenged with getting

45
00:01:59,618 --> 00:02:02,722
fully red carpet ready in only 30 minutes.

46
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:06,626
I'm really nervous. I have never gotten ready in 30 minutes.

47
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,528
Okay, let's go.

48
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:10,530
Gabriel:<i> It always takes me at least an hour,</i>

49
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:12,632
so this is just gonna be a little tough for me.

50
00:02:15,801 --> 00:02:17,337
Let's go!

51
00:02:20,806 --> 00:02:21,941
James: Don't worry, you guys.

52
00:02:21,974 --> 00:02:23,309
I've never been in a car accident.

53
00:02:23,342 --> 00:02:24,344
Ha!

54
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:28,581
Let's go! Come on, come on!

55
00:02:28,614 --> 00:02:31,584
Your 30 minutes starts right now.

56
00:02:36,655 --> 00:02:38,324
I'm running to this Ulta Beauty closet

57
00:02:38,357 --> 00:02:40,393
so that I can get the products that I need

58
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:43,529
<i> and go back to my desk and push out a bomb look.</i>

59
00:02:43,562 --> 00:02:45,798
- Ah. Here we go. - Because I know that  I can get this done,

60
00:02:45,831 --> 00:02:46,866
and I know that I can win this challenge.

61
00:02:50,302 --> 00:02:52,838
I think I'm just gonna apply my foundation with my fingers

62
00:02:52,871 --> 00:02:54,540
'cause I do not want to waste any time.

63
00:02:54,573 --> 00:02:55,975
Indigo:<i> I have never gotten ready</i>

64
00:02:56,008 --> 00:02:57,977
<i> in 30 minutes in my entire life,</i>

65
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:00,813
so my best strategy is to literally just slap on my base

66
00:03:00,846 --> 00:03:02,915
<i> so I can focus on my eyes.</i>

67
00:03:02,948 --> 00:03:05,851
I'm going to let my eyes do all the talking from here on out.

68
00:03:05,884 --> 00:03:08,287
<i> Nothing else.</i>

69
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,656
Way too early for this.

70
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:13,860
Oh, my God. Way too much. Way too much.

71
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,665
Ashley:<i> Getting ready in 30 minutes isn't a crazy concept,</i>

72
00:03:19,698 --> 00:03:21,334
but a red carpet event?

73
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,636
I have no idea how to do that type of glam in 30 minutes.

74
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:26,239
Okay, concealer. Not coming through.

75
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:28,274
What the-- is this shade?

76
00:03:28,307 --> 00:03:31,510
Oh, no.

77
00:03:31,543 --> 00:03:34,347
Oh, my God. Gray the house.

78
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,349
Oh, please come through with the powder.

79
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:37,984
( sighs )

80
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:39,719
<i> James knows how to clock some bad makeup,</i>

81
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:41,954
so the gray contour is definitely making me feel

82
00:03:41,987 --> 00:03:42,989
a little gray on the inside.

83
00:03:50,996 --> 00:03:54,533
I am a pink bitch. I'm sweating so bad.

84
00:03:54,566 --> 00:03:57,903
I'm literally just rushing and doing whatever I can to get it done.

85
00:03:57,936 --> 00:03:59,239
That's good enough for now.

86
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,876
( groans ) I look like Kermit the Frog right now.

87
00:04:03,909 --> 00:04:06,445
- Ooh, okay. - ( groans )

88
00:04:06,478 --> 00:04:09,649
All right, you guys, we have less that one minute remaining.

89
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:13,919
- Oh, my God. - Just need gloss, just need  gloss, just need gloss.

90
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:15,921
- Where's lip gloss? - You better stay on.

91
00:04:15,954 --> 00:04:17,723
Gabriel:<i> I'm really happy with the precision in my makeup,</i>

92
00:04:17,756 --> 00:04:18,891
so I'm feeling really confident.

93
00:04:18,924 --> 00:04:20,893
<i> I love the way it turned out.</i>

94
00:04:22,027 --> 00:04:24,997
Five, four, three,

95
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:28,734
two, one, makeup down.

96
00:04:28,767 --> 00:04:30,803
We're done. Stop!

97
00:04:30,836 --> 00:04:33,773
Oh, my God. ( chuckles )

98
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:36,676
Ashley:<i> 30 minutes is up and Benny sticks out the most.</i>

99
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:40,646
He looks flawless. His looks so good, I'm getting a little bit nervous.

100
00:04:40,679 --> 00:04:43,049
Maybe this look was not the right call.

101
00:04:44,683 --> 00:04:46,819
Okay, you guys can go ahead and get dressed.

102
00:04:46,852 --> 00:04:49,588
Quickly, we're running to an event 'cause you're running late.

103
00:04:49,621 --> 00:04:51,424
And then you guys can come back here and we'll take a look at your makeup looks

104
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:52,725
up close and personal.

105
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,331
- Hello, you guys. - Hello.

106
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:00,399
Come on over. Come on over.

107
00:05:00,432 --> 00:05:02,968
I'm literally sweating. I'm, like, dying.

108
00:05:03,001 --> 00:05:06,572
<i> I look over and I'm like, Ashley looks flawless,</i>

109
00:05:06,605 --> 00:05:10,543
<i> Benny has perfect skin, and then mine looks like crap.</i>

110
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:13,012
I don't know how this is gonna pan out.

111
00:05:13,045 --> 00:05:15,081
Welcome back. We're gonna start with Kailin,

112
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:17,350
the winner of last week's challenge.

113
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:18,617
- Pressure's on. - Oh, my gosh.

114
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,619
Okay, tell me about this look.

115
00:05:20,652 --> 00:05:22,722
Kailin:<i> I really wanted to focus on making the skin good.</i>

116
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:24,724
<i> And then I just wanted to make sure that lashes were on</i>

117
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:26,625
because if you have no makeup on,

118
00:05:26,658 --> 00:05:29,628
- lashes can do you so much. - James:<i> Yeah.</i>

119
00:05:29,661 --> 00:05:32,465
Kailin:<i> Then I did peach tone shadow for my blush</i>

120
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,967
<i> and in the eyes, and then I just covered the lash glue with blue.</i>

121
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,969
Yeah. I think it looks super good.

122
00:05:37,002 --> 00:05:40,506
I love the pop of blue. It really brings out your eyes so gorgeously.

123
00:05:40,539 --> 00:05:43,075
My one note for you would actually be in the foundation looking a little bit cakey,

124
00:05:43,108 --> 00:05:44,477
especially underneath the eye area.

125
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,878
In regard to the lashes,

126
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:47,580
I would have loved to see a more simple lash

127
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:49,882
or actually trimming off the last spike of them

128
00:05:49,915 --> 00:05:51,650
because they're kind of pulling down your eyes a little bit.

129
00:05:51,683 --> 00:05:53,753
- But overall, you look  beautiful as always. - Thank you.

130
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:56,122
- Indigo, moving on. - Hi.

131
00:05:56,155 --> 00:06:00,426
- Hello, sister. - I'm known for being bright,  crazy, and out there,

132
00:06:00,459 --> 00:06:03,162
<i> so I did translate that into this look by doing a little graphic liner</i>

133
00:06:03,195 --> 00:06:05,564
- and the pop of color. - Yeah.

134
00:06:05,597 --> 00:06:08,701
I think it looks really good. I love that you did a pop art-like type vibes,

135
00:06:08,734 --> 00:06:10,669
which I think is super, super cool.

136
00:06:10,702 --> 00:06:13,105
I love the pop of yellow, as well. I think it really is a nice contrast

137
00:06:13,138 --> 00:06:15,674
to the black outfit. Eyebrows I think could have been a little bit cleaner,

138
00:06:15,707 --> 00:06:17,710
- just in terms of getting  something underneath. -<i> I didn't even do them at all.</i>

139
00:06:17,743 --> 00:06:19,745
Okay. Well, luckily you have thick brows to begin with.

140
00:06:19,778 --> 00:06:22,481
But that can definitely be something that comes up in photos.

141
00:06:22,514 --> 00:06:24,450
- But as for the eyes,  I love the look. - Thank you.

142
00:06:24,483 --> 00:06:26,652
- Moving on to Benny.  Hello, girl. - Hi. Hi.

143
00:06:26,685 --> 00:06:28,921
- You look beautiful. - Thank you so much.

144
00:06:28,954 --> 00:06:32,658
- Okay, tell me about this look. - So I wanted to match  with my outfit

145
00:06:32,691 --> 00:06:35,027
<i> because I love pink. It's, like, my favorite color.</i>

146
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,898
<i> And I wanted to kind of simple-ize it with my glowy base.</i>

147
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:41,634
And if I was to go out and I had no time,

148
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:44,537
I would put this on and go out and slay.

149
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,907
I think this look is very, very cohesive and well put together.

150
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:51,877
Sometimes simple is better. My note for you, your inside of your lash is popping off

151
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:54,580
<i> a little bit, so I would love to see just a little bit more time taping that.</i>

152
00:06:54,613 --> 00:06:58,751
I actually have an eye condition where my eye waters a lot, this eye.

153
00:06:58,784 --> 00:07:01,187
So that eyelash kind of popped out.

154
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,222
If the inner corners are watery, sometimes what I do

155
00:07:03,255 --> 00:07:05,157
is I'll just focus my lash on the outer portion

156
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,593
to really get that lifted look and just really focus

157
00:07:07,626 --> 00:07:10,463
- a lot of mascara on the inside  to avoid any lifting. - Yeah.

158
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:12,865
And then as well, this highlighter that you have on is beautiful.

159
00:07:12,898 --> 00:07:16,635
It's gonna photograph well, but in person it does look a little bit intense.

160
00:07:16,668 --> 00:07:19,638
I would love to see you try to soften up the highlight and contour just a little bit

161
00:07:19,671 --> 00:07:22,741
- for more of a natural look.  Great job. - Yes. Thank you so much.

162
00:07:22,774 --> 00:07:25,177
All right, Ashley, tell me about this look today.

163
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:28,547
Ashley:<i> I wanted to do something that was borderline classic and trendy on the eyes</i>

164
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,749
<i> and in my comfort zone. Same with my lips.</i>

165
00:07:30,782 --> 00:07:32,485
I feel like red lips are classic

166
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:34,653
and they look like you've done more just in general.

167
00:07:34,686 --> 00:07:36,689
Yeah. I think this look looks incredible.

168
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:38,224
It is very impressive how symmetrical

169
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:40,059
you were able to get this in a short period of time.

170
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:42,094
I think that the eye look and just the lashes are really

171
00:07:42,127 --> 00:07:44,763
- doing a great job of  lifting your face upwards. - Thank you.

172
00:07:44,796 --> 00:07:48,200
My one note for you is that your contour is looking a little bit gray toned.

173
00:07:48,233 --> 00:07:51,070
- Oh, my gosh. I know.  Totally understand that. - Okay.

174
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:53,606
Totally watch for that. Everything else looks really, really great.

175
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,140
- Great job. - Thank you, James.

176
00:07:55,173 --> 00:07:56,876
Gabriel, tell us about your look.

177
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:59,512
So today I just wanted to do something a little simple

178
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:02,214
<i> and really focus on the graphic eyeliner.</i>

179
00:08:02,247 --> 00:08:05,251
<i> Popped in some color and some lashes and did the rest of the face.</i>

180
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:07,653
I really like this graphic liner.

181
00:08:07,686 --> 00:08:10,756
My one note for you would be that since you do have a little bit more of hooded eyes,

182
00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:13,659
if somebody takes a photo of you, they're not gonna see it.

183
00:08:13,692 --> 00:08:16,996
Right now, I can really only see your lashes and the bottom half of the circle.

184
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:18,797
The upper half is getting lost.

185
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,566
When it comes to being at events,

186
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:23,569
sometimes making those choices to go simpler is a better choice

187
00:08:23,602 --> 00:08:26,138
because it's going to photograph and look more cohesive overall.

188
00:08:26,171 --> 00:08:27,840
- Right. - That being said,  it was pretty impressive

189
00:08:27,873 --> 00:08:29,975
to get it fully symmetrical, and I would have loved to see

190
00:08:30,008 --> 00:08:31,944
you focus a little bit more on the base and the skin

191
00:08:31,977 --> 00:08:34,647
rather than a beautiful eye look, but it looks great.

192
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,615
- Thank you. - Great job.  All right, you guys,

193
00:08:36,648 --> 00:08:38,551
I know you woke up very early this morning,

194
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:40,953
and I really appreciate you putting these looks together.

195
00:08:40,986 --> 00:08:44,256
Two of you guys really, really impressed me.

196
00:08:44,289 --> 00:08:47,660
Ashley, I love that you used techniques that you're familiar with

197
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,729
in order to create a successful look.

198
00:08:50,762 --> 00:08:53,332
Benny, your look today I think was beautiful,

199
00:08:53,365 --> 00:08:55,634
and this is what we want to see.

200
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:57,303
Both of you two did an amazing job today,

201
00:08:57,336 --> 00:09:00,773
but it's really about who could show up at an event unclockable.

202
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:03,609
The winner of today's Compact Challenge is...

203
00:09:04,843 --> 00:09:07,113
Ashley. Congratulations.

204
00:09:08,914 --> 00:09:10,849
Two challenges in a row, baby.

205
00:09:10,882 --> 00:09:13,152
This means you are going to get, once again,

206
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:14,787
an advantage in today's elimination challenge,

207
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,623
which is going to come in very, very handy.

208
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:21,794
Now that you guys had to get glammed up in a hurry,

209
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:23,362
for today's elimination challenge--

210
00:09:23,395 --> 00:09:25,297
oh, I'm so excited!

211
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:26,865
We're going to be doing a style of makeup

212
00:09:26,898 --> 00:09:28,768
that can't exactly be rushed.

213
00:09:30,268 --> 00:09:32,871
- Drag. - Yeah!

214
00:09:32,904 --> 00:09:34,707
- Oh, my God. - Yes!

215
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,743
I am so excited. I am literally a drag queen.

216
00:09:37,776 --> 00:09:40,879
Okay, drag makeup has had an undeniable impact

217
00:09:40,912 --> 00:09:42,881
on the beauty influencer community.

218
00:09:42,914 --> 00:09:45,784
For today's challenge, I really want to pay homage to that.

219
00:09:45,817 --> 00:09:48,921
I did my first drag transformation about four-ish years ago now,

220
00:09:48,954 --> 00:09:52,224
<i> and it was not great, but I've been practicing a lot ever since.</i>

221
00:09:52,257 --> 00:09:55,861
We can learn so, so much from drag queens as influencers.

222
00:09:55,894 --> 00:09:58,731
They teach us about creativity, performance art,

223
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,766
quick-witted humor, and most importantly,

224
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:02,801
being able to connect with an audience.

225
00:10:02,834 --> 00:10:05,104
So for this elimination challenge, you artists will have three hours

226
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:08,073
to create and execute

227
00:10:08,106 --> 00:10:11,010
your ultimate drag transformation from the neck up.

228
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:13,913
I wanted to bring in an expert for a little bit of advice.

229
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,251
( cheering )

230
00:10:19,284 --> 00:10:24,356
When I see Trixie Mattel walk in, I am so floored.

231
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:27,126
- Oh, my God. - Oh, my God.

232
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:31,363
I cannot believe that a drag legend is going to be judging this challenge.

233
00:10:31,396 --> 00:10:34,366
Please welcome one of the best drag queens in the entire world,

234
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,069
the winner of "RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars" season three,

235
00:10:37,102 --> 00:10:40,406
also one of the funniest people I have ever met, Trixie Mattel.

236
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:44,710
- Hello, hello. - No way.

237
00:10:44,743 --> 00:10:46,145
Trixie, thank you so much for being here today.

238
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:47,880
- I am so excited to have you. - Of course.

239
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:50,082
I thought we're here to drag someone, right?

240
00:10:50,115 --> 00:10:52,217
-<i> ( ding ) </i> - Oh, for sure. Absolutely.

241
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,119
- That is the goal  at the end of the day. - Yeah.

242
00:10:54,152 --> 00:10:56,789
Trixie, what do you want to see from them in this transformation?

243
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,924
Well, being a successful drag queen from YouTube

244
00:10:58,957 --> 00:11:00,693
is something I am an expert in.

245
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:03,328
- Serious. - So, I want to see  bold choices.

246
00:11:03,361 --> 00:11:05,964
I want to see bright colors, clean lines.

247
00:11:05,997 --> 00:11:08,834
I want audiences to see you from space.

248
00:11:10,168 --> 00:11:12,104
- Just go big. - Or go home.

249
00:11:12,137 --> 00:11:15,474
'Cause somebody will be eliminated at the end of this challenge today.

250
00:11:15,507 --> 00:11:18,343
So, Ashley, as today's Compact Challenge winner,

251
00:11:18,376 --> 00:11:21,013
that means you get an advantage in today's challenge.

252
00:11:21,046 --> 00:11:23,482
You will get 15 minutes of a head start,

253
00:11:23,515 --> 00:11:26,418
and you will also get a private consultation with Trixie

254
00:11:26,451 --> 00:11:28,420
to make sure that your look is going in the right direction.

255
00:11:28,453 --> 00:11:31,223
Oh, my gosh. Thank you so much.

256
00:11:31,256 --> 00:11:33,759
Ashley:<i> To have this advantage with Trixie is priceless.</i>

257
00:11:33,792 --> 00:11:36,028
and to be able to talk to her about this

258
00:11:36,061 --> 00:11:38,897
and actually bounce some ideas off her beforehand is absolutely incredible.

259
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,833
Okay, that means while Ashley's starting,

260
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:43,168
everybody else will be chilling on the couch thinking,

261
00:11:43,201 --> 00:11:45,070
hopefully about the look that you're gonna do

262
00:11:45,103 --> 00:11:48,006
with 15 minutes less time than Ashley has.

263
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:50,976
All right, artists, remember to blend, but don't blend in.

264
00:11:51,009 --> 00:11:55,180
Ashley, your time starts right now. Go!

265
00:11:55,213 --> 00:11:58,217
This is gonna be the shortest 15 minutes of your whole life.

266
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:01,487
Having a drag legend giving me this consultation is so special.

267
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,323
A lot of the girls I know who live their lives as women and then they do drag,

268
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:08,494
they really push it that extra up to 11 to make it I'm a woman in drag

269
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:11,263
- and I'm somehow  otherworldly in a way. - Okay.

270
00:12:11,296 --> 00:12:15,534
- Like maybe experiment  with more color. - Otherworldly.

271
00:12:15,567 --> 00:12:19,204
This is so agonizing, the time.

272
00:12:19,237 --> 00:12:22,941
- Wow, 15 minutes feels  like forever. - Okay.

273
00:12:22,974 --> 00:12:25,978
You could get this one or this one and you could put your hair in a bun,

274
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:27,980
and you could attach it as the pony.

275
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:29,448
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

276
00:12:29,481 --> 00:12:31,517
- Yeah! - You like that?

277
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,452
'Cause if you do one bun, you can attach it.

278
00:12:33,485 --> 00:12:34,987
- I didn't even think  about that. - Oh, my God.

279
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,055
'Cause I'm so concerned about my hair.

280
00:12:37,088 --> 00:12:39,057
Try to be a different person, too. Your hair's your giveaway.

281
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,292
- Right. - They'll know who that is.

282
00:12:40,325 --> 00:12:42,227
But if you do one bun and attach that,

283
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,530
and then use flowers or something to do, like-- to camouflage the--

284
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:47,199
To cam-- yeah, cam-- yeah.

285
00:12:47,232 --> 00:12:49,168
What wig do you think you guys are going to go for?

286
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:51,069
- I'm going for the pink one. - Me, too.

287
00:12:51,102 --> 00:12:53,505
- That's going to compliment  the idea I have. - Same.

288
00:12:53,538 --> 00:12:57,142
Realistically, everybody's going for the pink one

289
00:12:57,175 --> 00:12:59,878
- because it's the cutest. - Benny: I have an idea.

290
00:12:59,911 --> 00:13:01,547
'Cause there is this fashion doll that I own,

291
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:04,349
and that image in my mind is just perfect.

292
00:13:04,382 --> 00:13:09,221
I'm sorry, Benny, but I'm getting that pink wig.

293
00:13:09,254 --> 00:13:11,056
- Do you have any other  questions? I won't bother you. - No. I want to get started.

294
00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:13,559
I'm, like, I want to keep going, but I will, like--

295
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:16,195
- You're gonna be great. - Ashley:<i> I am so happy that I won the Compact Challenge</i>

296
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:18,597
because there's so many different styles of drag.

297
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,465
I need color.

298
00:13:20,498 --> 00:13:22,568
And after talking to Trixie, I have a really clear vision

299
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:24,436
of what I'm gonna do.

300
00:13:24,469 --> 00:13:27,039
<i> I'm thinking blue skin, extraterrestrial.</i>

301
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:30,108
I'm gonna go totally different species.

302
00:13:30,141 --> 00:13:33,112
Oh, it's not working. A brush.

303
00:13:36,648 --> 00:13:39,151
All right, artists,

304
00:13:39,184 --> 00:13:43,589
five, four, three, two, one, go!

305
00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:46,959
Ah!

306
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,995
Yes! ( laughing )

307
00:13:52,664 --> 00:13:55,067
Oh, you're so beautiful!

308
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,403
Wig snatched, literally. Sorry, Benny.

309
00:13:58,436 --> 00:14:01,073
( bleep ) him.

310
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:03,475
( squeals )

311
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,183
Indigo:<i> In this drag transformation, I really wanted to do</i>

312
00:14:11,216 --> 00:14:15,287
a anime-inspired super pink, super bright look,

313
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:19,625
<i> so I'm going for a very kawaii anime sad girl aesthetic</i>

314
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:21,493
because I really just want this

315
00:14:21,526 --> 00:14:24,129
to be an emphasized version of myself.

316
00:14:24,162 --> 00:14:27,065
Like, I really want some anime blush going on here.

317
00:14:27,098 --> 00:14:28,634
<i> I'm very familiar with drag.</i>

318
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:32,638
However, I've never done drag on myself,

319
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:34,139
so this is gonna be interesting.

320
00:14:34,172 --> 00:14:36,242
So, so, so cute.

321
00:14:40,478 --> 00:14:43,482
Girl, I'm really pissed off. I'm sorry, but I really am.

322
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:46,418
- Why? What's up? - I was going for that wig.

323
00:14:46,451 --> 00:14:47,653
Because Indigo took the wig,

324
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:50,122
I have to change my look and modify it.

325
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:52,257
This is horrible!

326
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:54,259
- Whatever. - Well.

327
00:14:54,292 --> 00:14:56,528
Still gonna beat him. Medium deep.

328
00:14:56,561 --> 00:14:58,364
The sauce. I can't.

329
00:15:02,267 --> 00:15:04,937
My idea is to take neon face paint,

330
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,139
<i> give a little streak in the hair,</i>

331
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:09,408
some pigtails, and make it look really cute.

332
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:11,944
Quickly dry it out.

333
00:15:21,419 --> 00:15:25,190
( clicking )

334
00:15:26,491 --> 00:15:29,428
- My-- it was off. - ( hair dryer starts )

335
00:15:39,637 --> 00:15:41,239
This shit's about to be risky,

336
00:15:41,272 --> 00:15:43,241
and it's all or nothing. Let's go.

337
00:15:43,274 --> 00:15:46,545
Kailin:<i> I have never done drag, but I want people to know</i>

338
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:48,447
that I'm not just some smoky eye artist.

339
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,749
I can also do tough work.

340
00:15:50,782 --> 00:15:54,152
- Okay. Okay. - Are you gonna do  a crazy color or no?

341
00:15:54,185 --> 00:15:55,620
- Yeah. - You are?

342
00:15:55,653 --> 00:15:58,290
So I'm taking an extreme risk

343
00:15:58,323 --> 00:16:02,661
by doing a full pink face inspired by Trixie Mattel.

344
00:16:02,694 --> 00:16:07,232
So if I don't do a good job, it could go south real quick.

345
00:16:07,265 --> 00:16:11,270
A drag queen will kill me if my eyebrows were not laid down.

346
00:16:14,272 --> 00:16:16,441
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

347
00:16:16,474 --> 00:16:20,479
For my drag transformation, I want to present myself as a lioness.

348
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:22,481
<i> I feel like the main thing that's going to make it or break it</i>

349
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:24,383
is really portraying that drag eye.

350
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,351
( groans )

351
00:16:26,384 --> 00:16:27,686
Not only doing them themselves,

352
00:16:27,719 --> 00:16:29,554
<i> but making sure that that brow is flat.</i>

353
00:16:29,587 --> 00:16:31,456
( groans )

354
00:16:31,489 --> 00:16:34,359
I always like trippy things, so I'm gonna do four feline eyes

355
00:16:34,392 --> 00:16:36,661
on my cheeks and a pink skin tone.

356
00:16:36,694 --> 00:16:39,231
- That's just gonna have to do. -<i> I'm gonna draw my lips</i>

357
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:42,568
into the shape of a cat mouth to make this a "fe-lion."

358
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:50,042
I don't know about this paint anymore.

359
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:53,211
As soon as I start applying the watercolor,

360
00:16:53,244 --> 00:16:56,615
I realize that was a huge mistake.

361
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:59,651
Oh, my God. This isn't working.

362
00:16:59,684 --> 00:17:02,421
<i> It's patchy the house. It's not layering.</i>

363
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:04,456
Every time I try to build it up, it's moving.

364
00:17:04,489 --> 00:17:06,792
My heart starts beating fast.

365
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:10,295
No. Oh, my God.

366
00:17:10,328 --> 00:17:12,164
I have to start over. Shit.

367
00:17:13,731 --> 00:17:18,503
That ( bleep ) paint is not the move.

368
00:17:18,536 --> 00:17:20,338
<i> I thought I had an advantage with the time,</i>

369
00:17:20,371 --> 00:17:21,807
<i> but now that I've been set back,</i>

370
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,608
<i> that advantage is no longer</i>

371
00:17:23,641 --> 00:17:26,711
and now I'm back at square one.

372
00:17:26,744 --> 00:17:29,148
And if this don't work, we're just gonna have to move on.

373
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:42,527
The more powder, the better.

374
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:46,465
All right, you guys, it looks like you have about one hour and 20 minutes remaining.

375
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:49,835
I love all of you so much, but unfortunately one person will be going home

376
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:52,404
at the end of today's challenge, so bring it.

377
00:17:52,437 --> 00:17:54,806
- Bye. - If it make you feel better,  I'm going home today, too.

378
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:56,442
( James laughs )

379
00:17:59,644 --> 00:18:01,379
Am I the only one doing, like, a natural skin tone?

380
00:18:01,412 --> 00:18:02,881
- Natural skin tone? - Snatchural.

381
00:18:02,914 --> 00:18:04,883
- I am. - Snatchural.

382
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:07,752
At this point, I'm kind of questioning my makeup look

383
00:18:07,785 --> 00:18:09,821
just because everybody else is so out there.

384
00:18:09,854 --> 00:18:12,724
So I'm really going to have to bring it in terms of detail.

385
00:18:12,757 --> 00:18:15,227
Indigo is starting. It's a very beautiful look.

386
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,563
It seems like he's a little bit snail speed.

387
00:18:18,596 --> 00:18:20,198
- James: He's going very slowly. - Trixie: So if he can  pick up the pace,

388
00:18:20,231 --> 00:18:22,400
I think it's gonna be a really pretty look.

389
00:18:22,433 --> 00:18:26,438
Because, of everybody, I think his face is definitely successfully reshaped.

390
00:18:26,471 --> 00:18:27,873
Yeah, his contour's in the right place.

391
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:29,541
His jawline and contour's in the right place.

392
00:18:29,574 --> 00:18:31,376
It has, like-- shading and everything and looks good.

393
00:18:31,409 --> 00:18:34,246
Trixie: It's crazy that he's choosing to do a sad look

394
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:37,516
when every day I put on makeup to cover a sad look.

395
00:18:39,884 --> 00:18:42,354
Ooh. I'm about to fight my hair.

396
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,391
Oh, what's our drag names, you guys?

397
00:18:46,424 --> 00:18:49,227
- Vanilla Clown. - Mine is gonna be Smash Me.

398
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:52,597
- Issa Woman. - ( chuckles )  That's cute.

399
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:54,432
- Oh, I know my drag name. - What's your drag name?

400
00:18:54,465 --> 00:18:56,434
- Do Too Much. - Unity.

401
00:18:56,467 --> 00:18:58,436
- Ooh! - Yeah, I like that.

402
00:18:58,469 --> 00:19:00,605
You're so cute. Since you've been here, you've been like,

403
00:19:00,638 --> 00:19:04,543
- "I just love the animals." - I know! I do!

404
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:06,545
I am the animals. I'm the trees, girl.

405
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:08,447
Oh, my God, stop. You're gonna cry.

406
00:19:10,348 --> 00:19:12,717
James: Benny put his eyebrows pretty high up.

407
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,387
Like, way above his natural brow,

408
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:18,823
which is one of the mistakes that people make a lot when they first do drag.

409
00:19:18,856 --> 00:19:21,459
So I'm really hoping that his liner application

410
00:19:21,492 --> 00:19:25,463
is large to fix that space gap.

411
00:19:25,496 --> 00:19:27,666
- Yeah, I agree. - That looks great, Benny.

412
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:28,700
Thank you.

413
00:19:34,372 --> 00:19:36,975
Kailin:<i> I have never fully painted my face like I am today,</i>

414
00:19:37,008 --> 00:19:40,445
and I really want to make sure that it looks flawless.

415
00:19:40,478 --> 00:19:42,647
I'm watching her keep layering product on and I can tell

416
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,949
it's because she's not happy with the base.

417
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:45,417
But if the base isn't working,

418
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,252
more product isn't really gonna help.

419
00:19:47,285 --> 00:19:48,820
Right. It's like if you build a house on a bad foundation.

420
00:19:52,957 --> 00:19:56,795
Kailin:<i> Do I stay here and do I keep trying to make this product work?</i>

421
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:59,464
Or do I take off this face

422
00:19:59,497 --> 00:20:02,834
and do I start parts of this over again?

423
00:20:02,867 --> 00:20:04,536
Don't even look at the clock.

424
00:20:09,774 --> 00:20:11,309
Kailin:<i> I made the decision to take it off,</i>

425
00:20:11,342 --> 00:20:12,945
and I'm hoping that's the right decision.

426
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:23,421
We have to do something about these eyes.

427
00:20:23,454 --> 00:20:24,889
I feel so stressed.

428
00:20:24,922 --> 00:20:27,025
Oh.

429
00:20:27,058 --> 00:20:28,960
These eyes need to stop watering right now,

430
00:20:28,993 --> 00:20:31,363
because right now I look like a hot mess.

431
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,531
I don't know if I'm gonna be able to get this look together

432
00:20:33,564 --> 00:20:35,567
because my eyes are watering so badly.

433
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,404
My eyes are like my worst enemy right now.

434
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,442
So, I'm covering my watering eyes with neon tears.

435
00:20:44,475 --> 00:20:47,980
Okay, now I need lashes.

436
00:20:55,453 --> 00:20:57,856
I think what really sets me apart from everyone else's drag look

437
00:20:57,889 --> 00:21:00,358
<i> is that not only is my skin a different color,</i>

438
00:21:00,391 --> 00:21:02,794
<i> but I'm more feline than human.</i>

439
00:21:02,827 --> 00:21:04,429
I really think that I have this one in the bag.

440
00:21:04,462 --> 00:21:05,697
Meow.

441
00:21:11,402 --> 00:21:15,407
Right now, I am so nervous.

442
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,710
I really, really want to do a good job tonight.

443
00:21:18,743 --> 00:21:20,412
Oh, my God. I actually look like a little anime character right now.

444
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:23,748
- Ooh! You do look cute. - Kawaii.

445
00:21:23,781 --> 00:21:26,084
- How much time  do we have left? - 33 minutes.

446
00:21:26,117 --> 00:21:29,921
30? Oh, hell, no. Where did the time go? Like, seriously?

447
00:21:36,127 --> 00:21:38,430
I'm, like, running out of time. I'm a little bit freaking out.

448
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:41,833
<i> But I want to add some detail to my four eyes on my cheeks,</i>

449
00:21:41,866 --> 00:21:43,869
so that they look like eyes and not just white spots on my face.

450
00:21:49,907 --> 00:21:52,610
This is your ten-minute time call.

451
00:21:52,643 --> 00:21:54,045
And not a drag queen ten minutes,

452
00:21:54,078 --> 00:21:55,447
which is 40 minutes.

453
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,982
This is the real thing. Ten minutes.

454
00:21:59,016 --> 00:22:00,885
Oh, that's dope.

455
00:22:00,918 --> 00:22:04,789
Oh, these brows are not even friends.

456
00:22:04,822 --> 00:22:09,127
Indigo:<i> Honestly, I'm not too experienced in doing brows,</i>

457
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,629
much less a drag brow.

458
00:22:11,662 --> 00:22:14,499
<i> They can be my downfall very quick.</i>

459
00:22:16,434 --> 00:22:19,637
The face that this shows is like how I feel right now

460
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:21,539
with these brows.

461
00:22:21,572 --> 00:22:23,808
<i> I'm scared of the position of the brows</i>

462
00:22:23,841 --> 00:22:26,111
because if I do this wrong, I can look frightened

463
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:29,681
or confused instead of sad.

464
00:22:29,714 --> 00:22:31,149
At this point, I don't got no time.

465
00:22:31,182 --> 00:22:32,817
I just want to get this over with

466
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:35,721
<i> because I want something to present.</i>

467
00:22:38,189 --> 00:22:41,760
- Hello. - Oh, my gosh. Hi, Trixie!

468
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:44,829
Hello. This is your five-minute warning.

469
00:22:44,862 --> 00:22:47,499
- Oh, my God. - And I did all of this  this morning

470
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,701
in only four minutes, so I think you guys should be okay.

471
00:22:51,702 --> 00:22:53,171
And remember, if you don't have perfume on,

472
00:22:53,204 --> 00:22:55,040
you are not a woman.

473
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:02,714
One minute.

474
00:23:02,747 --> 00:23:04,149
And the we're gonna need you to put down

475
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:06,752
your number two pencils and turn in your Scantron.

476
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:15,059
Gabriel:<i> Ten seconds on the clock, I still don't have my wig on.</i>

477
00:23:15,092 --> 00:23:17,595
At six seconds, I hurriedly put some wig tape on,

478
00:23:17,628 --> 00:23:18,964
and I shoved that on my head.

479
00:23:20,498 --> 00:23:22,867
Trixie: Five, four, put some glitter on,

480
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:26,004
three, two, one. Stop!

481
00:23:27,738 --> 00:23:30,742
Whether you are in drag or not, you are now in drag.

482
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:35,880
- Ooh. - All right, I'm gonna go  get James and Norvina,

483
00:23:35,913 --> 00:23:38,049
and I'll see you at judging. Bye!

484
00:23:38,082 --> 00:23:39,151
- Bye! - Bye.

485
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,831
- Oh, wow. - I think I got goosebumps.

486
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:54,566
We're doing a drag show tonight.

487
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:57,735
( chuckles ) Oh, my gosh.

488
00:23:57,768 --> 00:23:59,571
I want to introduce you guys to our guest judges.

489
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:02,574
- We have the legendary  makeup icon Norvina. - Hi, guys.

490
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,576
President and creative director of Anastasia of Beverly Hills.

491
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,177
And also the skinniest legend in the entire world,

492
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:09,113
- Trixie Mattel. - Yes!

493
00:24:09,146 --> 00:24:10,915
You all look beautiful from afar,

494
00:24:10,948 --> 00:24:14,085
but I know this drag makeup challenge was absolutely insane.

495
00:24:14,118 --> 00:24:16,154
You had three hours to create these looks

496
00:24:16,187 --> 00:24:18,122
and show us what drag means to you.

497
00:24:18,155 --> 00:24:21,793
Looking in front of me, I see five insane makeup looks

498
00:24:21,826 --> 00:24:23,094
that I am so excited to dig into.

499
00:24:23,127 --> 00:24:24,762
Gabriel, we're gonna see your look first.

500
00:24:24,795 --> 00:24:28,533
The rest of you guys can take a seat.

501
00:24:28,566 --> 00:24:30,935
Hello, hello, hello. Talk to us about this makeup look.

502
00:24:30,968 --> 00:24:33,605
Well, I've kinda had a drag persona.

503
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:38,510
Her name is Unity. She's like an intergalactic, not from this type of world,

504
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:40,612
as in that's what I feel like Unity is.

505
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:42,947
Awesome. How was this makeup process for you today?

506
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:45,250
Very intense. I almost didn't finish.

507
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:47,719
But in the end, it came through

508
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:49,921
and I've very satisfied how it came out.

509
00:24:49,954 --> 00:24:52,624
That is so drag, though. Like, the music is starting.

510
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:56,828
You're like, "I'll be right there." It never gets easier.

511
00:24:56,861 --> 00:24:58,630
I think this look turned out really cool.

512
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:00,131
<i> I like the overall concept, and I like your choice</i>

513
00:25:00,164 --> 00:25:01,933
<i> of using a pink foundation.</i>

514
00:25:01,966 --> 00:25:06,070
This is gonna stain you tomorrow, so be ready for that.

515
00:25:06,103 --> 00:25:08,540
I think the cat upper lip is actually really working.

516
00:25:08,573 --> 00:25:10,308
- James: Yeah.  I think it looks sick. - Trixie: Really seems like

517
00:25:10,341 --> 00:25:12,810
- the real anatomy of his face. - Yeah, the shading in that

518
00:25:12,843 --> 00:25:14,812
looks really, really good.

519
00:25:14,845 --> 00:25:17,048
Yeah. I think especially since you have these chunky,

520
00:25:17,081 --> 00:25:19,951
<i> peasy lashes on your eyes, if you had ten minutes</i>

521
00:25:19,984 --> 00:25:22,654
to add small lashes around the fake eyes,

522
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:24,622
they would have looked so much realer.

523
00:25:24,655 --> 00:25:25,790
That was actually an intention of mine.

524
00:25:25,823 --> 00:25:26,791
I just was running out of time.

525
00:25:26,824 --> 00:25:28,726
The eyes impressed me the most,

526
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:31,162
and I would have loved to see that eye throughout

527
00:25:31,195 --> 00:25:34,566
and just creating a massive large eye to tie in with the little eyes.

528
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:36,834
- I think you would have  been really trippy. - Yeah. Thank you.

529
00:25:36,867 --> 00:25:39,003
- So maybe next time. - Overall, I think time  management is something

530
00:25:39,036 --> 00:25:42,640
that is of the essence. This look is great, but it could have been even greater.

531
00:25:42,673 --> 00:25:46,678
- Thank you. - All right. I'm obsessed  with this look, Kailin.

532
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,212
- I think it turned out so good. - Thank you.

533
00:25:48,245 --> 00:25:50,181
Yeah. And I'm not gonna lie, of everybody here,

534
00:25:50,214 --> 00:25:51,716
<i> I thought you were full struggle bus.</i>

535
00:25:51,749 --> 00:25:53,818
I was a little.

536
00:25:53,851 --> 00:25:56,154
It didn't start off good, period, and you know this.

537
00:25:56,187 --> 00:25:59,324
Yeah. I made a decision, like, more than halfway through

538
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:02,093
that I needed to, like, redo my face.

539
00:26:02,126 --> 00:26:05,797
So I took alcohol and just wiped it. I wanted to nail it.

540
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,198
This is my first drag look ever.

541
00:26:07,231 --> 00:26:08,967
Trixie, it's actually inspired by you.

542
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,370
You did a campaign where you had the pink face, and I--

543
00:26:12,403 --> 00:26:14,339
- I did that myself,  so I feel you. Yes. - You did?

544
00:26:14,372 --> 00:26:17,308
I feel amazing! Like, I was able to express myself.

545
00:26:17,341 --> 00:26:19,711
I, like, went so far out of the box

546
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:22,714
- and it was so much fun. - Obviously, you look  absolutely stunning.

547
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,983
I'm staring at the brows and that separation and how they're a little bit--

548
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:28,820
- Oh, right here? - A little bit shorter than  I would have liked them.

549
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:30,388
You're right. We do lose the brow a little bit.

550
00:26:30,421 --> 00:26:32,357
- Yeah. - I think the flowers  are beautiful.

551
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:34,926
I would have loved for you to paint some flowers on your face

552
00:26:34,959 --> 00:26:36,894
- to just kind of tie it  together, you know? - Oh, yeah.

553
00:26:36,927 --> 00:26:39,030
A little mix, but it's beautiful regardless.

554
00:26:39,063 --> 00:26:42,333
- Okay. - You turned this out,  you ( bleep ) whore.

555
00:26:42,366 --> 00:26:44,869
- Thank you! - James: Ashley, tell us about

556
00:26:44,902 --> 00:26:46,371
this look that you created today.

557
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:48,239
I wanted to take it up a notch and just turn myself

558
00:26:48,272 --> 00:26:50,308
<i> into a completely different species.</i>

559
00:26:50,341 --> 00:26:52,010
- Norvina:<i> Cool. </i> -<i> So, extraterrestrial, out of this world.</i>

560
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:54,779
"Otherworldly" was a term that Trixie used, so...

561
00:26:54,812 --> 00:26:56,781
I could tell you had your wheels turning.

562
00:26:56,814 --> 00:26:58,916
So I don't think I definitely had to give you much info

563
00:26:58,949 --> 00:27:00,718
other than the wig turned out great.

564
00:27:00,751 --> 00:27:03,087
I had no idea what I was gonna do with my hair,

565
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,989
so that was like tea.

566
00:27:05,022 --> 00:27:07,058
Ashley, I think that this look was extremely successful.

567
00:27:07,091 --> 00:27:10,028
- Thanks. - Everything about this  is super, super cool.

568
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:12,930
The concept of just being extraterrestrial is very, very apparent.

569
00:27:12,963 --> 00:27:14,932
<i> You look like you came out of the movie "Avatar."</i>

570
00:27:14,965 --> 00:27:16,934
I think the blending of the skin tone is very impressive as well.

571
00:27:16,967 --> 00:27:18,803
I'm assuming you used creams.

572
00:27:18,836 --> 00:27:21,773
I actually grabbed a watercolor first.

573
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,941
And as soon as I realized the consistency

574
00:27:23,974 --> 00:27:27,011
was becoming patchy, I wiped it off completely,

575
00:27:27,044 --> 00:27:29,280
and I grabbed cream, and it was way more successful.

576
00:27:29,313 --> 00:27:31,149
And I actually set it with a blue shade in your palette.

577
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:34,052
- Norvina: Beautiful. - To make it just, like, matte.

578
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:36,287
So your 15-minute advantage turned into a zero advantage.

579
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,791
It literally-- yeah, it was down to the minute.

580
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:42,460
I'm no stranger to a strong nose contour.

581
00:27:42,493 --> 00:27:45,329
I am aware that my nose looks like a white worm in chocolate pudding

582
00:27:45,362 --> 00:27:47,131
and I'm fine with it, but I would say for you,

583
00:27:47,164 --> 00:27:49,233
if I could have, like, turned back time,

584
00:27:49,266 --> 00:27:51,803
I would have, like, probably not gone full black.

585
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:54,105
<i> Because right in the light, you really do see, like--</i>

586
00:27:54,138 --> 00:27:56,441
- do you guys see  the little black hyphen? - Yeah. Yeah.

587
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:59,243
- Right in the middle.  If you went just blue... - Right.

588
00:27:59,276 --> 00:28:03,047
What I really like about your look is that beautiful pink lip.

589
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,817
I would have loved, loved for your lid

590
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,119
to incorporate pink crystals.

591
00:28:08,152 --> 00:28:12,256
- Oh! That would have been good! - And for a pink crystal  under-eye liner here.

592
00:28:12,289 --> 00:28:14,158
Because what's happening is the lashes are huge,

593
00:28:14,191 --> 00:28:17,895
your eyes are dark, and I'm losing your eye.

594
00:28:17,928 --> 00:28:20,264
Wow. I didn't even think about that. Thank you.

595
00:28:20,297 --> 00:28:22,500
All right, Indigo, tell us about this look.

596
00:28:22,533 --> 00:28:24,335
So the second I saw this wig,

597
00:28:24,368 --> 00:28:25,837
<i> I knew that I had to do something</i>

598
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,338
<i> that was very anime-inspired,</i>

599
00:28:27,371 --> 00:28:30,007
<i> very kawaii and pouty and sad</i>

600
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,009
<i> just, like, reflect on Indigo himself,</i>

601
00:28:32,042 --> 00:28:34,278
which is usually very dry and sarcastic.

602
00:28:34,311 --> 00:28:38,249
So if I were a female, I'd want to take that to an emotional side for me.

603
00:28:38,282 --> 00:28:41,185
- Yeah. - So that's what inspired it.

604
00:28:41,218 --> 00:28:42,920
Well, I really like this look. It feels like you have

605
00:28:42,953 --> 00:28:45,022
an Instagram filter on your face,

606
00:28:45,055 --> 00:28:46,390
<i> which is super cute.</i>

607
00:28:46,423 --> 00:28:48,259
I love the drawn-on band-aid and the tears.

608
00:28:48,292 --> 00:28:50,461
- It's a really cute style. - The brows, they should have

609
00:28:50,494 --> 00:28:52,363
been a little bit more well-thought out.

610
00:28:52,396 --> 00:28:56,300
So, overall, if the brow was a little bit more cohesive,

611
00:28:56,333 --> 00:28:58,369
this could have looked really, really chic.

612
00:28:58,402 --> 00:29:00,204
- Yeah. - And I think you  should have leaned

613
00:29:00,237 --> 00:29:03,107
into the pop art movement a little bit more.

614
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:06,043
The band-aid is the best part of this makeup because it seems like

615
00:29:06,076 --> 00:29:07,779
that's the only part of the makeup you were sure of.

616
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,417
( sighs )

617
00:29:17,087 --> 00:29:18,456
I'm sorry. I need to breathe before I cry.

618
00:29:18,489 --> 00:29:21,058
I think I would've changed my eyebrows.

619
00:29:21,091 --> 00:29:23,060
- Yeah. - I'm so sorry. I really don't  want to cry right now.

620
00:29:23,093 --> 00:29:26,230
- It's okay. - I really had higher  expectations of myself,

621
00:29:26,263 --> 00:29:28,399
so I'm not angry at the critiques

622
00:29:28,432 --> 00:29:30,535
because I agree with them 100%,

623
00:29:30,568 --> 00:29:32,103
and that's why I'm upset.

624
00:29:32,136 --> 00:29:34,338
I-- I feel that.

625
00:29:34,371 --> 00:29:36,574
Norvina: I think it's pretty obvious you're very artistic.

626
00:29:36,607 --> 00:29:40,044
You need to trust yourself. I think you felt like you had to be cutesy,

627
00:29:40,077 --> 00:29:44,115
and you, inside, really want to be very artistic and avant-garde.

628
00:29:44,148 --> 00:29:48,085
- And I think you should do it. - Thank you. I will--  I will do that in the future.

629
00:29:48,118 --> 00:29:51,489
- Yeah, absolutely. - Benny, come on forward.

630
00:29:54,458 --> 00:29:56,961
- Hey! Yes. - Give us a twirl!

631
00:29:56,994 --> 00:29:58,162
All right, tell us about this look.

632
00:29:58,195 --> 00:30:00,398
One of my dolls that's in my collection

633
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:02,099
<i> is all full of neon colors,</i>

634
00:30:02,132 --> 00:30:04,135
<i> and I wanted to bring that to life.</i>

635
00:30:04,168 --> 00:30:07,471
But then once I started doing the eyeshadow and everything,

636
00:30:07,504 --> 00:30:09,540
my eyes started watering really, really bad.

637
00:30:09,573 --> 00:30:12,109
- James:<i> Yeah. </i> -<i> So I had to compromise,</i>

638
00:30:12,142 --> 00:30:15,079
<i> because as an influencer and a makeup artist, you have to make it work.</i>

639
00:30:15,112 --> 00:30:20,918
You can't just give up. So I decided to take my emotions and put it into my artwork.

640
00:30:20,951 --> 00:30:22,453
So I took the neon paint

641
00:30:22,486 --> 00:30:24,455
<i> and I made it as a splattered tear</i>

642
00:30:24,488 --> 00:30:26,858
to kind of show all the emotions I had inside.

643
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:29,126
And I also did the flowers

644
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:31,596
<i> to represent me blooming as a person.</i>

645
00:30:31,629 --> 00:30:33,030
Thank you for this look.

646
00:30:33,063 --> 00:30:35,132
I think this is super, super cool.

647
00:30:35,165 --> 00:30:36,968
The colors going on here are so bright and vibrant,

648
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:39,537
and I love how everything really pairs well together.

649
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:43,307
Also, great idea to add the cream color into the hair with the wig.

650
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,343
I thought that was a super, super unique thing.

651
00:30:45,376 --> 00:30:49,513
I wanted to tie it in because I feel like it makes it more cohesive.

652
00:30:49,546 --> 00:30:52,884
Yeah. One note that I would love to give you, there's a lot going on here.

653
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:56,654
I would have loved to see either the flowers or the tears

654
00:30:56,687 --> 00:30:58,923
<i> because I think they're kind of competing for the space</i>

655
00:30:58,956 --> 00:31:00,458
on the bottom of your face right now

656
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:02,493
and it makes that feel a little bit less cohesive.

657
00:31:02,526 --> 00:31:06,197
I think makeup-wise, it could have smarter to do without one.

658
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:09,200
I think that conceptually this is my favorite look.

659
00:31:09,233 --> 00:31:14,939
<i> It's so beautiful. I love a trippy neon kind of acid Barbie look.</i>

660
00:31:14,972 --> 00:31:20,344
That is so beautiful. Symmetry would have made this look gag-worthy.

661
00:31:20,377 --> 00:31:22,246
- Yeah. - Trixie: I'm not gonna lie.

662
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:23,948
These are the best, I think, brows of the night.

663
00:31:23,981 --> 00:31:26,117
<i> You are so petite.</i>

664
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,652
I think this is almost too many lashes on the top.

665
00:31:27,685 --> 00:31:29,353
Don't-- listen, I'm Trixie Mattel,

666
00:31:29,386 --> 00:31:30,521
and I'm saying it to the camera.

667
00:31:30,554 --> 00:31:32,123
Maybe too many lashes on top.

668
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:34,025
'Cause I almost-- I can't see your eye makeup.

669
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:36,093
- I really can't. - Yeah, I was thinking  that, too.

670
00:31:36,126 --> 00:31:38,029
Because I do have a really pretty cut crease with orange glitter.

671
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:40,231
And I only literally just saw it just now.

672
00:31:40,264 --> 00:31:43,534
They're beautiful, but for drag, oh, my gosh.

673
00:31:43,567 --> 00:31:46,971
You need that 55th row at the Hamburger Mary's to see this, you know?

674
00:31:47,004 --> 00:31:48,940
Yes. Definitely understand.

675
00:31:52,509 --> 00:31:55,279
Okay, we have a lot to discuss right now, I feel like.

676
00:31:55,312 --> 00:31:57,381
- Yeah. - I was thoroughly impressed.

677
00:31:57,414 --> 00:31:59,250
- Thoroughly impressed. - They're good.

678
00:31:59,283 --> 00:32:01,686
It's tough with drag because the looks are all so different.

679
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:05,289
It is apples and oranges. Those looks aren't even the same, you know?

680
00:32:05,322 --> 00:32:07,091
- Kailin. - Yeah?

681
00:32:07,124 --> 00:32:08,592
Trixie:<i> Makeup turned out to be, in my opinion,</i>

682
00:32:08,625 --> 00:32:10,061
-<i> one of the best looks. </i> -<i> Yeah.</i>

683
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:12,296
One of the things that I really did not like

684
00:32:12,329 --> 00:32:14,465
<i> is how shiny her base was.</i>

685
00:32:14,498 --> 00:32:17,702
<i> Also, her base and her highlight around the jawline</i>

686
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:19,537
was a good three shades lighter.

687
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:21,973
Trixie:<i> You could tell she set this part</i>

688
00:32:22,006 --> 00:32:24,575
with a pink eyeshadow and didn't set this.

689
00:32:24,608 --> 00:32:26,711
- Correct. No. - They don't look like  the same color.

690
00:32:26,744 --> 00:32:29,013
But I think it did end up being a really successful look.

691
00:32:29,046 --> 00:32:33,084
Let's talk about the other pink look, which was Gabriel.

692
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:36,253
- It turned out good. - I'm gonna stop you  right there.

693
00:32:36,286 --> 00:32:38,189
- Okay. - I do not think this look  turned out good.

694
00:32:38,222 --> 00:32:40,057
- Really? - No, girl.

695
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:41,659
She looks like a windburned Mrs. Claus.

696
00:32:41,692 --> 00:32:44,195
Oh!

697
00:32:44,228 --> 00:32:47,064
Trixie:<i> These eyeballs could not have been more of an afterthought.</i>

698
00:32:47,097 --> 00:32:50,101
On the flip side, I think that the base is really nice.

699
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:53,637
Do you feel his highlighting and contouring changed the shape of his face at all?

700
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:55,106
- James:<i> No. </i> -<i> And to be honest,</i>

701
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,474
I might not even have known he was a cat.

702
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:58,509
But I completely disagree on the cat part.

703
00:32:58,542 --> 00:33:00,678
<i> I think the mouth looks really, really good.</i>

704
00:33:00,711 --> 00:33:03,214
No, I think the lip is the most successful part of the makeup.

705
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:05,316
- I agree. - I told him that to his face.

706
00:33:05,349 --> 00:33:08,486
- Norvina: Okay, who's next? - I would love to  talk about Indigo

707
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:11,622
<i>because he is insanely talented when it comes to artistry,</i>

708
00:33:11,655 --> 00:33:14,558
<i> and this was a really large letdown.</i>

709
00:33:14,591 --> 00:33:17,028
You guys, I had a hard time looking at him because I could see

710
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:19,463
- he agreed with  every critique we had. - He was mortified.

711
00:33:19,496 --> 00:33:22,133
- At least  he knows he did wrong. - You're right.

712
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:26,070
I don't know. Something psyched him out, because he's got the skill set.

713
00:33:26,103 --> 00:33:27,471
I do love the band-aid and the kawaii stuff.

714
00:33:27,504 --> 00:33:29,206
I think it is really, really cute,

715
00:33:29,239 --> 00:33:31,776
<i> and his facial contouring was really good.</i>

716
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:33,544
He could bounce back and grow from it.

717
00:33:33,577 --> 00:33:35,446
- Yeah. - He had a great attitude  about it.

718
00:33:35,479 --> 00:33:38,282
- Yeah. - Yeah, he did. Let's talk  about Ashley next.

719
00:33:38,315 --> 00:33:40,785
-<i> This look was so cool. </i> - Norvina:<i> Beautiful.</i>

720
00:33:40,818 --> 00:33:43,287
The application, her skill set is there.

721
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,456
She sat down and went with her first idea.

722
00:33:45,489 --> 00:33:47,658
- And went, which was great. - Went hard.

723
00:33:47,691 --> 00:33:50,161
I like that about her. I think she's very confident as a makeup artist.

724
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,163
We were in walkthrough, and I said, "What have you done with drag?"

725
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:53,564
She's like, "I've never really done it."

726
00:33:53,597 --> 00:33:55,766
She's like, "I've hosted a few drag balls."

727
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:58,202
I'm like, okay. That's more than dabbling.

728
00:33:58,235 --> 00:34:01,505
- That's-- Yeah, delusion! - I don't know about this one.

729
00:34:01,538 --> 00:34:03,174
Were you gagged, Norvina, when she came out?

730
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,376
I was, but I've seen it before. It's "Avatar."

731
00:34:05,409 --> 00:34:08,345
<i> I think it was too monochromatic. I really wanted that pop.</i>

732
00:34:08,378 --> 00:34:10,414
<i> I just wish she would have stood out more.</i>

733
00:34:10,447 --> 00:34:13,818
I think she wants to play safe even though she's otherworldly.

734
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:17,254
- All right, let's move on to  our last and final-- Benny. - Great.

735
00:34:17,287 --> 00:34:20,157
 Norvina:<i> It's so cool. It's like acid Bratz.</i>

736
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:23,727
I'm obsessed. I wish that the symmetry was better.

737
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,597
<i> I wish that the application was a little bit cleaner.</i>

738
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:28,632
- This was a little messy. - It was a little messy.

739
00:34:28,665 --> 00:34:30,701
- Yeah. - I love the concept,

740
00:34:30,734 --> 00:34:32,403
- but it's messy. - Right.

741
00:34:32,436 --> 00:34:34,072
Sometimes we love people even though they're messy.

742
00:34:35,572 --> 00:34:38,576
I-- how do we fire her if she's already on set?

743
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:42,213
- Somebody please inform me. - Who gonna check me, boo?

744
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:44,415
I think that we have officially made our decision then.

745
00:34:44,448 --> 00:34:47,384
- Yeah. - Okay, let's go ahead and  send them to the video lab

746
00:34:47,417 --> 00:34:50,788
<i> so I can let them know how they did.</i>

747
00:35:04,768 --> 00:35:07,138
( beeping )

748
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:09,507
- Hi, Ashley. - Hi, James.

749
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:13,744
Your extraterrestrial look was out of this world.

750
00:35:13,777 --> 00:35:17,214
Congratulations, you are the winner of today's elimination challenge.

751
00:35:17,247 --> 00:35:19,683
Wow, thank you, James. Thank you so much.

752
00:35:19,716 --> 00:35:22,353
Thank you, and we are so excited to see more.

753
00:35:22,386 --> 00:35:24,489
- You're on to next week. - Thank you.

754
00:35:27,491 --> 00:35:29,293
The first.

755
00:35:34,231 --> 00:35:36,767
- Hi, Benny. - Hey. Hi, James.

756
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,171
The judges and I loved your neon club kid look,

757
00:35:40,204 --> 00:35:41,906
even with the flowers.

758
00:35:41,939 --> 00:35:44,708
It's been really incredible to see your personality blossom.

759
00:35:44,741 --> 00:35:46,210
You're on to next week.

760
00:35:46,243 --> 00:35:48,646
Thank you, so, so, so much.

761
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:51,649
It's Britney, bitch.

762
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:54,618
You're here. I'm so happy.

763
00:35:54,651 --> 00:35:56,620
- I told you. - I need to stop overthinking.

764
00:35:56,653 --> 00:35:58,889
I know. That's two times in a row now.

765
00:35:58,922 --> 00:36:00,491
( sighs )

766
00:36:00,524 --> 00:36:02,760
- Hi, Kailin. - Hi, James.

767
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:06,297
I'm not gonna lie to you, I was very, very worried

768
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,798
about the direction of your look.

769
00:36:07,831 --> 00:36:09,466
This is your first time doing drag,

770
00:36:09,499 --> 00:36:13,470
and you took a major, major risk.

771
00:36:13,503 --> 00:36:16,507
- Yeah. - But it paid off.

772
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,943
You're on to next week.

773
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:20,545
Thank you so much, James.

774
00:36:22,646 --> 00:36:24,815
- Oh! I need to, like,  touch the ground. - Oh, my God.

775
00:36:24,848 --> 00:36:27,585
- Ugh. - Yes.

776
00:36:30,587 --> 00:36:33,991
You guys! Oh!

777
00:36:34,024 --> 00:36:36,894
I was really freaking out for some reason.

778
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:48,606
I definitely feel like I am in jeopardy of going home.

779
00:36:49,706 --> 00:36:50,841
I cannot go home

780
00:36:50,874 --> 00:36:53,010
on a drag transformation challenge.

781
00:36:53,043 --> 00:36:54,612
( knocking )

782
00:36:59,416 --> 00:37:01,385
James: Hi, Indigo.

783
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:07,424
- Hey! - Hello!

784
00:37:07,457 --> 00:37:08,692
- It's you. - Oh, my gosh.

785
00:37:08,725 --> 00:37:10,962
- You're on the way. - You're here.

786
00:37:12,462 --> 00:37:14,465
I wanted to come and talk to you.

787
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:17,534
Unfortunately, in comparison to the other contestants today,

788
00:37:17,567 --> 00:37:19,370
the judges and I have decided

789
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:21,705
that your look was the weakest and we have to send you home.

790
00:37:21,738 --> 00:37:23,974
I need you to not be too hard on yourself

791
00:37:24,007 --> 00:37:27,878
because you are so insanely talented, it's, like-- it's beyond.

792
00:37:27,911 --> 00:37:30,648
I am so proud of what you've done so far in this competition.

793
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:32,950
Although you did not win this challenge today or the competition,

794
00:37:32,983 --> 00:37:34,551
I'm wanna make it so clear to you, Indigo,

795
00:37:34,584 --> 00:37:36,720
I do think you have what it takes to be a star,

796
00:37:36,753 --> 00:37:39,723
and I'm so excited to see what you have to offer.

797
00:37:39,756 --> 00:37:42,526
( sighs ) At least I went home a queen.

798
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:45,396
Yes! That is the attitude to have.

799
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:46,630
Oh, my God. Give me a hug.

800
00:37:46,663 --> 00:37:48,732
- Love you, James. - Love you, too.

801
00:37:48,765 --> 00:37:52,569
Okay, before I send you home, let's go ahead and sign off together, okay?

802
00:37:52,602 --> 00:37:53,937
- All right. - Right to the camera.

803
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:56,507
- All right. - All right, you guys,

804
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,574
thank you so much for watching

805
00:37:57,607 --> 00:37:59,677
"Instant Influencer" episode two.

806
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:01,078
I'm joined here with Indigo.

807
00:38:01,111 --> 00:38:02,946
You guys, he is such an incredibly talented artist,

808
00:38:02,979 --> 00:38:04,415
and you have to go check him out.

809
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:06,016
Where can they find you?

810
00:38:06,049 --> 00:38:09,920

811
00:38:09,953 --> 00:38:13,624
