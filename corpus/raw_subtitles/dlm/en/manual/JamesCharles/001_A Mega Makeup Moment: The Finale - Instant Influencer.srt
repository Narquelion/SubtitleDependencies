<i> James Charles: This season on "Instant Influencer"... </i>

2
00:00:04,871 --> 00:00:07,107
Hi, sisters! James Charles here,

3
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:09,676
and today I have something extra special for you.

4
00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:12,445
<i> We started the competition with six artists... </i>

5
00:00:12,545 --> 00:00:15,248
I can't believe I'm here, and I'm just so happy right now.

6
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:17,250
James: Whoa!

7
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,651
How long did this makeup look take you today?

8
00:00:18,751 --> 00:00:22,322
- I woke up at 12:30. - Oh, my God.

9
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:24,157
<i> ...and we're now down to our final three. </i>

10
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:26,359
- Final three! - Yeah!

11
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:29,796
-<i> Ashley. </i> - The winner of today's  Compact Challenge is Ashley.

12
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:33,199
- ( gasps ) - My top of the week  is Ashley.

13
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:36,102
- Two challenges  in a row, baby. -<i> Benny. </i>

14
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:38,338
- You are the winner of  today's Compact Challenge. - Yay!

15
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:40,240
Oh, my gosh. I have a win.

16
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,209
- I think you're a star. - Thank you so much.  That means a lot.

17
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:45,645
-<i> And Kailin. </i> - You did the best in  today's challenge.

18
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:48,415
Congratulation, Kailin, you are the winner.

19
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:51,684
- All right! - You turned this out,  you ( bleep ) whore.

20
00:00:51,784 --> 00:00:54,154
Thank you! I feel amazing!

21
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:55,688
-<i> With 50... </i> - ( sobbing )

22
00:00:55,788 --> 00:00:58,124
-<i> thousand... </i> - Oh, my God. I made it.

23
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:00,360
-<i> dollars on the line... </i> - ( screaming )

24
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,195
Oh, my God!

25
00:01:02,295 --> 00:01:04,164
<i> ...it all comes down to this. </i>

26
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:06,332
You guys want to be trendsetters, not followers.

27
00:01:06,432 --> 00:01:09,436
Kailin: This is something that could completely change my life.

28
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:12,105
-<i> It's now... </i> - Ashley: This is a disaster.

29
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:14,374
- Let's go! -<i> ...or never. </i>

30
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:17,343
- James: I'm a little bit  worried with this. - I don't know what to do.

31
00:01:17,443 --> 00:01:19,379
I'm stressing out.

32
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:21,214
- Why you taking  everything off? - Mother--

33
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:24,317
I wish I had my son here. This is it. I have to nail this.

34
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:28,188
- I am a badass bitch. - Time is up. Stop working.

35
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:30,123
- I think we have  a final decision. - We do.

36
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:33,093
- Yup. - Benny: The way that this  will feel complete

37
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:34,861
- is if I win. - But in the end,

38
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:37,564
only one can become

39
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:40,366
an "Instant Influencer."

40
00:01:40,466 --> 00:01:43,670
Waking up this morning, I feel ready.

41
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,739
Being a young mom is challenging in a lot of ways.

42
00:01:46,839 --> 00:01:49,209
- How old was I when I had you? - 16.

43
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:51,811
- Straight up, right? - But in retrospect,

44
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:54,881
it let's me have kind of like a tunnel vision on any goal that I want.

45
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:56,749
All I'm thinking about is winning,

46
00:01:56,849 --> 00:01:58,418
and all of the things on the line.

47
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:00,520
I can't believe how much is at stake.

48
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,455
I want to find out what the challenge is, like, right now.

49
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:05,258
I'm ready to compete and I'm ready to win this.

50
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:06,759
Period.

51
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:10,230
Benny: I cannot believe I made it to the top.

52
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,233
I'm literally a senior in high school

53
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,368
from a tiny town in Pennsylvania,

54
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,670
and it's so, so, so hard

55
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,773
to have opportunities like this competition.

56
00:02:20,873 --> 00:02:23,910
And I'm in the finale. That is crazy.

57
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,846
Out of thousands of people, I was one of the six.

58
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:29,649
But now I'm one of the three.

59
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:33,753
I do not have words to express how happy I am from this experience.

60
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:37,757
This has been the craziest ride of my life.

61
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:42,629
Each week I have been tested, and everything that we have done has made me so strong.

62
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:44,931
I am so honored that I have made it this far,

63
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:49,302
but I am not leaving until people know what I stand for and who I am.

64
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:56,342
- Good morning, my final three. - All: Good morning.

65
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:58,478
Before we jump in today, I just want to say to all three of you,

66
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:00,513
I am so incredibly proud of you guys

67
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:03,316
and the journeys that we have been on the past few weeks together.

68
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,952
This has been such an incredible experience for me that I will never forget

69
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:08,721
and I hope all of you guys feel the same exact way.

70
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:11,357
- All: Yes. - Regardless of  the outcome of today,

71
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:13,593
You all three are beauty superstars.

72
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:17,263
At the end of last week, I did tell you guys I wanted you to think big.

73
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:20,600
And because of that, we are focusing on just the elimination challenge today.

74
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,835
Today there is no Compact Challenge.

75
00:03:22,935 --> 00:03:25,338
- That means that  there's no advantage. - Fair.

76
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:27,507
Staying on top of trends and creating trends

77
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:31,511
is arguably the most valuable skill an influencer can have.

78
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:33,680
Over the past few years, there have been countless looks

79
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,849
to go extremely viral that had the beauty community gagging,

80
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:39,219
and suddenly everyone was recreating them.

81
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:41,321
The Bratz challenge, Bob Ross paintings,

82
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:42,589
my palette campaign looks,

83
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:45,258
and so many other creative concepts.

84
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:47,860
So, for today, I'm challenging you guys

85
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:52,298
to create the next mega makeup moment.

86
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:53,800
Whoa.

87
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,470
James wants us to create the next mega makeup moment?

88
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,739
Are you kidding me? They're a bit unpredictable.

89
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:02,508
Trying to just create one on the fly,

90
00:04:02,608 --> 00:04:04,477
is really hard.

91
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:07,013
But there's so much at stake today,

92
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:09,716
so, yeah, I'm definitely ready for this.

93
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:12,852
For this challenge, you guys are going to have three hours

94
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:16,256
to brainstorm and create your makeup looks.

95
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:20,026
And an additional 45 minutes with my personal photographer,

96
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:21,728
where you will get to be your own creative director

97
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:23,730
to shoot and select your final photos

98
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,565
- for deliberation. - Ooh.

99
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:28,001
We have a full studio set up with lots of backdrops, props.

100
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:31,771
So we want you guys to get creative and do whatever you want.

101
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:36,276
For these looks today, I need you guys to go bold.

102
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:38,611
On the line, just to remind you guys,

103
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:40,380
is a full lighting and video package

104
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,814
to make your content gorgeous,

105
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:44,017
a collaboration video with me,

106
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:47,620
and also, $50,000.

107
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:52,659
And only one can be our first-ever "Instant Influencer."

108
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:56,029
Benny: It feels amazing to be at the end of this competition.

109
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:59,365
That means that I'm really talented and I belong here.

110
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:03,436
I made it this far, and I'm so much closer to achieving my dreams.

111
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:07,407
Winning this whole competition would mean everything to me.

112
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:10,643
Enough of the emotions, though, because we have a challenge to do.

113
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:11,878
Remember to blend,

114
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:15,682
but don't blend in.

115
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,984
Artists, your final challenge starts right...

116
00:05:20,719 --> 00:05:22,422
...now!

117
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:25,458
Good luck, you guys.

118
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:28,795
I came here for a reason and I am ready to be crowned Instant Influencer.

119
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:32,465
But coming up with the idea is the most challenging part about this.

120
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:35,468
It needs to be simple, and it needs to be trendy,

121
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:37,704
and it needs to be something that people can recreate.

122
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:39,806
I need to start strategizing ASAP.

123
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:41,774
- Are you guys nervous? - Benny: I'm not nervous.

124
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:43,976
I'm mostly excited because I've been wanting

125
00:05:44,076 --> 00:05:46,679
to do this look for a hot minute.

126
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:49,415
- So you already have  something in mind, Benny? - Yeah, I've been having

127
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:52,685
- it in mind since I even got  on the plane to come here. - What?

128
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:55,655
- Tell me your idea, Benny.  I'm joking. - Okay, so do you know those--

129
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:57,790
- Oh, you're serious. - What?

130
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:00,927
- Benny, this is a competition. - Oh.

131
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,062
I'm going to do something very unique, very big,

132
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:06,499
and I'm so excited to finally put together

133
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:09,469
a look that I've been wanting to do for so long.

134
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:11,504
And I cannot wait to impress the judges

135
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:14,140
'cause I feel like this look is the one.

136
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,143
I'm about sick of looking like a rat on camera,

137
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:19,979
- I'll tell you that. - Girl, you look good  with/without makeup.

138
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:22,415
- You look good in every angle. - Thank you.

139
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:25,752
- What about you, Kailin,  are you nervous? - No, I'm not.

140
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:27,720
I had, like, a realization last night

141
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,456
that I am a badass bitch.

142
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,725
I had, like, this light bulb that went off.

143
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:36,763
Like, I cannot let myself get bogged down by my own self-doubt.

144
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:40,700
Like, I think I realized I'm so worried all the time

145
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,736
of other people's opinions, that, like, I stifle--

146
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:47,039
I allow myself to stifle myself creatively. You know what I mean?

147
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:50,410
- Yeah. - I've just realized that  I know exactly who I am.

148
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,811
I know exactly what I want to do.

149
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,713
( whispering ) Perfect. Not enough. Too much.

150
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:55,515
Beauty is from within.

151
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:56,983
Beauty is being able to embrace yourself

152
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,651
and love yourself for every flaw that you have.

153
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,887
So I wanted to come up with a trend

154
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:04,424
that would inspire people to love themselves more.

155
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:07,560
I got this idea of words going down the cheeks.

156
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,996
And I thought one side could represent

157
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,731
who you are perceived as.

158
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:14,033
( whispering ) Not enough. Too much. Naive.

159
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:15,635
And then on the other side,

160
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:17,937
this is the side that is you.

161
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:20,039
( whispering ) Creative, sexy, strong, intuitive.

162
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:23,209
Okay, that's got to be enough.

163
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:25,578
- I'm so excited for mine. - Okay, I want to go

164
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:28,214
for a really hot red lip for this look, 'cause this--

165
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:30,850
even though I don't like red lips, I'm gonna make it work.

166
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,786
Oh! Perfect.

167
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:36,889
An X-acto knife. Be careful. Don't try this at home.

168
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:39,158
I feel like people are going to think I'm so inappropriate

169
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:42,628
'cause I'm going for a kinky bunny look, but I'm not that inappropriate, I swear.

170
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:46,098
Oh, my God! Ahh!

171
00:07:46,198 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm like, in my head right now.

172
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,969
Ashley: As I'm brainstorming for this Viral Trend Challenge,

173
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:51,571
I'm trying to keep in mind

174
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:54,140
what is actually trendy right now.

175
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,108
I am very inspired by fashion,

176
00:07:56,208 --> 00:07:58,711
so one of the most trendy brands right now

177
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,213
is the Off-White brand,

178
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,948
which has completely stripped down

179
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:04,183
the concept of fashion to very simplistic labels.

180
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:06,819
I felt what they did with fashion,

181
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:08,054
I could do with makeup,

182
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,856
and it would translate immediately.

183
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:12,959
I'm about to look crazy at first.

184
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:14,961
I hope this works.

185
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:18,097
However, it is an idea that already exists.

186
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:21,767
If this doesn't come off as original, I could completely lose this competition.

187
00:08:21,867 --> 00:08:26,138
- So, how you feeling, Ash? - I'm a little bit nervous about  my concept, to be honest.

188
00:08:26,238 --> 00:08:29,742
I wish I had my son here to ask him if this idea was a good one.

189
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:32,512
( sighs ) These ears are taking so much time.

190
00:08:34,112 --> 00:08:36,883
- Oh, I love that. - ♪ Oh ♪

191
00:08:39,885 --> 00:08:41,954
- Hello, you guys! - What's up, James?

192
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:44,857
Hello, hello. We are about 30 minutes in, so I wanted to come on by.

193
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:47,593
- Let me start with Kailin.  Hello, beautiful. - Hi.

194
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,629
- Do you wanna talk  over there? - Yeah.

195
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:53,666
James does really set, like, 80% of the trends in this business,

196
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:56,002
and I am excited to hear what he has to say

197
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:59,238
because I know that this trend, with the message behind it,

198
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:02,808
could really empower people, and there is nothing better than that.

199
00:09:02,908 --> 00:09:05,278
I don't want to take up too much of your time, so quickly walk me through it.

200
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,848
It seems that you're gonna be doing writing on the cheeks and then flowers and glitter?

201
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:11,684
I believe that beauty is loving yourself and embracing yourself for your flaws.

202
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:14,654
- Oh, fully. Yeah. - Basically saying,  "Eff you."

203
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:15,721
- Like, "I'm gonna be me,"  kind of thing? - Yep.

204
00:09:19,891 --> 00:09:20,893
Yeah, okay.

205
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:26,198
Okay, well, you know, some of the most successful trends

206
00:09:26,298 --> 00:09:28,701
that we've seen go viral on Instagram or on YouTube

207
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:30,970
have really been the ones that have a message behind them,

208
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,338
so this seems really good.

209
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:35,274
Just to let you know "naive" is spelled N-A-I-V-E,

210
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:37,843
and its-- there's two little dots over the "I."

211
00:09:37,943 --> 00:09:39,178
There's two dots over "naive"?

212
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:43,883
It's N-A-I with two dots.

213
00:09:47,285 --> 00:09:49,755
This is "nieve," which is "snow" in Spanish, so...

214
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:53,926
- Correct that before you  draw them on your face. - Thank you.

215
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:56,896
- You're welcome. Good luck. - Clearly, I can't spell.

216
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:58,764
Oh, I'm a fool.

217
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:00,900
- Okay, what-- - I know.

218
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,969
- What exactly is going on here? - It's going to come together.

219
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:04,937
- Okay. - This is actually what  I had a question about,

220
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:07,073
because if this is a no, then I'm going to completely change my concept,

221
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:09,375
- which I'm kind of  freaking out about. - This is new for you,

222
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:11,711
- freaking out. Okay. - I'm a little bit nervous.

223
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:14,246
So, I know that trends are typically inspired by, like, everything that's relevant

224
00:10:14,346 --> 00:10:15,748
and brands have a lot to do with that.

225
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:19,919
I know that we cannot put actual brand names,

226
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:21,787
- but can it be  inspired by them? - Yes.

227
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:24,190
- Does that make sense? Boom. - Yeah, that's definitely fine.

228
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,659
There's clever ways you can tiptoe around everything,

229
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,995
- as long as you're not-- - That's what I thought.  I was going to do--

230
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:31,364
I just wanted to make sure it wasn't going to be a total sister lawsuit.

231
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,899
- We don't wanna sister-sue. - No sister-suing.

232
00:10:33,999 --> 00:10:37,903
Yes! I'm so relieved James thinks that this is a great idea.

233
00:10:38,003 --> 00:10:40,072
- I'm gonna go for it. - I'm so excited. Thank you.

234
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:41,407
- Good luck. Thank you. - Yay!

235
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:45,911
Okay, so I had this idea in my head for weeks,

236
00:10:46,011 --> 00:10:48,881
- and I'm so happy I finally  get to, like, create it. - Yeah.

237
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,283
It's a mixture of, like, this bunny mask,

238
00:10:51,383 --> 00:10:54,787
where it's kind of like what Ariana Grande wore in "Dangerous Woman."

239
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:56,422
- Mm-hmm. - And then for  the rest of my face,

240
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:58,290
I'm gonna actually be a bunny.

241
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:01,127
- So it's like a bunny  wearing the mask. - Okay.

242
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:05,965
I'm a little bit worried with this because it is very,

243
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:08,668
very similar to what Ari wore in that music video.

244
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:13,139
- What's your  messaging behind it? - Um...

245
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:15,675
- I'm not sure. - You need to come up  with your concept

246
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:17,309
and you need to have a strong message behind it.

247
00:11:17,409 --> 00:11:18,878
That's what's going to sell it and that's what's going to make

248
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:21,881
the audience want to love it and also recreate it.

249
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:25,818
And I'm worried that almost like this look, you're hiding behind this,

250
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:27,453
- like, Benny mask. - Yeah.

251
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:31,157
And I want to see Benny as a person because we love Benny.

252
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:33,826
So think of your look, think of what I just told you about you

253
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:35,761
and showing us who Benny truly is,

254
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,263
because this is a good start,

255
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,099
but I want to see you create something unique, all right?

256
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,701
- All right. - I don't want to take up  too much of your time

257
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:42,868
- because the clock is ticking. - Thank you so much.

258
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:44,737
- But good luck, okay? - Okay.

259
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:47,239
Benny: What James told me kind of threw me off

260
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:48,774
because I have no other idea.

261
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,810
And I already have my ears made,

262
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,978
and those took some time to make, and effort.

263
00:11:53,078 --> 00:11:55,347
You guys, I'm gonna tell everybody this just like I just told Benny.

264
00:11:55,447 --> 00:11:57,450
You want these looks to be unique.

265
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,152
You guys want to be trendsetters, not followers.

266
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:02,388
And remember you guys, there's $50,000 on the line here.

267
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,490
- Got it, James. - Got it. Thank you!

268
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,858
Good luck. I'll see you guys in a little bit. Thank you!

269
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,260
Benny: I don't know what to do.

270
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,029
I'm stressing out.

271
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:12,898
This is not good. Like, this is bad.

272
00:12:16,234 --> 00:12:18,771
- I don't know what to do now. - What did he say?

273
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:21,507
He was like, "It's not original because Ariana Grande did it."

274
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:24,210
- And... - I would listen  to what he said.

275
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:27,346
That's the only thing I'm gonna say.

276
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:29,215
I mean, he is literally the one that's gonna be judging your look.

277
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:32,118
You could put a spin on what you've created,

278
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:35,421
because you were really passionate about creating that.

279
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:37,356
James thinks my look is unoriginal,

280
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:40,459
but it's my fault for not explaining it thoroughly.

281
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:44,530
So I'm writing down what I think the look means to me and why it's unique.

282
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,932
And I'm just gonna go with it even though

283
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:49,101
I know I'm taking a risk continuing this look.

284
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:51,270
Do you, boo.

285
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:54,974
Benny's weakness is that his concepts typically don't make much sense,

286
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:58,277
or at least they don't relate to what he's trying to portray.

287
00:12:58,377 --> 00:13:00,946
Look at my hair. Ooh.

288
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:02,481
My hair's so slick.

289
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:05,484
( gasps ) The devil is upon us!

290
00:13:05,584 --> 00:13:08,487
And Kailin is my girl, but she is a hot mess.

291
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:09,789
What did you just do?

292
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:14,960
So at this point, I'm feeling pretty good.

293
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,430
I have never done precision work like this before.

294
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:20,132
I thought that the three hours would be no big deal

295
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:22,368
because my idea is a very simple idea.

296
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:26,806
- But I have never written  letters on a face. - My God, this is scary.

297
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:30,075
And the liner is really hard to work with

298
00:13:30,175 --> 00:13:33,479
- because it's a felt tip. - Mother--

299
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:37,383
- You all right over there? - And I see that Ashley's  also writing on her face.

300
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,819
And I'm a little bit, like, "Oh crap."

301
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:42,288
I'm gonna spell something wrong.

302
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:46,192
Kailin: But I know that my idea is so unique,

303
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:47,526
because this look is so personal to me.

304
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:51,197
Does that look right reading it downward? N-O-S?

305
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:55,000
- Yeah. - Okay. I'm, like,  so stressed.

306
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,070
- I got you, girl. - Benny: I love them so much,

307
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,073
but the other girls are just doing writings on their face.

308
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,309
My look involves a lot of techniques.

309
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:07,413
I'm literally putting cotton on my face with spirit gum.

310
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:10,049
- That's commitment. - I can't breathe  out of my nose.

311
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:14,620
- Holy shit. - And I feel like that's what  makes an Instant Influencer,

312
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,091
someone who will risk their own skin to do a look.

313
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,259
Let me see.

314
00:14:23,061 --> 00:14:25,164
What is happening?

315
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:27,600
- That looks really good, Benny. - Thank you.

316
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,035
Why does this look green?

317
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:32,338
I'm getting a little worried about the eyes because I've got flowers

318
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:34,506
going on on this side, I've got gems going on this side.

319
00:14:34,606 --> 00:14:38,377
It's a little busy. I'm hoping that they get the idea

320
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:41,380
that the eyes are also part of my story.

321
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,451
If not, they might think this just looks like a hot mess.

322
00:14:53,191 --> 00:14:55,594
I don't know how I'm going to put these ears on.

323
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:58,631
I'm just gonna put a shit-ton of spirit gum.

324
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:02,101
And I'm just going to put it right here.

325
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:05,037
The ears are not sticking to my head.

326
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:07,640
This isn't staying. This isn't good.

327
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,676
And I feel like since I have no time, I'm literally just rushing

328
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:13,345
and doing whatever I can to get it done.

329
00:15:16,648 --> 00:15:19,151
Even though I feel comfortable with my look and the trend,

330
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:22,554
today's the finale and I'm so close to winning.

331
00:15:22,654 --> 00:15:25,391
But if my ears fall off, it could ruin the look.

332
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:27,459
I have duct tape in my hair, but I really don't care.

333
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:33,532
- I'll be fine with my $50,000. - Shots fired.

334
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:37,102
Hopefully they stay on. That's all I'm asking for.

335
00:15:42,507 --> 00:15:46,011
Artists, you guys have about 10 minutes remaining.

336
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,680
Don't forget, you have a photoshoot after,

337
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,382
so you want to make sure your makeup is perfect, and ready to go,

338
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:53,085
- and camera ready. - Ashley: James coming  through calling "time"

339
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:55,721
- is giving me serious anxiety. - What do you guys think?

340
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:58,958
- You think it looks finished? - Like, no shade, Benny, but  please stop talking to me.

341
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:01,260
This is, like, all the pressure in the world right now

342
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,728
and I just need to get this done.

343
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:08,233
I'm running out of time and just writing the words

344
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:11,437
is a lot more difficult than I anticipated.

345
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:15,607
About to make a split-second decision.

346
00:16:15,707 --> 00:16:18,043
I realize I'm in over my head with my original concept.

347
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:22,414
Let's hope this works.

348
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:24,750
I'm not going to be able to execute these words

349
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:28,220
on both sides of my face and still have enough time to create this look,

350
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,023
and so I decide that I'm going to create

351
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:33,559
half of my face transparent.

352
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:34,994
Why you taking everything off?

353
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:37,162
Ashley: This is a disaster.

354
00:16:38,663 --> 00:16:41,266
Oh, baby. Oh, Lord.

355
00:16:41,366 --> 00:16:43,535
This is very creative, honestly.

356
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:45,471
Did the lash get stuck in my hair?

357
00:16:45,571 --> 00:16:48,407
Luckily, Off-White incorporates a lot of clear

358
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:51,343
and transparent materials into their brand, so I hope

359
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:53,145
that this really translates the way I want it to.

360
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:55,781
But in order to really finish my look,

361
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:59,318
I decide that I'm going to create a zip-tie.

362
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:01,620
I really hope that the judges get it.

363
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,057
Just when I think I'm getting organized, I lose a lash.

364
00:17:06,391 --> 00:17:07,659
Thought I was going to be a mummy.

365
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:09,328
This is like Charmin Ultra Quilt.

366
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:11,363
- Oh, shoot. - Four.

367
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:14,533
Three, two, one.

368
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:17,569
Artists, your time is up. Stop working.

369
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:20,172
All right, you guys, well, it is now photoshoot time.

370
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:22,174
You are going to have 45 minutes each

371
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:25,110
with my good friend and personal photographer John Sams.

372
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,312
We did a random selection and, Kailin,

373
00:17:27,412 --> 00:17:29,348
- you will get to go first. - All right.

374
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:31,750
- Good luck putting  together your photo. - Thanks, you guys.

375
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,719
And we will see you guys at the judging panel.

376
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:38,057
- Hi! - Hi. I'm Jon.

377
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:40,359
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.  This looks gorgeous.

378
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:42,828
- Oh, my gosh, thank you. - What are you thinking of  doing for your shoot?

379
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:44,563
I want these balloons right here.

380
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:46,131
- I want this crown. - Cool.

381
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,067
Kailin: For my photoshoot, I really want it

382
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:49,401
to kind of show that, like, I'm an open book.

383
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:51,703
So what is the half and half?

384
00:17:51,803 --> 00:17:54,406
It's things people think versus what I am.

385
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:58,243
So I love the crown. With that storyline, I'd put it more on the--

386
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:01,280
- This side? - The side that you're  feeling and living with.

387
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:04,450
- Okay. That's a good point. - Perfect. Right there.

388
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,223
Kailin: For the first time in this entire competition,

389
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:14,193
I actually think that there's a chance that I could win this,

390
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:16,562
which is crazy to think because I really,

391
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:20,766
truly did not believe that I deserved a spot in the top six.

392
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:23,802
And for me to have made it to the finale,

393
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:25,838
like, I'm really grateful.

394
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,573
I think that this is the one.

395
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:29,875
- That's the one? - That one. Got it. Done.

396
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:32,111
- This one? Perfect. - Let's go!

397
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:33,378
Oh, my gosh.

398
00:18:33,478 --> 00:18:35,180
So what's the whole idea with your look?

399
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,584
Very flirty and very fun, but also very liberating

400
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:40,319
and feeling, like, letting go of all stress.

401
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:42,521
Yeah, I mean, a glitter red lip is always liberating.

402
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,257
Yeah, so I'm thinking, like...

403
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:47,793
- Okay, full character. - Good poses, fun pose-- yes.

404
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:49,761
I have never done a photoshoot before,

405
00:18:49,861 --> 00:18:51,797
but I feel so fierce.

406
00:18:56,501 --> 00:18:59,171
- I'm doing a cute little  bunny prancing look. - Gorgeous.

407
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:01,773
And I feel like James' photographer is living for it.

408
00:19:01,873 --> 00:19:05,277
Do you want to keep shooting or are you happy with that one?

409
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:09,214
- I like that one. - I'm very confident  with the shot I chose

410
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:12,251
because I felt this one was perfect.

411
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:13,485
Yep, that's me.

412
00:19:16,521 --> 00:19:19,625
I know James said to go big, but I do kind of want to see

413
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:21,360
what this ruler is gonna look like,

414
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,228
'cause the ruler is what's gonna be kind of here,

415
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,631
- like, measuring my profile. - Grab it. Play with it. Yeah.

416
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:27,933
I am getting a little bit nervous that my concept

417
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:30,302
isn't going to translate as thinking big

418
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:32,905
because it's white minimalist.

419
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,239
Chin up just a bit.

420
00:19:36,641 --> 00:19:38,443
- Let me see what  that angle looks like. - Yeah, go for it.

421
00:19:38,543 --> 00:19:41,647
Mm, I kind of like that better.

422
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:45,350
- Do you want to say  you're good? - Um, wait a minute.

423
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,820
- What? - I see this black tape,  and I come up with an idea.

424
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,523
I want to put two black here and then two black here,

425
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:53,659
but, like, as even as possible.

426
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:56,695
These quotations are going to tie this whole photoshoot together,

427
00:19:56,795 --> 00:20:00,232
and give all of the minimalistic attributes to this a purpose.

428
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,902
( gasps )

429
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:05,671
That looks ( bleep ) cool as shit.

430
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:07,673
- Lock it, that's it. - Lock it?

431
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:09,374
- That's it.  Yep, that's the one. - Lock it down.

432
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:11,543
- Hands up. - High-five.

433
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:16,315
I want to win this for my son.

434
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:18,317
I want my son to be a passionate person

435
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,586
who does what he wants to do and chases his dream

436
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:23,422
and isn't afraid of failure or to take risks,

437
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:26,792
and it finally sinks in-- this is it.

438
00:20:31,362 --> 00:20:33,599
Hello, artists, and welcome to the judging

439
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:35,500
of your final elimination challenge

440
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,370
of "Instant Influencer." This is it, you guys.

441
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:39,871
How does it feel to be here for the last time?

442
00:20:39,971 --> 00:20:42,674
- Amazing. It feels great. - It's bittersweet.

443
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:45,544
I am so incredibly proud of each and every single one of you.

444
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:48,780
It has been such a pleasure watching you grow over the past few weeks,

445
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,984
and I want all three of you to know that nobody is truly going home a loser.

446
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:55,020
From this, I will hope that you guys will get to grow your platforms,

447
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,756
artistry, and of course, your skill set.

448
00:20:57,856 --> 00:21:00,759
I am so excited to see your photos that you guys prepared for us today,

449
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:04,329
but I'm even more thrilled to watch your journeys after the show

450
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:05,797
and see what your true potential is.

451
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:08,000
Benny: This experience has been life-changing.

452
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,570
No one in my small town has ever made it this big like me,

453
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:14,573
so I'm definitely going to be the word around the street.

454
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:16,675
Before we jump in for the last time this season,

455
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,411
I want to tell you guys about our judges for today.

456
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:20,946
Since this was a trend challenge,

457
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:23,915
who better to join us than Mario Dedivanovic?

458
00:21:24,015 --> 00:21:26,618
- Hey, guys. - Mario is a celebrity  makeup artist

459
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:29,054
who has created some of Kim K's most memorable looks

460
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:32,424
- that we all know and love. - Um, "the" Mario?

461
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:35,694
Like, I don't even know what to do right now.

462
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:38,397
Like, he invented Kim. He literally birthed her.

463
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:40,699
Also, you guys know Norvina by now.

464
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,601
She's the president and creative director of one of the biggest

465
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:47,339
and trendiest makeup brands in the entire world.

466
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:51,877
Tonight, only one of you can get the title of our first ever Instant Influencer,

467
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,913
a full lighting and video package to make your videos beautiful,

468
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:57,516
a collaboration with me on my YouTube channel,

469
00:21:57,616 --> 00:22:00,952
and finally, $50,000.

470
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,089
All right, artists, let's take a look

471
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:05,791
at your final photos from today,

472
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:09,961
and hopefully, a mega makeup moment will happen.

473
00:22:10,061 --> 00:22:11,730
Ashley, you're gonna go first.

474
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,700
Kailin and Benny, you guys can take a seat.

475
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,101
This is the most high pressure challenge.

476
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:18,437
Not only is this the final challenge,

477
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:21,373
but it was basically creating a moment out of this air.

478
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:24,443
And the fact that one of my idols is sitting right in front of me

479
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:28,046
and about to judge me on this is really, really nerve-wracking.

480
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:30,816
All right, Ashley, let's see your image for today.

481
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:35,887
Oh! Wow, this is stunning.

482
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:38,724
Tell us about this look today.

483
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:41,560
So, this is inspired by the Off-White clothing brand.

484
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,830
I really like the concept of stripping fashion down to just, like, labels,

485
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,099
and so I decided to do that, but with my face.

486
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,501
Okay, I do want to commend you on this photo composition

487
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:51,903
'cause I think it is super, super cool.

488
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:54,439
This is definitely something I would want to recreate for my Instagram.

489
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:55,841
I'm sure, like, you guys could both imagine me

490
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:58,143
doing something like this on my feed.

491
00:22:58,243 --> 00:22:59,978
I personally love Off-White stuff.

492
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:03,148
I also love the addition of the DIY little earring as well

493
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:06,485
- to match the hang-ties.  Super, super cool. - Thank you.

494
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:11,056
But why is your face painted a lighter shade on your right hand side?

495
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:13,458
- Yes. - And what made you make  this decision?

496
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:16,595
Straight black lines are really difficult to create on round surfaces.

497
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:19,598
- Very. - So, once I realized that,  I was running out of time.

498
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:21,166
And I didn't think that it would be smart

499
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:24,136
to do the letters on my whole face,

500
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:27,839
but I thought that creating this more of, like, a natural,

501
00:23:27,939 --> 00:23:32,644
you know, or clear effect on the other side would still maintain the brand aesthetic.

502
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:35,680
I would have turned just completely to the side profile.

503
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,716
Nobody would have ever known that you didn't even do the other side.

504
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:39,718
You could have fooled us all.

505
00:23:39,818 --> 00:23:41,720
I love this whole idea, and I love this who concept.

506
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,489
It's very fashion forward. It's very editorial.

507
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:47,025
- Thank you. - I think the way that  you wrote "cheek"

508
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:50,195
and the jawline and the lips-- absolutely flawless.

509
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:53,932
I think the eye area starts to get a little bit messy and confusing,

510
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:56,501
and the nose area is really what does it for me.

511
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:58,203
The art of editing is really important,

512
00:23:58,303 --> 00:24:00,539
the art of editing one's self.

513
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:01,706
I would have loved to see this

514
00:24:01,806 --> 00:24:03,074
without the quotation marks on it.

515
00:24:03,174 --> 00:24:05,076
I think it would have really cleaned it up.

516
00:24:05,176 --> 00:24:07,846
And I wish you would have just eliminated the nose altogether.

517
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,548
That would have really strengthened the look for me.

518
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:11,116
- You're right. - Norvina: First of all,

519
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:12,751
I think the look is absolutely beautiful,

520
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:15,954
and I think it could be very easily replicated,

521
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:18,190
and I think that is the key here.

522
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,826
Detail-wise, I think that much like Mario said,

523
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:22,594
there were some things that could have been cleaned up.

524
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:25,997
And I was questioning why you didn't fill in your ear

525
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:28,099
'cause I just keep staring at it the whole time.

526
00:24:28,199 --> 00:24:32,471
- I know. - I noticed you put "eye"  underneath the eye,

527
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:35,507
but "brows" plural above the one brow.

528
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:38,043
- I was that was matching. - I knew you were  gonna say that.

529
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:40,946
And then also you're missing the quotation marks from "cheek" and then also "lips".

530
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:42,948
Yes.

531
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:46,218
I knew my lines were not super clean

532
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,987
and that my letters are a bit wonky in some areas.

533
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:51,656
I just hope that the judges feel like this look

534
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:53,825
could be the next mega makeup moment.

535
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:56,661
Benny, why don't you come hop on over?

536
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:02,267
I am very, very pumped to see this photo.

537
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:04,269
Why don't we take a look?

538
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:07,005
Ooh! Very hippity-hoppity.

539
00:25:07,105 --> 00:25:09,040
Tell us about this look today and why you created it.

540
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:12,677
Okay, when we were talking earlier, and you kind of were, like,

541
00:25:12,777 --> 00:25:16,281
iffy about me doing this look, I took time afterwards

542
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:18,984
to write down why I want to do this look.

543
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:22,654
I wanted to show that I am very quiet, sweet, innocent,

544
00:25:22,754 --> 00:25:25,023
hopping all over bunny on the bottom,

545
00:25:25,123 --> 00:25:28,927
- but I'm also very fierce. - Yeah. It's like  putting on a mask.

546
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,596
I guess my whole life I've always been putting on an act

547
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:34,733
because I've been always trying to act all happy,

548
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:37,002
but I was always just very depressed

549
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:39,771
and always felt like I had nothing.

550
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:42,874
And then I came here and I felt like I'm here for a reason,

551
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:45,243
- and I matter. - You do matter.

552
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:47,846
And I'm so proud of you for realizing that and feeling that internally,

553
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:51,049
and it definitely reflects in this look today.

554
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:53,919
I'm pouring out my heart in showing this look.

555
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:56,187
I feel like the connections of my emotions

556
00:25:56,287 --> 00:25:59,724
really show the judges who I really am.

557
00:25:59,824 --> 00:26:01,560
I think it's a very successful concept,

558
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,261
and I think that the overall photo is really cute.

559
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:05,196
Did you make these ears, by the way?

560
00:26:05,296 --> 00:26:09,267
I did. I took card paper and then I covered them in black nail polish

561
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:10,869
to make them very, like, glossy.

562
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:12,337
- Nail polish? - Yeah, black nail polish.

563
00:26:12,437 --> 00:26:15,340
- Oh, that is dedication. - And super glue.

564
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,842
- And I put that on my skin. - Oh, my gosh.

565
00:26:17,942 --> 00:26:20,812
- Commitment, commitment. - I feel like the ears,

566
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:23,048
you could have just made it a lot more simple.

567
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:25,216
A piece of construction paper, some pros-aide glue

568
00:26:25,316 --> 00:26:27,352
would have stuck them on in one second.

569
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:29,220
It would have come out a lot more crisp, a lot more clean.

570
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,189
I think it could have been cleaned up a bit.

571
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:33,091
It's beautifully executed, Benny.

572
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:35,594
I think you're definitely artistic and that shows.

573
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:38,697
And how crafty to use nail polish. Can you still breathe?

574
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:42,100
When I was, like, first putting it on, I really sniffed up a lot of cotton.

575
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,269
- But commitment. - Yeah.

576
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:46,204
- Okay. - Beauty is pain.

577
00:26:46,304 --> 00:26:49,107
I'm very proud of you for putting all that work and thought into it,

578
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:53,244
- but it's not  always about that. - Mm-hmm.

579
00:26:53,344 --> 00:26:56,047
This challenge is for everyone to copy it or to recreate it.

580
00:26:56,147 --> 00:26:58,817
People want something a little easy, a little fun.

581
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:01,753
I definitely should have, like, thought of that before I started this.

582
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:02,988
- Thank you so much. - Of course.

583
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:06,091
When it comes to this makeup look,

584
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:08,126
I love what you did with the lower part of the face.

585
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:10,328
I think it's really cool and creative.

586
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:12,063
I think the textures with those colors, with the glitter lips,

587
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:13,832
it looks really fun and cute.

588
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:16,267
When I look at this look, though, I'm not seeing a trend.

589
00:27:16,367 --> 00:27:18,069
I'm seeing, like, a Halloween look.

590
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:20,271
- Mm-hmm. - A fun, little DIY  Halloween look.

591
00:27:20,371 --> 00:27:23,708
All right, maybe this is the next Halloween trend.

592
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,977
Thank you, Mario.

593
00:27:26,077 --> 00:27:27,412
( sighs )

594
00:27:27,512 --> 00:27:30,115
Okay, Kailin, show us your photo from today.

595
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:34,019
- All right. - Ooh!

596
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:37,122
- Wow. Fun! - It was a lot of fun  to create.

597
00:27:37,222 --> 00:27:41,292
It's totally subjective. On one eye you would do something that you feel

598
00:27:41,392 --> 00:27:44,062
- represents what people  see you as. - Mm-hmm.

599
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:46,398
And then on this side, you would do something that you feel you are.

600
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,800
- Yeah. - And so, the cookie cutter,

601
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,802
the not enough, and the naive,

602
00:27:50,902 --> 00:27:52,337
these are things I have been told my entire life.

603
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:55,006
People think I'm naive because I'm kind,

604
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:56,441
and I'm not kind because I'm naive.

605
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:58,143
I'm kind because I know

606
00:27:58,243 --> 00:28:00,412
what it's like to lose people you love.

607
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,947
I lost my father, I lost my best friend,

608
00:28:03,047 --> 00:28:08,153
and I am a product of alcoholism, drug use, mental abuse.

609
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:10,989
But those things, they made me who I am today.

610
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:13,258
I am no cookie cutter little white girl.

611
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:16,261
I have seen some stuff, okay?

612
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:19,698
And I am no longer going to let people stifle my creativity

613
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:23,735
because I am not this or too much of this.

614
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:27,205
- I am a bad bitch. - Thank you for sharing  all that, Kailin.

615
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:29,441
It has been a blessing getting to watch you

616
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,009
throughout this competition so far.

617
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:32,477
You are such a sweet soul.

618
00:28:32,577 --> 00:28:34,779
Moving onto your photo, I really like this.

619
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:37,015
I think that's a really cool concept and I think this is something

620
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:38,750
a lot of people would want to recreate,

621
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,819
and it would be very easy to recreate as well.

622
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:44,289
So many people have gone through not exactly the same challenges,

623
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,124
but of course, everyone has their challenges throughout their life,

624
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:48,827
and I feel like a lot of people feel misunderstood.

625
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:50,361
And this could be such a cool opportunity

626
00:28:50,461 --> 00:28:52,764
for people to really showcase their true selves.

627
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:55,500
- Yeah. - You're a beautiful girl.

628
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,203
Um, you seem very confident in person,

629
00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:00,438
but when I look at this photo, I don't see confidence.

630
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:03,208
There's a lot of things about this, though, that I do love.

631
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:05,477
I think the words underneath the eyes by itself

632
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:08,379
is really-- it has, like, a hardcore rock element.

633
00:29:08,479 --> 00:29:10,915
- Like very kind of  street raw. - Yeah.

634
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:14,119
But then it's coupled with these sort of colorful flowers on top

635
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:15,954
and they're fighting with me a little bit.

636
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:18,356
The different features are fighting with me a little bit.

637
00:29:18,456 --> 00:29:22,293
She put the side that is everything that people think of her first

638
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:25,463
and the one that represents who you really are in the back.

639
00:29:25,563 --> 00:29:27,532
So that's my one note to you,

640
00:29:27,632 --> 00:29:29,367
is if you're going to step into it, step in.

641
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:31,536
Yeah. Thank you.

642
00:29:35,372 --> 00:29:38,042
Oh. My final three artists,

643
00:29:38,142 --> 00:29:39,978
thank you guys so much for sharing your photos with us today.

644
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:42,213
You work was absolutely incredible,

645
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:43,882
and I'm really proud of you guys for taking on this challenge today.

646
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:46,484
I know it was not easy, but I think all three looks

647
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:48,853
were super cool in their own ways.

648
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:52,924
We definitely have a lot to discuss here on the judging panel,

649
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,359
and a major decision to make.

650
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,895
When you come back, one of you will be crowned

651
00:29:56,995 --> 00:30:00,265
the first ever Instant Influencer.

652
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:03,168
- Thank you, guys. - Thank you.

653
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:04,903
Thank you.

654
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:09,040
- Oh, my God. - We are almost done.

655
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,843
I literally cannot believe it.

656
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:13,244
- So crazy. - How you doing  over there, Benny?

657
00:30:13,344 --> 00:30:15,346
( groans )

658
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:17,882
Those had a time limit on them.

659
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:20,952
They really did. Let's hope these last.

660
00:30:21,052 --> 00:30:23,855
Okay, you guys, we have a really big decision in front of us.

661
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:27,425
- ( sighs ) - Why don't we start off  with Ashley?

662
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:30,595
To me, it's the one that I would definitely want to jump on and do

663
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:33,865
- because it's clean  and it's not difficult. - Yeah.

664
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:37,068
I don't feel like you have to have incredibly advanced artistry skills to do it,

665
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,970
minus the blocked brow.

666
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,306
But one of the things that is, of course, challenging

667
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:44,609
when setting a trend is it's very hard to set a brand new trend

668
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:47,145
using something that was created by somebody else.

669
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:50,148
Right. She was kind of paying an homage to or was inspired by Off-White.

670
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:52,317
- Yeah. - But I think that it  was being too literal.

671
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:54,953
Like, you can have an element, which is, like, the writing,

672
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:58,122
but it doesn't have to be the ruler and the tulle and the--

673
00:30:58,222 --> 00:30:59,524
It's too much. When you're doing an homage,

674
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:01,459
- it doesn't have to be  so identical. -Yeah.

675
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:04,562
I thought the DIY earring was so genius.

676
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:06,631
- That was genius. - Oh, my gosh.  That was such a cool idea,

677
00:31:06,731 --> 00:31:08,967
but it could have gone without the tulle and without the ruler.

678
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:10,602
- Without the tulle. - I think that would make it  a stronger photo.

679
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,504
She missed out on the quotation marks

680
00:31:13,604 --> 00:31:15,974
around the lips and the cheeks,

681
00:31:16,074 --> 00:31:17,342
and I don't think the clear element

682
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:18,543
that she was going for

683
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:19,911
really translated to the photo,

684
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:22,580
which was very surprising to me,

685
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,049
because she's usually very on top of those type of things.

686
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:26,651
I mean, she's killed it so far.

687
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:29,387
I just still want to see so much more from her.

688
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:31,089
- Isn't that good, though? - Which I guess  that's a good thing.

689
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:32,957
- It is a good thing. - If she leaves you wanting,

690
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,559
you know, to know more about her, I think that's great.

691
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:37,495
Yeah. Let's go ahead and hip-hop on over to Benny the Bunny.

692
00:31:37,595 --> 00:31:40,365
- Oh, boy. - Mario: This is hard for me

693
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:42,333
'cause there's something very endearing about Benny,

694
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:45,336
very charming, very sweet. He's easy--

695
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:47,405
he's sort of the person that's very easy to love.

696
00:31:47,505 --> 00:31:50,375
But I just didn't love the look and I didn't love the photograph.

697
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:53,645
It was not my favorite. I didn't get to see him.

698
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,680
I didn't get to see his face. I didn't get to see his eyes.

699
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,548
I didn't really get to see who Benny was.

700
00:31:57,648 --> 00:31:59,384
- Right. - I have to agree with Mario,

701
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:01,386
and I think that while this is artistic,

702
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:03,688
it can be a little scary for some.

703
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:05,556
- James: Yeah. - And definitely not something

704
00:32:05,656 --> 00:32:07,592
that I would run out and want to replicate.

705
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:09,694
But at least the character

706
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:11,429
had a really good explanation behind it.

707
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:13,665
Yes. I think a lot of what Benny is lacking

708
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:16,401
is just an understanding and a read

709
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:18,937
on what it means to be influential.

710
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:21,439
But he's also very young. You have to understand he's 18 years old,

711
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:24,309
and I just think if you can imagine

712
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:26,110
all if the little boys out there around the world

713
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:28,479
- that have a similar  story to him... - Yeah.

714
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:29,714
...that could relate to him.

715
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:31,582
So I do think influencer-wise,

716
00:32:31,682 --> 00:32:33,584
I do think that he has the potential

717
00:32:33,684 --> 00:32:36,120
to be a really great and powerful influencer.

718
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:40,224
Agreed. Let's go ahead and move on to Kailin.

719
00:32:40,324 --> 00:32:43,962
Wow. Kailin's story today was very surprising

720
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:46,331
because this is the first time throughout the competition--

721
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:47,532
- 'cause, Mario,  you haven't been here... - Yeah.

722
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,434
that she has really opened up.

723
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:51,269
I even started to get emotional.

724
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:53,738
In terms of the actual photograph composition,

725
00:32:53,838 --> 00:32:56,207
Kailin's was by far my favorite of the three.

726
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,376
- It felt very  "Euphoria" to me. - Yeah.

727
00:32:58,476 --> 00:32:59,744
- Which is very  trendy right now... - Very.

728
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:01,512
...and that's the point of the challenge.

729
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:04,716
I also thought the overall concept is really cool.

730
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:07,385
That part I thought was cool. It was just the flowers and the glitter,

731
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,287
and then-- it was just too much going on.

732
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:11,456
The hand and the deer in the headlights pose.

733
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:15,059
I think that she went in wanting to give us her all,

734
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:18,396
and I think it could have been a little bit more clean and executed.

735
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:21,132
Trend-wise, I think the words would be replicated,

736
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:23,735
but I don't think I would necessarily want to replicate

737
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,637
- those splotches or the dots  on the forehead. - Well, no.

738
00:33:26,737 --> 00:33:29,307
And I don't think that's the point, though.

739
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:32,310
The trend is the words, and then you create your own eye look

740
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:35,146
based on whatever your words are to tie them together.

741
00:33:35,246 --> 00:33:37,281
- True. True. - Yeah, that is a cool concept.

742
00:33:37,381 --> 00:33:40,418
This has been the most incredible experience in the entire world.

743
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:43,654
Knowing that just one of us gets to win this

744
00:33:43,754 --> 00:33:48,793
is hard to accept because I feel like we all deserve it.

745
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:54,065
But the way that this will feel complete is if I win.

746
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:56,334
I think at the end of the day, the way I look at it,

747
00:33:56,434 --> 00:34:00,171
is this is a competition, and I want to look at someone and say,

748
00:34:00,271 --> 00:34:03,808
"You have the ability and the potential to be the next James Charles."

749
00:34:03,908 --> 00:34:05,810
And when I think about people like you,

750
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:07,612
you have the total package.

751
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,814
So, you have to have it. You have to bring it.

752
00:34:09,914 --> 00:34:12,183
You have to be marketing-savvy. You have to know how to talk.

753
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:13,818
You have to know how to present yourself.

754
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:16,287
So whoever the winner is should be able to do all of that, too.

755
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:18,389
And be a talented artist while they're at it.

756
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:19,657
- Of course. - Yeah.

757
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:22,760
Well, this was definitely not easy,

758
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:25,396
but I think we have a final decision.

759
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:27,565
- We do. - Yep.

760
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:30,268
Let's bring 'em in.

761
00:34:32,836 --> 00:34:35,139
Hi, artists.

762
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,542
We've come to a decision, but I first

763
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:40,178
want to say some words to each one of you.

764
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:43,081
Kailin, when I called to tell you you made the competition,

765
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:45,850
you couldn't believe that you would ever get picked.

766
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:48,853
But in every single challenge,

767
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:50,521
you have proven that you are talented

768
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:52,390
and that you deserve to be here.

769
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:55,359
Tonight, you blossomed and sparkled,

770
00:34:55,459 --> 00:34:59,363
and I'm so glad that I finally got to see you.

771
00:34:59,463 --> 00:35:02,433
Kailin: This journey has been so unreal.

772
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:05,336
I've learned to appreciate my own artistry,

773
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:08,673
and I've learned that, like, I am a really good artist.

774
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,408
Like, why was I doubting myself?

775
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:11,609
The thing that I'm taking away from this

776
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:13,177
is nothing but gratitude,

777
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:16,247
and nothing but, like, I-- I can do that.

778
00:35:16,347 --> 00:35:17,682
Like, I am that.

779
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:20,818
I can slay the beauty community, and I'm about to.

780
00:35:20,918 --> 00:35:23,121
You will see.

781
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:25,756
Ashley, you came into this competition

782
00:35:25,856 --> 00:35:29,727
strong and polished but with a really hard shell.

783
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:33,264
Slowly, and I do mean very,

784
00:35:33,364 --> 00:35:36,767
very, very slowly,

785
00:35:36,867 --> 00:35:38,436
you've finally let your guard down,

786
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:40,738
and I'm so grateful that you let us in

787
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:43,374
and we got to see your humor and warmth.

788
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:44,575
And your mega makeup moment

789
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:47,145
that you created today was major.

790
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:50,548
Ashley: I am squeezing Kailin and Benny's hands.

791
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,350
I am, like, hoping I'm not breaking them.

792
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:54,785
But at this point, I, like, can't feel anything in my body.

793
00:35:54,885 --> 00:35:57,421
My heart is beating in my throat.

794
00:35:57,521 --> 00:36:00,758
I have never felt my eyes so hot before.

795
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:03,928
But I'm really excited to become a lot more vulnerable

796
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:05,796
on my channel and for my subscribers

797
00:36:05,896 --> 00:36:08,799
because I do believe that I have a story to tell,

798
00:36:08,899 --> 00:36:10,701
and I can't wait to relay it to all of you.

799
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:14,305
Benny, tonight you did an amazing job

800
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:15,773
showing us the two sides of yourself.

801
00:36:15,873 --> 00:36:18,476
This bunny look was cute, creative,

802
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:20,645
and a little bit cheeky as well.

803
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:23,447
Over the past few weeks, it has been great seeing you grow as an artist,

804
00:36:23,547 --> 00:36:27,685
but I have loved watching you grow so much as a person.

805
00:36:27,785 --> 00:36:29,253
Thank you so much.

806
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:33,257
Being here, I learned to be humble,

807
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:36,694
be confident, don't hide behind something,

808
00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:38,563
and be you.

809
00:36:38,663 --> 00:36:41,399
Because you're only one person

810
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:43,668
and you can only show yourself.

811
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:46,971
Honestly, this was the best experience of my whole entire life.

812
00:36:47,071 --> 00:36:51,509
Tonight's decision was definitely a hard one,

813
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:52,810
but ultimately came down

814
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,946
to consistency throughout the competition,

815
00:36:55,046 --> 00:37:00,384
and who I think has what it takes to be a beauty superstar.

816
00:37:00,484 --> 00:37:03,521
Our first ever Instant Influencer is...

817
00:37:14,298 --> 00:37:15,299
Ashley.

818
00:37:19,803 --> 00:37:23,874
- Congratulations, love. - Oh, my God.

819
00:37:23,974 --> 00:37:25,409
( squealing )

820
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:27,778
Ashley: This is a total out of body experience.

821
00:37:27,878 --> 00:37:30,848
Like, I won. I am the first Instant Influencer.

822
00:37:30,948 --> 00:37:33,618
I am so, so, so proud of you.

823
00:37:33,718 --> 00:37:35,653
Ashley: I'm so proud of myself.

824
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,655
Congratulations. You earned it.

825
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:42,460
And it has been a pleasure watching you kill it every single challenge.

826
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,930
Ashley: The one thing I learned from James during this whole experience

827
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,898
is that dreams really do come true.

828
00:37:47,998 --> 00:37:50,735
I cannot believe that this is actually happening.

829
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:52,603
It's just been this crazy journey.

830
00:37:52,703 --> 00:37:55,006
I know that this will solidify that following your dreams

831
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,674
is always the right thing to do.

832
00:37:56,774 --> 00:38:00,044
And I am so excited to see my son and tell him,

833
00:38:00,144 --> 00:38:02,813
"Son, your mom's a winner. We did it."

834
00:38:02,913 --> 00:38:05,583
Ashley, I have to steal you because we have to go sign off

835
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:06,984
- and make your winning video. - Oh, my God.

836
00:38:07,084 --> 00:38:09,053
- Whoo! - Let's go.

837
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:12,623
- Whoo! - I cannot believe this.  This is absolutely insane.

838
00:38:12,723 --> 00:38:15,593
This is going to change my whole life.

839
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:19,463
