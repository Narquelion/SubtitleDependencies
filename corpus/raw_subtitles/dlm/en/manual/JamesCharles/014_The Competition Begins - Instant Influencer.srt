00:00:02,802 --> 00:00:05,171
Hi, sisters! James Charles here,

2
00:00:05,204 --> 00:00:08,341
and today I have something extra special for you.

3
00:00:08,374 --> 00:00:12,478
As you know, last year I started the search to find the next beauty influencer.

4
00:00:12,511 --> 00:00:14,714
Literally thousands of you answered the call,

5
00:00:14,747 --> 00:00:18,317
and I was blown away by what I saw.

6
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:19,385
Wow!

7
00:00:19,418 --> 00:00:23,222
( overlapping chatter )

8
00:00:23,255 --> 00:00:26,659
But I could only pick six to bring with me

9
00:00:26,692 --> 00:00:29,662
to the YouTube stages in Los Angeles, California.

10
00:00:29,695 --> 00:00:32,165
You are officially one of the six people

11
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:35,068
- on the show. - Oh, yes!

12
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:36,569
( laughing )

13
00:00:36,602 --> 00:00:38,571
I'm sorry. I'm so hysterical right now.

14
00:00:38,604 --> 00:00:40,339
Congratulations, sister, you've made it.

15
00:00:40,372 --> 00:00:42,508
Oh, my God. Are you serious?

16
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:44,377
- ( sobbing ) - Oh, why you crying?

17
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:47,413
Oh, my God! I was not expecting this.

18
00:00:47,446 --> 00:00:50,383
Oh, my God.

19
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:54,520
Over the next month, I'll test their artistry, camera presence,

20
00:00:54,553 --> 00:00:58,691
and potential to be a beauty superstar.

21
00:00:58,724 --> 00:01:01,394
- There'll be  a few special guests... - You guys are hot, too.

22
00:01:01,427 --> 00:01:03,296
- ( all screaming ) - Oh, my God. I can't.

23
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:05,364
...and a ton of surprises.

24
00:01:05,397 --> 00:01:08,801
But in the end, only one can become

25
00:01:08,834 --> 00:01:11,671
an instant influencer.

26
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:14,307
My name is Christian Perez, I am 18 years old,

27
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,642
and I'm from Los Angeles, California.

28
00:01:16,675 --> 00:01:18,411
I moved to L.A. because after my dad got deported,

29
00:01:18,444 --> 00:01:20,379
I knew that Los Angeles was the place I needed to be

30
00:01:20,412 --> 00:01:23,182
to get further in my career as an influencer.

31
00:01:23,215 --> 00:01:25,585
Some days I'm a blue alien, another day I'm a gremlin.

32
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:27,220
Sometimes I'll draw Billie Eilish

33
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,122
or Naomi Campbell on my face.

34
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:30,690
I work on my art all the time.

35
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:33,192
All I ever do is makeup, edit, and post.

36
00:01:33,225 --> 00:01:35,428
Makeup, edit, and post. Makeup, edit, and post. Makeup, edit, and post.

37
00:01:35,461 --> 00:01:38,798
I live, breathe, and die makeup.

38
00:01:38,831 --> 00:01:41,601
Hi, I'm Gabriel Dreams, I am 21 years old,

39
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:44,537
and I currently reside in Los Angeles, California.

40
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:45,771
Growing up in foster care,

41
00:01:45,804 --> 00:01:47,640
I didn't have the best childhood,

42
00:01:47,673 --> 00:01:49,442
but through my art is me

43
00:01:49,475 --> 00:01:51,511
reconnecting with my inner child.

44
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:52,879
Coming here, I really want to inspire others

45
00:01:52,912 --> 00:01:55,715
and show that your past does not define you.

46
00:01:55,748 --> 00:01:59,585
My name is Kailin Chase, I live in Denver, Colorado, and I'm 24 years old.

47
00:01:59,618 --> 00:02:01,787
I went from being a little bit of an ugly duckling

48
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,589
who had a really hard life,

49
00:02:03,622 --> 00:02:06,726
to persevering, being extremely ambitious.

50
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:08,394
I really found my power through makeup,

51
00:02:08,427 --> 00:02:10,897
and I'm ready to inspire others to do the same.

52
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,532
Mwah! Bye, beauties.

53
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,771
Hello, you guys! And welcome to the first-ever episode

54
00:02:18,804 --> 00:02:20,907
of "Instant Influencer."

55
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,210
Oh, my gosh! I am so excited to have you guys here today!

56
00:02:24,243 --> 00:02:26,179
I need to see your beautiful faces, though.

57
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:28,314
Lights!

58
00:02:28,347 --> 00:02:31,284
- Hi, James! - Hi, guys! Oh, my God!

59
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:32,785
When I called you guys to tell you that you made the show,

60
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:36,455
we actually gave you your first Compact Challenge.

61
00:02:36,488 --> 00:02:38,424
Your first challenge actually starts...

62
00:02:38,457 --> 00:02:39,692
- right now. - Okay.

63
00:02:39,725 --> 00:02:41,327
Tell me what I have to do.

64
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,829
I need you to come on the first day of filming

65
00:02:43,862 --> 00:02:45,665
with a makeup look on

66
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:48,301
that tells us who you are as an artist.

67
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:50,469
- No pressure. - There is no  creative boundaries.

68
00:02:50,502 --> 00:02:51,938
You can come with whatever look you want,

69
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:53,673
whatever hair you want, whatever outfit you want.

70
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:55,474
I just want to be able to look at you and see,

71
00:02:55,507 --> 00:02:56,776
okay, this is Ashley Strong,

72
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:58,778
Kailin Chase, Britany Renteria,

73
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:01,647
as an artist and as a person represented.

74
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,417
I feel electric! My body is, like, shaking right now.

75
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:08,321
- All righty. Thank you! - Okay, well, I need to, like,

76
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:09,522
go figure out what the hell I'm gonna do.

77
00:03:09,555 --> 00:03:10,823
Well you better go, then.

78
00:03:10,856 --> 00:03:11,891
It was nice talking to you, sister!

79
00:03:11,924 --> 00:03:13,693
Oh, my God, thank you!

80
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:14,860
Thank you. Talk to you soon.

81
00:03:14,893 --> 00:03:16,495
- Bye! - Bye.

82
00:03:16,528 --> 00:03:18,831
You guys all look absolutely incredible,

83
00:03:18,864 --> 00:03:20,866
and I am so excited to learn more,

84
00:03:20,899 --> 00:03:23,002
so let's go ahead and take a closer look.

85
00:03:23,035 --> 00:03:25,538
Benny, we're gonna go ahead and start with you.

86
00:03:25,571 --> 00:03:27,840
Tell me about this makeup look and how it defines you as an artist.

87
00:03:27,873 --> 00:03:31,577
This is just a mixture of Japanese cherry blossoms

88
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:34,747
and a scenery with mountains on my forehead.

89
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,849
The mountains remind me of my father,

90
00:03:36,882 --> 00:03:38,818
and my mother lived in Japan.

91
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:41,520
So, I went for this exotic scene

92
00:03:41,553 --> 00:03:43,823
to represent the future that is ahead of me.

93
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:46,692
I come from such a small town where's there nothing to do

94
00:03:46,725 --> 00:03:48,761
and I felt like I would always be stuck there.

95
00:03:48,794 --> 00:03:50,863
But now that I'm here, I've realize

96
00:03:50,896 --> 00:03:53,633
that I have a chance and I am very excited.

97
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,501
And that is the right attitude to have.

98
00:03:55,534 --> 00:03:58,638
I am 18 years old and I'm from Carbondale, Pennsylvania.

99
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:00,640
Growing up, I always felt like

100
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:02,808
I really couldn't be myself most the time.

101
00:04:02,841 --> 00:04:04,910
<i> ♪♪ I wanna dance ♪♪</i>

102
00:04:04,943 --> 00:04:08,347
What made me comfortable in breaking me out of my shell

103
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,483
was finding the love of makeup

104
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:12,918
because it gave me more confidence,

105
00:04:12,951 --> 00:04:15,521
and I can't wait to blossom in this competition.

106
00:04:15,554 --> 00:04:18,391
One note that I would love to give you is that the mountain story

107
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,626
and the cherry blossom story are both beautiful.

108
00:04:20,659 --> 00:04:22,795
But they're not very cohesive together, so I would love to see

109
00:04:22,828 --> 00:04:25,765
- how you can connect  those in the future. - Thank you.

110
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:27,800
Hi, Gabriel. Tell me about your look today.

111
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:30,002
Well, this represents me as an artist

112
00:04:30,035 --> 00:04:31,904
because with this I can bring a message,

113
00:04:31,937 --> 00:04:33,406
and that's what I really like to do with my work,

114
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,708
is inspire change.

115
00:04:35,741 --> 00:04:39,612
So, I did the Earth and the skull to represent

116
00:04:39,645 --> 00:04:41,580
how we need to, like, do as much as we can

117
00:04:41,613 --> 00:04:44,417
to save the animals and the nature that we have

118
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,085
before, you know, it's too late.

119
00:04:46,118 --> 00:04:47,620
How long did this makeup look take you today?

120
00:04:47,653 --> 00:04:49,989
I woke up at 12:30.

121
00:04:50,022 --> 00:04:51,424
- And then-- - In the morning?

122
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,492
- Yeah. - Oh, my God.

123
00:04:53,525 --> 00:04:55,961
The amount of work that you put into it really does show.

124
00:04:55,994 --> 00:04:57,630
The one note that I would love to give you

125
00:04:57,663 --> 00:04:59,765
is that your story about Mother Nature is beautiful,

126
00:04:59,798 --> 00:05:01,801
but it has nothing to do with you as a person.

127
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:03,836
I wanted to see your personal journey

128
00:05:03,869 --> 00:05:05,538
and how that connects to you more as an artist.

129
00:05:06,672 --> 00:05:08,941
- Hi, Christian - Hey, James.

130
00:05:08,974 --> 00:05:12,645
I am so intrigued by what is going on with this look today.

131
00:05:13,912 --> 00:05:15,915
Oh, my God! Wow!

132
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:18,351
Tell me about this look and how it defines you as an artist.

133
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:20,920
I was homeless for quite some time in 2019

134
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:22,421
because my dad got deported.

135
00:05:22,454 --> 00:05:25,991
Um, so, kind of to symbolize my dark past,

136
00:05:26,024 --> 00:05:29,095
I wanted to put that into a mask.

137
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:32,098
And then my face is actually an orchid,

138
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:35,034
symbolizing a brighter future for me ahead.

139
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:36,736
I'm really sorry to hear about your father,

140
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:39,472
and I'm glad that you're here and you're okay.

141
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:43,476
In your audition video, you actually introduced yourself as Indigo, not Christian.

142
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,010
Indigo is a stage name for me.

143
00:05:45,043 --> 00:05:46,812
It's actually a nickname that my friends gave me

144
00:05:46,845 --> 00:05:48,981
when I used to dye my hair blue and all these crazy colors.

145
00:05:49,014 --> 00:05:50,583
And it just kind of stuck, so ever since,

146
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:51,951
that's been my online persona.

147
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:53,686
Do you want us to call you by Christian or Indigo?

148
00:05:53,719 --> 00:05:55,654
- Let's go with Indigo. - Okay, Indigo from now on.

149
00:05:55,687 --> 00:05:58,023
Well, Indigo, I love this look.

150
00:05:58,056 --> 00:05:59,658
The one note that I do wanna give, however,

151
00:05:59,691 --> 00:06:01,494
is that this look and the mask,

152
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:02,962
obviously it's covering your face

153
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:04,430
and you had to do the full reveal.

154
00:06:04,463 --> 00:06:06,632
I really want to get to know Indigo,

155
00:06:06,665 --> 00:06:08,534
for who you truly are without anything hiding

156
00:06:08,567 --> 00:06:10,836
or getting in the way.

157
00:06:10,869 --> 00:06:12,938
- Hi, Kailin! - Hey!

158
00:06:12,971 --> 00:06:14,774
Tell me about this look that defines you.

159
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:17,610
So I do a lot of everyday wearable looks

160
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:20,179
and kind of keep it a little more low-key.

161
00:06:20,212 --> 00:06:23,182
- Mm-hmm. - But I really wanted people  to know exactly who I am.

162
00:06:23,215 --> 00:06:26,452
I have, like, gone through so much in my life

163
00:06:26,485 --> 00:06:30,523
and I've just been a very, like, vivacious person through...

164
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,691
I feel like I want to also encourage people...

165
00:06:32,724 --> 00:06:34,860
Disruptive and I'm fun and I'm loud...

166
00:06:34,893 --> 00:06:36,529
No way. There's, like, no way.

167
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,431
Like, I'm not even worried about it. Like...

168
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:40,699
My biggest weakness in this entire competition

169
00:06:40,732 --> 00:06:43,135
is that I'm a rambler and I will talk for days.

170
00:06:43,168 --> 00:06:45,704
"Why do they keep emailing me? Like, there's no way."

171
00:06:45,737 --> 00:06:48,941
And then I got it, and I was just like, blown away. So I'm--

172
00:06:48,974 --> 00:06:52,044
Shut up! Like, seriously.

173
00:06:52,077 --> 00:06:55,748
With my neck, I actually took the Stila.

174
00:06:55,781 --> 00:06:57,716
I was just kind of thinking, like, of a painting,

175
00:06:57,749 --> 00:07:00,486
like the palette. Like, it's a hot mess,

176
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:02,054
- which is exactly who I am. - Beautiful chaos.

177
00:07:02,087 --> 00:07:03,756
Mm, yeah. Beautiful chaos.

178
00:07:06,158 --> 00:07:07,626
The one note that I have for you

179
00:07:07,659 --> 00:07:08,994
was that your explanation of the look

180
00:07:09,027 --> 00:07:10,996
was also a little bit of a beautiful mess.

181
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:12,731
But I really want to challenge you to kind of

182
00:07:12,764 --> 00:07:14,567
think about what you want to say before you say it.

183
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,502
It'll really help you out when it comes to public speaking

184
00:07:16,535 --> 00:07:19,138
and also filming YouTube videos.

185
00:07:19,171 --> 00:07:20,639
- Hi, Ashley! - Hi, James.

186
00:07:20,672 --> 00:07:22,908
This makeup look is so abstract.

187
00:07:22,941 --> 00:07:26,078
- I am really pumped  to learn more about this. - This is inkblot-inspired.

188
00:07:26,111 --> 00:07:28,214
My message has to do with mental health.

189
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:30,583
I became a mom when I was 16

190
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,518
and that came with a ton of challenges.

191
00:07:32,551 --> 00:07:34,220
I've strived to keep a healthy balance,

192
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:37,189
but it's something that I've struggled with over the years.

193
00:07:37,222 --> 00:07:39,792
Artistry just helps me slow down and really center myself.

194
00:07:39,825 --> 00:07:41,760
I wanted to create a look

195
00:07:41,793 --> 00:07:43,095
that was interpreted by the viewer

196
00:07:43,128 --> 00:07:44,497
because you never really know

197
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,699
what's going on beneath the surface.

198
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:48,767
No one person sees the same image with an inkblot,

199
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,202
so I think that that's a really important part of art

200
00:07:50,235 --> 00:07:52,238
and just life in general.

201
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:54,106
I love that that's a part of your message,

202
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:55,975
and hopefully a lot of people will connect with that as well.

203
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:58,677
My drive is super strong coming into this competition.

204
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,579
Not only am I looking out for me,

205
00:08:00,612 --> 00:08:01,580
but I'm looking out for my son.

206
00:08:01,613 --> 00:08:03,115
What's on your eyebrow?

207
00:08:03,148 --> 00:08:06,018
Being a mom, you'll do, like, anything for your kid.

208
00:08:08,253 --> 00:08:09,855
Why you slide in like that?

209
00:08:09,888 --> 00:08:12,024
I'm ready to compete and I'm ready to win this.

210
00:08:14,092 --> 00:08:16,228
James: I've tried to do watercolor looks many times before.

211
00:08:16,261 --> 00:08:18,864
They are very challenging to actually look accurate,

212
00:08:18,897 --> 00:08:20,699
and this was very impressive to me.

213
00:08:20,732 --> 00:08:21,967
The one note that I have for you

214
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,068
is that because of the look,

215
00:08:23,101 --> 00:08:24,303
you're missing the brows

216
00:08:24,336 --> 00:08:26,038
and kind of the eyes and the lips.

217
00:08:26,071 --> 00:08:27,806
I would've loved to see it with a lash,

218
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:29,708
so not all those elements were missing.

219
00:08:29,741 --> 00:08:31,977
- Thanks. - Britany!

220
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:35,080
- Hi! - Tell me about this makeup look  that you have on today.

221
00:08:35,113 --> 00:08:38,784
So it represents my personality, which is bubbly.

222
00:08:38,817 --> 00:08:40,286
And, um, with the eyes, I just wanted to play with color

223
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:42,588
because that's what usually what I like to do.

224
00:08:42,621 --> 00:08:45,291
I'm one of those people that's mainly eyes and the nude lip.

225
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:47,993
A lot of times people would say, "Oh, my God, you're so outgoing

226
00:08:48,026 --> 00:08:50,663
and stuff on YouTube, but you're shy in person."

227
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:53,799
So I was that one girl that everybody would whisper about,

228
00:08:53,832 --> 00:08:55,601
saying, "Oh, she wears too much makeup.

229
00:08:55,634 --> 00:08:57,069
She looks like a clown."

230
00:08:57,102 --> 00:08:59,004
For some reason, that just made me

231
00:08:59,037 --> 00:09:00,839
pile on more makeup.

232
00:09:00,872 --> 00:09:03,709
It's been hard. I moved out when I was 15,

233
00:09:03,742 --> 00:09:07,680
so I literally have two full-time jobs

234
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,848
and I'm just trying to make it.

235
00:09:09,881 --> 00:09:12,017
One note that I would love to give is that this look,

236
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:14,186
in comparison to the others is a little bit more simplistic.

237
00:09:14,219 --> 00:09:16,822
I would love to see how creative you can truly be.

238
00:09:16,855 --> 00:09:21,060
I think James thinks I'm basic. I'm not basic.

239
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:23,295
Thank goodness this was not an elimination challenge.

240
00:09:23,328 --> 00:09:25,898
I still have a chance to bring it.

241
00:09:25,931 --> 00:09:29,201
I'm honestly very, very impressed with each and every single one of your looks.

242
00:09:29,234 --> 00:09:32,137
A lot of you guys rose to the level that I was hoping for.

243
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,940
But one person in particular blew me away with both technical skill

244
00:09:34,973 --> 00:09:39,245
and used imaginative artistry by connecting it to their personal journey.

245
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:44,717
Ashley, congratulations, you are the winner

246
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,919
- of the first  Compact Challenge. - Oh, my God!

247
00:09:46,952 --> 00:09:49,855
- I'm so excited. Thank you. - Thank you!

248
00:09:49,888 --> 00:09:53,759
My look won. I made the right call. Yes!

249
00:09:53,792 --> 00:09:56,061
And this means you're going to get a major advantage

250
00:09:56,094 --> 00:09:57,896
in today's elimination challenge.

251
00:09:57,929 --> 00:09:59,832
- Yes! - Before we get into that,  though,

252
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:01,266
do you guys want to know what you're competing for?

253
00:10:01,299 --> 00:10:03,936
- Yes. - Okay.

254
00:10:03,969 --> 00:10:06,105
The winner of "Instant Influencer" will take home

255
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:08,641
a full lighting and videography equipment package

256
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:11,810
just like the one I have at home, valued at $10,000.

257
00:10:11,843 --> 00:10:15,080
- Wow. - So your guys' videos will be  looking as bomb as heck.

258
00:10:15,113 --> 00:10:18,350
You will also win a collaboration with me on my YouTube channel.

259
00:10:18,383 --> 00:10:20,152
Both: Hi, sisters.

260
00:10:20,185 --> 00:10:22,354
James Charles here, and welcome back to my YouTube channel.

261
00:10:22,387 --> 00:10:25,791
A new challenge that we're doing here called "Makeup Relay."

262
00:10:25,824 --> 00:10:28,093
Whoa!

263
00:10:28,126 --> 00:10:29,928
Thank you so much for all the--

264
00:10:29,961 --> 00:10:31,864
- ( laughing ) - And finally,

265
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:32,999
no big deal or anything, but also...

266
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,202
$50,000.

267
00:10:37,235 --> 00:10:40,305
- Oh, my God. - Oh, my God.

268
00:10:40,338 --> 00:10:43,342
Of course, it all sounds fun, but it will only come from very hard work,

269
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:46,979
and I'm very excited to tell you guys about today's first elimination challenge.

270
00:10:47,012 --> 00:10:49,882
As you guys know, there are many aspects of what it takes

271
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:53,185
to be a successful beauty influencer, and this show is going to test all of them.

272
00:10:53,218 --> 00:10:56,789
Marketing is a vital skill to have when it comes to being an influencer,

273
00:10:56,822 --> 00:11:01,460
and in today's challenge, we're going to be testing your ability to sell products.

274
00:11:01,493 --> 00:11:03,062
I had the opportunity to collaborate with Morphe

275
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:05,197
on my James Charles X Morphe palette.

276
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:08,100
It is still one of the best-selling palettes of all time.

277
00:11:08,133 --> 00:11:11,303
In order to get that there, though, we had to do a full marketing campaign behind it.

278
00:11:11,336 --> 00:11:13,205
And I don't know if you guys saw my reveal video,

279
00:11:13,238 --> 00:11:15,107
but I did ten different makeup looks,

280
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,309
all in different rainbow colors for the 39 shades

281
00:11:17,342 --> 00:11:19,311
and finalized it with the white splash paint look

282
00:11:19,344 --> 00:11:21,880
which is now on all of the packaging.

283
00:11:21,913 --> 00:11:26,385
In today's challenge, you guys are going to be making your very own reveal video.

284
00:11:26,418 --> 00:11:29,354
I've never done a product reveal before, but I sell things all the time.

285
00:11:29,387 --> 00:11:32,191
<i> So I think I got this in the bag.</i>

286
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:34,326
At the beginning of this challenge, you guys are gonna get to step foot

287
00:11:34,359 --> 00:11:37,096
for the first time in the Ulta Beauty Closet,

288
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:41,266
for all your makeup needs and necessities, where you will select one item

289
00:11:41,299 --> 00:11:43,168
to create your marketing campaign around.

290
00:11:43,201 --> 00:11:45,871
You need to plan, film, and edit

291
00:11:45,904 --> 00:11:48,273
your very on short commercial around your makeup product.

292
00:11:48,306 --> 00:11:51,744
I wanna see your personality and your ability to sell products,

293
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:53,011
because at the end of this challenge,

294
00:11:53,044 --> 00:11:56,515
one of you will be going home.

295
00:11:56,548 --> 00:11:58,851
For this challenge, you guys are gonna have three hours

296
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,919
to put together your commercials.

297
00:12:00,952 --> 00:12:05,858
I am terrified that I have to get this video done in three hours.

298
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:09,027
It takes me three hours to film a single video,

299
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:12,364
so I don't know how this is going to work.

300
00:12:12,397 --> 00:12:14,099
Not to add any more pressure or anything,

301
00:12:14,132 --> 00:12:15,934
but I feel like I should probably tell you guys

302
00:12:15,967 --> 00:12:18,103
about the judges that'll be joining me on the final panel.

303
00:12:18,136 --> 00:12:20,305
My permanent judge that will be with us the entire series

304
00:12:20,338 --> 00:12:22,307
is a legend in the beauty community.

305
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,176
She is the president and creative director

306
00:12:24,209 --> 00:12:26,044
of Anastasia Beverly Hills.

307
00:12:26,077 --> 00:12:30,482
- Norvina will be here today. - Benny:<i> I love Norvina.</i>

308
00:12:30,515 --> 00:12:32,417
And I love Anastasia Beverly Hills.

309
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:34,953
James: And also, our second celebrity guest judge

310
00:12:34,986 --> 00:12:37,222
is somebody that can only be described as iconic.

311
00:12:37,255 --> 00:12:40,959
She's also very hot. It's Paris Hilton.

312
00:12:40,992 --> 00:12:43,128
- Oh, my gosh! - I can't.

313
00:12:43,161 --> 00:12:48,233
Paris Hilton is here? I can't breathe.

314
00:12:48,266 --> 00:12:50,068
So you guys need to make sure Norvina and Paris

315
00:12:50,101 --> 00:12:52,070
also want to buy your product, too.

316
00:12:52,103 --> 00:12:54,139
Ashley, as the winner of today's Compact Challenge,

317
00:12:54,172 --> 00:12:56,275
you get to make your first selection in the Ulta Beauty closet.

318
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:58,177
Bye, guys.

319
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,879
Oh, my God.

320
00:13:00,912 --> 00:13:02,481
Ashley:<i> I see the Ulta Beauty closet</i>

321
00:13:02,514 --> 00:13:05,017
<i> and the first thing I wanna do is just go grab a bag</i>

322
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,151
and start shoving stuff in there.

323
00:13:06,184 --> 00:13:08,153
<i> I'm just, like, so excited</i>

324
00:13:08,186 --> 00:13:10,055
<i> that I can't believe there's so much stuff.</i>

325
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:15,828
All right, Ashley, what did you pick as your item for your commercial?

326
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:19,565
I got the ColourPop volumizing mascara in "Blue Ya Mind."

327
00:13:19,598 --> 00:13:22,835
Okay. This should be super, super interesting.

328
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:24,436
All right, for everybody else, you guys are going to get

329
00:13:24,469 --> 00:13:26,338
the same opportunity to run to the closet.

330
00:13:26,371 --> 00:13:29,374
And remember to blend, but don't blend in.

331
00:13:29,407 --> 00:13:33,145
Your time starts now!

332
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:38,350
James: Oh, my God.

333
00:13:38,383 --> 00:13:40,553
That is some sister sprinting if I ever did see it.

334
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,956
- Victory. - Yeah, yeah!

335
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:47,459
- Okay. - Okay, you guys, I want to  know what everybody got.

336
00:13:47,492 --> 00:13:49,595
So we know Ashley has the blue mascara.

337
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:52,531
Christian, Anastasia Beverly Hills foundation.

338
00:13:52,564 --> 00:13:56,635
Benny, the KKW contouring stick. Gabriel. Oh, ho, ho!

339
00:13:56,668 --> 00:13:59,271
You better be careful with that one. I'm expecting greatness.

340
00:13:59,304 --> 00:14:00,873
- I will try. - Britany...

341
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:03,175
- Okay, the Ofra highlighter. - Yeah.

342
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:05,110
All right, and finally, Kailin.

343
00:14:05,143 --> 00:14:07,279
- The Real Techniques  beauty sponge. - Yes!

344
00:14:07,312 --> 00:14:08,447
- Good luck, you guys. - Cool.

345
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:14,186
Oh, my gosh, so much glitter.

346
00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:22,628
Okay.

347
00:14:25,363 --> 00:14:28,600
Ashley:<i> These video labs are fabulous, first of all.</i>

348
00:14:28,633 --> 00:14:31,370
<i> I'm pumped at how professional the setup is.</i>

349
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:33,438
Oh, my God, you can see other people?

350
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,073
What the ( bleep )?

351
00:14:35,106 --> 00:14:36,508
Blue mascara is kind of self-explanatory,

352
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:39,578
but it's a really fun, pop-y product.

353
00:14:39,611 --> 00:14:42,180
<i> I've never done a product reveal video before.</i>

354
00:14:42,213 --> 00:14:44,316
<i> This is something new and really challenging.</i>

355
00:14:44,349 --> 00:14:46,551
But I feel like I'm going to be able to create

356
00:14:46,584 --> 00:14:48,353
a great campaign around this

357
00:14:48,386 --> 00:14:49,588
<i> because the product is really simple.</i>

358
00:14:49,621 --> 00:14:51,356
I came out with a brand-new mascara

359
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:52,591
and I'm so excited to show--

360
00:14:52,624 --> 00:14:54,326
Oh, I should talk into the camera.

361
00:14:54,359 --> 00:14:56,194
<i> Since this challenge isn't artistry-based</i>

362
00:14:56,227 --> 00:14:58,263
<i> and I can't show my creativity that way,</i>

363
00:14:58,296 --> 00:15:01,233
my goal is to wow the judges with what I do know about editing,

364
00:15:01,266 --> 00:15:05,304
<i> which is like a little bit of a B-roll, lazy Susan moment,</i>

365
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:06,538
<i> and a really convincing demeanor.</i>

366
00:15:06,571 --> 00:15:08,407
Oh.

367
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:13,545
Benny:<i> Three hours seems like a lot of time,</i>

368
00:15:13,578 --> 00:15:16,048
<i> but once you start working and rushing,</i>

369
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:20,052
- it is no time at all. - My skin looks cute.

370
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:23,655
<i> I'm revealing the KKW contour and highlight stick.</i>

371
00:15:23,688 --> 00:15:26,692
I'm just going to just show you guys how to contour,

372
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:30,228
get snatched, and get a man after this.

373
00:15:30,261 --> 00:15:33,732
<i> I do feel like I'm really good at contour, but not cream.</i>

374
00:15:33,765 --> 00:15:36,034
Okay, sis? Okay.

375
00:15:36,067 --> 00:15:37,302
<i> I'm focusing on the cheeks</i>

376
00:15:37,335 --> 00:15:39,237
<i> because it gives a lot of definition.</i>

377
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:42,708
My plan is to make a very lighthearted, funny,

378
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:44,676
<i> but also informative video.</i>

379
00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:46,578
It's perfect, and it's so creamy,

380
00:15:46,611 --> 00:15:49,548
and it gives you that glowy look.

381
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:52,184
Now this foundation is relatively full coverage.

382
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:55,487
Indigo:<i> I grabbed the Anastasia Beverly Hills luminous foundation</i>

383
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:59,057
<i> because my skin is stained a pink from the first challenge. </i>

384
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:01,426
Not only is it getting rid of the redness that I had in my skin,

385
00:16:01,459 --> 00:16:04,029
but it's also getting rid of my dark circles.

386
00:16:04,062 --> 00:16:06,732
This product is working just the way that I wanted it to.

387
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:10,268
<i> I've never actually used it, but it is full coverage</i>

388
00:16:10,301 --> 00:16:13,071
-<i> and it is working perfectly. </i> - This is genuinely, actually

389
00:16:13,104 --> 00:16:15,073
looking better than my regular foundation.

390
00:16:15,106 --> 00:16:16,675
So thank the Lord for that.

391
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:19,611
Hey, guys! So today I'm going to be filming a video

392
00:16:19,644 --> 00:16:21,213
all about my favorite highlight,

393
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:24,016
which is from Ofra in the color Pillow Talk.

394
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:27,285
Wait. I need to take a breath.

395
00:16:27,318 --> 00:16:31,423
<i> I know it's key to not just show off this Ofra highlighter, but to show off myself. </i>

396
00:16:31,456 --> 00:16:33,458
Lucky for me, once I turn that camera on,

397
00:16:33,491 --> 00:16:35,727
my bubbly side just comes out naturally.

398
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,129
Before you apply the highlight,

399
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,764
you have to have a flawless base,

400
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:42,100
so I'm gonna go ahead and do that off-camera real quick.

401
00:16:42,133 --> 00:16:44,369
<i> I decided to do my intro without makeup,</i>

402
00:16:44,402 --> 00:16:46,438
<i> which I'm not used to because usually I do that first.</i>

403
00:16:46,471 --> 00:16:49,341
<i> But I want to do most of my makeup off-camera. </i>

404
00:16:49,374 --> 00:16:52,044
Oh, this blush is gonna be perfect!

405
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:55,147
Look how gorgeous that is. Wow.

406
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,149
I know this is a risk using James' Morphe palette,

407
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,084
but I think this risk is gonna pay off.

408
00:16:59,117 --> 00:17:01,453
- You'll be fine. -<i> I came up with the idea</i>

409
00:17:01,486 --> 00:17:03,355
<i> to showcase that you can do a lot with neutral colors</i>

410
00:17:03,388 --> 00:17:05,424
and a lot with bright colors.

411
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:07,659
It's really hard for bright colors to be pigmented,

412
00:17:07,692 --> 00:17:11,196
and that's not the case with the James Charles palette, girl.

413
00:17:11,229 --> 00:17:14,699
This morning, James didn't really feel like he got to know me through my look.

414
00:17:14,732 --> 00:17:17,202
This should be good. This should be--

415
00:17:17,235 --> 00:17:20,706
So now, I'm revealing this colorful product to show off my colorful personality.

416
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:27,212
- Whew. Okay. - You guys, today we are  doing a look

417
00:17:27,245 --> 00:17:30,248
with literally one single--

418
00:17:30,281 --> 00:17:32,250
Wait, ( bleep ).

419
00:17:32,283 --> 00:17:34,586
Forgot my words. Whoops.

420
00:17:34,619 --> 00:17:37,389
<i> I like to take my time when I'm filming my videos. </i>

421
00:17:37,422 --> 00:17:41,827
And I like to take takes like you wouldn't believe. I take so many takes.

422
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,528
Boys and girls, welcome.

423
00:17:43,561 --> 00:17:46,531
So, today we are going to get in how--

424
00:17:46,564 --> 00:17:48,400
The hell did I just say?

425
00:17:48,433 --> 00:17:50,202
Boys and girls, hello, wel--

426
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,537
Oh, okay, I should have that out of my hand. Okay.

427
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:55,340
Boys and girls, welcome. Hello! So, today--

428
00:17:55,373 --> 00:17:57,642
Okay, that sounded hella fake. Okay.

429
00:17:57,675 --> 00:18:00,345
In the previous challenge, James noted that I was rambling,

430
00:18:00,378 --> 00:18:02,848
<i> which he was 1,000% right on because that is a weakness</i>

431
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:05,550
<i> that I have had for my entire life. </i>

432
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:08,753
When doing my foundation, I like to quickly press--

433
00:18:08,786 --> 00:18:10,856
When doing my foundation--

434
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:13,158
When doing my foundation, I like to quickly press--

435
00:18:13,191 --> 00:18:16,328
And so in this challenge, I'm really going to focus on

436
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:20,198
being concise, clear, and prepared for my words.

437
00:18:20,231 --> 00:18:23,869
My skin literally looks so fresh, and so supple and juicy right now.

438
00:18:23,902 --> 00:18:26,571
Like, so plump. Who needs-- Oh, wait, wait, wait. Okay.

439
00:18:26,604 --> 00:18:29,475
I can do this. I can do this. Okay?

440
00:18:31,943 --> 00:18:33,879
 Britany:<i> I'm the first one out of the room to go edit</i>

441
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:35,680
<i> and I'm super excited.</i>

442
00:18:35,713 --> 00:18:37,716
<i> This is exactly what I wanted to prove to James,</i>

443
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:41,386
that I could work my butt off and be the first one to finish.

444
00:18:41,419 --> 00:18:43,455
Okay.

445
00:18:43,488 --> 00:18:44,656
Let's go edit.

446
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:51,429
James: All right, you guys, I wanted to come in and tell you

447
00:18:51,462 --> 00:18:54,900
you have about one hour and 30 minutes remaining for this challenge.

448
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:56,701
I'm super excited to see the final products.

449
00:18:56,734 --> 00:18:58,837
Get back to cutting super quick.

450
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:02,741
There's a lot of footage, Gabriel. What were you thinking?

451
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:04,442
<i> I think I'm pretty strong at editing.</i>

452
00:19:04,475 --> 00:19:06,478
<i> The trickiest part was whether or not </i>

453
00:19:06,511 --> 00:19:08,446
to put all clips that I wanted to do.

454
00:19:08,479 --> 00:19:10,282
You-- you gotta make it work.

455
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,584
<i> At this point, I start to get nervous,</i>

456
00:19:12,617 --> 00:19:16,254
<i> but I know that I have to finish no matter what. </i>

457
00:19:16,287 --> 00:19:19,691
Britany:<i> I did most of my makeup off-camera,</i>

458
00:19:19,724 --> 00:19:21,960
<i> so I only have a small amount of clips</i>

459
00:19:21,993 --> 00:19:23,628
<i> because editing is not my forte. </i>

460
00:19:23,661 --> 00:19:26,331
I can't really go and polish it the way I want

461
00:19:26,364 --> 00:19:28,366
<i> because I'm scared if I keep working on it I'm going to make it worse. </i>

462
00:19:28,399 --> 00:19:30,903
I'm done.

463
00:19:39,677 --> 00:19:41,479
Kailin:<i> I was really hoping that I would have, like,</i>

464
00:19:41,512 --> 00:19:42,881
<i> an hour and a half to edit.</i>

465
00:19:42,914 --> 00:19:44,950
But at this point, I have no idea

466
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:47,819
how I'm going to narrow this down.

467
00:19:47,852 --> 00:19:52,224
<i> I'm so nervous right now, and I'm scrambling for my life.</i>

468
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,769
<i> I am just cutting, cutting, cutting, cutting, cutting,</i>

469
00:20:04,802 --> 00:20:06,404
and cutting my life away.

470
00:20:06,437 --> 00:20:10,275
James: Five, four, three, two, one.

471
00:20:10,308 --> 00:20:12,711
We're done!

472
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:14,613
Cut, period.

473
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:16,848
<i> Time is up, and I did not</i>

474
00:20:16,881 --> 00:20:18,950
<i> watch my video all the way through.</i>

475
00:20:18,983 --> 00:20:20,385
I don't know what to say.

476
00:20:20,418 --> 00:20:21,820
We're going into this deliberation

477
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:24,823
and I have no idea what this video looks like.

478
00:20:32,063 --> 00:20:35,300
All right my artists, how was your first official elimination challenge?

479
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:37,035
- Intense. - Yeah.

480
00:20:37,068 --> 00:20:38,637
Well, we are so excited to see

481
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,805
what you guys have put together for us today.

482
00:20:40,838 --> 00:20:45,443
But before that, I wanna quickly introduce you guys to our guest judges.

483
00:20:45,476 --> 00:20:48,413
Joining us the entire season is one of my close friends,

484
00:20:48,446 --> 00:20:52,884
makeup legend, she's the president and creative director of Anastasia Beverly Hills.

485
00:20:52,917 --> 00:20:54,419
Please welcome Norvina.

486
00:20:54,452 --> 00:20:55,920
- ( cheering ) - Hi, guys.

487
00:20:55,953 --> 00:20:58,556
So excited to see what you have to offer.

488
00:20:58,589 --> 00:21:01,393
Our second judge needs no introduction, let's be honest.

489
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:04,696
She's iconic, legendary, and totally hot.

490
00:21:04,729 --> 00:21:07,532
Paris Hilton.

491
00:21:07,565 --> 00:21:10,068
- You guys are hot, too. - ( laughter )

492
00:21:10,101 --> 00:21:12,871
Let's go ahead and watch some videos.

493
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:14,406
Benny, you're gonna be up first.

494
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,775
The rest of you guys can all go take a seat.

495
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:19,511
It's important to do well in this first elimination challenge,

496
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:21,880
<i> because otherwise you're going home.</i>

497
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:24,316
And I do not want to be the first one to go home.

498
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:27,019
All right, Benny, let's go ahead and take a look at your commercial.

499
00:21:29,854 --> 00:21:30,989
( coughs, gags )

500
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,559
Hey, guys, it's Benny Sera.

501
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,027
Sis, come join the fam.

502
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:38,596
Okay, for today's video

503
00:21:38,629 --> 00:21:42,600
I'm going to be reviewing the KKW Beauty,

504
00:21:42,633 --> 00:21:44,869
um, Creme Contour Sticks.

505
00:21:44,902 --> 00:21:47,772
So once I have the product on my back of my hand,

506
00:21:47,805 --> 00:21:51,343
I'm going to take a stippling brush, something like this,

507
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:52,777
and I'm gonna kinda pinch it.

508
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:54,346
And I'm going to go in with the brush

509
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:55,814
and I'm just gonna take it and kind of

510
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:58,850
get my contour on, you know, sis?

511
00:21:58,883 --> 00:22:01,786
Hi, everyone. Okay, so I just did the rest

512
00:22:01,819 --> 00:22:04,522
of my makeup off-camera and now I'm back.

513
00:22:04,555 --> 00:22:06,591
The Creme Contour Sticks look amazing.

514
00:22:06,624 --> 00:22:08,460
All I did was really just set them

515
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,829
at loose translucent powder, 'cause this does the trick.

516
00:22:13,698 --> 00:22:16,735
All right, Benny, thank you so much for sharing your video with us.

517
00:22:16,768 --> 00:22:18,903
I would love to give you some positive notes.

518
00:22:18,936 --> 00:22:21,873
I really, really like how your personality came through in this video.

519
00:22:21,906 --> 00:22:25,944
And that is really, really important when it comes to being an influencer.

520
00:22:25,977 --> 00:22:27,645
But I would've loved to get the opportunity

521
00:22:27,678 --> 00:22:29,481
to actually watch you apply that product,

522
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,516
blend it out a little bit more, and kind of all over the face

523
00:22:31,549 --> 00:22:32,817
rather than just on the cheekbones

524
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:33,818
'cause we contour kind of everywhere.

525
00:22:33,851 --> 00:22:35,120
Yes, I understand.

526
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:36,755
- Norvina? - Hi, Benny.

527
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:38,990
- Hi. - I actually have the pleasure

528
00:22:39,023 --> 00:22:42,394
of creating product reveal videos all the time

529
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:45,497
for Anastasia Beverly Hills, and one of the things

530
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,599
that I would have loved to have seen from you

531
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:51,169
is you explaining what the product is, first and foremost.

532
00:22:51,202 --> 00:22:53,738
What is contour? How does this differ?

533
00:22:53,771 --> 00:22:55,607
The different ways that you can contour.

534
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,475
You can do it with cream, you can do it with powder.

535
00:22:57,508 --> 00:22:59,544
When you are actually revealing a product,

536
00:22:59,577 --> 00:23:01,146
you have to kind of explain it to the viewer

537
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:03,748
as if they have no idea about the product,

538
00:23:03,781 --> 00:23:05,049
about the category, for the first time.

539
00:23:05,082 --> 00:23:07,118
That's a really good point. Paris?

540
00:23:07,151 --> 00:23:08,887
I loved your personality in the video,

541
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,555
and I love that you say "sis"

542
00:23:10,588 --> 00:23:12,957
because sis over here always says it,

543
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:14,692
and I just-- I love that.

544
00:23:14,725 --> 00:23:16,161
So I feel that really just--

545
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:17,862
you know, when the viewers are watching,

546
00:23:17,895 --> 00:23:19,864
it makes them feel like they're part of your family.

547
00:23:19,897 --> 00:23:21,566
That's what I want. That's what I want to do.

548
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:24,035
I want to, um, make everyone happy and entertained

549
00:23:24,068 --> 00:23:26,805
because I was put down most of my life,

550
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:28,807
saying that I would never get anywhere.

551
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,042
A lot of people really don't believe in me.

552
00:23:31,075 --> 00:23:33,011
- Well, look where  you are today. - Exactly.

553
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:35,146
Here in Hollywood shooting with all of us

554
00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:37,182
and I think you're a star.

555
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:39,050
Thank you so much. That means a lot.

556
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:40,819
Thank you, Benny, for sharing your commercial with us.

557
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:42,720
- Thank you. - You can go ahead  and sit down.

558
00:23:42,753 --> 00:23:45,123
All right, our next artist is going to be Britany.

559
00:23:45,156 --> 00:23:48,159
Hey, guys. So, today I'm filming a very exciting video.

560
00:23:48,192 --> 00:23:49,894
I'm gonna be telling you guys all about

561
00:23:49,927 --> 00:23:51,796
my favorite highlight from Ofra.

562
00:23:51,829 --> 00:23:54,199
Okay, so, now that I got my base on,

563
00:23:54,232 --> 00:23:55,934
we're nice and flawless.

564
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:57,902
But let me just show you guys this color right here.

565
00:23:57,935 --> 00:24:00,572
It's so beautiful. It has a pink undertone to it.

566
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,474
Look at that.

567
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:04,108
So, let me go ahead and show you this baby in action.

568
00:24:04,141 --> 00:24:06,744
So, I'm just gonna use my M510 from Morphe.

569
00:24:06,777 --> 00:24:08,613
You could use any highlighting brush.

570
00:24:08,646 --> 00:24:11,516
And look at how beautiful this is.

571
00:24:11,549 --> 00:24:15,119
Some of those drugstore highlighters can look a little powdery sometimes.

572
00:24:15,152 --> 00:24:18,756
Don't get me wrong. There is some good drugstore highlighters as well,

573
00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:20,892
but this one is worth spending your coin on.

574
00:24:20,925 --> 00:24:25,029
I hope that you guys enjoyed seeing how I get my favorite glow,

575
00:24:25,062 --> 00:24:27,999
and I'll talk to you guys in my next video. Bye!

576
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,936
Okay, well, one thing that I would've loved to see

577
00:24:31,969 --> 00:24:34,239
was a slightly raised camera angle.

578
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:37,242
You actually cut off the top of your head for some of the clips,

579
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:40,745
and I would've just loved to have it a little bit more focused on your face.

580
00:24:40,778 --> 00:24:43,548
That's really, really important in order to, like, connect.

581
00:24:43,581 --> 00:24:45,183
I noticed when we were watching the work rooms,

582
00:24:45,216 --> 00:24:47,118
<i>you actually were the first one to leave and go edit,</i>

583
00:24:47,151 --> 00:24:48,887
<i> and the first one done editing, right?</i>

584
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,022
I just kept thinking of all the stuff I could've done,

585
00:24:51,055 --> 00:24:53,157
and I wish I had, like, spent more time on it.

586
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:56,060
It is important to take those extra minutes, even if you're rushing,

587
00:24:56,093 --> 00:24:58,062
in order to make sure that everything is perfect and ready to go

588
00:24:58,095 --> 00:24:59,931
because slow and steady wins the race.

589
00:24:59,964 --> 00:25:02,967
I was hoping that James would see me finishing in two hours

590
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,236
with one hour to spare as a good thing.

591
00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:07,272
- Norvina? - Hi, Britany.

592
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:09,073
Hi, I love your eye shadow. I just had to tell you.

593
00:25:09,106 --> 00:25:10,808
- It's beautiful. - Thank you. Thank you so much.

594
00:25:10,841 --> 00:25:13,011
I loved your highlight. It looked beautiful.

595
00:25:13,044 --> 00:25:14,646
-<i> Thank you. </i> -<i> It was blinding, that's for sure.</i>

596
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,614
I think you looked gorgeous.

597
00:25:16,647 --> 00:25:19,217
One of the things that I would like for you to improve on

598
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:21,686
is to think about coming off more

599
00:25:21,719 --> 00:25:24,556
of reviewing the product and speaking about the product

600
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:26,291
and revealing the product attributes.

601
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:28,860
As I was watching you, I was trying to figure out

602
00:25:28,893 --> 00:25:31,162
why you were mentioning so many other things,

603
00:25:31,195 --> 00:25:33,932
like the Morphe brush and drugstore highlighters.

604
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:37,268
All that was doing was sending my thoughts into other directions,

605
00:25:37,301 --> 00:25:40,071
and you want to keep me focused on what you're selling.

606
00:25:40,104 --> 00:25:43,141
- Paris? - First off, I want to say  I love your hair color.

607
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:46,010
- Thank you so much. - I think for an influencer,  it's definitely important

608
00:25:46,043 --> 00:25:49,847
to have kind of your trademark, and I think that color works so well on you,

609
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,950
and I thought that you had a lot of fun with it.

610
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:54,185
- I thought that you killed it. - Thank you so much.

611
00:25:54,218 --> 00:25:57,255
It means a lot. I love my fellow artists, but I'm low-key hoping

612
00:25:57,288 --> 00:25:58,923
that someone did worse than me.

613
00:25:58,956 --> 00:26:01,693
All right, our next artist is going to be Kailin.

614
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:04,329
Kailin:<i> This is about to be very interesting.</i>

615
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:07,065
- Let's all say a prayer. - Boys and girls, welcome,

616
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:09,067
because today we are going to be getting into

617
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,870
how to do your full face with one tool and one tool only,

618
00:26:12,903 --> 00:26:14,339
the Real Techniques Beauty Sponge.

619
00:26:14,372 --> 00:26:16,207
I'm telling you guys, this thing is phenomenal.

620
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,942
When I start my foundation with this sponge,

621
00:26:17,975 --> 00:26:20,111
I like to focus on the perimeter of my face.

622
00:26:20,144 --> 00:26:22,647
Oh, my gosh. You guys, if that isn't a snatched base,

623
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,881
I don't know what is.

624
00:26:23,914 --> 00:26:25,383
It's time to get into the contour,

625
00:26:25,416 --> 00:26:26,884
and I like to put the contour color

626
00:26:26,917 --> 00:26:28,886
directly onto the sponge

627
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:30,888
so that I don't have a harder time diffusing it.

628
00:26:30,921 --> 00:26:33,758
See, you guys? Cream contour is not so scary.

629
00:26:33,791 --> 00:26:35,259
And when you're using a beauty sponge,

630
00:26:35,292 --> 00:26:37,962
you really have that control to diffuse it out.

631
00:26:37,995 --> 00:26:40,665
Foundation, cream contour, powder, highlighter, eye shadow.

632
00:26:40,698 --> 00:26:42,634
Literally everything was done

633
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:44,736
with this Real Techniques Beauty Sponge.

634
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:48,106
- It's everything. - Oh!

635
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:52,310
Oh, my God. Thank you.

636
00:26:52,343 --> 00:26:54,145
- Are you okay? We good? - Yeah, yeah. Oh, my--

637
00:26:54,178 --> 00:26:57,915
I was just not expecting it to come out.

638
00:26:57,948 --> 00:27:00,084
Before I even get into this, I've noticed this is a common theme with you.

639
00:27:00,117 --> 00:27:02,253
You are not very confident.

640
00:27:04,955 --> 00:27:07,825
Which is a problem...

641
00:27:07,858 --> 00:27:09,727
because you should be.

642
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,229
Okay? I'm telling you this now.

643
00:27:11,262 --> 00:27:13,264
I was really excited to talk to you the first time

644
00:27:13,297 --> 00:27:15,099
because we loved your audition video

645
00:27:15,132 --> 00:27:16,834
and I remember you were crying on the call

646
00:27:16,867 --> 00:27:18,236
and you didn't think you were gonna make it.

647
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:21,372
Which I get, but now you're here, okay?

648
00:27:21,405 --> 00:27:25,143
You killed it this morning and you killed it again, so let's get it together.

649
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:27,211
I really like this video, Kailin.

650
00:27:27,244 --> 00:27:28,713
I think this was really, really good.

651
00:27:28,746 --> 00:27:30,114
It made me want to get the product.

652
00:27:30,147 --> 00:27:31,949
I love how you came in with a full concept of

653
00:27:31,982 --> 00:27:34,952
"I'm gonna do everything using this sponge."

654
00:27:34,985 --> 00:27:37,255
- Paris? - I loved the video.

655
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:39,791
I actually don't know how to do contour,

656
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:42,393
but I felt after watching the video, I learned.

657
00:27:42,426 --> 00:27:44,162
You made me want to buy this product,

658
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:46,964
and I think that's what being an influencer is about.

659
00:27:46,997 --> 00:27:48,199
Thank you.

660
00:27:48,232 --> 00:27:50,034
- Norvina? - Hi.

661
00:27:50,067 --> 00:27:52,937
- I think you did  such a beautiful job. - Thank you.

662
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:55,773
I think you're definitely an artist, and that comes through.

663
00:27:55,806 --> 00:27:57,809
I think that you like to lead with education,

664
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:59,877
which for me is very important.

665
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,145
One of the things that I would've liked for you to speak to

666
00:28:01,178 --> 00:28:03,748
is why this Real Techniques sponge?

667
00:28:03,781 --> 00:28:06,217
There's hundreds of sponges out there.

668
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:09,120
How is this one making your application

669
00:28:09,153 --> 00:28:10,455
easier, better than a previous one?

670
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:12,957
That would've been good, I think.

671
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:14,959
But I really liked the artistry. That was great.

672
00:28:14,992 --> 00:28:16,427
Thank you.

673
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,329
All right, next up we have Gabriel.

674
00:28:18,362 --> 00:28:20,998
Hey, dreamers. Welcome back to my channel,

675
00:28:21,031 --> 00:28:22,934
and today is something very special.

676
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:25,002
Are you guys ready for the reveal?

677
00:28:25,035 --> 00:28:27,238
( squeals )

678
00:28:27,271 --> 00:28:29,874
The colors I'm gonna use in my palette today

679
00:28:29,907 --> 00:28:32,076
are this beautiful orange-y brown.

680
00:28:32,109 --> 00:28:34,412
Just applying that to my inner corner.

681
00:28:34,445 --> 00:28:37,248
This little guy right here. He's a little dark brown.

682
00:28:37,281 --> 00:28:39,484
And put that slightly under the color that I just put.

683
00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:42,220
Taking the brightest color of the blue in my palette,

684
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:46,090
I'm gonna go ahead and ever so slightly pack that onto the outer corner.

685
00:28:46,123 --> 00:28:48,860
As you can see, I already went ahead and cut that crease again.

686
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:51,863
I'm gonna go in with my brightest pink shade.

687
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:56,367
I'm gonna go ahead and really pack that on there.

688
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,270
So, that is the finished look. I hope you all enjoyed this.

689
00:28:59,303 --> 00:29:03,007
And I'll see you next time on Gabriel Dreams.

690
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,275
James: All right, Gabriel.

691
00:29:04,308 --> 00:29:05,777
Well, the pressure was definitely on

692
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:07,078
because you went with my very own palette.

693
00:29:07,111 --> 00:29:09,147
Um, one thing that I would've loved to see

694
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,516
because it is a palette reveal-- some swatches.

695
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:14,318
At the end of the day, swatches don't always show how they perform on the eye.

696
00:29:14,351 --> 00:29:15,520
We know this best, and I love how you did

697
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:17,355
focus a little bit more on the tutorial.

698
00:29:17,388 --> 00:29:21,025
But for a palette reveal video, it's kind of customary.

699
00:29:21,058 --> 00:29:23,528
Oh, my God. I did film the swatches,

700
00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:26,164
I just-- it slipped my mind to put it in the video.

701
00:29:26,197 --> 00:29:28,166
- Norvina? - Hi, Gabriel.

702
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:31,302
- Hi. - I thought it was unique  what you did, overall.

703
00:29:31,335 --> 00:29:34,839
- Thank you. - I think that you have  a lot of potential

704
00:29:34,872 --> 00:29:38,075
to become all-around, polished, amazing influencer.

705
00:29:38,108 --> 00:29:40,344
I think you need a little bit of work with the details.

706
00:29:40,377 --> 00:29:42,246
You know, learning to really sell the product,

707
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:43,915
explain the product,

708
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,550
to really talk about the different pulses,

709
00:29:45,583 --> 00:29:48,085
how some of them can be used as contour, blush, et cetera.

710
00:29:48,118 --> 00:29:50,254
I think that would've been fantastic.

711
00:29:50,287 --> 00:29:54,225
- Paris? - So, I love that you call  everyone dreamers.

712
00:29:54,258 --> 00:29:58,563
I think it's important to have kind of a nickname for your fan base.

713
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:01,065
All my fans call themselves my Little Hiltons.

714
00:30:01,098 --> 00:30:04,836
And, yeah, I'm a dreamer, baby.

715
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:06,370
Oh, thank you.

716
00:30:06,403 --> 00:30:08,472
All right, next up, we have Ashley.

717
00:30:08,505 --> 00:30:10,107
Hey, guys, it's your girl Strashme.

718
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,943
I am bursting with excitement

719
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,878
because I get to announce to you

720
00:30:13,911 --> 00:30:16,113
I'm coming out with my very own mascara!

721
00:30:16,146 --> 00:30:19,250
But the gag is it's blue!

722
00:30:19,283 --> 00:30:21,452
I wanted to create a product that was going to allow you

723
00:30:21,485 --> 00:30:23,221
to incorporate color into your everyday routine

724
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:26,290
in a safe and "volumptuous" way.

725
00:30:26,323 --> 00:30:29,460
Not only do I like to apply the mascara to my regular lashes--

726
00:30:29,493 --> 00:30:31,128
as you can see on the bottom here,

727
00:30:31,161 --> 00:30:33,464
I have the blue featured.

728
00:30:33,497 --> 00:30:35,867
But I also like to apply it to my false lashes,

729
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,469
just to give a little bit more of, like, an amped up vibe.

730
00:30:38,502 --> 00:30:40,304
It's called Blue Ya Mind.

731
00:30:40,337 --> 00:30:42,540
Get your hands on my brand-new mascara right now,

732
00:30:42,573 --> 00:30:45,343
and add a pop of color to your makeup routine.

733
00:30:47,077 --> 00:30:49,046
Okay, well, Ashley, you had the first pick

734
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:51,082
in the Ulta Beauty Closet today.

735
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:53,117
So I want to know, why did you choose the blue mascara?

736
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:54,886
I thought it would be easy to sell because mascara

737
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:57,188
is such a popular product.

738
00:30:57,221 --> 00:31:00,124
So I feel like I could've skipped over a lot of explaining

739
00:31:00,157 --> 00:31:02,894
how to use it and just jump right into a commercial.

740
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:05,997
Well, I loved your video. It was short, to the point.

741
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,165
I loved the insertion of the B-Roll, the posing clips,

742
00:31:08,198 --> 00:31:11,002
and the little rotating moment of the product.

743
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:13,070
It was really, really good and definitely showcased

744
00:31:13,103 --> 00:31:14,372
knowledge of what a reveal video can

745
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:16,908
and probably should look like.

746
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:19,010
My one note for you overall would be in the beginning of the video,

747
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:21,345
you started off by saying, "I am bursting with excitement."

748
00:31:21,378 --> 00:31:24,548
And your face was very, like, "I am bursting with excitement."

749
00:31:24,581 --> 00:31:28,052
I was like, it's okay to break down that shell a little bit.

750
00:31:28,085 --> 00:31:29,353
If you're gonna say you're bursting with excitement,

751
00:31:29,386 --> 00:31:31,022
like, we need to see excitement.

752
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:32,056
So you need to make sure that the followers

753
00:31:32,089 --> 00:31:34,358
believe what you're saying.

754
00:31:34,391 --> 00:31:36,594
- Norvina? - Really great job.

755
00:31:36,627 --> 00:31:40,031
I felt that it felt very professional, very polished.

756
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:43,601
I think that it was definitely an underdog product that you chose.

757
00:31:43,634 --> 00:31:45,436
Blue mascara is out there,

758
00:31:45,469 --> 00:31:48,306
so I think that the insertion of those clips was amazing.

759
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:50,374
There's 2,000 mascaras out there

760
00:31:50,407 --> 00:31:52,176
and when people are shopping for them,

761
00:31:52,209 --> 00:31:54,211
the first thing they want to know is it volumizing,

762
00:31:54,244 --> 00:31:56,547
is it lengthening, does it build?

763
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,549
That would've been really great to know.

764
00:31:58,582 --> 00:32:01,085
- James: Paris? - I love your jacket.

765
00:32:01,118 --> 00:32:02,687
I need to wear it to Burning Man this year.

766
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,556
- You can borrow it. - It's just really hot.

767
00:32:05,589 --> 00:32:07,692
And I love how confident you were,

768
00:32:07,725 --> 00:32:10,695
and I just thought it was, like, very sexy vibes.

769
00:32:10,728 --> 00:32:12,697
I've never worn blue mascara before,

770
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:15,099
but now I'm gonna try it out.

771
00:32:15,132 --> 00:32:16,667
Thank you.

772
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:19,337
All right, last but finally not least, Indigo.

773
00:32:21,438 --> 00:32:24,475
Hey, guys, it's your last brain cell here.

774
00:32:24,508 --> 00:32:27,578
So my name is Indigo, and today I am going to be showing you

775
00:32:27,611 --> 00:32:31,682
the Anastasia Beverly Hills Luminous Foundation.

776
00:32:31,715 --> 00:32:34,251
<i> ( music plays )</i>

777
00:32:34,284 --> 00:32:36,153
I'm not wearing anything at all underneath.

778
00:32:36,186 --> 00:32:37,722
I just want to show you how good this foundation

779
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:40,091
is on its own because it is that good.

780
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:42,326
So, I'm going to be using just one pump on my face,

781
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:45,062
and just spread that evenly.

782
00:32:45,095 --> 00:32:48,733
Now, as you can see, this foundation is honestly so full coverage

783
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:51,469
that you honestly don't even need concealer.

784
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:53,337
It got rid of my under eye,

785
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:55,606
which-- I didn't sleep at all last night,

786
00:32:55,639 --> 00:32:57,742
so that is really saying something.

787
00:32:57,775 --> 00:33:01,112
Look at that. Before, I looked like I was dying,

788
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:04,015
and now I am, but I don't look it.

789
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:07,084
All right, you guys can also use my code "HashtagPeriod"

790
00:33:07,117 --> 00:33:10,021
for full price and full shipping and handling.

791
00:33:10,054 --> 00:33:15,493
I'm going to go and enjoy my full coverage dewy day.

792
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:17,028
Okay, well, first and foremost, Indigo,

793
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:19,463
that was very, very enjoyable to watch.

794
00:33:19,496 --> 00:33:21,766
You were one of the only people today that actually used,

795
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:24,468
like, the typical, like, YouTube-style humor.

796
00:33:24,501 --> 00:33:26,370
This morning, we obviously talked about wanting to make sure

797
00:33:26,403 --> 00:33:27,671
that you were coming through

798
00:33:27,704 --> 00:33:29,473
because your makeup looked beautiful,

799
00:33:29,506 --> 00:33:31,308
but we have that full mask, and I want to commend you

800
00:33:31,341 --> 00:33:32,576
because I definitely think

801
00:33:32,609 --> 00:33:36,147
the sarcastic, dry, but good humor

802
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,381
was very apparent in this video.

803
00:33:37,414 --> 00:33:39,483
So great job on that. Norvina?

804
00:33:39,516 --> 00:33:41,218
- Hi. - Hi.

805
00:33:41,251 --> 00:33:44,155
It was very nice watching you review the foundation.

806
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,157
Whenever people want to talk about a foundation

807
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,492
and they have skin concerns, they always want to know

808
00:33:48,525 --> 00:33:50,494
- is it non-comedogenic? - Yeah.

809
00:33:50,527 --> 00:33:51,796
Is it oil-free? Is it gluten-free?

810
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:53,497
Things of that nature. Talc-free.

811
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:55,533
And those are all written on the box on purpose.

812
00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:57,701
I know for a fact because I put 'em there.

813
00:33:57,734 --> 00:33:59,570
So it would've been really great for you

814
00:33:59,603 --> 00:34:00,571
to address those in the beginning.

815
00:34:00,604 --> 00:34:01,806
Thank you.

816
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:03,340
If this was your sponsored video,

817
00:34:03,373 --> 00:34:05,109
would you send him the check for this?

818
00:34:05,142 --> 00:34:07,078
Norvina: I think he did a really, really good job.

819
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:09,513
I might have had some edits, but other than that,

820
00:34:09,546 --> 00:34:11,482
yes, I think it has amazing potential.

821
00:34:11,515 --> 00:34:14,585
- Great. - I'll take it.

822
00:34:14,618 --> 00:34:16,720
That is the most validating thing of this entire show,

823
00:34:16,753 --> 00:34:19,156
this entire series. I love you so much.

824
00:34:19,189 --> 00:34:22,793
- Paris? - I love how you described  the foundation.

825
00:34:22,826 --> 00:34:26,197
I love that makeup brand, obviously.

826
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:29,200
I really love how you used the special effects and graphics

827
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,202
I think that's really important in editing,

828
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:33,704
- just to get  the message across. - Thank you.

829
00:34:33,737 --> 00:34:36,207
All right, artists, well, thank you guys so much for your hard work today.

830
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,708
I know this was quite the challenge.

831
00:34:37,741 --> 00:34:39,543
There is more to come, but you guys very much

832
00:34:39,576 --> 00:34:41,812
impressed all of us with your videos.

833
00:34:41,845 --> 00:34:43,714
We have quite a lot to discuss,

834
00:34:43,747 --> 00:34:45,216
so if you guys will give us a minute,

835
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,250
we'll call you back in a little.

836
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,690
- Kailin: Oh, my God. - I'm taking this chair.

837
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:56,227
Okay, you guys, I have a lot of thoughts,

838
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,261
but I really want to hear from you guys

839
00:34:57,294 --> 00:34:59,163
what you think first.

840
00:34:59,196 --> 00:35:00,664
Some stepped up to the challenge,

841
00:35:00,697 --> 00:35:03,601
and some maybe missed the challenge a little bit.

842
00:35:03,634 --> 00:35:05,202
Yeah. Paris, how did you feel?

843
00:35:05,235 --> 00:35:07,338
I feel like everyone did a really great job.

844
00:35:07,371 --> 00:35:09,673
And I actually-- I have my favorite,

845
00:35:09,706 --> 00:35:11,842
just 'cause I think he's so cute.

846
00:35:11,875 --> 00:35:14,145
There's just something special about Benny.

847
00:35:14,178 --> 00:35:16,881
I just, like, felt for him. Like, when he was talking,

848
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:18,582
it almost made me want to cry, but I didn't want to cry

849
00:35:18,615 --> 00:35:21,218
because I didn't want my eyelashes to fall off.

850
00:35:21,251 --> 00:35:23,320
Norvina, who was your top of this week?

851
00:35:23,353 --> 00:35:27,591
My top of the week is Ashley. She was very polished.

852
00:35:27,624 --> 00:35:29,693
She showed the product up close.

853
00:35:29,726 --> 00:35:31,862
She did the little spin. She did application.

854
00:35:31,895 --> 00:35:34,498
Ah! Okay, I want to fight both of you right now

855
00:35:34,531 --> 00:35:37,268
because Benny was in my least favorite of the group

856
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:38,736
if I had to split it in half.

857
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:40,771
And I think Ashley's video was very professional...

858
00:35:40,804 --> 00:35:42,940
- I agree. - ...but the personality  wasn't there.

859
00:35:42,973 --> 00:35:45,276
- Yes. - She claimed that she  was excited and bursting,

860
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:48,445
- but I was like,  "Girl, you're fine." - Paris: I love her as well,

861
00:35:48,478 --> 00:35:50,281
but I feel like that's just her attitude.

862
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:53,450
She's not the type that's gonna be, like, overly excited

863
00:35:53,483 --> 00:35:54,952
and be like, "I'm bursting with excitement!"

864
00:35:54,985 --> 00:35:56,620
I just feel like that's just not--

865
00:35:56,653 --> 00:35:58,289
People do love that,

866
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,790
but don't say you're excited if you're not,

867
00:35:59,823 --> 00:36:01,292
be cause the audience has to believe it, you know?

868
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:03,427
- I really liked Kailin. - Okay.

869
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,429
James: I think her video was so good,

870
00:36:05,462 --> 00:36:06,931
and she did a really good job of coming up

871
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:08,432
with a full concept for the product.

872
00:36:08,465 --> 00:36:10,267
She talked about how you can use it.

873
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,569
She did a good job of demonstrating,

874
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:14,305
and I felt like I was intrigued to buy it

875
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:15,839
- after watching her video. - Yeah.

876
00:36:15,872 --> 00:36:17,641
I feel like, out of everything,

877
00:36:17,674 --> 00:36:20,211
- the sponge was what  I wanted to buy. - Yeah.

878
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:21,946
And that's obviously very important

879
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:23,847
- when you're an influencer. - I would go more with Christian

880
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,482
as far as, like, personality.

881
00:36:25,515 --> 00:36:27,718
He appeared very friendly, but still professional,

882
00:36:27,751 --> 00:36:29,320
which is a very hard thing to do.

883
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,322
I really liked Christian's video a lot.

884
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:33,324
I think he really got a good sense of humor in there,

885
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:36,760
which showcased himself while also demonstrating the product.

886
00:36:36,793 --> 00:36:40,564
Let's go ahead and talk about the videos that were a little bit less successful.

887
00:36:40,597 --> 00:36:44,969
In terms of Britany, her video just didn't stick out that much to me.

888
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:46,971
She also finished with a ton of time to spare,

889
00:36:47,004 --> 00:36:50,341
but the video was a little bit of a mess,

890
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:53,344
in terms of, like, organization, the transitions and stuff.

891
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:55,512
It felt a little bit scripted, if that makes sense.

892
00:36:55,545 --> 00:36:58,649
James: Yeah. Well, let's talk about Gabriel.

893
00:36:58,682 --> 00:37:01,986
- He had my palette. - I love this palette.

894
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:04,521
I need it. So you have to send me this.

895
00:37:04,554 --> 00:37:05,990
- You don't have it already? - No, I don't.

896
00:37:06,023 --> 00:37:08,759
- Wow. - So, I have a couple houses,

897
00:37:08,792 --> 00:37:10,794
so maybe it got sent to one of them.

898
00:37:10,827 --> 00:37:12,429
- Must be nice. - Norvina: Yes.

899
00:37:12,462 --> 00:37:14,565
Paris: I like when people start fresh-faced...

900
00:37:14,598 --> 00:37:17,401
and then you see the final product, instead of going back and forth.

901
00:37:17,434 --> 00:37:19,603
So with the editing, I thought it was a little bit confusing.

902
00:37:19,636 --> 00:37:21,305
I agree. 100%.

903
00:37:21,338 --> 00:37:24,642
I think choosing my palette was a major, major risk,

904
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:26,677
and I don't think it paid off for him.

905
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:27,945
At the end of the day, though, these six are,

906
00:37:27,978 --> 00:37:29,713
like, the best of the best.

907
00:37:29,746 --> 00:37:32,049
<i> But we do want to give this title to somebody</i>

908
00:37:32,082 --> 00:37:33,884
<i> who truly has what it takes,</i>

909
00:37:33,917 --> 00:37:36,587
<i> so we got to knock one person out each time.</i>

910
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:39,723
All right, you guys, well, I appreciate you both so much.

911
00:37:39,756 --> 00:37:41,725
Paris, thank you so much for being here today.

912
00:37:41,758 --> 00:37:43,327
Love you the absolute most.

913
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,862
- You're so hot. - You are.

914
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:47,798
Norvina, I love you and I will see you next week.

915
00:37:47,831 --> 00:37:49,400
( knock on door )

916
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,435
All right, guys. Judges' decisions are in.

917
00:37:51,468 --> 00:37:52,936
Let's head back to our video labs

918
00:37:52,969 --> 00:37:54,571
to find out who will be continuing in the competition

919
00:37:54,604 --> 00:37:56,507
and who is going home.

920
00:38:10,787 --> 00:38:12,923
( line ringing )

921
00:38:12,956 --> 00:38:14,925
- Hi, Kailin. - Hey, James.

922
00:38:14,958 --> 00:38:16,927
You know, this morning on set

923
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,930
you talked about how your look was a bit of a beautiful mess,

924
00:38:19,963 --> 00:38:22,700
but your final video was anything but.

925
00:38:22,733 --> 00:38:24,668
I am so proud of you for letting your personality shine,

926
00:38:24,701 --> 00:38:27,371
and pulling everything together.

927
00:38:27,404 --> 00:38:28,939
Literally, by the time we finished watching the video,

928
00:38:28,972 --> 00:38:31,742
I wanted to go out and buy that sponge right away.

929
00:38:31,775 --> 00:38:33,377
You did the best in today's challenge.

930
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:35,579
Congratulations, Kailin. You are the winner.

931
00:38:35,612 --> 00:38:37,014
Thank you so much, James.

932
00:38:37,047 --> 00:38:39,450
I appreciate everything,

933
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:41,418
and I'm going to take all your critiques.

934
00:38:41,451 --> 00:38:42,586
I truly, truly appreciate it.

935
00:38:42,619 --> 00:38:44,088
- Thank you. - Of course, love.

936
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:46,791
I am so excited to see what more you have to offer.

937
00:38:51,828 --> 00:38:53,030
Me, myself, and I.

938
00:38:53,063 --> 00:38:55,733
I made it! Aah!

939
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:57,668
- James: Hi, Indigo. - Hi.

940
00:38:57,701 --> 00:39:00,971
Your reveal video was absolutely phenomenal.

941
00:39:01,004 --> 00:39:02,673
We love how you blended together your sense of humor

942
00:39:02,706 --> 00:39:04,108
along with your foundation.

943
00:39:04,141 --> 00:39:08,112
Congratulations, you're still in the competition.

944
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:10,414
Thank you.

945
00:39:16,953 --> 00:39:18,589
( sighs )

946
00:39:18,622 --> 00:39:21,392
- Made it. - We made it!

947
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:25,129
- I'm so proud of you 'cause I really-- - I'm so proud of you.

948
00:39:25,162 --> 00:39:27,498
- You really had me  scared there. - I know.

949
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:29,900
- Hi, Ashley. - Hi, James.

950
00:39:29,933 --> 00:39:32,469
Ashley, we were very, very impressed by your reveal video today.

951
00:39:32,502 --> 00:39:35,606
- You are safe. - Wow. Thank you.

952
00:39:39,176 --> 00:39:42,479
- ( whispering ) - Yass!

953
00:39:42,512 --> 00:39:44,615
- How do you feel? - I'm so relieved.

954
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:46,817
- Yeah. - Yeah. I'm happy  you guys are here.

955
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:48,886
- James: Hi, Benny. - Hi.

956
00:39:48,919 --> 00:39:51,522
Your contour and your editing in today's video

957
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:53,957
were both a little bit harsh.

958
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:55,826
But we loved how you showcased your personality

959
00:39:55,859 --> 00:39:57,694
and I want to see more.

960
00:39:57,727 --> 00:39:59,130
You're safe.

961
00:40:04,234 --> 00:40:07,405
- Benny! - Oh, my goodness.

962
00:40:16,613 --> 00:40:19,716
 Britany:<i> If I go home today, I would feel like a failure.</i>

963
00:40:19,749 --> 00:40:23,153
I'm just hoping that James really sees my potential.

964
00:40:23,186 --> 00:40:25,155
Gabriel:<i> I really just don't want to go home.</i>

965
00:40:25,188 --> 00:40:27,658
( knock on door )

966
00:40:31,728 --> 00:40:32,763
Hi, Brit.

967
00:40:39,169 --> 00:40:42,239
- Hello! - Yay.

968
00:40:42,272 --> 00:40:45,976
Now we know. Hi, Gabriel. Give us a hug.

969
00:40:46,009 --> 00:40:48,045
- Welcome. - It was a wakeup call.

970
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:50,814
- Yeah, for sure. - I don't care who  you think you are.

971
00:40:50,847 --> 00:40:52,583
- This is crazy. - I feel like...

972
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:55,619
- Yes! - Wait, does this mean  Britany's gone?

973
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:59,022
What else would it mean?

974
00:40:59,055 --> 00:41:01,225
Unfortunately, today after the judges' deliberation,

975
00:41:01,258 --> 00:41:04,094
your video was not our favorite of the day,

976
00:41:04,127 --> 00:41:06,230
and you have been eliminated.

977
00:41:08,798 --> 00:41:09,933
Can I come sit next to you?

978
00:41:09,966 --> 00:41:11,835
I love you and your personality

979
00:41:11,868 --> 00:41:15,205
and the confidence that being on camera gives you.

980
00:41:15,238 --> 00:41:16,640
( sighs )

981
00:41:18,675 --> 00:41:20,244
- I'm so proud of you. - Thank you.

982
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:21,612
And I want you to keep all the positives in mind

983
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:22,980
because this isn't a negative.

984
00:41:23,013 --> 00:41:25,282
The whole point of this is not for drama,

985
00:41:25,315 --> 00:41:26,950
no stupid eliminations,

986
00:41:26,983 --> 00:41:28,986
it's to give you guys information and resources

987
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:32,055
to be better at what you do, and you're already incredible.

988
00:41:32,088 --> 00:41:33,624
That's the reason why you're here,

989
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:34,892
and I don't want you to forget that, okay?

990
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:35,893
You have to promise me.

991
00:41:35,926 --> 00:41:38,228
- Promise? - Yeah.

992
00:41:38,261 --> 00:41:40,797
Bitch, you better promise. You're so insanely talented and you're so beautiful,

993
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:42,966
and your personality is infectious.

994
00:41:42,999 --> 00:41:46,270
I love how bubbly you are, and I'm sure everybody at home will as well.

995
00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:48,572
- And I want you  to remember that, okay? - Thank you.

996
00:41:48,605 --> 00:41:50,307
Before we go, I want to take this opportunity

997
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,309
to sign off together on the show,

998
00:41:52,342 --> 00:41:54,545
- just like this was  a regular YouTube video. - Okay.

999
00:41:54,578 --> 00:41:57,581
Hi, you guys. James here with Britany, and we are signing off

1000
00:41:57,614 --> 00:41:59,983

1003
00:42:05,188 --> 00:42:07,157
- Thank you. - Just like I did,  I'm sure everybody at home

1004
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:08,825
is gonna fall in love with you.
