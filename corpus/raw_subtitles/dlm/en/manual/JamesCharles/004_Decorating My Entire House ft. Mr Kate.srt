00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:00,963
- [All] Hi Sisters!

2
00:00:00,963 --> 00:00:02,430
- James Charles here,

3
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:03,740
and welcome back to my YouTube channel.

4
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:06,020
You guys, for today's video I am so beyond excited,

5
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:07,582
because this is a collab that I've wanted to do

6
00:00:07,582 --> 00:00:09,300
for a very very long time.

7
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,133
Today we are joined

8
00:00:10,133 --> 00:00:11,900
with Mr. Kate! - Oh my God!

9
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,730
We're having Sister Kate and Daddy Joey over here, and

10
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,546
you guys-- - (gasps) Daddy Joey!

11
00:00:16,546 --> 00:00:17,820
- Yes, definitely Daddy Joey. - Oh my God!

12
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:18,780
- I'll take it. - Okay, good.

13
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:19,613
We are together today,

14
00:00:19,613 --> 00:00:21,650
because we are doing a collab

15
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:23,170
that is not makeup related for once,

16
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:24,430
it is house related. - (laughs) Yes.

17
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:26,150
- Because all you sisters know,

18
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:27,200
I recently bought a house

19
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,350
a few months prior, - Mm-hmm.

20
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:29,183
and I moved in.

21
00:00:29,183 --> 00:00:30,520
I've been here for quite a while now,

22
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,790
and by the time this video's going up,

23
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:33,790
it is, I believe January. - Yes.

24
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:34,760
- Maybe. - Yes.

25
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,680
- That means I've been in the house

26
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,257
for about four months, now. - Mm-hmm.

27
00:00:37,257 --> 00:00:38,470
- And that means that you guys still

28
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:39,850
have not gotten a house tour.

29
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:40,683
(laughs)

30
00:00:40,683 --> 00:00:42,857
- He's been busy, okay! - I've been a little bit busy.

31
00:00:42,857 --> 00:00:45,795
- Palette, merch, traveling the world (laughs).

32
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:46,840
- A little bit, yes.

33
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,790
As soon as I bought this house,

34
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:48,884
Kate was like we need to do something

35
00:00:48,884 --> 00:00:49,810
and I was like oh, absolutely

36
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:51,330
because I've been subscribed to Kate and Joey

37
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:53,230
for literally years now. - So sweet.

38
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:54,670
- For the longest time ever.

39
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:56,470
I stan you guys, I think you guys have one

40
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:57,390
of seriously (laughs)

41
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,510
the coolest channels on YouTube.

42
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:01,450
I've been there since like before even, like 300,000.

43
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:02,575
Like, the longest time. - Wow, oh my God.

44
00:01:02,575 --> 00:01:03,990
- Swear to God, the longest time.

45
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:05,240
Like I said, as soon as we moved in,

46
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,760
Kate hit me up and was like we wanna do a makeover,

47
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,060
and I was like please,

48
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,053
I need help. - (laughs) Yeah.

49
00:01:09,053 --> 00:01:11,200
- But, I wanted to do something for my channel, too,

50
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,040
because like I said,

51
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:12,873
this collab I've wanted to do

52
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:14,010
for a very very long time now. - I know!

53
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,650
And he's so passionate about interior design,

54
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:17,997
which is so cool.

55
00:01:17,997 --> 00:01:18,830
- Yes. (laughing)

56
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,320
So, for today's video we are doing something

57
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,280
that Kate and Joey have

58
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,497
never done before, actually. - Never.

59
00:01:23,497 --> 00:01:25,830
- And I am so beyond excited, because

60
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:26,770
we are obviously going to do the

61
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,600
full-room transformation over on Kate's channel.

62
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,730
We'll talk about that in a little bit while

63
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:30,778
we're going through the house, - Yep.

64
00:01:30,778 --> 00:01:31,611
- And you guys can see that

65
00:01:31,611 --> 00:01:32,444
video over there. - Yep, yep.

66
00:01:32,444 --> 00:01:33,790
- Go subscribe, please.

67
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:35,531
But over here, because of the fact

68
00:01:35,531 --> 00:01:37,760
that so many of the rooms are

69
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,463
in the process, not done but also not the worst,

70
00:01:41,463 --> 00:01:42,429
we figured it'd be--

71
00:01:42,429 --> 00:01:43,555
- Started! - Yes.

72
00:01:43,555 --> 00:01:44,516
Sister started.

73
00:01:44,516 --> 00:01:45,349
- Sister--

74
00:01:45,349 --> 00:01:46,182
(laughing)

75
00:01:46,182 --> 00:01:47,370
We figured obviously we want to let Kate shine

76
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,203
and do her makeover,

77
00:01:48,203 --> 00:01:49,890
but for my channel we want to do a more

78
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,280
collaborative type thing. - Mm-hmm.

79
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,470
- And work together to finish

80
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:56,400
a lot of the rooms that I've started

81
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,470
and kinda show you guys what the process looks like

82
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,090
of actually taking a room

83
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:00,946
and doing it from start to finish.

84
00:02:00,946 --> 00:02:03,355
So, this might be a little bit of a longer video,

85
00:02:03,355 --> 00:02:04,983
but I'm so excited to just take you guys through it.

86
00:02:04,983 --> 00:02:09,800
There's gonna be a full production, HGTV is shaking.

87
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,320
Mr. Kate and James Charles are coming for you guys.

88
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,153
So without further ado,

89
00:02:13,153 --> 00:02:14,170
let's walk through the house,

90
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:15,520
show you guys what we have going on,

91
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,540
show you what we wanna do,

92
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,492
and let's decorate together.

93
00:02:18,492 --> 00:02:19,325
(Katie shrieks)

94
00:02:19,325 --> 00:02:21,742
(calm music)

95
00:02:26,769 --> 00:02:27,602
Alright sisters!

96
00:02:27,602 --> 00:02:28,435
So we're here at the front door

97
00:02:28,435 --> 00:02:29,268
and we thought we'd do a little bit

98
00:02:29,268 --> 00:02:30,510
of a walk-through through the house

99
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:31,810
to show you guys what is done,

100
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:33,800
what isn't done and what we really need to work on

101
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,679
for this little house makeover.

102
00:02:35,679 --> 00:02:37,560
I'm gonna be really honest with you guys,

103
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,720
we already filmed this entire thing a month ago

104
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,970
and the footage is nowhere to be found

105
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,210
but would it be a James Charles video

106
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,620
without a technical difficulty?

107
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,350
No, so we're going to redo it today.

108
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,150
- Redo it, we've already rehearsed.

109
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,508
It's going to be way faster.

110
00:02:52,508 --> 00:02:54,467
- [Joey] Kate's a month more pregnant.

111
00:02:54,467 --> 00:02:56,740
- I'm a yup, bigger belly.

112
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,230
Thank you, disclosure.

113
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:00,120
- I know we've had over a month to think about space

114
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,057
and order some stuff as well. - Yeah.

115
00:03:01,057 --> 00:03:03,860
- We though we'd walk you through it, again,

116
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,840
but this time kind of talk about our thought process

117
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,680
as to why we chose each thing

118
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,860
and what the room is going to be--

119
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:09,970
- The plan. - as apposed

120
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,620
to our initial first reactions.

121
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,130
- Yeah. - So this is like a review

122
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,096
instead of our first impression.

123
00:03:14,096 --> 00:03:14,929
- It'll be better.

124
00:03:14,929 --> 00:03:15,762
- So without further ado,

125
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:16,778
let's walk through the house.

126
00:03:16,778 --> 00:03:17,730
- Let's do it. - Again.

127
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,890
- Again (laughing).

128
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:22,095
- So room number one is my PR package room.

129
00:03:22,095 --> 00:03:24,595
(laughing)

130
00:03:24,595 --> 00:03:25,583
- This is like the big,

131
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:28,188
like it's really your entrance room in a way.

132
00:03:28,188 --> 00:03:30,060
- It is, and this is the most office we've ever had.

133
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,153
We did the list already, spoiler alert.

134
00:03:31,153 --> 00:03:32,280
We've already ordered

135
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,170
a majority of things for this house makeover.

136
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,741
- And they've arrived. - And they've arrived.

137
00:03:35,741 --> 00:03:36,770
- [Both] Clearly!

138
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:39,400
- So actually, we'll be able to execute this.

139
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,750
- Yeah, but for right now,

140
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,250
we're keeping all the boxes in this room

141
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,617
because this particular entrance foyer,

142
00:03:44,617 --> 00:03:46,378
living room space. - Formal living room

143
00:03:46,378 --> 00:03:47,992
- Is not going to be in my video

144
00:03:47,992 --> 00:03:49,826
because-- (Kate gasps)

145
00:03:49,826 --> 00:03:50,765
- We're going to be doing it

146
00:03:50,765 --> 00:03:52,467
for an OMG We're Coming Over episode

147
00:03:52,467 --> 00:03:53,825
on our channel. (James shrieks)

148
00:03:53,825 --> 00:03:54,829
- All of the boxes are being stored in here

149
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:56,190
for every the other makeover

150
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,808
so let's move on the the next room.

151
00:03:57,808 --> 00:03:59,956
The dining room

152
00:03:59,956 --> 00:04:01,843
is probably most unused room in the entire house.

153
00:04:01,843 --> 00:04:02,676
- Really?

154
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:03,984
- Well yeah, I don't really eat--

155
00:04:03,984 --> 00:04:05,330
- Yeah you don't eat-- - Here.

156
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:06,750
- Oh right, you don't eat or ever dine

157
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,583
but people sit here sometimes. - No, but does anybody--

158
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:09,750
- And work sometimes. - True.

159
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,010
Does anyone really eat in their dining room though?

160
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:13,843
- Depends.

161
00:04:13,843 --> 00:04:14,900
If you have another eating room,

162
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,203
which you do, - Which I do in the kitchen.

163
00:04:16,203 --> 00:04:18,150
- Yeah, we're gonna style them

164
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:20,790
so that this doesn't become an area

165
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,240
where crap gets collected.

166
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,490
Like it is right now.

167
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,552
- Drag me. - Oh my God (laughing).

168
00:04:25,552 --> 00:04:27,940
- I want this to feel like a fall family room.

169
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,857
So let's talk about what we need in this room.

170
00:04:29,857 --> 00:04:31,650
First of all-- - Lighting.

171
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,167
- This light is literally the ugliest thing I've ever seen

172
00:04:33,167 --> 00:04:34,480
in the entire world.

173
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,160
I want it gone immediately.

174
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,555
- Yeah, it's like very spider, spideress.

175
00:04:38,555 --> 00:04:39,403
- It's gross. - Yeah.

176
00:04:39,403 --> 00:04:41,371
- And I feel like they use like sconces

177
00:04:41,371 --> 00:04:43,008
also really tacky. - Sconces

178
00:04:43,008 --> 00:04:44,957
Right, which you specifically didn't like

179
00:04:44,957 --> 00:04:47,502
that kind of plasticy look to the shade.

180
00:04:47,502 --> 00:04:48,335
- And it looks like the cups

181
00:04:48,335 --> 00:04:50,360
if you got to your grandma's house when you we're younger

182
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,330
and she would serve drinks and those,

183
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:53,163
you know what I'm talking about?

184
00:04:53,163 --> 00:04:54,780
- Like the weird, like right, yes.

185
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,299
They're like the hard plastic cups.

186
00:04:56,299 --> 00:04:57,132
- Yes! - Yes!

187
00:04:57,132 --> 00:04:58,090
- Those exact cups. - Yes I know.

188
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,145
A fancier one. - Yes.

189
00:05:00,145 --> 00:05:01,161
Those just aren't it.

190
00:05:01,161 --> 00:05:04,040
- We talked about anchoring this table with a rug

191
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,270
because-- - Yes.

192
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,820
- You have the dining table

193
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,668
as very much kind of feels connected to that other room

194
00:05:09,668 --> 00:05:10,501
- Yes.

195
00:05:10,501 --> 00:05:11,334
- So in order to make sure

196
00:05:11,334 --> 00:05:12,761
this really feels like its own space

197
00:05:12,761 --> 00:05:14,619
- Yes. - An area rug is key for that.

198
00:05:14,619 --> 00:05:15,452
- I feel that way too,

199
00:05:15,452 --> 00:05:16,285
and as well the table is wood

200
00:05:16,285 --> 00:05:18,119
and the hardwood floor is also wood,

201
00:05:18,119 --> 00:05:19,433
which for me, I don't like. - Right.

202
00:05:19,433 --> 00:05:20,838
So we're gonna separate it. - Then it'll separate it

203
00:05:20,838 --> 00:05:21,671
which is really really nice.

204
00:05:21,671 --> 00:05:24,410
- And you already have some awesome plants

205
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:25,243
you can work with.

206
00:05:25,243 --> 00:05:26,230
- Yeah. - We can order

207
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,610
some more planters and stuff.

208
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:30,910
But really this room is pretty straightforward.

209
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,770
Great, so let's just start simple moving on.

210
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:33,603
- Yes.

211
00:05:33,603 --> 00:05:34,436
- Sisters scoot.

212
00:05:34,436 --> 00:05:35,820
- To the next room! - Yeah!

213
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:39,150
- So the next room in the house is our Sister Office

214
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,843
which needs a little bit of work.

215
00:05:41,843 --> 00:05:43,890
I will say we do work kind of all around the house

216
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:46,030
but I definitely want a good anchor point

217
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:48,220
in the home for everybody to just come,

218
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,230
just get everything done

219
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,669
and to just really focus it.

220
00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:53,360
- We talked about you wanted to do the neon sign.

221
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,193
Right? - Yes.

222
00:05:54,193 --> 00:05:55,068
- Just the Sisters on the outside here.

223
00:05:55,068 --> 00:05:57,042
- So I really want to get a Sisters on the outside

224
00:05:57,042 --> 00:05:58,065
and this was Kate's idea

225
00:05:58,065 --> 00:05:59,550
but I though it would be so,

226
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:00,760
just so cute and fun and chic

227
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,450
just to light up everything in the mood.

228
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:04,000
We're doing white of course, duh.

229
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,198
- Yeah, that's already ordered

230
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,239
- Yes.

231
00:06:06,239 --> 00:06:07,444
We've already got a lot. - On its way.

232
00:06:07,444 --> 00:06:08,400
- We have some art we want to hang--

233
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,660
- We talked about doing floating shelves here

234
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:13,430
just to have additional area

235
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:16,133
for storage but also for some display stuff.

236
00:06:16,133 --> 00:06:18,620
- Then we also ordered three stools

237
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,830
which was your idea - Yeah.

238
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:20,720
- And I love it so if you want

239
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,803
to talk about a little bit.

240
00:06:21,803 --> 00:06:23,197
- Sure, well I was just seeing you have

241
00:06:23,197 --> 00:06:24,370
the two chairs in here

242
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:27,590
but because you want to maybe have some meetings

243
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:28,423
or you also we're talking about how you want

244
00:06:28,423 --> 00:06:30,261
to put your calendar on this TV.

245
00:06:30,261 --> 00:06:31,810
- Yeah, so there was a TV in the triple

246
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:32,643
when we first moved in

247
00:06:32,643 --> 00:06:33,921
and I live my life by my calendar--

248
00:06:33,921 --> 00:06:34,754
- Yeah.

249
00:06:34,754 --> 00:06:35,930
- So I really want to have it displayed

250
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,790
on the TV at all times so I can come in here

251
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,900
check everything and we can have team meetings

252
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,960
and schedule videos and basically everything.

253
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,019
I definitely think some subtle changes

254
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:44,140
in this room will really take it

255
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,470
above and beyond-- - Yeah.

256
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,277
- And it's for the perfect sisters workspace.

257
00:06:47,277 --> 00:06:48,410
- Great, love it.

258
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:51,100
Yeah, organization, functionality, no rug,

259
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,680
it's less about design,

260
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,330
it's more about just pulling it together.

261
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,010
- Yes. - So it is petite but--

262
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,510
- Yes. - A lot has happened in here.

263
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:00,223
- Yes. - Okay, done.

264
00:07:00,223 --> 00:07:02,198
(claps) Yes!

265
00:07:02,198 --> 00:07:04,710
- Alright, so coming out of the office we have one

266
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,134
of the main foyers.

267
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,177
Coming into the kitchen and living room,

268
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:10,550
these are more of the spaces I'm excited about

269
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:13,350
because this is where I spend 80% of my time.

270
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,870
- As do most people. - Right?

271
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,290
- Right, living room and kitchen

272
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:18,670
is where everyone gathers.

273
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:19,610
- Yes, I will say,

274
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:20,720
out of all the spaces that I've done,

275
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,110
this one is obviously not even

276
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,160
close to being decorated but--

277
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,630
- But you did them both in here.

278
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,477
- [James] Yes, but I do like how it looks.

279
00:07:26,477 --> 00:07:28,860
- [Kate] I mean you picked the most amazing,

280
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,190
comfortable couch,

281
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,650
- It's a comfortable couch. - It's gigantic.

282
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,934
Like you're just drawn to it over here.

283
00:07:33,934 --> 00:07:37,010
The hard part is when you have such a big sectional,

284
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:39,080
you want the rug to

285
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,660
match the scale of it.

286
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,560
- [James] Yeah, and this rug is not the right size.

287
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,750
- [Kate] We got a way bigger, like jute,

288
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,112
but white jute rug-- - Yes.

289
00:07:47,112 --> 00:07:48,882
- Which will be so nice and homey.

290
00:07:48,882 --> 00:07:51,065
It's right off of your backyard,

291
00:07:51,065 --> 00:07:53,680
so it has that almost beachy feel to it.

292
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,200
- Right, which I love. - It's cool out there.

293
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,507
And then we talked about getting more accessories

294
00:07:57,507 --> 00:07:58,879
for these built in shelves

295
00:07:58,879 --> 00:07:59,712
because-- - Yes.

296
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:02,210
So basically-- - They're amazing!

297
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:03,043
- They are!

298
00:08:03,043 --> 00:08:03,876
And what happened was

299
00:08:03,876 --> 00:08:05,460
I literally propped up all my decor pieces

300
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,380
from my old apartment

301
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,874
and whenever we moved in the first day,

302
00:08:07,874 --> 00:08:09,290
I just unpacked them

303
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:10,910
and put them all on the shelves randomly

304
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:13,230
to move around later and never moved them around.

305
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,797
And then people come and go

306
00:08:14,797 --> 00:08:15,887
"Oh my god your shelves are so cute."

307
00:08:15,887 --> 00:08:17,753
I'm like, what?

308
00:08:17,753 --> 00:08:19,123
So this definitely needs to be filled way up

309
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:20,410
and what's cool too,

310
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:22,370
is we have a lot of shelf space to work with

311
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:23,320
so definitely allows us

312
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,927
to get a lot of really amazing decor pieces.

313
00:08:24,927 --> 00:08:25,760
- Yes.

314
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,340
- Kate and I are about to go shopping in a little bit

315
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,620
actually to get some fine pieces

316
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,080
so you guys will see that in a few minutes.

317
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,573
So that's pretty much the entire shelf region.

318
00:08:32,573 --> 00:08:33,406
- Yeah.

319
00:08:33,406 --> 00:08:34,239
- So what I'm really excited about

320
00:08:34,239 --> 00:08:35,881
that you actually suggested that I was a little bit--

321
00:08:35,881 --> 00:08:38,020
when you said it, you were like

322
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,272
oh I feel like you need a different coffee table

323
00:08:39,272 --> 00:08:40,664
and I was like-- - Excuse me,

324
00:08:40,664 --> 00:08:41,792
I love this coffee table.

325
00:08:41,792 --> 00:08:42,760
- I love this coffee table

326
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,050
but your thought process behind it

327
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:44,883
I actually really liked.

328
00:08:44,883 --> 00:08:46,023
So why don't you talk a little bit about that.

329
00:08:46,023 --> 00:08:47,595
- Sure, so I was just seeing

330
00:08:47,595 --> 00:08:50,210
that you have this large scale sofa

331
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:52,250
that creates almost a square here.

332
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,310
So seeing a square coffee table seems

333
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:57,400
to be the more organic choice. - Yeah.

334
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,410
- And it'll be just that more accessible

335
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:01,156
for people sitting on this arm--

336
00:09:01,156 --> 00:09:03,030
- Because if you're here--

337
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,707
- Right, you can't...

338
00:09:04,707 --> 00:09:07,613
- Not going to. - And he has long arms.

339
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:08,446
- I'd say.

340
00:09:08,446 --> 00:09:10,290
I really like this table too and what's cool for

341
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,190
if we're actually not getting rid of it,

342
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,622
- No. - We're using it upstairs.

343
00:09:12,622 --> 00:09:14,000
Which we'll get to in a second.

344
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,271
- And then you have that amazing picture that you took.

345
00:09:16,271 --> 00:09:18,114
- Yeah so-- - Right over there.

346
00:09:18,114 --> 00:09:20,545
- So Joey if you want to rotate yourself around there.

347
00:09:20,545 --> 00:09:23,330
We have this huge wall which is blank

348
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,950
and needs to filled pretty badly.

349
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:27,100
We took a few different pictures

350
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,350
that I've took on my travels

351
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,040
and we blew them up in black and white.

352
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,873
We're getting them framed,

353
00:09:30,873 --> 00:09:32,540
so I think they'll be so chic on the walls

354
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,990
just to kind of separate everything.

355
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,100
- So we're just decorating this room, literally.

356
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,680
Bringing in the coffee table, the rug,

357
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,330
shelf accessories, art work on the wall,

358
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,880
just pull it all together.

359
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,910
Just jump off from what you've already started.

360
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:47,760
Alright, the Sisters.

361
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,350
What do we call it? - Outside.

362
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,871
- Sister Outside (laughing).

363
00:09:50,871 --> 00:09:52,430
- This needs a lot of work.

364
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:53,471
- Working on that. - Let's be honest.

365
00:09:53,471 --> 00:09:54,304
- [Kate] Yeah.

366
00:09:54,304 --> 00:09:55,137
- [James] I feel like once again,

367
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:56,730
one of those places that with a few minor changes

368
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:57,784
will really make a big impact.

369
00:09:57,784 --> 00:09:58,617
- [Kate] Yeah.

370
00:09:58,617 --> 00:10:01,000
- We do already have a TV and a cute fireplace out here,

371
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,299
so I feel like just a little seating moment, maybe?

372
00:10:03,299 --> 00:10:04,382
- And then - Yeah.

373
00:10:04,382 --> 00:10:07,480
- Maybe some shady lounge like lawn chair vibe

374
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,601
like right over there. - Yes.

375
00:10:08,601 --> 00:10:09,570
- Like either in the grass

376
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:11,080
with a side table in between.

377
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,130
Really just something for you

378
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:13,850
to come out here and actually sit down.

379
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:14,683
- And relax, yeah.

380
00:10:14,683 --> 00:10:16,480
So that's pretty much the outside.

381
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,430
- Yeah. - All done.

382
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,620
Next place, breakfast stuff. - Yeah.

383
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,899
- [James] Kind of tiny

384
00:10:20,899 --> 00:10:22,060
but I feel like it's important considering

385
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:25,010
it's literally what you see when you walk in the front door.

386
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:26,480
- Totally, right.

387
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,190
You see right down into it - Right smack dab.

388
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:29,410
- And into the backyard.

389
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:30,253
- Yeah. - Yeah.

390
00:10:30,253 --> 00:10:33,220
So you eat here, and there.

391
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,053
- Yes.

392
00:10:34,053 --> 00:10:35,480
- So you actually use this table a lot.

393
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,563
- We do actually.

394
00:10:36,563 --> 00:10:38,510
I just think this space can be a lot more welcoming.

395
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:41,452
This light is literally, it's 10 best.

396
00:10:41,452 --> 00:10:42,285
(Katie Laughing)

397
00:10:42,285 --> 00:10:45,210
It looks like it was a three dollar lamp from Walmart.

398
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:47,180
We have another chair somewhere in the house, I think.

399
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,431
That will be brought back down.

400
00:10:48,431 --> 00:10:50,147
- Okay. (laughing)

401
00:10:50,147 --> 00:10:50,980
- To make the set.

402
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:51,958
And then I think the same thing here,

403
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:52,898
just a centerpiece on the table.

404
00:10:52,898 --> 00:10:54,280
- Right. - So they go together.

405
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,893
- We also talked about doing another piece

406
00:10:55,893 --> 00:10:57,220
of artwork there. - Yes.

407
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,970
- To just mirror image.

408
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:00,540
and then curtains here too,

409
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,380
just to bring in a textiles. - Yes.

410
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:05,000
- So the majority of the windows you have shades

411
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,760
and you also have a lot going on

412
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,614
that curtains don't make sense,

413
00:11:08,614 --> 00:11:10,420
but here they make sense.

414
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,085
You can see how they frame nicely.

415
00:11:12,085 --> 00:11:13,566
- I think they're going to,

416
00:11:13,566 --> 00:11:14,648
yes that's what I was going to say.

417
00:11:14,648 --> 00:11:16,773
They'll make it feel like a lot more comfy-cozy,

418
00:11:16,773 --> 00:11:17,905
- Yeah. - which will be good

419
00:11:17,905 --> 00:11:19,262
because this space definitely needs it.

420
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:20,095
Great.

421
00:11:20,095 --> 00:11:22,000
So that what makes breakfast so easy.

422
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,800
Kitchen, next.

423
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,830
I don't think there's a lot

424
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:26,470
to be done in here which is great

425
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:27,930
because I feel a kitchen is a place

426
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,478
where you don't really decorate that much.

427
00:11:29,478 --> 00:11:31,020
- Well I mean, you have beautiful kitchen,

428
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:31,920
with the finishes and everything,

429
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,180
so you don't have to distract.

430
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:36,082
But yeah, I think a centerpiece there.

431
00:11:36,082 --> 00:11:37,650
- Yes. - Something

432
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:38,947
which maybe we can pick out of the collection

433
00:11:38,947 --> 00:11:41,190
of the beautiful, tall, lengthy,

434
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:44,020
so even if it's just white ceramic

435
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:44,892
or something, so pretty. - Yeah.

436
00:11:44,892 --> 00:11:47,286
So that's pretty much the kitchen as well,

437
00:11:47,286 --> 00:11:48,119
- Yeah. - so it's simple.

438
00:11:48,119 --> 00:11:50,150
- Now we just have upstairs, right?

439
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:50,983
- Should we head up?

440
00:11:50,983 --> 00:11:51,816
- Yes. - Let's go.

441
00:11:51,816 --> 00:11:52,963
- More for our glutes.

442
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:55,595
Up the stairs, we're doing butts.

443
00:11:55,595 --> 00:11:56,428
- [James] Ready?

444
00:11:56,428 --> 00:11:57,361
(laughing)

445
00:11:57,361 --> 00:11:59,285
- Oh God, I've got to hold my boobs.

446
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:02,118
This is my first time doing cardio.

447
00:12:02,118 --> 00:12:03,751
- (laughing) It's great.

448
00:12:03,751 --> 00:12:06,659
- Oh great, this is a paramount.

449
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:09,770
- Okay, welcome to the upstairs.

450
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:10,780
I'm very very excited about this

451
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:11,613
because the to of my favorite rooms

452
00:12:11,613 --> 00:12:13,210
in the entire house are up here;

453
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,100
my master and the Sister Studio.

454
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,149
So-- - Oh my God.

455
00:12:17,149 --> 00:12:19,734
- You good? - Sister winded please,

456
00:12:19,734 --> 00:12:21,370
I'm what can we do about it?

457
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:23,060
Yeah, so this landing is great

458
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,960
because it's wide, it's epic,

459
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,406
you got your bedroom here,

460
00:12:27,406 --> 00:12:29,052
you got your beauty room over there.

461
00:12:29,052 --> 00:12:30,297
- This all is going to my least favorite wall

462
00:12:30,297 --> 00:12:31,130
in the entire house.

463
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:33,340
I think these built ins are so ugly

464
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:35,420
and I just don't, like why?

465
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:38,521
- Well we just talked about doing pillows here

466
00:12:38,521 --> 00:12:39,672
- Yes. - on the benches.

467
00:12:39,672 --> 00:12:41,293
- And once again somewhat similar to downstairs,

468
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:42,673
there's just lots of shelf space

469
00:12:42,673 --> 00:12:44,820
that we should fill up with some cool pieces.

470
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,150
Just so we can be a little bit more put together.

471
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:47,983
We can't get rid of this

472
00:12:47,983 --> 00:12:49,280
so we may as well make it look great

473
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,113
while it's here.

474
00:12:50,113 --> 00:12:50,946
- Yeah.

475
00:12:50,946 --> 00:12:51,779
- So this wall is completely blank right now

476
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:53,380
and that's because what was here

477
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,260
is currently being customized.

478
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,340
So you guys know as YouTubers,

479
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,660
when we hit certain milestones,

480
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,300
we always get our little plaque

481
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,723
which is always super super exciting-

482
00:13:01,723 --> 00:13:02,556
- Really exciting.

483
00:13:02,556 --> 00:13:03,630
- And an amazing this to work towards.

484
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:07,120
So I have my one million plaque standing right here

485
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,270
but I just got my 10 million plaque

486
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:12,360
which is so crazy. - Oh my God such a milestone!

487
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,618
- That's crazy! - That's so awesome.

488
00:13:13,618 --> 00:13:15,390
- Oh it's been so exciting-- - It's so cool.

489
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,455
- And obviously that took a lot of time

490
00:13:17,455 --> 00:13:18,288
and a lot of hard work

491
00:13:18,288 --> 00:13:20,278
and I want to display it in a really cool way--

492
00:13:20,278 --> 00:13:22,360
- But, it was a really cool idea that you had

493
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,082
because the plaque comes as,

494
00:13:24,082 --> 00:13:26,490
it's just more as a trophy. - Right.

495
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:27,323
- Kind of thing, right?

496
00:13:27,323 --> 00:13:28,650
It's like that big play button.

497
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:29,483
- Yeah.

498
00:13:29,483 --> 00:13:30,916
- It's not framed like the one million plaque--

499
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:31,987
- Right, so--

500
00:13:31,987 --> 00:13:35,777
- But this designer right here was like,

501
00:13:35,777 --> 00:13:37,380
"let's frame it!" - Let's frame it!

502
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,760
So I really like how the one million plaque

503
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,400
was displayed like the gold play button

504
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,762
inside the big shadowbox.

505
00:13:42,762 --> 00:13:46,208
So I took both the one million and 10 million

506
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:48,904
to a custom framer here in California

507
00:13:48,904 --> 00:13:51,140
and we are getting them both reframed

508
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,427
because I even though I like the one million one,

509
00:13:52,427 --> 00:13:53,811
I didn't really like the grey background.

510
00:13:53,811 --> 00:13:54,894
Kind of ugly.

511
00:13:54,894 --> 00:13:57,153
- I love how you're customizing your own plaques.

512
00:13:57,153 --> 00:13:59,913
- We're going to cut it open-- - Sorry YouTube!

513
00:13:59,913 --> 00:14:02,275
Let's redesign everything- - It's hilarious.

514
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:04,720
Cutting it open, taking the one million out

515
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,400
and were also getting the 10 million

516
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,110
huge diamond play button costumed framed

517
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,570
so they'll be in matching frames

518
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:12,400
and there will be the one million

519
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,414
and the 10 million,

520
00:14:13,414 --> 00:14:15,320
right here, exactly matching.

521
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,100
Looking beautiful and fun and fashion chic.

522
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,063
I think it will be a really amazing way

523
00:14:18,063 --> 00:14:20,090
just to look back at all my achievements right

524
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:21,800
before you come into the Sister Studio.

525
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,483
Which brings us to the next room in the house.

526
00:14:24,483 --> 00:14:27,589
The Sister Studio. - Sister Studio!

527
00:14:27,589 --> 00:14:29,885
Oh my gosh, this room is so important.

528
00:14:29,885 --> 00:14:31,429
- So-- - It's crazy.

529
00:14:31,429 --> 00:14:33,620
- The Sister Studio is probably,

530
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,752
honestly my favorite room of the entire house.

531
00:14:35,752 --> 00:14:39,040
I love equipment and videography and lighting

532
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,680
and just trying to see how I can really elevate myself

533
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,072
and make my content that much better.

534
00:14:43,072 --> 00:14:45,020
So for me, this studio has like

535
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,610
a dream project of mine forever

536
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:49,210
just to really have the best production space

537
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:50,960
humanly possible to make my content the best

538
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,240
for all of my sisters watching.

539
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,073
- Totally.

540
00:14:53,073 --> 00:14:54,770
- As you can see, there's a full on metal cage

541
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:57,214
that we built in this room-- - Which is rad, yeah.

542
00:14:57,214 --> 00:14:58,047
- [James] Which is so cool.

543
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,090
And basically that's where basically all the equipment

544
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:01,630
hangs from which is amazing because it takes everything

545
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:02,760
off of the floor,

546
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,390
which makes the decorating way better.

547
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,150
It makes it feel a lot bigger

548
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,637
because this room was very very crammed at first.

549
00:15:07,637 --> 00:15:10,403
- Yeah, I mean you host people like Kim Kardashian

550
00:15:10,403 --> 00:15:12,094
in this room-- - Yeah.

551
00:15:12,094 --> 00:15:14,330
- So you want to have it be

552
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,760
a little bit more like a studio feel.

553
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,593
- Right.

554
00:15:16,593 --> 00:15:18,221
- So like this table and the table below--

555
00:15:18,221 --> 00:15:19,054
- Has to go.

556
00:15:19,054 --> 00:15:20,476
- [Kate] We talked a lot about this table.

557
00:15:20,476 --> 00:15:22,000
- This table has been at the source

558
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,180
of so much stress about this--

559
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,561
- [Kate] Our most emails back and forth have been

560
00:15:25,561 --> 00:15:27,130
about this table. - Literally, let me finish.

561
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:29,651
So for me, this table is literally from Ikea.

562
00:15:29,651 --> 00:15:31,160
I got this when I first moved here

563
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,203
and It was great at first-- - Yeah

564
00:15:32,203 --> 00:15:33,883
- But my videos are just getting bigger

565
00:15:33,883 --> 00:15:35,122
and bigger production wise

566
00:15:35,122 --> 00:15:36,780
and if had any other videos,

567
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,104
this entire table would be like,

568
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:39,981
if I pick anything up everything else would fall off.

569
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:41,360
- Absolutely. - Like it's bad.

570
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,193
- Yeah.

571
00:15:42,193 --> 00:15:43,680
- So a bigger table to work on

572
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,740
and to not feel so cluttered.

573
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,086
- Is going to be great for your brain.

574
00:15:47,086 --> 00:15:47,919
- Biggest thing. - Yeah.

575
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:49,513
So we found that table with--

576
00:15:49,513 --> 00:15:51,851
- We found the table, God bless.

577
00:15:51,851 --> 00:15:53,317
Thank God. - Yes.

578
00:15:53,317 --> 00:15:54,683
- We really wanted a seating area on this end

579
00:15:54,683 --> 00:15:56,592
because like I said, we do film a lot of bigger collabs

580
00:15:56,592 --> 00:15:58,731
and if I'm bringing a celebrity client,

581
00:15:58,731 --> 00:16:00,670
sometimes they bring their team or their manager over

582
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:01,859
or even if its like bigger collabs,

583
00:16:01,859 --> 00:16:03,445
and only one person on the screen,

584
00:16:03,445 --> 00:16:04,652
friends will be chilling here.

585
00:16:04,652 --> 00:16:05,485
- Right.

586
00:16:05,485 --> 00:16:06,318
- And all time time I'm filming alone

587
00:16:06,318 --> 00:16:07,830
and my manager and my assistant and my writer

588
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:09,520
will all be here watching.

589
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,400
I just want a comfortable space

590
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,000
for everybody to just once again

591
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,620
have it feel like an actual studio.

592
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,347
- Okay so we were going to do a little couch,

593
00:16:16,347 --> 00:16:17,903
like a little, almost like a bench

594
00:16:17,903 --> 00:16:19,930
with a back on it. - Yeah, for the sitting area.

595
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:22,689
- And then, you texted me around Christmastime.

596
00:16:22,689 --> 00:16:23,522
- Yes.

597
00:16:23,522 --> 00:16:24,355
- We met over Christmas

598
00:16:24,355 --> 00:16:25,401
and you were like this is the plan.

599
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,297
And you were like,

600
00:16:26,297 --> 00:16:29,850
"Okay Ethan got me a custom bench."

601
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:31,347
- [James] Which is literally so cool.

602
00:16:31,347 --> 00:16:33,064
- So cool. - And so sweet.

603
00:16:33,064 --> 00:16:35,660
If you guys saw my collab with The Dolan Twins and Emma,

604
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:38,220
this is just fun for our Christmas video.

605
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,373
Ethan got me a customed Sisters bench

606
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,965
which I think is so incredibly cute

607
00:16:41,965 --> 00:16:43,320
and he literally got it for me

608
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,477
because of the fact that we've filmed

609
00:16:44,477 --> 00:16:45,560
so many collabs together

610
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,112
where our butts are literally broken by then end of it

611
00:16:48,112 --> 00:16:49,830
and we cannot feel it either. - And you all have

612
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:51,290
very small butts.

613
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:54,077
I mean, well I mean thick,

614
00:16:54,077 --> 00:16:57,155
thick, thick butts, but not.

615
00:16:57,155 --> 00:16:58,310
Well anyways.

616
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:01,670
You all have lovely thick butts

617
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,621
and we need a think bench for support.

618
00:17:03,621 --> 00:17:04,454
- Yeah to sit on

619
00:17:04,454 --> 00:17:05,470
so we don't literally break our backs

620
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,600
by the time we're done filming.

621
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,433
But since we thought

622
00:17:07,433 --> 00:17:08,870
since it's usually just me filming,

623
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:11,170
we could really easily use Ethan's Sisters bench

624
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:12,838
and put it against this wall

625
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:14,600
and decorate it with pillows

626
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,549
so that everyone is really comfortable

627
00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:17,382
and then that way too,

628
00:17:17,382 --> 00:17:18,620
we can also see the custom Sisters

629
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,241
on the front-- - Exactly, beautiful, lit up.

630
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:22,693
Because it actually lit up, right?

631
00:17:22,693 --> 00:17:24,208
- Yeah it's actually full LED. - Yeah you can plug it in.

632
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:25,041
- It's so cool. - Yeah.

633
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:26,309
- And of course if we have a bigger collab,

634
00:17:26,309 --> 00:17:27,350
then we can move the bench quickly

635
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,457
over to there-- - Swap them out.

636
00:17:28,457 --> 00:17:29,347
- So we can sit more comfortably.

637
00:17:29,347 --> 00:17:30,340
- Yep I love that.

638
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,767
So this is the wall when you walk in the door

639
00:17:31,767 --> 00:17:33,867
to the Sisters studio, you see this wall.

640
00:17:33,867 --> 00:17:34,849
- This is what they see.

641
00:17:34,849 --> 00:17:35,682
Kate had this really cool idea.

642
00:17:35,682 --> 00:17:38,750
- Well we were just talking about doing a custom sign.

643
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,350
You wanted to use Sister Studio.

644
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:43,338
So you did kind of like a splatter paint thing.

645
00:17:43,338 --> 00:17:45,250
- Yes - With Sisters Studios

646
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,150
and then we're having it custom made

647
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:50,050
on acrylic with then a stand-off

648
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:50,883
of the Sisters Studio

649
00:17:50,883 --> 00:17:51,953
so it's going to be black and white

650
00:17:51,953 --> 00:17:52,786
of course-- - Of course, duh.

651
00:17:52,786 --> 00:17:53,680
- Keeping with the aesthetic,

652
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,513
but then you'll walk in

653
00:17:54,513 --> 00:17:56,709
and see this big, giant Sister Studio.

654
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:58,430
- Should we got to-- - The Master's?

655
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:00,705
- The last and final where all the magic happens?

656
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:02,415
Hmmm not a lot magic happends there let's be real.

657
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,103
- We're working on that. - We're working on that.

658
00:18:04,103 --> 00:18:06,025
- Once we figure out that room there's going

659
00:18:06,025 --> 00:18:08,073
to be lots of magic.

660
00:18:08,073 --> 00:18:09,699
The Master.

661
00:18:09,699 --> 00:18:12,793
(laughing) Yes!

662
00:18:12,793 --> 00:18:13,626
- The master bedroom.

663
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:16,500
- Oh my God, I've never seen someone

664
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,234
back that ass up into the bedroom first.

665
00:18:19,234 --> 00:18:21,757
- So the last bedroom I'm very very excited for

666
00:18:21,757 --> 00:18:24,790
because this is the space I'm in.

667
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:26,100
- This is your Sisters Suite

668
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:26,933
- Yes.

669
00:18:26,933 --> 00:18:29,040
So luckily this is really just an amazing suite

670
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,810
for me to kind of unwind at the end of the day.

671
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,362
So we already have a few major pieces

672
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,017
and here is what we got started.

673
00:18:35,017 --> 00:18:38,893
Spoiler alert, if you'll notice I have no bed right now.

674
00:18:40,945 --> 00:18:42,882
- Yes because Joey took it.

675
00:18:42,882 --> 00:18:44,940
- Yes Joey stole my bed.

676
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,400
So as soon as we walked in here, Joey noticed.

677
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,453
- So your bed was a little bit small, right.

678
00:18:49,453 --> 00:18:50,814
Just four-post bed.

679
00:18:50,814 --> 00:18:51,647
Four-poster?

680
00:18:51,647 --> 00:18:52,660
Four-post?

681
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,700
- [James and Kate] Four-poster.

682
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,060
- Four-poster bed

683
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,534
and because your ceiling goes at an incline,

684
00:18:57,534 --> 00:18:58,367
it just-- - It does.

685
00:18:58,367 --> 00:19:01,500
- [Joey] It looked a little short.

686
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,730
So we're going to keep it platform

687
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:05,350
but I'm basically just going to rebuild all the posts

688
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,549
and make it that much taller

689
00:19:06,549 --> 00:19:08,826
so it looks that much more grand.

690
00:19:08,826 --> 00:19:10,770
- But keep it in the platform style

691
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:12,318
which is the style that you like.

692
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:13,226
- [James] Right, for sure.

693
00:19:13,226 --> 00:19:14,810
- Kind of like that lower, more minimal vibe.

694
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:17,013
Okay so what we talked about in here obviously

695
00:19:17,013 --> 00:19:18,850
just really completing the space.

696
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:19,683
- Yeah.

697
00:19:19,683 --> 00:19:20,516
- Because you have your bed

698
00:19:20,516 --> 00:19:22,470
that's being augmented,

699
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,730
but this side of the room is pretty much good.

700
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:25,563
- Yes.

701
00:19:25,563 --> 00:19:27,290
- But this side of the room is totally empty

702
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:28,278
It's like the ottoman

703
00:19:28,278 --> 00:19:30,560
- Right. - needs has space here.

704
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,430
This wants to be a living room.

705
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,730
Like in order to make it a suite,

706
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:36,760
you have a living space attached

707
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,389
to your sleeping space. - Right.

708
00:19:38,389 --> 00:19:39,881
- It's going to be so elegant. - Right.

709
00:19:39,881 --> 00:19:40,714
- And cozy.

710
00:19:40,714 --> 00:19:42,120
- So Kate had the really really good idea

711
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,200
of putting a full-on, third living room

712
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,860
in the house with a sofa and two chairs.

713
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,405
Which I think is going to be so cute.

714
00:19:47,405 --> 00:19:48,238
- So cute.

715
00:19:48,238 --> 00:19:49,960
- We picked out literally the best stuff ever

716
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,720
and CVQ is literally right downstairs

717
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,057
right now delivering everything.

718
00:19:53,057 --> 00:19:55,020
#nosponsored but please.

719
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,540
- But it should be! - It should be.

720
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,840
I think that will have the master bedroom feel a lot more,

721
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,310
like you said, like actual suite,

722
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:02,020
for I can like relax and chill in.

723
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:05,010
In summary, we're building you a bigger bed,

724
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,750
we are having this be a modular piece

725
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:07,700
either here or there,

726
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,980
we're creating a living space anchored with the rug,

727
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,388
we're bringing the coffee table from downstairs up here,

728
00:20:12,388 --> 00:20:14,280
and we're style the shelves

729
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,711
and just making it a Sister Suite.

730
00:20:15,711 --> 00:20:17,340
- Is all the from the shelf store?

731
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,857
- I think so.

732
00:20:18,857 --> 00:20:19,690
Are we done?

733
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:20,639
- Are we done?

734
00:20:20,639 --> 00:20:22,556
- [Joey] It's time to shop.

735
00:20:22,556 --> 00:20:23,984
- James!

736
00:20:23,984 --> 00:20:27,313
(upbeat music) (laughing)

737
00:20:27,313 --> 00:20:28,240
- Alright you guys.

738
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,447
So we just arrived at HomeGoods

739
00:20:29,447 --> 00:20:31,820
and we're going to be basically do decor shopping.

740
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,070
All day today. - All the accessories.

741
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:35,600
Thankfully we ordered all the large items online

742
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,020
which is great because we don't have

743
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:37,993
to cram them in your Tesla.

744
00:20:37,993 --> 00:20:38,826
- Right.

745
00:20:38,826 --> 00:20:40,300
- They're being delivered.

746
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,630
- They're being delivered, thank God.

747
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:43,290
- So we are here for all those accessories,

748
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:46,130
the shelf items, the table top items,

749
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:49,010
trays, centerpieces, faux plants galore.

750
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:50,110
Like, we're just going to fill it up

751
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,150
because you can always return

752
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:51,983
so I always say,

753
00:20:51,983 --> 00:20:53,640
buy more than you need. - More is better.

754
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,670
- Yeah, see what we can get here

755
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,250
and if we need to, go to another store.

756
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,720
But like-- - We have lots of options.

757
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,553
We have all day. - Yeah.

758
00:20:58,553 --> 00:21:00,035
- [Joey] Perfect, totally your aesthetic.

759
00:21:00,035 --> 00:21:02,720
(laughing) - Joey you're fired.

760
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,086
- This one for your master.

761
00:21:05,086 --> 00:21:06,930
Because you have the smaller ones right?

762
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:07,858
- True, yeah.

763
00:21:07,858 --> 00:21:09,036
I feel like this actually is not bad.

764
00:21:09,036 --> 00:21:10,773
- Cute, I love it.

765
00:21:10,773 --> 00:21:11,697
Like a little topiary.

766
00:21:11,697 --> 00:21:13,040
- Just super simple and minimal.

767
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,943
- I mean, I love crystals.

768
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,003
What is that smear?

769
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:21,560
(laughing)

770
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,580
- Okay, so we were talking about doing

771
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,533
like a gathering of taller vases,

772
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:24,874
like maybe on your kitchen island--

773
00:21:24,874 --> 00:21:25,940
- Yeah, or somewhere.

774
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:28,960
- You have centerpiece situation potential

775
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,307
for the dining table.

776
00:21:30,307 --> 00:21:31,140
- Do you like this?

777
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:31,973
- I love that.

778
00:21:31,973 --> 00:21:33,620
I love like also mixing it with,

779
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,807
there's this other textured one up there.

780
00:21:35,807 --> 00:21:38,310
- Ew, it looks like octopus tentacles.

781
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,143
- Got it.

782
00:21:39,143 --> 00:21:41,330
No octopus, okay.

783
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:42,163
What about this one?

784
00:21:42,163 --> 00:21:43,337
- Oh I like that. - Right?

785
00:21:43,337 --> 00:21:44,887
- Pretty, that will be pretty.

786
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:46,830
It has a little bit more of the natural tone

787
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:49,050
coming through, look.

788
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:50,540
Sisters not twins. - That'll look good together.

789
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,480
Right, I love that.

790
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,313
- Too thick?

791
00:21:53,185 --> 00:21:54,233
- I do love a thick sister.

792
00:21:54,233 --> 00:21:55,559
- We do like thick sisters.

793
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:58,210
- That'll be good actually. - Here, okay.

794
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:00,640
- Oh I was saying this is like your aesthetic

795
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,473
on the globe.

796
00:22:01,473 --> 00:22:02,306
- Yeah. - Right?

797
00:22:02,306 --> 00:22:03,830
- Do you like the smaller one better?

798
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:04,980
Because I love the accent of the gold.

799
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:07,390
- Okay well actually the smaller one is probably good

800
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:08,689
because-- - It'll fit on the shelf.

801
00:22:08,689 --> 00:22:09,522
- Oh, love that.

802
00:22:09,522 --> 00:22:11,283
Perfect, geometric-- - And oh--

803
00:22:11,283 --> 00:22:13,050
- I think that's their display.

804
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:14,689
(Joey and Kate Laughing)

805
00:22:14,689 --> 00:22:16,730
- We can take it, what are they going to do about it?

806
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:19,300
- Yeah, let's be like, put a price on it.

807
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,008
We'll take it.

808
00:22:21,008 --> 00:22:22,006
An hourglass?

809
00:22:22,006 --> 00:22:24,360
- Ew, that sand is disgusting.

810
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,449
- Okay, rude.

811
00:22:25,449 --> 00:22:26,500
What about this?

812
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,850
This is a chic.

813
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:28,846
Is it too gold?

814
00:22:28,846 --> 00:22:29,690
- A what?

815
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:31,111
- It's too gold for you?

816
00:22:31,111 --> 00:22:32,415
- Oh, I thought you said a pa-too-gold.

817
00:22:32,415 --> 00:22:33,530
(laughing)

818
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:35,941
- I could just make up words.

819
00:22:35,941 --> 00:22:36,903
This is a pa-too-gold.

820
00:22:36,903 --> 00:22:38,780
- Yeah, I actually don't mind it.

821
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:39,613
- Right?

822
00:22:39,613 --> 00:22:40,446
I don't mind it either.

823
00:22:40,446 --> 00:22:42,867
I just love, love, love the shape of it.

824
00:22:42,867 --> 00:22:44,316
Very much-- - What would you put in there?

825
00:22:44,316 --> 00:22:45,149
- It could be anywhere,

826
00:22:45,149 --> 00:22:46,020
depends on where you put it;

827
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:50,227
entryway, keys, whatever, on the coffee table, remotes.

828
00:22:50,227 --> 00:22:51,801
- Let's do it. - Let's do it.

829
00:22:51,801 --> 00:22:52,760
- I'll trust you on the gold.

830
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,593
- Great.

831
00:22:53,593 --> 00:22:55,377
Oh my God, is this a freakin' silver slinky?

832
00:22:55,377 --> 00:22:57,131
- That's what I had in my hand.

833
00:22:57,131 --> 00:22:57,964
- And do you really like it?

834
00:22:57,964 --> 00:22:58,797
- It's kind of cool.

835
00:22:58,797 --> 00:22:59,805
- I love it.

836
00:22:59,805 --> 00:23:00,638
- Kind of fun right?

837
00:23:00,638 --> 00:23:02,081
- It's a silver slinky, yes.

838
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:04,110
Wait, this was before your time though.

839
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,080
You were born after this was popular.

840
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,260
- I know what a slinky is!

841
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,230
You watch your attitude.

842
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,093
(laughing)

843
00:23:08,093 --> 00:23:09,370
I'm not that young.

844
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:11,600
- Do you like crystals because you know I love crystals?

845
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,433
Do you like them white? - I do.

846
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:13,911
- I think they're pretty. - I love a white crystal.

847
00:23:13,911 --> 00:23:14,744
- Yes.

848
00:23:14,744 --> 00:23:16,020
Did you grab one of theses?

849
00:23:16,857 --> 00:23:18,003
- Ew. - Too hammered?

850
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,000
- Hammered, I love that.

851
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,482
- Oh wait, there's a sleeker one underneath it.

852
00:23:24,482 --> 00:23:25,364
- Do you like that?

853
00:23:25,364 --> 00:23:29,260
- For like down like the dining room table potentially

854
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,510
or even under the vases

855
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,260
on your long weird shelves

856
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:35,310
under your TV in the family room.

857
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,202
Not weird, glorious.

858
00:23:36,202 --> 00:23:37,680
- They are a little strange.

859
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,527
- Right? - That could be good.

860
00:23:38,527 --> 00:23:39,800
- You know, 'cause then,

861
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,010
'cause even just having something reflective

862
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:43,981
under something else, is nice.

863
00:23:43,981 --> 00:23:47,217
It just kind of amplifies. - Okay.

864
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:49,086
- [Joey] And to finish it all off.

865
00:23:49,086 --> 00:23:51,810
- [Kate] Oh, burlap elephant!

866
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:52,820
- [Joey] Totally your aesthetic.

867
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:55,870
(Joey laughing)

868
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:57,040
- What is this?

869
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:57,873
- I picked that up.

870
00:23:57,873 --> 00:23:59,140
I don't think it will really fit anywhere

871
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,190
but it is kind of chic.

872
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,023
- I like it.

873
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:02,003
- It could be on the coffee table by itself.

874
00:24:02,003 --> 00:24:04,630
- Or on, do you have a mantle in your bedroom?

875
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:05,463
Or no?

876
00:24:05,463 --> 00:24:06,296
You don't have an actual mantle.

877
00:24:06,296 --> 00:24:07,129
- No.

878
00:24:07,129 --> 00:24:08,550
- But you do have a counter ledge.

879
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:09,440
- Oh on the side!

880
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,273
Yes we do.

881
00:24:10,273 --> 00:24:11,337
- Yeah - Yeah. Okay.

882
00:24:11,337 --> 00:24:12,183
We can do this.

883
00:24:12,183 --> 00:24:13,200
- [James] Look at this?

884
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,590
- Oh, I love that.

885
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:17,330
Yeah, a nice, like aged patina to go with that.

886
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,153
'Cause that is-- - (laughing) Patina.

887
00:24:20,028 --> 00:24:20,980
- But, what? Patina?

888
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,246
- I'll put too gold.

889
00:24:22,246 --> 00:24:24,051
- No but I-- - Patina's a real word.

890
00:24:24,051 --> 00:24:25,123
- Patina's a real word.

891
00:24:25,123 --> 00:24:27,687
- I'll put too gold and patina.

892
00:24:27,687 --> 00:24:28,520
I like that a lot.

893
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,353
- You like that, okay.

894
00:24:29,353 --> 00:24:30,535
- Let's grab that. - Okay.

895
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:32,375
- Ew. - Yeah, that's a little gross.

896
00:24:32,375 --> 00:24:33,889
- This is kind of chic though. - Yeah, love that.

897
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:37,738
That's very, at the farm house vibe in your house.

898
00:24:37,738 --> 00:24:39,120
- I really like this a lot.

899
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:39,953
- Yeah, I love that.

900
00:24:39,953 --> 00:24:41,203
- We can put a beefy candle in here.

901
00:24:41,203 --> 00:24:43,786
(upbeat music)

902
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:47,704
- [Joey] I found the perfect one.

903
00:24:47,704 --> 00:24:49,787
- Oh no, Joey. - Joey why?

904
00:24:51,234 --> 00:24:52,651
- Oh my God. - So-

905
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,515
- [Joey] T, T? (laughing)

906
00:24:57,515 --> 00:25:00,743
- I'm so scared for these little kids.

907
00:25:00,743 --> 00:25:03,470
- What about a simple frame with a matte?

908
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:06,000
Because this on its side I think would fit

909
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,370
within one of the shelves.

910
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:09,546
- [Joey] Wait, where's our other cart?

911
00:25:09,546 --> 00:25:11,340
- Oh, right.

912
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,173
James!

913
00:25:13,083 --> 00:25:14,943
- Oh it's right here, I got it.

914
00:25:14,943 --> 00:25:16,302
This says create, its kind of cute.

915
00:25:16,302 --> 00:25:17,201
- That is cute.

916
00:25:17,201 --> 00:25:18,875
I love how simple that is.

917
00:25:18,875 --> 00:25:19,813
- Look at this. - Create.

918
00:25:19,813 --> 00:25:21,950
- This is such a chic little pencil holder.

919
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:22,783
It's at an angle. - Yes!

920
00:25:22,783 --> 00:25:25,070
That's so your vibe. - Let's grab this too.

921
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:25,903
- Look at these together.

922
00:25:25,903 --> 00:25:27,337
Oh my gosh. - So good.

923
00:25:27,337 --> 00:25:28,170
- Coming together.

924
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:29,163
Oh my gosh, I love this.

925
00:25:29,163 --> 00:25:30,138
This is so fun.

926
00:25:30,138 --> 00:25:31,240
- Just left the doctor,

927
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,370
let me know what you think.

928
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:34,965
- Like what about up on the desk?

929
00:25:34,965 --> 00:25:36,549
- I don't know if it would fit anywhere.

930
00:25:36,549 --> 00:25:38,457
- Let's get it.

931
00:25:38,457 --> 00:25:40,593
(laughing) - Great.

932
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,360
- [Kate] Alright, here's what we got so far.

933
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:47,400
You can see Jame's aesthetic

934
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,120
is apparent

935
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,960
in the shopping cart.

936
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,540
Face tuning in the aisle.

937
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,700
- I just posted on Instagram, Kate.

938
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,104
- [Kate] Well I know, we're in a long line.

939
00:25:58,104 --> 00:25:59,090
Do it.

940
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:01,530
Alright, the load in.

941
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:03,400
Let's see how much this Tesla can handle.

942
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,233
- Probably a lot.

943
00:26:04,233 --> 00:26:05,210
- [Kate] Probably a lot.

944
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:06,120
It's an SUV.

945
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,310
- How many pieces did we end up picking up?

946
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,430
45 I think she said?

947
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:09,900
- [Kate] Yep, 45 items.

948
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:13,380
- So we're definitely on a good path to decor.

949
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,610
- [Kate] Yeah I think that,

950
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:16,670
let's stop by Target really quick

951
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:19,040
and grab just some other like throw blankets

952
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,198
and other doodads and we're good.

953
00:26:21,198 --> 00:26:22,382
- We're going to target.

954
00:26:22,382 --> 00:26:23,923
- We're going to Target! - Oh we're going to Target!

955
00:26:23,923 --> 00:26:24,756
(clapping)

956
00:26:24,756 --> 00:26:26,110
- Alright, so we just loaded the car,

957
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:28,163
we loaded our bellies plus one

958
00:26:28,163 --> 00:26:29,066
- I was just about to say that!

959
00:26:29,066 --> 00:26:31,193
- Oh my God! - Love that frost.

960
00:26:31,193 --> 00:26:32,718
- I do love that frost.

961
00:26:32,718 --> 00:26:34,360
And we have Drew joining us too at Target.

962
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,193
- He's in a separate car

963
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:37,789
but we're heading over to Target to get more bits and bobs.

964
00:26:37,789 --> 00:26:38,630
- Yup.

965
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:39,463
And items that have jacks.

966
00:26:39,463 --> 00:26:40,970
- Yup throw blankets and trays.

967
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:42,014
- See you there. - Decor.

968
00:26:42,014 --> 00:26:45,091
- So we want some more options to find that much.

969
00:26:45,091 --> 00:26:45,924
- Yes.

970
00:26:45,924 --> 00:26:46,757
- We want throw blankets

971
00:26:46,757 --> 00:26:48,109
and let's just get some more. - Everything.

972
00:26:48,109 --> 00:26:48,942
Bits and bobs.

973
00:26:48,942 --> 00:26:50,275
- Bits and bobs!

974
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:52,976
- Oh yeah, so cute! - It's a good pillow.

975
00:26:52,976 --> 00:26:54,117
- [Kate] Good pillow.

976
00:26:54,117 --> 00:26:54,980
- [Joey] And I should be able to pick on thing

977
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,770
from every store for you.

978
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:58,207
I think this is totally you aesthetic.

979
00:26:58,207 --> 00:27:01,381
- Joey I-- (laughing)

980
00:27:01,381 --> 00:27:02,493
That's disgusting.

981
00:27:02,493 --> 00:27:03,642
- [Kate] One minute in.

982
00:27:03,642 --> 00:27:06,767
- That child needs to stop screaming immediately.

983
00:27:06,767 --> 00:27:09,103
- [Kate] What about this simple bookend?

984
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:11,740
- No. - No, okay.

985
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,273
- This is much better than the other one.

986
00:27:13,273 --> 00:27:15,742
- No but it's not-- - That one looks cheap.

987
00:27:15,742 --> 00:27:16,575
- Different.

988
00:27:16,575 --> 00:27:18,767
(gasps)

989
00:27:18,767 --> 00:27:20,050
- I like that one.

990
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:21,450
But you can have two.

991
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:23,087
Remember how many shelves we have.

992
00:27:23,087 --> 00:27:23,920
- True.

993
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,520
- [Drew] I think we probably need this.

994
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,843
- [James] What?

995
00:27:26,843 --> 00:27:29,170
- I don't know, to put options in.

996
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:30,515
- Oh yes! - That's kind of cute.

997
00:27:30,515 --> 00:27:31,348
- Yeah. - No, I like that!

998
00:27:31,348 --> 00:27:32,181
A simple tray.

999
00:27:32,181 --> 00:27:33,120
- See you questioned it and then you liked it.

1000
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,054
- Yeah, good, good, good.

1001
00:27:34,054 --> 00:27:34,887
- Yeah. - Great.

1002
00:27:34,887 --> 00:27:36,098
- I like both of these - Yeah, Yeah.

1003
00:27:36,098 --> 00:27:37,131
Love that.

1004
00:27:37,131 --> 00:27:39,218
- Oh it's heavier than I thought.

1005
00:27:39,218 --> 00:27:40,083
- [Kate] Love the matte

1006
00:27:40,083 --> 00:27:43,487
because we got some shiny finished ones at Homegoods

1007
00:27:43,487 --> 00:27:44,320
- I like these a lot.

1008
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,500
- So those are beautiful mixed in.

1009
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,530
(upbeat music)

1010
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:51,540
- Oh look how chic these planters are.

1011
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,639
- Love!

1012
00:27:52,639 --> 00:27:54,450
- That's the best planter I ever did see.

1013
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:55,323
- Oh, perfect!

1014
00:27:55,323 --> 00:27:56,758
- We'll be needing this. - Yeah.

1015
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:57,974
- Oh look at those baskets!

1016
00:27:57,974 --> 00:27:59,777
Those cork baskets are so good.

1017
00:27:59,777 --> 00:28:01,080
- (gasps) Ooh.

1018
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,756
- Wow, that's the best purchase ever.

1019
00:28:03,756 --> 00:28:05,749
Wow, the cart got closer than I was expecting.

1020
00:28:05,749 --> 00:28:06,968
Should we buy it? - Yeah.

1021
00:28:06,968 --> 00:28:07,801
- Oh wait.

1022
00:28:07,801 --> 00:28:09,400
- Oh my god you said that about the fake plant

1023
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,347
and the baby just kicked me in my belly,

1024
00:28:11,347 --> 00:28:13,613
so he approves of the fake plant.

1025
00:28:14,575 --> 00:28:15,430
- I like this a lot.

1026
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:18,086
- Leaning in the family room.

1027
00:28:18,086 --> 00:28:19,760
(laughing)

1028
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,920
or when you're having a Sister Santa moment

1029
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:25,027
when you just want to mount here mantle.

1030
00:28:25,027 --> 00:28:26,321
- I love mounting my mantle.

1031
00:28:26,321 --> 00:28:27,800
- Okay, great. - I think that's good.

1032
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,686
- I love it.

1033
00:28:28,686 --> 00:28:31,269
(upbeat music)

1034
00:28:35,646 --> 00:28:39,258
- Here are things James will never use.

1035
00:28:39,258 --> 00:28:40,413
- [James] This is so true.

1036
00:28:40,413 --> 00:28:43,515
- Do you want a rolling pin? - Definitely.

1037
00:28:43,515 --> 00:28:46,820
- I really love those, the felt.

1038
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,134
- That's such a good item.

1039
00:28:48,134 --> 00:28:49,184
- [Kate] That's cute.

1040
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,273
That's even cuter.

1041
00:28:52,273 --> 00:28:53,771
- Okay, so we're about to check out right now from Target

1042
00:28:53,771 --> 00:28:54,800
but I first want to pause

1043
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,670
because look at how good, go, pull back.

1044
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:00,168
Look at how good these carts look together.

1045
00:29:00,168 --> 00:29:03,260
These carts look so chic. - So good.

1046
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,420
This is my favorite thing

1047
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,390
when you start seeing the room come together

1048
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:07,223
- [James] Yes.

1049
00:29:07,223 --> 00:29:08,056
- [Kate] like in the shopping cart.

1050
00:29:08,056 --> 00:29:08,889
- [James] Look how at how good everything looks

1051
00:29:08,889 --> 00:29:09,722
like are you even kidding?

1052
00:29:09,722 --> 00:29:10,555
- Yes.

1053
00:29:10,555 --> 00:29:12,249
We have all the textures, we have the soft,

1054
00:29:12,249 --> 00:29:13,617
we've got the plants,

1055
00:29:13,617 --> 00:29:15,329
we've got the wood elements.

1056
00:29:15,329 --> 00:29:17,840
- This literally looks the best in the entire world.

1057
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,620
Like are you kidding me? - I know, it's amazing.

1058
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,370
- Well Kate, we're really talented.

1059
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:24,436
- Full car-- - Getting there.

1060
00:29:24,436 --> 00:29:25,993
- [Kate] But there's still room for us.

1061
00:29:25,993 --> 00:29:27,194
- (sighs) That was a lot.

1062
00:29:27,194 --> 00:29:28,700

- [James] Hey I told you I'm ready

1071
00:29:44,133 --> 00:29:45,978
for you to go on maternity leave.

1072
00:29:45,978 --> 00:29:46,811
So focused.

1073
00:29:46,811 --> 00:29:47,737
- I know you're already remixing me.

1074
00:29:47,737 --> 00:29:48,570
I'm scared.

1075
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:49,620
You're coming for me.

1076
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,453
- [James] I really am.

1077
00:29:50,453 --> 00:29:53,116
You guys, the new table is literally already here.

1078
00:29:53,116 --> 00:29:55,723
- It's so beautiful!

1079
00:29:55,723 --> 00:29:56,985
- [James] It's so big and beautiful.

1080
00:29:56,985 --> 00:29:58,120
- [Kate] It's also going to be so easy

1081
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,336
to also clean thankfully.

1082
00:29:59,336 --> 00:30:00,671
- [James] Wow this is the most she got

1083
00:30:00,671 --> 00:30:01,697
for this entire room I think.

1084
00:30:01,697 --> 00:30:04,170
- [Kate] Yup. (laughing)

1085
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:06,957
- Wow good morning world and to my luxury bedroom.

1086
00:30:06,957 --> 00:30:08,897
Wow I don't know where I would go.

1087
00:30:08,897 --> 00:30:11,118
Maybe I'll sit on my nice luxury couch

1088
00:30:11,118 --> 00:30:13,296
and watch my luxury television

1089
00:30:13,296 --> 00:30:15,730
and put my luxury feet on my luxury table.

1090
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,340
- [Kate] Okay, so I don't mind the mirror there

1091
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,282
but it would also look amazing right there.

1092
00:30:19,282 --> 00:30:21,328
Pretty!

1093
00:30:21,328 --> 00:30:22,220
- [James] That's a good background.

1094
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,840
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1095
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,516
So good!

1096
00:30:25,516 --> 00:30:27,170
- [Joey] That's a good fake plant.

1097
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:28,690
- Really good fake plant.

1098
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:30,050
A fake agave.

1099
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:31,650
So cute.

1100
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:33,920
And then a taller one over there.

1101
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,870
- Yeah definitely.

1102
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:35,703
Something for the--

1103
00:30:35,703 --> 00:30:38,230
- [Kate] The bird of paradise maybe, right?

1104
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:39,540
- Should we get that too? - Yes.

1105
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,310
I like this birdseye.

1106
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:42,690
- [Drew] Oh look at all those balls.

1107
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:44,055
- [Kate] Decorative Balls!

1108
00:30:44,055 --> 00:30:45,810
My favorite!

1109
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:47,920
- [James] Look how cute, balls!

1110
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:50,130
- [Kate] I know, look at all those decorative balls.

1111
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:52,240
- Our decorative balls.

1112
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,900
- [James] We need a good pot for this.

1113
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:54,733
- [Kate] We need a good pot,

1114
00:30:54,733 --> 00:30:57,042
You also need to flare those out a little bit,

1115
00:30:57,042 --> 00:30:58,670
but you don't want them too flared

1116
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:00,440
that they slap you in the face

1117
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,740
on your way to go pee-pee.

1118
00:31:04,206 --> 00:31:06,789
- Ow! (laughing)

1119
00:31:06,789 --> 00:31:09,544
Can you watch where you're flaring that?

1120
00:31:09,544 --> 00:31:11,224
We should put the concrete balls in here.

1121
00:31:11,224 --> 00:31:12,765
- [Kate] You want to decorative ball room?

1122
00:31:12,765 --> 00:31:14,009
Yes!

1123
00:31:14,009 --> 00:31:15,082
- I don't even know decorative,

1124
00:31:15,082 --> 00:31:17,392
I just love decorative balls.

1125
00:31:17,392 --> 00:31:18,770
I love big round balls.

1126
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:21,027
- [Kate] Yeah, put balls in your room

1127
00:31:21,027 --> 00:31:23,071
and it will summon more balls.

1128
00:31:23,071 --> 00:31:26,030
- Oh, Kate. - Yes, auspicious.

1129
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:26,920
Let's--

1130
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,950
- [Joey] Here's your smaller ball.

1131
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:28,928
- Thank you so much.

1132
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:29,761
- [Kate] Yeah, let's see what the decorative ball

1133
00:31:29,761 --> 00:31:30,594
look like next to it.

1134
00:31:30,594 --> 00:31:32,302
- The decorative balls.

1135
00:31:32,302 --> 00:31:33,550
- [James] Okay, I don't think this should,

1136
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:37,730
this doesn't look good here, the big pot.

1137
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:38,630
- It's too tall. - It's too tall.

1138
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,410
- Okay ready for this design magic

1139
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:41,304
that's about to happen right in your eye.

1140
00:31:41,304 --> 00:31:43,480
- [Kate] Can you grab, sorry a million another thing,

1141
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:47,368
there should be some Target, maybe...

1142
00:31:47,368 --> 00:31:48,939
- [Joey] That was good James.

1143
00:31:48,939 --> 00:31:50,780
- Is that better? - Yeah.

1144
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:51,613
- [Kate] Yes!

1145
00:31:51,613 --> 00:31:53,080
- Okay and that goes here and then we put--

1146
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,265
- [Kate] A decorative ball.

1147
00:31:54,265 --> 00:31:56,848
- [James] This bowl right here.

1148
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,653
- What if you do the bigger grey one too?

1149
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:05,580
I like that better because it look more random

1150
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:07,963
and sometimes you just have to throw stuff.

1151
00:32:07,963 --> 00:32:08,796
Hello sisters! - Hey guys.

1152
00:32:08,796 --> 00:32:11,540
- We are back at Jame's house today.

1153
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,960
Jame's is out at a bunch of meetings today

1154
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,630
but we are here to pull more stuff together.

1155
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:20,570
We just got this new rug down in the living room.

1156
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:22,000
- It's glorious - It's beautiful.

1157
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,950
So we have so much to do.

1158
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:25,271
We've got signs being delivered today.

1159
00:32:25,271 --> 00:32:27,890
We've got so many things to hang on the walls.

1160
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:28,870
Let's do it. - Here we go.

1161
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:31,000
So we got this awesome rug in.

1162
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,570
- This is a great rug.

1163
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:34,800
The rug that was in here before was too small

1164
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,154
for the scale of the sofa.

1165
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:37,680
So now we've got a rug

1166
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:40,110
that actually the matches the size of the sofa

1167
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,570
and the size of the room.

1168
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:43,250
Just makes it that much more established

1169
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:44,700
and it's also a natural fiber.

1170
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,440
And then we're gonna get the coffee table,

1171
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,410
the glass and the concrete coffee table in here

1172
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:49,370
which is going to be so pretty.

1173
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:50,757
- [Joey] Wait, since James isn't here

1174
00:32:50,757 --> 00:32:52,620
do you think he'll mind if we rug cuddle

1175
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,765
on his rug?

1176
00:32:53,765 --> 00:32:54,947
- Ah!

1177
00:32:54,947 --> 00:32:56,083
- The rug is great,

1178
00:32:58,083 --> 00:32:58,916
is blessed

1179
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:01,650
with our love.

1180
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:04,820
- Alright we have this entryway mirror

1181
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:07,710
now up right by the front door.

1182
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:10,437
Look how beautiful, because hello.

1183
00:33:10,437 --> 00:33:13,504
James definitely needs a mirror

1184
00:33:13,504 --> 00:33:16,750
to check his

1185
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:19,240
snatched self before he leaves.

1186
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,690
Update in the office.

1187
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:24,800
The shelves have gone up now over the desk

1188
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,212
which is going to just make it functional

1189
00:33:27,212 --> 00:33:28,950
and beautiful over here.

1190
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:32,210
We can display things like, oh I don't know,

1191
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:36,180
James' People's Choice Award.

1192
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:39,627
Should that be the first thing that goes on the shelf?

1193
00:33:39,627 --> 00:33:42,530
♪ It fits ♪

1194
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:44,020
I'm just bringing in some accessories,

1195
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:47,060
of course I'm going to final style with James

1196
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,400
when he gets back,

1197
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,530
but I'm just kind of bringing

1198
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:51,510
in some items that we would style

1199
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:52,610
on these office shelves

1200
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:54,860
because they're a little bit more utilitarian.

1201
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:58,650
And then this amazing lamp, which we couldn't resist.

1202
00:33:58,650 --> 00:33:59,900
The neon sign is going to go here.

1203
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,800
He's going to have a whole new editing setup here,

1204
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,930
but the office is coming together.

1205
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:06,414
Oh let's bring in the stools too.

1206
00:34:06,414 --> 00:34:08,997
(upbeat music)

1207
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:15,950
- Oh--

1208
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:17,801
- [Kate] Oh my God

1209
00:34:17,801 --> 00:34:18,801
- [James] Holy crap.

1210
00:34:21,174 --> 00:34:23,350
- [Kate and James] That looks so good!

1211
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:24,988
- [Kate] Oh my gosh it's in there!

1212
00:34:24,988 --> 00:34:27,020
They mounted that beautifully.

1213
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,585
What with like glue or something?

1214
00:34:28,585 --> 00:34:29,418
- [Joey] Yeah I don't even know.

1215
00:34:29,418 --> 00:34:30,641
- I love when we mount YouTube's plaques

1216
00:34:30,641 --> 00:34:31,620
better than YouTube does.

1217
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,533
- [Kate] Yeah YouTube, take some cues.

1218
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:36,846
- My picture looks so good there.

1219
00:34:36,846 --> 00:34:38,737
Look-- - Let's just pause .

1220
00:34:38,737 --> 00:34:40,400
- Look at what you people-- - Look how good this looks.

1221
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,063
- You people are standing here, holding it.

1222
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,420
- [Joey] No it does, it looks so good.

1223
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,490
- Kind of fun.

1224
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:48,534
Backstory, we took a picture that I took

1225
00:34:48,534 --> 00:34:50,930
on my Africa trip were my favorite weeks

1226
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:51,850
of my entire life

1227
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:53,141
and Kate wanted to frame it for the middle

1228
00:34:53,141 --> 00:34:54,464
which I love the idea.

1229
00:34:54,464 --> 00:34:56,461
- Well yeah I mean-- - It's great.

1230
00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:57,294
- [Kate] I love the idea

1231
00:34:57,294 --> 00:34:58,280
of the black and white photography

1232
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,450
breaking up the text art.

1233
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:01,598
- [Joey] Yeah, that's chic.

1234
00:35:01,598 --> 00:35:03,305
- That looks the best. - That looks good and fresh.

1235
00:35:03,305 --> 00:35:04,138
- Yeah, I think it makes the most sense.

1236
00:35:04,138 --> 00:35:04,980
- Yeah, I like that.

1237
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,763
- And look, we're ending it right there--

1238
00:35:06,763 --> 00:35:08,660
- Right at the end there. - At the end of the beam.

1239
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:09,820
- Uh-huh. - Perfect.

1240
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:12,060
- Shall we right now standing in the Sister Studio

1241
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,640
where I film all my videos all day long,

1242
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,473
every single day

1243
00:35:14,473 --> 00:35:15,940
and like what we were talking about,

1244
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,710
we needed to add a few extra fun things

1245
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,602
to make it feel like a full production space.

1246
00:35:19,602 --> 00:35:21,247
- Legit. - So got to have some sign.

1247
00:35:21,247 --> 00:35:23,210
- Yes, it's going to be-- - Wanna see it?

1248
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:24,043
- Yeah I wanna see it!

1249
00:35:24,043 --> 00:35:25,296
- A custom sign that James' designed.

1250
00:35:25,296 --> 00:35:26,129
- I did. - Yes.

1251
00:35:26,129 --> 00:35:27,638
I haven't seen it though. - I know.

1252
00:35:27,638 --> 00:35:29,441
(shrieking)

1253
00:35:29,441 --> 00:35:31,274
This is a real friend.

1254
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:34,433
- Oh my God, that looks so good!

1255
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:38,314
- It looks so good! - Oh my God!

1256
00:35:38,314 --> 00:35:40,983
- Oh my God, I'm obsessed with these splatters.

1257
00:35:40,983 --> 00:35:43,550
- That literally, turn around.

1258
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:46,476
Oh my god.

1259
00:35:46,476 --> 00:35:47,309
Wow!

1260
00:35:47,309 --> 00:35:48,400
- Will you go stand by it James?

1261
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,233
Go stand by it.

1262
00:35:50,729 --> 00:35:52,012
Oh my God!

1263
00:35:52,012 --> 00:35:52,845
- [Joey] There's going to be a lot

1264
00:35:52,845 --> 00:35:54,490
of studio selfies in the,

1265
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:56,800
like whenever you have guests come over,

1266
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,860
you have them take a selfie in front of that.

1267
00:35:58,860 --> 00:35:59,693
- [Kate] Oh yeah.

1268
00:35:59,693 --> 00:36:01,850
- [James] On the acrylic and the trace too.

1269
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:03,870
Wow, that's so dope.

1270
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,130
- [Joey] Good job team.

1271
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:06,030
- [Kate] Yay team!

1272
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:07,963
- Hello Sisters!

1273
00:36:07,963 --> 00:36:10,700
It is late afternoon because this morning,

1274
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:11,990
Kate and Joey did their reveal

1275
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:13,860
to me for their room and spoiler alert,

1276
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,430
it looks absolutely amazing.

1277
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:16,640
You guys have to check it out on their channel

1278
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,116
but-- - Hopefully you like it.

1279
00:36:18,116 --> 00:36:19,427
- It's literally the best

1280
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,047
but now their crew is on the way out

1281
00:36:21,047 --> 00:36:22,610
and we have the house to ourselves again.

1282
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:23,976
First time in a while, - Yeah.

1283
00:36:23,976 --> 00:36:26,020
- And obviously we have the entire rest

1284
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,020
of the house to decorate.

1285
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,204
So-- - But the fun stuff.

1286
00:36:28,204 --> 00:36:29,504
- But also fun stuff so,

1287
00:36:29,504 --> 00:36:31,698
we have all this decor bits and bobs

1288
00:36:31,698 --> 00:36:33,820
in front of us that we picked out at Target

1289
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:34,673
and saved to all the places

1290
00:36:34,673 --> 00:36:36,450
that you guys saw us Sisters shopping at.

1291
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:40,890
So we figured we would show you guys how we want to style--

1292
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:42,184
- The shelves. - The entire house.

1293
00:36:42,184 --> 00:36:43,017
At the start of this,

1294
00:36:43,017 --> 00:36:44,810
we had 873 items

1295
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:46,200
in our car approximately. - Yeah.

1296
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,140
- And now looking at the table,

1297
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,523
we have like 12.

1298
00:36:48,523 --> 00:36:50,500
So slightly concerned.

1299
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,800
- [Joey] We also brought some things

1300
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,900
up to the landing already.

1301
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,540
- Yeah, we brought some stuff up there already.

1302
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,201
We have the boxes to fill in space.

1303
00:36:56,201 --> 00:36:58,650
We we're going to get some coffee table books

1304
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:00,103
but that sort of halfway happened.

1305
00:37:00,103 --> 00:37:01,757
We got it for the coffee table

1306
00:37:01,757 --> 00:37:03,520
but we don't really have any shelf books.

1307
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,353
- Yeah.

1308
00:37:04,353 --> 00:37:05,530
- [Joey] Which room are we trying to decorate right now?

1309
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:06,918
- Let's start this one. - Yeah.

1310
00:37:06,918 --> 00:37:08,110
- Let's just knock it out.

1311
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:09,220
- Love it! - Let's go bottom out.

1312
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,290
- Okay, I'm ready.

1313
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:12,383
Do you want that in here?

1314
00:37:12,383 --> 00:37:15,490
As a layered moment or over the beanbag?

1315
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:19,410
What if you put sheepskin over the sack bag

1316
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:20,243
or whatever you call it?

1317
00:37:20,243 --> 00:37:21,475
- [James] Do you feel it with clash with the carpet?

1318
00:37:21,475 --> 00:37:23,949
Oh let's talk about the carpet!

1319
00:37:23,949 --> 00:37:26,100
- (laughing) Let's!

1320
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,303
Sister standoff.

1321
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:30,950
- I am not loving this carpet right now

1322
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:32,281
that we have underneath our feet

1323
00:37:32,281 --> 00:37:34,754
and the new one-- - The new one.

1324
00:37:34,754 --> 00:37:36,260
- The jute carpet.

1325
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,560
- [Joey] What is there not to love about it?

1326
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,990
- [James] Its, I think it's too yellow.

1327
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:43,194
- Okay, here's my thing, okay?

1328
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:45,050
- [Joey] It's natural, it's natural white.

1329
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:47,120
- It's natural fiber.

1330
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,810
You wanted the layered colors,

1331
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:49,780
the layered tones. - Yes.

1332
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:51,300
- Right, going with minimalist design

1333
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,140
you have to layer different tones

1334
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,100
to create complexity

1335
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:57,110
because you don't have wham-bam contrast going on.

1336
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:57,943
- This is true.

1337
00:37:57,943 --> 00:37:59,930
- It's also been the rainiest week ever

1338
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:01,741
in L.A. history. - It's true.

1339
00:38:01,741 --> 00:38:04,610
- Don't quote me on that but it's been really dim outside

1340
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:07,570
so you had the yellowy lights on it all the time.

1341
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:09,220
You literally haven't seen it in

1342
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,150
full on daylight.

1343
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,970
- [Joey] Yea or nay carpet?

1344
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:12,950
- Nay.

1345
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:13,783
- Yea or nay? - Yea.

1346
00:38:13,783 --> 00:38:15,892
- Yea or nay? - Yea.

1347
00:38:15,892 --> 00:38:17,796
- Yea or nay? - Yea.

1348
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:19,763
(cheering) - Yea.

1349
00:38:19,763 --> 00:38:21,006
- I feel attacked.

1350
00:38:21,006 --> 00:38:22,153
- People do this.

1351
00:38:22,153 --> 00:38:24,780
They buy big items

1352
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,820
before they finish the rest of their place.

1353
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:29,140
They become fixated on that item.

1354
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,240
They change it out-- - Smart.

1355
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,390
- They return it and then they just become hung up

1356
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:35,650
and three years later they haven't decorated their room

1357
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:37,120
because they haven't found the right rug.

1358
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,760
Whereas, let's live with this.

1359
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,397
Let's get the rest of the room put together.

1360
00:38:40,397 --> 00:38:41,980
Let the sun shine

1361
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,173
and then call me.

1362
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,000
- I'm going to give the benefit of the doubt

1363
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,901
because I trust you. - I know, I know.

1364
00:38:46,901 --> 00:38:49,790
- And your opinion is very good, not wanting it right now.

1365
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:51,720
- I totally feel you.

1366
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,538
It's a good life lesson. (laughs)

1367
00:38:54,538 --> 00:38:55,915
- Likely this isn't part of the initial shown

1368
00:38:55,915 --> 00:38:57,480
in the video because in the designer process,

1369
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,002
not everything always works perfectly.

1370
00:38:59,002 --> 00:38:59,835
- No.

1371
00:38:59,835 --> 00:39:00,668
- Like there always needs to go wrong.

1372
00:39:00,668 --> 00:39:01,501
Sometimes you pick things

1373
00:39:01,501 --> 00:39:02,334
and then they look good online,

1374
00:39:02,334 --> 00:39:03,390
they don't come the same way.

1375
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:06,450
Me, before I put FaceTune on Instagram.

1376
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:08,060
It's just like, sometimes you need to switch it up

1377
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,980
or wait until the end and see what it looks like.

1378
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,395
- I feel like that should be in here,

1379
00:39:11,395 --> 00:39:13,150
once we move the folding table.

1380
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:13,983
This is the room

1381
00:39:13,983 --> 00:39:15,720
where you most readily wire throw blankets

1382
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,059
available, right? - Yes definitely.

1383
00:39:17,059 --> 00:39:19,160
- And we got so many great options.

1384
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,753
We've got this kind of one-- - That's a good one.

1385
00:39:21,753 --> 00:39:24,810
- This is good for look, don't cuddle.

1386
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:26,816
- Yeah nobody's ever going to cuddle with that.

1387
00:39:26,816 --> 00:39:27,680
- This one will be the one

1388
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,890
that's permanently on this ladder.

1389
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:29,723
- Okay.

1390
00:39:29,723 --> 00:39:31,976
- The rest of the will be rotating.

1391
00:39:31,976 --> 00:39:33,530
- I feel like we should put this marble chain

1392
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:34,700
underneath the TV.

1393
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,587
- Yeah, I'm trying to clean.

1394
00:39:39,193 --> 00:39:40,610
What we need is,

1395
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:43,860
we need a box for it to drape on

1396
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:45,970
so you can see the movement of it.

1397
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:47,340
Exactly, great. - Beautiful.

1398
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:50,923
- Two of our four books are already stylish.

1399
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,530
- [Drew] Do you think it's too much marble options?

1400
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:56,140
- [James] Yeah, we need some other color pops

1401
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:56,973
to offset it.

1402
00:39:56,973 --> 00:39:58,958
- So maybe layer it with this guy.

1403
00:39:58,958 --> 00:39:59,863
- [Drew] How's this?

1404
00:39:59,863 --> 00:40:01,257
- I mean that's cute there but now--

1405
00:40:01,257 --> 00:40:02,090
- This.

1406
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:03,080
- [James] Drew, did you just take this

1407
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:03,923
out of my centerpiece.

1408
00:40:03,923 --> 00:40:06,796
- [Drew] Yeah I did but it's still full.

1409
00:40:06,796 --> 00:40:07,629
- [James] Drew!

1410
00:40:07,629 --> 00:40:08,948
- [Kate] Okay James, here's options.

1411
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:10,710
Plant? - Yes.

1412
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:15,126
- Or sculpture?

1413
00:40:15,126 --> 00:40:17,123
- Oh that's kind of good. - Right?

1414
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:18,970
Because we'll have a lot of plants going on

1415
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:19,803
in the shelves.

1416
00:40:19,803 --> 00:40:21,511
- I just want to say this doesn't even look good.

1417
00:40:21,511 --> 00:40:23,560
- [Joey] We're not even on that room right now.

1418
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,622
- Joey!

1419
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:26,280
- [Joey] Come back.

1420
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,290
- Hmm that mirror look not good there.

1421
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:29,123
- [Kate] No?

1422
00:40:29,123 --> 00:40:29,956
- Yeah it does.

1423
00:40:29,956 --> 00:40:30,848
No.

1424
00:40:30,848 --> 00:40:33,098
(laughing)

1425
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:36,840
Yeah looks nice, maybe something at the end.

1426
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,340
To literally encompass it all.

1427
00:40:39,575 --> 00:40:41,520
- [Kate] What about this little dripper?

1428
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,290
- [James] Oh yeah, I love a little dripper.

1429
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:45,900
- Like if we have a little dripper coming

1430
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,590
plain with the...

1431
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:51,303
Let this not be so straight. - Perfect.

1432
00:40:52,314 --> 00:40:53,147
- Perfect.

1433
00:40:53,147 --> 00:40:55,080
- [Drew] No you have to put it on this shelf James.

1434
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,350
To make it look like you water it,

1435
00:40:57,350 --> 00:40:59,037
because you can't water it up there.

1436
00:40:59,037 --> 00:41:00,500
- [Joey] No one will believe it's real.

1437
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,443
That's a good tip.

1438
00:41:02,584 --> 00:41:03,417
- That is good to know.

1439
00:41:03,417 --> 00:41:05,987
- I would never think that deep about it.

1440
00:41:05,987 --> 00:41:07,061
- You should probably quit your job then.

1441
00:41:07,061 --> 00:41:08,186
- Yeah.

1442
00:41:08,186 --> 00:41:11,240
James what do you think about a frame,

1443
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,050
resting frame moment.

1444
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:14,590
- [James] I love the resting frame moment.

1445
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:15,423
- Okay.

1446
00:41:15,423 --> 00:41:16,750
Do you want him still over there?

1447
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:18,218
Because obviously he has been living over there.

1448
00:41:18,218 --> 00:41:19,653
Do you want to change him up? - Let's switch him up.

1449
00:41:20,626 --> 00:41:23,170
I think we need something actually tall here, though.

1450
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:26,230
To balance out because it likes tall, short, short, tall.

1451
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:27,663
- [Joey] Well, what was wrong with that?

1452
00:41:27,663 --> 00:41:29,730
- Hmm. - Too tall.

1453
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:30,563
- Kind of ugly.

1454
00:41:30,563 --> 00:41:31,742
- It looks-- - Not ugly, but I feel like-

1455
00:41:31,742 --> 00:41:33,010
- [Joey] Doesn't fit.

1456
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:34,310
- [Drew] Oh you probably meant a decorative ball.

1457
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:36,686
- Decorative ball. - Did you try the ball?

1458
00:41:36,686 --> 00:41:37,863
- [James] I was thinking about it.

1459
00:41:37,863 --> 00:41:39,366
- Try it!

1460
00:41:39,366 --> 00:41:40,800
- [Drew] That looks nice.

1461
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,960
- [James] It's actually kind of good.

1462
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:42,922
- [Drew] Very curvy.

1463
00:41:42,922 --> 00:41:43,980
- I think its good

1464
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:46,294
and I also kind of love the bookend.

1465
00:41:46,294 --> 00:41:49,503
The subtle bookend of the silver sculpture.

1466
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,540
It's like this is-- - I like this too.

1467
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:55,758
- A magnified version of that.

1468
00:41:55,758 --> 00:41:57,183
Okay, I'm taking the price tags off

1469
00:41:57,183 --> 00:41:58,663
because we loved it.

1470
00:41:59,967 --> 00:42:01,630
♪ It ain't about the money, money, money ♪

1471
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:04,072
♪ Unless it's coffee, coffee, coffee, table books ♪

1472
00:42:04,072 --> 00:42:07,046
(laughing)

1473
00:42:07,046 --> 00:42:11,337
- Oh wow Kate, you are getting brave tonight.

1474
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:13,280
- [Drew] Look how chic that it.

1475
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,333
Two boxes for the price of one.

1476
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:16,166
- Whoa, Whoa, Whoa.

1477
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:17,460
You're going to use all four

1478
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:19,623
of the remaining books? - All four.

1479
00:42:21,203 --> 00:42:22,553
- [Drew] It actually looks good.

1480
00:42:22,553 --> 00:42:23,701
- It looks good but we don't have any more

1481
00:42:23,701 --> 00:42:26,140
for any of the other shelves now.

1482
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:27,810
- [Drew] Oh well, this is a main room.

1483
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:29,785
- [Kate] I think we need a candle on it,

1484
00:42:29,785 --> 00:42:31,418
we need a candle on it. - Oh, Please.

1485
00:42:31,418 --> 00:42:32,251
- That looks so good.

1486
00:42:32,251 --> 00:42:35,168
- [Drew] That's a nice aged, mercury glass bitten bottle.

1487
00:42:35,168 --> 00:42:36,207
- Isn't that so good?

1488
00:42:36,207 --> 00:42:37,275
I found it at Target on sale,

1489
00:42:37,275 --> 00:42:39,034
"I think we're purchasing this right now."

1490
00:42:39,034 --> 00:42:42,250
- [Kate] Since we don't have the big, beefy glass tray,

1491
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:44,320
maybe we use the mirror tray here?

1492
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,602
Or do you like it-- - I don't like--

1493
00:42:45,602 --> 00:42:46,583
- Clothing.

1494
00:42:46,583 --> 00:42:49,244
- Well I feel like those two vases are the same height,

1495
00:42:49,244 --> 00:42:50,801
so that needs to change.

1496
00:42:50,801 --> 00:42:52,253
This is so hard.

1497
00:42:54,930 --> 00:42:56,830
- [Joey] I think you should take away the lantern

1498
00:42:56,830 --> 00:42:57,710
and the white vase.

1499
00:42:57,710 --> 00:42:59,850
Just leave the cool vase and the plants.

1500
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:01,093
- No. - No.

1501
00:43:01,093 --> 00:43:02,206
- [Drew] That's illegal.

1502
00:43:02,206 --> 00:43:03,039
- Just take the watering can away.

1503
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:06,200
- [Joey] No the watering can is the best piece.

1504
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,998
- [James] No, the watering can should be on the shelf.

1505
00:43:07,998 --> 00:43:09,110
- [Joey] Okay, fine.

1506
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:11,150
- We need a pot to put this in.

1507
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:11,983
- [Joey] Why?

1508
00:43:11,983 --> 00:43:12,816
It's in a pot?

1509
00:43:12,816 --> 00:43:13,649
- It kind of looks chic in that pot.

1510
00:43:13,649 --> 00:43:16,292
- Yeah. - Yeah I like that chic pot.

1511
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,110
- [Joey] Perfect.

1512
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:20,353
- Some little stubs.

1513
00:43:21,189 --> 00:43:22,625
- I think that can go up, up.

1514
00:43:22,625 --> 00:43:24,801
- [James] Yeah, up up up and away.

1515
00:43:24,801 --> 00:43:27,020
- Joey can you do it? - Mmhm.

1516
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:28,170
- [Drew] That's a nice bold spot.

1517
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:29,610
- Yeah, that is good.

1518
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:31,560
Wait give me the small, Joey, give me the small one.

1519
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:34,911
- [Kate] No yeah, that pot is thick

1520
00:43:34,911 --> 00:43:37,410
It's got a thick booty on it.

1521
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:38,470
- [James] That's good.

1522
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:39,685
- [Kate] Yeah, we like that there.

1523
00:43:39,685 --> 00:43:42,463
- What about all the way at the top, this vase?

1524
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:45,831
With the light shining on it for glass floridity?

1525
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:47,630
- So will we find a rainbow when the light hits it?

1526
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:49,794
- Yeah. - Let's try that.

1527
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:50,757
- We're going to need a step stool

1528
00:43:50,757 --> 00:43:52,220
to put that up there.

1529
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:53,129
- [Drew] I'll just throw it.

1530
00:43:53,129 --> 00:43:55,669
(laughing)

1531
00:43:55,669 --> 00:43:56,669
- [All] Ooh.

1532
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:00,650
- Inspired moment.

1533
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:02,333
- [James] That's luxurious and ratch.

1534
00:44:02,333 --> 00:44:03,380
- Yes.

1535
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:04,969
- We have lots to do still.

1536
00:44:04,969 --> 00:44:08,320
- He sounds really-- - But guess what?

1537
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:11,450
We get to do it all over again.

1538
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:13,480
Here's your accessory table!

1539
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:14,430
- [James] Oh my god.

1540
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:15,400
It looks like it filled back up.

1541
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:17,340
- [Kate] It does look like you have a lot now.

1542
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:18,983
- Wow, you should leave that bowl there.

1543
00:44:18,983 --> 00:44:20,463
That looks so good.

1544
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,193
- [Joey] Why did we set this up down here

1545
00:44:22,193 --> 00:44:24,719
when we got to go upstairs?

1546
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:27,762
- Joey, always looking-- - That's what I was wondering.

1547
00:44:27,762 --> 00:44:29,723
- [Joey] Do you think I always look at the negative?

1548
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:32,133
Is this stupid?

1549
00:44:32,133 --> 00:44:34,640
Should we repo all this stuff upstairs?

1550
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,330
- Yeah. - Yeah?

1551
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:37,307
All right, here we go.

1552
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:39,420
We get to do it again.

1553
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:41,912
- Every place we put the accessories it looks good.

1554
00:44:41,912 --> 00:44:43,660
- [Drew] Look at this door.

1555
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:45,684
- Okay, get excited.

1556
00:44:45,684 --> 00:44:47,070
James!

1557
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:48,510
- Can I do the desk area

1558
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:50,730
and you guys can do the other ones?

1559
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:51,589
- Sure. - Okay.

1560
00:44:51,589 --> 00:44:53,550
- [Joey] So just this is all we got to do

1561
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:54,950
and we're done?

1562
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:56,440
- Yay!

1563
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:57,490
That's baby.

1564
00:44:57,490 --> 00:45:01,413
Do you want the globe for the top of the piano?

1565
00:45:02,437 --> 00:45:04,470
- No. - Or do you want it here?

1566
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:05,960
- [Joey] I don't think you want it on the piano?

1567
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:06,990
- [Drew] I don't think Sisters candles.

1568
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:08,190
- Yeah candles. - Yeah.

1569
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:12,570
- [Drew] No idea.

1570
00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:14,640
Wow this Tom Ford book is so very chic.

1571
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:15,933
- It's the chicest of the chic.

1572
00:45:17,373 --> 00:45:18,423
- Over there. - Yes.

1573
00:45:20,723 --> 00:45:22,230
- [Kate and James] Bam!

1574
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:23,910
- [Joey] I don't think you need anything else on the piano.

1575
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:24,900
- No I agree.

1576
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:27,140
Maybe put it by the little side table?

1577
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:28,877
- Just a floor sitter?

1578
00:45:28,877 --> 00:45:29,710
- [Drew] A floor sitter option.

1579
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:31,660
- I think we should put the table over here

1580
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:33,660
and instead put the large sculpture maybe here.

1581
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:35,155
Or switch it?

1582
00:45:35,155 --> 00:45:36,478
- [Kate] I don't think Joey's loves it.

1583
00:45:36,478 --> 00:45:37,311
- [Joey] When you walk up the stairs

1584
00:45:37,311 --> 00:45:39,130
and see the wire sculpture, it's amazing.

1585
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:40,717
- But that mirror's for our own TV.

1586
00:45:40,717 --> 00:45:41,850
- [Joey] Oh that's true.

1587
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:43,180
So you want it in the pics.

1588
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:44,380
Yeah, well it's going to be better

1589
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:46,665
than that table for your pictures.

1590
00:45:46,665 --> 00:45:48,195
- So true.

1591
00:45:48,195 --> 00:45:51,210
- [Kate] Does that fit up here?

1592
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:53,070
- [Joey] So are we good?

1593
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:54,270
- I think we're good

1594
00:45:54,270 --> 00:45:58,020
and moral of the story is we got enough stuff.

1595
00:45:58,020 --> 00:45:59,579
- Yeah we did.

1596
00:45:59,579 --> 00:46:02,458
- Could have done with the coffee table book or two but...

1597
00:46:02,458 --> 00:46:03,860
(laughing)

1598
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:05,760
- [Joey] Alright guys.

1599
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,600
Did we do it? - Are we done?

1600
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,110
- Think we're done. - I think we're done.

1601
00:46:09,110 --> 00:46:10,144
- I can't believe it.

1602
00:46:10,144 --> 00:46:12,010
- Sisters. - Sisters.

1603
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:14,080
Is it sleeping time?

1604
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:14,913
Oh my god, we're such sleepy sisters.

1605
00:46:14,913 --> 00:46:15,967
- I'm supportive.

1606
00:46:15,967 --> 00:46:17,450
It's been four days

1607
00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:19,770
and we've had literally the time of our life

1608
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:20,603
and we just finished literally

1609
00:46:20,603 --> 00:46:22,740
the most beautiful house in the entire world.

1610
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:23,573
- I agree.

1611
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:25,593
Yes!

1612
00:46:25,593 --> 00:46:27,093
- Ah, daddy Joey.

1613
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:28,893
Should we head to the beauty studio

1614
00:46:28,893 --> 00:46:29,830
to say goodbye?

1615
00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:32,660
- Yes, I'll go in the room and say goodbye.

1616
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:33,493
- That's so true.

1617
00:46:33,493 --> 00:46:35,310
- But I'm so glad that it's done.

1618
00:46:35,310 --> 00:46:36,550
- Okay, so let's do it.

1619
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:37,850
- Let's go. - Alright.

1620
00:46:37,850 --> 00:46:39,520
- Oh my God you guys!

1621
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,280
We are done. - Done.

1622
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,113
I really am going to miss you.

1623
00:46:42,113 --> 00:46:45,120
I've gotten so, I mean I was already obsessed with you

1624
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:46,474
but now I'm attached to you.

1625
00:46:46,474 --> 00:46:47,307
- Same sister.

1626
00:46:47,307 --> 00:46:48,640
I feel like literally this collab

1627
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:51,090
has been in the works for so long now

1628
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:53,310
and I've been subscribed to you guys for so long

1629
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:54,543
and this just meant so much with you

1630
00:46:54,543 --> 00:46:56,520
that you wanted to come over and work together

1631
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:57,353
on this project too,

1632
00:46:57,353 --> 00:46:58,186
which was so cool.

1633
00:46:58,186 --> 00:46:59,680
I know that it was something very different for you guys

1634
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:02,020
but I feel like it turned out so good

1635
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:04,410
and I'm just very proud of what we did

1636
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:06,080
and thank you guys for being the best ever

1637
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,680
and for being talented and for helping me out.

1638
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,380
- We're so impressed by you. - Yeah.

1639
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:12,387
- Like you've done so much in such a short amount of time.

1640
00:47:12,387 --> 00:47:13,258
- Aw, thank you guys.

1641
00:47:13,258 --> 00:47:14,710
- We talk about you all the time.

1642
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:16,850
I just love watching your growth

1643
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:18,110
and I'm just so proud of you

1644
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:21,660
and really, truly so happy for you

1645
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:23,470
and so excited to always see what you're doing.

1646
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:24,303
- You guys are my favorite!

1647
00:47:24,303 --> 00:47:25,437
Thank you guys so much.

1648
00:47:25,437 --> 00:47:27,620
You guys are literally the best in the entire world.

1649
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:28,453

1652
00:47:32,010 --> 00:47:34,720
but you guys have not yet seen the finished product;

1653
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:35,900

1654
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:37,775

1656
00:47:40,242 --> 00:47:41,290
The house is done,

1657
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:43,110
so I literally have no excuses now.

1658
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:44,450
So stay tuned this Friday

1659
00:47:44,450 --> 00:47:45,717
and I hope you guys enjoyed this little decorating video

1660
00:47:45,717 --> 00:47:48,470
and got lots of tips from Kate and Joey and I.

1661
00:47:48,470 --> 00:47:49,640
This was so much fun to do

1662
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:50,473
and I know you guys are going

1663
00:47:50,473 --> 00:47:51,347

1665
00:47:52,590 --> 00:47:53,460

We are 13 million sisters

1670
00:48:00,292 --> 00:48:02,371
and I would love to have you join the family.

1671

Click the bell icon so you can get a notification

1672
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:06,810
every time I upload a brand new video.

1673
00:48:06,810 --> 00:48:07,963
Also, like we talked about,

1674
00:48:07,963 --> 00:48:10,285
the front living room was very much covered

1675
00:48:10,285 --> 00:48:13,501
because over on Kate and Joey's channel--

1676
00:48:13,501 --> 00:48:15,260
- [Kate and Joey] We did it!

1677
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:17,340
- We took it from empty to full

1678
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:18,730
we surprised you with a design.

1679
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:20,026
It was the only part of it obviously

1680
00:48:20,026 --> 00:48:23,390
that James didn't have his digits in

1681
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:25,410
and you we were like fully surprised by it.

1682
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:28,840
So yeah, if you want to see James be sister surprised.

1683
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,038
- It's up right now. - It's up.

1684
00:48:30,038 --> 00:48:31,070
Also go subscribe to them.

1685
00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:32,462
Kate and Joey literally have some of the best content

1686
00:48:32,462 --> 00:48:34,424
on the entire YouTube platform, in my opinion.

1687
00:48:34,424 --> 00:48:37,210
I've been subscribed to them for over four years now

1688
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:38,270
and just like they said for me,

1689
00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:39,973
following their growth has been so incredible

1690
00:48:39,973 --> 00:48:41,320
and I'm so proud of that

1691
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,410
and doing this collab was just such a dream come true.

1692
00:48:43,410 --> 00:48:46,240
