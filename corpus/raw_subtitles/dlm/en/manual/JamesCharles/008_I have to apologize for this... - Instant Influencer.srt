James Charles:<i> Previously on "Instant Influencer"...</i>

2
00:00:04,703 --> 00:00:06,773
Hi, sisters. James Charles here,

3
00:00:06,806 --> 00:00:09,542
and today I have something extra special for you.

4
00:00:09,575 --> 00:00:11,644
<i> We started this competition with six artists.</i>

5
00:00:11,677 --> 00:00:13,546
- Hi, James! - Hi.

6
00:00:13,579 --> 00:00:16,549
-<i> There's been drama... </i> - Oh, you're so beautiful!

7
00:00:16,582 --> 00:00:18,084
I was going for that wig.

8
00:00:18,117 --> 00:00:19,385
Whatever. I'm still gonna beat him.

9
00:00:19,418 --> 00:00:21,320
The sauce. I can't.

10
00:00:21,353 --> 00:00:24,757
-<i> ...and struggles. </i> - Paint is not the move.

11
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:27,493
Gabriel: Ten seconds on the clock. I still don't have my wig on.

12
00:00:27,526 --> 00:00:29,328
<i> Some have had triumphant wins...</i>

13
00:00:29,361 --> 00:00:32,231
The winner of today's Compact Challenge is Ashley.

14
00:00:32,264 --> 00:00:34,100
Congratulations.

15
00:00:34,133 --> 00:00:36,302
We're doing a drag show tonight.

16
00:00:36,335 --> 00:00:40,339
You're extraterrestrial look was out of this world.

17
00:00:40,372 --> 00:00:41,808
Two challenges in a row, baby.

18
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:44,510
<i> ...and some have missed the mark.</i>

19
00:00:44,543 --> 00:00:45,812
I'm sorry. I need to breathe before I cry.

20
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:48,181
She looks like a windburned Mrs. Claus.

21
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:49,649
<i> But in the end...</i>

22
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:51,651
The judges and I have decided

23
00:00:51,684 --> 00:00:52,685
that your look was the weakest

24
00:00:52,718 --> 00:00:53,853
and we have to send you home.

25
00:00:53,886 --> 00:00:55,254
<i> ...only one</i>

26
00:00:55,287 --> 00:00:58,725
can become an Instant Influencer.

27
00:01:09,368 --> 00:01:11,704
Good morning, artists.

28
00:01:11,737 --> 00:01:14,507
- All: Good morning. - We have to talk.

29
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:18,544
So, last night, I got a chance to look back

30
00:01:18,577 --> 00:01:21,547
at the footage from last week's episode

31
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,216
and I saw what you guys did.

32
00:01:26,485 --> 00:01:29,689
You all look really confused. You know what you did.

33
00:01:31,657 --> 00:01:33,660
I honestly feel like you all owe me an apology.

34
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:43,369
And scene.

35
00:01:43,402 --> 00:01:45,638
Oh, my God.

36
00:01:45,671 --> 00:01:48,441
- Really got me, James. - Jesus Christ!

37
00:01:48,474 --> 00:01:50,176
( groans )

38
00:01:50,209 --> 00:01:52,712
The blood went away from my extremities.

39
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:54,547
<i> I don't know what was happening.</i>

40
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,748
It was a hot mess,

41
00:01:55,781 --> 00:01:58,251
but he deserves an Oscar for that.

42
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,186
James: Take this from me, because I've had to deal with this.

43
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:02,188
As an influencer, when you grow a following,

44
00:02:02,221 --> 00:02:03,789
you will either say or do something that people

45
00:02:03,822 --> 00:02:05,525
might not like and might not agree with,

46
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:09,462
and eventually you might have to apologize.

47
00:02:09,495 --> 00:02:11,430
So, for today's Compact Challenge,

48
00:02:11,463 --> 00:02:15,168
you guys will be filming your very own apology videos.

49
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:17,637
Oh, my God.

50
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,273
On each of your workstations, you will open up a compact,

51
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:23,576
and I have randomly assigned each one of you a minor scandal.

52
00:02:23,609 --> 00:02:24,744
Okay.

53
00:02:24,777 --> 00:02:26,279
You guys are going to have 15 minutes

54
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:27,947
to run anywhere you want on set

55
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:32,451
and to film a one-minute, no editing, apology video.

56
00:02:32,484 --> 00:02:34,187
I like this.

57
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:38,391
All right, artists. Your time...

58
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:41,661
( voice breaking ) ...starts...

59
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:42,929
( loudly ) ...now!

60
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:45,331
Ha-ha! Good luck!

61
00:02:45,364 --> 00:02:46,832
You can't have a great complexion

62
00:02:46,865 --> 00:02:48,501
because I'm not supposed to be wearing makeup in this.

63
00:02:48,534 --> 00:02:53,173
"Overdoing click bait titles to get views"? What?

64
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:59,679
"Missed your own meet and greet." I look like I just got beat up.

65
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:04,850
"Caught over-editing your photos."

66
00:03:04,883 --> 00:03:06,953
"Filming second apology video to say sorry

67
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:09,756
for putting ads in the first one."

68
00:03:12,324 --> 00:03:14,327
Whew.

69
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,996
- The things I do. - ( laughs )

70
00:03:17,029 --> 00:03:19,232
I can say a million times

71
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:21,801
<i> I'm not in this for the money.</i>

72
00:03:26,605 --> 00:03:27,840
Hey, dreamers.

73
00:03:30,909 --> 00:03:33,713
I'm sorry that I misled you guys.

74
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:35,348
I want you guys to continue

75
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,450
to be honest with me in the future.

76
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:39,885
 I just really want to apologize and I want to change.

77
00:03:39,918 --> 00:03:41,621
( sobbing )

78
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:43,522
I love you guys all so much.

79
00:03:43,555 --> 00:03:44,824
Please just remember that.

80
00:03:48,727 --> 00:03:50,029
It's one take.

81
00:03:50,062 --> 00:03:51,464
I'm gonna sit down and pick which one

82
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:52,999
I think is the best.

83
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:55,601
Allowing those ads to run, that decision that I made,

84
00:03:55,634 --> 00:03:57,536
has shown you guys nothing

85
00:03:57,569 --> 00:03:59,438
but that I am greedy and in this for the money.

86
00:03:59,471 --> 00:04:01,708
Time! Time! Time is up.

87
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,412
Oh, shit.

88
00:04:07,913 --> 00:04:08,948
James: Okay, bring me the phones, everybody.

89
00:04:08,981 --> 00:04:11,017
Let's see what we got.

90
00:04:12,751 --> 00:04:14,553
All right, you guys. Well, I know this challenge

91
00:04:14,586 --> 00:04:16,889
was very short and very stressful,

92
00:04:16,922 --> 00:04:19,025
but filming an apology video is not fun,

93
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:21,727
and sometimes you do have to address things in a timely manner.

94
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,363
All right, let's jump in.

95
00:04:24,763 --> 00:04:26,399
Hey, Dreamers.

96
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,700
I wanted to apologize

97
00:04:27,733 --> 00:04:30,469
for not coming to my meet and greet.

98
00:04:30,502 --> 00:04:32,038
I've been through a scandal in the past couple days...

99
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:34,473
- The lash. - The lash!

100
00:04:34,506 --> 00:04:37,009
The thumbnail was like somebody getting their wig snatched off,

101
00:04:37,042 --> 00:04:38,844
and you guys were really upset

102
00:04:38,877 --> 00:04:41,380
that that clip wasn't in the actual video.

103
00:04:41,413 --> 00:04:44,950
My nose looks so much thinner than it does in real life,

104
00:04:44,983 --> 00:04:47,420
and I-- it's because I have a Squidward nose.

105
00:04:49,021 --> 00:04:52,525
I had a family emergency,

106
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:56,796
and it just was too heavy on my heart for me to come.

107
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:57,997
I'm, like, actually feeling it.

108
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,299
I know, I know.

109
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:03,436
Allowing those ads to run in my previous video

110
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:06,772
is absolutely unacceptable. At this point, all I can do--

111
00:05:06,805 --> 00:05:08,074
James on video: Time! Time.

112
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:09,642
You're like, "No!"

113
00:05:09,675 --> 00:05:11,744
- You can see my heart drop. - James: Yeah.

114
00:05:11,777 --> 00:05:13,646
All right, you guys, well, I am so proud of all of you

115
00:05:13,679 --> 00:05:15,581
for taking these scandals head on.

116
00:05:15,614 --> 00:05:18,718
Hopefully, this will not be training for the future,

117
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:21,454
but if it is, now you know exactly what to do.

118
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:24,623
I'm pretty sure that you would all make it out of these uncancelled and alive.

119
00:05:24,656 --> 00:05:27,626
So, congratulations to you guys.

120
00:05:27,659 --> 00:05:29,929
But two of you guys really impressed me today.

121
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:34,600
Gabriel, your honesty and your message really came across,

122
00:05:34,633 --> 00:05:36,969
and I felt like I was literally watching your apology.

123
00:05:37,002 --> 00:05:40,639
"I'll be at the next meet and greet ready to take a selfie together."

124
00:05:40,672 --> 00:05:44,543
And also Benny. You prepared so well for this challenge.

125
00:05:44,576 --> 00:05:46,812
Ruining your makeup takes a lot of dedication,

126
00:05:46,845 --> 00:05:48,481
and you really took it to the next level,

127
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:49,682
and I'm really looking forward to seeing

128
00:05:49,715 --> 00:05:51,484
what your future photos will look like.

129
00:05:53,452 --> 00:05:54,920
Congratulations, Benny.

130
00:05:54,953 --> 00:05:57,723
you are the winner of today's Compact Challenge.

131
00:05:57,756 --> 00:05:59,492
- Yay! - Which means you are going to  get a major advantage

132
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:00,960
in today's elimination challenge.

133
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:05,598
I won the advantage! I can't believe this.

134
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:09,402
My strategy was be crazy and to make James laugh.

135
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:11,604
Oh, my gosh. I have a win.

136
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:13,472
After today's Compact Challenge,

137
00:06:13,505 --> 00:06:15,007
you guys are probably starting to feel like

138
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,176
- official beauty  influencers, huh? - Yes.

139
00:06:17,209 --> 00:06:20,045
Good, but I want to take it one step further.

140
00:06:20,078 --> 00:06:22,181
In today's elimination challenge,

141
00:06:22,214 --> 00:06:24,016
we're gonna be focusing on one of the most important things

142
00:06:24,049 --> 00:06:27,787
of being an influencer-- collaborations.

143
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,155
Both: Hi, sisters.

144
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:30,689
I'm gonna turn you into a sister skeleton.

145
00:06:30,722 --> 00:06:32,525
Okay, let's do it.

146
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,894
( gasps, laughs )

147
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:37,897
Collab videos are super important because two influencers

148
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,799
get to come together to share ideas,

149
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:42,101
stories, and also their audiences.

150
00:06:42,134 --> 00:06:44,470
And, if done well, it should pay off for both people.

151
00:06:44,503 --> 00:06:46,172
It may seem like collab videos are super easy

152
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:48,874
and just two friends hanging out and filming a video,

153
00:06:48,907 --> 00:06:51,710
but there is so much more that goes into it.

154
00:06:51,743 --> 00:06:53,112
You need to pick a unique concept

155
00:06:53,145 --> 00:06:54,747
that will grab the viewers' attention

156
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,649
while allowing both personalities to shine.

157
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:58,484
To help you artists out with today's challenge,

158
00:06:58,517 --> 00:07:01,554
I want to invite in some of my friends.

159
00:07:03,155 --> 00:07:07,092
- Hey, guys. - ( screaming )

160
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:09,228
-<i> Hola, hola. </i> - Hi!

161
00:07:09,261 --> 00:07:12,064
- James: Hello, hello. - Hi!

162
00:07:12,097 --> 00:07:13,766
- Hi, guys. - Hello, you guys.

163
00:07:13,799 --> 00:07:15,568
Thank you all so much for joining me today.

164
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,970
As I'm sure you guys know, but just to remind you,

165
00:07:18,003 --> 00:07:20,440
we have Nikita Dragun, trans icon.

166
00:07:22,574 --> 00:07:23,909
Da baddest, Bretman Rock.

167
00:07:23,942 --> 00:07:26,846
Hi, guys.

168
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,049
- The Latina, Louie. - ( clicks tongue )

169
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:32,017
And also advocate for inclusivity, Nyma Tang.

170
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:34,220
Hi.

171
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:35,754
As I'm sure you guys have guessed,

172
00:07:35,787 --> 00:07:37,223
you guys will be filming collaboration videos

173
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:39,091
with our influencers here today.

174
00:07:39,124 --> 00:07:41,760
And, Benny, as the winner of today's compact challenge,

175
00:07:41,793 --> 00:07:44,964
your advantage, you get your first pick of who you want to film with,

176
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:49,101
and then you also get to assign your fellow artists to their influencer.

177
00:07:49,134 --> 00:07:50,936
Oh, my God.

178
00:07:50,969 --> 00:07:54,139
- Oh, my God. - Choose very wisely.

179
00:07:54,172 --> 00:07:56,108
These guest collaborators are huge,

180
00:07:56,141 --> 00:07:57,776
<i> and I know who I'm gonna pick.</i>

181
00:07:57,809 --> 00:08:00,880
Benny, who do you want to film your collab with?

182
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:03,916
- I choose Bretman. - ( gasps ) Oh, my God.

183
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:06,652
Benny and Bretty!

184
00:08:06,685 --> 00:08:10,523
I've been watching him for years.

185
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:11,824
Who do you want to pair up next?

186
00:08:11,857 --> 00:08:14,226
Okay, I think I'm gonna go...

187
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:16,262
- Gabriel with Nyma. - Hi.

188
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:18,297
James: Okay. Come on down.

189
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:22,101
- Hi. - Nikita with Ashley.

190
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:24,937
- Okay. - Hi.

191
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:26,205
We have the same shoes, so--

192
00:08:26,238 --> 00:08:27,940
- Oh! - Ashley: Watch out!

193
00:08:27,973 --> 00:08:30,910
And then finally that leaves Louie with Kailin.

194
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:32,745
- Come here. - We have the same jacket.

195
00:08:32,778 --> 00:08:34,647
Yes. Oh, my God, yes.

196
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,015
Now that you guys are all paired up,

197
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:38,817
artists, you are going to have three hours

198
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:41,887
to film and edit a collaboration video

199
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,656
with your influencers.

200
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,624
They'll be three to five minutes long,

201
00:08:45,657 --> 00:08:47,159
and remember to keep them fun, unique,

202
00:08:47,192 --> 00:08:50,296
and most importantly, very, very entertaining.

203
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:52,798
Remember, this is the last challenge

204
00:08:52,831 --> 00:08:54,733
before the finals next week.

205
00:08:54,766 --> 00:08:56,936
$50,000 is on the line.

206
00:08:56,969 --> 00:08:58,637
And while we're on the topic of collaboration,

207
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,839
of course, a collaboration with me, yours truly.

208
00:09:00,872 --> 00:09:04,910
So remember to blend, but don't blend in.

209
00:09:04,943 --> 00:09:07,179
- ( gasps ) - Three hours until upload time.

210
00:09:07,212 --> 00:09:10,149
Your time starts now.

211
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:12,318
- Okay, where are we going? - Let's go.

212
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:14,320
Let's go, Benny.

213
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:16,655
Like, literally I've been following you since 2014.

214
00:09:16,688 --> 00:09:20,960
And, um, I just decided to get into makeup because of you and James.

215
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:23,596
- Oh, my God, that's so sweet. - And that's why I picked you.

216
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:25,698
Okay, so what are you vibing? Like, tell me everything.

217
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,067
Honestly, like, I feel like we have this really common

218
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,203
- just, like, bad bitch vibe. - Yeah.

219
00:09:31,236 --> 00:09:33,038
And as I've been in this competition, they've kind of been like,

220
00:09:33,071 --> 00:09:34,773
"You don't seem vulnerable,"

221
00:09:34,806 --> 00:09:36,342
like, that I don't really show my emotions.

222
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,077
So what I think we should do

223
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,312
is really get down to the core of why we are the way we are.

224
00:09:40,345 --> 00:09:43,182
- Yeah. - Like, my followers beg me  for teen mom stories.

225
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:46,285
I think it would be so interesting to, like, get to know you on that level.

226
00:09:46,318 --> 00:09:49,722
- To really open up and... - Yes, I want to open up  to you, Nikita.

227
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,890
- ...almost take it off. - I want to open up to you.

228
00:09:51,923 --> 00:09:53,359
- I want to take it off for you, Nikita. - Stop!

229
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:55,694
 Do you want to say<i> "Hola, perras"?</i>

230
00:09:55,727 --> 00:09:57,763
Or I always say<i> "estupidas" </i> as my intro a lot.

231
00:09:57,796 --> 00:09:59,765
- Ooh, that might be better. - Like, "Hey,<i> estupidas."</i>

232
00:09:59,798 --> 00:10:01,067
Yes, let's do that instead.

233
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,874
By my favorite snack.

234
00:10:08,907 --> 00:10:10,676
 Kailin:<i> I'm gonna do a makeup application</i>

235
00:10:10,709 --> 00:10:11,910
inspired by his favorite snack,

236
00:10:11,943 --> 00:10:13,979
which is a huge part of his channel.

237
00:10:14,012 --> 00:10:16,248
But above all else, I really want personality

238
00:10:16,281 --> 00:10:18,384
to show and shine throughout this video.

239
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:20,853
I'm so used to doing longer videos, so if you think this

240
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:24,690
can fit three to five-- what's your goal?

241
00:10:24,723 --> 00:10:27,059
- Five minutes.  I think five minutes. - Five minutes?

242
00:10:27,092 --> 00:10:29,161
- What was your zodiac? - I'm an Aries.

243
00:10:29,194 --> 00:10:33,432
I was thinking of maybe doing-- like painting you as your zodiac.

244
00:10:33,465 --> 00:10:35,367
The reason why I wanted to do something with her zodiac

245
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,069
is because it's trending all over YouTube.

246
00:10:37,102 --> 00:10:39,338
- Um, so, flames. - Yeah, I--

247
00:10:39,371 --> 00:10:41,373
Yeah, let's go.

248
00:10:41,406 --> 00:10:43,175
The plan of the video is to do a five-minute makeup challenge

249
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:44,877
<i> that's really funny</i>

250
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,346
and me and Bretman together is gonna be hilarious.

251
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:49,915
- We got this. Me, too. - I'm so happy that I got you.

252
00:10:51,983 --> 00:10:54,420
- ( both laugh ) - That was so good!

253
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:57,690
- Hit record. - Okay, come closer to me.

254
00:10:57,723 --> 00:11:00,159
You know James is gonna be so particular with that shot.

255
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:04,063
Three, two, one, start!

256
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:07,132
Ah! Okay. One, two...

257
00:11:07,165 --> 00:11:09,435
Foundation, foundation, foundation.

258
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:11,270
Girl, it's not coming out.

259
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:15,307
Oh, shit. Oh, my God!

260
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,309
- We're not doing makeup today. - What?

261
00:11:17,342 --> 00:11:19,845
We're going to be taking it off.

262
00:11:19,878 --> 00:11:22,448
Okay, so, we're gonna start with lashes.

263
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:24,483
- Stop. Okay. - Yeah.

264
00:11:24,516 --> 00:11:26,852
- I'm scared a little bit. - Why are you scared?

265
00:11:26,885 --> 00:11:28,821
Wait, do you want me to soak these off or just pull?

266
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,355
- Yeah, pull 'em off. - You want to pull?

267
00:11:30,388 --> 00:11:32,725
Ah! Ah!

268
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:34,827
Tell me a little bit about her. Who is she?

269
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:38,430
Honestly, I have had so much responsibility in my life.

270
00:11:38,463 --> 00:11:40,733
I was a mom when I was 16, girl.

271
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:43,168
Like, when you're pregnant in high school, that's not easy.

272
00:11:43,201 --> 00:11:44,937
Stop. How was that?

273
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,972
- It was horrible.  It was horrible. - What?

274
00:11:47,005 --> 00:11:49,374
I was, like, a whore to everybody.

275
00:11:49,407 --> 00:11:51,477
( both click tongue ) Hey,<i> estupidas.</i>

276
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,479
Welcome back to my channel. It's your girl Kailin,

277
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:55,848
and today I am with Louie. Louie's Life.

278
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,751
- The baddest<i> perra. </i> - Yes, the baddest<i> perra. </i>

279
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:01,186
God, your lashes look incredible.

280
00:12:01,219 --> 00:12:02,488
Wow, I look like a gremlin next to you.

281
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:05,190
No, you don't. Well, what got you into makeup?

282
00:12:05,223 --> 00:12:07,893
What got me into makeup was I was an artist on paper.

283
00:12:07,926 --> 00:12:09,394
- She's an artist. - Yeah.

284
00:12:09,427 --> 00:12:11,530
I feel like I'm doing a bad job

285
00:12:11,563 --> 00:12:13,299
'cause I feel like I'm not engaging with the camera.

286
00:12:20,872 --> 00:12:22,508
This is, like, my actual, like, first collab.

287
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:26,044
I've never done this. I'm trying to think of talking points,

288
00:12:26,077 --> 00:12:28,413
'cause this seemed like a great idea.

289
00:12:28,446 --> 00:12:30,215
What do you think we're lacking?

290
00:12:30,248 --> 00:12:31,517
Or what do you think could be better?

291
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,418
I think my editing will save me,

292
00:12:33,451 --> 00:12:36,555
but I just think that I need to talk a little bit more.

293
00:12:36,588 --> 00:12:38,924
Okay, let's do the outro.

294
00:12:38,957 --> 00:12:41,226
- Bye, love y'all. - Bye, bitch.

295
00:12:41,259 --> 00:12:44,096
Mwah! Bye, bitch. Aah!

296
00:12:45,597 --> 00:12:47,399
That was really good.

297
00:12:47,432 --> 00:12:49,868
Wow, everyone is still filming.

298
00:12:49,901 --> 00:12:52,104
Yeah, I have two hours to edit. You know what? It's gonna look good.

299
00:12:52,137 --> 00:12:54,072
That's another thing, too. I feel like a lot of people

300
00:12:54,105 --> 00:12:56,475
want bad bitches to, like, fight each other.

301
00:12:56,508 --> 00:12:59,478
Honestly. And it's like, there's room for everyone, girl.

302
00:12:59,511 --> 00:13:01,980
There is. Okay, so should we do outro?

303
00:13:02,013 --> 00:13:03,549
Thank you for doing my makeup. This is literally, like,

304
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:05,450
out of my comfort zone, but I love it.

305
00:13:05,483 --> 00:13:08,287
My God, Benny, we're the first ones back!

306
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,923
We have an hour and 50 minutes.

307
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,458
- Let's go edit. - Let's go. Okay.

308
00:13:13,491 --> 00:13:16,562
- You think you got it? - Um, I sure hope so.

309
00:13:18,196 --> 00:13:20,265
Oh, my gosh. Gabriel.

310
00:13:20,298 --> 00:13:22,367
What did I need?

311
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,971
If he's not back in, like, 10 minutes, that's not good,

312
00:13:26,004 --> 00:13:27,439
because editing takes a long time.

313
00:13:27,472 --> 00:13:29,575
( British accent ) We haven't got much time.

314
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:32,177
( normal voice ) Hi, baby.

315
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:33,846
Oh, you found some crystals, too?

316
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:36,114
Diamonds are a girl's best friend.

317
00:13:36,147 --> 00:13:37,583
- Yes. - Diamonds are a girl's  best friend.

318
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:39,117
I love the diamonds.

319
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:41,854
You're so patient. I really appreciate that.

320
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:43,956
I just want to make sure we have time to edit,

321
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,258
- 'cause I'm scared. - I think we will.

322
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:49,261
Nikita: The challenge for this one is going to be

323
00:13:49,294 --> 00:13:52,164
finding the balance of being vulnerable, funny, entertaining.

324
00:13:52,197 --> 00:13:54,466
If it's not punchy, if it's not every single second is something,

325
00:13:54,499 --> 00:13:56,235
then someone's gonna click off.

326
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:58,604
This is such a dope experience, 'cause I'm literally--

327
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:01,240
- Oh, my God. Stop. Thank you. - I'm learning so much.

328
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:03,242
Try to press that and cover the F-word.

329
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:05,978
( horse whickering )

330
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,512
I love it. I love it.

331
00:14:07,545 --> 00:14:09,248
Okay, let's add some transitions.

332
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:12,150
We could even record it. I feel like it'd be funny.

333
00:14:12,183 --> 00:14:14,152
Oh, my God, you're right. Wait, wait, wait.

334
00:14:14,185 --> 00:14:16,521
- Do I need a lot  of transitions? - No, you don't.

335
00:14:16,554 --> 00:14:18,624
- Do you know how much  footage you have? - We have an hour.

336
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:22,160
- Oh, shit. - I work slow.  That's my weakness.

337
00:14:22,193 --> 00:14:26,198
I would focus more on conversations and comedy than so much makeup.

338
00:14:26,231 --> 00:14:28,500
- 'Cause I'm not sure  what your focus is. - Yeah, I agree.

339
00:14:28,533 --> 00:14:31,336
And I think you adding the dancing is gonna really show,

340
00:14:31,369 --> 00:14:34,006
okay, they definitely did a collab, because it's what I do on my channel.

341
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,340
And then this is your channel, so it's like...

342
00:14:35,373 --> 00:14:37,442
Right now I'm in rush mode.

343
00:14:37,475 --> 00:14:39,979
Okay, I'm kind of thinking we should cut out all the food.

344
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:48,053
Our only option right now is just to start cutting footage left and right.

345
00:14:48,086 --> 00:14:49,688
<i> We're just hoping that what we're cutting</i>

346
00:14:49,721 --> 00:14:51,357
is not ruining this video.

347
00:14:54,025 --> 00:14:55,327
You-- you-- you know more than I do.

348
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,095
- That was so stressful. - ( chuckles )

349
00:14:57,128 --> 00:14:59,197
The most intricate eye look ever.

350
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,934
- Right. - I can barely film a normal  video in under three hours.

351
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:03,669
There is a lot to edit,

352
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:07,039
so we'll do this as good as we can.

353
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,574
You're about to see me, like, be so frantic.

354
00:15:09,607 --> 00:15:13,478
- How much time do we have left? - 26 minutes.

355
00:15:13,511 --> 00:15:16,114
It right now seems very jumpy.

356
00:15:16,147 --> 00:15:19,284
There's just a lot. I'm stressing out.

357
00:15:19,317 --> 00:15:22,120
I really did want to have the talking points in it.

358
00:15:22,153 --> 00:15:24,356
But at this point, I think it should just, like...

359
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:27,359
- Makeup it? - Make it, like, a time lapse.

360
00:15:27,392 --> 00:15:31,530
Right. Then you can go in and pick the specific audio

361
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:33,398
talking points that we had

362
00:15:33,431 --> 00:15:36,401
and you can put that in behind the time lapse.

363
00:15:36,434 --> 00:15:37,970
- I think I got this. - You got this.

364
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:39,438
( muttering )

365
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:42,074
Artists and influencers, you have five minutes left.

366
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,242
Five minutes!

367
00:15:44,275 --> 00:15:46,144
God, I'm nervous.

368
00:15:46,177 --> 00:15:47,612
Let me make sure it looks good.

369
00:15:47,645 --> 00:15:49,414
I'm so scatterbrained that this is gonna, like--

370
00:15:49,447 --> 00:15:50,983
I know it's gonna mess up somehow.

371
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:53,518
Not to put pressure, but there's two minutes left.

372
00:15:53,551 --> 00:15:56,121
- Whoa, whoa.  What the heck? - What happened?

373
00:15:56,154 --> 00:15:58,590
- Wait. Why did it do that? - Why did it do what?

374
00:15:58,623 --> 00:16:02,094
- Oh, my God.  I deleted the footage. - Which footage?

375
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,129
Oh, my God, are we done? I can't...

376
00:16:04,162 --> 00:16:06,098
Wait. Save it, yes. Oh, my God, save.

377
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,733
- Am I gonna hit save? - Save! Press save!

378
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:10,168
- We have... - 58 seconds.

379
00:16:10,201 --> 00:16:13,205
- 56, 55. - No, stop. Press save.  You're making me, like...

380
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:14,306
It won't-- how do I click it?

381
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:16,008
- Click it. - It won't go.

382
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:19,311
( squeals )

383
00:16:22,213 --> 00:16:24,249
Yeah, take that out.

384
00:16:24,282 --> 00:16:27,085
You have to stop. If you don't save it now, you will not get anything.

385
00:16:27,118 --> 00:16:31,223
Five, four, three, two, one!

386
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:33,692
Time's up! Hands up! No more touching.

387
00:16:35,226 --> 00:16:37,496
I'm, like, genuinely terrified.

388
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:38,663
Yay!

389
00:16:38,696 --> 00:16:40,399
Benny, we did it.

390
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:42,300
- Export. - 1080 HP.

391
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:45,771
Put it on Public. Trending. Hashtag.

392
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:48,640
Your videos better be done and ready for the fans to enjoy.

393
00:16:48,673 --> 00:16:50,142
I am so excited to watch,

394
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,745
and I will see you in the judging room.

395
00:16:58,349 --> 00:17:00,152
James: Hello, artists, and welcome back.

396
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,487
I want to introduce our guest judges.

397
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,590
Joining me as usual is Norvina, makeup icon and legend.

398
00:17:05,623 --> 00:17:08,427
And we also have a very, very special guest,

399
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,662
one of my closest friends, Nicole Faulkner,

400
00:17:10,695 --> 00:17:12,330
also known as Lipstick Nick.

401
00:17:12,363 --> 00:17:14,166
She's the Director of Global Artistry for Morphe

402
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,535
and she's the founder of Pout Beauty Bar.

403
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,505
I cannot believe Lipstick Nick is here,

404
00:17:20,538 --> 00:17:23,675
and I'm so excited to see what she has to say about our videos,

405
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:25,343
but I'm also really nervous

406
00:17:25,376 --> 00:17:27,612
because I don't know what my video looks like.

407
00:17:27,645 --> 00:17:29,481
Just like I told you guys earlier,

408
00:17:29,514 --> 00:17:32,150
collaborations are a huge part of being a beauty influencer.

409
00:17:32,183 --> 00:17:34,820
It's all about working together, creating unique content,

410
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:36,588
and sharing each other's audiences.

411
00:17:36,621 --> 00:17:39,157
Remember, you guys, next week is the finale,

412
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,425
and after tonight's elimination,

413
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:43,262
only three artists will be left.

414
00:17:47,198 --> 00:17:48,533
We have a lot of videos to watch,

415
00:17:48,566 --> 00:17:50,168
so Bretman and Benny, we're gonna start

416
00:17:50,201 --> 00:17:51,670
with your guys' collaboration.

417
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:54,539
The rest of you can take a seat.

418
00:17:54,572 --> 00:17:56,241
All right, you guys, let's go ahead and check out

419
00:17:56,274 --> 00:17:59,744
your title and thumbnail. Oh, my God.

420
00:17:59,777 --> 00:18:03,648
"Iconic 5 Minute Makeup Challenge." Would you click or skip?

421
00:18:03,681 --> 00:18:05,750
There's something really funny about it. I would totally click.

422
00:18:05,783 --> 00:18:08,487
- Absolutely click. - In terms of the title,

423
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,355
personally I'm bored of the word "iconic."

424
00:18:10,388 --> 00:18:12,457
I feel like it's, like, very overused.

425
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:15,727
- I guess. - Give me some excitement.  Give me some enthusiasm.

426
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,263
All right, let's check out this collaboration video.

427
00:18:18,296 --> 00:18:20,298
Both: Hey, bitch!

428
00:18:20,331 --> 00:18:24,536
It's your girl Benny Sarah. Welcome back to my channel.

429
00:18:24,569 --> 00:18:28,573
( screams ) Or whatever. It's me, Bretman Rock.

430
00:18:28,606 --> 00:18:30,642
Miss Benny, can I just ask you,

431
00:18:30,675 --> 00:18:32,844
why are you not wearing makeup right now?

432
00:18:32,877 --> 00:18:37,215
Well, we're going to be doing the five-minute makeup challenge.

433
00:18:37,248 --> 00:18:38,617
Shut the-- ( horse whickers )

434
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,519
I did all of this in two hours

435
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:43,355
and you're telling me I only have five minutes to redo all this?

436
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:45,357
I have a date after this.

437
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,726
- Start! - Aah!

438
00:18:48,726 --> 00:18:51,730
Oh, shit! Oh, my God.

439
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:54,266
And we blendin', bitch. And we blendin', bitch.

440
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,902
And we blendin', bitch. Out of time, bitch.

441
00:18:56,935 --> 00:19:00,839
29, 28, 27...

442
00:19:00,872 --> 00:19:03,308
Hurry up, bitch.

443
00:19:03,341 --> 00:19:05,877
- Eleven... - Ten, nine...

444
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:09,281
- Oh, my God. - Four, three, two, one.

445
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,783
- Oh. - ( horse whinnies )

446
00:19:11,816 --> 00:19:14,786
Okay, guys. Thank you so much, Bretman, for being in this video.

447
00:19:14,819 --> 00:19:17,289
- And we both look... - A mess.

448
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,724
- ...very interesting. - But I had so much fun.

449
00:19:19,757 --> 00:19:23,628
That's it for this video. So, bitch, be you.

450
00:19:23,661 --> 00:19:26,898
Always be you. And stand out!

451
00:19:26,931 --> 00:19:30,602
- All right. - Yes!

452
00:19:30,635 --> 00:19:34,940
All right, you guys, Well, this video was definitely very fun and fast-paced,

453
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:37,509
which personally I definitely like to watch.

454
00:19:37,542 --> 00:19:39,311
But maybe with, like, a little bit less of, like,

455
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,446
the profanity and, like, bitches and stuff like that.

456
00:19:41,479 --> 00:19:42,747
Norvina, what do you think?

457
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:43,915
I really liked watching you guys.

458
00:19:43,948 --> 00:19:45,650
You guys were high energy.

459
00:19:45,683 --> 00:19:47,319
You could tell you were having fun.

460
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,553
James: Nicole, what did you think?

461
00:19:48,586 --> 00:19:49,854
I felt like throughout the whole video,

462
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:51,323
you were kind of cut off,

463
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,324
so just try to keep that in mind.

464
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:53,959
Like, center yourself.

465
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:56,595
And I also would've loved instead of you screaming out

466
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:58,830
how many seconds were left, maybe you could've put a clock on there

467
00:19:58,863 --> 00:20:01,333
because that's when you're gonna say funny stuff.

468
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,834
That's good quality content

469
00:20:02,867 --> 00:20:05,637
that you guys could have had banter in those 30 seconds.

470
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:08,640
- Yeah. - Benny, you won today's  Compact Challenge.

471
00:20:08,673 --> 00:20:11,843
What was your strategy in picking Bretman

472
00:20:11,876 --> 00:20:14,813
and then also assigning the influencers?

473
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:19,351
I picked Bretman for me because as I started in makeup in 2015, um,

474
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:22,587
you and Bretman were the only beauty boys I really watched,

475
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,456
and that really inspired me to do makeup.

476
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:27,525
And for everyone else, I was just trying to, like,

477
00:20:27,558 --> 00:20:29,728
pair who I thought would work together.

478
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:32,397
Yeah, so it was definitely like a positive--

479
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:35,467
- Yes. - This is a competition, though.

480
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,638
Well, thank you guys so much for sharing your video with us. Great job.

481
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:42,407
All right, Ashley and Nikita, you guys are up next.

482
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,543
All right, you guys, let's check out your title and thumbnail of your video.

483
00:20:45,576 --> 00:20:47,646
Ooh.

484
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,014
"I Can't Believe I'm Talking About This."

485
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:50,515
Okay, I would instantly click this.

486
00:20:50,548 --> 00:20:52,617
- Same, same. - Of course.

487
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:55,020
Well, let's jump right into your video.

488
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:57,455
Hey, guys. Today we have a very special guest--

489
00:20:57,488 --> 00:21:00,859
- Miss Nikita Dragun. - Oh, my God, hey.

490
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:03,395
Ashley: We're gonna jump into something a little bit different.

491
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,997
We're going to be taking it off.

492
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,932
Oh, girl, I can do that. Hold up.

493
00:21:07,965 --> 00:21:10,869
Nik-- Nikita! No, no, no, no.

494
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:13,571
Nikita, I want you to take my makeup off, and I take off yours.

495
00:21:13,604 --> 00:21:16,608
Just this baddie who's always been

496
00:21:16,641 --> 00:21:19,744
trying to find, like, her confidence throughout life,

497
00:21:19,777 --> 00:21:22,414
especially through my journey of, like, being a mom really young.

498
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:25,383
- Wait, what? - Yeah, girl. I'm a mom.

499
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:28,687
Now he's old enough to where he cheers me on and supports me.

500
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,755
I'm sorry. I'm having an emotional moment as I'm trying to take this off.

501
00:21:30,788 --> 00:21:33,692
I'm like... ( squeals )

502
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:36,928
Nikita, you're really similar to me in so many ways

503
00:21:36,961 --> 00:21:38,963
even though we're such different people.

504
00:21:38,996 --> 00:21:40,965
I have this kind of bad bitch mentality.

505
00:21:40,998 --> 00:21:44,703
It's because that's, like, my almost, like, alter ego.

506
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:48,073
And I just felt like I needed to have, like, a defense mechanism.

507
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:49,974
When you're pregnant in high school, that's not easy.

508
00:21:50,007 --> 00:21:51,743
Nikita, you've been amazing.

509
00:21:51,776 --> 00:21:53,945
Thanks for getting vulnerable with me, girl.

510
00:21:53,978 --> 00:21:56,514
Thanks for letting me take it off without having to take it off

511
00:21:56,547 --> 00:21:58,616
because I would've charged extra.

512
00:21:58,649 --> 00:22:01,453
Thanks for watching this video, and I will see you guys next time.

513
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:05,090
- Oh, my gosh. - That was so good.

514
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:07,459
I don't know you, but you're a baddie, you know what I mean?

515
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,627
You guys wore the same damn stripper shoes today.

516
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:12,797
It's amazing. And that can be intimidating to a lot of people,

517
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:15,800
so I love that I got to see, like, your vulnerable side,

518
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:17,469
and that makes you like a girl's girl to me,

519
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,738
both of you, so I really connected with that.

520
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:23,775
There was one part where Nikita started opening up about some real shit,

521
00:22:23,808 --> 00:22:25,810
and then you, like, randomly jumped

522
00:22:25,843 --> 00:22:27,645
and started talking about yourself again, and your pregnancy.

523
00:22:27,678 --> 00:22:29,647
And I was like, "Oh, okay. We're going back to you."

524
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,416
I think it was just an editing flaw,

525
00:22:31,449 --> 00:22:33,752
but overall I think it was a really cool concept, so...

526
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:35,420
Wow, that means a lot. Thank you.

527
00:22:35,453 --> 00:22:36,988
Nicole made a really good point about, like,

528
00:22:37,021 --> 00:22:38,556
I'm sure you let her finish in person,

529
00:22:38,589 --> 00:22:39,924
but on the video, we didn't see it.

530
00:22:39,957 --> 00:22:42,827
- It looks a little... - That is something

531
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:45,697
that as a content creator is so frustrating,

532
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:47,832
because there have been so many videos that I have posted

533
00:22:47,865 --> 00:22:49,601
where I've gotten thousands of hate comments,

534
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:50,969
"Oh, my God. Why did he say this?"

535
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:52,837
Or, "He should've let this person talk more."

536
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:54,172
And this is for everybody as well.

537
00:22:54,205 --> 00:22:55,874
Think about what the viewer's gonna watch

538
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:59,010
and how the organization might affect that experience.

539
00:22:59,043 --> 00:23:00,845
Understand. Thank you.

540
00:23:00,878 --> 00:23:03,081
But, Ashley, it was really awesome to finally...

541
00:23:03,114 --> 00:23:07,185
- I knew it. - ...finally see you open up  and be vulnerable.

542
00:23:07,218 --> 00:23:10,855
I love your guys' concept of de-glamming and getting vulnerable together.

543
00:23:10,888 --> 00:23:13,858
I wish you would've explained why when you take your makeup off

544
00:23:13,891 --> 00:23:16,027
it's like showing your true authentic self.

545
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:18,496
You kind of just jumped right in without a proper explanation.

546
00:23:18,529 --> 00:23:20,064
Then all of the sudden, we're just getting lashes ripped off.

547
00:23:20,097 --> 00:23:22,867
- Right. - It was amazing  hearing your story.

548
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,769
First time I've heard that story.

549
00:23:24,802 --> 00:23:26,504
That's the first time I've shared it.

550
00:23:26,537 --> 00:23:28,706
I'm sure there's a lot of young moms out there

551
00:23:28,739 --> 00:23:30,875
that are watching and going like, "Tell me how you do it.

552
00:23:30,908 --> 00:23:34,579
How are you taking care of your son and then also filming videos

553
00:23:34,612 --> 00:23:36,181
and collaborating with brands? How do you do this?"

554
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:38,983
- I wanted to know more. - Get more into it.

555
00:23:39,016 --> 00:23:40,685
- Absolutely. - Understand.

556
00:23:40,718 --> 00:23:42,620
All right, Nikita and Ashley, thank you guys so much.

557
00:23:42,653 --> 00:23:44,088
You can take a seat.

558
00:23:44,121 --> 00:23:45,990
All right, Gabriel and Nyma, come on down.

559
00:23:46,023 --> 00:23:49,894
Ooh. "My Zodiac Chooses My High Fashion Look."

560
00:23:49,927 --> 00:23:52,797
- Oh, James is gonna love that. - I would click this because

561
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:56,734
I have a new interest in zodiac because of Norvina, actually,

562
00:23:56,767 --> 00:23:58,636
and a lot of people are very interested in it.

563
00:23:58,669 --> 00:24:00,004
I mean, I would click it 'cause of the makeup.

564
00:24:00,037 --> 00:24:02,240
It's striking. This red eye shadow's beautiful.

565
00:24:02,273 --> 00:24:04,209
- Let's jump in. - Lovely.

566
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:06,644
Nyma Tang. How are you guys doing?

567
00:24:06,677 --> 00:24:09,113
- So, I'm so happy  to have you on my channel. - Thank you for having me.

568
00:24:09,146 --> 00:24:11,149
Thank you for letting me do this with you.

569
00:24:11,182 --> 00:24:12,650
I'm excited to see what you can do.

570
00:24:12,683 --> 00:24:15,553
So, as you can see, I already started her lip.

571
00:24:15,586 --> 00:24:17,755
Her being an Aries, she is a fire sign,

572
00:24:17,788 --> 00:24:19,924
so that's what is inspiring this look today.

573
00:24:19,957 --> 00:24:23,829
This is where it gets ugly.

574
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:29,568
( no audio )

575
00:24:31,202 --> 00:24:33,271
( no audio )

576
00:24:33,304 --> 00:24:34,772
Thank you so much for watching.

577
00:24:34,805 --> 00:24:37,108
- I love you all. - Bye!

578
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:41,212
I thought the makeup was gorgeous.

579
00:24:41,245 --> 00:24:42,981
<i> She looks stunning.</i>

580
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:44,816
I think one important thing that I want to add

581
00:24:44,849 --> 00:24:47,051
for you, Gabriel, is you really have to

582
00:24:47,084 --> 00:24:48,953
set your intention on what it means

583
00:24:48,986 --> 00:24:50,955
to be an influencer for you

584
00:24:50,988 --> 00:24:53,691
because that is how you should approach the project.

585
00:24:53,724 --> 00:24:54,959
And I would love for you

586
00:24:54,992 --> 00:24:56,261
to just collect yourself a little bit

587
00:24:56,294 --> 00:24:58,563
and have a plan in the future.

588
00:24:58,596 --> 00:25:01,633
Nyma is such a-- such a stunning canvas to work on,

589
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,668
and I really, really like the look you created on her.

590
00:25:03,701 --> 00:25:06,137
Unfortunately, there was technical problems.

591
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:09,140
I would've loved an introduction into the video.

592
00:25:09,173 --> 00:25:11,709
There was, actually. It was cut off.

593
00:25:11,742 --> 00:25:13,077
There was a lot of footage.

594
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,812
I really tried to edit as much as I could,

595
00:25:14,845 --> 00:25:15,980
but it didn't work out.

596
00:25:16,013 --> 00:25:18,149
Your artistry is insane,

597
00:25:18,182 --> 00:25:19,918
but for a video like this that's gonna live long,

598
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:22,086
it's way more about personality than anything,

599
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:23,821
especially in a collab video.

600
00:25:23,854 --> 00:25:25,657
Thank you so much.

601
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,025
Gabriel:<i> I'm really satisfied with my artistry,</i>

602
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:29,694
but I'm feeling really not good.

603
00:25:29,727 --> 00:25:31,996
All right, Louie and Kailin.

604
00:25:32,029 --> 00:25:36,334
Ooh! "Hang With Me And Louie's Life: It's A Party."

605
00:25:36,367 --> 00:25:38,169
- Very cute. - Okay, before we even  watch the video,

606
00:25:38,202 --> 00:25:40,338
would you guys click it or skip it?

607
00:25:40,371 --> 00:25:41,973
- Norvina: I would click it. - James: You would click it?

608
00:25:42,006 --> 00:25:44,008
- Yes. - I would click it  because of the makeup.

609
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:47,011
But I personally like more of a, like--

610
00:25:47,044 --> 00:25:49,047
a title where I know what I'm about to watch.

611
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,115
- It just seems like a hangout. - Yeah.

612
00:25:51,148 --> 00:25:52,951
Okay, let's jump in to the video.

613
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:55,019
Both: Hey,<i> estupidas.</i>

614
00:25:55,052 --> 00:25:56,888
Welcome back to my channel. It's your girl Kailin,

615
00:25:56,921 --> 00:25:59,757
and today I'm with Louie. Louie's Life.

616
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:02,994
- The baddest<i> perra. </i> - Yes, the baddest<i> perra </i>  in all the land.

617
00:26:03,027 --> 00:26:05,597
We're just gonna have a good time. That's what's gonna happen.

618
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,198
We're gonna cheese me out. We're gonna do some makeup.

619
00:26:07,231 --> 00:26:09,033
- It's gonna be a blast. - Yeah, it is.

620
00:26:09,066 --> 00:26:10,735
We're doing a little Red Hot moment. You down with that?

621
00:26:10,768 --> 00:26:13,204
- Little Red Hot moment. - Inspired by his videos,

622
00:26:13,237 --> 00:26:14,839
- and kind of  his favorite snack. - My favorite snack.

623
00:26:14,872 --> 00:26:16,874
If you guys want to see his favorite snack,

624
00:26:16,907 --> 00:26:18,176
you're gonna have to go to his channel,

625
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:19,777
because that's what this is all about.

626
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:21,779
- ( speaks Spanish ) - Yes, get over there.

627
00:26:21,812 --> 00:26:24,649
So, I wanna, like, know more about, like, your start,

628
00:26:24,682 --> 00:26:26,718
- and how you got into it. - Okay.

629
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,319
'Cause you've been doing this for a while, right?

630
00:26:28,352 --> 00:26:31,856
For a minute. I started doing YouTube, like, five years ago.

631
00:26:31,889 --> 00:26:34,058
So this would not be a Louie's Life video

632
00:26:34,091 --> 00:26:37,228
if we did not take a moment to dance.

633
00:26:37,261 --> 00:26:40,365
Mmm! I'm gonna show you the jean grabber.

634
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:43,234
So this is the girl who is always dancing-- yes!

635
00:26:43,267 --> 00:26:46,270
You know her. Do a little turn.

636
00:26:46,303 --> 00:26:49,741
Oh, yeah. Thank you so much for being in my video

637
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,342
and hanging with me on my channel.

638
00:26:51,375 --> 00:26:52,977
- It was so much fun  to have you. - Thank you.

639
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:56,381
- Until next time. - Both: Mwah! Bye, beauties!

640
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:59,384
So beautiful. I literally can't. You're stunning.

641
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:00,852
So, what do you want me to do for the B-roll?

642
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:03,321
I'm gonna zoom in.

643
00:27:03,354 --> 00:27:06,391
Do you want it more-- do you like it more zoomed in?

644
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:08,192
Whatever works for you.

645
00:27:08,225 --> 00:27:11,129
Whatever. I'm gonna laugh at it.

646
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:12,631
- ( applause ) - Yay!

647
00:27:13,831 --> 00:27:16,000
- Norvina? - I loved the opening.

648
00:27:16,033 --> 00:27:18,236
I thought you guys had such great chemistry.

649
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:21,406
That being said, I felt like I was watching a makeup artist

650
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:24,942
just doing makeup on her client and engaging with a client

651
00:27:24,975 --> 00:27:26,844
that has an incredible personality.

652
00:27:26,877 --> 00:27:28,780
So I was just watching Louie,

653
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,748
but I felt like you kind of faded into the background.

654
00:27:30,781 --> 00:27:31,783
- Yeah. - So something to, you know,

655
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,251
think about for next time.

656
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:36,020
I am also Hispanic and I am a jean grabber, so--

657
00:27:36,053 --> 00:27:38,956
- She knows! - Okay, I relate.  I can relate.

658
00:27:38,989 --> 00:27:40,992
So, I loved that, and I know that it is hard

659
00:27:41,025 --> 00:27:43,795
<i> to work and kind of turn your head,</i>

660
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:45,196
but I would've liked to see you turn your face

661
00:27:45,229 --> 00:27:46,330
a little more to the camera.

662
00:27:46,363 --> 00:27:47,965
- Yes. - Norvina: Absolutely.

663
00:27:47,998 --> 00:27:49,967
Your vibe together was really positive.

664
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,936
It seemed like I was just hanging out with two friends.

665
00:27:51,969 --> 00:27:54,038
That's what you want a collab video to feel like.

666
00:27:54,071 --> 00:27:55,973
Obviously, there were some cut issues in the end.

667
00:27:56,006 --> 00:27:58,242
Kailin, you struggle a lot with time management.

668
00:27:58,275 --> 00:28:01,245
There were a few times where the video just jumped from one topic to another.

669
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:04,282
When I went on my cutting spree, I cut out those prompts,

670
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:07,151
and then I accidentally cut out those endings and...

671
00:28:07,184 --> 00:28:08,920
James: But it's really about picking a concept

672
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:11,856
that you know you can execute in that time period.

673
00:28:11,889 --> 00:28:14,459
Well, thank you both so much. You can go ahead and take a seat.

674
00:28:14,492 --> 00:28:16,194
Kailin:<i> I know I could've done better,</i>

675
00:28:16,227 --> 00:28:19,931
and for me to have made it this close to the finale,

676
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:22,033
I'm just annoyed at myself.

677
00:28:22,066 --> 00:28:23,835
Artists, amazing job today.

678
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,870
Your collab videos were so entertaining to watch.

679
00:28:25,903 --> 00:28:27,438
This has been incredible.

680
00:28:27,471 --> 00:28:29,273
I want to say a major, major thank you to Nyma,

681
00:28:29,306 --> 00:28:31,375
Nikita, Bretman, and Louie for joining us today.

682
00:28:31,408 --> 00:28:34,278
I love you guys all so much.

683
00:28:34,311 --> 00:28:36,481
You all killed it, and thank you for bringing

684
00:28:36,514 --> 00:28:39,951
your personalities and also your knowledge to these influencers.

685
00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:42,987
We judges have definitely a whole lot of thinking to do.

686
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,289
You guys can head on off, and we'll see you in a little bit.

687
00:28:45,322 --> 00:28:47,459
- All right. Good luck, guys. - Thank you, guys.

688
00:28:53,531 --> 00:28:55,500
Oh, my God.

689
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:57,201
Beyond drained.

690
00:28:57,234 --> 00:28:59,036
So, this is a really, really important decision,

691
00:28:59,069 --> 00:29:00,905
because obviously what we decide right now

692
00:29:00,938 --> 00:29:02,907
- is who makes it  to the finale. - Yeah.

693
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:05,343
- Right. - Well, let's talk about Benny.

694
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:07,845
Bretman was, like, such a big support for me.

695
00:29:07,878 --> 00:29:11,282
- Confidence boost. - But I just am scared  because you never know.

696
00:29:11,315 --> 00:29:13,985
This video was super fun, but it feels like

697
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:16,087
- he's putting on a persona. - Yeah.

698
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,322
I enjoyed watching theirs the most out of everyone.

699
00:29:18,355 --> 00:29:21,392
- Really? - Yeah, and I felt like Benny  really held his own.

700
00:29:21,425 --> 00:29:23,127
Let's talk about Nikita and Ashley.

701
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,262
I started getting teary,

702
00:29:24,295 --> 00:29:26,230
and I was pinching my freaking thumb.

703
00:29:26,263 --> 00:29:27,899
And I was like, "Stop it."

704
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:29,467
Any time I talk about my son, that's, like, a trigger.

705
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,902
This was a very, like,

706
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,403
female empowerment type of video

707
00:29:32,436 --> 00:29:34,005
and I felt very inspired.

708
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:36,073
So I really connected with that whole thing.

709
00:29:36,106 --> 00:29:37,542
This was my favorite one of the day.

710
00:29:37,575 --> 00:29:39,410
But she never connected

711
00:29:39,443 --> 00:29:41,379
the removing the makeup and the vulnerable...

712
00:29:41,412 --> 00:29:43,247
- Yeah. - ...which could've made it  so much stronger.

713
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,216
- Two seconds. - Should've been clear, yeah.

714
00:29:45,249 --> 00:29:48,252
Shall we talk about the elephant in the room?

715
00:29:48,285 --> 00:29:52,056
The overthinker in me was like, "Add more. This is not enough."

716
00:29:52,089 --> 00:29:53,991
But I really regret it.

717
00:29:54,024 --> 00:29:55,827
I should've taken that time to go and edit.

718
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,261
From what I've seen today, at least,

719
00:29:57,294 --> 00:29:59,263
I don't know anyone else's level of artistry,

720
00:29:59,296 --> 00:30:01,432
but he looks, like, crazy good.

721
00:30:01,465 --> 00:30:03,901
He's insanely talented when it comes to artistry.

722
00:30:03,934 --> 00:30:06,571
But we have just not gotten to know who Gabriel is as an influencer.

723
00:30:06,604 --> 00:30:09,373
- Right. - Okay, let's move on  to our final video,

724
00:30:09,406 --> 00:30:11,142
Kailin and Louie.

725
00:30:11,175 --> 00:30:13,544
I just feel like she started amazing.

726
00:30:13,577 --> 00:30:17,281
And then it just kind of-- I was like, "Kailin, where are you going?"

727
00:30:17,314 --> 00:30:18,583
Yeah. I did like that she got up and danced.

728
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:20,384
Like, I felt like there was funny moments.

729
00:30:20,417 --> 00:30:22,119
And if there was more,

730
00:30:22,152 --> 00:30:23,955
I wish she would've kept that stuff in.

731
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,429
Although the editing was not great,

732
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:33,264
it made me want to watch more of them.

733
00:30:33,297 --> 00:30:35,299
All right, well, it definitely seems like

734
00:30:35,332 --> 00:30:36,601
we have our decision made up

735
00:30:36,634 --> 00:30:39,136
about who is moving on to the finale.

736
00:30:39,169 --> 00:30:41,038
- We do. - We do.

737
00:30:41,071 --> 00:30:43,207
Norvina, thank you for joining us tonight.

738
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,176
- Thank you, James. - I love you and I will  see you next week.

739
00:30:45,209 --> 00:30:47,612
And, Nicole, thank you so much for bringing

740
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:49,580
your knowledge and artistry to the competition

741
00:30:49,613 --> 00:30:50,615
and I really appreciate your time.

742
00:30:50,648 --> 00:30:52,383
- I love you. - Love you more!

743
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:54,219
- Thanks for having me. - ( sighs )

744
00:31:06,363 --> 00:31:08,900
- ( line ringing ) - Hi, everyone.

745
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:10,635
- Hi, James. - Hi, James.

746
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:13,504
I wanted to give you all some news together this time.

747
00:31:13,537 --> 00:31:15,406
All right.

748
00:31:15,439 --> 00:31:18,175
Some of your collab videos today really clicked,

749
00:31:18,208 --> 00:31:22,680
but some of them made me want to click away.

750
00:31:22,713 --> 00:31:25,884
Oh. Is he gonna come back on?

751
00:31:27,384 --> 00:31:31,222
James: Ashley, Benny,

752
00:31:31,255 --> 00:31:33,424
and Kailin...

753
00:31:33,457 --> 00:31:35,192
congratulations,

754
00:31:35,225 --> 00:31:37,428
the three of you have made it to the finale.

755
00:31:37,461 --> 00:31:40,298
Please come join me back in the work room. 

756
00:31:40,331 --> 00:31:42,066
Nice.

757
00:31:42,099 --> 00:31:45,036
- Yes. - Oh, my God.

758
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,370
I made it.

759
00:31:46,403 --> 00:31:50,207
I came into this not feeling like I deserved

760
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,943
to even make it through night one.

761
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:55,012
<i> And for me to have made it to the finale,</i>

762
00:31:55,045 --> 00:31:57,248
like, I'm really grateful.

763
00:31:57,281 --> 00:31:58,683
( knock on door )

764
00:31:58,716 --> 00:32:02,153
Hi, Gabriel.

765
00:32:02,186 --> 00:32:03,454
I think you know why I'm here.

766
00:32:03,487 --> 00:32:05,723
Unfortunately, out of the collab videos today,

767
00:32:05,756 --> 00:32:08,259
- the others really shined... - Of course.

768
00:32:08,292 --> 00:32:09,694
...and yours was the weakest video

769
00:32:09,727 --> 00:32:11,662
and I have to send you home.

770
00:32:11,695 --> 00:32:14,031
I want to make sure you know I am so proud of you.

771
00:32:14,064 --> 00:32:15,433
Technical difficulties and time management

772
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:17,468
are real issues that happen all the time.

773
00:32:17,501 --> 00:32:20,237
Been there, done that, and I believe in you so much

774
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,605
to be able to learn and grow from this.

775
00:32:21,638 --> 00:32:24,108
You are such an incredible makeup artist,

776
00:32:24,141 --> 00:32:27,411
and the detail work in your looks literally blows my mind.

777
00:32:27,444 --> 00:32:29,080
Like, there's so much that I want to learn from you.

778
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:31,716
This experience taught me what my life is about

779
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:33,584
and what I want to do with it,

780
00:32:33,617 --> 00:32:36,053
because coming from a background where I didn't have much,

781
00:32:36,086 --> 00:32:37,989
<i> sometimes I can be hard on myself,</i>

782
00:32:38,022 --> 00:32:39,190
but I really made myself proud.

783
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:41,092
We got to know you as an artist,

784
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:42,460
but we want to know who is the influencer

785
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:44,528
underneath the influential artist?

786
00:32:44,561 --> 00:32:46,297
'Cause he's there, and we want to see him

787
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:48,165
and I'm so excited to watch you grow even more.

788
00:32:48,198 --> 00:32:50,634
- Thank you. - Before we go ahead  and send you home,

789
00:32:50,667 --> 00:32:52,737
- I want to sign off  together, okay? - Okay.

790
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,505
All right, you guys, thank you so much for watching

791
00:32:54,538 --> 00:32:56,741
"Instant Influencer" episode three.

792
00:32:56,774 --> 00:32:58,743
I am joined by the beautiful,

793
00:32:58,776 --> 00:33:02,046
the incredibly talented Gabriel Dreams.

794
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:03,447
You guys, make sure you go check out his work.

795
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,250
He is so incredible. Where can they find you?

796
00:33:06,283 --> 00:33:09,086
It's Gabriel Dreams on all social media.

797
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:12,123
Both: Bye, Dreamers.

798
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:15,092
- We are the final three! - Yeah!

799
00:33:15,125 --> 00:33:16,627
I'm really excited and thrilled

800
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,629
because I just can't believe it's all happening.

801
00:33:18,662 --> 00:33:21,098
<i> I put a lot of work and effort into this competition,</i>

802
00:33:21,131 --> 00:33:23,768
so, yeah, I'm definitely ready for this.

803
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:27,171
- Hello, my three finalists! - Oh, my gosh!

804
00:33:27,204 --> 00:33:30,107
- Hi, James. - How are you guys  feeling right now?

805
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:32,810
- So, so happy.  I am so ecstatic. - So happy.

806
00:33:32,843 --> 00:33:35,046
Ashley: Relieved and more nervous, actually, if that makes sense.

807
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:37,782
Now it's setting in and it's really, really getting real.

808
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:39,683
Next week is the finale.

809
00:33:39,716 --> 00:33:42,520
I want you guys to get ready to think big.

810
00:33:42,553 --> 00:33:45,389
That is your only hint that I'm giving you for the finale challenge.

811
00:33:45,422 --> 00:33:48,159
- Wow. - I'm very proud  of the three of you.

812
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:49,794
Go home, get some rest,

813
00:33:49,827 --> 00:33:51,796
and I'll see you very, very soon.

814
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:54,198
- Bye, James. Thank you! - Thank you so much.

815
00:33:54,231 --> 00:33:55,399
I wonder what the challenge is gonna be?

816
00:33:55,432 --> 00:33:57,201
- "Think big"? - "Think big."

817
00:33:57,234 --> 00:33:59,503
- What does that even mean? - "Think big."

818
00:33:59,536 --> 00:34:03,074
Thank you so much for watching this episode of "Instant Influencer."

819
00:34:03,107 --> 00:34:04,508
If you enjoyed it, please don't forget

820
00:34:04,541 --> 00:34:06,177
to give it a big thumb's up down below

821
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,812

822
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:09,346

00:34:15,385 --> 00:34:17,188
