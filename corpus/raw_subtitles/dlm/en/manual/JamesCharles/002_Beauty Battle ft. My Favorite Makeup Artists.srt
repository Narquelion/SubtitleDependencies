00:00:00,284 --> 00:00:01,619
- Hi sisters!

2
00:00:01,619 --> 00:00:04,324
James Charles here and welcome back to my YouTube channel!

3
00:00:04,324 --> 00:00:06,611
Oh my god you guys today's video I am so beyond excited

4
00:00:06,611 --> 00:00:07,772
because as you can see I have

5
00:00:07,772 --> 00:00:10,675
two very very iconic sister special guests!

6
00:00:10,675 --> 00:00:11,508
- Jake

7
00:00:11,508 --> 00:00:12,341
- And Riquelle

8
00:00:12,341 --> 00:00:13,914
- You guys Jake and Riquelle are two of my favorite artists

9
00:00:13,914 --> 00:00:15,040
to follow on Instagram right now.

10
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,594
They are both super young, Jake is 15, right?

11
00:00:17,594 --> 00:00:18,918
And you are 17.

12
00:00:18,918 --> 00:00:20,717
Both young and both killing it,

13
00:00:20,717 --> 00:00:22,668
literally both of their looks are so insane,

14
00:00:22,668 --> 00:00:25,036
so creative and they are just both so talented.

15
00:00:25,036 --> 00:00:27,045
Both have been amazing friends and inspiration to me

16
00:00:27,045 --> 00:00:28,786
and for today's video I wanted to bring them here

17
00:00:28,786 --> 00:00:31,410
on my channel and do a beauty battle,

18
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,581
which I am so excited for because as you guys all know

19
00:00:33,581 --> 00:00:35,311
this is a series I do here on my channel

20
00:00:35,311 --> 00:00:37,273
where two different people take half my face of makeup

21
00:00:37,273 --> 00:00:39,351
but in the past though, all the episodes

22
00:00:39,351 --> 00:00:41,011
have been with friends that don't really know a lot

23
00:00:41,011 --> 00:00:42,823
about makeup, but this is different

24
00:00:42,823 --> 00:00:45,354
because this is literally two artists

25
00:00:45,354 --> 00:00:48,395
who actually know what they're doing, doing half my face.

26
00:00:48,395 --> 00:00:50,299
So the three of us are just gonna play in some makeup today,

27
00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:52,041
Jake and Riquelle are gonna split my face right in half

28
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:55,698
and give me an iconic signature look in their very own style

29
00:00:55,698 --> 00:00:57,227
and at the end of course all you sisters will decide

30
00:00:57,227 --> 00:00:59,467
which look was your favorite in this little friendly

31
00:00:59,467 --> 00:01:01,511
beauty battle, we're gonna talk about all things

32
00:01:01,511 --> 00:01:03,670
in the beauty industry, what it's like being in the industry

33
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,423
at such a young age, because obviously you guys know

34
00:01:05,423 --> 00:01:07,188
I came in when I was 16 years old too,

35
00:01:07,188 --> 00:01:09,394
so right smack dab in the middle of you guys.

36
00:01:09,394 --> 00:01:10,961
What it's like being a small influencer,

37
00:01:10,961 --> 00:01:12,215
what the community can improve on,

38
00:01:12,215 --> 00:01:13,666
and of course too you guys obviously know

39
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:14,851
I'm always here for you as friends

40
00:01:14,851 --> 00:01:16,406
and I'm sure so many people watching this video

41
00:01:16,406 --> 00:01:17,962
want to be an influencer one day

42
00:01:17,962 --> 00:01:19,854
and really wanna join the makeup community,

43
00:01:19,854 --> 00:01:20,992
and I feel like you guys are both

44
00:01:20,992 --> 00:01:21,979
absolutely killing it right now

45
00:01:21,979 --> 00:01:25,300
so it could be really fun to ask some questions as well

46
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,053
and I can kinda answer them and give you guys advice

47
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:29,549
and some other people want your advice too!

48
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:30,382
Sound good?

49
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:31,755
Okay - Let's do it

50
00:01:31,755 --> 00:01:33,833
Without further ado, let's jump right in.

51
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:36,666
(uplifting music)

52
00:01:41,147 --> 00:01:41,980
So do you guys have any ideas

53
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,527
to what look you wanna do yet?

54
00:01:43,527 --> 00:01:47,057
- Since Valentine's coming up I think I wanna use

55
00:01:47,057 --> 00:01:49,506
some inspo on the look I did.

56
00:01:49,506 --> 00:01:52,885
- Okay love that, love that a little hearts moment.

57
00:01:52,885 --> 00:01:53,872
Are you single?

58
00:01:53,872 --> 00:01:54,705
- Yeah.

59
00:01:54,705 --> 00:01:55,671
- Same - Fortunately.

60
00:01:55,671 --> 00:01:56,565
- You?

61
00:01:56,565 --> 00:01:59,108
- I'm just gonna do something rainbow, colorful.

62
00:01:59,108 --> 00:02:00,292
- Okay, love that.

63
00:02:00,292 --> 00:02:01,604
- Inspired by these.

64
00:02:01,604 --> 00:02:03,357
- Ooh the rainbow nails, okay, down.

65
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:04,936
(tongue pop)

66
00:02:04,936 --> 00:02:06,480
Love a good tongue pop moment!

67
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,351
(tongue pop)

68
00:02:07,351 --> 00:02:09,023
That's good I feel like nobody can ever do that!

69
00:02:09,023 --> 00:02:10,683
Wow that's good and fresh!

70
00:02:10,683 --> 00:02:11,554
- Yes.

71
00:02:11,554 --> 00:02:12,691
- Sorry Jake you're out of the picture now.

72
00:02:12,691 --> 00:02:13,934
(gasps)

73
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:14,767
Replaced.

74
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:16,093
Well I feel like this is gonna be quite a long day

75
00:02:16,093 --> 00:02:17,742
of lots of glamming, this is gonna be a little bit

76
00:02:17,742 --> 00:02:20,203
of an unusual beauty battle, slightly longer than normal

77
00:02:20,203 --> 00:02:21,318
so should we just jump right in?

78
00:02:21,318 --> 00:02:22,151
- Yes.

79
00:02:22,151 --> 00:02:23,500
- Alright go for it.

80
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,383
- Okay.

81
00:02:24,383 --> 00:02:25,428
- My face is your canvas.

82
00:02:25,428 --> 00:02:26,261
- Just go?

83
00:02:26,261 --> 00:02:27,094
- Yeah go for it!

84
00:02:27,094 --> 00:02:28,028
- Okay I'm just brushing out the hairs

85
00:02:28,028 --> 00:02:30,849
of James' brows just to start.

86
00:02:30,849 --> 00:02:32,544
- Okay so I am so excited that you guys were able to

87
00:02:32,544 --> 00:02:34,820
join me here today, both from the Bay Area actually

88
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,386
so both of you traveled quite far and wide.

89
00:02:37,386 --> 00:02:40,416
- Yeah the last time I was here I was at James' launch party

90
00:02:40,416 --> 00:02:42,239
- Oh yeah for the palette!

91
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,387
- Yes it was honestly so much fun,

92
00:02:44,387 --> 00:02:47,463
being a smaller artist it was really nice to meet

93
00:02:47,463 --> 00:02:49,007
bigger influencers that were there

94
00:02:49,007 --> 00:02:51,074
and be able to talk with them.

95
00:02:51,074 --> 00:02:52,154
- Was that your first makeup event?

96
00:02:52,154 --> 00:02:53,350
- Yes.

97
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,267
- Yeah me too.

98
00:02:54,267 --> 00:02:55,100
- Wait was it really?

99
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:55,933
- Mhm

100
00:02:55,933 --> 00:02:56,766
- Yeah

101
00:02:56,766 --> 00:02:57,599
- Oh my god!

102
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,432
- Yeah

103
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,265
- For the first one, that's like crazy.

104
00:02:59,265 --> 00:03:00,098
- A pretty good one

105
00:03:00,098 --> 00:03:00,931
- Yeah - Yeah

106
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:01,764
- A pretty good first start, huh?

107
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:02,597
(laughs)

108
00:03:02,597 --> 00:03:03,671
How did you both get started into makeup?

109
00:03:03,671 --> 00:03:05,993
I want Riquelle to answer first cause I know Jake's answer.

110
00:03:05,993 --> 00:03:06,826
- Yeah

111
00:03:06,826 --> 00:03:09,186
- Okay well I liked art when I was little

112
00:03:09,186 --> 00:03:10,019
- Same

113
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:11,566
- And so pretty much just like it came from that,

114
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:15,594
like I always drew starting when I was like four or five.

115
00:03:15,594 --> 00:03:18,717
And I just got into makeup when I was in like middle school.

116
00:03:18,717 --> 00:03:21,190
- I love that really early start, okay cool.

117
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,652
- I started my Instagram because people from school

118
00:03:23,652 --> 00:03:25,683
and like different clients asked me

119
00:03:25,683 --> 00:03:28,307
to like start posting makeup looks.

120
00:03:28,307 --> 00:03:29,967
- Yeah, that's how I got started too.

121
00:03:29,967 --> 00:03:31,140
- I started posting just clients

122
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,021
and then I started posting my makeup,

123
00:03:33,021 --> 00:03:35,889
then I was like, oh, people like this better than clients.

124
00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:36,722
(laughs)

125
00:03:36,722 --> 00:03:38,559
Because nobody wants to see the same nude ass eyeshadow look

126
00:03:38,559 --> 00:03:39,392
- Yeah.

127
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,225
So Jake,

128
00:03:40,225 --> 00:03:41,058
- Yes.

129
00:03:41,058 --> 00:03:41,891
- How did you get started?

130
00:03:41,891 --> 00:03:45,308
- Well I think it's very clearly obvious.

131
00:03:46,221 --> 00:03:47,208
- I think this is literally the cutest thing

132
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:48,041
in the entire world.

133
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:49,194
Can I just say it?

134
00:03:49,194 --> 00:03:50,027
- Go for it.

135
00:03:50,027 --> 00:03:50,860
(clapping)

136
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,245
- Okay so Jake, when I first started on Instagram,

137
00:03:53,245 --> 00:03:55,869
Jake was actually my first ever fan page.

138
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:56,702
- Mhm.

139
00:03:56,702 --> 00:03:57,535
- Literally, it was James Charles

140
00:03:57,535 --> 00:03:59,027
with two z's after it right? - Yeah.

141
00:03:59,027 --> 00:04:00,722
- And I always just thought he was so sweet,

142
00:04:00,722 --> 00:04:02,057
he always left the sweetest comments

143
00:04:02,057 --> 00:04:04,205
and then eventually he like posted a picture of himself

144
00:04:04,205 --> 00:04:05,038
- Yeah

145
00:04:05,038 --> 00:04:06,400
- Like wearing makeup and I was like oh my god

146
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,106
this kid is so cute and so talented

147
00:04:08,106 --> 00:04:09,929
and then you eventually left the page

148
00:04:09,929 --> 00:04:10,762
- Yeah

149
00:04:10,762 --> 00:04:11,949
- Really rude, it's okay there's lots of other

150
00:04:11,949 --> 00:04:14,712
sister fan pages now, but you started doing your own

151
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:16,535
stuff which I thought was so incredibly cool

152
00:04:16,535 --> 00:04:18,683
because you literally are so incredibly talented.

153
00:04:18,683 --> 00:04:19,516
- Thank you

154
00:04:19,516 --> 00:04:20,761
- And I feel like we definitely look very similar

155
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,839
and have similar styles too so everyone started saying

156
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:25,161
like you're my son which I thought was so cute

157
00:04:25,161 --> 00:04:27,425
- I remember seeing the Covergirl Ad,

158
00:04:27,425 --> 00:04:29,329
and I remember just seeing James

159
00:04:29,329 --> 00:04:33,311
and then I was like wow, this is such a beautiful boy

160
00:04:33,311 --> 00:04:36,249
like I'd never seen that before.

161
00:04:36,249 --> 00:04:37,082
- Yeah.

162
00:04:37,082 --> 00:04:40,103
- And it just like opened something in my mind

163
00:04:40,103 --> 00:04:42,669
that was like boys can wear makeup too.

164
00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:44,736
- So Jake definitely does a lot of creative looks

165
00:04:44,736 --> 00:04:46,628
kinda like how I first got my start on Instagram

166
00:04:46,628 --> 00:04:48,648
and it's honestly funny too because you've done so

167
00:04:48,648 --> 00:04:50,784
many looks that I had written down in my notebook

168
00:04:50,784 --> 00:04:52,793
to work on but I'm always like filming all the time

169
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:54,546
and I'll open Instagram, and you'll post the most

170
00:04:54,546 --> 00:04:56,938
beautiful look and I'll be like I was gonna do that one!

171
00:04:56,938 --> 00:04:58,110
Like holy crap!

172
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:00,839
So I feel like you definitely have a very similar

173
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:02,545
style and mindset when it comes to makeup

174
00:05:02,545 --> 00:05:05,901
of like just creating a really beautiful like art pieces,

175
00:05:05,901 --> 00:05:08,188
and then Riquelle does literally some of the most

176
00:05:08,188 --> 00:05:11,566
insanely blended, like colorful looks

177
00:05:11,566 --> 00:05:13,308
I have ever seen in my entire life,

178
00:05:13,308 --> 00:05:15,920
like I feel like your work is just so immaculate

179
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,453
and you both have such an attention to detail

180
00:05:17,453 --> 00:05:18,370
it's really exciting - Thank you

181
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:21,934
watching both of you guys come into the industry.

182
00:05:21,934 --> 00:05:25,289
When did you guys actually start posting on Instagram?

183
00:05:25,289 --> 00:05:29,086
- So I think I started in like the summer of 2016,

184
00:05:29,086 --> 00:05:31,698
that's just when I started like, I don't know

185
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:33,567
I guess getting like good at makeup.

186
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,937
- Mhm, okay and Jake what about you?

187
00:05:34,937 --> 00:05:38,270
- I started posting like summer of 2017,

188
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:42,182
but at first the looks weren't even of mine,

189
00:05:42,182 --> 00:05:43,482
my sister would do my makeup.

190
00:05:43,482 --> 00:05:44,341
- Really?

191
00:05:44,341 --> 00:05:45,174
- Yeah.

192
00:05:45,174 --> 00:05:46,007
- Oh my god!

193
00:05:46,007 --> 00:05:48,231
- And then I just started playing with makeup,

194
00:05:48,231 --> 00:05:50,599
watching tutorials, obviously James' tutorials

195
00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:52,550
and then from there on I just started

196
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,419
being consistent, just started posting.

197
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:57,646
- So as like newcomers into the social media industry,

198
00:05:57,646 --> 00:05:59,516
what do you guys feel about the industry space right now,

199
00:05:59,516 --> 00:06:01,559
like what are your thoughts on the makeup community

200
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:03,010
and what do you feel about your experiences

201
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:03,843
and influencers so far?

202
00:06:03,843 --> 00:06:06,900
- I think it's pretty difficult just because

203
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:11,613
a lot of the smaller artists are kind of in on eachother,

204
00:06:11,613 --> 00:06:13,982
I personally feel like from personal experience

205
00:06:13,982 --> 00:06:18,428
so I try to stay secluded from a lot of the smaller artists

206
00:06:18,428 --> 00:06:23,107
so I like to keep to myself and I'm not like in it for

207
00:06:23,107 --> 00:06:25,510
anything else I just am here for the makeup

208
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,633
and for the artistry that comes with it.

209
00:06:28,633 --> 00:06:30,050
- Yeah, I really like that.

210
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:31,246
I definitely got involved with a lot of drama

211
00:06:31,246 --> 00:06:33,602
when I first started in the beauty community.

212
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:35,808
And I've since like obviously learned my lesson

213
00:06:35,808 --> 00:06:38,281
and there's literally no point and it's just such a headache

214
00:06:38,281 --> 00:06:40,534
so I definitely keep my circle very very small

215
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:43,320
and I'm like very happy with the circle that I do have.

216
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,469
What'd you say that having a following

217
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:47,221
and being an influencer is what you expected it would be?

218
00:06:47,221 --> 00:06:48,591
- Definitely not. - No.

219
00:06:48,591 --> 00:06:50,077
- Okay, why?

220
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:51,865
- First of all it's not as easy as I thought it would be.

221
00:06:51,865 --> 00:06:54,268
Like I thought people just like did their makeup,

222
00:06:54,268 --> 00:06:55,267
took pictures and like

223
00:06:55,267 --> 00:06:57,542
- Called it a day. - Got money, nope.

224
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:58,375
It's not that easy.

225
00:06:58,375 --> 00:06:59,208
- It's not.

226
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:00,990
- It's so stressful, especially cause I'm still

227
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,382
in high school, and you too - Me too.

228
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:05,541
- Yeah it's a lot to handle - It's hard to balance

229
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:07,062
On top of like schoolwork and everything.

230
00:07:07,062 --> 00:07:08,688
- Yeah cause they're two different worlds.

231
00:07:08,688 --> 00:07:10,383
- It's still like a really cool experience,

232
00:07:10,383 --> 00:07:12,519
to have the opportunity to do this.

233
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:14,481
- I'm guessing you barely even have time to film

234
00:07:14,481 --> 00:07:15,503
a lot of videos.

235
00:07:15,503 --> 00:07:17,291
- It's hard, I mean when I was in High School

236
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:20,286
I did make it work but it was literally like

237
00:07:20,286 --> 00:07:23,003
I would wake up every single morning at six in the morning,

238
00:07:23,003 --> 00:07:24,872
and then I would go to school until two,

239
00:07:24,872 --> 00:07:26,660
and then I would literally set up my little table

240
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,448
in the basement with my two soft boxes

241
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,863
and film a video for like three hours

242
00:07:30,863 --> 00:07:32,987
and I had to finish by like 5:50

243
00:07:32,987 --> 00:07:34,729
because I would have to wipe my makeup off

244
00:07:34,729 --> 00:07:37,318
and then drive to work at a frozen yogurt shop

245
00:07:37,318 --> 00:07:38,769
which was five minutes from my house,

246
00:07:38,769 --> 00:07:40,952
I had like 10 minutes to wipe it all off,

247
00:07:40,952 --> 00:07:43,622
take everything down, get my makeup off and drive there

248
00:07:43,622 --> 00:07:45,085
and clock in by six.

249
00:07:45,085 --> 00:07:47,918
Then I'd work usually from like six til 10 every night,

250
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:49,961
and then I'd have to close, then I'd get home

251
00:07:49,961 --> 00:07:52,585
and then I'd do my homework until like one or two.

252
00:07:52,585 --> 00:07:54,280
And then I'd go to bed and repeat.

253
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,752
And that was for like, a good like half a year in school.

254
00:07:57,752 --> 00:07:58,738
- Oh I don't think so.

255
00:07:58,738 --> 00:08:01,269
- Yeah it was definitely like, it was a lot

256
00:08:01,269 --> 00:08:02,732
and it was, I was getting very little sleep

257
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,265
and I got sick a lot, and it was not healthy.

258
00:08:04,265 --> 00:08:05,170
- You're also super motivated though.

259
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:07,086
- Yeah, but it's cause like I was really passionate

260
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:08,386
about it and I knew that I wanted to do it

261
00:08:08,386 --> 00:08:10,221
and I knew like I wanted to make it happen,

262
00:08:10,221 --> 00:08:12,508
and I also knew that I wanted to graduate early

263
00:08:12,508 --> 00:08:13,982
and that like I had to prove to my parents

264
00:08:13,982 --> 00:08:15,898
that I wanted it and that I was taking it seriously

265
00:08:15,898 --> 00:08:18,859
and that I wanted to have this be my full-time job as well.

266
00:08:18,859 --> 00:08:20,821
And if it were not for those sleepless nights

267
00:08:20,821 --> 00:08:22,446
I would not be here today, so.

268
00:08:22,446 --> 00:08:24,257
- But that's like also what inspires like me

269
00:08:24,257 --> 00:08:26,835
and a lot of people, like because you're so driven

270
00:08:26,835 --> 00:08:29,900
and to like what you wanna do inspires like me

271
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,362
and other people to do the same.

272
00:08:31,362 --> 00:08:32,477
- Aw, thank you.

273
00:08:32,477 --> 00:08:33,313
- Yeah. - Mhm.

274
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:34,845
- That means a lot thank you guys for saying that.

275
00:08:34,845 --> 00:08:36,134
Alright guys so we're gonna start off with an eyeshadow

276
00:08:36,134 --> 00:08:37,318
and of course we're going to be using the

277
00:08:37,318 --> 00:08:40,360
James Charles X Morphe Palette, mine is slightly busted

278
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,427
because I've been using this literally every single day

279
00:08:42,427 --> 00:08:44,284
but, let's jump right in.

280
00:08:44,284 --> 00:08:45,352
- Use code James for ten percent off.

281
00:08:45,352 --> 00:08:46,560
- Yeah. - Yes, thank you.

282
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,953
- I can't believe you forgot.

283
00:08:47,953 --> 00:08:51,227
- Sorry, well it's sister sold out everywhere, so.

284
00:08:51,227 --> 00:08:52,980
Maybe it will be back by the time this video goes up.

285
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,664
- I'm gonna dip into pinkity drinkity

286
00:08:54,664 --> 00:08:56,951
and just put this in the crease.

287
00:08:56,951 --> 00:08:58,332
- I love that, little valentines look.

288
00:08:58,332 --> 00:08:59,366
- Yes.

289
00:08:59,366 --> 00:09:00,863
- Oh yeah, highlighting his brow bone first.

290
00:09:00,863 --> 00:09:03,325
- Wait so are you guys on a lot of PR lists then?

291
00:09:03,325 --> 00:09:05,507
- I mean, I'm starting to get on a lot,

292
00:09:05,507 --> 00:09:07,655
but it's not like - It's like yeah but no.

293
00:09:07,655 --> 00:09:08,488
- Yeah.

294
00:09:08,488 --> 00:09:10,314
- Like I still wanna get onto ABH's.

295
00:09:10,314 --> 00:09:11,301
- Me too.

296
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:13,135
- Neither of you are on ABH yet?

297
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:13,968
- No.

298
00:09:13,968 --> 00:09:16,444
- Oh I'll be fixing that immediately.

299
00:09:16,444 --> 00:09:17,814
- Stop!

300
00:09:17,814 --> 00:09:20,194
- Gotchu girl, gotchu both.

301
00:09:20,194 --> 00:09:21,027
- Oh my god.

302
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:22,860
You do not understand.

303
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:25,813
- What?

304
00:09:25,813 --> 00:09:28,463
- How long I've been like, I was literally

305
00:09:28,463 --> 00:09:30,576
there was a time where I would literally like

306
00:09:30,576 --> 00:09:33,467
just go on their Instagram and scroll for hours

307
00:09:33,467 --> 00:09:34,710
and just see what they reposted

308
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:35,859
and just do that.

309
00:09:35,859 --> 00:09:36,692
- Yeah. - Yeah.

310
00:09:36,692 --> 00:09:38,796
- I was trying so hard just to get them to like my stuff

311
00:09:38,796 --> 00:09:40,422
like I would do neutral looks and stuff,

312
00:09:40,422 --> 00:09:41,676
and I hated neutrals.

313
00:09:41,676 --> 00:09:42,509
- Yeah. - Yeah.

314
00:09:42,509 --> 00:09:43,823
- I was like I just wanna be on their PR list.

315
00:09:43,823 --> 00:09:45,774
- ABH is on of the first PR lists I ever got on

316
00:09:45,774 --> 00:09:47,643
and they, working with them has been so incredible.

317
00:09:47,643 --> 00:09:48,967
So speaking of being on PR lists

318
00:09:48,967 --> 00:09:49,965
and getting brand deals and stuff,

319
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:51,904
there's definitely been a major shift in the industry

320
00:09:51,904 --> 00:09:54,725
this past year with like creators and coming and going

321
00:09:54,725 --> 00:09:56,594
and growing and stuff like that,

322
00:09:56,594 --> 00:09:58,255
how do you feel about the state that the industry is in

323
00:09:58,255 --> 00:10:00,472
right now when it comes to growing as a small creator

324
00:10:00,472 --> 00:10:02,643
and do you feel like it's easier or harder

325
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:03,978
to be recognized by these brands?

326
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:04,814
Like how do you feel?

327
00:10:04,814 --> 00:10:07,392
- I would say it's definitely like easier than it was

328
00:10:07,392 --> 00:10:10,097
maybe like two, three years ago cause just like

329
00:10:10,097 --> 00:10:12,976
the amount of people doing Instagram and makeup

330
00:10:12,976 --> 00:10:14,822
has definitely like gotten bigger.

331
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:16,204
- Yeah definitely.

332
00:10:16,204 --> 00:10:17,817
- So do you think that makes it easier?

333
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:18,828
- Didn't think of it that way.

334
00:10:18,828 --> 00:10:19,826
- I would say that it, yeah.

335
00:10:19,826 --> 00:10:21,219
- It does make it harder in terms of like

336
00:10:21,219 --> 00:10:22,682
getting yourself out there and

337
00:10:22,682 --> 00:10:26,954
trying to separate yourself from everybody else.

338
00:10:26,954 --> 00:10:28,394
- I agree in the sense that I do think it's getting

339
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:29,520
easier for smaller influencers

340
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,819
because of the fact that the community's growing so fast,

341
00:10:31,819 --> 00:10:34,188
but at the same time that also makes it so much harder

342
00:10:34,188 --> 00:10:36,068
because there's everybody there are to compete with

343
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:37,485
and you do really have to stand out.

344
00:10:37,485 --> 00:10:39,029
- Mhm for sure. - Yeah.

345
00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:40,573
And I think we're moving in the right direction

346
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:43,638
when it comes to like diversity and showing inclusivity

347
00:10:43,638 --> 00:10:46,506
in the beauty community, but like there's definitely

348
00:10:46,506 --> 00:10:48,746
a long way to go when it comes to like posting

349
00:10:48,746 --> 00:10:50,453
people of color, - Absolutely

350
00:10:50,453 --> 00:10:53,031
and people of like different economic backgrounds

351
00:10:53,031 --> 00:10:53,948
and everything like that.

352
00:10:53,948 --> 00:10:54,781
- Yeah.

353
00:10:54,781 --> 00:10:57,198
- One other thing I've noticed is also that

354
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,764
brands don't necessarily just pay attention to

355
00:10:59,764 --> 00:11:02,783
people that do neutral looks or warm smoky eyes

356
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:05,233
and all that, like I'm so happy that these brands

357
00:11:05,233 --> 00:11:07,903
are finally noticing all these creative people,

358
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:10,712
people that do all of these out of the box things,

359
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:13,081
tutorial makeup, and not just like the same stuff

360
00:11:13,081 --> 00:11:14,161
over and over again. - Yeah.

361
00:11:14,161 --> 00:11:17,214
There was a time when I would just be like,

362
00:11:17,214 --> 00:11:20,117
really mad over like not being reposted and stuff,

363
00:11:20,117 --> 00:11:22,659
but like once I actually thought about it I'm like,

364
00:11:22,659 --> 00:11:25,190
if I want this to happen I actually have to work for it

365
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:27,083
and not just like think that just because

366
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:28,290
I'm suddenly getting followers like

367
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,370
everything's gonna happen - And it's not an overnight

368
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:30,203
thing.

369
00:11:30,203 --> 00:11:31,036
- Yeah, exactly.

370
00:11:31,036 --> 00:11:32,841
- Right, I think that is a very good point.

371
00:11:32,841 --> 00:11:33,874
I definitely used to be very bitter

372
00:11:33,874 --> 00:11:35,035
when I first started as well,

373
00:11:35,035 --> 00:11:36,278
and I think it's also important to know too

374
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:37,682
and you mentioned this earlier

375
00:11:37,682 --> 00:11:39,006
before we were even filming you said that

376
00:11:39,006 --> 00:11:41,723
when you first started you had an attitude with people

377
00:11:41,723 --> 00:11:42,710
- Oh my god.

378
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,207
- Talk about that for a minute.

379
00:11:44,207 --> 00:11:45,496
- Yeah I can touch on that, yeah.

380
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,702
So in general I have like an attitude

381
00:11:47,702 --> 00:11:50,755
and I can be kind of like, what's the word?

382
00:11:50,755 --> 00:11:51,928
- Blunt.

383
00:11:51,928 --> 00:11:54,389
- Yeah, yeah, blunt and like very honest.

384
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:55,222
- Yeah.

385
00:11:55,222 --> 00:11:57,988
- So, I kind of come across as like rude sometimes.

386
00:11:57,988 --> 00:12:01,529
Really early on I had to like realize that everything

387
00:12:01,529 --> 00:12:03,457
you say and do can be taken out of context,

388
00:12:03,457 --> 00:12:05,465
people can misinterpret things all the time,

389
00:12:05,465 --> 00:12:07,427
so you kinda have to really be aware

390
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:08,913
of the image you're presenting.

391
00:12:08,913 --> 00:12:10,388
- I think too like I definitely do see a lot of

392
00:12:10,388 --> 00:12:12,094
small artists that are really talented and

393
00:12:12,094 --> 00:12:13,906
absolutely killing it but maybe don't have the best

394
00:12:13,906 --> 00:12:16,518
attitudes online when it comes to interacting with others

395
00:12:16,518 --> 00:12:18,642
or with brands, I know ABH just had a scandal

396
00:12:18,642 --> 00:12:21,139
a few weeks ago where they posted on their Instagram

397
00:12:21,139 --> 00:12:23,844
asking for people to tag different people in the comments

398
00:12:23,844 --> 00:12:24,703
to be added - Oh I remember that

399
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,560
to their PR list and one girl asked her followers

400
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,602
to comment on ABH's thing, and when her name was being

401
00:12:29,602 --> 00:12:31,739
spammed in the comments, sometimes Instagram will mark

402
00:12:31,739 --> 00:12:34,734
that as spam, and then she literally started a whole rumor

403
00:12:34,734 --> 00:12:36,731
that Anastasia hated Hispanic people.

404
00:12:36,731 --> 00:12:40,283
Like of all brands, Anastasia, who has done so much

405
00:12:40,283 --> 00:12:41,630
for the community.

406
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,942
I was like oh, absolutely not.

407
00:12:42,942 --> 00:12:45,287
But I think it's that level of entitlement

408
00:12:45,287 --> 00:12:48,027
that I think is the issue it's like aside from the whole

409
00:12:48,027 --> 00:12:49,362
comment being deleted thing I think it's crazy

410
00:12:49,362 --> 00:12:51,441
that instead of just thinking twice and being like

411
00:12:51,441 --> 00:12:53,519
what could of actually happened here,

412
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,957
the rationale went right to oh this brand is racist,

413
00:12:55,957 --> 00:12:58,198
they hate Hispanic people they're not reposting me.

414
00:12:58,198 --> 00:13:01,866
It's crazy and I think that mentality's something that

415
00:13:01,866 --> 00:13:03,701
a lot of artists have and it's selfish

416
00:13:03,701 --> 00:13:05,895
and it's entitlement and I think like you said

417
00:13:05,895 --> 00:13:06,917
- And if you wanna get somewhere

418
00:13:06,917 --> 00:13:09,773
- And if you get somewhere, yeah everybody's watching.

419
00:13:09,773 --> 00:13:12,014
Both fans are watching and of course drama is entertaining

420
00:13:12,014 --> 00:13:14,115
every once in a while but for the most part,

421
00:13:14,115 --> 00:13:16,472
nobody wants to watch somebody get in fights all day long

422
00:13:16,472 --> 00:13:17,865
and start things and attack others,

423
00:13:17,865 --> 00:13:19,653
and also the brands are watching.

424
00:13:19,653 --> 00:13:21,464
And if you're sitting there fighting and leaving comments

425
00:13:21,464 --> 00:13:23,438
on a brand's post and starting scandals like that,

426
00:13:23,438 --> 00:13:25,214
nobody's gonna wanna work with you because you're

427
00:13:25,214 --> 00:13:26,979
unreliable and who knows what you could say about

428
00:13:26,979 --> 00:13:28,883
another brand later on.

429
00:13:28,883 --> 00:13:29,870
You do definitely have to be careful

430
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:31,692
and I'm glad that you learned that lesson early on,

431
00:13:31,692 --> 00:13:33,225
I think it's really dope that you were able to actually

432
00:13:33,225 --> 00:13:35,860
self-reflect and like learn from that.

433
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:36,693
- Yeah!

434
00:13:36,693 --> 00:13:37,526
- Yeah.

435
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:38,484
- I'm gonna use this, okay what is this brush

436
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,377
because I've been looking for this.

437
00:13:40,377 --> 00:13:42,757
- I don't know but I love it though.

438
00:13:42,757 --> 00:13:44,507
- It's a Morphe M554.

439
00:13:45,369 --> 00:13:46,367
And you've never done this.

440
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,645
- Wait so what are you doing?

441
00:13:47,645 --> 00:13:49,641
- I like to put it in there to brighten.

442
00:13:49,641 --> 00:13:50,474
- Canvas.

443
00:13:50,474 --> 00:13:51,307
- Yes.

444
00:13:51,307 --> 00:13:52,140
- From the palette?

445
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,624
- Yes, I do it all the time.

446
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:54,457
- Wait really?

447
00:13:54,457 --> 00:13:55,290
- You don't do that?

448
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,873
- It's like peachy.

449
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:00,833
- No but the thing is, like it doesn't come off that peachy.

450
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:02,296
- Wait that doesn't look like.

451
00:14:02,296 --> 00:14:03,190
(gasps)

452
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:04,189
- That looks so pretty.

453
00:14:04,189 --> 00:14:05,338
- I'm sorry, what?

454
00:14:05,338 --> 00:14:06,836
It looks like it would be so much more like,

455
00:14:06,836 --> 00:14:07,669
- Orange.

456
00:14:07,669 --> 00:14:08,502
- Pinkish.

457
00:14:08,502 --> 00:14:10,087
- Well because when you swatch it and in the pan

458
00:14:10,087 --> 00:14:11,480
it does look peachy,

459
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,362
- I was about to use my knuckle.

460
00:14:12,362 --> 00:14:13,395
- But then it doesn't really.

461
00:14:13,395 --> 00:14:14,228
- Yeah.

462
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,061
- You know?

463
00:14:15,061 --> 00:14:15,894
- I've never done that before.

464
00:14:15,894 --> 00:14:17,331
- I do it on everyone.

465
00:14:17,331 --> 00:14:18,864
I like to brighten it under the eye,

466
00:14:18,864 --> 00:14:21,372
especially if I do a lower lash line,

467
00:14:21,372 --> 00:14:22,892
you want that to be bright.

468
00:14:22,892 --> 00:14:25,331
- When I did my full face of makeup using only my palette,

469
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:26,968
I did no foundation at first because I didn't think

470
00:14:26,968 --> 00:14:27,954
I was gonna have a shade,

471
00:14:27,954 --> 00:14:30,857
but then at the end I started using canvas all over,

472
00:14:30,857 --> 00:14:32,738
and it looks really good for foundation but I never

473
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:33,736
thought to use it - See how brightened it is?

474
00:14:33,736 --> 00:14:34,569
- Yeah!

475
00:14:34,569 --> 00:14:38,032
What has been your guys biggest accomplishments so far

476
00:14:38,032 --> 00:14:40,470
in the beauty industry since you guys started?

477
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:41,303
- This.

478
00:14:42,223 --> 00:14:43,056
- This.

479
00:14:43,056 --> 00:14:43,889
- Really?

480
00:14:43,889 --> 00:14:44,722
- This!

481
00:14:44,722 --> 00:14:45,555
Duh!

482
00:14:45,555 --> 00:14:46,388
- Are you serious?

483
00:14:46,388 --> 00:14:48,005
- Yeah cause honestly - Yes!

484
00:14:48,005 --> 00:14:50,292
- Oh my god what the heck!

485
00:14:50,292 --> 00:14:52,289
- Yeah. - Yeah.

486
00:14:52,289 --> 00:14:54,785
- Like for me it's like it went from like fan to

487
00:14:54,785 --> 00:14:56,596
literally like being your friend.

488
00:14:56,596 --> 00:14:57,429
- Yeah.

489
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:59,638
- Which is like so crazy, and like I never thought

490
00:14:59,638 --> 00:15:01,716
I'd literally be here with you.

491
00:15:01,716 --> 00:15:04,584
Like we never get to talk like actual friends and stuff.

492
00:15:04,584 --> 00:15:06,825
- I know same, literally the exact same.

493
00:15:06,825 --> 00:15:07,939
- Aw that's so cool.

494
00:15:07,939 --> 00:15:09,553
- I never imagined any of this to happen.

495
00:15:09,553 --> 00:15:11,457
- Like I went to watching beauty gurus,

496
00:15:11,457 --> 00:15:12,583
and now we're like - Yeah

497
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:14,859
slowly but surely becoming one.

498
00:15:14,859 --> 00:15:16,983
- Isn't it cool because that's kind of like how I was.

499
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:18,516
Not as much of a beauty guru, but like in the YouTube

500
00:15:18,516 --> 00:15:19,349
community in general.

501
00:15:19,349 --> 00:15:21,209
Like I was a fan of so many of the beauty gurus

502
00:15:21,209 --> 00:15:22,870
but I also watched so many other youtubers

503
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:25,459
that it's been like so cool to meet in person now too.

504
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:29,046
- Oh yeah, so recently, not recently, no actually

505
00:15:29,046 --> 00:15:32,425
it was like months ago, James invited me to be part

506
00:15:32,425 --> 00:15:35,385
of his campaign for the Morphe palette collab.

507
00:15:35,385 --> 00:15:36,218
- Oh yeah!

508
00:15:36,218 --> 00:15:37,051
People don't even know about that!

509
00:15:37,051 --> 00:15:41,051
- No yeah, so it was, you filmed it twice right?

510
00:15:42,247 --> 00:15:44,998
- Yeah so the sisters know that I filmed the Morphe Campaign

511
00:15:44,998 --> 00:15:46,391
actually twice I talked about that before

512
00:15:46,391 --> 00:15:47,610
but I never really mentioned I don't think

513
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:48,911
what it was the first time.

514
00:15:48,911 --> 00:15:49,744
- Yeah.

515
00:15:49,744 --> 00:15:50,722
- And the photos are actually on the website

516
00:15:50,722 --> 00:15:51,555
so a few people did

517
00:15:51,555 --> 00:15:52,388
catch on - Okay, yeah.

518
00:15:52,388 --> 00:15:53,833
The first time we actually filmed it,

519
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:56,608
I was only in the last shot, which was like the picture

520
00:15:56,608 --> 00:15:58,861
that made it to the palette but every other color

521
00:15:58,861 --> 00:16:01,542
of the palette was assigned to a different friend or artist

522
00:16:01,542 --> 00:16:03,017
that I have looked up to for a long time,

523
00:16:03,017 --> 00:16:05,211
so my mom was in it, Ethan and Grayson were in it,

524
00:16:05,211 --> 00:16:06,767
Jake was in it, a few different artists from Twitter

525
00:16:06,767 --> 00:16:08,044
and Instagram that I've been following forever

526
00:16:08,044 --> 00:16:08,877
were in it as well,

527
00:16:08,877 --> 00:16:11,341
Briquelle, literally flew all the way from Australia

528
00:16:11,341 --> 00:16:13,582
to be in it, my literal favorite artist of all time.

529
00:16:13,582 --> 00:16:14,415
- Same.

530
00:16:14,415 --> 00:16:16,519
- Unfortunately the footage wasn't high resolution enough

531
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:17,773
to be used in commercial format,

532
00:16:17,773 --> 00:16:19,886
so we literally had to redo the entire thing

533
00:16:19,886 --> 00:16:23,427
which sucked, but regardless we still got amazing photos

534
00:16:23,427 --> 00:16:25,366
of it, it was an amazing day.

535
00:16:25,366 --> 00:16:27,630
- Yes, it was just so fun to have like so many artists

536
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:30,591
in a room and just like such positive energy.

537
00:16:30,591 --> 00:16:31,424
- Yeah.

538
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:33,400
- It was my first time ever doing any photo shoot

539
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,107
and it was for a big brand too.

540
00:16:35,107 --> 00:16:35,940
- Yeah.

541
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,963
- So being there really meant a lot to me.

542
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:38,796
- Aw!

543
00:16:38,796 --> 00:16:39,629
- Thank you so much.

544
00:16:39,629 --> 00:16:40,726
- Of course sister!

545
00:16:40,726 --> 00:16:41,559
Okay what are you using?

546
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:43,269
- I'm using face,

547
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:44,209
- Same. As a highlighter.

548
00:16:44,209 --> 00:16:45,347
- Love that.

549
00:16:45,347 --> 00:16:46,180
Oh yeah.

550
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,924
I feel like I've asked you guys quite a few questions

551
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:50,328
now about like your experience in the beauty industry but,

552
00:16:50,328 --> 00:16:53,009
do you guys have any questions that I could answer for you

553
00:16:53,009 --> 00:16:55,517
about being an influencer and what it's like

554
00:16:55,517 --> 00:16:57,003
and like how the behind the scenes work

555
00:16:57,003 --> 00:16:59,105
or how like literally anything?

556
00:16:59,105 --> 00:16:59,938
- Yeah,

557
00:16:59,938 --> 00:17:01,032
- Cause I'm here, always.

558
00:17:01,032 --> 00:17:03,540
As a resource, and a friend, and somebody to be there,

559
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,685
and somebody whose experienced it all,

560
00:17:04,685 --> 00:17:05,893
and whose learned the hard way.

561
00:17:05,893 --> 00:17:06,726
- Yeah.

562
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:08,203
- And I feel like I'm always down to like help everybody out

563
00:17:08,203 --> 00:17:09,770
I feel like when I first came in,

564
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:11,860
there weren't many people that were willing to give me

565
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:13,834
honest answers and help me out but like

566
00:17:13,834 --> 00:17:15,877
I wanna be that person for everybody else

567
00:17:15,877 --> 00:17:16,957
who I really believe in,

568
00:17:16,957 --> 00:17:19,314
so if you guys have any questions for me,

569
00:17:19,314 --> 00:17:21,044
I'd love to answer and I'm sure for anybody at home

570
00:17:21,044 --> 00:17:23,621
that's aspiring as well would love to know, so.

571
00:17:23,621 --> 00:17:27,704
- Well I have struggled with responding to emails

572
00:17:28,706 --> 00:17:30,599
when I get asked about ratings.

573
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:32,178
- Oh like rates, money.

574
00:17:32,178 --> 00:17:36,113
- So I think that would be cool to know, and

575
00:17:36,113 --> 00:17:37,054
- Like how to charge.

576
00:17:37,054 --> 00:17:38,099
- Yeah.

577
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:40,432
- Touchy subject, but definitely down to talk about it.

578
00:17:40,432 --> 00:17:43,126
I feel like rates are very very controversial

579
00:17:43,126 --> 00:17:45,146
in the sense that, we had the whole situation last year

580
00:17:45,146 --> 00:17:47,259
with Marlena talking about influencer rates

581
00:17:47,259 --> 00:17:50,185
and when 60,000 dollars was dropped and everybody like

582
00:17:50,185 --> 00:17:51,450
went crazy but in reality,

583
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:54,968
60,000 isn't like a lot of money for the influencer space.

584
00:17:54,968 --> 00:17:57,545
It really did turn into a witch hunt against influencers

585
00:17:57,545 --> 00:18:00,459
and I definitely did react very harshly first

586
00:18:00,459 --> 00:18:02,329
but Marlena and I did talk behind the scenes

587
00:18:02,329 --> 00:18:05,053
but regardless, I think it one turned into a witch hunt

588
00:18:05,053 --> 00:18:06,911
because people heard that and they assumed that

589
00:18:06,911 --> 00:18:08,629
everybody was charging 60,000 dollars

590
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,243
which is definitely not the case.

591
00:18:10,243 --> 00:18:12,518
And I think it's important to know that everybody's rates

592
00:18:12,518 --> 00:18:14,829
are different depending on what they offer.

593
00:18:14,829 --> 00:18:15,662
- Literally everybody, yeah.

594
00:18:15,662 --> 00:18:18,463
- Because not only are the paying for of course like

595
00:18:18,463 --> 00:18:20,552
the followers number is there but at the end of the day,

596
00:18:20,552 --> 00:18:22,375
what you should be charging for, and what brands should be

597
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:23,919
paying for is the engagement.

598
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,452
Because you can have five million followers

599
00:18:25,452 --> 00:18:26,984
and be getting 30,000 likes.

600
00:18:26,984 --> 00:18:30,560
That person should be charging a fraction of what

601
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,814
somebody with 5 million followers that's getting

602
00:18:31,814 --> 00:18:32,647
a million likes should be.

603
00:18:32,647 --> 00:18:33,480
Because those people do exist.

604
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,332
I feel like demographic is also a super important thing

605
00:18:35,332 --> 00:18:37,874
as well because like you can be like a 15 year old boy

606
00:18:37,874 --> 00:18:41,497
in makeup, but like if a sports brand reaches out,

607
00:18:41,497 --> 00:18:43,319
the chances are it's not really gonna be a good fit

608
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:45,885
for you because the chances are our followers are mostly

609
00:18:45,885 --> 00:18:47,081
young girls that might not be interested in

610
00:18:47,081 --> 00:18:48,869
- Sports - that type of stuff.

611
00:18:48,869 --> 00:18:50,889
I feel like the best way to go about it is

612
00:18:50,889 --> 00:18:53,327
talk to other people in the community for sure,

613
00:18:53,327 --> 00:18:54,349
like I said it is a community

614
00:18:54,349 --> 00:18:55,626
and it's important to treat it that way

615
00:18:55,626 --> 00:18:57,066
and to communicate with your fellow artists

616
00:18:57,066 --> 00:18:58,389
and see what else is going on,

617
00:18:58,389 --> 00:19:00,932
and also two, like it's important because

618
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:03,080
unfortunately a lot of brands do try to take advantage,

619
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,274
especially of smaller artists who are kind of like new

620
00:19:05,274 --> 00:19:07,352
to the game and don't really have others to talk to,

621
00:19:07,352 --> 00:19:09,953
and they'll try to underpay and the unfortunate reality

622
00:19:09,953 --> 00:19:13,238
is a lot of these brands don't wanna pay, even period,

623
00:19:13,238 --> 00:19:15,084
which is horrible because no matter what it is

624
00:19:15,084 --> 00:19:16,849
you should always be paid for doing work,

625
00:19:16,849 --> 00:19:18,045
so it's just a very tricky subject

626
00:19:18,045 --> 00:19:19,415
but it's also up to the influencer too

627
00:19:19,415 --> 00:19:21,783
to know your worth and not be afraid to negotiate,

628
00:19:21,783 --> 00:19:25,510
but also understand what the offer is too

629
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:27,170
because sometimes a major brand can be reaching out

630
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:29,992
and I'll see influencers negotiate for thousands and

631
00:19:29,992 --> 00:19:31,768
thousands and thousands of dollars, when I'm like

632
00:19:31,768 --> 00:19:33,626
your engagement isn't even that good one, and two

633
00:19:33,626 --> 00:19:34,961
this is a really great opportunity.

634
00:19:34,961 --> 00:19:37,805
Some things are just good learning experiences too so,

635
00:19:37,805 --> 00:19:40,092
it's really important to just like kinda talk to others

636
00:19:40,092 --> 00:19:42,902
and talk to role models around you and talk to your parents

637
00:19:42,902 --> 00:19:45,096
and people who know and have a had a little bit more

638
00:19:45,096 --> 00:19:46,513
experience and get that type of help

639
00:19:46,513 --> 00:19:48,544
because I'd so much rather have people be

640
00:19:48,544 --> 00:19:50,657
safe than sorry and know what's going on

641
00:19:50,657 --> 00:19:52,283
rather than potentially sign a contract

642
00:19:52,283 --> 00:19:55,011
and get way screwed over later on.

643
00:19:55,011 --> 00:19:56,416
- Yeah so I'm gonna be doing like some little

644
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:58,738
heart freckles, like inverted ones,

645
00:19:58,738 --> 00:19:59,945
so they're like blended out.

646
00:19:59,945 --> 00:20:01,188
- Love that.

647
00:20:01,188 --> 00:20:02,021
- Yeah.

648
00:20:02,021 --> 00:20:02,854
- Okay, great.

649
00:20:02,854 --> 00:20:03,753
For a little Valentine's Day Moment.

650
00:20:03,753 --> 00:20:04,586
Okay.

651
00:20:04,586 --> 00:20:08,615
- So, I'm gonna be stacking two pairs of lashes together

652
00:20:08,615 --> 00:20:11,645
so I don't know they can look more dramatic.

653
00:20:11,645 --> 00:20:13,177
- Okay, I'm so down. - Like Mine.

654
00:20:13,177 --> 00:20:15,372
So the lashes I'm stacking are

655
00:20:15,372 --> 00:20:17,055
- Lilly, so extra Miami's.

656
00:20:17,055 --> 00:20:18,669
Use code James for 15% off.

657
00:20:18,669 --> 00:20:21,409
- And then I'm also using that bitch by Crvstal Lashes.

658
00:20:21,409 --> 00:20:23,464
- Oh and what I like about this is it totally looks like

659
00:20:23,464 --> 00:20:24,904
our looks like on him.

660
00:20:24,904 --> 00:20:25,890
- Yeah. - Yeah.

661
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,390
- Like, holy shit.

662
00:20:28,224 --> 00:20:29,269
- Does this look like something I would do?

663
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:30,102
- Yes!

664
00:20:30,102 --> 00:20:30,935
- Yes!

665
00:20:30,935 --> 00:20:33,704
- It looks like you would post like a sunset picture

666
00:20:33,704 --> 00:20:35,016
like just the eye.

667
00:20:35,016 --> 00:20:36,966
- With a good, approximately

668
00:20:36,966 --> 00:20:38,510
- Yeah, right there.

669
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,625
- Just crop right there.

670
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:40,458
Lip time.

671
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:41,390
- Lip time.

672
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:43,015
- What liner are you using?

673
00:20:43,015 --> 00:20:46,591
- I'm using Curvii by iluvsarahii x ColourPop

674
00:20:46,591 --> 00:20:47,555
- Literally my favorite one.

675
00:20:47,555 --> 00:20:49,261
- Me too, you got me on this one.

676
00:20:49,261 --> 00:20:50,132
- Love that.

677
00:20:50,132 --> 00:20:52,048
- I feel like it can be used on any skin tone.

678
00:20:52,048 --> 00:20:52,881
- Yes.

679
00:20:52,881 --> 00:20:55,728
- Which I like about this, it's very versatile.

680
00:20:55,728 --> 00:20:57,156
- Wait was that the right word? Versatile?

681
00:20:57,156 --> 00:20:57,989
- Yeah.

682
00:20:57,989 --> 00:20:58,967
- Okay I'm using some big words today.

683
00:20:58,967 --> 00:20:59,800
(laughs)

684
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,614
I'm two years old.

685
00:21:01,614 --> 00:21:03,031
- What are we doing for lips?

686
00:21:03,031 --> 00:21:04,807
- I'm gonna do

687
00:21:04,807 --> 00:21:07,860
- Wait so should we do different on each side or the same?

688
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:08,778
- Up to you.

689
00:21:08,778 --> 00:21:09,939
Do you wanna do a matching nude?

690
00:21:09,939 --> 00:21:12,086
That could kinda be cute guys like the color would

691
00:21:12,086 --> 00:21:13,213
look good with both looks.

692
00:21:13,213 --> 00:21:14,046
- Yeah.

693
00:21:14,046 --> 00:21:14,879
- Yeah, okay.

694
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,521
- Wait do you both mutually agree

695
00:21:16,521 --> 00:21:18,426
on this selection of this fun gloss?

696
00:21:18,426 --> 00:21:19,494
- Oh let me see, yeah.

697
00:21:19,494 --> 00:21:20,980
- Fun gloss. - Wait okay I picked out,

698
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,837
- Riquelle picked out four options for everybody.

699
00:21:22,837 --> 00:21:24,857
- So we have wait should we go through all of them

700
00:21:24,857 --> 00:21:25,879
or is that doing too much?

701
00:21:25,879 --> 00:21:27,493
- What gloss is this?

702
00:21:27,493 --> 00:21:28,642
- That's a Katy Dose of Colors.

703
00:21:28,642 --> 00:21:29,513
- Yeah! - I love that.

704
00:21:29,513 --> 00:21:31,336
- You have Dose of Colors, also in the most,

705
00:21:31,336 --> 00:21:35,074
we have Anastasia in pearl, and then Kylie in

706
00:21:35,074 --> 00:21:35,968
- Always shining.

707
00:21:35,968 --> 00:21:36,801
- Love that.

708
00:21:36,801 --> 00:21:37,698
- Shinin, shinin

709
00:21:37,698 --> 00:21:39,649
- Shinin, I was gonna do that too!

710
00:21:39,649 --> 00:21:43,085
Shinin, shinin, shinin, shinin, yeah

711
00:21:43,085 --> 00:21:44,258
- So you can sing and I can't?

712
00:21:44,258 --> 00:21:45,651
- Well that's not, singing so.

713
00:21:45,651 --> 00:21:46,484
- I can sing.

714
00:21:46,484 --> 00:21:47,317
- You can?

715
00:21:47,317 --> 00:21:49,389
- Mhm, but I have stage fright so no more singing.

716
00:21:49,389 --> 00:21:50,307
- Oh, how rude.

717
00:21:50,307 --> 00:21:51,140
- I'll sing once you stop filming.

718
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,454
- Okay, okay which one?

719
00:21:52,454 --> 00:21:56,367
- Okay I'm stuck between that one and I like the

720
00:21:56,367 --> 00:21:57,354
pearlescent one

721
00:21:57,354 --> 00:21:59,037
- Wait what?

722
00:21:59,037 --> 00:21:59,870
- That one, yeah.

723
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:00,703
- This one?

724
00:22:00,703 --> 00:22:01,536
I think this would look really stunning.

725
00:22:01,536 --> 00:22:03,519
- Yeah just because I feel like that's too like,

726
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:04,540
- Cause this would go with my side

727
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,574
but I don't know if it would go with yours

728
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:06,407
- Yeah.

729
00:22:06,407 --> 00:22:07,240
- Cause yours is more pinky.

730
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,639
- So wait, you said this one?

731
00:22:08,639 --> 00:22:11,123
- Yeah, just a dollop of daisy.

732
00:22:11,123 --> 00:22:14,142
- There we go, so we're done with the lips,

733
00:22:14,142 --> 00:22:14,975
and there.
