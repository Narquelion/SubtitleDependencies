1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:00,960
Yes.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:02,180
It is true.

3
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:06,600
I lost the presidential election in 2012 to Mr. Barack Obama.

4
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,660
But that is only because I thought the world was ending.

5
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:14,860
So I withdrew from the election and hid under a rock on top of me.

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,520
But now in 2016,

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,960
It is finally time for me to formally annouce to the country,

8
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:22,060
No, the world.

9
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,580
No, the entire city!

10
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:27,980
That I, Ryan Higa, will once again be running

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,700
Four (for) kilometers down the road to the registrations office,

12
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,880
Where I will fill out all my information,

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,160
To run for president, again!

14
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,900
No, thank you for having me.

15
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,660
Hi, I'm Ryan Higa.

16
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:56,020
And today I'm going to show you how easy it is to run for president by example.

17
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,400
After 5 simple lessons, you'll have all the tools necessary to run for president.

18
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,340
Including your own campaign slogan.

19
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,440
Which in my opinion is the most important part.

20
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,800
You know which slogans I'm talking about.

21
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,300
Hillary Clinton has "Fighting for us".

22
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,420
Donald Trump says "Make America great again.

23
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:09,920
As for myself, I don't have one yet.

24
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,560
But by the end of this video, not only will I have a good campaign slogan,

25
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,560
But a slogan that is better than all the other candidates' slogans put together

26
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,500
So let's get started.

27
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,800
The first lesson in running for president:

28
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,500
You gotta be able to answer all the tough questions.

29
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,800
For me, answering tough questions is nothing new.

30
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,260
Not only have I answered tough questions.

31
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,300
I've answered some of life's toughest questions.

32
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:27,980
Such as

33
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,460
They were both first the chicken was inside of the egg.

34
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:33,080
Yes, Justin, it is in fact too late to say you are sorry.

35
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,040
No, no, no. The sum is 19.

36
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,700
Unless you're 19 and you still think 21 is a funny answer.

37
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,020
No, Frozen 2 does not come out for another 2 years.

38
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,900
Well, yes. It does make you look a little fat.

39
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,560
What, you asked for honesty.

40
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,500
Wh- Why would you even ask me if you expected a certain answer ?

41
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,400
We're just going to the movie theatres why do you even need a dress in the first place ?

42
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,080
Can we please just go ?

43
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:54,760
Thank you !

44
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,720
Now what do you wanna go see ?

45
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,680
I just told you it doesn't come out for 2 years, Justin !

46
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,780
Now that you can answer all the tough questions,

47
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,160
You are now ready for lesson 2.

48
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,500
Addressing the big issues.

49
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,000
Every election, candidates are always asked about the same big issues.

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,280
Education, gun control, North Korea.

51
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,400
All you have to do is talk about those big issues

52
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,700
And give your very own solutions.

53
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,900
The current "no child left behind" act pushes struggling kids forward

54
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,620
And I personally think that is absolutely immoral and wrong.

55
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,240
When there's someone in your group who is slow or disadvantaged

56
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,040
And they're falling behind you and your group

57
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,560
Do you go and push that member forward ?

58
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,680
Absolutely not ! You slow down and you wait for them

59
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,180
Because that's what's right

60
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:35,920
I plan to abolish the no child left behind act and establish the no child running ahead act

61
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,080
Where we will never push a struggling student

62
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,300
Instead we will slow down the ones that excell

63
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,100
Not only will we protect South Korea

64
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,120
But East and West Korea as well

65
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,900
And every other direction in between

66
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,740
We're still not sure which side North East Korea is on

67
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,960
But thank's to my future vice president Kanye

68
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,980
We know that we have North West on our side

69
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,020
Some people believe that guns kill people

70
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,120
Others believe that people kill people

71
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,720
But I've always believed that people kill guns

72
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,460
And just like pets have protection with PETA

73
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,180
I plan to start Gunna

74
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,320
Where you can have a gun

75
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,620
But if you abuse it in any way

76
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,960
We're gunna kill you

77
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,860
Every good politician knows that if you make the people afraid of something

78
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:20,880
They'll look to you to fix it

79
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,620
Look at what Donald Trump did for example

80
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,400
With all the recent bombings and terrorism going on

81
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,860
He made the people fear muslims

82
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,500
And Donald Trump says he wants to ban all the muslims from our country

83
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,320
Now I completely disagree with that but I do believe in freedom of speech

84
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,180
So when I become president Donald Trump can still say whatever he wants

85
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,420
But I'm going to make it mandatory for him to have a muzzle on

86
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,560
That's right we are going to muzzle him

87
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,260
And he will henceforth be known as a muzzle-im

88
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,260
You see what Trump did wrong is that banning all muslims is unrealistic

89
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,360
The fear that you introduce needs to be something believable

90
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,640
Something the people can relate to

91
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,520
Something real

92
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,300
Washing machines ! Not everyone has one

93
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,680
But for the ones that do

94
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,180
I'm here to tell you

95
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:56,500
That in 2017 all washing machines will come to life

96
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,240
And there will be a war

97
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:00,160
Not just for America but all of humanity

98
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,460
And I know this because I am from the future

99
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,700
Even if you can't keep them you have to make promises of things you would change if you become president

100
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,420
And these promises just need to be things that everybody would be happy with

101
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,020
All future award shows will be only hosted by Steve Harvey

102
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,860
Anyone who says the word Hello

103
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:22,000
Will no longer be able to follow it up with "it's me" or "I was wondering"

104
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,320
Anyone who writes articles that list things

105
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,140
Must put the entire list on that one page

106
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,780
Rather than putting a bunch of the things listed on different pages

107
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,760
So you have to keep clicking "next page"

108
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,840
All sports will be renamed more accurately to what they look like

109
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,760
Basketball shall be known as bouncy oranges

110
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,800
American footbal shall be called organic egg toss

111
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,960
Tennis will be known as spiderweb slapstick

112
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,040
And most importantly

113
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,880
International football or American soccer

114
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,340
Will no longer be called either

115
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,300
But instead a combination of the two names football and soccer

116
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,600
Put together to create a more accurate title

117
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,400
Known as flopper

118
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,960
Can we get somebody to fix that fireplace ?

119
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,300
There we go.

120
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,740
And last, but not least:

121
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,460
Your campaign.

122
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:16,520
Now this is probably the most important one because this is what wins the elections

123
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,180
It doesn't really matter what you plan to do or what you plan to change if you have a good campaign

124
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,260
And most importantly - I've mentionned it before:

125
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,040
You gotta have a good slogan

126
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,000
I can fix it

127
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,720
From hope to higher ground

128
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,400
I am fighting for you democrats

129
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,780
Make America great again

130
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,380
My name is Ryan Higa

131
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,800
And today I need all of you

132
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,780
To help me

133
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:03,880
Find

134
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:04,680
My

135
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,040
Speech !

136
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,800
It's uh- I think it may have fell out of my pocket on the way in

137
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,220
So the front row if you guys could check

138
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,700
I actually can't start without it so if you guys could all pitch in

139
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,000
We could do this a lot quicker

140
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,160
Anyone ?

141
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:17,980
I found it !

142
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,880
See ? Wouldn't want to be choking on this

143
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,060
Can't be president if I'm dead right ?

144
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,920
Alright, where were we ?

145
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,460
Yes, I may have lost the presidential election in 2012

146
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:45,040
And yes, I may have lost the Teen Choice awards in 2015

147
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:50,880
And yes, I may have even lost my iPhone in an Uber 2 weeks ago

148
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,880
But there is one thing I will not lose

149
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,380
This election !

150
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:02,460
I know there's a lot of other candidates who have their own visions for this country

151
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:08,260
Well not only is my slogan better than all of their slogans combined

152
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,400
But I have something they don't have

153
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,560
More YouTube subscribers !

154
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:18,440
Even though 60% of those subscribers aren't old enough to vote yet

155
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,160
And 40% can't vote because they are from a different country

156
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,100
That still leaves the rest of you

157
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:26,680
And together we can do it !

158
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:44,040
A new American leader from the future to defeat the washing machines in a fight for America again

159
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,760
I'm Ryan Higa and I don't approve any of this sh-

160
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,540

I need you help in order to win this campaign

166
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:58,240
I need all of you to keep hashtagging the hashtag

167
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,380
#Higa2016

168
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,460
And together we can defeat the washing machines

169
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,100
And make this country Washing Mac-free
