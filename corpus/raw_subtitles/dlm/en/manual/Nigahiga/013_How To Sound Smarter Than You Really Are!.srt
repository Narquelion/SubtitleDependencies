1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,680
Hey guys, so I...

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,520
Wait, why does it look so different in here?

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,640
huh

4
00:00:07,445 --> 00:00:10,585
Anyway um, hey guys so over the 10 to

5
00:00:10,585 --> 00:00:13,635
almost 11 years that I've been on YouTube, I've gotten to do a lot of things

6
00:00:13,635 --> 00:00:16,945
that I never thought I'd be able to do before and I'm sure if you ask any other youtubers that I've been around

7
00:00:16,945 --> 00:00:19,745
for that amount of time, they'll agree with me when I say that people start

8
00:00:19,745 --> 00:00:22,485
treating you like you're some kind of genius professional

9
00:00:22,485 --> 00:00:25,605
social media expert and I'm sure it is true for a lot of those youtubers

10
00:00:25,605 --> 00:00:27,760
who actually do consider themselves geniuses.

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,855
But for me even after 10 years of doing this, I still don't think

12
00:00:30,855 --> 00:00:34,165
I know exactly what I'm doing. I'm borderline dumb when it comes to this stuff. I just make the videos that I

13
00:00:34,165 --> 00:00:37,395
like making and luckily people watch them. I don't have some genius

14
00:00:37,395 --> 00:00:40,415
strategy or like expertise that I could share with everyone which is why I

15
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:43,105
bring this up. I get asked all the time to attend these like

16
00:00:43,105 --> 00:00:45,735
huge business conferences and meetings where people

17
00:00:45,735 --> 00:00:48,715
pretty much just ask for my expertise on social media

18
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:51,665
and they treat me like I'm one of the all-knowing of social media and to be honest

19
00:00:51,665 --> 00:00:53,660
when I go to these things, I feel completely out of place.

20
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:57,040
People that attend these things are like millionaire billionaire men and women

21
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,975
that own multiple businesses and they're all taking notes and

22
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,440
advice from this 26 year old college dropout with

23
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,400
stupid looking hair talk about YouTube and all the

24
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,140
expertise and knowledge that I have to share with them.

25
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,920
I mean I don't like to brag but I think I pretty much killed it.

26
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,000
So tell us Ryan, how does one get started on YouTube?

27
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,400
Um...well you see you have to make an account by clicking the sign up button

28
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,880
Okay are there any complications or problems that one might run into when starting a channel

29
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,480
and if so, how do you solve them?

30
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:31,400
Well I mean sometimes your username can already be taken so you solve that by adding like

31
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,940
a number to it or you could you know change a letter like you can make an e into like a 3

32
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,000
like backwards e.

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,900
Alright, one last question. How do you come up with your ideas?

34
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,500
Well, ideas are just thoughts

35
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,240
and everyone has thoughts. I mean I have thoughts right now, this meeting

36
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,720
could be a video idea. You know, like I could make literally this meeting a video.

37
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,940
Well, lets hope you don't do that because this is a very confidential meeting.

38
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,180
I mean it's already happening.

39
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:56,920
What?

40
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,040
Writing the video right now.

41
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,420
You really can't do that

42
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,820
It's too late. This is gonna be a video.

43
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,420
We can and we will sue you if you make a video about this event.

44
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,760
Okay, sure.

45
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,640
Oh yeah, that's why I have no stuff.

46
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,340
Ha, I'm just playing

47
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,760
But in all seriousness, having to hang out with these uh

48
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,200
Maybe we'll call them graduates

49
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,920
I started noticing some patterns between them.

50
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,440
Not just the successful ones but more so with the unsuccessful ones

51
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,100
that are appearing to be successful.

52
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,860
and today I'm gonna be teaching you just that.

53
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,680
How to sound smarter than you really are.

54
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,900
One of the easiest way to appear smarter than you really are is to dress the way they dress

55
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,760
but you see if you dress poorly, you'll look stupid.

56
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:39,180
For example, if you dress like a hobo or like a poor person, you'll never get any respect and

57
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,700
people will never think you're smart.

58
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,460
I mean take a look at this guy, you think people actually think this guy is smart and successful?

59
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,180
No

60
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,420
Or even if you wear like a plain shirt like this guy, you think anybody's gonna think you're smart and dress like that?

61
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:49,920
No!

62
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,920
If you want people to take you seriously, if you want people to think that you're smart

63
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,080
you have to dress smart.

64
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,300
Dress for success and only then will people believe that you're a genius.

65
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,140
Like this.

66
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,480
Pretty self-explanatory.

67
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,780
Normal people like you and I have a dictionary

68
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,900
they have a thesaurus

69
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,420
A lot of people just like to use words that people don't use as often.

70
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,340
For example, if someone is giving you the choice to pick between two options,

71
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,860
rather than just saying which option you want, you say "I'll take the latter".

72
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,040
So, which one would you like? A or B?

73
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,980
You know what, I'll take the latter.

74
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,060
Uhh but which one would you like?

75
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:18,700
The latter.

76
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,200
Oh, the latter. Oh ok, so you want the second one?

77
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,100
No, the ladders.

78
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:22,980
Oh, you want the first one?

79
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:23,760
Just the ladders?

80
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,860
So you want both of them or?

81
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,760
Oh my god, I'm just gonna get them myself then.

82
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,660
The letters!

83
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,280
Smart people always want to know what you do.

84
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,860
They always make their job sound way more important than it really is.

85
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,860
School janitor? More like certified educational hygienist.

86
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,140
Cashier? More like financial trades and delivery operator.

87
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:45,680
Stripper? More like prostitutional entertainer that does not engage in sexual activity for money.

88
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,380
See? Any job can sound important.

89
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:50,080
Even if you're not employed right now, it's 2017

90
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,080
everybody is working, they think.

91
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,800
What did you say you did again?

92
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:59,320
Oh, I am a freelance independent entrepreneurial leader in social media, marketing and research relations.

93
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:04,340
Meaning you're unemployed and you post and read comments on facebook?

94
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,620
and twitter too.

95
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,260
I see.

96
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,860
Well congratulations, you're hired!

97
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,260
Really?

98
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,860
Yeah, you can start as early as this evening.

99
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,820
Oh? this is a night job, what exactly was my job title again?

100
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:18,340
Oh well a prostituitional entertainer that does not engage in sexual activity for money.

101
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,360
Oh

102
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,740
Except minus the latter part of that.

103
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,840
The latter part? What does that

104
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,960
You'll probably have to engage.

105
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,460
Doesn't matter how smart you are if you hang out with people smarter than you

106
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,620
you're gonna be the dumb one.

107
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,000
So it's simple. Just hang out with people less intelligent than you.

108
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,140
If you think you're the dumbest person out of everyone you know

109
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,980
then well..you still have options.

110
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:37,980
Hey Marley.

111
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,820
You want bread? You want the bread? Go get it!

112
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,380
Hahaha idiot.

113
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:45,560
Wait, what?

114
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:46,720
Dumbass.

115
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,120
The real test to show that you're really smart...

116
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,300
Art.

117
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,660
Truly intelligent people can see art in everything

118
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,200
no matter how hard it is to see for the rest of you dummies.

119
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,900
Oh my god, it's so beautiful.

120
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,520
It's a masterpiece.

121
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,520
How is this part of the art exhibit?

122
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,000
Don't you see? This represents life.

123
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,060
Life itself. You start from nothing and you slowly make your way to the top.

124
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,860
For only a moment before falling all the way back down..

125
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:15,960
to nothing.

126
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,100
Excuse me.

127
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,500
What are you doing?

128
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,660
Wait, are you guys looking for the art exhibit? That's across the street.

129
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,540
I've come to find that this last one is 100% accurate.

130
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:31,460
All smart people must talk about politics.

131
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:35,260
And if you're anything like me, you probably know very little to nothing about politics.

132
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:38,600
So if you ever happen to get caught in a discussion with a smart person talking about politics

133
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,600
just agree with them.

134
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,460
That way they'll just keep talking and you won't have to.

135
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,420
-What's the deal with that? -Yeah it's pretty crazy

136
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,260
What do you think Ryan?

137
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,380
Um, I'm sorry what?

138
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,700
You know, about Trump and the wall between us and Mexico

139
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,540
What do you think about it?

140
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:53,600
Well, I mean like clearly we're...

141
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:57,640
it's talked about all over on the news and we're all

142
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,520
three of us are talking about it. 3 guys at a table during the day

143
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,480
so obviously yeah like 100% agree yup

144
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:09,140
but yeah, Trump is doing goo..a great job.

145
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,200
A great job?

146
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,260
At being horrible for the economy..just awful.

147
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:16,680
Well, I mean some people think he's actually helped the economy since he's became president

148
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,320
President? Right? He's been awfully great.

149
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,400
He's..he's a man that I just love

150
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,840
but come on? As a president, he's..

151
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,560
sucks!

152
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,420
killing it right now.

153
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:28,740
Yes ful..successful man that I just love love love!

154
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,380
He's killing all of our international ties.

155
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,600
..to make fun of because he's just so..

156
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,100
bad!

157
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:33,600
Right?

158
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,300
ass

159
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:34,800
Right?

160
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,480
He's a badass man.

161
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,240
That's why I completely support

162
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,920
that no country is gonna work with him

163
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,240
The other guy that he was running against

164
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,360
What?

165
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,400
I support the guy he was running against

166
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,600
Are you talking about Hillary Clinton?

167
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,520
Exactly! Right, Hillary Clinton.

168
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,760
Bill Clinton's mother..sis..

169
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,880
Bill's fam.

170
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,200
You know? But Obama tho

171
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,020
Right? Everybody loves him

172
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,760
He's got my vote locked in if you know what I mean

173
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,780
But you do know that he's not gonna be in the next election?

174
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,720
exactly what I was just about to say.

175
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,480
He can't run again.

176
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,720
He should not be running. He's getting old. He should be walking.

177
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,720
This is his final term. He can't have a third term.

178
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,360
Exactly why he needs to ace it. I mean

179
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,360
You know the finals are always worth more than the midterm.

180
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:18,240
Yeah, I can't really tell if you're joking or if you're just stupid.

181
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,180
The latter?

182
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,260
The latter!

183
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,500
Funny

184
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,140
Oh latter

185
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,660
Definitely gotta keep in touch. We'll see you later.

186
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,040
See you guys.

187
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,800
Oh my god, did I really just pull that off?

188
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,620
Oh my god, do you think he knew?

189
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,080
What the hell does a latter mean?

190
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,160
I don't know!

191
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:52,200
But again, with all jokes aside. It doesn't matter if you talk about politics a lot

192
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,880
or if you use big words like "the latter".

193
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,700
Everybody is different. Who's to say what's considered smart and what isn't?

194
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,280
Yeah maybe you did grow up being a straight A student your whole life

195
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,840
and you got a perfect SAT score

196
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,200
and maybe you did graduate from Harvard and got a PhD

197
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,040
and yes maybe you did start your own billion dollar company from scratch

198
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,900
Let me ask you this.

199
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,800
Do you know how to get your hair to this colour and how to maintain it?

200
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,280
Do you know how to cook and prepare a 3 course meal?

201
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,300
Do you know how to change a tyre or fix a leaking toilet?

202
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:22,360
or write, film and edit a video that's not too long and keeps the viewer's attention all the way to the end

203
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,720
without anyone clicking away because if you do...

204
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,480
I would love to learn.

205
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,260
Please teach me.
