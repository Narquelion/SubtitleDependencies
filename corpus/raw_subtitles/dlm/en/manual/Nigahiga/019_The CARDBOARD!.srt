1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,360
First there was the board

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,160
Then, there was the skateboard

3
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,440
Then, there was the skateboard with steering

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,700
And now for the first time ever

5
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:08,760
It's here!

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,340
The cardboard!

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,440
The cardboard also know as the Cybord, Airbord, Rolling Device

8
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,360
Is the future of transportation

9
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,220
Why walk when you could be not walking?

10
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:25,920
Step, after step, after step

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,900
Aren't you sick of it yet?

12
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,100
Don't you rather just be on wheels all the time?

13
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:30,220
Well, with the cardboard,

14
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,300
you will never not, not be on wheels again

15
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,140
So what will it cost?

16
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,140
Similar products will cost you an arm and a leg

17
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,300
But thanks to the cardboard's advanced design

18
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,720
It won't cost you any body parts at all,

19
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,640
Just cash

20
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,380
And did we mention that the cardboard is completely customisable?

21
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,580
Of course we haven't, we're only at that part now

22
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,500
Well, the cardboard is completely customisable

23
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,280
You'll never have the same cardboard as someone else

24
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,500
With are crazy selection of colours, such as,

25
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,080
And for the really daring, you can even get it in, red,

26
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:03,580
Yellow,

27
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:04,500
Or, blue

28
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:07,340
All mixed together to create a nice, prominent brown

29
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,160
But that's not all!

30
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,460
You'll also be able to customise the safety straps aswell

31
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,600
And not to mention the headlights and tail lights too

32
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,820
So, how does it work?

33
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:14,640
Now i know what you're thinking,

34
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,480
The cardboard literately defines gravity

35
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,640
So does it really work?

36
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,740
Well the answer is simple,

37
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,380
Definitely maybe it might...

38
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,640
You see, gravity is nothing more than a science word

39
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,920
And so is the word oxygen

40
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,860
Also know as O2, to most scientists

41
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,280
Meaning there's two o's,

42
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:27,860
Tools!

43
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,540
And tools are what makes things work

44
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,360
Meaning that the cardboard, indeed works

45
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,380
The only place that the cardboard wouldn't define gravity,

46
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:34,480
Is in space

47
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,640
Because there is no oxygen

48
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,140
So how could you get the cardboard?

49
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,700
Well, unfortunately it is not available yet

50
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,300
We've been having a really hard time funding our kick starter campaign

51
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,220
Because all of the homophobic commenter trolls,

52
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:45,000
that keeps saying the cardboard is fake and gay

53
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,180
But before you type that in this video let me ask you this,

54
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,740
Does this look fake to you?

55
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,580
Exactly, fake and gay?

56
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,760
More like real and gay!

57
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,180
So how can you help?

58
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,740
Now that you know all of the facts and information,

59
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:58,920
you know have a choice

60
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,420
Nae

61
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,260
A decision

62
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:00,760
Nae!

63
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,880
A responsibility

64
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,380
Nae Nae

65
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,120
To help us make this world a better place

66
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,200
By bringing the cardboard to a reality

67
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,020
All you have to do is go to our kick starter campaign and donate as much as you can

68
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,760
Whether it's just a little bit or a lot,

69
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,060
As long as it's alot,

70
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:13,560
We'll take it

71
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,960
Because without you, the cardboard is just silly nelly

72
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,380
It's only just a dream

73
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,580
So donate now and bring the cardboard to life

74
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,580
And before you know it, we could all be looking like this

00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:31,360
(Music by - Jack Elphick – Stadium Anthem Nr 08 – Alternative)

76
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,800
Oh yeah, it's a transformer as well too
