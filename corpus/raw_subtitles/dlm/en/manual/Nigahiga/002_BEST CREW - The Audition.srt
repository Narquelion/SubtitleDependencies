1
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,580
Alright. Who's first?

2
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:09,020
Me.

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,960
You can call me Sam.

4
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,480
Uncle Sam.

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,120
Okay, Uncle Sam. Let's see what you've got.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,940
Do the Uncle Sam

7
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,860
The Uncle Sam (X3)

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,940
Do the Uncle Jim

9
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,720
The Uncle Jim (X3)

10
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,820
Do the Uncle Sam and the Uncle Jim

11
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,900
The Uncle Sam and the Uncle Jim

12
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,922
Look at my feet, baby.

13
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,500
Look like I have four feet, like an animal.

14
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,100
Everybody to the dancing

15
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,140
Before you do romancing

16
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,938
What the hell was that?

17
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,540
I was dancing!

18
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,880
Pong, was that dancing?

19
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:47,840
It was kind of-

20
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,720
You shh, and you, get out.

21
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,580
Next.

22
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,360
Hey, guys.

23
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,360
I'm Duke. I'm here to dance for you guys.

24
00:01:01,362 --> 00:01:02,120
I hope you guys like it.

25
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,000
Don't worry, I saw this guy dance before.

26
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,220
He's really good.

27
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,720
Oh he'd better be good, Pong.

28
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,820
'Cause If he's not, I'm ripping up that drawing you made for me this morning.

29
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:15,780
(Electronic Dance Music starts to play)

30
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,340
(Gasps)

31
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,900
Hi, I'm Vanessa, and I'll be doing my routine.

32
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,880
5, 6, 7, 8.

33
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,020
Give me a B!

34
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:43,520
B!

35
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,620
Give me an E!

36
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:45,280
E!

37
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:45,780
Give me a-

38
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,140
Get the hell out of my office!

39
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,320
Next.

40
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,780
What- What are you doing here?

41
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,600
What do you mean? It's my first time!

42
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,260
We just saw you five minutes ago.

43
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,800
No, that was my twin brother, Uncle Sam!

44
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,780
He doesn't have the mustache like me!

45
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,940
You're clearly the same person you're wearing the same clothes.

46
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:11,180
What do you mean?! My brother's not as handsome as me!

47
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,000
What's that one?

48
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:17,740
Next.

49
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,420
I don't need that girl in my life

50
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:26,390
I don't need that girl by my side

51
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:27,380
I don't want-

52
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,760
This is a dance audition!

53
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,640
Oh, I'm s-

54
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,120
You're right, you're right! Okay.

55
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,800
(Clap hands) I don't need that girl in my life

56
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,240
I don't need that girl by my si-

57
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,500
Get out!

58
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,800
Ow!

59
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,380
(Breathes Deeply)

60
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,280
I'm here to do the dancing!

61
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,800
(Stomps Foot)

62
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,880
(Grabs box out of person and box on the ground)

63
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,740
(Screams punches and lands)

64
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,037
Hi, uh, we're here for the audition?

65
00:03:14,037 --> 00:03:15,037
Whatever.

66
00:03:17,975 --> 00:03:21,056
Five, four, three, two, one

67
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:25,280
(Heavy-Bass Techno Music starts to play)

68
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,520
Wow, that was- That was amazing!

69
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,420
Stunning!

70
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,880
That was incredible!

71
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,100
So beautiful!

72
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,340
You guys are exactly what we don't need.

73
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,640
We're on Youtube.

74
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,840
We wanted a third member, not a fourth.

75
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,451
Nothing good comes in fours.

76
00:03:55,451 --> 00:03:57,453
You know what comes in fours? Squares.

77
00:03:57,453 --> 00:03:58,894
We'll take one of you.

78
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,340
One of us?

79
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,620
Na, we don't need them.

80
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,880
Y'all are whacked.

81
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,600
Look at those stupid bumblebee outfits.

82
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,800
I don't even know what that is.

83
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,100
You call yourself a crew?

84
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,440
You'll never be a crew.

85
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,280
You shut your dirty mouth!

86
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,240
(Both make mocking noises)

87
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,960
Rave, don't listen to them.

88
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,760
As long as we believe in each other, right?

89
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,020
I don't believe in you.

90
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:24,120
But I believe in you twice as much.

91
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,200
(Hands right next to him and hands backs up)

92
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,540
Who are you?

93
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,140
Are you here for the audition?

94
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:45,280
(Awe-Inspiring Music starts to play)

95
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,160
You're in!

96
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,220
Mm, thanks Rave.

97
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,080
This is the best day ever.

98
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,740
Hey, you guys like ice cream too?

99
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,120
Teehee!

100
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,900
Uncle Jim! No, he's...

101
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:10,640
I'll find out.

102
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,040
(Laughter)

103
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,600
(Laughs)

104
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,820
(Mutters)

105
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,480
This is the best day ever.

106
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,160
It's fine, right?

107
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,380
Yes, Kevin. It's fine.

108
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,780
This doesn't go on the Internet, or anything, right?
