1
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:08,240
I'm sitting on my bed

2
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,660
I'm contemplating life

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,160
All the struggles in my head...

4
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:19,680
I've been waiting for so long

5
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,360
Had time to write this song

6
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,080
What did I do wrong?

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,260
(Did I do wrong?)

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,540
I'm like a ghost in your chatroom

9
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:29,520
(Ghost in your chatroom!)

10
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,760
No-ones talking when I do

11
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:31,680
(Talkin' when I do!)

12
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,720
I'm always send in the best troops

13
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,640
(Send in the best troops!)

14
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,440
I got our clan name tattoo!

15
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,160
So why!

16
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,480
Does no-one like me!

17
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:46,920
You never invite me to war!

18
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,160
(To war...)

19
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,860
And I!

20
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:53,360
Wish you would send me!

21
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,080
My castle's empty!

22
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,020
I'm feeling so ignored!

23
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:09,880
Whoa! Woha! Woha! Whoooooooooa!

24
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,800
And I...And I just go to you?

25
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,580
Never missing your requests

26
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,740
That ever came from you.

27
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,880
(Came from you...)

28
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,260
Raid!

29
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,700
I'm raiding everyday!

30
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,960
As my archers die away.

31
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,320
I hunt elixir for your base to improve!

32
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,200
Another war is declared!

33
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,320
(A war is declared!)

34
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,840
But I'm not there!

35
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,960
(An' I'm not there!)

36
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,600
I quit my job for this crew...

37
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,720
(Got no mo' money!)

38
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,240
I got more clan name tattoos!

39
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,680
So why...does no one like me?

40
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,800
You never invite me...to war

41
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,900
(To war...)

42
00:01:52,900 --> 00:02:01,060
And I...wish you'd send me, my castle's empty!

43
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:04,200
I'm feelin' so ignored!

44
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:14,800
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoooooooooa!

45
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,420
My shields...are coming to an end...

46
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,400
My walls are broken in, I can't defend

47
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,520
from your negligence...

48
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,740
and right...right before my eyes...

49
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:35,740
I got notified to my surprise for the first time in my life!

50
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:40,500
I see troops! My castle is full!

51
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,940
I was wrong!

52
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:46,580
They cared all along!

53
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,500
But then I checked,

54
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,120
now I know I have no friends..

55
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,380
Cuz a real friend wouldn't send

56
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,400
Level 1 Goblins!!

57
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,460
So why?!

58
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,200
Does no one like me!?

59
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,280
You never invite me to war!

60
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,640
(To war!)

61
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,980
And I...wish you would SEND ME!

62
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,340
My castle's empty!

63
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:19,800
I'M FEELIN' SO IGNORED!!

64
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:27,880
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoooooa!

65
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,880
Feelin' so ignored!!

66
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:38,020
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whooooooa!

67
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:42,020
Feelin' so ignored!!

68
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,700
See, that's why no one plays Clash of Clans with you.

69
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,660
Oh...

70
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:55,940
So..

71
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,060
Game of War then?

72
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,420
YEAH!!!!

73
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,040
Oh... wait, our phones are broken!

74
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:13,380
So why...does no one like me? You never invite me to war...
