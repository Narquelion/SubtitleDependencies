00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,760
Every year of every day, thousands of people fall victim to FWP.

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:06,080
I'm so cold.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,320
I'm starving.

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,840
Nobody cares about me.

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,160
Also known as First World Problems.

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,380
I'm so cold.

7
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,880
Somebody set the A/C to 72.

8
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,840
I need it at 73.

9
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,780
Starving, all we have is leftovers.

10
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:24,840
Nobody cares about me. Nobody commented or liked my status.

11
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,600
Hi, I'm Ryan Higa.

12
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,540
And for just five hours of attention a day,

13
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:30,520
you can help somebody with FWP.

14
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,120
Everyone keeps putting so much pressure on me.

15
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,520
I don't know what I want for my birthday.

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,240
I have too much chips for my dip.

17
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,540
But if I open a new dip, I'll have too much dip for my chips.

18
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,260
Why does Apple keep making new iPhones?

19
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,320
Now I have to get another one.

20
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,080
They've been through so much struggle.

21
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,160
The remotes over there, but I'm all the way over here.

22
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,440
So much hardship.

23
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,940
My iPhone 5 is too big for my skinny jeans.

24
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,040
So much attention.

25
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,980
(Attention X3)

26
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,700
I poured my cereal without checking to see if we had milk.

27
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,820
We didn't.

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,740
So please. Show your support, and send them this video.

29
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,680
And show them how much we care about their FWPs.

30
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,440
I bought so many groceries.

31
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,800
Now I'll have to make two trips.

32
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:19,060
All you have to do is call the URL, 1-800-DOT-ORG.

33
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,800
And we'll send you the FWP Helping Kit.

34
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,620
Which includes a bridge, a straw, and a full cup with the cover.

35
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,440
Here's a bridge. Now get over it.

36
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:31,080
Here's a straw. Now suck it up.

37
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,820
Here's the full cup. Now shut the full cup.

38
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:35,320
(Closes the lid)

39
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,380
With your help. we can put an end of F.W.P.s.

40
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,140
And focus on the real problems,

41
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,080
like starving children, or homeless people.

42
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,160
Because if you're complaining about something as silly as the iPhone 5,

43
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,740
just wait until you see the iPhone 6.

44
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,720
Oh this? This is the iPhone 5s.

45
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,720
This is the iPhone 6.

46
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,600
(Screams & Bams)

47
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,680
Teehee!
