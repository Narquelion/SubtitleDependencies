1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,140
Every year of every day, each month of the week,

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,400
thousands, millions, even hundreds of people

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,160
continue to fall victim to FWPs.

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,500
I'm so sick.

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,860
I have no place to sleep tonight.

6
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:14,680
So hungry, and there's nothing to eat.

7
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,780
Also known as, first world problems.

8
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,860
I'm so sick of these routine doctors check ups.

9
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,600
There's never anything wrong with me.

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,280
I have no place to sleep tonight.

11
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,040
My friends took the bed and the couch.

12
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,200
So hungry, and there's nothing to eat.

13
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,540
I mean on this little carb diet sure

14
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:33,560
I can have all the steak I want, but a steak without the potatoes.

15
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:36,820
Hi, I'm Ryan Higa.

16
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,780
You may remember me from the first FWP campaign.

17
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,800
When not only are FWP's still around,

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,860
but they're getting much, much worse.

19
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:46,740
My phone always dies at my friends house,

20
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,980
and all he had is the old iPhone charger.

21
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,960
Too much clothes. Drawers won't close.

22
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,460
It's like having a mountain in my way,

23
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,720
and every time I get over it, there's always another.

24
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,640
Why did God even have to make speed bumps?

25
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,000
Ignoring the problem does not make you go away.

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,180
My hands are so big.

27
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:03,860
I can never reach the bottom half of the Pringles can.

28
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,100
These people are continuing to suffer every single day.

29
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,200
I just bought this dress yesterday, and now it's on sale?

30
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,400
These FWP's, first world problems,

31
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,680
whatever you want to call them, aren't going anywhere

32
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,320
unless you do something about them.

33
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,280
My boyfriend didn't text me back,

34
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,580
but he just tweeted.

35
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,600
It's like everything I built came crashing down all at once.

36
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,840
The poop already began. Phone not in hand.

37
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,060
I'm so hungry. I already brushed my teeth.

38
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,720
The pool was too cold. The Jacuzzi's too hot.

39
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,540
I ordered the salad. Now I'll never taste the soup.

40
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,560
My owner got me bacon treats,

41
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,740
but they're not even barbecue flavored.

42
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,600
But now there's a way you can help,

43
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,460
by calling the number 1-800-www.FWP@gmail.org/

44
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:56,400
:) / :( /dancing lady in red dress//

45
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,360
We'll send you the FWP helper kit, which includes an open book.

46
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,920
Here's an open book. Now shut it.

47
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,500
(Shuts the book)

48
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,840
A miniature batch of wine.

49
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,300
Here's a mini batch of wine.

50
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,940
Now you can stop being such a little winey batch.

51
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,580
And a complete poker set,

52
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,020
including a case, chips, cards,

53
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,120
and not to mention, poker sunglasses.

54
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:19,460
I don't mean to be heartless, but welcome to the club.

55
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,800
In case you didn't notice, there's no one here who gives a chip

56
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,800
so if you could just cut it out,

57
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,720
grow a four king pair, and deal with it, that would be just amazing.

58
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,940
With your help, we can put an end to FWP's for good,

59
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,000
and focus on the real problems, like

60
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,700
violence, or drugs, or people who still

61
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,040
don't know which you're to use.

62
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,940
The Biebs, Crocs, yellow starburst.

63
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,220
The real issues at hand.

64
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:47,380
So please, join me. Help a soul, and help us all.

65
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,480
The heck is that...

66
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,520
Oh...

67
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,560
My internet's so slow it always has to buffer first.

68
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,460
Teehee!

69
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,100
So thank you guys so much for watching.

70
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,160
If you want to see bloopers and behind the scenes, click on the left.

71
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,580
If you want to see the previous FWP video, click on the one on the right.

72
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,280
And if you don't want to click any of them at all,

73
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,220
then that's kind of a problem,

74
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:15,260
and that'll be sad for me.
