00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:01,340
*Sniff*

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:02,660
Hey Guys

3
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:03,300
So you probably already heard

4
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,040
all the hype around Pokemon GO Right now.

5
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,860
Unless you've been living under a GEOdude

6
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:07,500
*Motor Laugh*

7
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,300
It's literally everywhere

8
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,920
Youtube, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram

9
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,980
and that's just online

10
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,980
turn off the cumputer they are talking about it on TV

11
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:15,840
you go outside to a park or grocery store or anything public

12
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,080
there is probably people playing it there too

13
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,580
I mean there's been so much hype on POKEMON GO

14
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,800
that I've been that I started to see it in places that is not

15
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,220
*don't do drugs kids*

16
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,240
*and also don't play pokemon go in the hood*

17
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,040
*is that an ONIX*

18
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,140
*naaaaaah it's just poop*

19
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:34,640
* F/CK OFF MARLEY *

20
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,400
* HELLO MF *

21
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:41,900
* Greg's parents are the proudest ever*

22
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,100
* how meek mill catch Nicki Minaj *

23
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,440
* my anaconda don't*

24
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,280
*don't what*

25
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:49,420
* I don't know :(*

26
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:50,040
*yaaay congraaats OMG*

27
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,200
What ?!

28
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,900
Don't act like you wouldn't catch her too

29
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:53,680
I mean she's still rare

30
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,240
it's better than catching Taylor swift again (LOL)

31
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:55,760
and STDs xD

32
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,420
that's all there's around here

33
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,100
and NO before you swifties jump to conclusions

34
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,740
I'm not saying that taylor swift is a rattata (nice pic ryan lol)

35
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:01,760
because she looks like a rat

36
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,360
Rattata rattata RATTATA (WTF)

37
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:04,520
it's a vine meme (ah ok thanks ryan)

38
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,120
RATTATAAAA

39
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,680
she's a rattata because rattatas are everywhere (like swifties)

40
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,860
and even if you don't wanna see or hear another one

41
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:09,800
you're still going to

42
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,100
and also because rattata can learn the ability to swift

43
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,280
and just like taylor swift they might not be the best attack (Kim was the goalkeeper)

44
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,340
it's still gonna be a hit

45
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,780
because swift doesn't miss

46
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,220
ok enough pokemon Jorgging (is that a word)

47
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:19,720
jorgging ?!!?!?!?!

48
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,140
I don't know why I used that word ( me neither)

49
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,400
I've never used that word before

50
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,680
it's sounds like a pokemon (idk)

51
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,440
jorgging JORGGING jorgging jorgging JOOOORGGIIIIING

52
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,260
see this is exactly what I was talking about

53
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,920
it's the 90's again (yaaay !!!)

54
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,300
it is all about pokemon

55
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,560
it's taking over the world AGAIN

56
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,040
and this time its not something you should've been ashamed off

57
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,040
when I played pokemon and collected pokemon cards as a kid I've got to it like almost in secret

58
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:42,960
because back then play pokemon make you a nerd make you uncool

59
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,560
and now the table have turned and the chairs well

60
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,400
we now live in a teenage where pokemon does not make you ...

61
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,400
well I mean we are all still nerds

62
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,480
but there's more of us now

63
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,940
Pokemon go has once again make pokemon the biggest thing in the world right now *except for my :) *

64
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,040
and no one should be happier about it than me

65
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,500
I've always been a super-Pokemon fan

66
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,100
I mean I've played all the games from the beginning

67
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,320
Pokemon RED BLUE GREEN YELLOW (why not black)

68
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,800
pokemon snap pokemon pinball

69
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,700
I've watched every episode of pokemon that was on TV

70
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,680
I've even had the pokemon sound track so I can memorize all the songs

71
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,200
* I'm not writing that *

72
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,920
Part of my life I'm particularly proud of

73
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:19,320
but you need to know how big a pokemon fan I'm in order to truely understand me when I say this

74
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:24,820
I'm not trying to be a hater or a downer or anything but I can't be the only one who absolustely loves pokemon

75
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,120
that dosn't love pokemon go *me too Ryan*

76
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,280
*STFU loosers*

77
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,040
sean : you're just jealous

78
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,980
diana : you just suck that's why !

79
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:29,960
paco yellow : oh no sh*t

80
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,920
*ok screw it I'm not writing all those beeps *

81
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,200
*is someone dying*

82
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:34,920
*call a doctor*

83
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,800
*Oh Hi Ryan !*

84
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,360
Oh I forgot to put the black bars

85
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,820
and now the text

86
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,660
*nice ryan*

87
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,360
*magic of editing *

88
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,200
Pretty accurate

89
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,400
Look I don't hate the game

90
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,640
but in my honest opinion I was a little disapointed

91
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,500
specially after all the commercials they put out

92
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:54,100
that .. to get every body excited about it and trust me I had normal expectations I wasn't expecting the game to look like the commercial

93
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,960
it's an unrealistic expectation

94
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,420
well maybe not I mean there's virtual reality now

95
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,460
but to go from this to this

96
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,540
it's a little missleading

97
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,120
i still think it's a great idea

98
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,420
and I know the game took like 10 or 20 years (WTF) to get done

99
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,940
but I still think it wasn't ready to be released

100
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:09,100
.... it's not really pokemon yet

101
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,660
it's a google maps styled with pokemon

102
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:14,900
it's pokemon least like pokemon game WHAT I'M I saying?!

103
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,420
that did not make sense

104
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,520
how do I describe that better in 2016

105
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:18,840
*wtf you looking at ryan*

106
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,620
Oh

107
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,400
*magic snaps*

108
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,820
pokemon go is basically google maps mixed with four square with a pokemon snapchat filter on it

109
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:26,600
fam

110
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,380
*are you okey ryan ?*

111
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,600
with no chill

112
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,380
lit

113
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:29,980
savage

114
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,840
*I have no idea what he just said*

115
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,720
*stop watching too much ricegum*

116
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:35,600
DDDAAAAAAABBB

117
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,240
*and KSI*

118
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,460
I'm still hyped

119
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:40,560
but you know what its not even the look of pokemon go that bothers me

120
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,640
I can get pass that

121
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,420
It's the fact that half the time you cant sign into the game

122
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:44,920
because the servers are down

123
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,980
or they're experiencing difficulties

124
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,580
and maybe it's just me but even when you can sign in

125
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,040
when you are playing the game it just freezes randomly *get an samsung galaxy note 7 man* *and for me too pls*

126
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,880
specially for some reason when you finally catch something (other than STDs)

127
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,140
something that you spent a lot of time looking for (you could be making more videos at that time )

128
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,560
and it kills batterie faster than any game I ever played before

129
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,060
I can go on for a long time *pls stop*

130
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,240
but I didn't made this video to hate on pokemon go

131
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:07,220
in fact I actually hope the game becomes more successful so that they can put some money into it and then I can finally play it

132
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,080
and who knows (1.0)

133
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,260
the game is so popular and they're making so much money that they probably are working on a second version that looks like the commercial

134
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:17,400
so for all of you that haven't given a shot yet specially if you're someone who loves pokemon like me *or me*

135
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,280
Don't have high expectations and it's still a fun game *and don't get high too *

136
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,380
I mean when you can actually play it *good luck*

137
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,940
just don't expect it to look like the commercials

138
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:26,740
Don't expect it to be what we all wish for as kids POKEMON in the real world

139
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,580
cuz it's not quiet there yet

140
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:33,880
in the downtime that I was actually waiting for the pokemon go servers to come back I wiped something together to help you with that

141
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,600
Here's a more honest commercial for what Pokemon go is really like

142
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,780
in the form of the same show that we all grow up with and loved watching except for the kids who did not know that show existed

143
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,480
fam lit savage no chill *never say never to drugs*

144
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,260
DAAAB

145
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,800
OMG I'm not gonna put that in YES I'M

146
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,140

*how about you?*

152

161
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,440
with only seconds to react Ryan finally throw his pokeball and ...

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:01,980
