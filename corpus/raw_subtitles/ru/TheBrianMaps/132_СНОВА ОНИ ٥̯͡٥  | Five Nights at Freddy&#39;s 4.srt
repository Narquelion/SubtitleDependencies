И он с нами разговаривает О ГОСПОДИ!

14
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,900
Он говорит

00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,360
Так тут у нас мини-игра,и она мне уже не нравиться

16
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,700
Потому-что меня пугает этот медведь который следит за мной глазами

17
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,100
Я хочу выйти,Давай!Стучись в эту чёртову дверь

00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:51,940
и начинается

21
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,560
Ночь 1 да

00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,380
And also we have a cupboard certainly not out of any vylazit muzzle

27
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,420
but you would not be scared if you are bi night went to the closet and saw something like

28
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:12,720

29
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:13,920
So there was no one

30
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,160

31
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:17,960
