1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,040
Hey!

2
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:10,960
Hey, what's going on?

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,500
I don't know, Franke

4
00:00:12,005 --> 00:00:13,500
 

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,240
I just haven't been feeling inspired lately...

6
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,600
You go in there

7
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,160
And you sing from the heart!

8
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,860
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

9
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,860
8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1,

10
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:45,140
9, 10, 11, 12

11
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,180
9, 10, 11, 12

12
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:46,980
13, 14

13
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,780
15, 16, 17

14
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,820
15, 16, 17

15
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,660
18, 19, 20

16
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,640
21, 22

17
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,240
23, 24, 25

18
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,380
26, 27, 28, 29

19
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,800
30!!!

20
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,220
Fuck all the haters, that said I couldn't do it

21
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:09,680
I said I'd count to 30 and you know I'd fuckin' do it

22
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,800
I'm that boy

23
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,700
That's my boy

24
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,620
And I love to count

25
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,620
I'm that boy

26
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,640
That's my boy

27
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,480
That's my boy

28
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,260
That's my boy

29
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,180
That's my boy!

30
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,380
I'm that boy!

31
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,240
That's my fuckin' boy!

32
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,060
That's my boy!

33
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,020
That's my boy!

34
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:33,300
I'm that boy!!!

35
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,040
I fuck with you if you say you love to count

36
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,560
Counting is my favorite and that's what this song's about

37
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,100
Sing it loud

38
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,220
And sing it proud

39
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:48,380
'Cause no this ain't the alphabet, just in case you had a doubt

40
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:48,920
It's like

41
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,840
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,

42
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,680
9, 10, 11, 12,

43
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,640
13, 14,

44
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,480
15, 16, 17,

45
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,400
18, 19, 20,

46
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,260
21, 22,

47
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,040
23, 24, 25,

48
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:08,220
26, 27, 28, 29,

49
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,280
30

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,300
I saw your face

51
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,720
When I counted up to 10, you knew it wasn't 30

52
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,740
My mom's ashamed

53
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,660
I know if I don't finish, you'll probably disown me

54
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:31,220
Is it Einstein? Is it Newton? Galileo? Maybe Uller?

55
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,220
That's giving me this power

56
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,220
To finish what I started!

57
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,160
'Cause I never though that numbers were better!

58
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,040
I could never wrap my head around that letter!

59
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,100
I know I have to follow my (heart)!

60
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:47,040
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,

61
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,960
9, 10, 11, 12,

62
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,840
13, 14,

63
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,820
15, 16, 17,

64
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,620
18, 19, 20,

65
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,360
21, 22,

66
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,160
23, 24, 25,

67
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,420
26, 27, 28, 29,

68
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,720
30!!!

69
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,940
I fuck with you if you say you love to count

70
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,760
Counting is my favorite and that's what this song's about
