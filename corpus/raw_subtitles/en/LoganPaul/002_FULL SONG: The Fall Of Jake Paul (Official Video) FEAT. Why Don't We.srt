12
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,900

15
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,900

Don't forget boy, You were my shadow on vine.

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Now you got a few subscribers,

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And you think that you're the s***

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'll admit, you got money, you got bars, you got chicks

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
But you're a d***

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You ain't thankful for your fans, It's kinda funny

25
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,500
do your investors know team 10 ain't making any money?

26
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,500
See, it starts with the talent,

27
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,500
But it's hard when you got none

28
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,500

YOU DON'T F*CK WITH THE LOGANG!

34

Hold up, I'ma throw up, looking at your face,

35
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,700
You don't know what it means to glow up.

00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,180
Tryin' to dance and acting class,

37
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,680
It's doing nothing, now you try to rap

38
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,500
Come on, hold up.

00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,920
Catch the flow, you can't oh no,

40
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,820
Maybe Team 10's got it?

41
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,040
I mean, that's how you grow.

42
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,500
But you still can't sell out any shows.

43
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,200
No, you still can't find some matching clothes!

44
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,080
(YAH YEET!)

45
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:26,580

46
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:27,500

00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,000

00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:39,580
You just ruined your life, yeah!

57
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,060
What happened Jake, man, we used to love each other...

58
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,680
After all, we came from the same mother.

59
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:50,160
Biologically you know that makes us brothers!

60
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,740
So much negativity it really makes me wonder.

61
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,240
(Why?)

62
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,000

00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,760
When you insult me Jakey, it really hurts.

65
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,880
Sometimes I wish my real brother was Dirk.

66
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,940

(That's f*cked up, Jake...)

88
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,220
When the contract dies,

00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,660
So does their career, it ends!

90
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,720
(That's... also a fact.)

91
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,280
Are you mad just cause you couldn't sign the Dolans?

92
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,020
(They're smarter than you...)

93
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,960
So you had to replace them with SOME SPANISH TWINS?!
