00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,785
Bella: Okay, if you ever see me running, it's either free cake, pizza or zombies are real.

2
00:00:02,785 --> 00:00:05,425
Christie: *gasp* But you think that zombies like pizza?

3
00:00:05,425 --> 00:00:08,845
Bella: Duh Christie, even vegans like pizza.

4
00:00:17,615 --> 00:00:19,155
Pull up on you

5
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,260
Standing with your girls looking good

6
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:23,820
I just gotta have you

7
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,440
Started conversatin' then you asked me all about my shampoo

8
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,960
Thinkin' "What's that about?"

9
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,080
0:33.0 But it kinda made me laugh so I told ya come through

10
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,920
You know what we gon' do

11
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,560
Candles are lit, lights are down, playing Cody Simpson

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,440
Running your fingers through all of this blonde ambition

13
00:00:42,605 --> 00:00:45,955
 

14
00:00:45,955 --> 00:00:46,955
 

15
00:00:47,425 --> 00:00:50,405
Till I found you in the shower but the water ain't runnin' and you still got all your clothes on

16
00:00:50,565 --> 00:00:51,875
Got my products on the counter and I put it all together

17
00:00:52,205 --> 00:00:55,295
I just can't get you outta my hair

18
00:00:55,295 --> 00:00:56,375
 

19
00:00:59,475 --> 00:01:00,625
Can't get you outta my hair

20
00:01:04,705 --> 00:01:05,705
And I know it ain't fair

21
00:01:06,235 --> 00:01:09,295
Tryna blow dry and brush it, you just wanna touch it

22
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:10,335
I just can't get you outta my hair

23
00:01:10,965 --> 00:01:14,465
I just can't get you outta my hair

24
00:01:21,475 --> 00:01:22,475
I just can't get you outta my hair

25
00:01:32,715 --> 00:01:34,095
I just can't get you outta my hair

26
00:01:35,035 --> 00:01:38,365
Woke up feeling funny but the do is money so it's okay

27
00:01:39,705 --> 00:01:41,745
Walking down the stairs saw your purse sittin' in the hallway

28
00:01:42,115 --> 00:01:43,115
Thinkin' "What's that about?"

29
00:01:43,245 --> 00:01:46,515
Came around the corner with a can of hairspray

30
00:01:46,515 --> 00:01:47,655
 

31
00:01:48,135 --> 00:01:50,995
Let me hit the replay

32
00:01:51,745 --> 00:01:52,745
Candles are out, lights are up, I'm still on a mission

33
00:01:53,355 --> 00:01:54,815
 

34
00:01:55,185 --> 00:01:56,885
She said "I just wanna give you a deep condition"

35
00:01:57,925 --> 00:02:01,095
 

36
00:02:01,965 --> 00:02:04,995
Cause I'm lookin' so good and I'm feelin' even betta and I'm smellin' like a rainstorm

37
00:02:04,995 --> 00:02:05,995
 

38
00:02:06,755 --> 00:02:09,875
She said I got body but she ain't talkin' body

39
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:10,975
I just can't get you outta my hair

40
00:02:14,065 --> 00:02:15,165
Can't get you outta my hair

41
00:02:17,475 --> 00:02:18,475
 

42
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,305
And I know it ain't fair

43
00:02:20,795 --> 00:02:23,855
Tryna blow dry and brush it, you just wanna touch it

44
00:02:23,885 --> 00:02:24,885
just can't get you outta my hair

45
00:02:25,515 --> 00:02:28,925
I just can't get you outta my

46
00:02:36,005 --> 00:02:37,005
I just can't get you outta my

47
00:02:45,345 --> 00:02:46,345
I just can't get you outta my

48
00:02:58,665 --> 00:02:59,665
Outta my

49
00:03:07,555 --> 00:03:10,335
Logan: Tryna blow dry and brush it, you just wanna touch it, I can't get you outta my- *gets slapped* Oh my gosh...

50
00:03:10,335 --> 00:03:12,305
 

51
00:03:12,895 --> 00:03:15,885
Bella: *pushes him* You're...weird! Stay away from me.

52
00:03:15,885 --> 00:03:18,005
Christie: We're gonna get pizza.

53
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:19,725
Logan: I'm Logan...pizza...pizza, okay bye. *walks off awkwardly* (Poor Logie

54
00:03:20,275 --> 00:03:22,295
 

55

I just can't get you outta my, outta my
