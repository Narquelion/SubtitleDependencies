00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,460
Jake hasn't changed at all dude... he still thinks he's a thug and he's a still a whiny ass bitch

2
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:08,860
AYO~ Good Morning Logang! WHASPOPPIN'!

Yo~, we just set up a wall of merch for a photoshoot that we're doing

Getting right into the day, I'm heading to set later BUT, look at this bro~ this is DOPE.

00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:20,400
We got everything guys... If you don't know, we are having a pop up shop in New York this weekend

Alright, we're back at the crib, my roommate, young Evan, yo, first off, no one leaves my shoulder without telling them.

11
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,940
You bro~ HOW?!... Yo. OK, just one sec.

12
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,600

00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,280
Just give me one sec, Maverick. Thanks~ OK, HOW?!~

14
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:55,240
Can I tell you something?

15
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:56,920
I am Jesus.

16
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,060
But.. But.. They were a lot shorter back then, so that's why people like...

17
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,900
I was still vlogging this whole thing.

18
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:04,920
Awww~ S£$%.

19
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:11,100
Hey, Jesus bro~, I shouldn't of vlogged that, I'm sorry... Bro, come on, I have something to show you, just trust me.

20
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:11,940
Come on.

21
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,700
*Heheheh* Are you good bro~? Why you taking Jesus's bed dude?

22
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,680
SOOOO CUTEE~

23
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,500
Are you mad bro?~

24
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,820
Evan: GET THE F#£$ OUT OF MY BED. Logan: OH S"£$, JESUS IS ANGRY

25
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:25,420
He didn't mean it Kong, he was just kidding, he's just short... tempered.

26
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,800
Yo.. no. stahp, stahp, ow, ow, ow.. F#$% me (?). Ow, OW OWWWW

27
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,040
POWER OF CHRIST COMPELS YOU!

28
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:33,340
ALRIGHT WE'RE GOING TO SET, WE'RE GOING TO SET.

29
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,200
Y'ELLO, OK guys, I'm in my trailer... I just realised something OK, like *BRRAGUHSUGHUH*

30
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,940
I've been on set for like 4 hours, and vlogging on set is hard BRO~!

31
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,240
I GOT NO CONTENT!~

32
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:48,280
Luckily, this is my last day, then back to the epic savagery that is, Logan Paul Vlogs.

33
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,040
But right now, I'm looking around and.. oh there it is, yup.

34
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,580
Yaaaa~ this is happening, right now.

35
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,160
Good ol' Tabasco sauce, going down the hatch.

36
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,420
Wait, hold on, I got distracted, this is not yours?

37
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,560
No, no, It's yours.

38
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,680
They just left a box of... potatoes?

39
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,040
They dropped my burrito, and they only gave me hashbrowns...

40
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,660
I'm going to eat it, 'cause I'm fat.

41
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:08,900
You want some Tabasco with that?

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,500
*UUHGUGHGUH*

43
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,500
(nice...)

44
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,520
*BAUHAUABAUABAUHAUBAUH*

45
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,080
That made me sick... I need more potato... *AHUAAMAUUM*

46
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,920
D'you need this? A FWIRER EXSTWINGWISHER

47
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:23,760
I'm OK, honestly, I missed my mouth... I just wanted to spray.

48
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,760
Well, that's a good start to the vlog... what do you say?

49
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,900
Alright guys, given the beef that's going on between me and my brother right now...

50
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:34,540
I figured it'd be interesting to go back and watch the videos that we made when we were kids.

51
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:37,280
Bro~, we've been making YouTube videos since I was 10.

52
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,960
Yeah~, no.. OK, story.

53
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:44,940
Those ones... like the super young ones, I actually deleted when I was like, 15.

54
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,000
NOOOOO~

55
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,640
Yeah, like the really young, pre-puberty. I know bro... here's why.

56
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,960
I wasn't a full Maverick back then, I was like 16 years old, and I had a crush on this girl.

57
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,880
And her younger sister watched our videos.. because Jake and I were like the kids in town that made videos.

58
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,500
and everyone pretty much knew us... oh hello~~

59
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,300
Hey guys~ what'dya doing in here?

60
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,880
Just vlogging, step in the frame

61
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,480
just vlogging... ma nhams Jheff.

62
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:09,100
Anyways, I had a crush on this girl, and she saw these videos that I made when I was really young

63
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,820
and she was embarrassed by me, so I got embarrassed, and then I deleted all of them.

64
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:17,580
I'm an idiot! If you ever post videos on the internet, keep them there, no matter who makes fun of you, just keep them there.

65
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:21,780
Anyways, there still are videos online of us when we were younger, so we're going to watch them

66
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:26,880
I just want to say, like, you will see the difference, of like, what we were like back then and what we're like now...

67
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,400
I actually love Zoosh(?)

68
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,680
Zoosh, is what we called, by the way, could you just step in frame, or just hide in the corner

69
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,340
Yeah, thanks bro. <3

70
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,380
So we called ourselves 'Zoosh', because, Smosh inspired us when we.. we were..

71
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,440
*NNHGNHGGGEEEEE~*

72
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,580
When we were younger, which makes me, it makes me curious as to who am inspiring right now,

73
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,480
that will become the next me, in like, 10 years.

74
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,120
Zircon!

75
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,760
MUUUHBOIII ZIRCON!

76
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,880
OK, without further-a-do, let's watch some kid videos bro~

77
00:03:54,880 --> 00:04:00,560
Younger LP: 'Alright everyone, with profits decreasing and sales tax sky rocketing... we're facing a standstill..'

78
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,760
WHAT THE F#£$ WAS I DOING?!~

79
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,200
Question is, who wrote the script?

80
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,920
I DON'T KNOW! I think I wrote it, I thought it was funny...

81
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,440
Younger LP: 'Sure, blame the economy, blame the president, but let me tell you something...'

82
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:15,060
'BLAME THE PRESIDENT', Donald Trump, what'cha doing? Profits decreasing, sales taxes sky rocketing!

83
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,620
Wait... who was the president when you made this?

84
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:19,760
Don't know...

85
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:22,600
(at least he didn't smash plates..)

86
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:28,660
Younger LP: 'My lil' Timmy's lost 8 pounds, a'ight? We better step it up, or I'm laying down the hammer.'

87
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:34,280
YEEEEEEEA~ Till this day, I lay down the hammer.. we laid down the hammer on Jake bro~

88
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,380
Call us the Ogang, because he took the L, YAAAAAAAA~

89
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,800
You get it? Yeah I get it, he took the L... 'cause he took the L from the Logang...

90
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,060
They need you in there to actually shoot something... NAAAOOOOOOOOOOOOO~

91
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:49,480
The life of a vlogger/actor... a'ight guys, I'll be right back, quick cut.

92
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,720
HEY GUYS, You recognise this place? WE'RE BACK HOME. YAAAAAA~

93
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,280
It's not my home.. It's MY home, YAAAAA~

94
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,060
Logan: Alright so... what? Jeff: Can I go home?

95
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:02,960
Alright you guys, he wants to go home because it is 1:39AM, look at that... YAAAAAAA~

96
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,640
Anyways guys, they kept me on set, obviously, a lil' longer than I would've liked..

97
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,900
And now, we're here and...

98
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,460
Logan... can I go home?.. D:

99
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:13,020
Jeff, no, you gotta vlog with me bro, reaction video... come on Jeffery.

100
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:17,820
Logang, I've been vlogging for 308 days straight, no way I'm going to stop now.

101
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:21,620
Daily content, I don't care what it is or what I'm doing, I'M PUTTING IT OUT BRO~

102
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:26,720
Jeff has been my manager, throughout my internet career, 4/5 years maybe even.

103
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,020
So, these are going to take us back, getting into the young, young, young... age videos...

104
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:36,000
You can actually, a good fun fact... but you'll probably cut it, we go all the...

105
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,640
OK guys, I'm kind of an ass-hole, I've been an ass-hole my entire life, including when I was younger...

106
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,660
I did a lot of prank calls... This is one of those..

107
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,700
Look at those braces... ahhh F#£$..

108
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,700
Oh... Good one, Buttski

109
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,460
You had a friend to help you spell that...

110
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:08,260
This is savage... YO.. I was a savage... I love how I thought.. Butts were so funny...

111
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,480
'Buttski is so funny~'

112
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,380
Little kids love buttski?~ How old were you in this?

113
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,480
I was probably 11... keeeh... Buttski...

114
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,460
Jeff still thinks it's funny..

115
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,820
Right now, I was thinking of a joke, because like, I wasn't sure what to do, I wasn't quick-witted...

116
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,320
I wasn't that funny, I was a goofball, so I just did this.

117
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,280
HAHAHAHA~ Butthead, that's a (inaudible)

118
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,620
And the foghorn! And the foghorn~

119
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:47,700
Bro~ everyone loved butts, 'Butthead Street' dhuuuud~

120
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:54,880
Definitely could've though of something better.. Bro, look, it took time to craft this piece of perfection you're looking at now bro...

121
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:00,720
We also... sold merch... What da heck? In the day, we used to... how many did you sell?

122
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,040
2. And they were both from my cousins... Here's what that looked like.

123
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:14,020
No, I don't know.. Look at it!.. WHATTTTT~?!

124
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:18,100
Why did I think that was cool... I didn't even design it myself...

125
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,080
On Word-art?... Yes...

126
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,260
Bro, but look at it, the merch is on fire today, look at the logo behind you...

127
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:27,640
May favourite hat, I don't wear anything else. Its the best.

128
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,460
Look, it takes time to progress guys.

129
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:35,420
Here's a fun fact, you guys see like the...real life fruit ninja videos on the internet...

130
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:42,420
and not even kidding... before that was a thing, I literally made the first one, I swear on my life...

131
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,920
5 years ago... Check this out.

132
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,960
Oooooh... what a face~ THE INTENSITY.

133
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,840
How'd you make those faces?

134
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,880
I'M A BEAST! I sliced the cucumbers bro!~

135
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:57,020
That's all I can show... Because of music copyight purposes, but I hope you enjoyed...

136
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:02,580
Oh no... Wait! Yeah, yeah... when I first got Maverick. This is like when I first got Maverick like 5 years ago.

137
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:08,420
What am I doing... What am I looking at? Wait for it...

138
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,080
MAVERICK THE PARROT!~

139
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:16,300
Yo~ guys... look at his wings, Maverick's wings were green when I first got him...

140
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,560
We're just going to skip to the end here...

141
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,960
Maverick... waves.. and I lose the staring contest.

142
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:27,200
Yo... are you F#£$%@& kidding me bro~? Like.. this was like 4/5 years ago...

143
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:32,020
You had a lot of time on your hands... I had a lot of time and I got to say... Things have chaaaanged~

144
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,860
I don't even know what I was saying bro...

145
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:50,300
Yo, you know whats crazy... this was after puberty, like this... you can tell it's me...

146
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:55,160
2013... I was just wasn't funny... That's all. I thought that was pretty funny...

147
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,720
Wha... wHA... WhAt Do I dO?~

148
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,980
Here's the background, I told the guy my bird flew into the wall and his eyeball fell out from its eye socket...

149
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,540
So... let's watch...

150
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,540
I'm a F#$%^&@ idiot

151
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,880
This guy is still on the phone... I don't know, but you don't want to know right now...

152
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:31,820
I'm going to do a little throwback and call someone that's open.. prank call them a little bit...

153
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:35,820
Open for business? Yeah... like... Taco Bell is definitely open, right?

154
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,100
I don't think they take calls bro...

155

00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:10,300
*He literally, got one eye...*

164

*I can bring him there, it might take a bit.. but I don't even have a skateboard*

165
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,240
I can't do the same voice... I can't do the same voice...

166
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:26,980
*Is there anyway you can put his eyeball back from over there?*

167
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:33,240
*Do you have... Do you have bird glasses?*

00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,660

00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:59,260
Poor lady... she just wanted to help get my bird's eye back in its socket...

174
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,400
OK, lets what another video~

175
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,820
So guys, like I said, I made videos when I was younger.. and I made this like..

176
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,300
'big' comeback when we were older, and had gone through puberty.

177
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,120
Well... maybe not Jake... but me...

178
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,640
This was like.. our announcement video.. like, 'WE'RE COMING BACK'.

179
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:15,820
Look at Jake~

180
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,960
I was such a bad actor...

181
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,680
I think you're going through puberty, not, went through it.

182
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:29,780
Yeah, I know... Definitely. I was in a weird phase, my face was swollen, my nose was big..

183
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:43,720
Jake hasn't changed at all dude... He still thinks he's a thug, and he's still a whiny ass bitch...

184
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:53,300
I'm just kidding guys, I love Jake. He was a whiny bitch, he was a little thug dude, like... this kid was the baller...

185
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,860
You were kinda awkward... I was awkward

186
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,720
How can a human being go... 'We're really excited...'

187
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,420
DO I LOOK F#£$%@& EXCITED TO YOU BRO?~

188
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:12,060
This video is bad... This video is... Goddammit...

189
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,680
Here's the moral of the story... We're done watching this.

190
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,800
Please, I want to go home and watch them.

191
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,420
I'm removing them right now... I'm deleting them.

192
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,300
It's got 70,000 views... and it's gone.

193
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,200
OK, this vlog's done. COMEON....

194
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:32,460
