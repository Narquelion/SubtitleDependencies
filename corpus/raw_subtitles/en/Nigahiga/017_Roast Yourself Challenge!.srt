00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
Hey guys! So if you follow what's going on in the YouTube community

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,700
and I'm not just talking about my channel, I'm talking about like all of YouTube

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,320
You've probably seen some, or at least heard of some YouTube drama

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,200
And by drama I mean like you know, YouTubers fighting online

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,000
And it's all public for everyone to see

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,880
And I'm pretty sceptic so at first you know I thought these YouTubers were pairing up and agreeing to have drama

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,600
So that you know it would create some publicity for them and honestly, we'll never know

8
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,680
But I think it's real! I think it's 100% real

9
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:25,720
I mean they're not just like tweeting like snide, passive aggressive remarks

10
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,100
They are literally calling each other out

11
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,340
They are making dedicated vlogs to like talk crap about each other

12
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,520
I've even seen some YouTubers make raps about each other

13
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:35,600
Like it's some kind of "Rap battle", like the whole Drake and Meek Mills thing

14
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,480
And I'm just sitting here thinking

15
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:38,980
I feel a little left out

16
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,540
I want to be part of the Drama life!

17
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,720
I- I- I can have beef with someone, I know how to roast

18
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,580
I've had roast beef

19
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,720
Like okay... uh. PewDiePie, more like Poo-diepie

20
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:49,860
Poop-diepie

21
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:50,660
is what I meant

22
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:51,820
Ohhhhh

23
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:52,920
ROASTED!!!

24
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,900
KSI? Uhhh what does that stand for?

25
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,060
kilopounds per square inch?

26
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,120
OOOOHHHH

27
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,660
GET REKT!

28
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,320
Jenna Marbles?

29
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:04,940
More like Jenna More Bowls

30
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:05,900
Of Poop

31
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:06,880
-Diepie

32
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,880
That's measured in KSI

33
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:12,300
OOOHHH

34
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,300
Why don't you apply some water?

35
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:14,880
Ointment...

36
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,880
On your burn...

37
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,580
Put the wa...

38
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,200
Put the water first...

39
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,540
Okay ya... a you can see I'm not a good roaster

40
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:22,800
I'm a great one

41
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,260
But as much as I want to be a part of the whole drama scene...like I don't want to fight with anyone

42
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,260
I don't like confrontations

43
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:32,260
I mean the closest thing to ever being a part of the drama life was literally when I made a draw my life

44
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,900
But back in the day when I first started, like 2005... 2006

45
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:38,060
Youtubers didn't really fight with each other, we all got along for the most part

46
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,740
We helped each other out, you know we supported one another. We all collabed.

47
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,020
And if there was drama you wouldn't necessarily see people posting about so publicly online.

48
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,100
I guess people are more open about that stuff these days

49
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,100
But it's obviously completely different now...

50
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:49,620
and I'm missing out,

51
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,180
which is why I came up with this idea

52
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,520
You probably already know it because of the title. It is the... ROAST YOURSELF CHALLENGE!!

53
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,520
It's easy to call out someone out on something or it's easy make fun of someone else.

54
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,700
We as humans naturally do that, were always judging other people.

55
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,820
He is so short

56
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,200
Ew, look at how that girl's dressed

57
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,560
Look at how fat that guy is

58
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,860
She needs to take off her makeup and put on some clothes.

59
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:12,820
The idea behind this challenge is basically to look at yourself as if you were another person, and then do exactly what the title says...

60
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:13,620
Roast Yourself

61
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,280
And like I said I-I don't how to do it exactly.

62
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,200
I think it's pretty open.

63
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,900
As long as you're roasting yourself, making fun of yourself then I think you've done it.

64
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,720
You could vlog roast yourself. You know literally do what I'm doing right now but talk bad about yourself.

65
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,140
You could create a clone character of yourself and have that character roast you...

66
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:33,220
or you could even do one of those rap battles with yourself like we mentioned earlier. Like the whole Meek Mills and Drake thing.

67
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,660
Except it be you just roasting you

68
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,960
I mean it is a little bit more work but I actually think that would be the most fun way to do it.

69
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,340
Anyway just do it however you want.

70
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,680
The only rule in this challenge is to make fun of yourself, it's to call yourself out.

71
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:50,420
Because like I said so many times before were always so quick to judge other people, but alot of times we don't even realise but we have just as many flaws as everyone else.

72
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,560
And once you realise and all yourself out on these flaws it's alot harder to make fun of someone else's flaws .

73
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,600
So lets stop the drama. Stop making fun of people, stop mocking and judging people and just take a long look at ourselves...

74
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,240
and just tear ourselves a new one. I'm Ryan Higa and this is the 'Roast Yourself Challenge'.

75
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,660
See? When you roast yourself no one gets hurt. It's a good challenge.

76
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,080
I'm just trying to make the world a better place.

77
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,960
*sob*

78
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,580
So like I said earlier, the next time you feel the need to make fun of someone, take a look at yourself first.

79
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:48,280
If you're go and judge for something then go ahead but know that you're not perfect either and you should be judging yourself as well.

80
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:52,860
And just like any challenge I'm gonna be doing some call out to Youtubers who I want to see roast themselves.

81
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:57,100
But it doesn't mean that you guys can't do it either. In fact I look forward to seeing a bunch of you guys do your own roast.

82
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,100
In fact ya. I'm calling all of you guys out aswell.

83
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:06,640
Anyways, specifically I'm going be calling out a bunch of my friends to do this challenge that I think not only would be good at it but these are all people I think that aren't afraid to make fun of themselves

84
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,440
and I think for this challenge you have to be pretty confident cause you have to be comfortable calling out your flaws.

85
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,000
So with that being said... I'm calling out the following people.

86
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,520
Jenna Marbles

87
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,040
D-Trix

88
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,540
Pewdiepie

89
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,040
KSI

90
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,000
Timothy DeLaGhetto

91
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,020
IISuperWomanII

92
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:16,760
and Jeremy Lin

93
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:20,440
If I didn't call out a outuber you guys want to see roast themselves as well then you call them out.

94
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,980
Go leave them some tweets or comments or whatever.

95
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,820
With that being said ``Thank you guys so much for watching``

96
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,640
Looking forward to seeing all you guys roast yourselves.

97
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:32,520
Oh ya and if you guys want to buy this, you know this epic smash hit rap diss track on Itunes... you can't. Cause I'm not going to put it on there.

98
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,880
OOHHHH!!!!
