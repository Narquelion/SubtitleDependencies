1
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:37,500
Alright...

2
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,320
Fandom name, group color, new song

3
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,040
That's all we gotta figure out today. Easy!

4
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,520
Why're we doing this again?

5
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,900
That's what we need in order to be a K-pop band

6
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,260
Says who?

7
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,420
Everyone! The comments, uh, Google?

8
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,500
The hell's a fandom name?

9
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,480
A fandom name is basically what the fans call themselves

10
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:52,980
Right

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,500
Y'know like,

12
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,460
Justin Bieber's fans are called Beliebers

13
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,100
Uhm, don't we all ready have a fandom name?

14
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:57,960
The BgA ARMY?

15
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,800
According to the comments,

16
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,580
That's already taken by some other group called, like,

17
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,480
"Behind the Scenes" or whatever

18
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:07,140
Well, since our first and only song is about poop...

19
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,360
Again, thank you for that David

20
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,180
What?

21
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,760
Maybe sumthin like uh...

22
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,280
K-poopers?

23
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:13,920
Yeah

24
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,820
Yeah, that makes sense.

25
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:15,540
I don't care.

26
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,900
That's pretty cool, but uhm

27
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,420
Do you think the fans would like being called poopers? [Well,

28
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,440
FUCK YEA!

29
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:25,580
Uhm, okay

30
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:28,940
Yeah, most of the fans are girls and girls like poop jokes so...

31
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,420
Cool. Alright, we got our fandom name

32
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,360
Uh, next thing on the list...

33
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,320
We got group color

34
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,540
I'm just gonna throw it out there

35
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,120
I personally like silver

36
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:36,780
I could do silver

37
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:37,280
Right?

38
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,680
But that's like, second place.

39
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:39,640
What?

40
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,620
Gold is first, silver is second

41
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,820
*snaps fingers* Gold, GOLD THO

42
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,740
I look good in gold, ya know what I'm sayin'?

43
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,980
Y'know, you know what I mean

44
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,200
No. No, I don't know what you are saying

45
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,320
So what color do you wanna choose?

46
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,300
Gold

47
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:54,540
Oh, me too

48
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,980
Okay, we have two for gold, two for silver.

49
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:57,960
Jun, be our tie-breaker.

50
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,600
I'm- I'm fine with either

51
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,940
Yes, so which one do you prefer?

52
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,680
Yeah, which one is better, gold or silver?

53
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,220
Obviously gold, right?

54
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,440
Don't you dare convince him

55
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,000
Pick one, you idiot

56
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,520
C-can we do both?

57
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,760
Yeah, I don't see why not

58
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,020
Actually, I've never really thought of that before

59
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,980
Yeah, I've never seen two colors...

60
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,700
Yeah, we could have, like, the glowsticks that K-pop groups have?

61
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,500
Like, a silver and gold option...

62
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,880
Yeah, and then we could have our logos like "BgA" or sumthin' like that

63
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,400
Oh god, that is the dumbest idea ever

64
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,920
Silver and gold doesn't even go together

65
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,900
Who's gonna buy these glowsticks?

66
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,020
I'm not putting my money in for that garbage, man

67
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,400
Look, y'know what? We'll just come back to it 'cuz it's not that important.

68
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,400
What we really need to figure out...

69
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,020
New Song

70
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,860
We've haven't had a song since last year

71
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:37,220
Well whatever it's about, I better get some lines in this one because you took all the lines last time

72
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,060
Obviously. I'm the leader

73
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:38,900
*scoffs*

74
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,180
You're the leader?! Are you kidding me? I'm obviously the lead

75
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,860
Have you not read my Twitter feed? They all say so

76
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,780
Have YOU read the comments? You're like everybody's least favorite

77
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:48,920
Yeah, because you hog all the lines!

78
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,780
Okay, I'm pretty sure Jun is everyone's least favorite

79
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,600
I don't care about being the leader. I just better be higher than Jun, 'kay?

80
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,420
I think I'm about the second place 'cuz I like silver

81
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,100
What, silver?! You just said that you like gold.

82
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,860
Now you're flip-flopping but all of a sudden...

83
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:07,920
*random gibberish*

84
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,420
ALRIGHT, alright!

85
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:09,920
okay

86
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,940
We're not gonna get anywhere like this

87
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,020
There's only one way of figuring out who the leader is

88
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:13,880
How?

89
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,980
We make a song, with everybody in it, equally

90
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,520
And then we just see what happens

91
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,620
Okay but what's the song gonna be about?

92
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,120
Exactly what we've been talking about the entire time

93
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,680
Who's it gonna be?

94
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,220
Oh. My. God.

95
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,200
That better not be the name of the song!

96
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,440
That is so chees-

97
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,560
*song starts*

98
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,180
K-poopers, where you at?

99
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,680
BgA

100
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:41,980
Let's go

101
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,140
*door opens*

102
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,760
Jun? Is that really you?

103
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,140
Wait, what are you guys doing?

104
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,880
Why do you look like that?

105
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,540
Look man... we're happy for you

106
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,440
We really are.

107
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,680
But, ever since you left the group

108
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,540
It's been really tough for the rest of us

109
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:37,920
Yeah, we've just been doing what we all can to get by

110
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,440
But, it's only been one week

111
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,260
Oh

112
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,680
Well, it's been a really tough week

113
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,920
Yeah yeah, seven days, long time

114
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,000
Why are you even talking to this traitor?!?!

115
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:51,700
HE LEFT US!

116
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,360
YOU! LEFT! US!

117
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,340
We know all about your talking to the manager and your little contract

118
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,100
So why are you even here?

119
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,500
Actually...

120
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,480
That's exactly why I'm here

121
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:16,240
This pretty much guarantees me fame, money and everything that we've been working for together as a group

122
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:20,320
But it says I have to do it alone, without you guys

123
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:26,080
Which is why I felt the need to come here and... do this

124
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,640
What's the point of fame and fortune if it's not with your guys?

125
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,620
Dude

126
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,780
The hell were you thinking, man?!

127
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,280
What?

128
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,820
Yeah, you could have taken the money and shared it with us!

129
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,580
Why would you even rip this man? Come on!

130
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,160
What're we gonna do now?

131
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,400
Do you think we can put this back together or what?

132
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,400
Like, if we could tape it

133
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,280
Glue! I have some glue in the car

134
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,740
Do you? Okay, then let's try to see if we have all the pieces like...

135
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,260
Hey.

136
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,820
Are those- *shocked* - Are those the glowsticks?

137
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,800
Told you... gold and silver...doesn't match

138
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,380
Tch, idiot

139
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,180
Aah, aah

140
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,980
Aaand it's--- SIGN SIGN SIGN SIGN! Sign right here!

141
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,580
Sorry guys, it's-it's gone

142
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,740
There. It's good. Let it go

143
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,060
Guys, it's in my email, I could print it out.

144
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,080
You're so--- *smacks*

145
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,220
TEEHEE
