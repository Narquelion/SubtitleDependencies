00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:01,500
-Have you ever happened to this?

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,125
I spilled table all over my liquids!

3
00:00:06,448 --> 00:00:07,791
Well, that's perfectly normal.

00:00:11,083 --> 00:00:11,875
Not the Teehee Band,

7
00:00:11,875 --> 00:00:13,291
the Teehee! Band. Say it like that.

8
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:15,083

10
00:00:16,917 --> 00:00:18,500

00:00:19,957 --> 00:00:21,917
but it give you another fist. [pow!]

13
00:00:21,917 --> 00:00:23,292

15
00:00:24,417 --> 00:00:27,332

16
00:00:27,332 --> 00:00:29,375

17
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:30,792
and figure out the end of pi.

18
00:00:30,792 --> 00:00:32,786

00:00:36,957 --> 00:00:38,167
might not come true!

23
00:00:38,167 --> 00:00:39,082
