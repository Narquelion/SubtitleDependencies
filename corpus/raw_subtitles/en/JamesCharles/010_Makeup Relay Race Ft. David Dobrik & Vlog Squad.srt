1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,490
- [Crowd] Hi sisters!

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:03,619
- James Charles here and welcome back

3
00:00:03,619 --> 00:00:04,870
to my YouTube channel.

4
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:05,940
As you guys can see I'm joined

5
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,055
with quite a few sister special guests, the Vlog Squad!

6
00:00:09,055 --> 00:00:10,555
- [Crowd] Woo hoo!

7
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,583
- Oh my god you guys I am so beyond

8
00:00:12,583 --> 00:00:13,872
excited for today's brand new video

9
00:00:13,872 --> 00:00:15,370
because I feel like we've been trying to plan

10
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:17,050
this for a long period of time.

11
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:18,389
- I'm surprised you got all of us in here.

12
00:00:18,389 --> 00:00:19,440
- I know.

13
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,273
- That's tough.

14
00:00:20,273 --> 00:00:21,691
- And Jonah was almost on time.

15
00:00:21,691 --> 00:00:22,690
(laughing)

16
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:23,523
- He was earlier than all of you

17
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:24,807
- I know I just wanted to make him look bad.

18
00:00:24,807 --> 00:00:26,140
(laughing)

19
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,838
- So for today's video I have a very fun and fresh

20
00:00:27,838 --> 00:00:29,670
make-up challenge planned that I just thought of a few

21
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:30,503
days ago and I was like wow,

22
00:00:30,503 --> 00:00:32,410
I think this needs to happen.

23
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:34,960
And that is a new challenge that we're doing here called

24
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,294
make-up relay.

25
00:00:36,294 --> 00:00:37,377
- [Crowd] Oh.

26
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,616
- Thank you so much for all the special infatuation .

27
00:00:40,616 --> 00:00:41,990
(laughing)

28
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:43,830
- So basically you're all working together as a team

29
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,740
but you don't really get to actually work together

30
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,278
and you just have to hope that it all comes out good

31
00:00:47,278 --> 00:00:48,111
in the end.

32
00:00:48,111 --> 00:00:50,260
So like you're only as strong as your weakest link.

33
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:51,350
- Oof Jonah.

34
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:53,600
(laughing)

35
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,900
- Basically what we're going to do is we have nine of

36
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:57,860
the Vlog Squad members here,

37
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,630
we're gonna put everybody's names in a hat

38
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:01,376
and pick everybody at a random order,

39
00:01:01,376 --> 00:01:04,610
and each person is going to have five minutes alone

40
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:05,443
with me.

41
00:01:05,443 --> 00:01:06,318
- [Crowd] Aah.

42
00:01:06,318 --> 00:01:07,334
(laughter)

43
00:01:07,334 --> 00:01:08,584
- Jeff gets 10.

44
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:12,164
- Jeff gets as much time as he needs.

45
00:01:12,164 --> 00:01:13,020
(laughter)

46
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,520
I'm gonna lay out all the make-up products that I have

47
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,940
in my everyday make-up routine,

48
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:17,835
and you all will have five minutes to do

49
00:01:17,835 --> 00:01:19,243
as much as you can.

50
00:01:19,243 --> 00:01:20,076
- Done

51
00:01:20,076 --> 00:01:20,909
- Easy peasy baby.

52
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:21,742
- Let's do it.

53
00:01:21,742 --> 00:01:23,000
- Five minutes that's nothing.

54
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,470
- Everybody will rotate in and out while I ask everybody

55
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:26,220
questions about being in the vlogs.

56
00:01:27,468 --> 00:01:28,301
And that's about it.

57
00:01:28,301 --> 00:01:29,134
(laughter)

58
00:01:29,134 --> 00:01:30,740
And also just glamming me up, but hopefully

59
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,696
by the end of this we'll see if the Vlog Squad is able

60
00:01:32,696 --> 00:01:33,616
to work together,

61
00:01:33,616 --> 00:01:35,161
to put a beautiful make-up look on me.

62
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:37,024
- You're gonna look like a clown.

63
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:39,000
(laughter)

64
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,136
- I actually want you guys to try really really hard

65
00:01:41,136 --> 00:01:42,456
to make it look good.

66
00:01:42,456 --> 00:01:43,340
- Uh huh.

67
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,760
- How does everyone feel about their skill level

68
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,290
when it comes to make-up?

69
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:47,700
- I'm a solid seven and a half.

70
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,533
- I'm a three and a half.

71
00:01:48,533 --> 00:01:50,751
- He's just really good at painting.

72
00:01:50,751 --> 00:01:53,420
- Okay.

73
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,725
- I feel like out of the entire group I'm the worst at it.

74
00:01:55,725 --> 00:01:56,558
- Really?

75
00:01:56,558 --> 00:01:57,660
- Yeah, because Jeff does like beauty stuff.

76
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,090
- Did I tell you guys I'm the number one stylist

77
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,090
on Famous Birthdays?

78
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:00,923
- Holy shit.

79
00:02:00,923 --> 00:02:01,820
- You're so famous.

80
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,819
- You said it like four times on the way over here.

81
00:02:04,819 --> 00:02:07,940
- I think, I think, I think you'll be pretty good

82
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,130
because you always do your make-up for when we

83
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:10,963
film with you.

84
00:02:10,963 --> 00:02:12,340
(laughter)

85
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,576
- You're just so pretty.

86
00:02:13,576 --> 00:02:14,410
- Oh my god.

87
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:16,410
- We have numbers one through nine listed right here

88
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,184
in the original James Charles disgusting leather

89
00:02:18,184 --> 00:02:20,784
baseball hat that I wore on my head for too long.

90
00:02:20,784 --> 00:02:23,025
- Cool, I almost looked, I almost ruined it.

91
00:02:23,025 --> 00:02:24,344
- We're all trying to pick at once.

92
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:25,310
- Okay who's going first?

93
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,350
- What's the best, one?

94
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:27,183
- One.

95
00:02:27,183 --> 00:02:28,016
- Woo!

96
00:02:28,016 --> 00:02:30,528
(screaming)

97
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:31,394
- Lucky bitch!

98
00:02:31,394 --> 00:02:32,350
- Okay Heath is first.

99
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:34,051
Okay so we might be off to a good start then.

100
00:02:34,051 --> 00:02:34,884
- That's pretty good.

101
00:02:34,884 --> 00:02:35,717
- Yeah.

102
00:02:35,717 --> 00:02:37,203
- You can play with the foundation Heath.

103
00:02:37,203 --> 00:02:38,036
- Carly's two.

104
00:02:38,036 --> 00:02:39,010
- I'm scared.

105
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:39,843
- Who's number three?

106
00:02:39,843 --> 00:02:40,717
- I'm three sister, it's me.

107
00:02:40,717 --> 00:02:42,077
- Wow, Zane you're the best, okay four?

108
00:02:42,077 --> 00:02:42,910
- Me.

109
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:43,877
- Perfect.

110
00:02:43,877 --> 00:02:44,797
(laughter)

111
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:45,630
- Five?

112
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,463
- Me.

113
00:02:46,463 --> 00:02:47,340
- Okay Matt, six?

114
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,173
- Me.

115
00:02:48,173 --> 00:02:49,127
- Okay, so famous.

116
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,333
- Seven?

117
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:52,826
- Oh sorry, me!

118
00:02:52,826 --> 00:02:53,659
(laughter)

119
00:02:53,659 --> 00:02:54,492
I'm seven!

120
00:02:54,492 --> 00:02:55,325
- Eight?

121
00:02:55,325 --> 00:02:56,450
- Me.

122
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:57,283
I'm nervous.

123
00:02:57,283 --> 00:02:58,116
- Am I nine?

124
00:02:58,116 --> 00:02:59,918
(applause)

125
00:02:59,918 --> 00:03:02,502
- Alone time, alone time.

126
00:03:02,502 --> 00:03:04,040
- You get to spend the most time with him.

127
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,766
- So your make-up is perfectly done for our date after.

128
00:03:06,766 --> 00:03:07,686
(laughter)

129
00:03:07,686 --> 00:03:10,079
Without further ado are you guys all ready to race?

130
00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:11,246
- [Crowd] Yes.

131
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:21,480
- Alright you guys so Heath is starting us off today.

132
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,313
- Oh my god.

133
00:03:22,313 --> 00:03:23,715
- We have five minutes on the clock.

134
00:03:23,715 --> 00:03:24,723
- Did you do a start yet dude?

135
00:03:24,723 --> 00:03:25,556
- No, no.

136
00:03:25,556 --> 00:03:26,389
- Okay, okay cool.

137
00:03:26,389 --> 00:03:27,222
- Are you ready?

138
00:03:27,222 --> 00:03:28,963
- No, let me just scan this real quick see what we

139
00:03:28,963 --> 00:03:30,040
got to work with.

140
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,400
- I'm gonna give you a hand and say that the first

141
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,100
step is easy.

142
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,292
- Primer foundation we got this.

143
00:03:34,292 --> 00:03:36,780
- Okay, okay.

144
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:37,613
- I've seen a couple tutorials maybe.

145
00:03:37,613 --> 00:03:39,110
- Okay, okay ready?

146
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:39,943
- Yeah.

147
00:03:39,943 --> 00:03:40,813
- Ready?

148
00:03:40,813 --> 00:03:42,410
- My guilty pleasure is like watching Instagram like

149
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:43,630
quick makeovers.

150
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,870
You know like the minute long - Yes!

151
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,783
- I don't know why, that and haircut videos I just I'll

152
00:03:46,783 --> 00:03:49,620
just end up like - Wow, so this might be okay!

153
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,930
- Maybe this is my calling it's my first time.

154
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,173
- Okay, yeah you're gonna be so good at this.

155
00:03:52,173 --> 00:03:53,023
Are you ready?

156
00:03:53,023 --> 00:03:54,540
Five minutes on the clock.

157
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,373
- Okay.

158
00:03:55,373 --> 00:03:56,780
- Ready, set, go!

- Thank you.

162
00:04:00,743 --> 00:04:01,820
- Oh wow.

163
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,653
- Oh shit!

164
00:04:02,653 --> 00:04:04,034
I thought it was clean.

165
00:04:04,034 --> 00:04:05,628
Lather this up.

166
00:04:05,628 --> 00:04:06,461
- Yeh.

167
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:09,160
- That was a lot.

168
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,330
We'll just smooth it out, we'll smooth it out.

169
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,460
- Okay, okay I love it.

170
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,293
- Hang in there.

171
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:13,126
- I love a good smoothing out.

172
00:04:13,126 --> 00:04:13,959
- Sorry I'm pushing really hard.

173
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:15,150
- It's okay, how do you think you're gonna do with

174
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,300
this make-up portion today?

175
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,133
Like, are you excited?

176
00:04:17,133 --> 00:04:18,030
- I think I'm gonna do good,

177
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:20,289
I feel like I would really shine in the like

178
00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:23,300
color popping, getting around the eyes you know?

179
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,133
- Okay.

180
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:25,615
- But, I mean you know this is the

181
00:04:25,615 --> 00:04:28,711
key starting point right here.

182
00:04:28,711 --> 00:04:29,911
- Ow!

183
00:04:29,911 --> 00:04:31,290
- What?

184
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,630
- I think I just broke my toe.

185
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:34,870
I really think I just broke it.

186
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,550
- Oh a little dabble here and there.

187
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:37,700
- We don't wanna cake it on

188
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,584
- No.

189
00:04:38,584 --> 00:04:39,417
- We want a nice simple clean look.

190
00:04:39,417 --> 00:04:40,620
- Of course, of course.

191
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,520
- So right here we're just gonna go around the brows.

192
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,353
- Yeah.

193
00:04:43,353 --> 00:04:45,220
- Just tying that in, we don't wanna get to far in there

194
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,670
but then kinda blot it,

195
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:47,980
you don't want it to smear.

196
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:48,813
- Right, Heath?

197
00:04:48,813 --> 00:04:49,646
- Yeah.

198
00:04:49,646 --> 00:04:51,415
- How long have you been in the Vlog Squad for?

199
00:04:51,415 --> 00:04:52,759
- Literally since the beginning, I was in

200
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,167
David's first video.

201
00:04:54,167 --> 00:04:55,160
- Really?

202
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:55,993
- Yeah.

203
00:04:55,993 --> 00:04:58,260
- So who was in the original, original?

204
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,093
Like who were the first ones.

205
00:04:59,093 --> 00:05:02,850
- It was like me, Zane, Alex

206
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,169
- So you're an OG you've been there since day one?

207
00:05:06,169 --> 00:05:07,002
- Mhm.

208
00:05:07,002 --> 00:05:09,380
We used to Vine together and then all of a sudden he got

209
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,740
this camera and was like I'm gonna start making

210
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:11,573
YouTube videos and we were like oh wow.

211
00:05:11,573 --> 00:05:13,750
He's like I don't know how long I'm gonna stick with it

212
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,750
but I'm gonna try it out.

213
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,583
- Yeah.

214
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:16,630
- And then he just did it.

215
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,870
What's great is that we're all actual friends.

216
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:19,703
- Yeah.

217
00:05:19,703 --> 00:05:20,920
- And we would stay friends, even if we weren't doing

218
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,430
social media which is really cool.

219
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,263
- That's so good.

220
00:05:23,263 --> 00:05:24,720
Even from being around you guys for a few minutes it's

221
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,860
very obvious that it's not just an act.

222
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,921
- Yeah, I love my friend group, they're the best.

223
00:05:28,921 --> 00:05:29,913
- Go.

224
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,250
- Very nice.

225
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,720
- So you were telling me you watch all of those Instagram

226
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,553
videos?

227
00:05:34,553 --> 00:05:36,760
- Yeah I just like scroll through like and not even on

228
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,041
purpose I don't look to find them but,

229
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:40,098
I'll just be going through and like one will pop up.

230
00:05:40,098 --> 00:05:43,390
Then I'll get sucked into this world of like 30 minutes

231
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,834
and like, wait, what?

232
00:05:44,834 --> 00:05:46,440
- The make-up videos on Instagram are stone-age.

233
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,545
- Yeah, I like seeing like a start and a finish.

234
00:05:48,545 --> 00:05:49,578
(alarm)

235
00:05:49,578 --> 00:05:50,411
(gasps)

236
00:05:50,411 --> 00:05:51,244
Shit!

237
00:05:51,244 --> 00:05:52,077
Speaking of finish.

238
00:05:52,077 --> 00:05:54,800
- Oh that's so good, okay well Heath

239
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,020
your work here is done.

240
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,951
Thank you so much for your five minutes of time.

241
00:05:57,951 --> 00:05:58,784
- Oh my god, thank you.

242
00:05:58,784 --> 00:06:00,570
- Unfortunately we now have to move on to team member

243
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:03,060
number two and let's see where they start off.

244
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,020
- Thank you for having me.

245
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,160
- Thank you.

246
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,087
- I can't wait to see the finished product.

247
00:06:06,087 --> 00:06:06,984
- See you in a little bit.

248
00:06:06,984 --> 00:06:08,120
- Number two has arrived!

249
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,953
- Welcome sister!

250
00:06:08,953 --> 00:06:09,786
- Hi

251
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:10,619
- What do we think so far?

252
00:06:10,619 --> 00:06:11,452
- I don't know

253
00:06:11,452 --> 00:06:12,285
- Okay.

254
00:06:12,285 --> 00:06:13,118
- I think he did your foundation,

255
00:06:13,118 --> 00:06:14,664
well he definitely did your foundation.

256
00:06:14,664 --> 00:06:15,497
(laughter)

257
00:06:15,497 --> 00:06:17,950
- Okay, so analyze your canvas, this is what we have

258
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:18,930
going on so far.

259
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,540
You're about to start in the relay race.

260
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,960
Carly, we're putting five minutes on the clock.

261
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,793
- Okay.

262
00:06:22,793 --> 00:06:23,738
- Are you ready to go?

263
00:06:23,738 --> 00:06:24,840
- Yeah.

264
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,673
- Okay.

265
00:06:25,673 --> 00:06:27,144
- Me doing my make up every morning, five minutes.

266
00:06:27,144 --> 00:06:30,160
- Would love to relate, okay ready?

267
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,610
3,2,1 go.

268
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:33,443
- Oh god bitch.

269
00:06:33,443 --> 00:06:35,300
Okay, so he did your foundation I think I need to

270
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,133
do concealer after.

271
00:06:36,133 --> 00:06:37,106
- Okay great.

272
00:06:37,106 --> 00:06:37,990
- Is this true or are you not gonna tell me?

273
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:38,823
- I can't tell you.

274
00:06:38,823 --> 00:06:40,103
- Oh, that's not concealer.

275
00:06:40,103 --> 00:06:41,410
Where is it?

276
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,960
Oh, I've never seen something so beautiful in my life.

277
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,793
- Okay, love that.

278
00:06:44,793 --> 00:06:47,327
- It is a Too Faced Born This Way we stan Lady GaGa,

279
00:06:47,327 --> 00:06:50,225
I don't know if she made this, I would assume

280
00:06:50,225 --> 00:06:51,058
- Yeah?

281
00:06:51,058 --> 00:06:51,970
- I don't even know if I'm doing this right.

282
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,495
- So you and Erin are kinda like a duo?

283
00:06:53,495 --> 00:06:54,370
- Yes.

284
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:55,770
- So like how long have you guys know each other for

285
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,230
and what brought you into the Vlog Squad.

286
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,900
- We've known each other for like five or

287
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,060
six years probably.

288
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:00,893
- Okay, cool.

289
00:07:00,893 --> 00:07:02,100
- And we started on Vine.

290
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:02,933
- Okay, love that.

291
00:07:02,933 --> 00:07:03,766
- So that's how we know everybody.

292
00:07:03,766 --> 00:07:05,567
- So everybody in the Vlog Squad started on Vine?

293
00:07:05,567 --> 00:07:06,400
- Most of us, like

294
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,233
I don't think Jeff,

295
00:07:07,233 --> 00:07:09,030
I don't know if Jeff did,

296
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:09,983
I'm sure you wanna know all about Jeff.

297
00:07:09,983 --> 00:07:11,560
- Yes I do.

298
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,690
- Sister snatched, like this probably doesn't look good

299
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,719
in real life but to me I'm killing it.

300
00:07:15,719 --> 00:07:16,757
- All that matters is that it looks good on camera.

301
00:07:16,757 --> 00:07:18,730
- I don't know I was really close with Zane,

302
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,030
like I'm so close with Zane, he's probably my

303
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:20,950
best friend out of,

304
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:21,810
like besides Erin.

305
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:22,665
Is this, am I doing this right?

306
00:07:22,665 --> 00:07:23,498
- I can't tell you.

307
00:07:23,498 --> 00:07:24,537
- But does it feel right?

308
00:07:24,537 --> 00:07:25,370
- Yes.

309
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:26,203
- Like in your bones?

310
00:07:26,203 --> 00:07:27,036
- Yes.

311
00:07:27,036 --> 00:07:27,869
- And on your face?

312
00:07:27,869 --> 00:07:28,702
- Yeah, my face feels amazing.

313
00:07:28,702 --> 00:07:30,180
What would you describe the filming process of the vlogs

314
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,013
looking like?

315
00:07:31,013 --> 00:07:32,350
What I've noticed is that even from being with you guys

316
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,213
quickly like everybody's very very quick on the spot.

317
00:07:34,213 --> 00:07:35,290
- Yeah.

318
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,110
- But I also saw David redo a few takes which,

319
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:38,100
duh, happens all the time in production.

320
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:38,933
- Right.

321
00:07:38,933 --> 00:07:40,870
- So like how would you say the filming process goes and

322
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,349
like how's being funny on camera?

323
00:07:42,349 --> 00:07:43,182
- It's weird.

324
00:07:43,182 --> 00:07:44,015
- I'm so bad at it.

325
00:07:44,015 --> 00:07:45,324
- So like, it's weird because everyone vlogs so differently.

326
00:07:45,324 --> 00:07:46,157
- Yeah.

327
00:07:46,157 --> 00:07:47,830
- David is very like funny, quick and then.

328
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:48,683
- Super fast.

329
00:07:48,683 --> 00:07:51,460
- Like honestly, most of the things happen actually happen

330
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,462
it's just that he didn't like catch it on time.

331
00:07:52,462 --> 00:07:53,295
- Yeah.

332
00:07:53,295 --> 00:07:55,262
- Or like someone's interrupting, so we do it again.

333
00:07:55,262 --> 00:07:56,095
- Yeah.

334
00:07:56,095 --> 00:07:57,717
- And then if it looks scripted, that's probably why.

335
00:07:57,717 --> 00:07:58,550
- Well yeah.

336
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,560
- I dunno, it's kinda stressful cos he's like

337
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,393
can you say that again?

338
00:08:00,393 --> 00:08:01,226
And then everyone is looking at you and you're like,

339
00:08:01,226 --> 00:08:02,956
I don't want to, I won't sound natural.

340
00:08:02,956 --> 00:08:03,943
- Yeah, it's always awkward yeah.

341
00:08:03,943 --> 00:08:05,460
- I think I need to bake you but I don't,

342
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,510
I've never baked.

343
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,343
- Okay.

344
00:08:07,343 --> 00:08:08,176
- Well not in this way.

345
00:08:08,176 --> 00:08:09,567
- You got one minute to figure it out.

346
00:08:09,567 --> 00:08:10,400
- Um, okay.

347
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,300
Oh, this is probably it.

348
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,533
Laura Mercier come through girl.

349
00:08:13,533 --> 00:08:14,660
(laughter)

350
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,493
- Come through girl.

351
00:08:15,493 --> 00:08:17,210
- I watch a lot of your videos I always see this

352
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:18,324
happening so I'm just gonna do this and pretend

353
00:08:18,324 --> 00:08:19,836
I'm on the same level.

354
00:08:19,836 --> 00:08:21,520
- So you're already a sister?

355
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,468
- I'm such a sister.

356
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:23,557
- I always see you guys tweeting me and it's

357
00:08:23,557 --> 00:08:24,556
always so cute.

358
00:08:24,556 --> 00:08:25,389
- Oh my god I'm obsessed with you.

359
00:08:25,389 --> 00:08:26,970
- Like this is like stressful for me,

360
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:27,805
like I'm nervous.

361
00:08:27,805 --> 00:08:28,638
- Why?

362
00:08:28,638 --> 00:08:29,471
- I don't know.

363
00:08:29,471 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm just like a fan too.

364
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,800
So it's just like what am I doing right now?

365
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,893
- Aw, do you watch a lot of make up videos?

366
00:08:33,893 --> 00:08:36,010
- I do, I think they're really soothing.

367
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,076
I like watching cos it's so interesting what people can

368
00:08:37,076 --> 00:08:38,349
do, like it's literally an art form.

369
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:40,012
- Yeah.

370
00:08:40,012 --> 00:08:40,845
- And so cool.

371
00:08:40,845 --> 00:08:41,678

00:08:41,678 --> 00:08:42,580

375
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,730

00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:47,430

377
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:48,483
It's just like something to.

378
00:08:48,483 --> 00:08:49,596
- It's funsies.

379
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:50,429
- Yeah.

380
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:51,262
- Yeah.

381
00:08:51,262 --> 00:08:52,095
- It's just art.

382
00:08:52,095 --> 00:08:53,371
- Alright, well thank you for doing step number two,

383
00:08:53,371 --> 00:08:55,307
but alas, your time is over.

384
00:08:55,307 --> 00:08:58,043
So we have to move on to Vlog Squad number, number three

385
00:08:58,043 --> 00:08:59,830
and continue this make-over.

386
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,107
So we'll see you in a little bit sister.

387
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:01,940
- Okay

388
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:02,880
I'll go get him.

389
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,713
- Okay.

390
00:09:03,713 --> 00:09:04,546
(thumping)

391
00:09:04,546 --> 00:09:06,390
- Come out, come out wherever you are.

392
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:08,430
- Zane, are you ready?

393
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,227
- Hi, hi sisters I'm here.

394
00:09:10,227 --> 00:09:11,710
It's nice seeing you again.

395
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:12,850
- I know I've missed you a lot.

396
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:13,683
- Missed you too.

397
00:09:13,683 --> 00:09:14,516
How've you been?

398
00:09:14,516 --> 00:09:16,140
- I've been the best in the last two days

399
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,000
since I haven't seen you.

400
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,833
- Good.

401
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,020
If I do the eyebrows I'm safe because

402
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,070
you don't have to really do anything to

403
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,340
the eyebrows before you draw in the eyebrows right?

404
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,360
- Correct.

405
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,322
I can't tell you but that is correct.

406
00:09:24,322 --> 00:09:25,377
(laughter)

407
00:09:25,377 --> 00:09:26,470
- Yeah so ill start on the eyebrows.

00:09:27,303 --> 00:09:28,750

00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,583

00:09:41,383 --> 00:09:42,905
- Oh you do have it, perfect.

419
00:09:42,905 --> 00:09:45,410
(laughter)

420
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:46,890
- Oh my god, are you nervous?

421
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,343
You are shaking a little bit.

422
00:09:48,343 --> 00:09:51,790
- A little bit, oh my god this does wonders huh?

423
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:52,623
- Are you just choking me a little bit?

424
00:09:52,623 --> 00:09:54,093
(laughter)

425
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:57,000
- Stand still, stand still.

426
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,130
- So after we did our collab did you feel a little bit

427
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:00,270
more prepared for this makeover today?

428
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:02,685
Where you paying attention at all?

429
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,485
Well I can't really pay attention to my own face really.

430
00:10:04,485 --> 00:10:05,318
- Okay.

431
00:10:05,318 --> 00:10:07,530
- Because when I was editing the video I didn't know

432
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:10,309
what you where doing so like it was just I was looking

433
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:11,142
for the funny moments

434
00:10:11,142 --> 00:10:11,975
- Right.

435
00:10:11,975 --> 00:10:12,808
- Or like the very genuine moments no really what

436
00:10:12,808 --> 00:10:13,641
you was doing to my face.

437
00:10:13,641 --> 00:10:14,474
- Okay

438
00:10:14,474 --> 00:10:15,307
- That really didn't.

439
00:10:15,307 --> 00:10:16,140
- So no you are not prepared.

440
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:16,973
- No I'm not prepared at all.

441
00:10:16,973 --> 00:10:18,390
I don't want to touch your face but

442
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,223
I need to touch your face.

443
00:10:19,223 --> 00:10:20,056
- Go for it , go for it.

444
00:10:20,056 --> 00:10:20,889
- Okay.

445
00:10:22,935 --> 00:10:24,493
- I don't want to touch your face, I don't

446
00:10:24,493 --> 00:10:25,326
want to fuck it up.

447
00:10:25,326 --> 00:10:26,520
- Why don't you just put your hand around my regular neck?

448
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:30,840
So we have been bonding recently because I am in love

449
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,673
with Jeff I think.

450
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:32,506
- Yeah

451
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:33,900
- If you think there's the possibility of me hooking up

452
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,320
with one of the Vlog Squad members who would you say

453
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,199
it would be and why?

454
00:10:37,199 --> 00:10:38,032
- Hmm.

455
00:10:38,032 --> 00:10:39,854
- I don't know about Jeff, I wouldn't put Jeff on the

456
00:10:39,854 --> 00:10:40,838
top of the list.

457
00:10:40,838 --> 00:10:41,860
(gasps)

458
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,400
but, I know somebody else.

459
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,560
- Who?

460
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,480
- Want to make a guess?

461
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,530
- Dirty Dom?

462
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:48,363
- Yep

463
00:10:48,363 --> 00:10:51,170
(laughter)

464
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:52,780
- No you know though when I went to your birthday party

465
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,160
which we talked about it your video?

466
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:54,993
- Yeah.

467
00:10:54,993 --> 00:10:55,990
- Dom tried to make out with me.

468
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:56,930
- He, are you serious?

469
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:57,763
- Yeah.

470
00:10:57,763 --> 00:10:59,449
- That's really funny but did you, did you let him?

471
00:10:59,449 --> 00:11:00,320
- No!

472
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,153
- Why not?

473
00:11:01,153 --> 00:11:01,986
- Its disgusting.

474
00:11:01,986 --> 00:11:02,819
- I know that's disgusting.

475
00:11:02,819 --> 00:11:03,652
(laughter)

476
00:11:03,652 --> 00:11:04,550
You have standards.

477
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,383
- I have standards.

478
00:11:05,383 --> 00:11:07,340
You know James, you know what this is starting

479
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,513
to look like how you used to do your eyebrows

480
00:11:08,513 --> 00:11:09,690
like three years ago.

481
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:10,590
- Zane!

482
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,423
- Not now.

483
00:11:11,423 --> 00:11:12,324
- Don't do that to me.

484
00:11:12,324 --> 00:11:13,500
- I know but I have to, I have to.

485
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,520
- What was your first impression meeting me?

486
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,960
- I thought you where actually going to be kind

487
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,496
of like stand offish.

488
00:11:18,496 --> 00:11:19,470
- Really?

489
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,460
and a little like Zane are you ready?

490
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,089

I can't I don't have time for this.

494
00:11:30,296 --> 00:11:31,510
- That did not happen though.

495
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:33,704
- No I thought you where going to be like that.

496
00:11:33,704 --> 00:11:34,776
That is what I was saying. It though you where going to

497
00:11:34,776 --> 00:11:35,609
be like that.

498
00:11:35,609 --> 00:11:36,442
- Oh

499
00:11:36,442 --> 00:11:37,440
- But you ended up being the complete opposite and

500
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,450
I felt really comfortable when I was in here and

501
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:40,980
I was really happy you are very nice.

502
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:41,920
- Oh you are.

503
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,307
- I remember on the way home I was telling Natalie

504
00:11:43,307 --> 00:11:46,112
dude I can't believe he was that nice, I thought he was

505
00:11:46,112 --> 00:11:46,945
going to be the complete opposite.

506
00:11:46,945 --> 00:11:47,960
- Really?

507
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,940

00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,026
- Uh oh.

551
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,580
- I'm number four.

552
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,630
- Yeah.

553
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:00,463
Hi Jonah.

554
00:13:00,463 --> 00:13:02,101
- Hey, what's going on?

555
00:13:02,101 --> 00:13:03,920
- So let's start by analyzing the face.

556
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,753
- Uh huh.

557
00:13:04,753 --> 00:13:07,880
- And see what's done, and what you wanna what's next.

558
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,710
- There's a lot of powder on your face.

559
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:10,543
- Okay.

560
00:13:10,543 --> 00:13:11,500
- It looks good to me.

561
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,333
- Okay.

562
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,358
- I've got a feeling I gotta make it look better.

563
00:13:13,358 --> 00:13:14,191
(laughter)

564
00:13:14,191 --> 00:13:15,130
- This is so true.

565
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:15,963
- Okay.

566
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:16,796
- I remember when everybody said you were gonna be the

567
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:17,807
weakest link in the intro you can't listen.

568
00:13:17,807 --> 00:13:19,065
- Did they say that?

569
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:20,010
- You where right there.

570
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:20,843
- Who said that?

571
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:21,676
- Everybody.

572
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:22,509
- What do ya mean?

573
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:23,342
(laughter)

574
00:13:23,342 --> 00:13:24,580
- Did you miss that?

575
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,480
- Did they actually say that about me?

576
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,313
- Yeah.

577
00:13:26,313 --> 00:13:29,370
So like, you're only as strong as your weakest link.

578
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:30,393
- Jonah.

579
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:32,830
(laughter)

580
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:34,291
- Just, just run your clock and I'll tell you what

581
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:35,124
I'm gonna do.

582
00:13:35,124 --> 00:13:35,957
- Okay, ready?

583
00:13:35,957 --> 00:13:37,000
- Yeah.

584
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,740
- Jonah, you've got five minutes on the clock.

585
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,819
- Oh Jesus, don't hate me, don't say it like that.

586
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:41,652
- Ready?

587
00:13:41,652 --> 00:13:42,485
- Yeah, ready.

588
00:13:42,485 --> 00:13:44,560
- 3,2,1 go.

589
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,908
Okay I have to tell you something funny okay?

590
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:46,741
- Okay.

591
00:13:46,741 --> 00:13:47,574
- When I first saw you in David's vlogs,

592
00:13:47,574 --> 00:13:48,795
I never watched any comedy ever.

593
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:50,819
So I really thought you were Jonah Hill for a second.

594
00:13:50,819 --> 00:13:51,652
- No.

595
00:13:51,652 --> 00:13:53,108
- I was like oh my god, David has Jonah Hill in his video.

596
00:13:53,108 --> 00:13:54,340
- You actually thought that?

597
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,173
- Yeah, swear to god.

598
00:13:55,173 --> 00:13:56,006
(laughter)

599
00:13:56,006 --> 00:13:57,844
And then I realized, not Jonah Hill.

600
00:13:57,844 --> 00:13:59,860
- He's a cool guy, Jonah's a cool guy.

601
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:00,795
Never met him but he's cool.

602
00:14:00,795 --> 00:14:01,628
- Okay.

603
00:14:01,628 --> 00:14:02,910
You know what else is cool?

604
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,330
Only having four minutes left.

605
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:05,163
Four minutes left.

606
00:14:05,163 --> 00:14:05,996
- Are you serious?

607
00:14:05,996 --> 00:14:06,829
You started the clock!

608
00:14:06,829 --> 00:14:07,662
- I told you

609
00:14:07,662 --> 00:14:08,495
- No, you're cheating.

610
00:14:08,495 --> 00:14:09,380
You were literally just in conversation with me.

611
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,628
- You were supposed to be going!

612
00:14:10,628 --> 00:14:15,240
- James, I have 4:21 now, come on.

613
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,270
Do we use water?

614
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,103
- No!

615
00:14:17,103 --> 00:14:17,936
- Is this perfume?

616
00:14:17,936 --> 00:14:18,769
- No.

617
00:14:18,769 --> 00:14:19,602
- What is this stuff?

618
00:14:19,602 --> 00:14:20,682
Your face just melts?

619
00:14:20,682 --> 00:14:22,220
(laughter)

620
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,053
It says.

621
00:14:23,053 --> 00:14:24,236
- Go, go do something.

622
00:14:24,236 --> 00:14:27,550
- You know what bro, I honestly do think you wasted

623
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,547
my time.

624
00:14:28,547 --> 00:14:30,540
And you asked me questions.

625
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,370
And you really tricked me into this.

626
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,290
- I told you I was gonna ask everybody questions.

627
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,920
So what would you say was the worst thing you've

628
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,030
had to do for the videos?

629
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,280
- Jumping the moped over the pool.

630
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,710
- That's dangerous.

631
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,010
Good, good, good choice.

632
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:41,843
Why do you think.

633
00:14:41,843 --> 00:14:42,676
- Is it?

634
00:14:42,676 --> 00:14:43,509
- Yes.

635
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:44,342
Why do you think you're so down to be

636
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:45,640
to do crazy things for the videos.

637
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,473
- I don't know dude,

638
00:14:46,473 --> 00:14:48,420
it's just like to the camera,

639
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,270
my blood just boils and I just wanna get really really

640
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,450
good content.

641
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:53,283
- Okay.

642
00:14:53,283 --> 00:14:54,116
- It just happens,

643
00:14:54,116 --> 00:14:54,949
this is for the eyes?

644
00:14:54,949 --> 00:14:56,170
- Uh huh.

645
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:58,210
- It feels like it is, cos there's like a little brush

646
00:14:58,210 --> 00:14:59,043
on there.

647
00:14:59,043 --> 00:15:00,221
Is it?

648
00:15:00,221 --> 00:15:01,800
- Yeah.

649
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,174
- You just didn't wanna say?

650
00:15:03,174 --> 00:15:04,193
- I'm scared.

651
00:15:04,193 --> 00:15:06,540
Okay, from what I've noticed from a lot of the videos,

652
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,730
is that, out of all the people I feel David tends to

653
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:11,343
surprise you the most with pranks and bets.

654
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:13,261
Do you live your life in constant fear?

655
00:15:13,261 --> 00:15:14,205
- Absolutely.

656
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:15,038
(laughter)

657
00:15:15,038 --> 00:15:16,326
I feel like this is a prank right here dude.

658
00:15:16,326 --> 00:15:19,215
- What do you think is gonna happen next?

659
00:15:19,215 --> 00:15:20,400
- I'm not sure.

660
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,840
- Oh my god the audition prank was,

661
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,940
broke my heart.

662
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:25,270
- Yeah, that shit prank broke me as a human.

663
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:27,020
- So you actually do do acting right?

664
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:27,920
- Yeah I'm an actor.

665
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,796
- Really?

666
00:15:28,796 --> 00:15:29,751
- I do comedy act, I mean yeah,

667
00:15:29,751 --> 00:15:31,184
it's what I'm trying to be I guess.

668
00:15:31,184 --> 00:15:32,017
- Okay.

669
00:15:32,017 --> 00:15:32,850
- A comedy actor.

670
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:33,683
- Okay.

671
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:34,516
- But no, the um.

672
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:35,349
(alarm)

673
00:15:35,349 --> 00:15:36,182
No, are you serious?

674
00:15:36,182 --> 00:15:37,358
I was almost done.

675
00:15:37,358 --> 00:15:38,191
(laughter)

676
00:15:38,191 --> 00:15:41,563
Stop, give me the make up!

677
00:15:43,252 --> 00:15:46,035
(clapping)

678
00:15:46,035 --> 00:15:47,840
- Oh my gosh, who.

679
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,010
Oh no.

680
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:50,843
- That's not good to hear.

681
00:15:50,843 --> 00:15:51,913
- I don't know I'm really a bit concerned about

682
00:15:51,913 --> 00:15:53,700
they eyes, I don't know.

683
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,076
I'm guessing Jonah did the eyes before this.

684
00:15:56,076 --> 00:15:56,909
- You'd be guessing correctly.

685
00:15:56,909 --> 00:15:58,010
- Oh no.

686
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:59,765
They're terrible, I feel so bad for you.

687
00:15:59,765 --> 00:16:02,970
Okay, I'm nervous, but I think I know what I'm doing.

688
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:05,804
I like to convince myself I know a lot about make-up.

689
00:16:05,804 --> 00:16:07,610
- Okay, so what, where you paying attention during

690
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:08,443
me and Zane's video?

691
00:16:08,443 --> 00:16:09,630
- Yeah a little bit.

692
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,621
- Okay, professional MUA.

693
00:16:11,621 --> 00:16:12,680
- So, I'm looking at you now,

694
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,680
I don't think you've done bronzing or contouring,

695
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,210
or even highlighting.

696
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:21,290
But, I think we have to start with bronzing first, right?

697
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:22,123
Right?

698
00:16:22,123 --> 00:16:22,956
- I can't tell you.

699
00:16:22,956 --> 00:16:26,430
- I think what, I think bronzing is when you focus

700
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:29,030
on the areas where the sunlight hits your face.

701
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,540
Or like where you?

702
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,373
Am I right?

703
00:16:31,373 --> 00:16:33,420
- You're a professional make-up artist Matt!

704
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,900
So you have five minutes on the clock.

705
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,733
- Okay.

706
00:16:35,733 --> 00:16:36,871
- Ready to get started and get as much of my glam done

707
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:38,420
as you can possibly can?

708
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,253
- Alright.

709
00:16:39,253 --> 00:16:40,384
- Are you ready?

710
00:16:40,384 --> 00:16:41,217
- Yes, yes.

711
00:16:41,217 --> 00:16:42,050
- Are you sure?

712
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:42,883
- Yes James I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready.

713
00:16:42,883 --> 00:16:44,250
- 3,2,1 go.

714
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:47,633
- Okay, I'll open up this palette and,

715
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,500
okay, well it seems like you use this one a lot though,

716
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,290
so actually I'm gonna go with this one.

717
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:54,315
- Okay cool.

718
00:16:54,315 --> 00:16:55,148
- Alright.

719
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:56,219
- How long have you been in the Vlog Squad for?

720
00:16:56,219 --> 00:16:58,400
- I don't know, like two years?

721
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,233
- Are you shaking?

722
00:16:59,233 --> 00:17:00,100
- Yes, I'm shaking!

723
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,107
I don't wanna mess up, I don't wanna make this any worse

724
00:17:02,107 --> 00:17:02,940
than what it already is.

725
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,430
- Okay, okay two years now?

726
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:05,322
- Yes, two years.

727
00:17:05,322 --> 00:17:06,802
- And how would you say it's changed your life?

728
00:17:06,802 --> 00:17:08,298
- It's changed my life,

729
00:17:08,298 --> 00:17:10,150
in many ways.

730
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:12,602
I'm so happy that I'm surrounded by friends,

731
00:17:12,602 --> 00:17:15,034
who have such a great sense of humor and like love

732
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,940
and support each other.

733
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,179
It's honestly like one big family.

734
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:19,012
- Yeah.

735
00:17:19,012 --> 00:17:20,395
- And I can't complain.

736
00:17:20,395 --> 00:17:21,779
- Well speaking of something good like what's your

737
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:22,920
favorite part about the blogs, cos I noticed

738
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,040
David likes, you guys definitely like to do lots of

739
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:25,970
positive things too.

740
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:27,252
- Yes.

741
00:17:27,252 --> 00:17:29,010
- Lots of free cars, lots of makeovers, fun things.

742
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:30,430
- Yeah, I think.

743
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:33,560
I guess my favorite thing is just having everybody laugh.

744
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,393
I don't know.

745
00:17:34,393 --> 00:17:35,226
- Yeah.

746
00:17:35,226 --> 00:17:36,450
- All the laughter and stuff, it's just non stop and

747
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:38,820
a lot of people say, oh no this is all fake it's just

748
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:39,700
all about the laughter.

749
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,727
No this was a genuine quick comedic.

750
00:17:42,727 --> 00:17:43,560
- Quick quip.

751
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,393
- Yeah.

752
00:17:44,393 --> 00:17:45,470
Everybody is, I mean it's like straight up like improv

753
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:47,780
and I love that the Vlog Squad keep you on your toes

754
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:48,613
and stuff.

755
00:17:48,613 --> 00:17:49,446
- Yeah.

756
00:17:49,446 --> 00:17:50,540
There's so much footage in one video.

757
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,790
It's always entertaining to watch.

758
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:54,440
- I feel like I'm wanting to do bronze but I'm like

759
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,936
contouring you with bronzer.

760
00:17:55,936 --> 00:17:56,959
- It's okay.

761
00:17:56,959 --> 00:17:58,175
- So don't hate me, don't hate me.

762
00:17:58,175 --> 00:17:59,008
- I love you.

763
00:17:59,008 --> 00:18:00,340
- I like that face, I keep thinking you're trying

764
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,173
to kiss me right now,

765
00:18:01,173 --> 00:18:02,006
but you're just.

766
00:18:02,006 --> 00:18:02,913
- That's number nine.

767
00:18:03,763 --> 00:18:05,770
- Maybe like a little bit of your chin.

768
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:08,400
It's important to also contour your jawline right?

769
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,303
To hide double chins.

770
00:18:09,303 --> 00:18:10,136
- Definitely.

771
00:18:10,136 --> 00:18:11,009
- We need to teach Zane that.

772
00:18:11,009 --> 00:18:12,020
(laughs)

773
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,280
I've done like okay on this side,

774
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,220
this side is looking pretty rough.

775
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,670
- Okay you have six seconds to fix it.

776
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:17,450
- It's not balanced, It's not balanced out.

777
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:18,283
- You have six seconds to fix it.

778
00:18:18,283 --> 00:18:20,663
- Okay, okay, okay.

779
00:18:20,663 --> 00:18:22,040
(alarm)

780
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,000
There we go.

781
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,214
- Are you, ok

782
00:18:24,214 --> 00:18:25,047
(laughs)

783
00:18:25,047 --> 00:18:25,880
Time.

784
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,713
- You know what I'm proud, you know?

785
00:18:26,713 --> 00:18:27,546
Dare to fail.

786
00:18:27,546 --> 00:18:28,379
- Right.

787
00:18:28,379 --> 00:18:29,212
- Thank you James.

788
00:18:29,212 --> 00:18:30,045
- Thank you so much Matt.

789
00:18:30,045 --> 00:18:30,878
- Thank you.

790
00:18:30,878 --> 00:18:32,799
- Okay bye, will you grab the next one?

791
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,220
- Yes.

792
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,940
Number six.

793
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,260
- Clean up crew is here.

794
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,550
- We need it.

795
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,244
- I liked you better without the make-up.

796
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,000
(laughs)

797
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,833
- Are you ready?

798
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:43,666
- Yeah.

799
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:44,920
- Okay, analyze your face.

800
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,910
- Oh, it's kind of a mess.

801
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:48,210
I didn't realize it was gonna be this bad.

802
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,560
Who screwed this up this bad?

803
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,771
- A lot of people.

804
00:18:51,771 --> 00:18:52,870
- Okay.

805
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:54,290
- We started pretty strong.

806
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:56,570
- This is why I didn't wanna go after Jonah.

807
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:58,870
Yeah, I have a lot to do, well.

808
00:18:58,870 --> 00:18:59,703
I'm glad I'm here.

809
00:18:59,703 --> 00:19:02,100
- Me too, thank you so much for joining us here today David.

810
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,940
- I see the foundation is set.

811
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:04,773
- Yeah.

812
00:19:04,773 --> 00:19:05,790
- A little bit of eyeliner.

813
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:07,963
I don't even know anything about make-up but I know

814
00:19:07,963 --> 00:19:09,235
this is completely wrong.

815
00:19:09,235 --> 00:19:10,620
(laughter)

816
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,870
Is there an eraser?

817
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:13,419
Where I can just erase it all.

818
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:14,252
We do have make-up wipes if you want something.

819
00:19:14,252 --> 00:19:15,843
- Okay, I'm going to

820
00:19:15,843 --> 00:19:17,347
- You're gonna have five minutes on the clock.

821
00:19:17,347 --> 00:19:18,490
Do you know what you wanna do next?

822
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,323
- Yeah, yeah.

823
00:19:19,323 --> 00:19:20,619
I wanna put something under your eyes.

824
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:21,670
- Okay.

825
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:23,890
- Because there's a lot going on,

826
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:25,447
and I kinda wanna balance it out.

827
00:19:25,447 --> 00:19:26,723
Cos right now I don't know where to look but I wanna

828
00:19:26,723 --> 00:19:27,955
just be looking in your eyes.

829
00:19:27,955 --> 00:19:29,230
- Okay.

830
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:30,086
Well David Dobrik, you're about to have five minutes

831
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:32,580
on the clock for this make-up relay.

832
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,611
- I only need two.

833
00:19:33,611 --> 00:19:35,920
- Great, are you ready to go?

834
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,060
- Yeah okay.

835
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,100
- Your time starts now.

836
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,150
- This is what I need.

837
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:41,170
- Oh the James Charles X Morphe iconic palette.

838
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:42,300
- I use this at home actually.

839
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,133
- For what?

840
00:19:43,133 --> 00:19:44,440
- For everything, every morning.

841
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,309
I'm glad you have it here because.

842
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,610
- Okay, great.

843
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:47,443
- Oh wow, yeah.

844
00:19:47,443 --> 00:19:49,900
- David, what made you wanna start the Vlog Squad

845
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,405
and do daily vlogs with everybody?

846
00:19:51,405 --> 00:19:52,238
- I mean.

847
00:19:52,238 --> 00:19:53,071
- Well almost daily.

848
00:19:53,071 --> 00:19:54,837
- I didn't go in thinking starting we're gonna make

849
00:19:54,837 --> 00:19:55,670
a Vlog Squad.

850
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:56,957
- Really?

851
00:19:56,957 --> 00:19:59,309
- This is so funny, I'm about to screw this up even more.

852
00:19:59,309 --> 00:20:00,934
- No don't, make it look good.

853
00:20:00,934 --> 00:20:02,590
- Cos we were all doing Vine together.

854
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:03,423
- Yeah.

855
00:20:03,423 --> 00:20:06,005
- So then we kinds just started YouTube just naturally.

856
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:06,843
- Yes.

857
00:20:06,843 --> 00:20:08,480
- Liza actually got me into vlogging,

858
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,477
because she had a vlog camera so I like wanted to

859
00:20:09,477 --> 00:20:10,780
give it a shot.

860
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,040
When I started vlogging, like,

861
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,140
it wasn't really forced.

862
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,741
Like I didn't feel like I had to do YouTube,

863
00:20:14,741 --> 00:20:16,429
to like survive.

864
00:20:16,429 --> 00:20:19,430
So like, we were just literally just having fun

865
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:20,833
and filming everything, so it was great.

866
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:23,100
- Then it just turned you into a big squad that films

867
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:23,933
all the time.

868
00:20:23,933 --> 00:20:24,766
- Yes, 100%.

869
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:27,380
- Speaking of, what does your normal filming schedule

870
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,590
look like and also how long does it take you to

871
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:29,720
edit your videos?

872
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,450
This is interesting to me, because you seem to film

873
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:32,283
a lot.

874
00:20:32,283 --> 00:20:33,116
- Sure, sure.

875
00:20:33,116 --> 00:20:35,570
Yeah, so I have three, three and half hours of footage

876
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:36,403
every vlog.

877
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:37,260
- Yeah.

878
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,430
- I'm gonna go up top a little bit.

879
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:39,263
- Okay.

880
00:20:39,263 --> 00:20:41,120
(laughter)

881
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,550
- I love going up top a little bit.

882
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,970
- It's also so crazy having a serious conversation

883
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:47,384
with you while I'm literally going

884
00:20:47,384 --> 00:20:49,420
(shrieking)

885
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,820
Yeah, so about three to three and a half hours of footage

886
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:55,305
of vlog, then it takes me like 12 hours to edit.

887
00:20:55,305 --> 00:20:56,940
Maybe 14?

888
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,232
This is so intimate.

889
00:20:58,232 --> 00:20:59,420
- Yes.

890
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,672
- Like doing somebody's make-up is like,

891
00:21:00,672 --> 00:21:03,511
I feel like I'm on date with you.

892
00:21:03,511 --> 00:21:04,560
- Oh hey, I love that.

893
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,391
- It feels like we're having sex.

894
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:07,224
- Oh.

895
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:09,190
I don't know about all that.

896
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:10,160
Suddenly your time is up.

897
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,660
- What was I saying before it got so hot in here.

898
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,352
You looked like you just got socked in the face.

899
00:21:14,352 --> 00:21:15,810
- David.

900
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:17,050
- I screwed it up, I'm sorry.

901
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:17,883
- It's okay.

902
00:21:17,883 --> 00:21:19,367
- Let me fix it real quick, how much time do I have?

903
00:21:19,367 --> 00:21:20,708
- Keep going, don't worry about it, just keep going

904
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:21,541
you have about two minutes left.

905
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:23,130
- I just need to blend it in that's honestly,

906
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:23,963
all I need to do.

907
00:21:23,963 --> 00:21:24,796
- Okay, okay.

908
00:21:24,796 --> 00:21:25,629
So it seems like when you're filming skits you tend to

909
00:21:25,629 --> 00:21:27,408
just record everything and take the best footage, right?

910
00:21:27,408 --> 00:21:28,450
- 100%

911
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:32,763
- So how do you even plan all the stuff out in the videos?

912
00:21:32,763 --> 00:21:34,177
Like what does the creative process look like, that's

913
00:21:34,177 --> 00:21:36,940
what I wanna know because as a beauty guru it's hard.

914
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:37,773
- Sure, sure.

915
00:21:37,773 --> 00:21:38,980
- To come up with new ideas all the time, but I feel

916
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,780
like you all do the craziest things every single

917
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:41,810
time it's a new vlog.

918
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:42,984
- Yeah, no there is no creative process.

919
00:21:42,984 --> 00:21:45,710
We literally have no ideas going into every video.

920
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:46,543
- Okay.

921
00:21:46,543 --> 00:21:48,810
- It's kinda just like you record whatever and then

922
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:50,950
you turn your days into a trailer.

923
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:51,783
- Yeah.

924
00:21:51,783 --> 00:21:52,750
- So you just put the best moments in.

925
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,583
- Okay.

926
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:54,990
That's such a fun way to look at it actually.

927
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:55,823
- It's like, it's like.

928
00:21:55,823 --> 00:21:58,540
I always say if you edit the movie Titanic down to

929
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,001
three minutes you can turn it into a comedy movie

930
00:22:00,001 --> 00:22:02,910
and that's like what my life is.

931
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:05,627
It's not necessarily, we're not like funnier than any other

932
00:22:05,627 --> 00:22:06,611
- A sinking ship, but you can make it funny

933
00:22:06,611 --> 00:22:07,444
- friend group.

934
00:22:07,444 --> 00:22:08,277
- Exactly.

935
00:22:08,277 --> 00:22:10,230
We're not like funnier than any other group, but , I

936
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:13,060
We just know how to put a funny video together.

937
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,240
Sometimes, and sometimes they suck.

938
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,073
- Cool I love that.

939
00:22:15,073 --> 00:22:17,348
- Honestly, I think this is better, do you know why?

940
00:22:17,348 --> 00:22:18,181
- Why?

941
00:22:18,181 --> 00:22:20,235
- Cos when I walked in it looked like you messed up

942
00:22:20,235 --> 00:22:21,563
your make-up on accident.

943
00:22:21,563 --> 00:22:22,430
- Yeah.

944
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:24,203
- But now it looks like you messed up your make-up

945
00:22:24,203 --> 00:22:25,036
on purpose.

946
00:22:25,036 --> 00:22:26,320
(laughter)

947
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,530
- I have a very quick question for you by the way.

948
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:28,363
- Yeah.

949
00:22:28,363 --> 00:22:29,430
- How's the Adsense?

950
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:30,263
- Brutal.

951
00:22:30,263 --> 00:22:31,096
- Brutal.

952
00:22:31,096 --> 00:22:31,929
- I mean brutal.

953
00:22:31,929 --> 00:22:33,000
- I love how the first time I met you by the way

954
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,068
at Zane's birthday party you asked me what does your

955
00:22:34,068 --> 00:22:35,028
Adsense look like?

956
00:22:35,028 --> 00:22:35,861
- Dude, because.

957
00:22:35,861 --> 00:22:37,120
- And then you saw it.

958
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,379
- Yeah, I saw your Adsense.

959
00:22:38,379 --> 00:22:39,212
- I wanna see yours!

960
00:22:39,212 --> 00:22:41,060
- I went home and started crying.

961
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,315
I'm gonna show you right now.

962
00:22:42,315 --> 00:22:43,867
James Charles reacts to how much money I make.

963
00:22:43,867 --> 00:22:44,700
(alarm)

964
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,988
- Oh god. Perfect way to end your segment.

965
00:22:46,988 --> 00:22:48,942
- Here you go.

966
00:22:48,942 --> 00:22:51,379
(gasps)

967
00:22:51,379 --> 00:22:53,041
Yeh, it's not good.

968
00:22:53,041 --> 00:22:55,401
- Why is it that low?

969
00:22:55,401 --> 00:22:57,217
- I don't know, can I have a job?

970
00:22:57,217 --> 00:22:58,610
(laughter)

971
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:00,557
- We are Sisters sister LLC

972
00:23:00,557 --> 00:23:02,093
- Guys, go buy the merch.

973
00:23:02,093 --> 00:23:05,133
Maybe James will give me a percentage of the proceeds.

974
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:06,710
- Definitely not.

975
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:08,440
Well hopefully the person after you will come and

976
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,320
kill it too.

977
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,153
- I hope so too.

978
00:23:10,153 --> 00:23:12,720
- David, thank you so much for taking part in this process

979
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,553
today.

980
00:23:13,553 --> 00:23:14,386
- Thank you for having me.

981
00:23:14,386 --> 00:23:15,237
- All jokes aside, I really enjoy your videos and you're

982
00:23:15,237 --> 00:23:17,445
one of my favorite creators to watch on this platform.

983
00:23:17,445 --> 00:23:18,278
- Thanks.

984
00:23:18,278 --> 00:23:20,000
- And thank you for creating such entertaining four minute

985
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,030
and twenty second content, three times a week.

986
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,040
- That's really sweet, thank you.

987
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:23,873
- Yeah, I'm being serious.

988
00:23:23,873 --> 00:23:25,380
- See, now I woulda done a better job if I knew you

989
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,909
were gonna gas me up like this at the end.

990
00:23:26,909 --> 00:23:29,275
(laughter)

991
00:23:29,275 --> 00:23:30,890
- Okay, I'm gonna bring in the next person.

992
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:31,723
- Okay great.

993
00:23:31,723 --> 00:23:32,556
- Thank you James.

994
00:23:32,556 --> 00:23:34,600
- I love when your first sentence is oh no,

995
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,910
this is bad.

996
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:37,653
- It's really bad.

997
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,193
I don't even know how to fix it.

998
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:42,290
- Everybody please welcome Corinna.

999
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:43,123
- Hello.

1000
00:23:43,123 --> 00:23:44,470
- Are you ready for this glam today?

1001
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:46,415
- I don't know where to go.

1002
00:23:46,415 --> 00:23:47,248
- Okay.

1003
00:23:47,248 --> 00:23:49,190
- I feel like I should try and fix the,

1004
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:50,790
who did the eyeshadow?

1005
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:51,623
Okay.

1006
00:23:51,623 --> 00:23:52,456
- There's a lot going on here.

1007
00:23:52,456 --> 00:23:54,060
- Can I take make-up off?

1008
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,005
- Yeah, we have make-up wipes if you really want to.

1009
00:23:56,005 --> 00:23:56,838
- Wait, really?

1010
00:23:56,838 --> 00:23:57,671
- Yeah, I mean yeah.

1011
00:23:57,671 --> 00:23:59,460
You're actually gonna, okay ready?

1012
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,430
- I don't know I feel like this is whatever.

1013
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:02,263
You look like you have pink eye.

1014
00:24:02,263 --> 00:24:03,640
- Okay.

1015
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,473
- Right?

1016
00:24:04,473 --> 00:24:05,306
I mean.

1017
00:24:05,306 --> 00:24:06,139
- Well I feel if anybody is gonna be able to make

1018
00:24:06,139 --> 00:24:07,610
this look OK it's you.

1019
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:09,250
- Well my biggest thing was I felt like I could do

1020
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,952
everything except for eyeshadow.

1021
00:24:10,952 --> 00:24:11,785
- Okay.

1022
00:24:11,785 --> 00:24:13,280
- But now I'm coming in here feeling like I have to help

1023
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,983
the eyeshadow but I don't do eyeshadow.

1024
00:24:14,983 --> 00:24:15,816
- Okay.

1025
00:24:15,816 --> 00:24:16,649
- I'm gonna wing it.

1026
00:24:16,649 --> 00:24:17,482
- You're gonna have, okay great.

1027
00:24:17,482 --> 00:24:18,510
Just like Jonah did.

1028
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:19,352
- Oh so he did?

1029
00:24:19,352 --> 00:24:21,120
He's the weakest link!

1030
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,910
He's literally horrible.

1031
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:24,260
- Okay, Corrina you're gonna have five minutes

1032
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,240
on the clock get as much done as you possibly can.

1033
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,940
Are you ready for this make-up relay race?

1034
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:28,773
- No.

1035
00:24:28,773 --> 00:24:29,959
This is bad, I'm sorry.

1036
00:24:29,959 --> 00:24:30,792
- Three.

1037
00:24:30,792 --> 00:24:31,840
- You look the worst.

1038
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,727
- Go sister.

1039
00:24:32,727 --> 00:24:33,959
- Okay, I'm hoping this doesn't stain.

1040
00:24:33,959 --> 00:24:35,487
(laughter)

1041
00:24:35,487 --> 00:24:37,050
I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding.

1042
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:37,883
- I have a real question for you.

1043
00:24:37,883 --> 00:24:39,015
- Okay.

1044
00:24:39,015 --> 00:24:40,520
- So, one of the kind of running jokes in the Vlog Squad

1045
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,450
is that you hook up with boys.

1046
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:43,283
- Okay.

1047
00:24:43,283 --> 00:24:44,116
- How many of the Vlog Squad members have you hooked

1048
00:24:44,116 --> 00:24:45,090
up with?

1049
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:46,810
- But like hooked up as in?

1050
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:47,760
- At least like made out.

1051
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,862
- Okay so, one, two,

1052
00:24:49,862 --> 00:24:52,300
three, four.

1053
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,350
Four, I think?

1054
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,262
It could be more.

1055
00:24:55,262 --> 00:24:56,095
- Okay.

1056
00:24:56,095 --> 00:24:56,928
- I'm trying to think.

1057
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:57,761
I'm so sorry.

1058
00:24:57,761 --> 00:24:58,594
- It's okay.

1059
00:24:58,594 --> 00:24:59,427
- I'm looking at you and like this is the worst.

1060
00:24:59,427 --> 00:25:00,260
There's like, someone that I'd ship you with.

1061
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,213
- Okay, who, who?

1062
00:25:01,213 --> 00:25:02,285
- I'd ship you with Jeff so hard.

1063
00:25:02,285 --> 00:25:03,213
- Okay.

1064
00:25:03,213 --> 00:25:04,126
- But I don't know,

1065
00:25:04,126 --> 00:25:05,845
wait, can I use this beauty blender?

1066
00:25:05,845 --> 00:25:06,678
- Yeah.

1067
00:25:06,678 --> 00:25:07,981
- I feel like I made this look even worse.

1068
00:25:07,981 --> 00:25:08,814
- Oh god, okay.

1069
00:25:08,814 --> 00:25:09,830
- Oh no.

1070
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:11,250
- Okay, question two because obviously people do make

1071
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:13,190
the jokes about you hooking up guys a lot too and

1072
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:14,294
obviously I just made a joke, but

1073
00:25:14,294 --> 00:25:16,870
I don't know if anybody even remembers but we used to be

1074
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:17,703
really, really close friends and we hung out for a long

1075
00:25:17,703 --> 00:25:19,720
period of time. - We did!

1076
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,700
- Obviously me and your friends make those type of jokes

1077
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:24,610
all the time, but is there a limit to what type of jokes

1078
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:27,040
you let people make in the vlogs?

1079
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,060
Like, is there even a limit?

1080
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,840
- I don't really care that much because like I know

1081
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,647
who I am and I know that,

1082
00:25:31,647 --> 00:25:32,930
they're not true.

1083
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:34,550
They were probably true at one point.

1084
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:35,383
(laughter)

1085
00:25:35,383 --> 00:25:37,680
I'm not gonna say there's also stuff like he's been like

1086
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,260
please let me put it in, and then like paid me

1087
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,123
to put it in.

1088
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:45,999
What's the most amount of money David has paid you to

1089
00:25:45,999 --> 00:25:47,750
put something in the vlog?

1090
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:48,660
You have to tell me that.

1091
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,690
- I don't remember, probably like a thousand

1092
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:51,832
or two thousand dollars.

1093
00:25:51,832 --> 00:25:54,230
This was like, this was like when I needed money and

1094
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:55,130
I wasn't making money.

1095
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:55,963
- Okay, no I love that though.

1096
00:25:55,963 --> 00:25:57,018
- Now I'm not.

1097
00:25:57,018 --> 00:25:57,851
- You gotta do what you gotta do.

1098
00:25:57,851 --> 00:26:00,090
- Now I'm gonna unleash my inner artist.

1099
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:01,020
- Okay, please do.

1100
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,420
- I actually bought this palette.

1101
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,253
You know that right?

1102
00:26:03,253 --> 00:26:04,086
- Did you?

1103
00:26:04,086 --> 00:26:04,919
- Yeah.

1104
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:05,752
- Did you use code James for 10% off your purchase?

1105
00:26:05,752 --> 00:26:06,871
- That's a thing?

1106
00:26:06,871 --> 00:26:08,290
- Yeah.

1107
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:09,123
- Oh no.

1108
00:26:09,123 --> 00:26:10,467
- Wow.

1109
00:26:10,467 --> 00:26:11,300
- I'm so fake.

1110
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,520
- That was good timing, I can't believe you were that fake.

1111
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,615
- Yeah, I'm kinda fake.

1112
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:14,448
- This collab needs to be over right now.

1113
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:15,495
- I'm sorry, wait I didn't know that!

1114
00:26:15,495 --> 00:26:17,495
Well, I mean I just gave you extra money.

1115
00:26:17,495 --> 00:26:18,607
- Yeah, thanks girl.

1116
00:26:18,607 --> 00:26:21,175
- I did not even contribute other than like fixing

1117
00:26:21,175 --> 00:26:22,800
other people's mistakes.

1118
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,633
- You always contribute.

1119
00:26:23,633 --> 00:26:24,568
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1120
00:26:24,568 --> 00:26:25,401
- It's okay.

1121
00:26:25,401 --> 00:26:26,234
- At least I took the bottom off.

1122
00:26:26,234 --> 00:26:27,067
- Hey, it's a team effort at the end.

1123
00:26:27,067 --> 00:26:27,900
- Yeah.

1124
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:28,890
- The end product is all that matters it's not

1125
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:31,170
what's in between so you gotta hope that it looks good.

1126
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:33,240

1127
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,110

- I'll see you in a little bit for the reveal.

1135
00:26:42,865 --> 00:26:44,600
- I'll use code James for 10% off.

1136
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,680
- That's right you probably should.

1137
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,853
Hello.

1138
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:50,420
Come in.

1139
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,433
Hey sister.

1140
00:26:51,433 --> 00:26:52,516
- Oh my gosh.

1141
00:26:54,049 --> 00:26:54,969
- Hey girl.

1142
00:26:54,969 --> 00:26:56,169
- Who did this to your face?

1143
00:26:56,169 --> 00:26:57,650
- Great question.

1144
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:58,483
- Oh no.

1145
00:26:58,483 --> 00:26:59,980
- What do we think so far?

1146
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:02,543
- It could be worse, you've looked better.

1147
00:27:04,138 --> 00:27:06,720
- Okay, welcome to the make-up relay race.

1148
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,040
- I'm so excited to be here.

1149
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,840
It looks like a two year old took a crayon and

1150
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,888
colored your eyes.

1151
00:27:11,888 --> 00:27:12,940
- That'll be David.

1152
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:15,600
- Your eyebrows are definitely done and you have

1153
00:27:16,495 --> 00:27:17,855
all that other stuff on your face and your lip.

1154
00:27:17,855 --> 00:27:19,050
- Okay, you're gonna have five minutes on the clock.

1155
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:19,883
- Okay.

1156
00:27:19,883 --> 00:27:21,010
- Do you know what you're wanna gonna do?

1157
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:23,280
- I guess I'm trying to fix your lips.

1158
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,113
- Okay, cool.

1159
00:27:24,113 --> 00:27:25,350
- Maybe.

1160
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,183
Fix you're eyes a little bit?

1161
00:27:26,183 --> 00:27:27,999
I don't know if I can.

1162
00:27:27,999 --> 00:27:28,832
- Okay.

1163
00:27:28,832 --> 00:27:29,665
- And then maybe some more highlight.

1164
00:27:29,665 --> 00:27:30,498
- Okay.

1165
00:27:30,498 --> 00:27:31,331
- To really pop, I love highlight.

1166

00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:49,730
- Close your eyes.

1178
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:51,000
- Okay, my eyes are closed.

1179
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,460
Well speaking of sister Erin,

1180
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,630
I have a good question for you.

1181
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,463
- Sure.

1182
00:27:54,463 --> 00:27:55,630
- How was the Superbowl a few weeks ago?

1183
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:57,590
- Oh my god it was so fun.

1184
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:58,850
It was the best.

1185
00:27:58,850 --> 00:27:59,890
David just like,

1186
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:01,340
I'm gonna like cry, no.

1187
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,970
But it's just so crazy like,

1188
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:04,470
it's not that I don't feel deserving of it

1189
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:05,460
but it's just like why?

1190
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,070
And I know that I even said it to him like I

1191
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,400
wrote him a thank you note like,

1192
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,620
I know that for you it's just content but like,

1193
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,840
that's life changing stuff like,

1194
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,414
I would never go to the Superbowl if that weren't for him.

1195
00:28:14,414 --> 00:28:15,247
- Yeah.

1196
00:28:15,247 --> 00:28:16,520
- It's really crazy.

1197
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,246
- That's so cool like, you guys are always doing like

1198
00:28:18,246 --> 00:28:19,450
awesome stuff like that.

1199
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:20,283
- Yeah.

1200
00:28:20,283 --> 00:28:21,406
- What has been the best gift that's ever been given

1201
00:28:21,406 --> 00:28:22,695
for a video?

1202
00:28:22,695 --> 00:28:24,070
- Ever?

1203
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:24,903
- Yeah.

1204
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:25,736
In your opinion.

1205
00:28:25,736 --> 00:28:26,700
- Well David's given me three.

1206
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,847
So I may be a little bias.

1207
00:28:27,847 --> 00:28:28,680
- Okay, love that.

1208
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,454
- He got me a car.

1209
00:28:30,454 --> 00:28:31,410
- Oh.

1210
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,422
- Which was great for me.

1211
00:28:33,422 --> 00:28:35,930
I don't know, I always cry at all of them,

1212
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:37,679
for anybody no matter what it is.

1213
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:38,512
- Okay.

1214
00:28:38,512 --> 00:28:40,880
- I just love surprises in general, like for other

1215
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,530
people and like coming home videos.

1216
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:44,790
They all just make me sob.

1217
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:45,623
- Yeah.

1218
00:28:45,623 --> 00:28:47,900
- So, especially seeing someone like David who's

1219
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,215
like so crazy and wild,

1220
00:28:50,215 --> 00:28:52,439
just be generous is so nice.

1221
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:53,272
- Yeah.

1222
00:28:53,272 --> 00:28:54,542
- Little ambidextrous action.

1223
00:28:54,542 --> 00:28:55,870
- Are you really ambidextrous?

1224
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:56,703
- No.

1225
00:28:56,703 --> 00:28:58,000
(laughter)

1226
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,280
I just didn't feel like using my other hand.

1227
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,830
- Okay so what was your first impression of me?

1228
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:03,180
- Today?

1229
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,180
- Well, I guess.

1230
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,050
- Or in general?

1231
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:06,420
- Cos I always see you and Carly tweeting me.

1232
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,253
- Oh my god we love you.

1233

1235
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:11,870
- That was so fast.

1236
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:13,767
- Guess I gotta go.

1237
00:29:13,767 --> 00:29:14,814
Carly and I like,

1238
00:29:14,814 --> 00:29:19,520
we don't like know much about make-up at all.

1239
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,940
Like we use drug store make-up.

1240
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:21,773
- Yeah.

1241
00:29:21,773 --> 00:29:23,840

00:29:30,938 --> 00:29:32,463
- The, the shadow palette?

1247
00:29:32,463 --> 00:29:33,593
- Yeah, it's so pretty.

1248
00:29:33,593 --> 00:29:35,009
- Thank you.

1249
00:29:35,009 --> 00:29:36,097

1250
00:29:36,097 --> 00:29:36,930

Well sister, our time is up we're already..

1257
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:52,040
- Well, well, you look great.

1258
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:52,873
- Do I?

1259
00:29:52,873 --> 00:29:54,908
- You look like a Victoria Secret angel.

1260
00:29:54,908 --> 00:29:55,746
- Wow.

1261
00:29:55,746 --> 00:29:57,240
You're the best.

00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:07,010
be staring at the screen the whole time.

1268
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:08,030
- You have the one pimple?

1269
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:09,080
- Yeah, can you get that for me please?

1270

- Yeah, of course.

1271
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,340
- Can you do it with one of those spongey things?

1272
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,435
I love them I just wanna squeeze them.

1273
00:30:13,435 --> 00:30:14,268
- Okay.

1274
00:30:14,268 --> 00:30:15,196
- Can I squeeze it.

1275
00:30:15,196 --> 00:30:16,420
- You can squeeze whatever you want.

1276
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:18,040
- Oh my god, it's gone.

1277
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,680
- You probably need some areas so I can do that every day.

1278
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,513
How tall are you?

1279
00:30:20,513 --> 00:30:22,580
- I'm like six one,

1280
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,714
six two maybe?

1281
00:30:23,714 --> 00:30:25,200
- Okay cool.

1282
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,460
- How should I fix this?

1283
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,420
I have no idea what I'm doing.

1284
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,570
- Yeah, so you're last,

1285
00:30:29,739 --> 00:30:30,572
so getting ready for our date.

1286
00:30:30,572 --> 00:30:31,596
- I'm here to clean up this mess.

1287
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:32,540
- You're going to clean everything up.

1288
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,820
- Okay, so all I know is that they finish you with

1289
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:35,653
a little spray.

1290
00:30:35,653 --> 00:30:36,486
- Okay.

1291
00:30:36,486 --> 00:30:37,319
- Is that right?

1292
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:38,152
- Yeah.

1293
00:30:38,152 --> 00:30:38,985
You're gonna have a good five minutes on the clock.

1294
00:30:38,985 --> 00:30:39,818
- Okay.

1295
00:30:39,818 --> 00:30:40,670
- So make any changes that you like, to really

1296
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:41,820
pull the look together.

1297
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:42,683
- Okay.

1298
00:30:42,683 --> 00:30:43,531
- And to add that signature Jeff touch.

1299
00:30:43,531 --> 00:30:44,420
- Okay.

1300
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:46,555
- And then you'll, we'll do the final reveal.

1301
00:30:46,555 --> 00:30:48,300
- This is the mic that you guys use?

1302
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,931
You don't have like lab mics on?

1303
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,110
Are you wearing a lab mic under you?

1304
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:52,027
- Do you wanna check?

1305
00:30:52,027 --> 00:30:52,860
- No?

1306
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:53,693
- Can I check under you?

1307
00:30:53,693 --> 00:30:55,210
- Yeah, you can check under there.

1308
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:56,650
I got nothing.

1309
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:57,722
Okay, okay.

1310
00:30:57,722 --> 00:30:58,650
(laughter)

1311
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:00,515
This is one of those videos huh?

1312
00:31:00,515 --> 00:31:01,620
Alright, alright.

1313
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:02,453
- You ready?

1314
00:31:02,453 --> 00:31:03,286
- Yeah, let's do it.

1315
00:31:03,286 --> 00:31:04,923
- Okay, ready? 3,2,1 go.

1316
00:31:04,923 --> 00:31:06,651
- Aren't you gonna coach me through it.

1317
00:31:06,651 --> 00:31:07,833
- No, you have to do whatever your heart desires.

1318
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:09,490
- Where's the spray?

1319
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:10,590
Let's do a little bit of this.

1320
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,723
- Okay.

1321
00:31:11,723 --> 00:31:12,556
- I've always wanted to do this,

1322
00:31:12,556 --> 00:31:13,389
a little bit blending.

1323
00:31:13,389 --> 00:31:14,715
- Yeah, I love a good...

1324
00:31:14,715 --> 00:31:15,548
- This is a blender ball?

1325
00:31:15,548 --> 00:31:16,381
- Yes, please.

1326
00:31:16,381 --> 00:31:17,214
So Jeff, you're pretty much the newest member of

1327
00:31:17,214 --> 00:31:18,150
the Vlog Squad.

1328
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:19,883
- I guess, kinda like, I didn't sign any contracts

1329
00:31:19,883 --> 00:31:21,259
or anything.

1330
00:31:21,259 --> 00:31:22,840
- Do you like it so far?

1331
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,760
Tell me the vibe, what do you feel?

1332
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,593
- Yeah, they're great.

1333
00:31:24,593 --> 00:31:25,426
They're all great guys.

1334
00:31:25,426 --> 00:31:26,635
You got a little crew yourself here.

1335
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:27,680
- I do.

1336
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,200
- They're all beautiful by the way.

1337
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,030
I was looking at that picture of you guys outside.

1338
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:31,863
- The family photo.

1339
00:31:31,863 --> 00:31:33,355
- What a better looking crew than we have.

1340
00:31:33,355 --> 00:31:35,150
We gotta pretty good squad.

1341
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:36,643
- We should probably marry and retake the photo.

1342
00:31:36,643 --> 00:31:39,300
- Can I be in that photo?

1343
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,133
- 100%

1344
00:31:40,133 --> 00:31:41,066
- Oh my god,

1345
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:43,099
I'm telling David I'm done right now.

1346
00:31:43,099 --> 00:31:43,932
- Great!

1347
00:31:43,932 --> 00:31:45,410
- I'm going downstairs and saying David we're finished.

1348
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:46,346
Do you shoot people with paintball guns?

1349
00:31:46,346 --> 00:31:47,790
- No.

1350
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:48,623
- That's great.

1351
00:31:48,623 --> 00:31:51,030
- So Jeff, you're from Staten Island right?

1352
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:52,051
Did you know that I grew up in New York too?

1353
00:31:52,051 --> 00:31:52,906
- Did you?

1354
00:31:52,906 --> 00:31:53,810
Where?

1355
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:54,643
- Upstate.

1356
00:31:54,643 --> 00:31:55,476
- Really?

1357
00:31:55,476 --> 00:31:56,790
- Right outside of Albany but I went to visit the city

1358
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:57,623
all the time.

1359
00:31:57,623 --> 00:31:58,700
- What nationality are you?

1360
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,580
- Caucasian.

1361
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:00,630
- Yeah, very.

1362
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:02,267
- You look so exotic.

1363
00:32:02,267 --> 00:32:03,590
- Okay, thanks.

1364
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:04,820
Is that a good thing?

1365
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:05,653
- Yeah.

1366
00:32:05,653 --> 00:32:06,486
- Okay.

1367
00:32:06,486 --> 00:32:07,650
- You got the face of like, a supermodel.

1368
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:09,714
And the body of like a triathlete.

1369
00:32:09,714 --> 00:32:10,967
- Oh okay.

1370
00:32:10,967 --> 00:32:12,680
- You do some swimming,

1371
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,930
and some running.

1372
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:15,500
And a little bit of weights, just a little bit

1373
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,760
just to keep a little bit of muscle.

1374
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,593
- Okay.

1375
00:32:17,593 --> 00:32:18,460
- Yeah.

1376
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,293
- Okay.

1377
00:32:19,293 --> 00:32:20,126
- Is that good do you like that?

1378
00:32:20,126 --> 00:32:20,959
- Yeah I love that.

1379
00:32:20,959 --> 00:32:22,200
When you were living in New York where you working

1380
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,090
there as a barber too?

1381
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:25,610
- I was a barber there up until 18,

1382
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,490
then I moved to South Beach, Miami.

1383
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:29,680
I lived there for two years, I don't remember

1384
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,907
any of it but I..

1385
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:32,394
- You know what I remember when you was living in Miami?

1386
00:32:32,394 --> 00:32:34,466
That you were a member of the Bad Girls' Club.

1387
00:32:34,466 --> 00:32:35,549
- No, no, no.

1388
00:32:36,573 --> 00:32:38,687
Come on, whatever.

1389
00:32:38,687 --> 00:32:42,310
Alright, I made some stupid choices to do TV shows

1390
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,689
and I'm not exactly proud of.

1391
00:32:43,689 --> 00:32:45,420
Let's put this spray on there.

1392
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,253
- Yeah.

1393
00:32:46,253 --> 00:32:47,930
So now you've moved to LA and do you have your own

1394
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:50,185
barbershop or do you work in one?

1395
00:32:50,185 --> 00:32:51,018
- Let me get a little closer here.

1396
00:32:51,018 --> 00:32:51,851
- Oh please do.

1397
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,335
- I have a barbershop in my house, that you're

1398
00:32:55,335 --> 00:32:56,547
gonna come to right?

1399
00:32:56,547 --> 00:32:57,380
- Oh definitely.

1400
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:59,060
- Yeah, do you trust me to cut your hair?

1401
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,140
- I don't know.

1402
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:02,080
- It's not like make-up you can't just was it off.

1403
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,000
- That's true.

1404
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,699
I'd trust you with anything at this point.

1405
00:33:04,699 --> 00:33:05,532
- Anything huh?

1406
00:33:05,532 --> 00:33:07,200
- Yeah

1407
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,220
- Do you wanna just, do you have any like oils?

1408
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,083
Maybe we could do like a full body massage here.

1409
00:33:11,083 --> 00:33:13,531
- No but we can definitely find one.

1410
00:33:13,531 --> 00:33:15,870
- Okay, we'll save that for the end.

1411
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:16,703
- Okay, great.

1412
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,750
- After the video ends when we cut.

1413
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,051
So we'll put this on and then that's it right?

1414
00:33:20,051 --> 00:33:20,884
- Yeah.

1415
00:33:20,884 --> 00:33:21,717
- The make-ups done.

1416
00:33:21,717 --> 00:33:22,550
- I guess so.

1417
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:24,035
- You look like you're going out to the Grammy's.

1418
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:26,520
Are you going to the Grammy's?

1419
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,353
- No.

1420
00:33:27,353 --> 00:33:28,243
- You would be doing something its,

1421
00:33:28,243 --> 00:33:31,120
like a crazy event after you've filmed this video.

1422
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,619
- I, with this make-up on?

1423
00:33:32,619 --> 00:33:33,452
- Yeah.

1424
00:33:33,452 --> 00:33:35,253
- Do you wanna be my plus one, my date on the red carpet?

1425
00:33:35,253 --> 00:33:36,530
- I would love to.

1426
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:37,557
- Wow, that's really cute.

1427
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:38,520
- I've never been to the Grammy's.

1428
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,353
- Me either.

1429
00:33:39,353 --> 00:33:40,227
Who's your favorite person that you've gotten to

1430
00:33:40,227 --> 00:33:41,800
cut so far?

1431
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,219
- Oh that smells nice, can I have some too?

1432
00:33:43,219 --> 00:33:44,052
- Sure.

1433
00:33:44,052 --> 00:33:46,019
- Oh wow, that's so refreshing.

1434
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:46,950
- Yeah.

1435
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:48,652
- So my favorite person I've got to cut so far

1436
00:33:48,652 --> 00:33:50,200
that's a good question.

1437
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,820
I actually gave a homeless guy a haircut and it

1438
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:54,437
was awesome to see how happy he was after.

1439
00:33:54,437 --> 00:33:55,270
- Aw.

1440
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:56,930
- But also you know, I'll drop a few names since

1441
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:57,763
I'm here.

1442
00:33:57,763 --> 00:33:59,451
I did give Amber Rose her shaved head.

1443
00:33:59,451 --> 00:34:00,500
- You did?

1444
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,467
- Yeah, she's so sweet, she's the nicest person.

1445
00:34:02,467 --> 00:34:03,300
- Yeah.

1446
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,170
- Then next up there's you, that's all I care about.

1447
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:06,250
After that I'm retiring.

1448
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:07,483
I'm giving my clippers away,

1449
00:34:07,483 --> 00:34:09,180
that's it I'm wrapping up the show.

1450
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,164
- Okay, I love that.

1451
00:34:10,164 --> 00:34:10,997
(alarm)

1452
00:34:10,997 --> 00:34:11,830
- Yeah, that's it, we're done.

1453
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:12,720
You look great.

1454
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,553
- Thanks Jeff.

1455
00:34:13,553 --> 00:34:14,740
- I hope I didn't mess up too much.

1456
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:16,490
- That's okay, you could have done anything

1457
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:17,323
and I would have been happy with it.

1458
00:34:17,323 --> 00:34:18,320
- Are we done?

1459
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,787
So can we cut and do the massage?

1460
00:34:19,787 --> 00:34:23,060
- We can cut and do whatever your heart desires.

1461
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,275
- Yeah, what do you say we get out of here and we

1462
00:34:24,275 --> 00:34:25,360
can talk about that massage a little more?

1463
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,707
- We can get out of here and talk about

1464
00:34:26,707 --> 00:34:27,540
whatever you want.

1465
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,373
- Let's go, hop up here.

1466
00:34:28,373 --> 00:34:29,380
- I'm so ready for this!

1467
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:31,176
- You must weigh about 80 pounds.

1468
00:34:31,176 --> 00:34:32,495
- Wow Jeff we're going to get married.

1469
00:34:32,495 --> 00:34:34,095
- Okay are you guys ready to see?

1470
00:34:34,095 --> 00:34:34,928
- [Crowd] Yes.

1471
00:34:34,928 --> 00:34:36,208
- That you all did as a group?

1472
00:34:36,208 --> 00:34:37,090
- [Crowd] Yes.

1473
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:39,870
- 3, 2, 1

1474
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:40,703
- [Crowd] Oh!

1475
00:34:41,759 --> 00:34:44,117
- You look so different!

1476
00:34:44,117 --> 00:34:45,243
- It's okay.

1477
00:34:45,243 --> 00:34:48,903
- It's definitely not that bad at all.

1478
00:34:48,903 --> 00:34:50,584
- It looks like you got,

1479
00:34:50,584 --> 00:34:52,710
it looks like you got bad lip injections.

1480
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:54,823
- You look like you're 20 years older.

1481
00:34:56,429 --> 00:35:00,890
- I'm just, it's weird seeing what it went to after me.

1482
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,350
- That eyeshadow looks a lot better than when I saw.

1483
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:04,183
- Okay.

1484
00:35:04,183 --> 00:35:06,370
- Can I say, can I say something?

1485
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:08,710
After I did the coloring to your eyes,

1486
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:10,430
a lot of people came down and was like,

1487
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:11,490
someone really fucked it up!

1488
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:13,810
(laughter)

1489
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:14,866
I guess it was me?

1490
00:35:14,866 --> 00:35:17,700
But now what they did with it, it looks really good.

1491
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,533
- Oh yes, professional.

1492
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,090
- It's like lighter, I love it.

1493
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:21,300
Who did the worst?

1494
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,280
- Do you actually want me to tell you?

1495
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,113
- Yeah.

1496
00:35:23,113 --> 00:35:24,676
Don't get offended.

1497
00:35:25,533 --> 00:35:27,050
Who was the weakest link?

1498
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:28,010
- [Crowd] Jonah!

1499
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:30,074
(laughter)

1500
00:35:30,074 --> 00:35:31,202
- Who was the best?

1501
00:35:31,202 --> 00:35:32,763
- James is like the best kisser, that's Jeff.

1502
00:35:34,067 --> 00:35:35,817
- Is that why the lipstick's messy?

1503
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:39,580
- Okay, so I was really impressed with Heath, Zane and Matt

1504
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,706
all knew what exactly what to do.

1505
00:35:40,706 --> 00:35:42,789
(cheers)

1506
00:35:44,012 --> 00:35:46,370
They all knew exactly what they needed to do,

1507
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:48,564
like Heath was I'm gonna do primer, then foundation

1508
00:35:48,564 --> 00:35:50,564
- Looks like there's a new Sister Squad.

1509
00:35:51,611 --> 00:35:53,330
- I was actually really thoroughly impressed,

1510
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:54,890
I mean obviously Zane and Matt had a little bit

1511
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:57,070
of an advantage because we had just filmed a video,

1512
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:59,410
but it meant a lot that you were paying attention.

1513
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:01,916
