00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,750
- [Together] Hi sisters!

2
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:03,200
- James Charles here, and welcome back

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,590
to my YouTube channel!

4
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:05,864
As you guys can see, I'm joined today

5
00:00:05,864 --> 00:00:10,070
with a very iconic sister special guest.

6
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,230
- I'm a famous beauty guru.

7
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:13,073
- Jenna Marbles!

8
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,000
You guys, today we are here for an episode of

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,090
James' Ratchet Beauty Salon, and I am

10
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:21,100
so beyond excited, because I have wanted to do

11
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,171
this video together for so long now.

12
00:00:23,171 --> 00:00:24,510
You're one of my favorite YouTubers literally

13
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,260
of all time, and I have so many,

14
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,180
come on!

15
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,250
I literally have been watching you since I was

16
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:31,640
a little kid.

17
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,510
And this means so much, and I'm already so excited

18
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:34,343
for you to be here today.

19
00:00:34,343 --> 00:00:35,613
- [Jenna] I love you.

20
00:00:35,613 --> 00:00:36,610
- I love you more!

21
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:38,240
We have so much that I want to talk to you about today,

22
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,150
and you also,

23
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:40,310
I'm serious here.

24
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,960
On your channel, with Jenna's Ratchet Beauty Salon ...

25
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:43,793
- Yes.

26
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:45,800
- With some pretty good makeup tips.

27
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,633
- Thank you.

28
00:00:46,633 --> 00:00:47,633
- Questionable sometimes. - Thank you.

29
00:00:47,633 --> 00:00:48,901
- But pretty good. - Thank you.

30
00:00:48,901 --> 00:00:50,456
- Yeah.

31
00:00:50,456 --> 00:00:51,668
- Yup. - So I figured ...

32
00:00:51,668 --> 00:00:53,011
- I'm a professional.

33
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:53,950
- You are definitely a professional.

34
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:57,013
We just had our Valentine's Day video-versary.

35
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,330
- Happy video-versary, James.

36
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,660
- Because last year, you did a video following

37
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,410
my Valentine's Day makeup tutorial, which I was so shook by

38
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,170
because I think the first time we met was at Playlist.

39
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,003
- You were ... - It was.

40
00:01:08,003 --> 00:01:10,830
- So tall, so gorgeous, legs for days,

41
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,900
and I was like, oh my god, that's James Charles.

42
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,760
- What? You walked by and you were like, hey James Charles.

43
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,524
And I was like, oh my god that was Jenna Marbles.

44
00:01:17,524 --> 00:01:19,197
I was like walking in and you were walking out,

45
00:01:19,197 --> 00:01:21,550
and it was literally just that, a quick three-second moment,

46
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:22,450
and I was like ...

47
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:24,343
Oh my god.

48
00:01:24,343 --> 00:01:25,300
And then you did the video following my Valentine's Day

49
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,020
makeup tutorial, and I think I was only at like

50
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,074
2 million subscribers at that point, so I was shook.

51
00:01:30,074 --> 00:01:30,907
- I love you.

52
00:01:30,907 --> 00:01:31,740
- But I was so excited and so happy,

53
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,150
because, like I said, I've been watching you forever,

54
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,830
you've inspired me and so many other people,

55
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,041
and I figured for today's video--

56
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:36,940
- I'm gonna cry.

57
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:38,220
- We should get together,

58
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,126
and open James' Ratchet Beauty Salon.

59
00:01:40,126 --> 00:01:40,959
- Yes.

60
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:43,760
- Talk about all things YouTube, the beauty community,

61
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,150
love, I feel like we should definitely talk about

62
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,036
finding me a boyfriend today.

63
00:01:47,036 --> 00:01:48,280
- James! James!

64
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,527
- Because it's been quite the trending topic for you.

65
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,410
- You literally just posted a video that was like

66
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:54,693
I'm gonna be sad and alone forever.

67
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,540
- Yeah. - James.

68
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,860
- Well it's true. I didn't lie.

69
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,700
- Boy, I swear to god.

70
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,310
- I feel like we have so many things to talk about,

71
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,550
should we just jump right in?

72
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,030
- Yeah, let's just jump into it.

73
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,186
- Okay great.

74
00:02:06,186 --> 00:02:08,769
(upbeat music)

75
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,100
We're gonna start off with two different foundations,

76
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,460
and I'm not even sure which one we're gonna do,

77
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,450
I think we're gonna try mixing together

78
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:19,650
Fenty and Too Faced.

79
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,280
We know that it's a trend for me to not be able

80
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,650
to do this very well so,

81
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,490
we're not really expecting much here.

82
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:25,498
But everything else will be good.

83
00:02:25,498 --> 00:02:26,331
- It's okay James.

84
00:02:26,331 --> 00:02:28,940
I never match anything because I'm always different shades

85
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,200
of fake tan, so.

86
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,280
- Same!

87
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,795
I actually just got tanned again for the first time

88
00:02:32,795 --> 00:02:35,280
in a while a few days ago, so I am feeling

89
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,200
my bronze fantasy.

90
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,200
My foundation actually matches pretty good today.

91
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,297
- You look beautiful.

92
00:02:39,297 --> 00:02:41,980
Ten million times even more beautiful in person.

93
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:42,813
- Oh thanks angel.

94
00:02:42,813 --> 00:02:44,710
- You're welcome.

95
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:47,110
- Okay, so I am so excited for today's video

96
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:49,050
because I have wanted to do this forever now.

97
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,300
- Because you just want to do a nice lovely look

98
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,603
on mature skin?

99
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:54,893
- Yes.

100
00:02:54,893 --> 00:02:56,760
You've been on YouTube for a very, very long time now.

101
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,593
- Yeah.

102
00:02:57,593 --> 00:02:59,980
- Like one of the OGs. Day one. How many years has it been?

103
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,550
- I've been making videos on Jenna Marbles for nine years.

104
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,383
Almost ten.

105
00:03:04,383 --> 00:03:05,660
- Oh my god. - Yeah.

106
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,500
- That's so cool.

107
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,450
And you still love it as much as you did before?

108
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,610
- Yeah, I mean it has its ups and downs,

109
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,650
some days it's the best thing in the world,

110
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,420
and some days it's really stressful but yeah I love it.

111
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,570
- How have you been able to stay motivated

112
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:20,300
and inspired to keep making content after ten years?

113
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,517
Because I've only been at this for two and I'm like ...

114
00:03:23,517 --> 00:03:26,270
I constantly am like, oh god what am I gonna do next?

115
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:27,363
- Yeah well.

116
00:03:27,363 --> 00:03:28,830
I feel like that never goes away.

117
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:29,663
- Yeah.

118
00:03:29,663 --> 00:03:32,530
- I just have a schedule, and it forces you to create

119
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:34,840
on a regular basis, whether you like it or not.

120
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,950
It's your job, go do it.

121
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,390
- Yeah. - And have fun.

122
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,360
Do the best you can.

123
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,660
Some days you're gonna kill it, and some days you're not,

124
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,880
so, just be with yourself through the good days

125
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,713
and bad days, you know?

126
00:03:44,713 --> 00:03:45,546
- Right.

127
00:03:45,546 --> 00:03:46,440
How would you say the platform has changed

128
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,683
over the past ten years of being on it?

129
00:03:48,683 --> 00:03:50,040
- Oh so much.

130
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,140
When I started it was weird.

131
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,787
It was just a weird place for people to post whatever.

132
00:03:55,787 --> 00:03:56,620
- Yeah.

133
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,430
- Like on my first channel, I had a bunch of videos

134
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:02,220
like from college that were school projects.

135
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,210
Now you hear kids being like, I wanna grow up

136
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,360
and be a YouTuber.

137
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,660
- Which is so cool. - Yeah.

138
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,576
- But also scary. - Totally.

139
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:10,860
- But it's been really cool to watch the evolution

140
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,500
of Jenna Marbles and see you here still making content

141
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,350
today, and just like ...

142
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:15,183
- Awe, thanks. - Killing it.

143
00:04:15,183 --> 00:04:16,016
It's really cool.

144
00:04:16,016 --> 00:04:19,070
- I have always thought, like this will probably end someday

145
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,561
and that'll be okay, but I still have a job, so.

146
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:22,394
- Right.

147
00:04:22,394 --> 00:04:23,227
- So it's really amazing.

148
00:04:23,227 --> 00:04:25,460
Ten years ago when I started, it was kind of difficult

149
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:28,160
for anybody to write something nice about YouTubers.

150
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,130
- Oh yeah.

151
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,250
- Because it was a joke.

152
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,080
- Well even still, I just got back from London

153
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,710
a few weeks ago when I was traveling there

154
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:35,900
and I got mauled.

155
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,790
- I saw that.

156
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:37,740
- By the British media.

157
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,740
- Although I've heard like from some of the UK YouTubers

158
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,105
they get treated a lot worse over there.

159
00:04:43,105 --> 00:04:43,938
- Yeah.

160
00:04:43,938 --> 00:04:45,597
- But here it's getting better, you know,

161
00:04:45,597 --> 00:04:48,400
if you work with a traditional celebrity

162
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,850
in the past sometimes it might have been like

163
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:54,080
oh a producer has brought you on to be the social media

164
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,790
person but the talent doesn't really know

165
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:57,623
who you are-- - Right.

166
00:04:57,623 --> 00:04:58,456
- Or care. - Or care.

167
00:04:58,456 --> 00:04:59,324
- But they're still nice.

168
00:04:59,324 --> 00:05:00,157
- Right.

169
00:05:00,157 --> 00:05:00,990
- But now it's different.

170
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,880
People know who you are and they value

171
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,650
what you bring to the table.

172
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:05,483
- Which is exciting.

173
00:05:05,483 --> 00:05:06,810
You kind of started on YouTube

174
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:09,670
because a lot of your videos all went viral.

175
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:13,330
Like, really, really insane crazy views

176
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,149
which is super cool to look back at like

177
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:17,099
all the old drunk makeup tutorials, and

178
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,890
literally when you were sitting in your bathroom

179
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,337
and filming on ...

180
00:05:21,337 --> 00:05:22,250
- My laptop.

181
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,083
- I don't even know what, yeah the laptop.

182
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,040
- It was a laptop.

183
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,553
And I would film and edit at the same time.

184
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:28,484
- What?

185
00:05:28,484 --> 00:05:29,317
- Yeah.

186
00:05:29,317 --> 00:05:31,380
I would open up my laptop, and shoot on iMovie,

187
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,960
and edit it as I was filming it.

188
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,793
Yeah.

189
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:36,503
- Why?

190
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:37,650
- I don't know, that's what I did.

191
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:38,913
I didn't have a camera.

192
00:05:38,913 --> 00:05:39,746
- Yeah.

193
00:05:39,746 --> 00:05:40,740
- So I was just filming it with what I had.

194
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,520
Yeah, all of my raw files are me just like ...

195
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,940
Click ...

196
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,200
And then another thing!

197
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,570
Like half the time my arm's coming in and out of frame,

198
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:50,030
because I'm stopping it.

199
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,620
Yeah. I didn't have a camera.

200
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,880
- That's like everything to me, though.

201
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,560
That's so cool to see the evolution.

202
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,993
So what would you say is what the differences is

203
00:05:55,993 --> 00:05:59,030
between going viral then versus now.

204
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:01,890
- I feel like ten years ago, when something went viral

205
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,862
it means that everybody saw it.

206
00:06:03,862 --> 00:06:04,695
- Right.

207
00:06:04,695 --> 00:06:06,410
- Whereas now you could go viral on Facebook,

208
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,020
you could go viral on Instagram,

209
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:11,190
or the word is sort of lost a little bit

210
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:14,150
of what that means, because so many people's attention

211
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,394
is in a million different places.

212
00:06:15,394 --> 00:06:16,510
- Is in a million places, yeah.

213
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:20,970
- So, I feel like things go viral less often,

214
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:22,730
but more often at the same time.

215
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:23,593
- Yeah. That's a good way to put it.

216
00:06:23,593 --> 00:06:25,800
There's so many more people that have access

217
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,633
to everything now.

218
00:06:26,633 --> 00:06:28,760
I've had a few videos now pass like 20 million,

219
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,570
which has been so crazy.

220
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:33,210
And they're always ones that I least expect, too.

221
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:34,190
- That's how the internet works.

222
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,023
- That's how the internet works!

223
00:06:35,023 --> 00:06:38,490
But even then, I'm like, oh well okay 20 million.

224
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:42,133
But it's like 20 million people watched that.

225
00:06:42,133 --> 00:06:44,050
That is insane.

226
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:47,940
- I especially relate to the videos that you feel like

227
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,380
are whatever are the ones that people really like

228
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,860
and respond to, and the ones that you put all your energy

229
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,783
into and you really enjoy, people are like,

230
00:06:54,783 --> 00:06:56,170
hmm, I didn't like this one.

231
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:57,810
Like shit, sorry.

232
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,280
I don't know what you guys want.

233
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,850
- My second most viewed video on my channel is literally

234
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:04,980
my FAKE Palette video where I bought the fake palette

235
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,200
from Santee Alley and reviewed it,

236
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,007
I hated how the video turned out, I was like

237
00:07:09,007 --> 00:07:10,330
this is gonna be a horrible video, I don't even know

238
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,830
if I want to post this, and it's at like 25 million views

239
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,060
now. - Yeah.

240
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,220
That's how it always works.

241
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,260
- I was like, what?

242
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,840
- The green screen video that I filmed

243
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,530
literally after I was done filming it, I laid on the couch

244
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:24,250
like in full green-face and I was like

245
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,860
Julien, I'm not gonna upload it, it's terrible,

246
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,515
I'm just gonna tell people that I ruined my videos.

247
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:30,357
- That's one of my favorite videos from you.

248
00:07:30,357 --> 00:07:32,779
- But I was so defeated by the end of that,

249
00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:34,380
I was like, this was a horrible video.

250
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,240
I hated it.

251
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,130
- Really? - Yeah.

252
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:38,800
- I'm just applying a light coat of powder all over.

253
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,880
- Oh I feel so powdered, I'm baking.

254
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,770
- I wanna use a little bit of a lighter bell

255
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:47,080
because we definitely put on some foundation, duh

256
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,790
and concealer, and I don't want anything to look

257
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:50,030
really cakey.

258
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:50,863
- Cake me.

259
00:07:50,863 --> 00:07:52,040
- What are some of your favorite channels to watch

260
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,294
on YouTube?

261
00:07:53,294 --> 00:07:56,040
- I watch a lot of beauty videos.

262
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,873
- Do you actually?

263
00:07:56,873 --> 00:07:57,706
- I really like them.

264
00:07:57,706 --> 00:07:59,320
- Okay. - I always have.

265
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,700
That's the channels that I first got into,

266
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,356
Juicy Star, oh my god.

267
00:08:04,356 --> 00:08:05,189
- Yes.

268
00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:07,570
- I loved the old school beauty gurus,

269
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,250
and I'd never seen so many people with on-suite bathrooms

270
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:12,750
in their videos in my life, I couldn't believe it.

271
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,890
I was like, oh my god, these people are so rich

272
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:16,740
they have their own bathrooms.

273
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,860
I feel like they've just gotten so much cooler

274
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,210
and better with time

275
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:21,043
- Yeah.

276
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:22,400
- People are just so talented.

277
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,230
Like when I was a little girl I wanted to do makeup.

278
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,140
- Really?

279
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:25,973
- Yeah.

280
00:08:25,973 --> 00:08:27,980
I had all the books, I had Kevin Au-coin

281
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,226
and like the Bobby Brown.

282
00:08:29,226 --> 00:08:30,059
- Who?

283
00:08:30,059 --> 00:08:30,892
- Au-coin? Whatever his name is?

284
00:08:30,892 --> 00:08:31,725
- Kevin Aucoin?

285
00:08:31,725 --> 00:08:32,946
- Whatever. How do I say it?

286
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:33,840
- Kevin Aucoin.

287
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,810
- I loved his book. I loved his book.

288
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:36,960
- Yeah, he's iconic.

289
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,026
You grew up in New York.

290
00:08:39,026 --> 00:08:41,380
I, for some reason thought you grew up in

291
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,590
I knew you lived in Rochester, but I thought

292
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,170
you grew up in New Jersey, but you grew up in

293
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:46,003
New York.

294
00:08:46,003 --> 00:08:46,836
- Rochester New York.

295
00:08:46,836 --> 00:08:48,630
- And I grew up in Albany New York, which is literally

296
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,448
like three-ish hours away from each other?

297
00:08:50,448 --> 00:08:51,281
- Yeah.

298
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:52,243
But that's why I knew that I liked you.

299
00:08:52,243 --> 00:08:53,930
Because you're normal.

300
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,420
Because people from upstate are normal.

301
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,580
- Are normal, yeah.

302
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,413
- Really normal.

303
00:08:57,413 --> 00:08:59,536
- What made you want to move to LA?

304
00:08:59,536 --> 00:09:01,819
- Well I lived in Boston for about 8 years.

305
00:09:01,819 --> 00:09:02,652
- Okay.

306
00:09:02,652 --> 00:09:04,690
- I went to school there.

307
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:06,800
I started doing YouTube after I graduated

308
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,690
from graduate school, and it sort of took off,

309
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:12,580
and I was like, I guess I'll just go down this path

310
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,423
and see where it goes for a little while, and ...

311
00:09:14,423 --> 00:09:15,256
- Yeah.

312
00:09:15,256 --> 00:09:17,310
- Here we are ten years later.

313
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,750
- What has been one of your favorite lessons

314
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,480
that you've learned over the course of the internet?

315
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,080
- I guess just to be nice to everybody.

316
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,720
You know, because you never know what someone else

317
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,940
is going through.

318
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,773
- Yeah.

319
00:09:26,773 --> 00:09:28,989
- I've never watched a video and left a mean comment.

320
00:09:28,989 --> 00:09:30,920
- Ever! Ever!

321
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,753
- Yeah.

322
00:09:31,753 --> 00:09:35,240
And so I just try to remind myself that even if someone

323
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,610
writes something like that, that's not a representation

324
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:38,906
of who they are either.

325
00:09:38,906 --> 00:09:41,523
Because I don't know maybe they're just having

326
00:09:41,523 --> 00:09:43,480
a really bad day and they just want to take it out

327
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,150
on your lash tutorial.

328
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,150
- Right. - You know?

329
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:49,393
Oh my god I look so beautiful already.

330
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:53,010
I feel like the amount of hate that I've gotten too,

331
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,893
if this is any hope for you, does die down.

332
00:09:55,893 --> 00:09:56,726
- Over time?

333
00:09:56,726 --> 00:09:58,650
- Yeah, like I've been on the internet for a long time,

334
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:01,640
so all the people that really wanted to be mean to me

335
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,790
were that a long time ago, and then they gave up

336
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:04,760
and they moved on.

337
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,760
- Yeah.

338
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,530
- I would also say one of the biggest lessons

339
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:10,770
that I learned is being okay with having me time.

340
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:13,870
I mean it, and not like a, I'm gonna cover myself

341
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,743
in paraffin wax kind of way, like ...

342
00:10:15,743 --> 00:10:18,823
You know, have your weekends, and time off,

343
00:10:18,823 --> 00:10:20,240
because it's really good.

344
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,393
It's nothing, but it doesn't serve for nothing.

345
00:10:22,393 --> 00:10:25,020
Because you're so busy, you're gonna get tired.

346
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,387
You're gonna need some me time.

347
00:10:26,387 --> 00:10:27,728
- This brings us into my next point that I wanted

348
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:28,561
to talk to you about.

349
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:31,290
You have been such a cool, like indirect role model

350
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,380
to me I feel like, because in so many videos that you have

351
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,530
mentioned me in, I feel like you're always

352
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:36,520
giving me some sort of advice.

353
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,136
- It is officially February, which means this month

354
00:10:38,136 --> 00:10:40,110
is Valentine's Day.

355
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,840
I'm not excited, it is my least favorite holiday

356
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,940
because I've been single for it for 17 years now,

357
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:44,850
and ...

358
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:45,683
(laughs)

359
00:10:45,683 --> 00:10:46,970
Let's be real, it's gonna be 18 in just a few days.

360
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:47,807
- Oh my god!

361
00:10:48,713 --> 00:10:52,060
It's gonna be okay, alright? You're gonna find your person.

362
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,450
- It's so funny that it's worked out that way,

363
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,360
either whether it be mentioning it in a video

364
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,821
or on Twitter, I feel like it has been really cool

365
00:10:57,821 --> 00:11:00,750
hearing from you as someone who's been in it for a while,

366
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,790
giving your perspective and helping me out,

367
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:05,230
because that is something that I struggle with a lot,

368
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:07,310
is taking time for myself, and forcing myself

369
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:08,880
to take a break, and that is definitely

370
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,510
one of my biggest things that I'm forcing myself to do

371
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:15,160
in 2019, just because 2018 was such an amazing year

372
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,930
for me, and I'm so proud of everything that I achieved,

373
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:19,090
but I was really burnt out.

374
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:20,689
I tried to deal with it publicly too, because I feel like

375
00:11:20,689 --> 00:11:23,592
it's important for everybody else to know that like

376
00:11:23,592 --> 00:11:26,200
this isn't easy all the time, it is really challenging

377
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,650
to come up with new concepts and new ideas.

378
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:32,210
- That is something that I appreciate about what you've done

379
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:36,280
and YouTubers from I guess your generation of YouTubers

380
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,360
have done, is that you've sort of normalized,

381
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,970
I've seen you tweet out like, which thumbnail

382
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:43,560
would you like, or what do you want?

383
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,393
- Yeah.

384
00:11:44,393 --> 00:11:47,450
- Which is something that just wasn't a thing for it,

385
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:48,590
no one cares.

386
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:52,220
No one cares about the meta of brands, or you know.

387
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:55,670
It was just ridiculous for me to ever think about that,

388
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,990
and I also come from a time on the internet where people

389
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:59,478
would be mad at you for taking a brand deal.

390
00:11:59,478 --> 00:12:00,311
- Yeah.

391
00:12:00,311 --> 00:12:01,980
- You were a sellout, how could you?

392
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,270
- Well that happens still a lot

393
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,338
in the beauty community today ...

394
00:12:04,338 --> 00:12:05,440
- Does it really? - But it's better

395
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,190
- At this point, your generation of YouTubers

396
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:11,150
have normalized that, and your audience celebrates it

397
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,770
for you, like when you're doing well, which is rad.

398
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:14,665
- Exciting, yeah.

399
00:12:14,665 --> 00:12:17,100
- I'm so excited to see what you're gonna do with my brows

400
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,300
because I get roasted everyday.

401
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,943
If you can't tell, sometimes I shave off the ends

402
00:12:20,943 --> 00:12:23,070
because I get bored with the tails.

403
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,900
- I love that. Mine are shaved off too.

404
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:25,733
- Really?

405
00:12:25,733 --> 00:12:26,634
- The ends of them - It's fun, right?

406
00:12:26,634 --> 00:12:27,467
- Yeah, it is.

407
00:12:27,467 --> 00:12:28,300
- Everyone thought I was crazy when I did it.

408
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,140
- Okay, so.

409
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,873
Speaking of you giving me advice too.

410
00:12:32,814 --> 00:12:35,540
The one thing that you've harped on me for

411
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:39,920
for a very long time now is my love life.

412
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,440
- James.

413
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,230
You're 19, you're gonna find somebody.

414
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,381
- No.

415
00:12:44,381 --> 00:12:46,750
First of all, how did you guys meet. Tell me the story.

416
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,380
- Julien worked at a bar at the end of my street,

417
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:52,540
and I went in and relentlessly hit on him.

418
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,510
- So was this when you were in Boston?

419
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,343
Or were you in LA at the time?

420
00:12:55,343 --> 00:12:56,370
- I was in LA. - Okay.

421
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:58,963
For me, finding a boyfriend has been challenging.

422
00:12:59,897 --> 00:13:02,260
- James! You're gonna find somebody!

423
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,640
- From watching my channel, and from hearing me talk about

424
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,780
boy stories and stuff, do you have any advice for me

425
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,768
when it comes to finding love?

426
00:13:09,768 --> 00:13:11,700
- Well, so right now I feel like your energy

427
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,128
is a little chaotic.

428
00:13:13,128 --> 00:13:14,210
- A little bit, yeah.

429
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,123
- So I brought you a plant.

430
00:13:16,123 --> 00:13:16,956
- You did?

431
00:13:16,956 --> 00:13:18,260
- I realize you have a couple plants.

432
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,916
- Got me a cute little housewarming gift.

433
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:20,749
- Yeah.

434
00:13:20,749 --> 00:13:22,550
But I feel like when you're looking for love,

435
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,810
the more love you put out into the universe,

436
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:26,780
like if you care for a plant, or like someday

437
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:27,930
you get a doggy or a kitty,

438
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:28,843
I don't know if you like animals.

439
00:13:28,843 --> 00:13:30,220
- I cannot wait, I'm getting a dog soon.

440
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,290
We're adopting.

441
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:33,890
- So if you put love out into the universe,

442
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:36,330
and you focus on yourself, you'll find a love.

443
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:37,610
You'll get that love back.

444
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:40,800
Focus on putting some love out there, and less of the

445
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,770
I'm alone forever energy, and maybe you'll find somebody.

446
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:46,240
- I feel like whenever I do get the busiest

447
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,050
and I'm not thinking about boys, is when I find like

448
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:51,992
three all at once, and then I'm like ...

449
00:13:51,992 --> 00:13:52,825
It's just not fitting well.

450
00:13:52,825 --> 00:13:54,240
- But you're also 19.

451
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,667
Like that would be the same as someone finding

452
00:13:56,667 --> 00:13:58,330
the love of their life in high school.

453
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:00,870
Which happens, but you know, not always.

454
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:03,310
For most people that's not really a thing that happens,

455
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:06,860
so give yourself some time, be patient.

456
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,700
You don't want to be with somebody right now

457
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,040
that's not right for you, your person's gonna come to you

458
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,360
when they're gonna come to you.

459
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,193
- True.

460
00:14:13,193 --> 00:14:15,220
Brows are my favorite part because they can really

461
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:18,070
make or break a makeup routine, but it's so ...

462
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:20,220
- If you don't like them you can just shave them off.

463
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,053
- Okay great.

464
00:14:21,053 --> 00:14:22,115
- I'm dead serious.

465
00:14:22,115 --> 00:14:24,494
(clapping)

466
00:14:24,494 --> 00:14:25,483
I'm so excited!

467
00:14:25,483 --> 00:14:26,720
- Alright you guys, we are back

468
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,760
and both eyebrows are now complete and looking

469
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,910
pretty good and fresh and beautiful and snatched.

470
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:31,743
How do you feel?

471
00:14:31,743 --> 00:14:33,020
- Feels so fresh and beautiful.

472
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,492
- Okay good. So famous.

473
00:14:34,492 --> 00:14:36,010
- So famous. - So famous!

474
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,400
- That's so funny.

475
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,590
- You know what else is really famous?

476
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:40,423
- What?

477
00:14:40,423 --> 00:14:41,256
- Like ...

478
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:42,600
Really famous?

479
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,010
- There she is. I've never seen her in person.

480
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,660
- What? Really?

481
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:49,830
- Tried to order 'em, couldn't order it, you sold out.

482
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:50,970
- I didn't send you one?

483
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:51,803
- No.

484
00:14:53,367 --> 00:14:54,300
- [Julien] Tea.

485
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,133
- Tea!

486
00:14:55,133 --> 00:14:56,910
- Nobody sends me anything.

487
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:57,810
- Do you want one?

488
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:59,580
- I want to buy one with my own money.

489
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,413
- No.

490
00:15:00,413 --> 00:15:01,900
- I want to support you, I don't like, no.

491
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:02,825
- You're the cutest.

492
00:15:02,825 --> 00:15:04,250
Jenna just told me when we walked in that you guys

493
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,720
ordered Sisters apparel, why didn't we just--

494
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,920
- I was trying to get Sisters apparel

495
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,790
for when we filmed together, so we could show up

496
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,110
in our Sisters clothes.

497
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,337
- That is so cute, you guys are the best.

498
00:15:13,337 --> 00:15:14,762
She sold out too.

499
00:15:14,762 --> 00:15:16,633
- Trying to support people, you know?

500
00:15:16,633 --> 00:15:19,310
I don't want you to give me one, I want to buy one.

501
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,950
I'm gonna go to an Ulta and buy it.

502
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:22,956
- Okay, I'll text you when it restocks then.

503
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:23,789
- Thank you.

504
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:25,132
- I'll also give you one, too. For the meantime.

505
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:26,332
- No, no, no no, no, no!

506
00:15:27,403 --> 00:15:29,010
- We have the James Charles X Morphe palette here today,

507
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,803
and we're gonna do a fun and fresh eye look on Jenna.

508
00:15:30,803 --> 00:15:32,310
- Unleash your inner artist!

509
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:33,280
- Yes!

510
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,770
So I wanna do something like, kind of fun,

511
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:38,330
because I feel like when you do do beauty videos,

512
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:39,370
they're not bad.

513
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:40,930
And I think you make fun of yourself all the time

514
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:42,570
for sucking at makeup, but you don't,

515
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:44,740
is the truth tea, sister

516
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,573
- Awe!

517
00:15:45,573 --> 00:15:47,080
- So I feel like we should do something like ...

518
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:47,913
- Whatever you want.

519
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:48,950
- Something fun, right!

520
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,020
- I'm down for whatever.

521
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,299
- Okay. I think I know what look I want to do on you.

522
00:15:52,299 --> 00:15:54,189
- What? Tell us!

523
00:15:54,189 --> 00:15:57,210
- I think I wanna do a purpley-blue on the lid.

524
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:58,043
- Fun.

525
00:15:58,043 --> 00:16:00,173
- With a good sunset ... - Love a sunset.

526
00:16:00,173 --> 00:16:01,550
- Moment. - Love it.

527
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,470
- Yeah. - I'm ready.

528
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:03,750
It'll match my aura.

529
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:04,733
- Yeah.

530
00:16:04,733 --> 00:16:06,250
Like, you have the orange on, and I have the blue and pink,

531
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,580
so like, sunset.

532
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,413
- Perfect.

533
00:16:08,413 --> 00:16:10,010
Oh I know what I wanted to say to you.

534
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:13,240
I think it's so cool that you're sober.

535
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,073
- Oh!

536
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:15,240
- And you don't drink or do any drugs.

537
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,201
- Yeah. A sober sister.

538
00:16:17,201 --> 00:16:18,510
- I think that's really wonderful, James.

539
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,340
- I think it's also because I have a major fear

540
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,980
of getting in trouble.

541
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,378
- Me!

542
00:16:23,378 --> 00:16:25,640
- I always like, going to the principal's office

543
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,250
was my worst nightmare.

544
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,340
- I'm scared of authority.

545
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,860
- Yeah, don't like getting yelled at, don't like

546
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,520
being in trouble, don't like breaking the rules ever.

547
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,813
And obviously when I was in high school, I was very much

548
00:16:34,813 --> 00:16:37,230
underage, and I would hear all the time about people

549
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,773
getting arrested, and people getting stopped by the police

550
00:16:38,773 --> 00:16:41,010
because the police in my town were pretty intense.

551
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:42,510
I would go to school and people would be like

552
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,520
so mad about it, like oh I got busted last night,

553
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,282
and like, hey you're breaking the law.

554
00:16:46,282 --> 00:16:47,115
- Yeah.

555
00:16:47,115 --> 00:16:48,830
- Like, duh, of course you're gonna get in trouble for it.

556
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:51,090
I don't know I just never wanted to do that, and I think

557
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:54,130
also because even before I was doing makeup

558
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:56,780
I was doing hair for girls in my school,

559
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,040
I was trying to do social media.

560
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,050
I was just never interested in doing that,

561
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:01,430
but I think it's because I had so many other things

562
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,263
going on.

563
00:17:02,263 --> 00:17:04,360
- I think it's really admirable, and really cool.

564
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,193
- Thank you. - Yeah.

565
00:17:05,193 --> 00:17:06,257
- I really appreciate that.

566
00:17:06,257 --> 00:17:07,090
- Yeah.

567
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:08,650
Did you ever play any sports, James?

568
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:09,630
- I did actually.

569
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:10,610
- What did you play?

570
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:12,360
- I played baseball.

571
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,440
- Ooh, me too!

572
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,810
- And basketball, and soccer.

573
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:15,643
- Ooh, can't relate to basketball.

574
00:17:15,643 --> 00:17:18,163
- And hockey. - Whoa. A jock.

575
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:22,070
- I was so convinced that I was so straight.

576
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:24,100
I'm not athletic, but I am competitive.

577
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,023
- You're athletic.

578
00:17:25,023 --> 00:17:26,980
- Not really. - Yuh-huh.

579
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,200
I've seen those legs.

580
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,490
- I've always been very, very competitive,

581
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:31,720
so even through sports I didn't really like playing them

582
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,800
but I did like winning.

583
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,670
What did you play?

584
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:36,550
- I played softball all the way through college.

585
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:37,390
- Okay.

586
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,080
I can totally picture that.

587
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:39,913
- Yeah.

588
00:17:39,913 --> 00:17:40,910
- Oh my god, how are your dogs?

589
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,150
- They're so good.

590
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:42,983
- Are they?

591
00:17:42,983 --> 00:17:44,400
- I was gonna ask you if you wanted me to bring any of them

592
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,260
so you could hang.

593
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,093
- Yeah, you should have!

594
00:17:46,093 --> 00:17:47,630
- Damn, I really blew this, didn't I?

595
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:49,260
- [Julien] They would've been crying.

596
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,160
- Oh.

597
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,100
I want to adopt a dog so badly.

598
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,160
- What kind of dog do you want?

599
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,310
Big, little?

600
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,360
- I want a medium sized dog, like not as big

601
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,020
as a lab, just a little bit smaller for sure.

602
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,510
I grew up with a border collie black lab mix,

603
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:02,740
and he was literally ...

604
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:03,573
- Smart.

605
00:18:03,573 --> 00:18:04,777
- The best, and I miss him so much.

606
00:18:04,777 --> 00:18:06,180
- He was a smart boy.

607
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,100
- Yes, he was super, super smart.

608
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,690
I've been really wanting to adopt one, I've just been

609
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:11,977
traveling so much recently that I'm like,

610
00:18:11,977 --> 00:18:14,730
I'm not gonna put a dog through that until I know

611
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,430
that I'm home for a little bit.

612
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,460
Which sucks, but I know is obviously for the better.

613
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:21,070
But my traveling is coming to a half very soon,

614
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,077
so I'm starting to look.

615
00:18:22,077 --> 00:18:24,280
- That's good. You need to look out for yourself.

616
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,113
- Yeah.

617
00:18:25,113 --> 00:18:26,450
I love dogs, and I'm the type of person that likes

618
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:29,360
to be with people at all times, like I love having friends

619
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,193
and family over.

620
00:18:30,193 --> 00:18:31,660
- It's cause you're a Gemini.

621
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,493
- I am.

622
00:18:32,493 --> 00:18:34,750
Why do you say that? Is that a quality that Geminis have?

623
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,720
- I don't know.

624
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,527
- So I like being around people kind of at all times,

625
00:18:37,527 --> 00:18:39,650
and I feel like when I'm not with people, it'd be good

626
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:40,650
for me to have a dog around.

627
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:42,220
Would you get another dog?

628
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,880
- Yeah, we talk about it all the time.

629
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,713
- Really?

630
00:18:44,713 --> 00:18:45,560
- We're gonna rescue a big greyhound.

631
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,830
- So you do want to get another one?

632
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:47,663
- Yeah.

633
00:18:47,663 --> 00:18:50,080
- Okay. And would you want to get a girl or a boy?

634
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,850
- Well, I think we'd get another girl.

635
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:53,620
And so we'd have two boys and two girls.

636
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,520
- Okay.

637
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,620
- And if you ever need a dog-sitter, I'm not kidding,

638
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,550
just drop your dog off at my house.

639
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:59,530
- Really? - [Julien] Yes.

640
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:01,140
- I love watching other people's dogs.

641
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,330
- Okay. Definitely will do.

642
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:05,230
Okay I'm gonna grab a little bit of Artistry

643
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:07,810
from the palette, and I'm gonna put this on your lid,

644
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:08,643
I think.

645
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,472
Let's see how this looks.

646
00:19:13,472 --> 00:19:15,272
Oh wow, look at that!

647
00:19:15,272 --> 00:19:16,799
That color is so famous!

648
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,410
- Oh my god! It's gonna be a whole femur!

649
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:21,670
- I'm gonna add a wing liner.

650
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:22,540
- Ooh!

651
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,170
- I feel like we have to do a wing, it's like staple

652
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:25,003
Jenna Marbles.

653
00:19:25,003 --> 00:19:25,836
Right? - [Jenna] I'm ready.

654
00:19:25,836 --> 00:19:26,670
Pretty much. - [James] Okay.

655
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:27,700
- [Jenna] I like it.

656
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,600
- [James] Okay, I'm gonna take a deep breath.

657
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,600
- [Jenna] It's hard.

658
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,470
- [James] I know.

659
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,519
- [Jenna] Okay.

660
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:32,490
(inhales)

661
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,760
Based on my personality and what you've seen of me

662
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,567
on YouTube so far, what type of dog do you think

663
00:19:36,567 --> 00:19:37,550
would be good for me?

664
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,500
- Something that is playful.

665
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,330
Honestly, if you were looking for a little dog

666
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:43,150
I'd say a Jack Russell terrier.

667
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:45,410
Something that you can just throw a ball with all day,

668
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:46,300
because you're high energy.

669
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,880
You have a lot of energy, a lot of love to give.

670
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,020
- Yes. This is true.

671
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,850
- You could handle a very high energy dog.

672
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:54,320
Except for the fact that you travel.

673
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,923
But just your personality.

674
00:19:55,923 --> 00:19:56,756
- You think?

675
00:19:56,756 --> 00:19:58,164
- Yeah, something really fun.

676
00:19:58,164 --> 00:19:59,030
- Look forward.

677
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:01,417
- Any dog would be lucky to have you as a dad.

678
00:20:01,417 --> 00:20:02,250
- Thanks sister. - Yeah.

679
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,440
- That wing looks awful.

680
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,214
- No it doesn't! What are you talking about?

681
00:20:06,214 --> 00:20:07,910
- It looks really good when you close, but.

682
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,710
- My face is hard. It's a challenge.

683
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:13,110
- Where do you usually put your wings?

684
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:13,943
- Everywhere.

685
00:20:13,943 --> 00:20:16,640
Like this one I have to do differently, because it's

686
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,790
I got wonky eye.

687
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,570
- [James] Uh-huh. I'm seeing that.

688
00:20:20,825 --> 00:20:22,137
Uh-oh. What do I do?

689
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:24,220
- [Jenna] See I get roasted all the time, I'm like, you guys

690
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,280
don't understand.

691
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,810
This is a hard face.

692
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:27,810
- Oh my god, it worked.

693
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,350
Oh my god I've never done that before.

694
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,700
For people that have hooded eyes, sometimes people

695
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,510
will draw a wing, I don't know that's like

696
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,600
it goes in and then ...

697
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,470
- It's like a hook.

698
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:35,700
- Yeah, kind of.

699
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,160
And I did that shape and it worked

700
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,970
because of that eye flap.

701
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:39,803
- Flappy.

702
00:20:39,803 --> 00:20:40,636
- But I still need to clean it up, because it still

703
00:20:40,636 --> 00:20:42,530
looks horrendous, but give me a second, and it'll look

704
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:43,555
better.

705
00:20:43,555 --> 00:20:44,734
- There's hope for us people with flappy eyes.

706
00:20:44,734 --> 00:20:45,567
- Yeah.

707
00:20:45,567 --> 00:20:46,770
- I never have this many colors on my eye,

708
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:47,830
I'm very excited.

709
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:48,870
- Do you like it?

710
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:51,066
- Yes. I can only do one color at a time.

711
00:20:51,066 --> 00:20:51,899
- Really?

712
00:20:51,899 --> 00:20:52,732
- Yeah, because I'll start blending

713
00:20:52,732 --> 00:20:54,539
and then before I know it, it's just in my eyebrow.

714
00:20:54,539 --> 00:20:55,372
- Oh that's good.

715
00:20:55,372 --> 00:20:56,890
- And all your brushes are really soft,

716
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,710
and mine are all sharp and owie,

717
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,170
and this is just really nice.

718
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:01,360
- Are they really?

719
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,193
Why?

720
00:21:02,193 --> 00:21:04,030
- I don't know. Probably just washing them

721
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,210
and pressing on them too hard.

722
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:07,280
- Do you need new ones? I can hook you up.

723
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,649
- No stop trying to give me stuff!

724
00:21:09,649 --> 00:21:10,482
- Why?

725
00:21:10,482 --> 00:21:11,315
- Because I pay stuff with my own money,

726
00:21:11,315 --> 00:21:13,603
I like to support you.

727
00:21:13,603 --> 00:21:15,400
- You need the James Charles X Morphe brush set.

728
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,650
- Hell yeah.

729
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,670
- If you think you're leaving here without it today,

730
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:18,503
you're wrong.

731
00:21:18,503 --> 00:21:19,360
- I'm leaving here without it.

732
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,412
- No you're not.

733
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:21,245
- Mm-hmm.

734
00:21:21,245 --> 00:21:23,030
- You brought me a plant, I can bring you a palette.

735
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,600
- Mm-mm. - Yes.

736
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,670
- Mm-mm. - Yes!

737
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:26,503
- No.

738
00:21:26,503 --> 00:21:28,210
I suddenly don't know how to use my hands.

739
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:29,700
I can't leave with it.

740
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,070
- Julien can carry it, it's okay.

741
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:31,903
- [Julien] Okay.

742
00:21:31,903 --> 00:21:33,210
- No, no, no, no, no.

743
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:35,320
Don't sabotage me like this, Julien.

744
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,680
- Hide the inner corner for a nice little pop.

745
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,513
- Oh my god, pop.

746
00:21:38,513 --> 00:21:40,290
- Okay so I'm gonna apply a lily lash

747
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:42,540
in the style Yass Queen.

748
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,553
- Wow.

749
00:21:43,553 --> 00:21:44,386
- Wow.

750
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,980
- Who's been some of your favorite people

751
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:50,700
that little James can't believe that you got to work with

752
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,790
so far?

753
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:52,980
- So many.

754
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,330
It's honestly most of the people that I've been able

755
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:56,163
to work with.

756
00:21:56,163 --> 00:21:58,130
You and Shane I grew up watching, so like this is

757
00:21:58,130 --> 00:21:59,690
super cool, my video with Shane has been amazing.

758
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:01,050
- Shane's pretty wonderful.

759
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:02,050
- He really is.

760
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:03,351
Demi.

761
00:22:03,351 --> 00:22:04,184
- Ooh.

762
00:22:04,184 --> 00:22:06,240
- We haven't filmed together yet, but like

763
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,190
she's just my favorite person in the entire world.

764
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:11,380
And I have had so many dark times, like her music

765
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,320
has helped me get through.

766
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,540
And now her and I literally text every day.

767
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:17,210
And it's so cool just to have that with somebody

768
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,590
you've looked up to forever, because she's just

769
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,630
literally the nicest.

770
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,260
Kylie and Kim, super, super dope.

771
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:23,320
They're like two of my favorites ever.

772
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,480
Pretty much everybody, like,

773
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,760
my subscribers are super supportive of me

774
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,691
so I don't really do a lot of collabs.

775
00:22:27,691 --> 00:22:29,920
And if I do do them, it's people that I've really

776
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,780
looked up to and respected for a while.

777
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:35,860
Like I refuse to do a collab just to gain subscribers,

778
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,190
I would never, because I don't need it.

779
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,330
My followers will still watch my content regardless

780
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:41,340
which is amazing.

781
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,031
So pretty much everybody that I've collabed with

782
00:22:43,031 --> 00:22:44,580
has been somebody that I've loved.

783
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,413
- That's so cool.

784
00:22:45,413 --> 00:22:46,890
- Which is really cool.

785
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:48,160
It's like my favorite part of the job.

786
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,680
Okay, we're gonna pop this on here,

787
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,200
and hope that looks good and fresh.

788
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,858
We're off to a good start now, do you like it?

789
00:22:52,858 --> 00:22:53,968
- I love it, it's so pretty.

790
00:22:53,968 --> 00:22:55,450
- Okay, it's looking good now!

791
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:57,090
Wow we love a good eyelash.

792
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:58,150
Okay great!

793
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:59,900
- That's something I learned many years ago,

794
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,010
like if you mess up on your eyeliner a little bit

795
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:04,312
just throw a thick lash on there, and it's like

796
00:23:04,312 --> 00:23:05,145
it never happened!

797
00:23:05,145 --> 00:23:06,330
- And it's gone!

798
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:08,380
That's such a good makeup tip, we're professionals!

799
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,320
Okay.

800
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,020
Alright you guys, so that is pretty much one eye

801
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,670
on sister Jenna all complete.

802
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:13,840
We're gonna go ahead and do the other one now

803
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,360
pretty quickly, but we'll be right back

804
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,100
to finish off the rest of the look.

805
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,250
Alright sisters we are back with both eyes all complete,

806
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,083
how are you feeling?

807
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:22,760
- Amazing, beautiful.

808
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,950
- I like how it's turning out.

809
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:26,270
I feel like it looks really stunning and good and fresh!

810
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:28,070
- I've done so much work here today.

811
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:30,560
- Alright you guys, we're gonna move on to the next step

812
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,870
which is of course going to be the glow.

813
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,130
Just a little bit of highlighter moment.

814
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:37,330
So we're gonna still stay within the James Charles palette

815
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:39,140
I'm just gonna grab of course Face.

816
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,120
- Ooh.

817
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,800
- Just grab an M501, I'm gonna give you a quick ...

818
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,890
(clattering)

819
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:44,723
Oops.

820
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:46,610
A quick spritz of some sister setting spray first,

821
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:48,600
just to kind of melt some of the powders in

822
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,270
now that we're all done with the eyeshadow.

823
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:51,830
Jenna if you were not doing YouTube, do you have

824
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,500
any idea what you would be doing right now?

825
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,238
- Well I mean I went to graduate school

826
00:23:55,238 --> 00:23:57,390
for sports psychology, so ...

827
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:58,223
- Oh!

828
00:23:58,223 --> 00:24:00,830
- I would probably honestly be working with kids.

829
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,630
I worked as a camp counselor for years,

830
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:04,542
and in graduate school we did ...

831
00:24:04,542 --> 00:24:05,375
Oh my ...

832
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:08,452
Oh! Oh my goodness! I'm gonna pass out!

833
00:24:08,452 --> 00:24:09,850
It never looks like that when I do it.

834
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:10,870
What? (gasps)

835
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:12,360
Oh, sorry. Goodness.

836
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,180
We did a program where we taught social responsibility

837
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:18,130
through physical activity for kids that

838
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:20,220
lived in underserved areas, and I worked

839
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,390
for the Boys and Girls Club for a lot of years.

840
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:23,223
- Oh my god!

841
00:24:23,223 --> 00:24:24,450
- So I would probably work with kids.

842
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:26,110
- I could see you definitely being like

843
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,840
an elementary school teacher.

844
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,080
I could definitely see that.

845
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,690
- Oh my god, it's so beautiful!

846
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:33,320
- You look so smooth and buttery!

847
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,200
- I am so smooth and buttery!

848
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,620
- So famous!

849
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,690
Okay, I'm gonna grab a little bit of Literally,

850
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:41,680
on a Anastasia A23 brush, this is like my favorite

851
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,610
shade in the palette for using a blush, highlight

852
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:46,360
mixer type of color, and I'm gonna use this

853
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,260
to blend together.

854
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:49,180
Oh that was a little much.

855
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,590
I'm going, look to your left, and then I have

856
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:51,900
one last question for you when we're done.

857
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,920
Gonna do a good little nude moment.

858
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,080
- What would you be doing if you weren't doing YouTube?

859
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,380
- I have no idea.

860
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,213
I think about that all the time.

861
00:24:57,213 --> 00:24:59,680
I would be in college right now, for sure.

862
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,800
- What would you study?

863
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,680
- I don't know.

864
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,680
I think because the fact that I did get into makeup

865
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,596
and hair right before I was done with high school,

866
00:25:07,596 --> 00:25:09,930
I don't know.

867
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:13,130
Because it did take up so much of my time and interest.

868
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:15,790
I've always been very into business and marketing,

869
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:17,000
that's always been my biggest passion

870
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,590
and that's always been what I'm really, really good at,

871
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:20,850
and still am good at to this day, that's what social media

872
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:22,840
is at the end of the day, is marketing and knowing how

873
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,830
to do it right.

874
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,807
So I feel like if I wasn't doing this, I'd be studying

875
00:25:25,807 --> 00:25:29,210
marketing, but at the same time too, because of the fact

876
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:31,470
that I already did have so much experience, I definitely

877
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:33,730
feel like it is one of those fields where you can

878
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:36,590
really learn a lot better when you're experiencing

879
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:37,423
those type of things.

880
00:25:37,423 --> 00:25:38,880
When I was already doing social media I took

881
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,350
a business marketing class at my high school

882
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:42,400
because we were offered it, and I was bored

883
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,233
out of my mind.

884
00:25:43,233 --> 00:25:47,470
- Well I think what's cool about social media now

885
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:49,540
is that you are the expert.

886
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,373
- Yeah.

887
00:25:50,373 --> 00:25:52,110
- Someone in the generation above you

888
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:55,620
probably wouldn't do as good of a job teaching it

889
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:58,460
than you, because you're sort of shaping the field

890
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,369
as you work in it.

891
00:25:59,369 --> 00:26:00,202
- Right.

892
00:26:00,202 --> 00:26:02,119
I think that is what is so cool about the YouTube world

893
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:04,070
too, and I think that it is really cool

894
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:05,910
because I'll get emails from professors all the time

895
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:08,030
or from different colleges that will ask

896
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,310
like influencers that come in and speak,

897
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:11,133
and that's dope, me being a 19 year old kid

898
00:26:11,133 --> 00:26:14,030
like gonna come in and teach a class on that.

899
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,967
That's like so cool, but it's really exciting for me,

900
00:26:15,967 --> 00:26:18,620
and I love giving advice to smaller influencers

901
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:21,390
and other creators, and my friends about marketing

902
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:23,137
and how to do brand deals, and who to work with

903
00:26:23,137 --> 00:26:24,565
and what to post on Instagram.

904
00:26:24,565 --> 00:26:26,100
I don't know I just feel like I really have

905
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,430
a knack for it, which is why I think I would definitely

906
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:30,870
want to work in beauty consultation once I'm done

907
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:32,760
being a guru and stuff, I don't know I just

908
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,440
really like thinking and analyzing and seeing

909
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,150
what's next, and figuring out how to stay relevant,

910
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:39,500
which actually brings me to my last question for you.

911
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,657
As someone who's been around for so long on the internet

912
00:26:41,657 --> 00:26:44,680
and has inspired people left and right, for the

913
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,460
younger sisters that have been out there watching

914
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,690
who may have been subscribed to you or me

915
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,530
who want to do YouTube one day, what is one piece of advice

916
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:53,980
you would give them in order to stay inspired

917
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,800
and also stay relevant for a while.

918
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:59,617
- Just do what you are excited about, you know?

919
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:01,525
Like for you that's makeup, and when we talk about

920
00:27:01,525 --> 00:27:03,600
what you'd be doing or what I'd be doing,

921
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,580
the world would be like, we would miss you

922
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,270
if you were doing that, like you could do that

923
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:11,160
and you'd be really wonderful, but what makes a bigger deal

924
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,520
or difference is when you actually do what's in your heart.

925
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,353
- Right. - Like what you want to do.

926
00:27:14,353 --> 00:27:15,186
- What you're passionate about.

927
00:27:15,186 --> 00:27:17,480
- Yeah, like a world without James Charles

928
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,500
not doing makeup would just be really weird

929
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,160
and not my favorite world, I like having you here.

930
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:22,993
- Thanks, angel.

931
00:27:22,993 --> 00:27:24,530
- Yeah, so when you actually do the stuff

932
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:27,100
that is interesting to you, it doesn't matter really

933
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,400
what platform you're doing it on,

934
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,520
or where you're doing it, as long as you have

935
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,940
a passion for it, you will find an audience for it

936
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:36,160
if you're coming from a place of genuine fun and interest

937
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,070
and having a good time.

938
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:37,903
- I always say that.

939
00:27:37,903 --> 00:27:40,480
It's really obvious who's in it for the right reasons,

940
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,523
and who isn't, and at the end of the day

941
00:27:41,523 --> 00:27:43,180
it's always the people who were doing it because

942
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,290
they really love it that stay around for a very, very

943
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:46,260
long time, which is why ...

944
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,787
- I just want to laugh.

945
00:27:47,787 --> 00:27:48,840
- You're still here.

946
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,940
- I just want to laugh, so I've just been able to do that

947
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,403
and if I don't have a job anymore that's okay

948
00:27:52,403 --> 00:27:55,243
because I'm probably just gonna keep laughing.

949
00:27:55,243 --> 00:27:57,558
I look so beautiful, James!

950
00:27:57,558 --> 00:27:58,940
- I think we're about to be done, sister

951
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:01,160
I'm gonna give you one last spritz,

952
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,200
and we'll show the final look.

953
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,783
(upbeat music)

954
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:21,580
Alright sisters, so this is the final look

955
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:23,630
on sister Jenna Marbles!

956
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:24,463
- I love it, James.

957
00:28:24,463 --> 00:28:25,432
- Do you like it?

958
00:28:25,432 --> 00:28:26,600
- Yeah. (squeals)

959
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,160
It's really sweet, thank you so much for doing this.

960
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,150
- Thank you so much for coming to my channel,

961
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:32,210
I feel like this has been in the works for such a long time

962
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,110
now and you've been such a huge role model to me

963
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:35,360
and so many other people as well,

964
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,370
and it was truly an honor to be able

965
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:38,210
to have glammed you up today

966
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:40,110
sister, I'm really glad you like the look.

967
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:41,927
- Thank you James, that's really nice of you.

968
00:28:41,927 --> 00:28:43,747
And I have a lot to learn from you as well,

969
00:28:43,747 --> 00:28:46,862
and it's been really nice to spend time with you.

970
00:28:46,862 --> 00:28:48,450
- You're my favorite thing ever in the entire world.

971
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:50,470
Well I hope you sisters enjoyed spending time with us

972
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:51,963
today as well and learned a little bit more--

973
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:52,940
- I'm gonna end up ruining the makeup look

974
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,453
by being an emotional mess, I'm sorry!

975
00:28:55,453 --> 00:28:56,640

(laughing)

989
00:29:20,857 --> 00:29:23,267
That was a weird way to say that.

990

- Thanks James.

998
00:29:34,324 --> 00:29:35,157
- And they're just getting better and better,

999
00:29:35,157 --> 00:29:35,990
and crazier.

1000
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:36,823
