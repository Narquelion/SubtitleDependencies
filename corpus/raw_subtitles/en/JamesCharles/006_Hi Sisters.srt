00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,920
- Hi sisters, James Charles here,

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,920
and welcome back to my YouTube channel.

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,860
Oh my gosh, it feels so weird to be sitting here

4
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:09,430
in the studio on camera recording this video for you guys,

5
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:12,350
but I am so beyond excited because it is about time,

6
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,850
and I am ready to come back and work so hard,

7
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:17,392
and to see all of you sisters. (squeals)

8
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:18,260
Okay, okay, okay.

9
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:19,480
I have a lot of thoughts, and I want to gather them

10
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,950
in this intro pretty quickly,

11
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,870
because this is gonna be a bit of a long video.

12
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,460
For those of you guys who do not know,

13
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,100
I basically just took a much-needed month-long break

14
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,810
from filming YouTube videos, and also from social media.

15
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:31,460
I've obviously been posting here and there,

16
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,020
kind of easing my way back into everything,

17
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:35,800
but it's been a very, very crazy month.

18
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,700
I've worked on a lot of fun things.

19
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,690
Let's be real, when I said that I was taking a social media

20
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:44,440
break, I kind of just meant from being so in it.

21
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,060
The past three years, I have been like literally addicted

22
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,110
to filming videos and checking my social media,

23
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,560
and it was so much fun, but it got to a point where it was

24
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:55,270
incredibly, incredibly toxic for me and my mental health,

25
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:57,670
and after everything that just went on on social media,

26
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,680
I just kind of needed some time to detox, slow it down.

27
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,460
Of course, still do what I absolutely love,

28
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,090
which is just handling business,

29
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:06,060
playing with makeup, and seeing my friends,

30
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,330
but just do it on like a little bit of a lower scale.

31
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:10,470
I'm really, really excited to say that after the last month

32
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,670
I've done a lot of growing and thinking.

33
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:15,080
I'm now able to leave my phone in another room,

34
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,450
and walk out and like enjoy life.

35
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:19,760
Which sounds so stupid, but like,

36
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,160
for me, that's like major, major progress.

37
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,320
I'm in a better state than I was mental-health wise.

38
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,010
I am just so blessed to have the same amazing friends

39
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:29,360
that I have around me, and it's been a really,

40
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,470
really incredible and eye-opening last month.

41
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:33,910
I'm very, very excited to tell you guys about it.

42
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:36,360
Obviously you guys know it is June, it is Pride month,

43
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,020
where all my fellow LGBTQ+ members get to thrive.

44
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,140
Literally my favorite time of the entire year.

45
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,350
One of the days I was playing with makeup,

46
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,260
I recreated a look by @chloefitzmua.

47
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,100
She did this like really cool rainbow dripping eye,

48
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,580
and it was so insane, it was so beautiful.

49
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,310
When I posted a story of it on my Instagram,

50
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,930
I got thousands and thousands of tweets and comments

51
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:58,320
asking me to film a tutorial on this Pride makeup look,

52
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,420
which is exactly what we're gonna

53
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,960
be doing in this video today.

54
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,270
We're gonna be playing with makeup and just doing

55
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,980
a little bit of a chit-chat, getting ready with me.

56
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:06,640
I have not filmed one in like literally over a year now,

57
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,350
which is is so crazy, but I'm so excited to just chill,

58
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:11,530
play with makeup, talk to you guys, fill you in

59
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,710
on what's been going on in my life for the past month,

60
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,060
and just talk about the future,

61
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,450
which I am so beyond excited for.

62
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,880
So if you guys want to see how I created

63
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,936
this look right here, keep on watching.

64
00:02:19,936 --> 00:02:24,936
(upbeat uplifting music) (harmonizing)

65
00:02:27,227 --> 00:02:29,270
All right you guys, let's just get started and get glam.

66
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,660
Usually when I do these type of makeup looks,

67
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,260
I start with my base already done.

68
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,240
So I'm just gonna kind of like,

69
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,710
go through it kind of quickly

70
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,200
with this little chit-chat get ready with me,

71
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,060
because the eye look took me a long, long, long time,

72
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,770
but it turned out so freaking bomb.

73
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:44,730
So I'm so excited to show you guys how I created it today.

74
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:47,010
I'm just starting off with my Tatcha Water Cream.

75
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:50,590
My skin has been disgusting recently.

76
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,850
It's really rude, like beyond homophobic.

77
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:55,040
In Pride Month too, how dare it.

78
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,560
I've been really taking extra care of my skincare recently.

79
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,760
Trying my best to get it kind of back to normal.

80
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,240
I digress, we're gonna be using very

81
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,435
full coverage foundation today, as always.

82
00:03:04,435 --> 00:03:06,720
Next I'm gonna grab the Tatcha Silk Canvas as well,

83
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,170
and just put this on my nose and my porous regions,

84
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:12,250
just to kind of smooth everything out.

85
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,160
Next I'm gonna grab a little bit of the Dragun Beauty,

86
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,000
I think it's the Skin Perfecting Potion,

87
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,920
and I'm just going to color correct my beard region.

88
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,180
I have been getting laser hair removal,

89
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,300
which has been absolutely amazing, because I hate shaving.

90
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,700
It is my least favorite thing in the entire world.

91
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,010
I think I'm only on like my fifth or sixth session,

92
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:30,170
and it usually takes like 10

93
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:32,590
before it actually like stops growing back for awhile.

94
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,940
So we're still gonna color correct,

95
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,710
and get these gray tones out of this beard,

96
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:37,940
because I do not want it showing through.

97
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,130
For foundation as always, I'm just gonna

98
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:40,590
grab my Too Faced Born This Way,

99
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,540
and I'm gonna mix together the shades Nude and Golden.

100
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,340
I got spray-tanned last week, but it's already kind of like

101
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,940
basically gone, so I'm not exactly sure

102
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,020
where my skin tone is gonna end up being.

103
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,630
Oh, that's actually like a good match.

104
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,370
I'd like to thank not only God, but also Jesus

105
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,990
for this incredible foundation today.

106
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,190
While I'm blending this out, I thought it would be

107
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,890
kind of fun to just like tell you a little bit

108
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:01,240
about what's been going on for the past few weeks.

109
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,720
I've been posting little stories here and there

110
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,300
to kind of keep you guys posted,

111
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,650
but it is so weird for me to not be like literally

112
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:09,230
posting everything I'm doing at all times of the day.

113
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:10,323
I turned 20.

114
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,970
Which is so gross, disgusting.

115
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:15,250
I've been really not looking forward

116
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,580
to my 20th birthday to be honest.

117
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,030
I'm not really sure why, I just

118
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,320
really, really liked being 19.

119
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,590
It was by far the best year of my entire life thus far.

120
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:25,027
Obviously knock on wood, I have many more to come.

121
00:04:25,027 --> 00:04:27,530
It was just really dope, and also, I feel like

122
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,460
a lot of my audience is very, very young as well.

123
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,660
So I feel like now that I'm 20, I'm like old,

124
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,400
and nobody can relate to me anymore.

125
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,920
Like, is this stupid, I don't know.

126
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,430
Then next year, it's like 21 when I'm like

127
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,330
an official adult, and then like can drink,

128
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:40,890
which literally does not even matter, because you guys know

129
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:43,360
that I don't do any of those things anyway.

130
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,900
I don't know, I feel like I'm getting old,

131
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,290
and I don't want to get old. (laughs)

132
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,690
Anyway, for my 20th birthday, my best friends and I

133
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,420
all celebrated together, and it was a day

134
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:54,260
that I will literally never forget, I had so much fun.

135
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,850
We took a boat ride over to Catalina Island,

136
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,990
which is basically just like a,

137
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,840
it's like a mini paradise honestly, off the coast

138
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,860
of California, and it was so, so, so beautiful.

139
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,300
We wanted to just spend a day on the boat

140
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,760
all together, swimming and relaxing

141
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,512
and listening to music and just having fun.

142
00:05:09,512 --> 00:05:10,520
We were supposed to go parasailing too,

143
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,030
which I was so excited to do.

144
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,810
I've literally, that's like on my bucket list.

145
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:15,830
I want to go parasailing so freaking badly.

146
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,197
It just sounds like it would be so much fun,

147
00:05:17,197 --> 00:05:18,330
but the weather was really windy,

148
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:19,960
so we weren't able to do that, which sucked,

149
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,150
but instead we got to have a really, really

150
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:24,410
nice lunch on the water, which was so delicious.

151
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:25,630
I think I got fish and chips,

152
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:28,220
and then we got to rent a golf cart,

153
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,050
and we got to drive around the entire island,

154
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:32,500
which was so much fun okay.

155
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,490
For those of you guys who have been following me

156
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:36,480
for a very, very long time, about two years ago,

157
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,410
you guys know my best friend Laura,

158
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,720
we went to, I think the US Virgin Islands

159
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,270
with Benefit Cosmetics, which was probably the best trip

160
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,650
that I've ever been on in my entire life.

161
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,700
It brought back memories, because when we were on the island

162
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,792
we got to ride around in golf carts.

163
00:05:48,792 --> 00:05:51,820
Laura and I one night accidentally

164
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,070
drove the golf cart off of the cliff.

165
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,570
So yeah, that happened.

166
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:57,030
I don't really have anything else to say, but I don't

167
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:59,200
want to talk about it, dark memories, we were fine.

168
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,300
So getting the chance to ride together

169
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,120
on a golf cart again was exciting,

170
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,160
but also literally mortifying for everybody involved.

171
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,200
We split into two different groups,

172
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,850
and we got to ride around the entire island,

173
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,815
which was such an incredible experience.

174
00:06:10,815 --> 00:06:15,815
(group cheering) (engines roaring)

175
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:20,310
We got to sight-see and see the village,

176
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,580
and also go to the top of the mountain

177
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:24,960
and see literally the most beautiful views ever.

178
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,040
Also too, on the way down the mountain,

179
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,140
it was around I think like two or three o'clock,

180
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,920
so all of the kids were getting out of school,

181
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,480
and we passed one group of kids on the way down,

182
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,777
and one girl turned and was like,

183
00:06:34,777 --> 00:06:36,370
"Oh my god, that's James Charles."

184
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:40,040
And within seconds, we literally had the entire like school

185
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,600
running after our golf cart, which was probably the most

186
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,740
crazy experience ever in the entire world, it was so fun.

187
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,450
So we got back, we returned the golf carts.

188
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:48,560
I think we went to get Starbucks

189
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,600
and a little bit of ice cream,

190
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,080
then we went to the beach to take a little bit of a nap

191
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,170
and just kind of rest and get everything together.

192
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:56,220
In the middle of my nap, Drew woke me up,

193
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,910
and as soon as I got up, I looked at the edge of the beach,

194
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:01,250
and literally like 100 different school kids

195
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,372
were all lined up, and started singing Happy Birthday to me.

196
00:07:04,372 --> 00:07:07,291
- [Group] Dear James, happy birthday to you.

197
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:12,291
- Oh my god, thank you guys. (cheering)

198
00:07:13,153 --> 00:07:13,986
Thank you all.

199
00:07:13,986 --> 00:07:17,020
And I literally started bawling, it was so cute,

200
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,620
and it just made my day so, so, so magical.

201
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,850
I literally could not stop smiling, oh my gosh.

202
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:24,280
Just the act that all them took the time to find us

203
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,060
and sing to me, just made my birthday so, so, so special

204
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,977
and I got to take photos with every single one of them,

205
00:07:28,977 --> 00:07:30,933
and they were all so sweet.

206
00:07:30,933 --> 00:07:32,970
- [Group] Hi, sisters!

207
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,580
- It was just a really cool and heartwarming experience

208
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,750
to get kind of a little glimpse into their world, of like

209
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,350
the island life, because it's so different than my world,

210
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:41,190
even though we're literally like right next to each other.

211
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,750
So that was so much fun.

212
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,580
If you're watching this, and you were on Catalina Island,

213
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,760
I love you, thank you for being

214
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,770
the absolute sweetest and making my entire birthday.

215
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,390
I'm actually loving how my skin is looking right now,

216
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:51,130
despite the fact that it is beyond dry

217
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:52,170
and literally crusting off.

218
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:54,770
Somehow it looks smooth, I'm happy.

219
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,330
I'm gonna move on and set my face in place

220
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:58,000
using a mixture of setting powders.

221
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,460
I think a really long time ago I did a video

222
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,330
about mixing all of my setting powders together,

223
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:03,570
and it literally made my skin look so good.

224
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,720
I was on set for a photo shoot and music video yesterday

225
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,680
for over 12 hours, and by the end of it,

226
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,427
my makeup still looked like I just put it on.

227
00:08:09,427 --> 00:08:11,580
I'm not kidding, that has never happened to me before

228
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:14,410
with no retouches, and I feel like, I don't know,

229
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,540
but it could be the powder.

230
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:18,110
I'm obsessed with this mixture, and I'm never gonna

231
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:20,020
let myself go back to just one setting powder ever again,

232
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,451
because I need to lock this in.

233
00:08:22,451 --> 00:08:23,510
Aside from my birthday, one thing that I've been

234
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,890
working on a lot over the past month has been music,

235
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:28,300
which I'm so, so excited about.

236
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,250
There was one night that my friends and I

237
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,440
were having a sleepover, and I ended up staying up

238
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,170
until like five or six in the morning.

239
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:35,090
I don't know why, we literally just could not go to sleep,

240
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:37,760
and when I woke up the next morning, I opened my laptop

241
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,330
to start replying to business emails

242
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:41,270
because it was a Monday, and I realized

243
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,780
that we had stayed up until five or six in the morning

244
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,990
working on an acapella arrangement of the national anthem.

245
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:49,100
I still to this day, like don't really remember working

246
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,080
on it, but I posted it on my stories and on my Twitter

247
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,791
because it was hilarious and absolutely awful.

248
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:57,624
(off-tune electronic singing)

249
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:00,153
And so many people were like, "Oh my God,

250
00:09:00,153 --> 00:09:01,557
"you should actually try to record this

251
00:09:01,557 --> 00:09:03,338
"and make it sound really, really good."

252
00:09:03,338 --> 00:09:04,171
So that is exactly what I did.

253
00:09:04,171 --> 00:09:06,780
I invited my friends Zoe and Gabe over, who you guys know

254
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,120
from the acapella group I was in, Flashback,

255
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,920
and we literally just spent the entire day

256
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,860
singing the national anthem and celebrating America,

257
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,310
which was so much fun, and by the end of it,

258
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:17,480
oh my god, I was so, so, so pumped.

259
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,643
I posted a video of it on my Instagram.

260
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:23,643
♪ That our flag was still there ♪

261
00:09:24,653 --> 00:09:27,653
(group harmonizing)

262
00:09:29,246 --> 00:09:30,810
- And so many of you guys were being so supportive,

263
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:32,950
which I was just so excited about.

264
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:35,790
Actually, my good friend Austin McBroom of the ACE Family,

265
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,440
invited us to sing the national anthem

266
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,200
at the ACE Family basketball game at the end of the month,

267
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,090
which I am so beyond pumped for.

268
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,700
Also really nervous because it's like,

269
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,480
literally the hardest song in the entire world to sing,

270
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,310
but I think it'll go really, really well, fingers crossed.

271
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:48,250
It was so funny too, because

272
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,890
when the poster for the game first went up,

273
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:52,280
it just said, "National Anthem: James Charles."

274
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,390
Then everybody started freaking out.

275
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:56,440
I don't blame you, but I'm promising you right now

276
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,220
I will never try to sing the national anthem alone.

277
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,143
I am well aware of the fact

278
00:10:00,143 --> 00:10:02,500
that it would sound absolutely awful.

279
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,890
I don't have the range for it, I need my fellow

280
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:07,580
two harmonizers to make the arrangement amazing,

281
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,600
but I'm really, really excited for the event,

282
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,370
and hopefully you guys will tune in.

283
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:12,203
Alongside of the national anthem, I also got to go to

284
00:10:12,203 --> 00:10:14,360
a music studio for a very, very exciting project,

285
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,550
which you guys will be seeing very, very soon.

286
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,260
If you remember at the beginning of the year

287
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:21,450
I went to Nashville, Tennessee and met the Cimorelli girls

288
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,580
for the very first time, and still to this day,

289
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,820
probably one of the best weeks of my entire life.

290
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,770
Love them the absolute most.

291
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:29,840
We did three videos together actually,

292
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,400
a harmonizing challenge on their channel,

293
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,630
and then a Demi Lovato medley, and then on my channel

294
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,170
we did our cover of Never Enough,

295
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:37,290
which is probably my favorite video of all time,

296
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:39,190
and also one of my most-viewed videos of all time,

297
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:41,490
which is so crazy that you guys loved it that much.

298
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:42,550
It means the absolute world.

299
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,100
After being in a group chat together and talking

300
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,690
almost every single day for six months

301
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:47,860
and not seeing each other, we were getting deprived,

302
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,080
so the Cimorelli girls flew into LA and we got to

303
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,877
spend the week together, which was so, so, so much fun.

304
00:10:52,877 --> 00:10:53,710
(exclaims loudly)

305
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:54,543
They were filming a ton of different videos,

306
00:10:54,543 --> 00:10:56,990
working super hard, as always, but we definitely made time

307
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,650
to just chill and hang out together,

308
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,670
and of course create some really amazing music,

309
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,520
which I am so pumped for you guys to see.

310
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,750
These videos may, maybe even be better than the first ones.

311
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,480
I don't know, I don't want to put it into the universe.

312
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,160
I'm gonna let you guys decide obviously when they come out,

313
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,667
but they are so good, and I am so excited

314
00:11:10,667 --> 00:11:12,150
for you guys to see them.

315
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,390
Just singing with the Cimorelli girls

316
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,657
and being around them is just like literally

317
00:11:14,657 --> 00:11:16,360
one of my favorite things in the entire world.

318
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,040
They are all just the most amazing and kind people,

319
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,660
and they are exactly what I needed during this break

320
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,230
just to kind of raise my spirits.

321
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:25,011
And I am so glad and so excited for you guys

322
00:11:25,011 --> 00:11:26,500
to see the videos that we have coming very, very soon.

323
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,260
Now that my contour's all done, I'm just going to

324
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,700
bake my face using that same mix of setting powders.

325
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,350
Then we're going to move on to (pops tongue) the eyebrows.

326
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,410
A lot of times I skip my brows in my videos just because

327
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:38,860
it's kind of the same process over and over again, but,

328
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,920
but I'm gonna include it today because

329
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,180
I have a fun little new technique that I want to try out.

330
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,990
So I'm gonna grab my Anastasia Brow Wiz, just like always,

331
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,520
in Medium Brown, first and start sketching them in.

332
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,570
I'm gonna try my best to talk during this brow portion.

333
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:53,040
So if these turn out absolutely disgusting

334
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,560
like 2016 James Charles' brows, it's not my fault (laughs).

335
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,910
So like I was saying in the beginning of the video,

336
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,300
I was really, really excited to actually have

337
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,820
a little bit of time off this month because I got to use

338
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,360
a lot of it to play with makeup.

339
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,330
Now obviously makeup is my job,

340
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,160
and I literally love doing what I do,

341
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,610
I would not change it for the entire world,

342
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:12,680
but sometimes when I'm filming or just going to events,

343
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,510
it starts to get a little bit less fun because

344
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:17,200
I don't get to be as creative as I normally want to be.

345
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,190
So because I had nothing to do, I got to really sit down

346
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:21,930
and literally do whatever look I wanted to do,

347
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:24,190
which you guys obviously saw on my Snapchat.

348
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:26,880
I did a drag look, and we did like a whole fun little

349
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,310
photo shoot in my bed with my team, which was so much fun.

350
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:32,480
I'm gonna insert a little bit of vlog footage right here

351
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,356
if you guys want to see some of that, because it was crazy.

352
00:12:35,356 --> 00:12:36,450
(camera flash whining) (shutter clicking)

353
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:37,840
- Merci. - That's a man!

354
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,330
That is a man, (laughs) that is a whole entire man.

355
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:43,150
(woman laughing) Oh lord Jesus

356
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,909
in heaven above. (shutter clicking)

357
00:12:44,909 --> 00:12:46,890
Oof. (laughing)

358
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:48,370
Oh, that one's kind of, oh, the nipple's showing.

359
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:49,710
Aside from doing my own makeup though,

360
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:52,630
one thing that I have been dying to do for the past

361
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,500
honestly several months now, has been get my makeup done

362
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,753
by a few different makeup artists that I love the work of.

363
00:12:56,753 --> 00:12:58,810
I've just been wanting to get my makeup done, and then

364
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,000
look at the finished result and just like analyze it.

365
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,540
Look at things that I love, look at things

366
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,960
that I don't love as much on my face.

367
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,980
Spoiler alert, all of the artists absolutely killed it.

368
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,590
I worked with my good friend Eros,

369
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:10,120
my friend Arielle Espana, and then also Glam Tech Steven T,

370
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,090
and I looked so freaking beautiful.

371
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:13,410
It was just really, really fun to work with some new

372
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:15,810
artists, see my face in a way that I don't see it every day,

373
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:17,710
and also pick up a lot of new techniques as well.

374
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,610
You guys know that I have kind of fallen into the trap

375
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:21,810
of using the same products and techniques

376
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:23,152
a lot. (laughs)

377
00:13:23,152 --> 00:13:24,060
But I feel like I learned a lot,

378
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,960
and I'm really excited to implement them into my routine,

379
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,200
because I feel like that's what being an artist

380
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,150
is really all about at the end of the day, and try them

381
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:32,520
on for you guys, which we're gonna do (snaps) right now.

382
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,030
Now that my brows are all filled in, and I like

383
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:36,300
the shape that they are kind of going in right now,

384
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,780
before I go in and cut it with concealer,

385
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:40,270
I'm gonna grab the Anastasia Dipbrow Gel.

386
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:42,120
Now if you guys remember a few videos ago,

387
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,550
I talked about the new Dipbrow Gel kind of in depth.

388
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,310
It is a new product to the Anastasia Brow line.

389
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:47,930
I'm obsessed with it, it's basically

390
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:50,120
a mix of Dipbrow and eyebrow

391
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,230
gel, duh, hence the name Dipbrow Gel.

392
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:54,620
It's a very, very full-coverage brow gel.

393
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:57,330
When I was getting glammed by my good friend Arielle Espana,

394
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:00,200
she actually used this color, which is blonde, okay,

395
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,640
obviously I'm not a blonde,

396
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,550
but to set the brow hairs in place after,

397
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,830
and it really, really lightened them up

398
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:06,630
and kind of gave them this like gray effect,

399
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,350
and I was obsessed with it looked.

400
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,510
I thought it looked so cool, it was a very, very

401
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,120
different look for me, and I want to try it out today.

402
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,970
So I'm gonna grab Dipbrow Gel in the shade Blonde,

403
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:16,470
and I'm gonna go in and just kind of

404
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:20,400
brush this through the hairs right in the front.

405
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,420
Then kind of like fade it in,

406
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:25,420
and this is gonna kind of give us that like Instagram

407
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:28,773
ombre brow type of look, look at that.

408
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:33,063
Oh, that's good, that looks so good, oh my god.

409
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:35,980
I love that, I love this technique.

410
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,570
Thank you Arielle for showing this to me.

411
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:39,090
Thank you Anastasia for creating

412
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:40,360
a really, really bomb product.

413
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,243
See this is why I love working with new artists,

414
00:14:41,243 --> 00:14:43,510
because you never know what techniques you're gonna pick up

415
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,350
and how you could change your routine.

416
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:46,693
I definitely want to keep doing this,

417
00:14:46,693 --> 00:14:49,210
because this looks really, really good and fresh.

418
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:51,160
Okay, I'm gonna do the other brow off-camera quickly,

419
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,190
cut them with concealer, and I'll be

420
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,150
right back to start off the eyes.

421
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,030
All right you guys, we are back,

422
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,900
and both eyebrows are on and slayed.

423
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,580
Now it is time to move on to the eye looks,

424
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:01,430
where we are recreating this like dripping Pride look

425
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:03,610
inspired by @chloefitzmua.

426
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:05,830
For this tutorial today, I'm gonna be grabbing the brand-new

427
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:08,910
Morphe 25L palette, I know shocking,

428
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,380
not the James Charles palette, we're probably

429
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,850
still gonna grab one at some point later on.

430
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:15,740
But this is the brand-new 25L Live in Color palette,

431
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,820
and this is part of Morphe's Pride collection.

432
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,300
It is a beautiful rainbow palette obviously, and aside from

433
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,230
the white and black, none of the shades in here

434
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,900
are dupes of the colors in my palette.

435
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,290
They're completely unique and different.

436
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:26,643
Both beautiful rainbows, and I am

437
00:15:26,643 --> 00:15:28,180
so excited to play with it today.

438
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,380
They also launched a Pride brush set as well,

439
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,960
which I'm going to dip into.

440
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,100
If you guys want to check this out, here's the catch though,

441
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,890
you can't use code James.

442
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:38,077
Now shocking, I know you've heard me say this

443
00:15:38,077 --> 00:15:41,050
literally a million times, but I'm really, really excited

444
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:43,310
because with Morphe's Pride collection,

445
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,318
they actually announced that they would be donating

446
00:15:45,318 --> 00:15:49,860
100% of the net proceeds to The Trevor Project.

447
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,580
The Trevor Project, in case you have not heard of it

448
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,910
or don't know, is a charity that deals with anti-bullying

449
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,550
and suicide prevention and awareness

450
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,210
here in the LGBTQ+ community,

451
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:59,590
and the work that they have done is absolutely amazing,

452
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:00,423
and obviously you guys know

453
00:16:00,423 --> 00:16:02,070
I love Morphe and work super closely with them.

454
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,720
So this partnership, I truly feel like

455
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,720
is like a match made in heaven, and I am just

456
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,780
so excited and so proud of Morphe for doing this.

457
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:11,740
Literally they're making zero dollars on this campaign.

458
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,470
Everything is going to help the community.

459
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:15,100
Check it out if you guys want to, it's really, really

460
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,350
amazing, and your money is going to an amazing cause.

461
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,300
To start off my eyes today, I'm gonna grab the brand-new

462
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,710
Anastasia Beverly Hills Eye Primer.

463
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,380
This actually launched at the same time as their

464
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,550
summer collection and the collab with Alyssa Edwards,

465
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,610
which I from so excited to check out as well.

466
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:28,750
Definitely let me know if you guys want

467
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,900
to see a video using the Alyssa palette.

468
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,670
I freaking love her, but for now

469
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:37,007
I'm just going to take a flat brush, this is the M166,

470
00:16:37,007 --> 00:16:39,500
and I pat a little bit of this primer onto my eyelid

471
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,420
so the shadows have something to stick to.

472
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:44,090
I'm first gonna grab my M431, this is just the pencil brush

473
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:45,600
that is available in my brush set,

474
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,370
and dip into the bright red shade, which is called Life.

475
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:51,920
And tapping off the excess, I'm going to pop this

476
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,930
right in my inner corner to start off that rainbow ombre.

477
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,710
Next we got the same brush, I'm just going to wipe off

478
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:58,320
the excess on the edge of my hand, and then dip

479
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,550
into the bright orange shade, which is called Pride,

480
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,620
and I'm gonna put that right next to the red.

481
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,540
I'm just really taking my time in packing those colors

482
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:08,220
on there, and slowly kind of blending as I go.

483
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,110
Blending together matte bright shades

484
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:12,210
is one of the hardest techniques to do in makeup,

485
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:14,457
and it really does take a little bit of patience, so.

486
00:17:14,457 --> 00:17:16,760
Got to make sure we get that nice ombre blend.

487
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,160
Next with another pencil brush, I'm just gonna

488
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,950
grab the shade Sunlight, which is the bright yellow,

489
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:23,480
and pop that next to the orange.

490
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,750
Oh wow, that is a bomb yellow.

491
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,130
Next with another pencil brush, I'm gonna grab

492
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,360
the shade Nature in the bottom of the palette,

493
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,750
it is the bright lime green, and put this next to Sunlight.

494
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,670
For the blue shade, I'm just gonna grab an M124

495
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:38,070
and dip into the shade of Playground from my palette,

496
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:41,250
just because the 25L doesn't have a matte blue in it.

497
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:44,590
I'm just tapping this in to kind of form that outer V shape.

498
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:46,490
Going back on a little bit of Nature

499
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:48,930
to blend those two together.

500
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:50,940
Gonna grab a little bit of Truth and Love Wins

501
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,350
mixed together to create a neutral purple shade,

502
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:56,860
and use this to kind of sketch out the outer point.

503
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,013
Now I'm just gonna go back in with the same colors

504
00:17:58,013 --> 00:17:59,570
that we used before just to kind of

505
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:01,180
finesse a little bit of this blending in here.

506
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,120
Okay so now we're gonna move on

507
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,970
to the concealer little drips and creating that 3D effect.

508
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:06,770
So I'm gonna grab my Tarte Shape Tape,

509
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:08,540
and this is in the shade Light Medium Honey,

510
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,610
which is the same color that I used to cut my eyebrow,

511
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:13,150
and a tiny liner brush, gonna dip into that concealer

512
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:15,830
on the back of my hand, and super, super carefully

513
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:18,160
and slowly I'm gonna start drawing in my little drips.

514
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,010
All the drips should kind of follow this general shape,

515
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:21,960
which is basically just like a line down, and then

516
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,350
a kind of dot at the end to simulate the paint drip.

517
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:27,370
You all know what a drip looks like, just follow me.

518
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:29,100
You want to keep dipping back into your concealer as well

519
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,320
because when you go over these colors, the concealer

520
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,800
is going to mix with the pigment underneath on the brush,

521
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,510
and you don't want the paint drips to look like

522
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,900
light green, or light blue,

523
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,520
or light whatever color you're over.

524
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,950
You want them to look like that nude concealer color,

525
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:42,140
so don't be afraid to use a lot.

526
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,250
While this concealer is still wet,

527
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,430
I'm gonna grab the tiniest little packing brush I can find.

528
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:48,630
This is the E39, and dip it into the shade Canvas

529
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:51,120
from my palette, which is the like light bone-color shade,

530
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,850
it's pretty close in color to the color of my concealer,

531
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:56,060
and I'm just gonna start patting this over top

532
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,760
to set that concealer in place.

533
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,460
Okay, so now we need to add the shadows and highlights

534
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,680
to the eye look, so it actually looks

535
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,530
three-dimensional and it looks like it's dripping.

536
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:04,860
This is where it gets fun, or a lot less fun

537
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,670
if you have no patience. (laughs)

538
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,270
I'm gonna grab an E35 brush,

539
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:10,780
this is just a super, super tiny flat brush,

540
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,640
and I'm gonna use a mixture of the 25L

541
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,960
and my palette just to grab some darker shades.

542
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,910
I'm first gonna grab Boutique on this brush,

543
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:19,550
which is just a dark maroon red,

544
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,210
and a little bit of Benny as well,

545
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:25,200
and very, very carefully I'm going to use this color

546
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,440
right up against those lines that we created

547
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,620
with the concealer to form shadows.

548
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,370
Okay I'm not using this brush, that was a bad idea.

549
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,530
I'm actually using the M250-0 inside,

550
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:34,820
which is a liner brush.

551
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,120
If you make any mistakes along the way,

552
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,830
just grab you a tiny little dab of concealer

553
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,800
and you can easily fix it up.

554
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,610
Next I'm gonna grab a little bit of 10% Off,

555
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:44,190
which is just a deep burnt orange shade,

556
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:47,760
and use this to shade right underneath the Pride color.

557
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,370
Next I'm gonna grab a little bit of Tea,

558
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:50,910
and use this to shade the yellow.

559
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:52,440
Next I'm gonna grab a little bit of Daddy,

560
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,810
which is the deep green color,

561
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:57,090
and use this to create the shadow in Nature.

562
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:00,900
Then a little bit of NYC and Parade mixed together

563
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,440
to shade in that Teal region.

564
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,210
Spooky and Cola for the blue section,

565
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:08,240
and then Spooky and Escape for the purple finally.

566
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,190
Once your shadows are all done,

567
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:11,550
it is time to add the last step, which is highlights.

568
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:12,930
To add in the highlights, all I'm gonna do is grab

569
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:16,840
a tiny little bit of white concealer on the back of my hand,

570
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,870
and that same exact liner brush.

571
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,730
I'm gonna add in tiny little reflections

572
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:24,350
on the bottom right edges of all of the bubbles,

573
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,183
and you just want to keep in mind

574
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:27,770
that all the reflections should be on the same side.

575
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:29,620
You can also add in tiny little highlights

576
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:32,150
to any of the like, little droops,

577
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:33,590
just so it looks a little bit more real.

578
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:36,357
Yes, guide my way. (clicks tongue)

579
00:20:36,357 --> 00:20:37,390
That was disgusting, that was gross.

580
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:38,410
I regret that, I'm sorry.

581
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:39,530
So that is pretty much the whole

582
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,080
drip technique, all complete.

583
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,960
Like I said, obsessed with how this looks.

584
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,640
I'm now gonna move on to the lower lash line,

585
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,520
but first I want to grab a tiny little brush,

586
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,940
and I'm going to highlight my brow bone using this

587
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:54,710
bright gold shade in the 25L palette called Stonewall.

588
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:56,060
Now we're gonna do the lower lash line.

589
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:58,340
Just gonna grab those same colors going back in the rainbow,

590
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,300
so first gonna do Playground.

591
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,700
Connecting that up to the little wing that we created.

592
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,940
Then Nature, then Sunlight, then Pride,

593
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,670
then last but not least, just a tiny

594
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:09,950
little bit of Life on the inner corner.

595
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:11,070
With that same brush from before,

596
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,830
we're gonna grab a little bit more Stonewall and just

597
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:15,900
put that right in the inner corner over top of Life.

598
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,440
That's like too bright, okay hold on, let me grab

599
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,500
a little bit of Literally from my palette instead,

600
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,990
which is a little bit more of a muted color,

601
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:26,150
and layer that over top.

602
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:27,870
Never thought I'd be saying a highlight would be too bright,

603
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,310
but I guess there's a first (chuckles) for everything.

604
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:31,630
All right you guys, and that is one eye all complete.

605
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,970
Definitely a lot of steps involved with this look,

606
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:36,197
but not too complicated if you have a little bit of patience

607
00:21:36,197 --> 00:21:38,860
and a very, very steady hand.

608
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,620
I'm gonna go ahead and do the other eye off-camera quickly,

609
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,970
and try my best to kind of match her,

610
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:43,490
or at least get relatively close.

611
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:45,550
Obviously the drips don't have to be perfectly symmetrical,

612
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,770
and I'll be right back to finish off the rest of the look.

613
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:50,110
All right you guys, we are back with the other eye done.

614
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:52,350
I just popped on mascara and false lashes.

615
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:55,680
These are the Lilly Lashes in the style So Extra Miami.

616
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,840
Literally my favorite pair of all time right now.

617
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,823
They out beat Miami by like, kind of a lot.

618
00:21:59,823 --> 00:22:01,300
I like how dramatic they are,

619
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,720
and you guys can use code JAMES for 15% off

620
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,050
your purchase if you want to check them out.

621
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:06,300
I already went ahead and wiped off my bake,

622
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,700
so I'm gonna give my face a quick spritz

623
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,550
of the Morphe Prep & Set setting spray.

624
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:14,070
Then I'm going to grab the 25L palette once again actually,

625
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,990
and dipping into that Stonewall shade once again,

626
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:20,243
I'm gonna use this to highlight and see how this looks, ooh.

627
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:23,960
Oh my god, that is so pretty.

628
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,560
Wow, I really like how that looks.

629
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:28,093
Little bit above the eyebrow bone, as always.

630
00:22:28,093 --> 00:22:31,200
Then I'm gonna use that color to highlight my nose bridge.

631
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,550
Now that that highlight is all placed on there,

632
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,120
I'm just gonna grab that same exact brush

633
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,440
and dip into Literally from my palette,

634
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,410
and use this to blend together the blush and highlight.

635
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:42,130
This is literally my favorite trick to do.

636
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:45,468
It looks so oh my god, it looks so pretty.

637
00:22:45,468 --> 00:22:46,410
So actually in real life as well,

638
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:48,890
you can really see that pink shift to the highlight and,

639
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:50,120
oh my god like, yeah.

640
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,030
Since the eyes are very, very intense on this look,

641
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,390
I definitely don't want to take the attention away

642
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:55,890
from this area, so I'm just gonna apply a nude lip,

643
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:57,000
and use my favorite combo the

644
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,880
ColourPop iluvsarahii lip liner in Curvii.

645
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,700
Then just adding a tiny little bit of gloss in the center.

646
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,170
Then last, but finally not least,

647
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:04,500
finishing off this look with a spritz

648
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,489
of the brand-new Anastasia Dewy Set Setting Spray.

dripping, rainbow, Pride Month makeup tutorial all complete.

658
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,440
I am literally obsessed with how this look turned out.

659
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,220
Oh my gosh, I am so glad

660
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,800
that you guys asked me to film this.

661
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,860
Literally the first time that I posted it on my Snapchat,

662
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,090
I started getting comments right away,

663
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:42,747
and I was so annoyed, because I'm like,

664
00:23:42,747 --> 00:23:44,057
"Oh my god, I just spent six hours on this,

665
00:23:44,057 --> 00:23:46,100
"why did I not think to film it?"

666
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,470
But I'm so glad that I got to sit down and play with makeup

667
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:49,890
and do this look again today.

668
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:52,140
Thank you once again to @chloefitzmua

669
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,660
for inspiring this look.

670
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,460
All you sisters, make sure to go check her out

671
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,010
and show her some love and support.

672
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:58,540
I'm sure she would really, really appreciate it,

673
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,020
and she's the genius behind this

674
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,740
original concept and this Pride makeup look.

675
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:05,050
I really hope you guys enjoyed this video today as well.

676
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:06,280
I really don't film chit-chat

677
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,220
get ready with me's kind of ever either.

678
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,470
Honestly I've always been a little bit scared to do them,

679
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:12,640
because I feel like we do so many crazy things

680
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,190
on this channel, that people don't even care

681
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:15,260
about these type of videos anymore,

682
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,280
but I really hope that you guys enjoyed this video.

683
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,750
I definitely had a lot of fun sitting down today,

684
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,170
talking to you guys one-on-one,

685
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:22,550
giving you a little bit of a life update,

686
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,970
but most importantly, taking some time

687
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:25,220
and doing what I love doing the most,

688
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,160
and why you guys are all here on this channel,

689
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,690
which is playing with makeup.

690
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:30,110
So, I loved filming this today,

691
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:31,600
and I really hope you guys liked it, too.

692
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,290
If you did, please don't forget to give it

693
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:35,590
a big thumbs up down below, and show your love and support.

694
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:37,510
It would mean so, so, so much to me.

695
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,740
Also leave me a comment and let me know

696
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,660
what type of videos you guys want to see

697
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,673
now that I am back here on YouTube filming once again.

698
00:24:42,673 --> 00:24:44,940
I am so pumped to get back to work.

699
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,780
The last month has been a much-needed mental break,

700
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,000
but I'm also going crazy.

701
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,390
You guys know I'm a workaholic, and a sister is ready

702
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:53,368
to get back to work, and I hope you guys are excited.

703
00:24:53,368 --> 00:24:54,530

704
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:56,300

and come join at this sisterhood.

706
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,250
I would love to have you in the family,

and also click that bell icon so you get a notification

708

709
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,790
If you'd like to follow me on my makeup journey,

00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:07,060

711

they're both just jamescharles.

712
00:25:08,408 --> 00:25:09,930
My Snapchat for more behind-the-scenes type stuff

713
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:12,480
is jamescharless, with an extra s after Charles.

714
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,987
One last quick thing before we end off today's video,

715
00:25:13,987 --> 00:25:16,730
I've been getting a lot of questions about Sisters Apparel,

716
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:19,320
so I thought I'd give you guys a super quick update.

717
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,410
We did have to switch our merchandise partners, but we have

718
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:23,910
a new company that I am very, very excited to be working

719
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:26,540
with, and we should be up and running very, very soon.

720
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,170
Obviously I will keep you guys posted.

721
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:29,940
We did have a summer collection planned for the middle

722
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,850
of May that has a ton of items that I am so pumped for.

723
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:35,280
The Sister Slides that I showed you guys months ago,

724
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,440
that I've been getting so many questions about,

725
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,890
literally like to this day, Sister Slides is like one of

726
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:42,600
the most searched terms on the Sisters Apparel website,

727
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,010
and they're not even out yet.

728
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:45,170
We have water bottles as well,

729
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:47,250
perfect for the summertime or working out.

730
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,720
Also Sisters swimwear too, swim trunks,

731
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:53,070
and a one-piece bathing suit, they are so beyond cute.

732
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,930
Then for June, Pride Month, we had our

733
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:57,330
Rainbow Artistry Collection coming back as well

734
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:58,650
with a few new added pieces

735
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:00,490
that I am so pumped to show you guys.

736
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:01,520
With everything that has gone on,

737
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,870
we did have to push both launches backwards,

738
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:05,355
so the first thing that will come out

739
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:06,252
will be the summer collection,

740
00:26:06,252 --> 00:26:07,710
and then after will be the Pride collection,

741
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:09,540
even though it's not Pride Month.

742
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,330
One thing that I do want to tell you guys is that

743
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:12,990
I was planning on donating a huge chunk

744
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:15,620
of the Pride Month proceeds to The Trevor Project,

745
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,733
just like Morphe did with their Pride collection.

746
00:26:17,733 --> 00:26:19,860
When it does launch, I will still be donating

747
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,730
a huge chunk of the proceeds to The Trevor Project.

748
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:23,850
Just obviously, a little bit later on.

749
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:26,110
Since however, the donation wasn't able to be made right

750
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:28,360
now, I do want to do something special for Pride Month,

751
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,030
so I've decided to donate all proceeds from this video

752
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:32,860
on AdSense directly to The Trevor Project,

753
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:35,440
so we'll add those together, and I will keep you guys posted

754
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,680
with how much we were able to raise for the foundation

755
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,030
when the Pride Month collection launches later, so.

756
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,050
Lots of fun things.

757
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:43,390
All right you guys, this has been a very,

758
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:45,500
very long video to film, but I had so much fun,

759
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,150
and I really hope you guys did as well.

760
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:49,330
I love you so, so, so much, Happy Pride,

761
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:52,029
and I will see you on the next one, bye, Sisters!
