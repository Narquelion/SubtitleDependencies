- Hi sisters, James Charles here

6
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:13,900
and welcome back to my YouTube channel.

7
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:14,950
Now if you'll notice,

8
00:00:15,845 --> 00:00:16,870
we are not exactly in our normal filming location.

9
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:18,620
I am currently at my front door

10
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,210
and that is because for today's brand new video

11
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,070
we are doing the one thing you guys have been requesting

12
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,450
for a literal months,

13
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:26,810
and that is the finished house tour.

14
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28,100
Now if you guys have not yet seen my video

15
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,610
from Tuesday, make sure to click right up here

16
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:33,040
because I teamed up with literally one of my favorite

17
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,930
YouTubers of all time, Mr. Kate,

18
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,570
and we decorated my entire house.

19
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:40,130
Now in case you missed it, I moved into a beautiful big

20
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:42,110
house about four months ago now

21
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,720
and my life has changed so much for the better.

22
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,897
Myself, my little brother, my friends

23
00:00:45,897 --> 00:00:48,150
and my family are all able to come over here,

24
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:50,570
relax, get some work done, and just feel so at home

25
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,656
and I literally am so beyond excited

26
00:00:52,656 --> 00:00:54,590
to finally have it fully decorated

27
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,190
and looking so incredibly beautiful.

28
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,280
And this home would definitely not be possible

29
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,450
if not for you guys.

30
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:02,293
So like I promised at the end of last video,

31
00:01:02,293 --> 00:01:05,147
welcome to my finished house tour.

32
00:01:05,147 --> 00:01:07,980
(uplifting music)

33
00:01:12,246 --> 00:01:13,150
- [Drew] Wait twist around, let's make sure

34
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,707
your foundation matches, for a real one.

35
00:01:15,707 --> 00:01:17,373
- Does it? - [Drew] Yeah it looks good.

36
00:01:17,373 --> 00:01:18,749
I just wanted to make sure. - Okay.

37
00:01:18,749 --> 00:01:20,700
- [Drew] 'Cause this is where you got caught last time.

38
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,840
- That's so true.

39
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,620
So walking into the front door of the sister sanctuary,

40
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,180
we have a big open kind of like formal foyer

41
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,574
which I really, really love.

42
00:01:29,574 --> 00:01:31,140
You can basically open the front door

43
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,760
and see all the way out to the back yard

44
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,830
which is like probably my favorite part of the entire house.

45
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,370
Obviously we're gonna walk all the way through it,

46
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:37,810
but I just love the open floor plan,

47
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:40,020
it makes everything feel so connected.

48
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,640
On the first wall of the house, we put a beautiful

49
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,240
huge kinda circle mirror.

50
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,840
So when you walk in, you can check yourself,

51
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,870
make sure you look beautiful.

52
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,130
Or if you're heading out for the day,

53
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:49,305
you can quickly pop right back into the mirror

54
00:01:49,305 --> 00:01:51,120
and see if you still look sister snatched,

55
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,600
which of course, we do.

56
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,040
It is my job.

57
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,920
But as you can see in the background of this mirror

58
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,277
is the first room of the house,

59
00:01:57,277 --> 00:01:59,070
the first thing that you see when you walk in.

60
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,271
And it is this beautiful formal living room

61
00:02:02,271 --> 00:02:06,050
that was actually completely style by Mr. Kate and Joey.

62
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:07,920
This was like the surprise room that they do

63
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,216
for their little series, Oh My God We're Coming Over!

64
00:02:10,216 --> 00:02:12,466
Favorite series literally in the entire world

65
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:14,875
here on YouTube.

66
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:15,810
But, they basically locked off this entire room

67
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,580
and decided to sister style it for me.

68
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,480
When I first moved in it and started decorating the house,

69
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,410
this was literally the only room that I had

70
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,860
absolutely no idea what to do with it.

71
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,487
I know I kinda wanted it to be like a formal living space

72
00:02:25,487 --> 00:02:27,310
for when you first walk in,

73
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,669
'cause I feel like that's how a lot of houses are I guess.

74
00:02:29,669 --> 00:02:32,140
But I wanted to give it to the hands

75
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,040
of Kate and Joey who I absolutely trusted,

76
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,820
and I trusted them for the right reason

77
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,713
because this room literally looks so beyond beautiful.

78
00:02:38,713 --> 00:02:41,010
I feel like it is the perfect entry way

79
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,740
into the sister sanctuary.

80
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,580
So if you guys wanna check out the full transformation,

81
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,080
make sure you go check out the video on their channel.

82
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,640
I'm gonna link it down below, I absolutely love them.

83
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,675
But if we do a quick little walk through,

84
00:02:49,675 --> 00:02:52,310
we have a beautiful little chaise lounge

85
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,410
right here to just take your shoes off

86
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:57,200
and relax after a long day of work.

87
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,040
We also have a little table with a sister safety pin.

88
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,160
Because the earing that I always wear

89
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,490
I thought that was such a cute little detail.

90
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,588
We have a fireplace to keep warm because it does get

91
00:03:05,588 --> 00:03:07,729
a little chilly here in the California nights.

92
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:10,520
This beautiful piece of artwork that Kate and I did together

93
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,020
is a little DIY project.

94
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:15,600
And of course this beautiful, brand new, shiny black

95
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,700
baby grand piano.

96
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,570
Oh my god you guys, I am absolutely obsessed with this.

97
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:21,340
This was actually gifted to me in secrecy

98
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,650
by Linda Morphe, the founder of Morphe.

99
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:26,511
As you guys know I did my palette with them

100
00:03:26,511 --> 00:03:27,960
and this just means literally the entire world to me.

101
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,500
As you guys know I do have such a huge passion for music

102
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,600
and playing the piano.

103
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,460
I of course have the one upstairs as well

104
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,370
which we'll get into later.

105
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:36,610
But working with the Morphe team on my palette collaboration

106
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,710
has been literally like a dream come true

107
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,380
and I'm so grateful to every single one of them

108
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,420
and the fact that they wanted to go out of their way

109
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,250
to buy me such a beautiful and timeless gift

110
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,800
that I can play every single day,

111
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,633
like means the entire world to me.

112
00:03:46,633 --> 00:03:49,300
Now that's pretty much the formal living room all complete.

113
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,050
Like I said, if you guys want full details,

114
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,290
head over to Mr. Kate's channel.

115
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,150
But if we move onto the next room now,

116
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,230
we have the dining room (laughs),

117
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:00,100
which I'm so beyond excited to actually have in this house.

118
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,180
Obviously the center of this room is this huge table

119
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,200
that we got from Ikea.

120
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,660
I really, really like this table because it's so large

121
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,970
and big and can fit so many people.

122
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:09,803
When we first moved in,

123
00:04:09,803 --> 00:04:11,270
I really thought I was gonna keep this

124
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:13,020
because of the fact that the color of this wood

125
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,859
is so similar to the color of the wood floors,

126
00:04:14,859 --> 00:04:16,958
but Mr. Kate suggested that we get a really cute carpet

127
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,200
to kind of separate the two

128
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,040
and I really, really like how it turned out.

129
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,102
We also got a farmhouse style dining chair set

130
00:04:23,102 --> 00:04:25,330
from Living Spaces which I really, really like

131
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,590
how it pulled it all together

132
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,714
and of course, a black bench over there as well.

133
00:04:28,714 --> 00:04:31,490
For some more sister seating if we have a lot of people

134
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:33,080
to kind od squeeze in.

135
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,150
I honestly cannot remember where this light is from

136
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,090
but I do know that it way cuter

137
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,280
than the one that was there before,

138
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,560
so I'm very, very excited on this little switch out.

139
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,210
I think it really brought the whole room together,

140
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,730
again kind of continues the whole

141
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,923
modern contemporary farmhouse vibe that we have going on.

142
00:04:45,923 --> 00:04:47,530
So that is pretty much the dining room,

143
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,380
where all of our family dinners happen.

144
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,710
Like I said, so excited to finally have a space

145
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:54,789
to all just enjoy and relax and eat really delicious food.

146
00:04:54,789 --> 00:04:56,270
Moving onto the next room.

147
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,140
As you might see, we have this really large

148
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,520
open entrance area, which I absolutely love.

149
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,570
The ceilings of this house are so high up

150
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:03,900
and because of the fact that we have these

151
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,420
railings and balcony up here,

152
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:08,496
I can sing for real and it echoes around the house.

153
00:05:08,496 --> 00:05:11,302
One of my favorite past times when I'm not working

154
00:05:11,302 --> 00:05:12,851
all day long (laughs).

155
00:05:12,851 --> 00:05:15,269
So we if we actually take a little bit of a step backwards,

156
00:05:15,269 --> 00:05:17,170
this is what is called a mudroom,

157
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,840
which is apparently not that common

158
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,545
in California houses for some reason.

159
00:05:20,545 --> 00:05:22,510
The house that I grew up in upstate New York

160
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,502
with my Mom and Dad and brother, obviously,

161
00:05:24,502 --> 00:05:26,921
didn't have an entire room dedicated to being a mudroom,

162
00:05:26,921 --> 00:05:30,090
where we just left our shoes and coats and jackets

163
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:31,770
and for some reason, just having this here

164
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,010
still very, very nostalgic

165
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:35,350
and it's like a piece of home back here.

166
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,150
I don't know why, this area's just like kind of

167
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,490
weirdly special to me,

168
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,430
even though we literally just take our shoes off here,

169
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,700
but it's the first thing you see

170
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,600
when you're coming from the garage and that's the mudroom.

171
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,150
And then next door to the mudroom

172
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:49,210
is the sisters office.

173
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:51,296
Now, this is definitely like the one room of the house

174
00:05:51,296 --> 00:05:53,556
that is still a little bit under construction,

175
00:05:53,556 --> 00:05:56,350
'cause recently my manager just quit his firm

176
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:58,170
and now works for me full-time only,

177
00:05:58,170 --> 00:05:59,387
which is really fun, really fresh.

178
00:05:59,387 --> 00:06:01,083
We get so much work done

179
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,510
and I am so blessed to have him in my life.

180
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:05,220
We just hired an incredible new assistant as well

181
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,150
and also, my editor is in the process

182
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,170
of moving out here to L.A. very, very soon,

183
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:11,210
so we can work even hard on my videos

184
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:12,140
and get them done faster,

185
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,730
which is going to be such a huge weight

186
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:15,410
off of mine and his shoulders.

187
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:17,620
So, we tried to make the office look as cute as we could

188
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,580
for the sake of this video,

189
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,690
but it's probably going to be changing

190
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:21,678
a lot within the next few weeks.

191
00:06:21,678 --> 00:06:22,670
I will of course update you guys on Snapchat

192
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,380
and as well, I kind of want to do a

193
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,360
behind the scenes production type video later on.

194
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,490
So of course, if that video goes up,

195
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:30,290
you will see the finished office

196
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,930
with my editor kind of walking you guys through it.

197
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:34,903
But regardless, here we are. So the first thing you see

198
00:06:34,903 --> 00:06:35,940
when you walk right into this room

199
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,170
is this huge sister neon sign,

200
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:39,490
which is probably blown out on camera,

201
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:40,910
I'll make sure to inset a little overlay

202
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,735
so you can see actually how good it is.

203
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,037
But I am absolutely obsessed with this.

204
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:47,880
Obviously you guys know that sisters is like my entire brand

205
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,010
and this is the logo that we have

206
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:50,480
on all the sisters apparel pieces,

207
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,870
which is my clothing line.

208
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:52,990
And because the fact that these windows

209
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,260
are facing away from the sun,

210
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,689
there's not a lot of natural light in this room at all,

211
00:06:55,689 --> 00:06:57,330
and the last thing that I want

212
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,640
is everybody to be working in here kind of dull and dreary

213
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,240
and like falling asleep during the day.

214
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,970
So this is a beautiful light source

215
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:04,600
to kind of brighten the mood.

216
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,333
Along these two walls,

217
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:07,166
we just have a cute little L shaped desk

218
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:08,570
to sit and get work done.

219
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:10,610
I custom made this out of different Ikea pieces.

220
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,160
Of course, we have the iconic ALEX drawers

221
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,690
that literally every single beauty guru

222
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,570
and their mother has in their house.

223
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:17,240
They really are so convenient to use

224
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,371
and also these two table tops with the legs below as well.

225
00:07:19,371 --> 00:07:23,030
Above the iMac, we have these two floating shelves,

226
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,637
which Mr.Kate also picked up from Ikea.

227
00:07:24,637 --> 00:07:27,220
I really like how these look in the room

228
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,355
and it's just a really cool way

229
00:07:29,355 --> 00:07:31,100
to just kind of store a few extra pieces and storage items.

230
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,687
I keep some important files and different stuff

231
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:35,870
in these boxes and we also have some cool achievements here

232
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:38,910
like my People's Choice Award and the Shorty Award as well,

233
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:41,580
which by the way, a really good plug here,

234
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,080
a perfect promo opportunity,

235
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,229
we're actually nominated for

236
00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:46,497
YouTuber of the Year in the Shorty Awards this year,

237
00:07:46,497 --> 00:07:48,001
which is so incredibly cool.

238
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:51,110
Last year we did win Breakout YouTuber of the Year,

239
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,670
which is already such a huge honor,

240
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:54,460
but I think we did this when we had

241
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,534
two or three million subscribers.

242
00:07:56,534 --> 00:07:58,810
Now we're at a good and fresh 14 million.

243
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:00,490
So I feel like YouTuber of the Year

244
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:02,670
is such an incredible and huge honor.

245
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:03,720
If you guys want to vote for me,

246
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,270
it would mean so, so, so much.

247
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,980
You can vote every single day and I'll leave the link

248
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,800
in the description box down below.

249
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,030
You guys continue to surprise me every single day

250
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,800
and how much love and support you've given me.

251
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,690
And we're one of the fastest growing families

252
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:16,010
literally on the entire platform,

253
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:17,740
so I feel like we've got this in the bag.

254
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,010
So if you guys want to go vote,

255
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:21,380
vote for me for YouTuber of the Year at the Shorty Awards.

256
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,680
And also vote for my best friend, Drew,

257
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,700
Lone Fox in the house and home category.

258
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,133
You're welcome for that.

259
00:08:26,133 --> 00:08:27,200
(laughing)

260
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,280
Final touches of the room,

261
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,857
we do have these black rolling chairs

262
00:08:30,857 --> 00:08:31,860
for my film editor to sit at.

263
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,700
But we also have these super cute little

264
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,247
kind of hairpin stools as well.

265
00:08:35,247 --> 00:08:37,310
Just so we can kind of sister spin around

266
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:38,480
for a real one in here

267
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,700
and a lot of the meetings we do have are held in this room,

268
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,690
so it's really good to have extra seating area

269
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:44,480
in case you have extra guests, for my lawyer

270
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,294
or my assistant or somebody joining us.

271
00:08:46,294 --> 00:08:48,350
And then finally, last but not least,

272
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,610
on this wall, we have this TV screen

273
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,267
that is live broadcasting our calendar.

274
00:08:52,267 --> 00:08:54,760
I've been wanting to do this for a very, very long time.

275
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,570
I'm someone who lives my entire life by my calendar.

276
00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:00,380
I have to know what is going on at all times of the day.

277
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,810
Super good to be able to walk right into the office

278
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,770
and look at the screen and see what's going on,

279
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,770
what I need to do, what time I need to wake up,

280
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:07,790
who I need to be on the phone with,

281
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,380
and what is going on later on in the day,

282
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,487
that I need to get ready for.

283
00:09:10,487 --> 00:09:12,910
And last but not least, as we head out of the office,

284
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:15,260
we have a poster with my favorite quote in the entire world,

285
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,890
work smarter, not harder.

286
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,528
A quote to live by sisters.

287
00:09:19,528 --> 00:09:21,710
Here is the wine cellar which unfortunately

288
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,130
is still not filled up.

289
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,926
You guys so I am a sober sister and do not drink.

290
00:09:24,926 --> 00:09:27,292
I really want to fill this with Mexican coke bottles

291
00:09:27,292 --> 00:09:29,330
because they're so cute and so vintage

292
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:32,767
and I also have a little bit of severe addiction to them.

293
00:09:32,767 --> 00:09:35,110
But I cannot find a bottle that is actually big enough

294
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,950
that doesn't fall through these things.

295
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:39,550
If you have any suggestions, please let a sister know

296
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,970
because this is looking very empty and sad.

297
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:45,680
Regardless, let's move into the kitchen and living room.

298
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,750
Even though I personally do not do any cooking,

299
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,000
well I guess we do do a little bit of baking.

300
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,450
The kitchen is probably the room we spend the most time in

301
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:58,280
in this entire house and I love, love, love my kitchen.

302
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,420
Not a whole lot has changed since the empty house video

303
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,500
but I do love how we decorated it.

304
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,240
We just have a cute little vase, a lantern,

305
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,300
and a little plant and table,

306
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,731
and also a very conveniently opened issue of Vogue Australia

307
00:10:08,731 --> 00:10:11,833
thank you to my assistant for doing that (laughs).

308
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,473
There's me.

309
00:10:13,473 --> 00:10:15,680
We have this huge black planter behind the sink

310
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,330
we three different plants in it.

311
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:19,590
There is a huge beautiful bay window

312
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,370
that leads out into the backyard.

313
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,140
So this is a really cool way to kind of separate

314
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,815
the outside from the in with still like a living element,

315
00:10:25,815 --> 00:10:27,180
if that makes sense?

316
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,420
I just really like it.

317
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,550
We have this huge Viking professional fridge

318
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:31,740
and I though I would show you guys

319
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,630
since we are pretty much a fully sister stocked right now.

320
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,900
Love it, as you can tell, lots of a Red Bull,

321
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,330
I need a whole lot of energy while I am working all day long

322
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:40,610
and not getting any sleep.

323
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:43,033
Gatorade for Ian, lots of coke for the addiction.

324
00:10:43,033 --> 00:10:45,332
Fiji water so you can stay nice and hydrated,

325
00:10:45,332 --> 00:10:48,790
salsa, syrup for waffles in the morning,

326
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,702
lots of fruit, lots of apple slices,

327
00:10:50,702 --> 00:10:52,940
eggs, and my bits and bobs.

328
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,380
So once we've prepared our breakfast foods in the morning,

329
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,010
we head over to the breakfast nook,

330
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:58,433
which is right over here.

331
00:10:58,433 --> 00:11:01,000
It's a simple round table that I got from Ikea

332
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,869
and just four of the iconic white IMS chairs.

333
00:11:02,869 --> 00:11:04,730
I really like these chairs for some reason.

334
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,620
I got them because literally every single

335
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,483
interior designer ever uses these on Pinterest boards

336
00:11:08,483 --> 00:11:09,950
that I was following when I wanted to

337
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:11,380
decorate my first apartment,

338
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,340
I just kept them ever since.

339
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,391
Did I just do a chair review?

340
00:11:14,391 --> 00:11:16,288
4.5 out of 5, would recommend.

341
00:11:16,288 --> 00:11:19,020
I have a little tray on the table from CB2

342
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,965
and also this plant I got from HomeGoods.

343
00:11:20,965 --> 00:11:23,610
Mr. Kate and I just replaced the old light that was here

344
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:28,100
with this insanely gorgeous super black pendant light.

345
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,690
It was gross and white and crusty before

346
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:30,950
and I think this just ties together

347
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:33,396
the space so incredibly well, I just love how it looks.

348
00:11:33,396 --> 00:11:34,900
Behind the breakfast window,

349
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,430
there is this huge bay window that leads out

350
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,740
to the backyard area, which I'll get to in a second.

351
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,190
Mr. Kate and I decided to add some curtains to the area

352
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:43,560
just to kind of add a more homey and comfortable vibe

353
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,600
when you're eating breakfast.

354
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,350
But I love how this window lets so much natural light in

355
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:49,553
and like I said, when you walk in the front door,

356
00:11:49,553 --> 00:11:53,090
you can literally see through the entire rest of the house.

357
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:54,960
I feel like it just brings the whole house together.

358
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,880
And last but finally not least,

359
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,970
on the wall, we just have some typography posters

360
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,390
that I custom made in photoshop

361
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,025
and got printed over at Staples.

362
00:12:01,025 --> 00:12:03,140
We have this, good and fresh,

363
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,300
for when you're eating your breakfast foods

364
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,140
and it's just so good and fresh

365
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,830
and then also this one from Andy Warhol

366
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:10,367
at Morderna Museet in Sweden, I like boring things.

367
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:13,080
Flowing right from the breakfast nook and outside,

368
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,910
we have the living room,

369
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,607
which is once again, similar to the kitchen.

370
00:12:16,607 --> 00:12:19,296
Me and my family spend a whole lot of time in

371
00:12:19,296 --> 00:12:21,300
and this is by far one of my favorite rooms

372
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,590
of the entire house.

373
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,820
I am obsessed with how this room came out.

374
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,118
I think it just pulled together so, so, so well.

375
00:12:27,118 --> 00:12:28,870
Obviously the biggest piece of this room

376
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:31,300
is the huge L shaped sofa.

377
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,330
This is literally the most comfortable couch

378
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:34,610
in the entire world

379
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:36,840
and I've gotten so many questions asking what this couch is

380
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,160
and it is actually not the cloud couch,

381
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,247
which is like the couch that every single person ever buys.

382
00:12:41,247 --> 00:12:43,850
They're literally $20,000

383
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,440
which is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard

384
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,380
in my entire life.

385
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,000
This one I actually got from Living Spaces

386
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,510
and it is the same exact thing,

387
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:51,298
but it was a fifth of the price

388
00:12:51,298 --> 00:12:53,270
and it was actually being discontinued

389
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,700
which leaves me to believe that

390
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,820
they may have been getting sued for copying.

391
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,034
Not my problem, it is now here and we get to enjoy it.

392
00:13:00,034 --> 00:13:01,660
On the couch, we just have some

393
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,920
different textures of pillows

394
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,688
from Target, HomeGoods, Ikea, CB2 as well.

395
00:13:06,688 --> 00:13:10,570
And then in the middle, we have this gorgeous coffee table

396
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:12,540
that I am obsessed with.

397
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,820
Before we actually redecorated,

398
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,420
there was a clear acrylic one here,

399
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,366
which I really liked too,

400
00:13:17,366 --> 00:13:18,330
but we ended up moving it upstairs

401
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,370
because the fact the couch is so big,

402
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:22,380
we really needed a bit of a bigger coffee table

403
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,130
to kind of anchor the whole room together.

404
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:25,601
That was Mr. Kate's suggestion

405
00:13:25,601 --> 00:13:27,336
and I literally agree and I am so obsessed with this

406
00:13:27,336 --> 00:13:30,230
concrete and glass asymmetrical moment

407
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:31,603
that we have going on.

408
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,353
On top of the table is just a few

409
00:13:33,353 --> 00:13:35,210
different coffee table books.

410
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:36,639
We have Chanel, Louis Vuitton,

411
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,920
and also the new Balenciaga collection as well,

412
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,019
and just a super simple vase with fake plants in it

413
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:43,305
because I can't keep a real plant alive to save my life.

414
00:13:43,305 --> 00:13:44,990
Below the coffee table and couch,

415
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,660
we have a good and fresh Jute rug

416
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,920
that Kate actually picked out.

417
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,520
Now, if you guys remember in Tuesday's video,

418
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,300
we were actually having a little bit of a dilemma

419
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,760
when it came to this rug.

420
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,300
When the installation was first starting,

421
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,470
I was really, really scared because it had been

422
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,291
raining all week in L.A. and this carpet was looking

423
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:02,350
very, very yellow, which is my biggest design no no.

424
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,900
I hate tan, I hate yellow,

425
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,640
but Kate convinced me to just wait it out

426
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,170
and see how it all looked in the end.

427
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:08,250
And now that the natural daylight

428
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,570
is kind of floating in here

429
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:11,520
and illuminating the room,

430
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,000
I actually really, really like how the colors

431
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,110
of this rug turned out

432
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:16,107
and I think it adds a beautiful texture to the room.

433
00:14:16,107 --> 00:14:18,240
Should have listened to her from the beginning,

434
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,210
but it does go to show that the design process

435
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:22,190
is never perfect and sometimes you have to wait

436
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:24,310
until the end to see the full picture.

437
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:25,730
Speaking of pictures as well,

438
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:27,513
we also have three prints here on this wall.

439
00:14:27,513 --> 00:14:30,580
We have another Andy Warhol one right there,

440
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,770
another typography one that says good things take time

441
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:35,132
on the right and then in the middle

442
00:14:35,132 --> 00:14:36,160
is this huge photograph that I actually took

443
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,337
when I was on my trip to South Africa last year.

444
00:14:38,337 --> 00:14:40,530
This is an iPhone photo that we got printed

445
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:42,094
on canvas and framed and I just think it looks so sunny

446
00:14:42,094 --> 00:14:45,120
and it's a really nice break as well

447
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,650
from the typography that you guys see

448
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,080
going on a lot in the house.

449
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,600
Behind me on this wall, we have of course,

450
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,210
the entertainment wall.

451
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:53,000
There's a huge TV that we got from Costco

452
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,070
right here on the wall.

453
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:56,260
I'm not even sure how many inches that is,

454
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,000
oh, I love that sentence.

455
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,230
Under the TV, we have a few different decor pieces,

456
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:02,217
some books, and also some and Xbox controllers

457
00:15:02,217 --> 00:15:05,005
for gaming during the day.

458
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:07,250
Then we have two black massive

459
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,010
shelving units on either side.

460
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,550
I was very, very skeptical about these

461
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:12,590
shelving units when I first kind of moved in here

462
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:14,640
because I feel like they are very, very dark,

463
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,970
but we just finished decorating them

464
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:17,470
and putting all these different pieces on there

465
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:21,340
from CB2, HomeGoods, Target, Ikea as well,

466
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,465
and I really, really like how the shelves

467
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:25,650
ended up looking fully styled.

468
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,110
We tried to pick a lot of bright items

469
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:28,780
such as different white decors pieces

470
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,110
and also plants as well,

471
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:31,660
to brighten everything up from the black

472
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:34,720
and I'm obsessed with how the styling looks.

473
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,660
And last but finally not least,

474
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,793
we have this massive love sack right here,

475
00:15:37,793 --> 00:15:39,680
that we just sit and chill on

476
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,076
and I threw a blanket and pillow over top.

477
00:15:42,076 --> 00:15:44,129
And I think that's pretty much the living room all complete.

478
00:15:44,129 --> 00:15:46,610
That is pretty much where we spend

479
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:48,240
most of our time during the day.

480
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,440
Let's head upstairs and I'll show you guys

481
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,024
where we spend most of our time at night.

482
00:15:51,024 --> 00:15:52,802
Now we start heading upstairs,

483
00:15:52,802 --> 00:15:55,397
all the light comes shining in

484
00:15:55,397 --> 00:15:56,870
and the lighting should look really good

485
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:58,400
and beautiful and fresh.

486
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,195
This is literally some of my favorite areas

487
00:16:00,195 --> 00:16:01,610
of the entire house because of how bright it is

488
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:04,217
and how alive this whole area feels.

489
00:16:04,217 --> 00:16:06,190
When you first get to the top of the landing,

490
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:07,610
this is the first wall that you see

491
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:09,726
and I just decided to put two more typography photos up here

492
00:16:09,726 --> 00:16:12,180
we have this one saying be yourself

493
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,700
and this one, once again from Andy Warhol,

494
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,090
saying all is pretty.

495
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:16,310
Me.

496
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,690
Along this entire wall is just more shelving units,

497
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:20,040
just like the downstairs.

498
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,740
I wasn't exactly sure what to do with these

499
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,723
but we did decide to turn this awkward height

500
00:16:23,723 --> 00:16:25,826
little shelves into kind of benches

501
00:16:25,826 --> 00:16:27,820
which I think is so, so, so cute

502
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,340
and they're really comfortable.

503
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,757
We just got some sheep skin rugs from Ikea

504
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:33,535
and some more pillows from CB2 and Target

505
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,380
and then this little area right here

506
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,600
is where I get to take all my selfies during the day

507
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,440
because if you come this way, right here,

508
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,732
oh sun's right there.

509
00:16:41,732 --> 00:16:44,258
It's a little bit early still to be taking

510
00:16:44,258 --> 00:16:45,690
my golden hour selfies,

511
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:48,000
but at this angle, so good.

512
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,522
If we just keep walking this way,

513
00:16:49,522 --> 00:16:50,980
we have this cute little desk area right here.

514
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,017
Once again, more decor pieces.

515
00:16:53,017 --> 00:16:54,580
We have the original

516
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,220
James Charles 100,000 subscribers plaque.

517
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,520
So cool how far we've come

518
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,696
and we'll be getting to that in one quick second.

519
00:16:59,696 --> 00:17:01,640
And I've just this little desk area

520
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,288
that we filled with some

521
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:04,270
different color pencils and Sharpies,

522
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,670
of course, some sister scissors

523
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,730
if we're getting any crafting or work done.

524
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:08,920
And usually my assistant will just leave

525
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,150
his laptop right here during the day.

526
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:13,050
This first door right here is the guest room

527
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:14,310
for friends and family,

528
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,820
where different people will stay.

529
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:18,143
I am obsessed with this room.

530
00:17:18,143 --> 00:17:19,975
Just like how Mr. Kate did my front little living room,

531
00:17:19,975 --> 00:17:22,310
my best friend Drew actually did the same thing

532
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,970
but in this guest room.

533
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:25,680
Over on his channel, Lone Fox Home,

534
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,070
I think he did an incredible job styling it.

535
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:29,210
So if you guys want to see how we turned

536
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:30,650
a tiny, little, drab room into

537
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,973
such a fabulous guest room, I'll leave the link down in

538
00:17:32,973 --> 00:17:34,440
the description box down below as well.

539
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,336
But I'll give you guys a quick little overview.

540
00:17:36,336 --> 00:17:39,296
We have a massive California king sized bed right here,

541
00:17:39,296 --> 00:17:40,992
smack dab in the middle,

542
00:17:40,992 --> 00:17:44,092
and we decided to go for a kind of more darker gray sheet

543
00:17:44,092 --> 00:17:46,510
just because kind of all the bedding in the house

544
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:47,520
is so white and bright.

545
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,840
So we thought this would be a really good contrasting piece

546
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,311
and I really like how Drew actually styled it.

547
00:17:51,311 --> 00:17:53,510
We just have some more dark gray

548
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:55,330
and different textured pillows.

549
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:56,616
This braided one is from CB2,

550
00:17:56,616 --> 00:17:58,090
this one's from Target,

551
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:00,290
and I think these ones are just from HomeGoods.

552
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:02,670
This adorable hanging mirror is actually a DIY project

553
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:04,030
that Drew made out of an old belt

554
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:05,820
and an Ikea tray over on his channel.

555
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,230
I love how this looks above the bed.

556
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:08,860
It is so frickin' dope.

557
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,723
Next to the bed, we just have those side tables from Ikea

558
00:18:10,723 --> 00:18:12,432
and then over here, we just have this kind of

559
00:18:12,432 --> 00:18:15,640
strangely shaped shelf from Living Spaces.

560
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,100
I really was not convinced on this one

561
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,100
when Drew first showed it to me,

562
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,210
but I think in the room with everything styled

563
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:22,390
and on top of it, it looks so good.

564
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:23,430
And last but finally not least,

565
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:26,100
we have this huge Ikea mirror right here.

566
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,060
I'm obsessed with these,

567
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,267
I think it was like the STAVE mirror, it was called.

568
00:18:29,267 --> 00:18:31,970
And it's just large so you can take your OOTDs,

569
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:34,525
check your outfit, check your makeup before you head out

570
00:18:34,525 --> 00:18:37,400
and that is the guest room all complete.

571
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,811
Now heading out of the guest room,

572
00:18:38,811 --> 00:18:40,160
we're going to head into probably my favorite room

573
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,566
of the entire house.

574
00:18:41,566 --> 00:18:43,196
It's where I get all my work done, the sister studio.

575
00:18:43,196 --> 00:18:45,410
But quickly before we head into there,

576
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:46,420
I do want to show you guys something

577
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:48,580
that I am very, very proud of. As you may or may not know,

578
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:51,007
us YouTubers, when we hit certain subscriber milestones,

579
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,828
we get these things called plaques from YouTube.

580
00:18:52,828 --> 00:18:54,061
This was one of my biggest achievements

581
00:18:54,061 --> 00:18:56,090
and I was so excited to get this

582
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:57,420
in the mail for the first time,

583
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,482
but it has been about two years now

584
00:18:59,482 --> 00:19:01,510
since we had a 100,000 subscribers

585
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:05,309
and the family has grown just a little bit at least,

586
00:19:05,309 --> 00:19:08,150
to a good and fresh about 14 million,

587
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:10,270
which I cannot thank you guys enough for.

588
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:12,380
I am so blessed to have you guys watching and supporting me

589
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,108
and I kind of wanted to showcase that in the house

590
00:19:14,108 --> 00:19:15,760
in a very, very special way.

591
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,210
So after 100,000, the next big milestone

592
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:19,657
you get a plaque for is one million

593
00:19:19,657 --> 00:19:22,960
and it came with this little gold pipe on right here.

594
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,600
But it was actually a dark gray background,

595
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,280
so I decided to get this all reframed

596
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,837
so it's nice and bright and white.

597
00:19:27,837 --> 00:19:30,060
Very matching with the whole aesthetic.

598
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,566
But after the 1 million plaque comes the 10 million plaque

599
00:19:32,566 --> 00:19:34,870
and that is proudly displayed right here.

600
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:37,170
I had an amazing and lovely dinner

601
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,774
with a few of the YouTube executives a few weeks ago

602
00:19:38,774 --> 00:19:41,360
and they actually gifted this to me live in person,

603
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,509
which was such a cool and honorary moment.

604
00:19:43,509 --> 00:19:45,120
But when you get the 10 million plaque,

605
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,630
it actually just comes like this, it's like a trophy.

606
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:49,140
But I thought it'd be really cool to get it framed

607
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,240
in the same exact shadow box

608
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,720
that I was doing the one million in,

609
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,465
so now they are matching and looking so cute

610
00:19:53,465 --> 00:19:55,210
right next to each other on the wall

611
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:58,230
and it's quite the glow up.

612
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,534
Speaking of the sisterhood growing

613
00:19:59,534 --> 00:20:00,700
and a little bit of a glow up,

614
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,620
if we head this way around the corner,

615
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,330
we get to the best room of the entire house,

616
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:06,340
the sister studio.

617
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,401
And if you're wondering, this door right here

618
00:20:08,401 --> 00:20:10,024
leads to Ian's room.

619
00:20:10,024 --> 00:20:10,980
It is not exactly aesthetically pleasing

620
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,090
to this whole video,

621
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:14,600
so I'm sure he'll do a room tour at some other point.

622
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,760
You can watch his video for that,

623
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,496
but this door right here leads to

624
00:20:17,496 --> 00:20:21,610
the sister studio, come on in.

625
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:23,870
As soon as I got confirmation that I moving into this house,

626
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,809
this room was literally the first project that I worked on

627
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:28,576
because I have always dreamt of having a room

628
00:20:28,576 --> 00:20:29,480
where I can get everything done,

629
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,083
have friends and guests over and film comfortably.

630
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:32,906
A room where my manager, assistant, videographer,

631
00:20:32,906 --> 00:20:34,787
editor, writer can all be in

632
00:20:34,787 --> 00:20:36,440
and it won't feel cramped

633
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:40,083
and this room is exactly that. In the middle of this room,

634
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:43,100
we have this brand new white dining table actually

635
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,878
which is my new filming desk.

636
00:20:44,878 --> 00:20:46,510
As you guys remember, in my old one I had

637
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:49,650
a tiny little Ikea desk which was so inconvenient

638
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:50,483
to film in front of.

639
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:51,881
You have no idea.

640
00:20:51,881 --> 00:20:52,714
All my stuff would always fly off of it

641
00:20:52,714 --> 00:20:54,760
and it was impossible to film collabs in front of.

642
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,600
So I'm so glad that I have a massive space

643
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,760
to spread all of my makeup out on,

644
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,546
so I can just concentrate on the filming production process.

645
00:21:01,546 --> 00:21:03,190
I keep a mirror on my table,

646
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:05,094
a charger for my second phone that I take my selfies with

647
00:21:05,094 --> 00:21:07,620
and then I just keep my brushes displayed on here

648
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,170
as well for easy access.

649
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:10,810
The James Charles X Morphe palette is also

650
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:13,155
always here as well because it really

651
00:21:13,155 --> 00:21:14,180
the only palette I ever reach for.

652
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:17,260
Also, the iconic sisters fan is here too

653
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:19,110
because when you're filming in front of bright lights,

654
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:21,130
it definitely does get very, very hot.

655
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:22,557
Behind me, I just have this white hanging backdrop roll.

656
00:21:22,557 --> 00:21:25,530
This one's from the brand, Seamless.

657
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:27,400
You guys know my YouTube backgrounds are always white.

658
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,294
I don't know why, it's just very aesthetically pleasing.

659
00:21:29,294 --> 00:21:31,651
This bench right here, I believe, is from All Modern

660
00:21:31,651 --> 00:21:33,650
and it's really, really comfortable,

661
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:36,804
but we did order a different bench from the brand, Article,

662
00:21:36,804 --> 00:21:38,857
it was just on back order, so it's not yet here.

663
00:21:38,857 --> 00:21:40,490
When the new bench does come in,

664
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:42,110
I'm actually gonna put this bench

665
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:44,606
below the two typography posters in the hallway.

666
00:21:44,606 --> 00:21:46,420
Apparently there's a chair here.

667
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:47,681
Right now I'm really not sure why.

668
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:49,791
Over on this wall,

669
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:53,502
we have the iconic sisters bench that was custom made

670
00:21:53,502 --> 00:21:56,730
for me by my best friend Ethan Dolan.

671
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:58,310
He got this for my Christmas gift

672
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:00,119
and I'm so grateful for it.

673
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:01,270
It is so comfortable and chic.

674
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:03,160
It is a beautiful black cushion bench

675
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,090
with a sisters cut out in the front

676
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,780
and it does have LED lights inside as well,

677
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:09,030
so the sisters is glowing which is so cool.

678
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:11,183
Right here, I just have my brand new pro photo D2 light

679
00:22:11,183 --> 00:22:13,670
and also this beauty dish right here.

680
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:14,990
I got this for myself as a Christmas gift this year

681
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:17,310
and I am so beyond excited because I feel like

682
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:20,040
my video quality is like the best it can possibly be,

683
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,630
but my photography game definitely has a long way to go

684
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:24,261
and I'm very, very excited to learn and use

685
00:22:24,261 --> 00:22:25,930
literally the best equipment.

686
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:27,600
So that is chilling right here

687
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,003
until I kind of wheel it out to wherever I'm taking photos.

688
00:22:30,003 --> 00:22:32,090
There's a simple bathroom right here

689
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:34,530
that my guests or I can use the bathroom while filming

690
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:37,062
or of course when I do in the sink as well.

691
00:22:37,062 --> 00:22:40,690
I got these two super amazing black directors chairs

692
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:42,452
from Amazon so my assistant or manager or writer

693
00:22:42,452 --> 00:22:46,270
or myself can sit back here and feel very, very professional

694
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:48,296
like we're in an actual sister studio.

695
00:22:48,296 --> 00:22:50,750
And then speaking of sister studios,

696
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:54,280
is this beautiful, insanely large acrylic sign

697
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,340
that Mr. Kate and I actually got from

698
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,070
Sign Makers here in L.A.

699
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,920
They custom laser cut all of this together

700
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,450
after I designed it on photoshop

701
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:02,958
and I just think it turned out so, so dope.

702
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:05,250
I think it is such a cool piece

703
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,060
to kind of anchor the whole room together

704
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:09,361
and remind everybody where they are.

705
00:23:09,361 --> 00:23:10,870
They're in the sister studios.

706
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:12,840
Now moving onto this wall, my makeup studio

707
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,780
would not exactly be a makeup studio without makeup in it

708
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:19,150
and that's what is inside these double closets right here.

709
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:20,067
Hallelujah.

710
00:23:21,529 --> 00:23:23,420
This is pretty much where I keep all the makeup products

711
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,870
that I use for my videos.

712
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,500
They're all organized into little

713
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,600
clear shoe acrylic organizers.

714
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,904
I got this technique from Desi Perkins,

715
00:23:29,904 --> 00:23:32,464
Down here, I just keep pretty much all the excess stuff.

716
00:23:32,464 --> 00:23:34,600
I definitely like to keep the boxes

717
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,190
of all the different equipment stuff that I buy

718
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,969
just in case something is not working or if something breaks

719
00:23:37,969 --> 00:23:39,939
I can read through the manual and figure out why

720
00:23:39,939 --> 00:23:41,540
and how to fix it.

721
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,189
Here I just keep the Morphe X James Charles PR box

722
00:23:43,189 --> 00:23:45,480
just to remind myself of what

723
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,500
an incredible collection we've created.

724
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,187
I usually keep extra cameras right up here

725
00:23:49,187 --> 00:23:51,200
but I'm filming on my extra camera today.

726
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,210
It would normally be right here.

727
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:54,240
And then at the very, very top,

728
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,470
I just keep all of my beautiful wigs,

729
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,790
so I can pick one out and just look stunning and beautiful

730
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:00,694
if I'm doing a drag look

731
00:24:00,694 --> 00:24:02,490
or just taking a fun Instagram picture

732
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:03,623
or hanging out with friends.

733
00:24:03,623 --> 00:24:04,456
Last but not least, probably the most important part

734
00:24:04,456 --> 00:24:06,254
of the sister studios,

735
00:24:06,254 --> 00:24:07,438
what makes everything happen

736
00:24:07,438 --> 00:24:08,290
is the different camera equipment that I have

737
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:09,920
and that is pretty much all right here

738
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,920
in the center of the room.

739
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,664
Now you may have noticed,

740
00:24:12,664 --> 00:24:13,497
pretty much the entire room is filled with this like

741
00:24:13,497 --> 00:24:15,340
strange metal cage and all these poles

742
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,490
going around the ceiling

743
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:18,470
and what this is for is basically so I can hang

744
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:20,315
all my different equipment pieces from the ceiling.

745
00:24:20,315 --> 00:24:23,402
And what that does is basically open up the entire room

746
00:24:23,402 --> 00:24:25,423
so people can actually walk around

747
00:24:25,423 --> 00:24:27,292
and not have these ugly stands literally

748
00:24:27,292 --> 00:24:29,970
taking up the entire floor space.

749
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:32,628
Now, I do really, really want to do a video

750
00:24:32,628 --> 00:24:34,780
documenting the behind the scenes process

751
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,657
of what actually takes to make a YouTube video.

752
00:24:36,657 --> 00:24:39,080
Everything from just thinking of a simple idea,

753
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,522
turning into a full on concept,

754
00:24:40,522 --> 00:24:42,380
actually sitting down and filming the video,

755
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,957
and then fully editing and getting ready to post.

756
00:24:43,957 --> 00:24:46,490
If that's something you guys would be interested in,

757
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:47,323
please let me know.

758
00:24:47,323 --> 00:24:48,690
I think it could be so cool

759
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:50,536
and if I was to do that video,

760
00:24:50,536 --> 00:24:51,866
I would kind of like to do a full equipment tour.

761
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:54,240
I've shown the different equipment and stuff that I have

762
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,387
on Snapchat a few times now

763
00:24:55,387 --> 00:24:56,700
and it seemed like a lot of you guys

764
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,860
are very, very interested in that.

765
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,370
So please let me know.

766
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:01,020
But to summarize here,

767
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,560
we have basically a diffusion sheet

768
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,240
that makes the light very, very soft.

769
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,660
I just got this brand new light panel

770
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,530
that hangs from the ceiling

771
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:08,610
and it's literally the brightest thing

772
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:10,180
in the entire world.

773
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,650
We have my massive camera and lens right here,

774
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:13,602
they sit on my tripod to get the perfect angle.

775
00:25:13,602 --> 00:25:16,390
My microphone is wired right here,

776
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:17,820
so I can make sure to turn it on

777
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:18,990
and never lose the audio

778
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:21,010
like has happened several times at this point

779
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:21,920
and to make sure of that,

780
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,100
we also have a pair of headphones

781
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,720
that sit right here as well,

782
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,245
so we can hear and make sure that it is on.

783
00:25:26,245 --> 00:25:27,924
Once the camera is on and rolling,

784
00:25:27,924 --> 00:25:29,930
I have this monitor right here

785
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:31,480
so anybody watching behind the scenes

786
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,300
can see exactly what is going on.

787
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,280
And then we also have one last monitor

788
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,530
that is in the front,

789
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:38,057
so I'm sitting behind the camera filming the video,

790
00:25:38,057 --> 00:25:43,057
I get to see exactly what you guys are seeing.

791
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:45,010
Hi sisters, James Charles here

792
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,970
and welcome back to my YouTube channel.

793
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:48,227
So yeah you guys, that is pretty much

794
00:25:48,227 --> 00:25:49,850
the sister studio all complete.

795
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:52,240
Like I said, let me know if you guys want

796
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,240
anymore in depth studio tour of all the equipment that I use

797
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,520
and the behind the scenes process

798
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,353
of making a youtube video.

799
00:25:57,353 --> 00:25:59,450
I bet that would be so much fun

800
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:00,660
and I would love to show you guys

801
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,700
what it actually looks like

802
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,020
and how much work goes into it

803
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,618
and also just let me nerd self come out

804
00:26:04,618 --> 00:26:06,903
and talk about the different equipment and technology.

805
00:26:06,903 --> 00:26:08,620
Let me know in the comments down below.

806
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,240
But without further ado,

807
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,820
let's head into the last and best room

808
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:16,170
of the entire house, the master bedroom.

809
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:17,599
Before we walk in, we have literally my favorite

810
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:19,735
thing that I own in the entire world.

811
00:26:19,735 --> 00:26:21,734
And that is my family photo.

812
00:26:21,734 --> 00:26:23,640
I did go ahead and post it on Instagram,

813
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,190
so you may have already seen this picture

814
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:26,670
and everybody inside of it.

815
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:28,520
But basically when I had my

816
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,170
Morphe X James Charles launch party,

817
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:32,041
it was my first time ever having my California family

818
00:26:32,041 --> 00:26:33,880
and my actual like birth family,

819
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,040
my Mom and my Dad that you guys have all met

820
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,400
in the room at the same time

821
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,730
and I hired my favorite photographer, Brandon Lundby,

822
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:41,360
who did all my campaign images,

823
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,960
to take a family photo.

824
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,500
Actually getting everybody to stand still

825
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,440
and smile for this photo

826
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,860
was probably one of the most difficult things

827
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,490
I've ever done in my entire life,

828
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:51,270
but we did do it and literally one shot

829
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,330
out of the entire ones that we took

830
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:54,530
and it is beautiful and it is framed

831
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,727
and I get to look at this every single night

832
00:26:56,727 --> 00:26:58,757
before I go to bed and just say I love you

833
00:26:58,757 --> 00:26:59,839
to all the most important people in my entire life.

834
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:02,275
Every time I look at this photo, I start tearing up.

835
00:27:02,275 --> 00:27:04,604
It just means a lot that it is right here.

836
00:27:04,604 --> 00:27:07,870
Moving on, we have two double doors right here

837
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:10,137
that lead to the master bedroom.

838
00:27:10,137 --> 00:27:11,840
Now, as soon as you walk into the room,

839
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,720
there are two doors on the left and right

840
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,920
and that is where my closets are.

841
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,730
It is supposed to be like a his and hers type of closet

842
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:20,370
but it's just a sister and sister closet

843
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:22,142
because it's literally just me living here.

844
00:27:22,142 --> 00:27:24,060
But this is pretty much the closet where I keep

845
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:27,200
all of my like more kind of nice pieces.

846
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,410
Moving over across the hall,

847
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:30,406
this is more like ath-leisure type of closet.

848
00:27:30,406 --> 00:27:32,570
It's just like everyday type of pieces.

849
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:34,410
I have all my hoodies on top, organized by color.

850
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:36,820
The white stuff is here, gray, black, black,

851
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:39,010
and then the occasional few color pieces

852
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:40,816
that I do happen to own, are up here.

853
00:27:40,816 --> 00:27:44,270
I have all my different t-shirts on the bottom row

854
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:46,485
and then I like to keep my sister apparel stuff right here

855
00:27:46,485 --> 00:27:49,250
for super easy access. So walking out of the closet,

856
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,940
we get to the actually master bedroom,

857
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,380
which is literally my favorite area in the entire house.

858
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:56,560
I could not imagine this coming out literally any better

859
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,620
and I am so blessed and lucky

860
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,700
that I get to go to sleep here every single night.

861
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,970
As you guys saw in Tuesday's video,

862
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:03,570
before this kind of whole house restoration

863
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:05,563
started with Mr. Kate,

864
00:28:05,563 --> 00:28:06,690
the only thing that I had in this room

865
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:09,430
were a mattress and also a leather poof

866
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:11,090
from my old closet in downtown.

867
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:13,013
So it was definitely time for a full room makeover

868
00:28:13,013 --> 00:28:15,041
and I filled this up to actually feel like a master suite.

869
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:18,169
So I got this bed from Gets Laid Beds in the UK.

870
00:28:18,169 --> 00:28:21,817
I love the name, unfortunately hasn't happened yet,

871
00:28:21,817 --> 00:28:26,817
but who knows, maybe 2019 is my year, probably not.

872
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:29,010
This quilt, my best friend Drew actually made

873
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:30,922
by sewing together a bunch of different textured patterns

874
00:28:30,922 --> 00:28:32,830
which I love how it turned out.

875
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:35,350
I think it looks so frickin' cute.

876
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,850
And once again, we just have a ton of

877
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:38,440
different textures on the pillows.

878
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,460
This one was a DIY project as well,

879
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,871
this one was from CB2, and this one HomeGoods, HomeGoods.

880
00:28:41,871 --> 00:28:46,060
This is the bed and it's literally so comfortable

881
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,717
and I love waking up here every single morning.

882
00:28:47,717 --> 00:28:50,220
It just feels so bright and lively

883
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,460
and I'm actually excited to start my day,

884
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,875
which is rare I feel like for a lot of people.

885
00:28:54,875 --> 00:28:56,758
If we roll off the bed this way,

886
00:28:56,758 --> 00:28:59,850
did you love that little action that just happened?

887
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:01,942
We have the sisters piano,

888
00:29:01,942 --> 00:29:05,139
gifted to me by one of my best friends, Grayson Dolan,

889
00:29:05,139 --> 00:29:07,277
just like Ethan's bench in the beauty room,

890
00:29:07,277 --> 00:29:09,390
Grayson got this for me for our Christmas video

891
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:11,600
and it's probably my favorite gift

892
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,970
that I ever received from anybody.

893
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:14,724
I started bawling crying when he revealed it to me.

894
00:29:14,724 --> 00:29:17,590
Obviously the twins have a very, very special place

895
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,420
in my heart and the fact that they went out of their way

896
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:22,460
to do this stuff was literally was just like insane.

897
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,610
I have this proudly displayed in my master bedroom,

898
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:26,481
so I can now play piano on both floors of the house

899
00:29:26,481 --> 00:29:29,147
and serenade any boy that I may have over.

900
00:29:29,147 --> 00:29:31,882
Although, that would maybe scare them off.

901
00:29:31,882 --> 00:29:34,570
Coming over this way, speaking of having boys

902
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:35,920
and other friends over,

903
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,456
in the middle of the bedroom is this beautiful living space

904
00:29:37,456 --> 00:29:40,215
which I'm so excited about because obviously

905
00:29:40,215 --> 00:29:42,360
I did not really know what to put in here

906
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:45,030
because there was literally just a poof in here before.

907
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,540
But since there as so much space,

908
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,214
Mr. Kate and Joey suggested that we should make it into a

909
00:29:48,214 --> 00:29:51,064
kind of like formal living room in the bedroom

910
00:29:51,064 --> 00:29:53,103
and I love how it turned out.

911
00:29:53,103 --> 00:29:56,902
Oh my god, I feel like this just looks like so, so good.

912
00:29:56,902 --> 00:29:59,629
The couch, the side table, both of these chairs,

913
00:29:59,629 --> 00:30:02,477
and the acrylic coffee table that was once downstairs,

914
00:30:02,477 --> 00:30:03,877
were all from CB2

915
00:30:03,877 --> 00:30:06,210
and I love that this area all came together.

916
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:08,010
Now there is so much space for all my friends and I

917
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:09,658
to sit down and chill watching TV,

918
00:30:09,658 --> 00:30:11,832
by the fire, keeping it nice and warm.

919
00:30:11,832 --> 00:30:13,652
Also speaking of fire,

920
00:30:13,652 --> 00:30:17,098
we have these super cute fire and fireplace tools

921
00:30:17,098 --> 00:30:19,024
and also this little log rack,

922
00:30:19,024 --> 00:30:21,450
even though this fireplace is 100% electric

923
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:22,780
and we can't even open it up anyway.

924
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:25,076
But it's for the aesthetic purposes of it all.

925
00:30:25,076 --> 00:30:27,560
And last but finally not least,

926
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,190
we have this shelving unit once again,

927
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:30,950
similar to the ones downstairs.

928
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:32,610
It's all black so we tried to pick some more

929
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:34,681
lighter pieces and lots of different textures and shades

930
00:30:34,681 --> 00:30:36,410
to kind of bring it all together.

931
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:37,243
I'm not really sure why,

932
00:30:37,243 --> 00:30:38,900
but I feel like this shelf is like my favorite one

933
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:39,850
of the entire house.

934
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:41,053
Walk over this way,

935
00:30:42,372 --> 00:30:43,977
we have another huge selfie mirror.

936
00:30:43,977 --> 00:30:45,123
Same exact one that was in the guest room.

937
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:46,963
Same purpose, taking cute little OOTD pics

938
00:30:46,963 --> 00:30:48,719
and I love how this whole background

939
00:30:48,719 --> 00:30:50,410
of the bedroom and sitting area looks,

940
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:52,077
especially with the light in the upper corner.

941
00:30:52,077 --> 00:30:53,550
You're just gonna check your makeup,

942
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:55,530
make sure you still look flawless and good and fresh,

943
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:58,040
and we've looked better,

944
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,730
we looked better in the guest room, but it's okay.

945
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:01,609
We're just gonna forget about it and move on

946
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:03,170
and hope that the youtube quality saves us.

947
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:06,249
That is pretty much all of the master bedroom all complete

948
00:31:06,249 --> 00:31:08,257
and last but not least,

949
00:31:08,257 --> 00:31:10,216
heading into the master bathroom,

950
00:31:10,216 --> 00:31:12,168
where I get to sister shower.

951
00:31:12,168 --> 00:31:14,840
Basically this entire back wall is all a mirror

952
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,130
which I really, really like.

953
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:17,840
There is so much space to get ready in here.

954
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,567
I could be brushing my teeth,

955
00:31:19,567 --> 00:31:21,490
my friends could be getting ready and doing their hair

956
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:23,740
all along this countertop space which is so convenient.

957
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,760
I keep all of my toothbrushes and hair supplies

958
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,330
and different skincare stuff all right here on a little tray

959
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:30,670
and all these drawers are just

960
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:31,930
filled with personal care items

961
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:33,470
which you definitely don't need to see.

962
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:35,340
The master bathtub is right here where I get to sit

963
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,740
and just take my bath and kind of relax.

964
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,490
I don't actually think I've taken a single bath

965
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:41,131
in this house yet,

966
00:31:41,131 --> 00:31:42,130
but it is on my bucket list and I do have some

967
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:43,978
bath bombs at the ready for a nice and relaxing night.

968
00:31:43,978 --> 00:31:48,130
And of course, we do have a major shower here as well,

969
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:50,970
which is literally the best thing in the entire world.

970
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:53,730
Oh my god, you could fit 100 people in here,

971
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:55,900
not like there's ever gonna be anyone in here with me,

972
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,436
unfortunately, but it is so fun.

973
00:31:57,436 --> 00:31:59,530
We have a regular shower head

974
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:01,422
and also the rain shower as well which is so fun

975
00:32:01,422 --> 00:32:05,510
for a full showering experience, if you will, I guess.

976
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:07,280
The acoustics in here are pretty good and fresh

977
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,377
so there's lots of concerts going on in the shower as well.

978
00:32:09,377 --> 00:32:11,096
Can you see the rainbow?

979
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:12,445
Love that. - It's so cool.

980
00:32:12,445 --> 00:32:15,683
- Is it right there? - Yeah, just a little reminder

981
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:17,578
that you are in fact gay.

982
00:32:17,578 --> 00:32:19,109
- I think they know.

983
00:32:19,109 --> 00:32:20,420
(laughing)

984
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:21,650
Alright you guys, that is pretty much

985
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:23,610
the master bathroom all complete.

986
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:25,097
Which means the master bedroom is all complete

987
00:32:25,097 --> 00:32:26,676
and which basically means,

988
00:32:26,676 --> 00:32:30,320
I think we're pretty much done with my house tour.

989
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,750
Oh my god.

990
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,900
Well, I really, really hope you guys enjoy this video

991
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,924
and like all the decor and stuff that we came up with.

992
00:32:35,924 --> 00:32:38,710
I have never been happier in my entire life.

993
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:41,210
It is truly the best feeling in the entire world

994
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:43,700
to have a beautiful, fully decorated house

995
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,330
that I get to wake up in every single morning,

996
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,407
that I get to get work done in,

997
00:32:47,407 --> 00:32:49,636
and that I get to invite friends and family over

998
00:32:49,636 --> 00:32:51,512
to create memories every single day

999
00:32:51,512 --> 00:32:52,360
and this would not be possible if it were not for you guys,

1000
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,120
so thank you so much.

1001
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,617
Well you guys, I really, really hope you enjoyed

1002
00:32:55,617 --> 00:32:57,660
my finished house tour video.

1003
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,780
I am very, very proud of myself for actually getting it done

1004
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:02,500
and not waiting until literally the week before

1005
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,350
I move out in a few years.

1006
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:04,420
So I really, really hope you enjoyed

1007
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,070
