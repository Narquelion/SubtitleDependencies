00:00:00,103 --> 00:00:01,310
- Hi sisters!

2
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:04,030
James Charles here and welcome back to my YouTube channel.

3
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:06,680
As many of you guys know, yesterday was February 14th,

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,480
meaning we celebrated Valentine's Day,

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,390
which is probably my least favorite holiday of all time.

6
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:14,120
I've been single for about 19 years now and at this point,

7
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,082
I'm really having trouble figuring out why.

8
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:18,029
I like to think I'm pretty good looking,

9
00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:19,983
I'm funny every once in awhile,

10
00:00:19,983 --> 00:00:23,223
have a beautiful house, steady income, lovely family,

11
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:26,020
lots of Instagram followers, that's a fun plus too.

12
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:29,200
I can really only think of one issue

13
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,770
that may get in the way and that's that

14
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:32,850
I'm a boy and all the boys that I'm

15
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,853
interested in are straight,

16
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,300
but that can't be it, right?

17
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,380
After a lot of thought,

18
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,720
I finally decided okay James, you need help.

19
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,110
It's been long enough.

20
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,810
I decided to reach out to cupid

21
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:47,200
and as you can see from the three arrows

22
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,300
lodged into my head right now,

23
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,600
he was really out there trying for me yesterday,

24
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,110
but unfortunately I think the arrows

25
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:54,930
may have missed the boys because

26
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,380
I woke up today and I'm still single.

27
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,736
Not gonna lie, at first I was really, really sad about it.

28
00:00:59,736 --> 00:01:01,990
I've wanted a boyfriend for so long now.

29
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:05,487
I've been trying really hard and it hasn't been working out.

30
00:01:05,487 --> 00:01:07,550
I imagine the cute dates and taking them out to dinner

31
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:10,929
and driving around and taking cute Instagram photos with.

32
00:01:10,929 --> 00:01:11,900
(man sighs)

33
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,780
But then my mood started to change and

34
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,820
I really had to take a step back and think.

35
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,870
Why am I gonna spend the entire day being sad

36
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,613
when I could be happy instead?

37
00:01:19,613 --> 00:01:21,190
I know my prince charming will come

38
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:23,600
one day if I'm patient, maybe.

39
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,430
Even if another boy doesn't love me back right now,

40
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:28,790
at least I know that I love me and that's all that matters.

41
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:31,400
I decided to spend my day on myself

42
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,100
doing what I love the absolute most, playing with makeup,

43
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,980
and this is the look that I came up with.

44
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,260
Without further ado,

45
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,490
if you wanna see how I created this

46
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,642
anti Valentine's Day makeup look, keep on watching.

47
00:01:41,642 --> 00:01:44,225
(upbeat music)

48
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:50,570
Alright you guys, let's just jump right into

49
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,270
this pretty in depth tutorial.

50
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:54,510
We're gonna be focusing mostly on the eyes,

51
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:55,930
what's going on underneath the glitter,

52
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:57,201
and also the arrows that we're going to

53
00:01:57,201 --> 00:01:59,756
sister stab into my head for a real one.

54
00:01:59,756 --> 00:02:02,240
As you can see, I'm starting off with my base already done.

55
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,690
I just went ahead off camera and used

56
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,300
my normal products like always, but for my brows,

57
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,320
I did use something a little bit different

58
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,554
that I get to tell you guys about today

59
00:02:09,554 --> 00:02:11,963
and that is, drum roll please,

60
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:16,870
the brand new Anastasia Dip Brow Gel.

61
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,000
I am very, very honored that Anastasia asked me

62
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,730
to be the first beauty guru to reveal this to you guys.

63
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:23,220
It is basically exactly what you would think,

64
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,620
a hybrid between Dip Brow and brow gel.

65
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,140
It is an insanely pigmented, super full coverage,

66
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:32,350
waterproof, and smudge-proof brow gel.

67
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:34,810
It comes just like this and this has

68
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:37,960
literally been my newest staple addition to my brow routine.

69
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,550
I'm obsessed with this.

70
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,070
I'm not gonna go too much more in depth

71
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,550
because Anastasia's gonna be talking about it

72
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:43,550
a lot in the next few weeks.

73
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:46,010
If you guys wanna see how I fully use it,

74
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:47,920
make sure to check out my video next Friday,

75
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,840
but I just wanted to give you guys

76
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,910
a little sneak peek of it now.

77
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,240
Here it is and get ready for this

78
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,780
to literally take over the brow world.

79
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,840
Now that being said, my face is done,

80
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,360
my brows are locked in place,

81
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,500
and let's move right along to the eyeshadow

82
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,760
portion of this look.

83
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,660
I'm just gonna go ahead and zoom you guys right in

84
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,945
to my face so you guys can get all the

85
00:03:04,945 --> 00:03:06,850
details for the eye portions.

86
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,130
I don't really do tutorials very often, but whenever I do,

87
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,680
you guys always ask me to zoom in

88
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,940
so you can actually see what's going on.

89
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,480
Hopefully this is good.

90
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,060
Welcome to my face.

91
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,500
It's very crusted and pimply right now,

92
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,470
but we're gonna make it work.

93
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:19,330
Starting off this look today,

94
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,910
I'm just gonna grab my MAC Paint Pot in the shade Painterly

95
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,790
and apply a generous coat of this to my eyelid.

96
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,170
I'm just gonna blend this all over the lid,

97
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,681
acting as our eye base slash primer.

98
00:03:28,681 --> 00:03:31,720
I'm not going to set this in with any powder.

99
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,220
Grabbing the James Charles x Morphe palette

100
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:36,880
and an M456 brush, use code JAMES for 10% off your purchase,

101
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,320
I'm gonna dip right into the shade Boutique with this brush

102
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,630
and use this color to start stamping

103
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,663
that cut crease shape into my lid.

104
00:03:41,663 --> 00:03:43,870
Just going to focus and push this color

105
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,930
right above my natural crease because

106
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:48,430
we are going to cut it a little bit later on,

107
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,610
but I just wanted to lay down the darkest shade first

108
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:52,890
and then we're going to blend upwards.

109
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,010
Once we get to this outer corner,

110
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,290
I'm just going to feather it out and pull it up

111
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,980
in the shape of a wing.

112
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,377
I'm next gonna grab a little bit of a bigger fluffy brush,

113
00:03:59,377 --> 00:04:02,630
the is the M433, and dip into the shade Love That

114
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:05,650
in the palette and use that to buff out Boutique.

115
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,270
I'm basically just stamping this color on there

116
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:11,100
and then using very, very tiny and light circular motions,

117
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,050
just lightly diffusing it upwards.

118
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:15,750
Make sure that there are no harsh lines or edges.

119
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,857
Grabbing a different M433,

120
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:19,530
I'm gonna dip into the shade Skip in the bottom corner.

121
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:20,970
This is the bright neon pink.

122
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,337
I'm gonna use that color to buff out Love That.

123
00:04:22,337 --> 00:04:24,720
I'm not liking how this is looking.

124
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,142
Maybe if I grab a little bit of You're Kidding

125
00:04:26,142 --> 00:04:28,430
and put this overtop?

126
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,060
This eyeshadow look so far is turning out

127
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,820
like every single relationship I've ever had,

128
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,760
a major failure.

129
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,950
That's looking a wee bit better.

130
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,070
Now that we have the crease all laid out

131
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,012
and kind of blended,

132
00:04:38,012 --> 00:04:39,340
I'm gonna grab a little bit of the

133
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,820
Tarte Shape Tape concealer and just

134
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,730
put in on the back of my hand.

135
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:45,614
Using a flat top brush, I'm just going to cut the crease.

136
00:04:45,614 --> 00:04:47,300
Just going to stamp this brush

137
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,170
right above my natural crease.

138
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:53,660
Then we're just going to carve out the line.

139
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,804
Wow, that is a cute crease if I ever did see one.

140
00:04:56,804 --> 00:04:59,251
♪ Thank God something went right ♪

141
00:04:59,251 --> 00:05:01,216
♪ I'd like to thank not only God ♪

142
00:05:01,216 --> 00:05:03,578
♪ But also Jesus ♪

143
00:05:03,578 --> 00:05:07,142
♪ And cupid ♪

144
00:05:07,142 --> 00:05:10,263
♪ Just kidding, he's a little bitch ♪

145
00:05:10,263 --> 00:05:11,730
Once the lid is all cut and the

146
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:12,780
concealer has dried down a little bit,

147
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,910
I'm gonna grab an M124 brush and

148
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:17,640
dip into the shade Pinkity Drinkity in my palette

149
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,750
and I'm going to use this color to set in the lid.

150
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,070
Then to cut that crease even further

151
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,980
and just add a little pop of something,

152
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:27,160
I'm gonna grab the Urban Decay Heavy Metal glitter liner.

153
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,550
This one is in the shade Grind.

154
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:31,170
It's a light pink almost holographic glitter in here

155
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,260
and we're just going to use this and

156
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:36,070
line right in this crease area, following that cut.

157
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,520
You're gonna wanna take a deep breath

158
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,330
and go very slow while you do this.

159
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:42,260
Be patient because if you mess us this line,

160
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:45,010
it's gonna look so crusted and dusted and wonky.

161
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,660
You also will definitely have to do

162
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:48,052
multiple layers on this liner because

163
00:05:48,052 --> 00:05:50,730
if you want it to look good, you have to do a lot of layers.

164
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,540
If you do make any mistakes with the liner,

165
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,540
just fan your eyeball until everything dries

166
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:57,710
and then very, very carefully you can

167
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,470
scrape it off using a pair of tweezers.

168
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:00,303
That's for eyeliner.

169
00:06:00,303 --> 00:06:02,350
You could do just a black wing if that's all you have,

170
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,360
but I feel like to go along with the pink

171
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,258
and monochrome type look that we have going on,

172
00:06:06,258 --> 00:06:09,672
I wanna do a kind of muted cranberry type of color.

173
00:06:09,672 --> 00:06:12,440
I'm gonna grab two different Kylie liquid lipsticks.

174
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,270
We have a bright pink, just a bright red,

175
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,810
and then also a black gel liner

176
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:17,640
and kind of mix together a little concoction

177
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,360
to get a muted maroon.

178
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,390
I'm gonna grab my Anastasia number 12 brush,

179
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,380
it's just an angled brush,

180
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,550
and dip right into this and use this color

181
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,603
to draw my winged liner.

182
00:06:25,603 --> 00:06:28,100
That is pretty much the upper lid all complete.

183
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,800
It was a little bit of a journey to get here,

184
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,633
but in the end,

185
00:06:30,633 --> 00:06:33,113
I think this cut crease turned out really, really bomb.

186
00:06:33,113 --> 00:06:35,290
Let's go ahead and move on to the lower lash line.

187
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:36,860
Using the same colors and brushes from before,

188
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,020
I'm gonna grab my M456 and dip into

189
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,802
a little bit of Love That and Boutique

190
00:06:40,802 --> 00:06:43,400
and buff that right up along the lower lash line.

191
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,020
Just placing it right in there and

192
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,483
making sure to connect that up with the outer wing as well.

193
00:06:47,483 --> 00:06:50,170
With my M433, gonna dip into Skip.

194
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:52,240
I'm gonna pull this shadow down pretty far as well

195
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,400
and really buff it out.

196
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,940
We are gonna be putting on glitter

197
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:55,840
and I wanna make sure that there's

198
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,082
kind of a color behind it.

199
00:06:57,082 --> 00:06:59,690
Be careful of any staining.

200
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:00,911
Before I move on to any glitter,

201
00:07:00,911 --> 00:07:01,744
I'm gonna grab a little bit of the

202
00:07:01,744 --> 00:07:04,040
Jeffree Star liquid lipstick in the shade Drug Lord

203
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,250
and a tiny little detail brush,

204
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,480
this is the Morphe M170-4 brush,

205
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,640
and using a tiny little bit of this on the back of my hand,

206
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,450
I'm going to use this to cut out my inner corner

207
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:14,240
and also line my waterline.

208
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,280
I'm just gonna set that white in place

209
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,110
using a little bit more of Pinkity Drinkity.

210
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,490
Using a pencil brush, I'm gonna grab the shade Literally

211
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:21,550
and I'm going to use this color to highlight.

212
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:24,340
I'm just gonna place this color right over my brow bone

213
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,840
and then right in that inner corner as well.

214
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,990
Then with another tiny detail brush,

215
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,650
I'm gonna dip into the shade Sister,

216
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:32,350
which is a metallic kind of rose gold color,

217
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,050
and I'm going to give that a quick little

218
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,930
spritz of Prep and Set and then

219
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,905
apply that shade right overtop of Literally.

220
00:07:37,905 --> 00:07:39,457
Wow, look at that.

221
00:07:39,457 --> 00:07:41,377
Now I wanna go in and add little glitter,

222
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:46,040
little glitter heart tears to this look.

223
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,330
If you guys remember a few months ago,

224
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,500
I did my recreating my follower's makeup looks video.

225
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,290
I did that rainbow cloud eye,

226
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:53,660
one of my favorite looks literally of all time.

227
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,780
I had little glitter tears dripping down from it.

228
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,890
I'm basically gonna do the same exact thing on this eye,

229
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:59,610
but all in a monochromatic pink.

230
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:00,940
I'm first just gonna dust off any

231
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,420
translucent powder that I have sitting and

232
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,480
baking on my face.

233
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,460
To draw in the little glitter tears,

234
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,280
I'm just gonna grab a tiny liner brush.

235
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,740
This one I literally still have in my

236
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,560
brush set from when I did my art supplies video

237
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,860
over a year ago now.

238
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,309
These ones are so good because they are so detailed.

239
00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:17,190
Then just dipping into a little bit more of Love That.

240
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,530
(makeup product falls)

241
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:19,363
Oops.

242
00:08:19,363 --> 00:08:21,120
I'm basically just gonna scribble these in down my cheek.

243
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,953
When I'm drawing these in,

244
00:08:21,953 --> 00:08:23,450
I'm using a super, super light hand,

245
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:25,530
but then adding more pressure in certain areas

246
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:27,940
just so the color for one, isn't all even throughout

247
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,073
and this is gonna give it kind of that

248
00:08:29,073 --> 00:08:32,805
watercolor actual teardrop type of effect.

249
00:08:32,805 --> 00:08:34,610
Then on top, I'm basically just going to

250
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:37,240
randomly apply an assortment of loose glitters.

251
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,080
These ones are from In Your Dreams Cosmetics I believe.

252
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,640
This one is from Violet Voss and

253
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,440
then I also have these chunky glitters

254
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,990
that I got I think from Michael's.

255
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,650
They have tiny little pink heart glitters in here,

256
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:49,600
which is perfect and I'm gonna glue these on the tears

257
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,410
as if I'm crying hearts.

258
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:52,580
Starting with the tiny little hearts,

259
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,910
I'm just gonna use lash glue to dab them on.

260
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,510
If you have any really ridiculous pimples,

261
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,380
this is a great way to cover it right up.

262
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,070
Alright sisters, and I think that is one eye

263
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:02,638
of this anti Valentine's Day look all complete.

264
00:09:02,638 --> 00:09:06,033
I love how this little glitter crying tears

265
00:09:06,033 --> 00:09:07,424
cute crease turned out,

266
00:09:07,424 --> 00:09:10,130
but that did take me quite a little bit of time.

267
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:11,245
Sorry for not talking very much.

268
00:09:11,245 --> 00:09:12,790
I'm gonna quickly go off camera

269
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:15,010
and do the other eye and be right as close as I can get,

270
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:15,950
pop on a pair of lashes,

271
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,859
and I'll be right back to finish off the rest of the look

272
00:09:17,859 --> 00:09:20,270
and get into some sister special effects

273
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,700
with cupid's arrows.

274
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,900
Alright sisters, we are back.

275
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:26,060
The eyes are looking relatively symmetrical right now

276
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,161
and I also popped on a pair of Lily Lashes

277
00:09:27,161 --> 00:09:30,470
Miami So Extras on the eye.

278
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,490
I think the eyes turned out so beautiful,

279
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:34,695
but now it is time to move on to the rest of the face.

280
00:09:34,695 --> 00:09:36,930
Next up of course is going to be the highlighter.

281
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,350
We have to get our glow on,

282
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,179
which I'm now realizing I probably should've done

283
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:41,910
before adding in the glitter tears

284
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,690
considering it's gonna overlap a little bit,

285
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:45,610
but it wouldn't be a James Charles

286
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:47,655
video without some poor planning.

287
00:09:47,655 --> 00:09:48,650
Let's do it.

288
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,599
I'm gonna grab the Morphe Prep and Set setting spray

289
00:09:50,599 --> 00:09:52,560
and give my face a quick little spritz

290
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,436
just so the highlighter has something to stick to.

291
00:09:55,436 --> 00:09:57,820
Then grabbing my Morphe M501 brush,

292
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,780
I'm just gonna dip right into the shade Literally

293
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,885
from my palette and lay this down as

294
00:10:01,885 --> 00:10:05,810
kind of a blush mixer pre-highlighter color.

295
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:06,720
Then using a JH30 brush,

296
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,220
I'm just gonna grab a little bit of a mixture of Face

297
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,280
and also a tiny bit of Sister for a more

298
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,840
pink rose gold iridescent glow,

299
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,483
give it a quick little spritz of Prep and Set

300
00:10:15,483 --> 00:10:19,600
and then just go right in overtop for a blinding glow.

301
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,910
If I can't attract the boys myself,

302
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,210
maybe this highlighter will help.

303
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:24,870
Not with jokes like that, oh my God.

304
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:27,080
Little bit above the brow bone as always.

305
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,240
Then...(man screeches) down the center of my nose.

306
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,870
You guys, I don't know how my nose contour

307
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,140
looks this good right now and it's

308
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,350
probably never gonna look like this again

309
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:37,587
so let's say a silent prayer and cherish this moment

310
00:10:37,587 --> 00:10:38,953
as we highlight using a pencil brush.

311
00:10:38,953 --> 00:10:42,530
This is the M431 and a little bit more of Face.

312
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:44,137
Now we get to move on to the lips.

313
00:10:44,137 --> 00:10:46,170
For the lip, I do wanna stick with a nude color.

314
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:47,240
I know, kind of boring.

315
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,450
Of course you could do a maroon

316
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:50,150
or a darker color to match the liner,

317
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,780
but since we have so much going on

318
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,240
and we're gonna add more in a few minutes,

319
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,372
I do think a nude will be a good option.

320
00:10:55,372 --> 00:10:57,000
Before I do that though,

321
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,690
I am gonna grab the Kylie liquid lipstick

322
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:00,500
that we used beforehand for that bright pink,

323
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,090
this is Say It No More, and use this to just line the lips

324
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:04,660
so when we add the nude overtop,

325
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:07,320
it'll be a very pinky nude as opposed to

326
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,700
a more peachy nude.

327
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,830
Honestly, it doesn't even look that bad, that pink,

328
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:14,173
but that's...a little much for me I think.

329
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,189
That was a rhyme!

330
00:11:15,189 --> 00:11:16,713
♪ It doesn't even look that bad, that pink ♪

331
00:11:16,713 --> 00:11:18,443
♪ But that's a little bit much for me I think ♪

332
00:11:18,443 --> 00:11:20,384
(man laughs)

333
00:11:20,384 --> 00:11:21,373
On top of that,

334
00:11:21,373 --> 00:11:22,840
I'm gonna add the Ofra liquid lipstick

335
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,300
in the shade Sao Paolo.

336
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,050
You guys know this is my all time favorite nude.

337
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,530
You can use code JAMES for 30% off.

338
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:29,950
I'm just gonna layer this overtop to like I said,

339
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:32,674
create a more nudey color out of this bright pink.

340
00:11:32,674 --> 00:11:34,420
Then finally, just a little bit of Drug Lord

341
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,010
right in the middle for a nice highlight.

342
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:37,188
Alright sisters, that is pretty much this

343
00:11:37,188 --> 00:11:38,732
Valentine's Day look all complete.

344
00:11:38,732 --> 00:11:41,370
I'm now realizing that it would've been a lot smarter

345
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:43,100
to add the glitter tears in the next step

346
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,880
along with the arrows to go from a

347
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,070
Valentine's Day wearable actually pretty look

348
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:50,515
to a more non-wearable anti Valentine's Day look,

349
00:11:50,515 --> 00:11:53,230
but guess who didn't think of that?

350
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:55,050
Me, so I guess this is your wearable

351
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:57,280
Valentine's Day look for today.

352
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,460
You could totally stop here.

353
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,430
Even with the glitter tears,

354
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,500
I think this look did turn out very, very beautiful,

355
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,280
but if are like me and you've been

356
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,690
single for a very, very long time, 19 years to be exact,

357
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:08,780
and you do not like this holiday anymore,

358
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,700
keep on watching and let's add some special effects

359
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,363
to make this an anti Valentine's Day look.

360
00:12:12,363 --> 00:12:14,950
Jumping right in before we even get to the makeup portion,

361
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,210
I'm gonna teach you guys how to make

362
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,341
the arrows super quickly.

363
00:12:17,341 --> 00:12:19,529
Love being a cute little DIY channel.

364
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:22,540
What you're going to need is red construction paper,

365
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:25,010
I just got this from literally the dollar store,

366
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:28,680
a pair of sister scissors, some super glue,

367
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,730
and then also a pair of chopsticks

368
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:32,810
from the last time that you ordered Chinese food.

369
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:34,210
Basically what I'm gonna do is start by

370
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:36,250
folding my construction paper right in half

371
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,620
and then just using my pair of scissors,

372
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:42,443
I'm gonna cut out a...parallelogram, geometry, out of this.

373
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,353
Is that what it's called?

374
00:12:46,353 --> 00:12:49,444
A parallelogram, four sides, definitely parallelogram.

375
00:12:49,444 --> 00:12:52,970
If you open it up, you have the bottom of an arrow.

376
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,580
Wow, I am such a queen of DIYs!

377
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:57,020
LaurDIY is shaking!

378
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,840
Then I'm just gonna cut this shape right in half

379
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,140
again on the fold.

380
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,250
Now we have two and then we're just gonna

381
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,660
repeat that step one more time.

382
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,046
Now cut it in half.

383
00:13:04,046 --> 00:13:05,240
Now I'm just gonna take my pair of chopsticks

384
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,840
and rip them right in half just like that

385
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,710
and then carefully, I'm just going to put a

386
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:13,690
tiny little bit of glue on the edge of this chopstick

387
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:18,150
and I'm going to stick on the bottoms of the arrow.

388
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:18,983
Perfect.

389
00:13:18,983 --> 00:13:20,690
While this dries, I have a roll of toilet paper

390
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:22,450
sitting right here that we're gonna use later on,

391
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:24,820
but I'm just going to stick this right in here

392
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,230
and let it chill.

393
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:28,016
Just repeat the same exact process two more times

394
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:29,550
for two more arrows.

395
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,240
We are back and all three arrows are complete.

396
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,331
I took my shirt off so we can do some

397
00:13:32,331 --> 00:13:34,220
(audience cheering) special effects stuff.

398
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,360
Unfortunately, that's gonna be all of the

399
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,383
shirt taking off that I'm gonna be doing this time of year.

400
00:13:38,383 --> 00:13:39,460
(audience laughs)

401
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,350
These Valentine's Day jokes are getting so old already.

402
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,197
Oh my God.

403
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,570
We get it, I'm single forever.

404
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:45,403
Okay, moving on.

405
00:13:45,403 --> 00:13:47,440
I'm just gonna take a really insanely

406
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,600
sharp pair of scissors.

407
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,870
Please be careful and use your parent's permission

408
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,721
if you for some reason are recreating this look.

409
00:13:52,721 --> 00:13:57,721
I'm basically just going to cut this here.

410
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,533
Okay.

411
00:14:02,533 --> 00:14:03,366
Next I'm gonna grab a little bit of the

412
00:14:03,366 --> 00:14:04,920
Ben Nye Nose and Scar Wax.

413
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,830
Just gonna grab one of the brushes

414
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,100
that I have laying out here and

415
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,924
grab a little chunk just like that.

416
00:14:09,924 --> 00:14:12,520
Basically, what I'm going to do is

417
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:17,480
form this around the bottom of the arrow that we just cut

418
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,060
so one, I don't stab myself with wooden shards,

419
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:23,163
but I'm also going to flatten the bottom edge just like that

420
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:26,010
and kind of pinch it out so therefore

421
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:28,040
when we stick the arrow to the skin,

422
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,470
it actually has a surface to glue to

423
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,430
as opposed to just flopping down.

424
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:34,170
Once the piece is all set and has a flat bottom,

425
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:36,560
I'm just going to set this arrow off to the side

426
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,200
and let that scar wax dry out a little bit.

427
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,890
Now we're gonna get started on the arrow holes.

428
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:42,320
If you've been subscribed for awhile,

429
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,730
you may have seen me do a few different

430
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:45,420
special effects things before.

431
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,450
I did the mermaid video, I did the melting skull video,

432
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:48,490
and I also did the video with the

433
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:50,010
twins and Emma for Halloween.

434
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:51,350
My knowledge when it comes to special effects

435
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,440
is really not that great at all and just saying

436
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,004
that I really wanna learn a lot more about,

437
00:14:55,004 --> 00:14:56,780
but those few things have allowed me

438
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,070
to achieve basically every look

439
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:00,120
that I've tried so far so we're good.

440
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:00,953
What I'm gonna start off with is a

441
00:15:00,953 --> 00:15:03,393
little bit of Ben Nye liquid latex.

442
00:15:03,393 --> 00:15:04,473
Just gonna pour a little bit of it

443
00:15:04,473 --> 00:15:06,270
into the bottom of the cap.

444
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,840
Then just grabbing an old, dirty sponge

445
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,990
that I was about to throw out anyway,

446
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:11,910
I'm just gonna dip it right into the cap.

447
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,380
I'm just going to dab this on right where

448
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,608
I'm gonna place the first arrow hole.

449
00:15:15,608 --> 00:15:16,710
Quickly before it dries,

450
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:18,861
I'm gonna grab a little bit of toilet paper just like this

451
00:15:18,861 --> 00:15:23,861
and basically rip a circular shard kind of, just like that,

452
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:27,170
and I'm just gonna stick it right overtop of that area,

453
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,937
flatten it down using my hand.

454
00:15:28,937 --> 00:15:31,110
Then just grabbing a little bit more liquid latex,

455
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:32,820
I'm going to go right in and just

456
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:36,310
press that right in and go over those edges.

457
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,020
Then we're just going to let this dry.

458
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,900
While that dries, I'm just gonna start prepping the

459
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,630
second arrow hole over here,

460
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:43,573
and then a hole right down here too.

461
00:15:46,539 --> 00:15:47,372
(high pitched ding)

462
00:15:47,372 --> 00:15:48,250
To lock those in place,

463
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,083
I'm just gonna use a little bit of

464
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,700
translucent setting powder to make sure

465
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,180
that none of the latex is still sticking.

466
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,640
Then just using a small concealer brush

467
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,400
and a little bit of foundation of the back of my hand,

468
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,738
I'm going to quickly repaint over those areas

469
00:15:58,738 --> 00:16:01,080
to disguise the latex.

470
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,480
Now that the new skin is pretty much

471
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,300
as disguised as we're gonna be able to get it,

472
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,500
we get to do the fun and also dangerous part

473
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,826
so please be careful.

474
00:16:07,826 --> 00:16:10,288
I'm gonna grab a tiny little pair of eyelash scissors

475
00:16:10,288 --> 00:16:15,288
and I'm basically going to cut a small hole in the skin

476
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:18,680
right in the middle of where the toilet paper is.

477
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,513
Once you get through,

478
00:16:19,513 --> 00:16:20,660
you just kind of snip around a little bit

479
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:24,213
and take some of the excess off to kind of form a hole.

480
00:16:24,213 --> 00:16:26,320
That is pretty much exactly what you're going for.

481
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,990
It looks really, really gross, I know,

482
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:29,210
but we're gonna fill it up.

483
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:31,320
Now I'm going to grab the arrow.

484
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,960
Then grabbing a little bit of Spirit Gum,

485
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,530
this stuff is basically liquid adhesive.

486
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:38,420
It is what a lot of drag queens use to glue down their wigs.

487
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,560
Just gonna put a little bit of this

488
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:43,030
inside of the hole on my skin.

489
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:45,110
You actually activate this glue by tapping it,

490
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:46,720
so I'm just gonna kind of jiggle my finger in there

491
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,710
a little bit just so it gets kind of tacky.

492
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,080
Then I'm also gonna put a generous layer of that

493
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,060
on the bottom of the scar wax that we put on earlier

494
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:56,140
and I'm going to tap that as well until it gets tacky.

495
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,370
Once it's looking pretty good,

496
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:59,950
I'm basically just going to take this arrow

497
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:03,750
and carefully maneuver it right into the hole

498
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,040
and then stick it to my forehead.

499
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,993
This is not going well.

500
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:10,360
(man sighs)

501
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,556
Instead, we're going to figure this out.

502
00:17:12,556 --> 00:17:15,040
I can superglue this to the thing,

503
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,580
but do you think that'll stick it to my head?

504
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:17,413
I don't care.

505
00:17:17,413 --> 00:17:18,246
Let's go.

506
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:19,710
This is so not safe.

507
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:21,080
That's okay, don't do this at home.

508
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,480
Please stay, please stay, please stay.

509
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,630
Yas!

510
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:27,800
I am the queen of special effects, just let everybody know.

511
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,010
Before this literally falls off my head,

512
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:30,167
I have two different types of blood,

513
00:17:30,167 --> 00:17:32,120
the liquid Ben Nye Stage Blood and

514
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,043
the not liquid Ben Nye Thick Blood.

515
00:17:34,043 --> 00:17:35,810
I'm gonna use a mixture of both of these

516
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:37,920
to make it look like this is bleeding.

517
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:41,400
I'm just going to dab this around for the puncture wound.

518
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,840
This is also going to help hide

519
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,780
the seams of the liquid latex too.

520
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,090
I'm gonna put some kind of going up

521
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:47,910
the base of the arrow as well because

522
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,592
if this were to actually fly into my head,

523
00:17:49,592 --> 00:17:52,920
there would definitely be some sister splatter.

524
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,880
That is dark.

525
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,930
Gonna use my hand to tap out any excess

526
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:58,530
and to kind of fade it in.

527
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:00,670
Then I'm just going to use some Thick Blood

528
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:04,366
and this is going to go right inside of the hole.

529
00:18:04,366 --> 00:18:09,366
This step is so gross and actually makes it look real.

530
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,893
The tendons are really just flying out for a real one.

531
00:18:11,893 --> 00:18:13,450
That is one arrow all complete.

532
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:14,283
Oh my God you guys,

533
00:18:14,283 --> 00:18:17,210
I cannot believe how freaking real and crazy this looks.

534
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:19,077
I'm gonna now do the other two quickly and carefully

535
00:18:19,077 --> 00:18:21,120
before this one flies off and I'll be

536
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,341
right back with the finished look.

537
00:18:22,341 --> 00:18:25,841
(upbeat electronic music)

538
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,920
Alright sisters, several hours, lots of liquid latex,

539
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,709
and lots of superglue later,

540
00:18:42,709 --> 00:18:46,921
that is this anti Valentine's Day look all complete.

541
00:18:46,921 --> 00:18:49,550
Unfortunately for me, I am still very much single,

542
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,190
which means cupid's arrows did not hit

543
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,430
any boys for me yesterday,

544
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,880
but I think he may have missed and hit me twice

545
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,680
because I am literally in love with

546
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,410
how this makeup look turned out today

547
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,800
and I really, really hope you guys enjoyed this video.

548
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,056
If you celebrated Valentine's Day yesterday

549
00:19:02,056 --> 00:19:05,900
with a significant other, it must be nice, cannot relate,

550
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,720
but hope you guys had a really fun and fresh time,

551
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,310
wishing you the absolute best,

552
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:11,400
or if you were like me and you are sister single,

553
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,600
I still hope you had a really fun time yesterday.

554
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,780
While having a boyfriend or girlfriend

555
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,198
does lowkey kind of sound pretty fun and fresh,

556
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:18,220
don't rush it.

557
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,430
The right person will come when you least expect it

558
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:22,210
and you guys will live happily ever after.

559
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:23,950
All that matters at the end of the day

560
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:25,720
is that you love yourself and hey,

561
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,510
you also got me, sister James here, loving you as well.

562
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:30,260
All that being said, if you guys enjoyed today's video

563
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,699

581
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:03,420
if I ever do get a boyfriend first,

582
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:05,927
is James Charles with an extra S after Charles.

583
00:20:05,927 --> 00:20:08,910
