00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,860
- [James] Hi sisters James Charles here and

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:03,631
welcome back to my YouTube channel.

3
00:00:03,631 --> 00:00:05,550
Jumping right into today's brand new video, I am very

4
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,380
very excited but also nervous for this video.

5
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,350
This is something that I wanted to film

6
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:10,720
for a very very long time now

7
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,810
and that is how I used to do my makeup

8
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:14,200
versus how I do it now.

9
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,470
This trend has already been going around for a

10
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:16,410
pretty long time now so this is

11
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,070
definitely not an original idea.

12
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:19,130
A few years ago people were doing

13
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:20,880
the how I do my makeup in high school versus now

14
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,940
challenge which was so much fun to look back at everybody's

15
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,750
transformations and even I did a video a

16
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,450
few months ago where he reacted to and

17
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:28,400
recreated my first ever makeup tutorial

18
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,690
and even though I've only been in the

19
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:31,230
beauty community doing makeup for about

20
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,060
three years now I will definitely say

21
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,980
that my makeup has changed so, so, so much

22
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,020
hopefully for the better,

23
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,070
I mean I literally used to have Sharpie eyebrows

24
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:40,760
that took up half my freaking forehead

25
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,360
and a man bun that was a literal rat's

26
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,070
nest on the top of my head.

27
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,453
In the past three years I will confidently say that

28
00:00:45,453 --> 00:00:47,670
I've definitely upped my style, makeup tips,

29
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,590
techniques and products that I used so

30
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,240
for today that I thought it'd be so much fun

31
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,740
to split my face right in half and do

32
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,430
a little beauty battle with myself basically,

33
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,263
when you literally don't have

34
00:00:56,263 --> 00:00:58,060
anybody left to collab with

35
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,990
and do one half of my face how I used to do my makeup

36
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:02,120
with all the old techniques and products and

37
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,230
the other half of my face how I do it today,

38
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,060
see the comparison, see how everything has changed

39
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,310
and hopefully you guys will pick up some tips and techniques

40
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,330
of what not to do along the way.

41
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:12,180
So without further ado let's take a trip down

42
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,913
memory lane and jump right in.

43
00:01:14,976 --> 00:01:17,643
(upbeat music)

44
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,550
I just scrolled down my Instagram for several minutes.

45
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,970
Literally I have PTSD from looking at some of these

46
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:28,370
disgusting photos but I came across this look that

47
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:33,370
was posted on May 14, 2016 and it is captioned tangerine.

48
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:36,560
I feel like for the old half my face, this is a really good

49
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,010
look to do today that encompasses kind of all the techniques

50
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:42,420
that I used to use and now don't use for obvious reasons.

51
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,630
That has gotta be the harshest contour

52
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:45,310
I've ever seen in my entire life.

53
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,280
My eyebrows taking up half my forehead.

54
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,940
I will say and pat myself on the back a little bit too,

55
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,070
through scrolling down through all these repulsive looks,

56
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,450
the one thing that I was never horrible at was eyeshadow.

57
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,160
Everything else has been majorly improved

58
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,820
but I was always a pretty decent

59
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,150
at eyeshadow and it was always been my favorite part

60
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,970
of the makeup routine so definitely

61
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,970
just a super simple glam eyeshadow look.

62
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:06,470
My winged eyeliner is going straight out.

63
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,020
I don't even think I have a lash on.

64
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:12,100
My nose is not even close to contour and my lips are lined

65
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,670
normally and this was before I had anything done to them

66
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,530
so you get the picture.

67
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:17,860
I think this is the perfect look

68
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,410
to recreate today and even though it is pretty simple,

69
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,500
I think there's going to be some very dramatic changes

70
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,330
from one side to the other and hopefully I'll be

71
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:25,360
able to show you guys a lot of really

72
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,840
helpful tips and techniques so let's jump right in.

73
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,110
So the first step of a makeup routine

74
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,950
is of course always skin prep.

75
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,063
Now on the old side, I'm just gonna go right

76
00:02:32,063 --> 00:02:35,070
into the Benefit Porefessional primer, no moisturizer,

77
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,540
nothing beforehand.

78
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,930
I literally used to be obsessed with this stuff.

79
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:40,570
I would use the most of it.

80
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,170
This primer for me is one of the main reasons

81
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:43,940
that started my conspiracy theory that primers do

82
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,897
absolutely nothing because this primer actually hurt my skin

83
00:02:46,897 --> 00:02:49,380
more than it actually helped which I'll get into when

84
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,770
it comes to the nose in a little bit.

85
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,043
Now on the newer side of my face I'm going

86
00:02:53,043 --> 00:02:53,940
to first grab the Tatcha Water Cream.

87
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,920
This is my all-time favorite moisturizer

88
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,150
and a good moisturizer is super important for me

89
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:00,190
before I put on any makeup to make sure my skin

90
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,330
stays hydrated and healthy all throughout the day

91
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:06,050
and is able to breathe underneath eight ounces of product.

92
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:07,800
Obviously as you can see I'm having a very intense

93
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,610
breakout on this side of my face right now.

94
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,110
I'm not exactly sure why.

95
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,800
I've been traveling a lot recently and I've been

96
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,310
of course taking extra precaution to

97
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,640
make sure my skin stays healthy

98
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,310
but we're not gonna be taking this into

99
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,860
consideration when it comes to the final judgment later on.

100
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:20,693
Thanks.

101
00:03:20,693 --> 00:03:22,020
Although I don't always prime now,

102
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,470
when I do skincare is of course my number one priority

103
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:27,560
and that means I usually go the Tatcha Silk Canvas Primer

104
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,230
which I feel like is also very very fitting today

105
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,550
because just like the Porefessional,

106
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:32,310
this one is obviously meant to it fill in everything

107
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:35,120
and make it very, very even so hopefully

108
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,640
we're going to flatten out these pimples

109
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,540
that we have going on.

110
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,540
So normally next I would jump right into foundation,

111
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,940
but on the old makeup side

112
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,870
we actually have a few more steps to do

113
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,970
before that so I'm gonna let the primer

114
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:47,635
sit on the new side and right now we're

115
00:03:47,635 --> 00:03:49,590
going to go in and a color correct using

116
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:53,460
the LA Girl Pro concealer in the shade Literal Orange.

117
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:57,730
So I obviously am a man and I do have a 5 o'clock shadow

118
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:59,260
that is really, really inconvenient.

119
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,340
I am getting laser hair removal all over my face to

120
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,260
get rid of it because I absolutely hate it

121
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,590
but now I just use a full coverage

122
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,030
foundation and a lot of concealer to

123
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,650
cover it up to kind of eliminate using

124
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,569
87 different products on my face but

125
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:11,460
back then it was not the case,

126
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,450
so I'm gonna put this basically everywhere that hair grows.

127
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:16,400
I was apparently convinced that I was doing drag every time

128
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,970
I put my makeup on.

129
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,120
I'm just gonna blend that in using my Beauty Blender.

130
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,860
This next step I cannot believe I ever actually did,

131
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,410
but if you scroll back to one of my first

132
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:26,730
YouTube videos, it isn't most definitely there.

133
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:29,880
When I first started to makeup I had a major, major issue

134
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,330
where every time I would do my foundation

135
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,430
they would always completely slip off my nose

136
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:36,040
and leave little holes and cracks and look disgusting

137
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,920
whenever I tried to nose contour.

138
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,070
I was so convinced it was the oils in my nose

139
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,160
that I was literally just sweating

140
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,250
all day long

141
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,240
but I later found out once I was educated

142
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,290
that it was actually the Porefessional primer

143
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:48,260
not really working together with a foundation that I always

144
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,770
used and that is why.

145
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:51,710
That is also why I stopped using it this combination

146
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:54,307
but at one point I did finally find a trick to

147
00:04:54,307 --> 00:04:56,500
fix that and I taught you guys in my

148
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,800
videos if anybody remembers from

149
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,380
literally day one and that was using a

150
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:03,790
Mac Paint Pot and literally putting a

151
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:07,410
huge layer of that on my nose before I

152
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:09,360
actually put any foundation on and the

153
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,180
logic was that if the foundation slipped off

154
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,380
when I tried to contour,

155
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:15,170
there would be another extremely thick layer underneath.

156
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:16,280
Absolutely ridiculous.

157
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,440
I really could not tell you why try new primer

158
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,010
or try new foundation never crossed my mind

159
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:22,280
like a normal human being

160
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,870
but this trick did do the trick for a pretty long time.

161
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,280
I'm gonna keep my Paint Pot out because

162
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,980
we're gonna be using it later on on the new side

163
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,200
when it comes to eyeshadow

164
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,460
but it is now time to move in to foundation.

165
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,470
For foundation on the old side

166
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,910
I'm gonna grab the Make Up For Ever Ultra HD stick

167
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:36,930
in the shade Y325.

168
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,680
Now if you've been along since day one

169
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,100
you would know that this was literally

170
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,270
my ride-or-die Holy Grail.

171
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:46,300
I still to this day I really like this foundation and

172
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,310
the formula to it a lot if you guys saw

173
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,120
my finding my perfect foundation shade video

174
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,640
from a few weeks ago this was literally one

175
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,600
of my top contenders and so many of the comments

176
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,580
said you guys really, really liked this color on me

177
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,820
but when I moved to LA it was just a little bit too dry

178
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:01,061
for my skin and I've obviously moved on to Born This Way,

179
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:02,920
which is what I'm gonna put on the other side of my face.

180
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,425
I'm gonna start by blending this in using

181
00:06:04,425 --> 00:06:05,950
my Morphe M439 brush.

182
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,680
Use code James for 10% off.

183
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,130
That has never changed.

184
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:10,150
I can already tell that this color

185
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:12,420
is way, way, way too yellow for me.

186
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,190
I would always just blend the foundation right

187
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:16,140
over the color corrector as well and then always

188
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,550
be really upset and confused when I would

189
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,340
get hate comments telling me that I looked orange.

190
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,173
Should've listened.

191
00:06:20,173 --> 00:06:21,230
Now on the newer side of my face,

192
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:23,380
I'm gonna be using the Too Faced Born This Way foundation

193
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,780
and for today's look I'm gonna mix together

194
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,450
the shade of pearl and natural beige.

195
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:28,790
The Born This Way foundation is a little bit

196
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:31,620
more medium coverage but can be buildable

197
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,910
and I like this formula a lot better

198
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:34,040
because it's more hydrating

199
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,300
and keeps my skin looking healthy

200
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,670
throughout the day as opposed to cakey

201
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:37,800
and I'm just blending this and using the

202
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,450
brand new Jeffrey Star X Morphe

203
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:41,328
contour and highlight sponge.

204
00:06:41,328 --> 00:06:42,580
(beep)

205
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,600
Of course my camera stopped recording for a few seconds.

206
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,580
Sorry you guys I am back.

207
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,190
Would it really be a James Charles

208
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,870
video without a technical difficulty?

209
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:49,780
No.

210
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,360
Next I was obviously going to be concealer

211
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,740
getting right back into things.

212
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,940
I went in on the old side with the LA Girl Pro concealer

213
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,980
in the shade of porcelain, literally the lightest shade

214
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:57,813
that they have.

215
00:06:57,813 --> 00:06:59,430
I actually have nothing bad to say about this concealer.

216
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:02,400
The formula is really, really bomb and it's only $6 as well.

217
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,400
I just wanted to move on and try out different formulas.

218
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,220
So on the new side, I use the Too Faced

219
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:08,280
Born This Way concealer in the shade vanilla.

220
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,540
I'm just gonna blend this in using a Beauty Blender.

221
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,960
I want to move on to the next side pretty quickly

222
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,640
because no matter on what foundation and concealer

223
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,970
and primer I'm using on my face if I don't work fast

224
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:18,400
I get very, very creasy and crusty pretty quickly.

225
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,590
So I'm gonna grab the Coty Airspun powder on the old side.

226
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:25,250
Obviously you guys know this powder has been with me

227
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,550
since day one.

228
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,383
I love this one.

229
00:07:27,383 --> 00:07:29,060
This treated me very, very well when I was living back

230
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,360
in New York but this is also the powder that

231
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,780
created Flashback Mary

232
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,920
and definitely made me look very very cakey

233
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,830
because I was using way too much of it

234
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,390
but that's the whole point of learning

235
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,440
and improving as an artist.

236
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,510
So I'm just gonna grab a powder puff and dip right in,

237
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,700
pack this into place.

238
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,330
I can't believe that I used to literally do this.

239
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,270
On the other side of my face,

240
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:49,580
I'm gonna grab the Laura Mercier translucent setting powder

241
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,700
and I'm going to use my beauty sponge to

242
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,800
melt this into the skin.

243
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,910
Just for you know

244
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:56,350
slightly lighter coverage look,

245
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,890
I really really like using my same damp

246
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:00,510
beauty sponge to push in the powder to the skin.

247
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,290
I'm not really sure when I made this change

248
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:04,289
but I am so glad that I did because

249
00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:06,040
I feel like this just does so much better of a job

250
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,680
to still set everything in place so it doesn't slip

251
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,820
around during the day but it just looks

252
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,700
so much more natural when you're up close

253
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,700
you don't get that same kind of

254
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,020
gross cakey and dry texture that you can

255
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,530
sometimes get using a powder puff.

256
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:18,250
I just feel like it really holds up a whole lot better.

257
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,370
Then I'm gonna grab a tiny little bit of extra powder

258
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:22,760
on a fluffy brush and just go over everything to

259
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,990
make sure everything is nice and set in place

260
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:26,390
and that I didn't miss any areas.

261
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,300
Now that both halves of my face are set in place,

262
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,920
the next step of my routine is of course going to be

263
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,300
to contour and chisel everything out,

264
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,900
add some dimension, but before I do that on the new

265
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,330
side I want to go ahead and give myself

266
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,650
a quick spritz of the Morphe Prep and Set

267
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:41,680
setting spray just to kind of melt everything together

268
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,510
and this is not something that I used to do before so

269
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,979
I'm going to keep my palette up here to separate it.

270
00:08:45,979 --> 00:08:48,750
(wind chimes)

271
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,130
I don't know if you can fully see it on camera

272
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,330
but looking in the mirror this side of my skin is

273
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:54,060
definitely just looking a little bit more radiant,

274
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,570
you can kind of see the skin popping through,

275
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,720
which I really, really like whereas this side is

276
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,650
still really beautiful, it's super just

277
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:02,187
full coverage and very, very matte so

278
00:09:02,187 --> 00:09:04,180
really just depends on the type of look you're going for.

279
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,110
Now for contouring the one palette that I used to use every

280
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:08,140
single day was the Kat Von D shade and light palette

281
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,120
and not gonna lie, it had a really, really bomb formula

282
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,540
and I loved it for a long time but unfortunately

283
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,130
I no longer have it in my collection and I

284
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,884
refuse to go buy it and support her so

285
00:09:15,884 --> 00:09:17,970
I'm just gonna use the Anastasia contour kit

286
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:20,540
and just go a little bit more heavy-handed than usual.

287
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,633
Gonna grab my Morphe M405 brush and dip right there

288
00:09:22,633 --> 00:09:26,120
into the middle shade and just go right in there.

289
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,770
I used to be obsessed with going in at the absolute

290
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:31,220
most with contour and I'm really not even sure why.

291
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,680
My cheekbones and jawline are already

292
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,770
pretty defined to begin with.

293
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,140
I really just wanted that like chiseled

294
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,960
jaw line moment which really didn't even look that good.

295
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,560
It honestly just looked ridiculous but

296
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,710
we're just gonna recreate it today

297
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:42,830
for the sake of the video.

298
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:45,050
I'm gonna use even more to contour out my forehead.

299
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:47,160
I mean this honestly has not really changed that much

300
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,080
because I'm definitely still insecure about the sides of it

301
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,640
but I am a lot better at making it look softer

302
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,290
and blended while still bringing it down a little bit.

303
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:56,210
Now you're probably thinking all right James that looks

304
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:58,740
crazy, let's move on to the other side and trust me

305
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,860
I'm thinking the same thing but 2016 James was not

306
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,400
because one thing that I loved to do was after my

307
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,160
contour was already laid down I would take

308
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,120
a smaller fluffy brush and dip into an

309
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,990
even darker contour shade and just get you know

310
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,900
a little bit on there and just go right into

311
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,520
the absolute hollow of my cheek bone

312
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,080
and just put down a little bit more.

313
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,510
Okay now that was maybe a little bit much.

314
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:21,100
It never really looked that bad.

315
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,260
Now going into that same exact M405 brush.

316
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,490
Well not the same exact one but same type,

317
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:28,100
you get the point and dipping into the same color,

318
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,564
I'm gonna go in and contour the other side but just go

319
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:31,800
a little bit lighter.

320
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,070
Holding this brush right between my side burn and ear

321
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,670
and just lightly blending this downwards

322
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:39,358
in circular motions, keeping it very, very light

323
00:10:39,358 --> 00:10:40,553
and soft pulling just a little bit

324
00:10:40,553 --> 00:10:42,240
onto at the top of my forehead

325
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,178
and still underneath the jawline as well

326
00:10:44,178 --> 00:10:45,740
and then just gonna grab an M527 brush

327
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,330
and dip into this shade next door

328
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:50,030
which is a little bit more bronzy, caramel type of color

329
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:52,950
and I'm gonna use this to go lightly over top of that

330
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:55,300
contour color just to kind of blend together

331
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,730
the natural skin tone and the contour

332
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:59,660
without making it look too harsh.

333
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,960
I'm gonna quickly apply a little bit of

334
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,640
the MAC blush in the shade Peaches

335
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,270
on my Morphe E4 brush.

336
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:06,330
You guys know this blush is my all-time favorite

337
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,890
but I'm only gonna put this on the new side

338
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:10,327
because I literally hated blush

339
00:11:10,327 --> 00:11:13,280
when I first started doing makeup and never wore it.

340
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,450
I really did not know what I was missing

341
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:18,299
because this looks so pretty and youthful but oh well,

342
00:11:18,299 --> 00:11:19,250
you live and you learn I guess.

343
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,660
And now we get to move on to one of the most

344
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,030
important parts of my makeup routine

345
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,710
which is my nose contour.

346
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,886
Now if you've been following me since day one,

347
00:11:25,886 --> 00:11:28,780
I'm sorry first and foremost because my

348
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:31,430
nose used to look so bad in all my Instagram photos

349
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:33,410
because I did not know how to contour and even when I was

350
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:34,700
learning how to contour it was still

351
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,810
a really really rough process.

352
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:37,700
At first I could not figure out

353
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,730
how to do the illusion, so it just looked bad.

354
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:40,673
Then I'd learned how to do it.

355
00:11:40,673 --> 00:11:42,790
Then I learned how to Photoshop and FaceTune

356
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,770
so it looked so fake to the point where I couldn't even

357
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:47,280
breathe and now several years later I am finally at

358
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,760
a place where I'm confident with my nose

359
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,230
and how it photographs in photos.

360
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:52,080
I stopped erasing the entire thing in editing apps

361
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,390
but I definitely still do contour quite a bit

362
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:57,400
so I'm gonna grab my contouring brush and dip into the same

363
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,535
exact contouring palette firstly on the old side,

364
00:12:00,535 --> 00:12:01,580
I'm just gonna grab that same contour color

365
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:04,110
and a lot of it too and I'm just gonna go

366
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:06,859
right in on the actual edge of my nose.

367
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:08,470
Oh my god this is triggering.

368
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,700
I'm blending that shape right upwards.

369
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,460
Oh wow, this hurts.

370
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,653
This hurts a lot.

371
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,310
Now if you really like the way that your nose looks

372
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:18,700
in makeup naturally of course

373
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,230
this step doesn't really matter

374
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:22,340
but for me personally I prefer my nose to look

375
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,700
a lot more narrow so I'm gonna grab the

376
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,911
same exact contour color once again but

377
00:12:26,911 --> 00:12:28,660
instead of putting it on the absolute

378
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,890
edge of my nose and going around the bulb

379
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:33,210
which just makes it look really, really wide,

380
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:36,020
I'm gonna kind of focus this color on the top of the nose

381
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,720
bridge and pretend that the bulb tip isn't there,

382
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,690
just go right over it, kind of straightening it out,

383
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:42,523
which gives the illusion of

384
00:12:42,523 --> 00:12:44,260
a more pinched and straight nose.

385
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,380
Just gonna do it another quick spritz of setting spray

386
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,123
before I move on to baking which is the next step.

387
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:53,920
- [Man] You're kidding.

388
00:12:55,461 --> 00:12:57,168
- [Woman] That's kind of- - [James] Wow.

389
00:12:57,168 --> 00:12:58,001
(laughs)

390
00:12:58,001 --> 00:12:58,834
- [James] Are you kidding me?

391
00:12:58,834 --> 00:13:01,413
Let's try that again, a little bit of urban decay this time.

392
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:04,287
Then just going in with some more Coty Airspun powder

393
00:13:04,287 --> 00:13:06,020
and a powder puff to bake.

394
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,410
I used to put the setting powder here and just go

395
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:09,200
straight down and then I'm bringing it

396
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,950
all the way up to the back of my head,

397
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,680
I have no idea why and then right on the center of

398
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,920
the forehead and then just using the

399
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,320
Laura Mercier on the other side,

400
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,650
I'm gonna bring this powder all the way up

401
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,830
to the side of my nose to snatch it and

402
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:21,010
create that illusion and then just keeping it focused

403
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:24,620
right underneath my eyeball in this little triangular area.

404
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,830
I am very excited to tell you guys that

405
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:27,770
for the brow portion of today's video I

406
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:30,850
am actually partnering with Anastasia Beverly Hills,

407
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:34,460
that's right, to show you guys their brand new dip brow gel

408
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,380
and how I like to use it and also how I wouldn't

409
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,070
necessarily recommend using it.

410
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:40,600
If you've been around since day one you probably

411
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,900
remember the James Charles block brick Sharpie eyebrows.

412
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,940
Now at the time I loved them,

413
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,330
a few people on Instagram loved them

414
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:49,620
but for the most part they were disgusting

415
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,650
and everybody made fun of them all the time

416
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:52,630
including the Queen herself,

417
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,060
Anastasia Beverly Hills who tried to get

418
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,360
me to tweeze them all off and I literally

419
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,030
looked at her face and said absolutely not.

420
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,340
Can you say ego?

421
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,110
They had no arch to them whatsoever.

422
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,230
In fact, they almost looked like

423
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:03,830
I was frowning half the time.

424
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:06,010
They literally took up half of my forehead in thickness

425
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,990
and they also had no dimension either.

426
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:10,330
They were all just one color up straight like dark

427
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:12,460
brown almost black all the way through.

428
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,480
Three years later after a whole lot of bullying,

429
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,840
hate comments, tweezing and practice,

430
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,320
I am finally at a place where I really really

431
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,140
love my brows so let's compare the old to the new.

432
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,130
Starting off I'm gonna grab my Anastasia dip brow

433
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:25,445
in the shade dark brown and my Anastasia

434
00:14:25,445 --> 00:14:28,820
number 7B brush and I'm just going to dip in to the palette

435
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:31,010
right here and I'm going to grab quite a lot.

436
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:32,390
I usually like to take the spoolie first

437
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:34,410
and go upwards just to kind of get the shape of the brow

438
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:36,070
but I'm actually going to use the spoolie

439
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:38,590
and brush them this way to actually kind of have a flatten

440
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:40,480
them out since I've definitely tweezed

441
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,450
an arch into eyebrows over the past few years

442
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:44,400
and I'm just gonna go right in

443
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,360
starting at the front of my brow

444
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,330
which I never recommend doing any more

445
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:50,010
and just drawing a line.

446
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:52,360
This really used to happen every single day

447
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,165
and then at the very last second straight down.

448
00:14:55,165 --> 00:14:56,720
(screams)

449
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,230
Oh no.

450
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,063
I'm grabbing a little bit more

451
00:14:59,063 --> 00:15:01,023
on the same little angled brush.

452
00:15:01,023 --> 00:15:02,836
I'm just going to sketch in the tail of my eyebrow,

453
00:15:02,836 --> 00:15:03,669
going out the top,

454
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:05,710
straight down and then using whatever is left

455
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,760
which is apparently a lot.

456
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,919
Just gonna brush that right in.

457
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:11,699
Can't believe I'm doing this right now.

458
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:14,410
Ah oh my god.

459
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:16,100
That used to be on my face every day and I

460
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,730
never thought there was anything wrong with it.

461
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:19,200
As if that was enough I'm next under

462
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,210
grab the brand new Anastasia dip brow gel

463
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:23,810
and I'm gonna layer that right over the top.

464
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:26,033
Now listen I'm actually really excited to tell you guys

465
00:15:26,033 --> 00:15:28,380
about this product today because it's really, really dope.

466
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:31,360
This is a super, super pigmented, full coverage,

467
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,410
waterproof new brow gel but it can also be used

468
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:36,440
like dip brow to actually sketch in hairs

469
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,120
and actually add hairs in place.

470
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,390
I've personally been loving using this on myself

471
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:41,830
before I even draw anything in

472
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:44,100
and also on my friends that don't have as many brows hairs

473
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,620
because it does such a good job of kind of

474
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,930
sketching it in and still making it look

475
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:50,420
like a natural look but like I said this

476
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:53,506
is very, very pigmented so if you were

477
00:15:53,506 --> 00:15:56,330
going for this block eyebrow which I would not recommend,

478
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,430
you could really just go right in

479
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:59,480
and push that product right in there

480
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,940
for the original James Charles Sharpie eyebrow look.

481
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,090
Gonna grab a little bit more of the LA girl Pro concealer

482
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:06,420
and I'm just gonna squeeze that onto at the

483
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,690
back of my hand

484
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:09,450
and then just grabbing a Morphe M410 brush.

485
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:11,090
Just gonna clean that up a little bit.

486
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:13,210
Now moving on to the now side of my face,

487
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:15,350
thank God, I'm gonna grab the Anastasia brow

488
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:18,210
in the shade medium brown to start this off.

489
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,430
Using the spoolie, I'm just going to a brush all the hairs

490
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:24,730
upwards and then going right in, I'm going to lightly

491
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:26,520
start in the middle of my brow drawing

492
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,260
just tiny little hairlike strokes at the bottom

493
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,400
just to create a little bit of dimension.

494
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,610
Then just following the natural shape of my actual

495
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:37,180
brow bone and going above that going to

496
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:40,120
bring that line upwards creating an arch

497
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,090
which is flattering for human faces

498
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:43,650
and then when I get to the tail,

499
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:46,200
I'm just going to pull that line straight out

500
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,060
as opposed to straight down.

501
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,860
Going back in with the spoolie each time as well

502
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,500
to make sure that nothing ever gets too intense or dark.

503
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,490
Then I'm just going to fill in the tail.

504
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:55,870
I'm gonna clean this brow up in a second

505
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:58,570
but I'm pretty happy with the shape so far.

506
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:00,480
I'm next going to go back into the brand new

507
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,390
once again Anastasia dip brow gel

508
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,210
but this time I'm gonna use the color soft brown

509
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:06,140
which is lighter than my natural brow colors.

510
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,270
Like I said this product is very full coverage,

511
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,230
so for someone like me who likes a defined brow

512
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,960
but doesn't want to look like this,

513
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,760
I like to use a lighter shade and go in

514
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,240
super, super lightly and use this brow gel

515
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,450
to still lock everything in place

516
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:19,590
while adding a little bit of extra color

517
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:20,430
but not a whole lot.

518
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,140
What's super cool about the dip brow gel as well

519
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,940
is that it does of course set down and lock your

520
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:26,140
hairs in place but the drying time is a

521
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,270
little bit slower so I'm actually going

522
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:29,920
to take another clean brow brush.

523
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:33,130
This is the number 12 and just go right in and

524
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:35,980
use the excess dip brow gel that is in the hairs,

525
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,230
use this to lightly blend the product forward

526
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,810
into the front of the brow and then using that same brush

527
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,350
just making tiny little upwards flicks to

528
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,190
mimic the appearance of real hairs

529
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,400
in areas that are a little bit more sparse.

530
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,120
Now the new dip brow gel is smudge proof

531
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,430
so it is definitely not going anywhere

532
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,780
but I do want to go ahead and clean it up just a little bit

533
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,520
so I'm going to grab the Born This Way concealer

534
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,733
one more time and then just a rounded concealer brush

535
00:17:57,733 --> 00:17:59,270
and I'm just gonna go right in and

536
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,790
really make sure it is super clean.

537
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:03,480
All right sisters and those are both eyebrows all complete.

538
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,350
Go ahead take your screenshots.

539
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:08,110
I've handled the bullying once, I can do it again.

540
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,760
Let's just be thankful that there's been quite an

541
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,310
improvement over the last three years.

542
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,940
Here of course we have the original

543
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,470
James Charles sharpie brick eyebrows

544
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:16,890
and on the side we have the new and

545
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:19,750
improved sister snatch brow both created

546
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,440
using the brand new Anastasia dip brow gel.

547
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,400
It'll keep your brows waterproof, smudge proof

548
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,140
and looking absolutely fantastic all day long.

549
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,270
If you guys want to check this out, it is launching online

550
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:33,000
at AnastasiaBeverlyHills.com and in stores on March 7th

551
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,650
and it is only retailing for $18

552
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,070
and I totally would recommend.

553
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,910
That took plenty long enough and I never

554
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,080
want to experience that again

555
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,560
so I'm gonna move right on to the next step

556
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,780
of my routine which is of course going to

557
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,910
be the eyeshadow.

558
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:46,799
Now for eyeshadow primer, once again for the third time in

559
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,760
this video I'm gonna go to the LA Girl Pro concealer

560
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,290
in the shade of porcelain and I'm just gonna go right in

561
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:52,470
and paint this on the lid.

562
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:54,800
This is what I used to do in every single one of my makeup

563
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,507
looks and then I'm just going to blend this in

564
00:18:57,507 --> 00:18:59,030
and I'm gonna set that base in place using some more

565
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:01,730
Coty Airspun powder on a dense packing brush

566
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:02,810
and then for the other side I'm gonna grab

567
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:05,860
my Mac Paint Pot once again for a slightly different use

568
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:08,490
this time and I'm just going to lay down a generous layer of

569
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:10,400
this right over top of my eyelid and I am not going

570
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,440
to set this one with any translucent setting powder.

571
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,340
Alright you guys so to create this warm tone smoky eye

572
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,360
that I had on in the original photo, I'm of course gonna

573
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,890
grab the James Charles X Morphe iconic palette

574
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:20,810
and I'm going to basically use all of the shades

575
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:23,370
in the middle row but this video is already getting

576
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,870
very, very long so I'm gonna do the eye

577
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:26,200
portion off-camera.

578
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,000
Like I said earlier the only one thing that I didn't have

579
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,440
that much trouble with was eyeshadow.

580
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,940
Of course I've improved my techniques and

581
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,870
gotten better at blending but regardless

582
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:36,030
I've done so many different videos on

583
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:38,320
eyeshadow techniques so I'm gonna cut quickly,

584
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,420
still use the techniques that I would have used

585
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:42,180
then versus now and I'll come back and show you guys

586
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,080
the finished look and move on to the next step.

587
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,240
All right sisters we're back and I just

588
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,200
completed the eye shadow on both eyes off-camera quickly.

589
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,280
As you can see the looks are a little bit different because

590
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,750
I wanted to recreate the look exactly on this eye.

591
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:53,970
It is just a little warm tone

592
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:55,300
half cut crease moment and it looked

593
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,260
like it was a matte shade on the lid and

594
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,610
on this side, I did kind of like a

595
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:00,650
modernized version if I was to do a warm tone

596
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:02,720
half-cut crease, this is kind of what I think of,

597
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,030
just kind of orange and brownie tones

598
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,410
pulled out into a nice little wing

599
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:07,460
and then a metallic glitter right on the lid,

600
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,760
kind of messily placed just so it reflects in the light

601
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,180
and looks so incredibly stunning

602
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,170
but regardless I think both eyes with different styles

603
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,680
and techniques still look really, really beautiful.

604
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,050
That being said, the next step of both of these eye looks

605
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,590
is a winged liner.

606
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,820
Although drawing a winged liner has never

607
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,770
really changed for me, I definitely did learn a lot

608
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:24,470
about where I like to place my wing.

609
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:26,420
Probably the worst part of having a thick eyebrows

610
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,835
aside from the hate comments was the lack of

611
00:20:27,835 --> 00:20:29,800
eye shadow space that it actually gave me

612
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,330
to work with and at the time I obviously

613
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,370
didn't know this but when your eyebrows

614
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:34,750
taking up half of your eye region and

615
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,220
then are just straight downwards,

616
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,750
it really cuts off a lot of this outside

617
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:39,190
area that I would now like to use for

618
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,930
blending really big eye shadow looks.

619
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:42,420
So when it came to drawing winged

620
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,480
eyeliner when I first started,

621
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,730
I really did not have a lot of room to do it,

622
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:47,130
so the one mistake that I made all the time

623
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:50,550
was drawing my wings straight out just like that.

624
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:52,210
Now don't get me wrong drawing your wing

625
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:54,910
straight out can be a really, really helpful technique.

626
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:56,390
In fact, for my sisters that have hooded eyes,

627
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:59,490
it is the absolute best way to draw on a wing eyeliner

628
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:01,010
and make sure that it is actually seen

629
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,080
but for me as someone who doesn't have hooded eyes,

630
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,480
drawing your wing straight out could actually

631
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,610
tend to drive the eye downwards and especially

632
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,220
with a brow that doesn't have any arch

633
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,470
it's really not helping.

634
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,650
Over on this side, I'm going to pull the wing liner

635
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:13,970
much more upwards in the same shape that

636
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:15,470
I drew my eye shadow in.

637
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,920
Just like the eye shadow it is two completely

638
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,330
different techniques and styles.

639
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:21,070
I do honestly think that they both look really, really good.

640
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:23,300
This wing turned out better than I honestly anticipated

641
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,240
but I definitely still prefer a wing that is

642
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,480
much more pulled up.

643
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,323
I just think it really makes the eye

644
00:21:27,323 --> 00:21:29,400
look so much more snatch and gives it life

645
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,580
whereas this eye just kind of looks a little bit

646
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,560
more dead and basic in my opinion.

647
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,350
Moving right along, I'm gonna give both sides of

648
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:36,100
my lashes a nice curl and then going to

649
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,840
apply a heavy coat of the Benefit Roller Lash mascara

650
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,650
on the old side and then on the newer side

651
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:43,360
I'm gonna add a light coat of the Mac Extended Play mascara.

652
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,240
Now as for lashes, I'm zooming in on this photo

653
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,380
and it looks like I don't have any on.

654
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,590
I'm not exactly sure but I do naturally have

655
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:52,380
pretty long and thick eyelashes to begin with

656
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,190
so I honestly might not have been wearing them

657
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:55,750
considering when I first started doing makeup

658
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:56,880
I literally could not put on lashes

659
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,560
without gluing my eyes shut so I guess I'm gonna be skipping

660
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,790
that on this side of my face today

661
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:03,120
but on this side I'm gonna pop on the Lilly Lashes

662
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,700
Miami So Extra.

663
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,490
Use code James chains for 15% off your purchase.

664
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:08,490
Alright guys those are both eyes all complete

665
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:13,490
looking beautiful, looking fabulous on both sides, kind of.

666
00:22:13,633 --> 00:22:15,840
We're going to go ahead and dust off the bake

667
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,370
because this powder has been sitting on my face

668
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:20,660
for literally like too long now so let's do that.

669
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:23,250
It is now time to get our glow on and what is so crazy

670
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,121
is that we're actually going to be using

671
00:22:25,121 --> 00:22:26,710
the same product on both sides of my

672
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:29,100
face and that is the Anastasia Beverly Hills

673
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,830
So Hollywood Illuminator.

674
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:32,710
This is literally the first highlighter that

675
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:35,730
I ever bought and I have stuck with it since day one.

676
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:36,660
I love this color.

677
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,070
It works so well on my skin tone.

678
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:40,100
I still reach for it every single time I do my makeup.

679
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,470
Clearly as you can see she's seen better days,

680
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,050
but she's still working good as new.

681
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:46,090
A lot of you guys know when it comes to applying a

682
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:48,370
highlighter or metallic shadow using a tiny little bit

683
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:50,380
of setting spray can really make a color pop.

684
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,010
Now when I used to apply highlighter

685
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:53,500
a very very long time ago I would do

686
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,170
what you're not supposed to do which is

687
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:57,410
basically drench the brush first,

688
00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:01,670
this is a Morphe M501, and then dip into the pan.

689
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:04,560
Well this does apply a very very blinding and metallic glow,

690
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,630
this can negatively affect the formula in the pan

691
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:07,720
because you're basically adding a

692
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,842
setting spray and water to the mixture

693
00:23:09,842 --> 00:23:10,800
where it was not intended to be.

694
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,160
Also when you apply highlighter wet,

695
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,990
it can look really really beautiful but it can

696
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:15,600
also look super streaky.

697
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,710
This might not look that bad on camera but in person

698
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:19,850
this looks absolutely ridiculous.

699
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:22,140
I know everybody loves a good glow and trust me

700
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:25,420
so do I but it just is not flattering.

701
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,910
I also used to shoot my Instagram photos

702
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,440
in a basement using only a ring light

703
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,250
so I used to have a major problem actually

704
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,250
getting my highlight to reflect for some reason

705
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,470
and I think that's probably why I went so ham

706
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:36,100
on the setting spray and highlighter before

707
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,797
but regardless let's go in and highlight the other side

708
00:23:37,797 --> 00:23:40,090
and make it look nice and pretty the way I do it now.

709
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:41,590
This time around I'm gonna grab my setting spray

710
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,840
but instead of spraying my brush first

711
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,690
I'm gonna actually give my

712
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,710
face a good up little spritz.

713
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:46,770
Once again to kind of melt all the

714
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:49,530
powders together but also to give us some wetness

715
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:50,580
for the highlighter to stick to

716
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:53,240
and I'm going to be using the M504 brush this time

717
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,200
which is a little bit smaller than the M501

718
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,600
I'm gonna dip into the once again So Hollywood illuminator

719
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,390
getting quite a lot on there and I'm just gonna apply this

720
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:03,350
right on the top of the cheekbone

721
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:05,680
keeping it most intense right here

722
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,690
and then just using any excess that's left on the brush

723
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:08,530
to blend it out.

724
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,096
Much prettier in my opinion.

725
00:24:10,096 --> 00:24:11,370
And then I'm just gonna grab a little bit of Face

726
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:13,000
from my palette and add that right on top.

727
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,485
Oh that just looks so pretty

728
00:24:14,485 --> 00:24:15,400
and the little of sparkle glitter.

729
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,120
Grabbing a little bit more Face on that same brush,

730
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,750
I'm just gonna tap it off so there's not a whole lot

731
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,700
of product on there and I'm gonna pop a little bit

732
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:24,040
right above my brow bone for subtle little highlight here

733
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,950
and then also a little bit on the top of the chin as well.

734
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:28,340
My nose highlight has never changed,

735
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,603
just grabbing the M431 and a little bit more face on the end

736
00:24:30,603 --> 00:24:33,350
of that brush, I'm just gonna draw a straight line

737
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:35,980
right down the center and then a tiny little dot

738
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:38,480
at the tip for my little explanation point.

739
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,555
Alright you guys, with our highlighter being on and glowing

740
00:24:41,555 --> 00:24:42,930
to the Gods we can go ahead and move on

741
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:45,280
to our last step which is going to be the lips.

742
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,810
So for both sides of the lips today,

743
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:48,470
I'm going to using the Ofra liquid lipstick

744
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:49,500
in the shade Venice.

745
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,810
This is another one of those products that I've

746
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:52,300
been using a since day one and literally

747
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,830
have not find a better version of.

748
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:56,270
I really, really like the formula of the Ofra liquid lips.

749
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:57,950
Now since this photo was taken a few years ago,

750
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:59,840
a full disclosure I have had my lips done.

751
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,570
That was a personal choice by me.

752
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:03,560
It has been well over a year since I actually did them

753
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,710
though so they are definitely going way, way down

754
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,970
but they are still nowhere near as small

755
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:09,750
as they were in this picture so

756
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,030
I'm just gonna go ahead and apply this lipstick

757
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:13,480
to the old make up side and I'm not going to over line

758
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,480
literally in the slightest bit and then on the newer

759
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,220
side I'm gonna go just slightly outside

760
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,200
of my lip line for a more voluminous look

761
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,623
and we are finally finishing off of both sides

762
00:25:20,623 --> 00:25:23,160
with a little bit of sister setting spray

763
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,396
to lock it all in place.

764
00:25:25,396 --> 00:25:27,802
(windchimes)

765
00:25:27,802 --> 00:25:30,385
(upbeat music)

766
00:25:39,652 --> 00:25:40,730
All right sisters, then I think that is my

767
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:44,520
how I did my makeup then versus now look all complete.

768
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,800
Oh my gosh you guys it was so much fun

769
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,540
taking a trip down memory lane and reminiscing

770
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,910
all the old products, tips and techniques that I used

771
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:52,150
to use a few years ago.

772
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:54,480
It's only been three short years but I am so proud of

773
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,840
the progress that I've made from this to this.

774
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,800
I do think both sides still look beautiful in their own way

775
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,110
but I can also happily admit that three years ago,

776
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:04,090
I came to the beauty industry with a whole lot of passion

777
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:06,500
but also a whole lot of ego as well.

778
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,060
I truly thought I was the best, the best

779
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:10,790
that I could not get any better but boy was I wrong.

780
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:12,500
Practice really really does make perfect

781
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,590
and I am so grateful for every single one you guys out there

782
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:16,820
who saw potential stuck by me and also left

783
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,520
constructive criticism and that goes for all

784
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,830
my artist friends out there as well.

785
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,589
Thank you guys for always teaching me new tips and

786
00:26:21,589 --> 00:26:23,980
techniques that I get to integrate into my routine

787
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:26,150
and just overall thank you for inspiring me and

788
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:27,843
being really cool friends.

789
00:26:27,843 --> 00:26:29,940
I had so much fun doing this video today and seeing

790
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,330
how my style has changed and what's even

791
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:33,150
so crazy is that I'm probably gonna look back

792
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:35,090
at this video in five years and be like

793
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:36,990
ew this looks absolutely disgusting but

794
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:38,450
regardless I hope that all of you

795
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:40,010
sisters will still be here in the long run

796
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:41,890
and we can look back and laugh together

797
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:42,840
and I cannot wait to see where

798
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,320
