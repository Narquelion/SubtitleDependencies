when I came in and I gave you a hug yeah

122
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:18,709

123
00:04:17,419 --> 00:04:20,090
height that I pictured you to be and

124
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:21,650
you're the builds like even like your

125
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:24,530
shoulder width you're more of like a

126
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:26,000
slim and on the shorter side like I

127
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:28,490
pictured you being around between like

128
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,380
five six and like five nine and being

129
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:32,120
like kind of a slimmer build don't think

130
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:33,889
that's just how I picture five exactly

131
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,680
where I picture you to have like really

132
00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:39,380
good hair and brows yeah like hey star

133
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,820

134
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,979
know you're you're pretty into you're

135
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:45,139
like full glam yeah so I picture to have

136
00:04:42,979 --> 00:04:47,660
like good strong cheekbones strong brows

137
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:50,120
I would picture you to have like a very

138
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:51,770
symmetrical face I've been told that I

139
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,419
do have that yeah at least if I don't my

140
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:55,039
face doing it to look like a song I

141
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:57,200
picture you to be like a deeper skin

142
00:04:55,039 --> 00:04:59,240
tone than me but still Caucasian no I

143
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:01,430
don't picture to have freckles I have a

144
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,110
few actually I wish I had a freckle

145
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,650
freckles I have beauty marks all over my

146
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:05,180
face

147
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:06,410
they're not like a nicely cutely place

148
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,820
right on the bridge of the nose which is

149
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:09,289
where I wish they were I have freckles

150
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:11,630
there yeah you get bossed

151
00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:13,729
and then I pictured up brown eyes yes

152
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:15,169
Wow yeah I'm impressed with my own self

153
00:05:13,729 --> 00:05:17,150
yeah

154
00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:18,380
no Molly that's awesome this might be a

155
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,750
workers but you want to feel my face

156
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:23,030
before you began okay first before we do

157
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:25,039
that yeah I will say that like typically

158
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:26,750
blind people don't feel faces so if

159
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,789
somebody like me wants to like meet a

160
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,990
lot if you meet me in person if you meet

161
00:05:28,789 --> 00:05:31,250
a blind person in person don't be like

162
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:33,590
what you want to feel my face they

163
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:35,539
didn't like no no but in this situation

164
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:37,220
it does make more sense yes I will be

165
00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:38,870
doing a lot of your makeup with my hands

166
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:41,270
that's because that's how I do my makeup

167
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:43,370
because I can feel what I'm doing yeah

168
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:44,600
is a brush puts a barrier between what

169
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:46,310
I'm doing right so of course those

170
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,110
things that I'm gonna use brushes for

171
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:49,940
like I'm not gonna like try to contour

172
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:51,590
with my finger you know but like a lot

173
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:53,510
of them the other stuff I do like to use

174
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:54,710
my fingers to apply stuff right because

175
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:56,000
it does give me a good feel but like

176
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:57,620
yeah I don't know what face shape you

177
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,630
have I don't know you know that kind of

178
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:01,190
stuff so we're going makeup it changes

179
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:03,020
things right so if this is a pore

180
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:05,510
filling primer it's gonna be very slick

181
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:06,590
yep yep thick and slick Oh sister

182
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:09,070
definitely needs some more help

183

strong jaw line which I feel like is

for you you do you record every single

199
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,660
day I do but because you lost your

200
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:43,250
vision when you were 14 14 you don't

201
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:45,410
remember what you look like I don't but

202
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:47,090
it's insane to me yes it's one of the

203
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:48,260
like most frustrating things like most

204
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:50,180
of my blind friends when you talk to

205
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:51,830
them like it sounds so narcissistic like

206
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,240
if you could see something you'd want to

207
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:54,650
see your family your friends and

208
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,870
yourself with you just want to see face

209
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:58,730
it yes like you missed so much when you

210
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:00,350
can't see they say more than 90% of

211
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:01,490
communication is nonverbal of course

212
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:03,320
it's a tone of voice but it's also

213
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:05,000
facial expression body language all of

214
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,170
that stuff means a lot it's hard not

215
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,550
being able to see other people when

216
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:09,170
you're communicating with them it's hard

217
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:10,790
not to see yourself it can be difficult

218
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:12,320
especially when you're like working in

219
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:14,300
the entertainment business you're living

220
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:16,100
in LA with all the pretty people and

221
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,810
it's very much a place pay someone and

222
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,220
you get so many comments cuz like of

223
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:20,420
course I work in social media so I get

224
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,710
like tons of comments about my

225
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:23,960
appearance it can really screw with your

226
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:25,640
head yeah but I really try to not think

227
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,470
about it and just like be positive

228
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:29,480
because it's really easy to focus on the

229
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:31,190
negative parts of being blind yeah but

230
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:33,170
there's also positives that come with it

231
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:35,660
no they're not as easy they're not as

232
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:37,520
obvious but I think if I live with like

233
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:39,249
thinking of the sad stuff that's no way

234
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,989
to a point right you just sit back and

235
00:07:39,249 --> 00:07:42,699
all the time like I can't look like that

236
00:07:40,989 --> 00:07:45,369
no okay I don't wanna poke you in the

237
00:07:42,699 --> 00:07:46,509
eye no worries perfect

238
00:07:45,369 --> 00:07:48,009
I was watching everybody oh that you did

239
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:49,989
was change yeah you don't really have a

240
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:52,059
lot of recollection of watching anything

241
00:07:49,989 --> 00:07:55,449
yeah so like visual memory doesn't

242
00:07:52,059 --> 00:07:59,079
really last my mom her best friend

243
00:07:55,449 --> 00:08:01,299
actual boss is blind he lost his vision

244
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:02,889
on his 11th birthday on his 11th

245
00:08:01,299 --> 00:08:04,149
birthday yeah what again absolutely

246
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:05,319
horrible right obviously I'm very

247
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:06,609
ignorant to the topic I know a little

248
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:08,319
bit but I write pretty much I know to

249
00:08:06,609 --> 00:08:10,329
the topic of blindness as I'm so excited

250
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,189
to learn more from you today he has I

251
00:08:10,329 --> 00:08:14,679
wanted to do is 11 he is much older now

252
00:08:12,189 --> 00:08:16,419
but he can remember a lot of things I

253
00:08:14,679 --> 00:08:18,549
wonder if he actually remembers or if

254
00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:20,439
it's his brain well I will tell you Fred

255
00:08:18,549 --> 00:08:21,909
he grew up in New York City he still

256
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:23,589
works there all the time for his job and

257
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:24,909
what's insane to me is obviously when

258
00:08:23,589 --> 00:08:27,789
you're blind a lot of your other senses

259
00:08:24,909 --> 00:08:29,499
are of course you rely on the more yeah

260
00:08:27,789 --> 00:08:31,419
we will be in the taxi together in New

261
00:08:29,499 --> 00:08:33,430
York and he'll be like oh my God look at

262
00:08:31,419 --> 00:08:35,289
that building over there on 56th and

263
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:36,639
Madison it's so beautiful and I'll look

264
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:37,930
over bleak oh yeah that is a pretty

265
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:39,309
building they don't remember oh my god

266
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:40,719
he has no idea what he's looking at or

267
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:41,800
he'll be like oh yeah look at there's a

268
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,750
subway station right there like that's

269
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:46,209
where we need to go so he can't see I

270
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:48,189
think I have that too like I have mental

271
00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:50,170
maps of everything around me take me to

272
00:08:48,189 --> 00:08:51,490
a shopping mall I know where every store

273
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:52,720
is located in the mall and I can like

274
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:54,610
walk directly there like it's like a

275
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,740
mental mapping system like it's a coping

276
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:58,120
mechanism you know we have to remember

277
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:59,620
where everything is and I'll talk about

278
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,000
things like a lot of people come and be

279
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:02,620
like well how does she know like that's

280
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,879
her favorite foundation if she can't see

281
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,949
how it looks like it's about how it

282
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:07,779
feels or like talked about something as

283
00:09:05,949 --> 00:09:09,399
if I know how beautiful is but never

284
00:09:07,779 --> 00:09:10,509
like how does she talk about it like she

285
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:11,769
knows how beautiful it is I'm like well

286
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:16,600
people describe it to me yeah I'm gonna

287
00:09:11,769 --> 00:09:17,950
find a fluffy brush to set you with you

288
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,900

289
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:22,730
I like the fluffy soft ones oh yeah yeah

290
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,290
that's a good one is it dual fibre yes

291
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:27,110
it feels like a dual five yesterday's

292
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:28,670
laura mercier yes ma'am I did this like

293
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:30,260
series on my channel where I started

294
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:32,180
trying beauty products and beauty hacks

295
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:33,470
that I was too scared to try oh my god

296
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,520
and one of them was loose setting

297
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:35,690
powders that's thing that you've been

298
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,790
afraid to turn I was always afraid

299
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:39,170
because like loose powder and blindness

300
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:41,360
sounds like a dangerous combination

301
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:43,580
there's two base hasn't loose powder

302
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,350
it's their peach powder and I literally

303
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:47,540
love it because I thought smell like pee

304
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:48,740
it tastes like peach - oh my god like

305
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:50,150

like land on my tongue I'm like you and

307
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,790
then I'm like I actually taste something

308
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:55,760
you're gonna need to show me that

309
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:58,280
product i under % well have I gotten any

310
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,860
no nope not much oh I just talked

311
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:03,380
product over blind girl problems are you

312
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:04,880
able to visualize things yeah it's

313
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:06,950
interesting it's almost like when people

314
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,020
describe things because I have like a

315
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:11,450
history with sight yeah even though I

316
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:13,280
can't like pull up an image when you

317
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:15,770
describe stuff it still means something

318
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:18,260
okay more so than it would to somebody

319
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:19,940
who's never seen them right so if I said

320
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:22,100
like oh you're using a white handled

321
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:23,810
duo-fiber coffee bar so it's like a

322
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:26,840
far-off it's almost like a memory like

323
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:29,600
yeah I can still remember green purple

324
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:31,370
and blue okay guys I see them all the

325
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,500
time I have what's called like I called

326
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:36,350
him fireworks and basically I see

327
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,490
flashing lights 24/7 and they're only

328
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:38,510
blue green and purple

329
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:40,100
but he said purple is your favorite

330
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:41,600
color purple is my favorite color was

331
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,130
the last favorite color I after had when

332
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,680
I was going blind so it's just like

333
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:47,360
remained my favorite color oh my god all

334
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,860
right I'm gonna bronze you one of the

335
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,690
reasons I love Too Faced so much is cuz

336
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:52,820
their products are scented it's like I

337
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:54,650
can enjoy it you know like I can't see

338
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:56,450
it but I can smell it and it's like a

339
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:57,980
way for me to enjoy makeup so this would

340
00:10:56,450 --> 00:11:00,080
be like the Davos question ever but

341
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:03,680
since you don't have your site what

342
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:04,400
would be your favorite scents um that's

343
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,340
a stupid question

344
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:09,110
it's not um I say my hands are my eyes

345
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:10,700
yeah I'm always going around touching

346
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:13,580
everything yeah except people's faces

347
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:15,710
and so that's like definitely one of the

348
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:17,870
senses I rely on the most I'm a nun

349
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:19,670
hearing yeah as I say my mom's boss he

350
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:21,350
carries on a walking cane and he can

351
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:22,420
slam his cane on the ground as soon as

352
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:23,769
he walks into a ring

353
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:26,170
you like a million facts about the room

354
00:11:23,769 --> 00:11:27,670
yeah passive echolocation so I'm gonna

355
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:29,470
bless you now I've never used this blush

356
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:31,120
before so I hope I'm not going to like

357
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:32,529
heavy-handed with it but that's what

358
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,630
happens when you can't see the colors

359
00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:37,630
whenever I got new makeup on like Wars

360
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:39,070
now the other son goes and I always like

361
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,810

lightest to darkest no I can't stand why

377
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:16,209
do brands just randomly willy-nilly go

378
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:17,649
throwing colors into a curry and so

379
00:12:16,209 --> 00:12:19,209
annoying it would make more sense not

380
00:12:17,649 --> 00:12:21,459
even just for blind people but for like

381
00:12:19,209 --> 00:12:24,639
beginners of makeup yeah if all makeup

you when I moved out yeah I was 18 I

388
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:39,820
lived on my own from 18 to 20 21

389
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:41,500
I am very people relying like me I need

390
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:43,660
to be around people at all times X

391
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:45,760
obviously yes yeah obviously not to see

392
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:47,620
but just like to feel like a presence

393
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,149
around you yeah yeah what do you say the

394
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:51,399
gala would be like that presence for you

395
00:12:49,149 --> 00:12:53,529
or if C was the dog I had at the time

396
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:54,699
okay we live together she was great like

397
00:12:53,529 --> 00:12:57,190
she would get me out going to the dog

398
00:12:54,699 --> 00:12:58,660
park with her and I you know I had a

399
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:59,529
full-time assistant at the time as a

400
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,910
motivational speaker

401
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:02,890
I still have loved all but that was like

402
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:04,930
my full-time job was notational speaking

403
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:06,069
so I was like touring law and I had a

404
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:07,449
full-time assistant he would travel

405
00:13:06,069 --> 00:13:09,040
everywhere with me so my parents lived

406
00:13:07,449 --> 00:13:10,720
close by and like would come visit my

407
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,579
dad's office was like 15 minutes away so

408
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,490
yeah it made like living alone

409
00:13:12,579 --> 00:13:17,019
more more company versus like now I love

410
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:19,420
six-hour flight away from my family

411
00:13:17,019 --> 00:13:21,560
which is obviously like yeah a lot what

412
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:24,330
have you

413
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:25,830
you have to come to my place how do you

414
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:27,420
like I wanted so far I love it I

415
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:28,890
honestly do I told my parents when I was

416
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:30,390
five that I was gonna move to LA really

417
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:32,520
like this is the same all I became a

418
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:35,339
youtuber so I moved to LA like know it

419
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:37,230
really like has always been my dream I

420
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:38,940
always say I want to fulfill like all of

421
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:40,500
sighted molly's dreams you know I want

422
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:42,930
to show myself and other people that

423
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,550
going blind doesn't have to change my

424
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:46,230
life path and you have to change

425
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:48,570
everything it changes things for sure

426
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:50,070
but like it doesn't have to be like that

427
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,790
not to make it negative or anything but

428
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:53,250
like what would you say has been the

429
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:54,570
hardest part about not being sighted

430
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,790
you know I dealt with a lot of bullying

431
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:58,649
when it happened which was really hard I

432
00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:00,390
lost all my friends and like went from

433
00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:02,370
being like pretty popular to having just

434
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:04,440
not only having nobody but being

435
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:06,570
tormented and know what's really really

436
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:08,160
hard oh my god I can't even more because

437
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:09,480
I love my life please do that's what I

438
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,250
talk about a lot with my speaking as

439
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,600
like mental health and bullying and

440
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,430
accessibility and accepting diversity

441
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,510
and that kind of thing because you know

442
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:17,399
I think a lot of people are very

443
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:18,600
ignorant about blindness and disability

444
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:20,070
in general it's not their fault it's

445
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,390
because society's been taught that it

446
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:22,920
should be this elephant in the room and

447
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:24,390
that we're not allowed to talk don't

448
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:26,670
look don't stare don't ask questions

449
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:28,050
right ignore them you know that's not

450
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:29,339
how I think it should be we should be

451
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:30,959
educated and talking about it from a

452
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:32,970
young age we should have disabled

453
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,470
characters in children's books and in TV

454
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:36,209
shows and it shouldn't be like the sole

455
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:38,190
focus of the character all the time no

456
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:40,110
which is unfortunately how it is we're

457
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:41,940
rarely representative medium when we are

458
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:43,320
were represented very poorly I grew up

459
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,670
wanting to be an actress and a model but

460
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,560
I went blind I was like it's never gonna

461
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:48,600
happen yeah I realized like you know

462
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,950
maybe traditional media is gonna be

463
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,420
really hard for me to work in but like I

464
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:53,940
can carve my own path I can represent

465
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:56,339
myself I can represent my community yeah

466
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:57,270
and make content myself I'm Papa would

467
00:14:56,339 --> 00:14:58,830
you say YouTube has done the best

468
00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:01,140
platform for you to do that oh my god

469
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:02,520
absolutely I love YouTube YouTube was

470
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,959
like a huge part of my journey to

471
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,850
recovery and my journey to finding

472
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:07,860
confidence and self love after blindness

473
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:09,900
and so the fact that I can now use

474
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:11,520
YouTube to help other people it's so

475
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:13,620
remarkable yeah do you have a lot of

476
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:15,000
blind followers I do I definitely have a

477
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:16,860
lot of disabled followers a lot of blind

478
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,880
followers I have a lot of parents of

479
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,950
kids who are disabled

480
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,899
yeah our teachers but of course I also

481
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:24,570
have like a ton of able-bodied people

482
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:25,120
know nothing about disability and come

483
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:27,939
and learn

484
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,860
and join the conversation and I love

485
00:15:27,939 --> 00:15:32,050
that I love changing people's opinions

486
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:33,459
and like breaking stereotypes so many

487
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:35,649
people will initially come to my channel

488
00:15:33,459 --> 00:15:37,029
and be like oh she's faking it cuz XYZ

489
00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:39,009
like all of these stereotypes that I

490
00:15:37,029 --> 00:15:40,930
don't fit but but then they watch enough

491
00:15:39,009 --> 00:15:43,269
of my videos and they realize why

492
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:45,430
they're misinformed why they hold these

493
00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:46,329
ideas about disability and why they

494
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:48,819
might be wrong

495
00:15:46,329 --> 00:15:50,499
yeah and actually like on the process of

496
00:15:48,819 --> 00:15:51,970
like trying to catch me alive they

497
00:15:50,499 --> 00:15:53,170
educate that it's all crazy to me why

498
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:55,449
would you ever do that there's like

499
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:57,639
those few rare random people who have

500
00:15:55,449 --> 00:15:59,050
like faked cancer or like that guy young

501
00:15:57,639 --> 00:16:00,579
[ __ ] who like pretended to be in a

502
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:02,170
wheelchair and then stood up the end of

503
00:16:00,579 --> 00:16:05,050
a concert like there's those weird

504
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:06,490
bizarre random for a few people but they

505
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:08,019
get attention when they do it and it

506
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:10,180
gets media attention when the story

507
00:16:08,019 --> 00:16:11,439
comes out that like now everybody who

508
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:13,509
has cancer it's like they have to prove

509
00:16:11,439 --> 00:16:15,249
it once they buzz it on the internet and

510
00:16:13,509 --> 00:16:16,540
everybody was disabled we have to like

511
00:16:15,249 --> 00:16:18,910
prove it but that's not our

512
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:20,559
responsibility you know as it should be

513
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:21,069
it's the one bad person that ruins that

514
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:22,899
for everybody

515
00:16:21,069 --> 00:16:24,129
exactly that sucks I think there's a lot

516
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:26,319
of that in the beauty community - like a

517
00:16:24,129 --> 00:16:27,309
lot of us have had sister scandals and

518
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:29,290
yes about the beauty community

519
00:16:27,309 --> 00:16:31,990
definitely has a very like bad and like

520
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:33,999
dramatic rap but well I feel like it

521
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:35,860
sucks but like I'm part of the problem

522
00:16:33,999 --> 00:16:37,420
of that and decides that I definitely

523
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,679
had a messy past growing up but I've

524
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:40,329
never totally clean it up and I know a

525
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:43,029
lot of other people as well but that's

526
00:16:40,329 --> 00:16:43,870
you know young like making mistakes is a

527
00:16:43,029 --> 00:16:46,269
part of the journey

528
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:47,709
you know you learned so much I mean I'm

529
00:16:46,269 --> 00:16:49,389
such a different person now than I was

530
00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:51,279
at 20 and I thought I was like mature

531
00:16:49,389 --> 00:16:52,929
and knew it all at 20 you know you grow

532
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,429
and that's a part of it yeah and

533
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:55,749
unfortunately like for somebody like you

534
00:16:54,429 --> 00:16:57,699
who started in social media very young

535
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:59,529
you had to grow up publicly and you like

536
00:16:57,699 --> 00:17:01,269
people have to see your mistakes we all

537
00:16:59,529 --> 00:17:03,040
make mistakes and a lot of us are lucky

538
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:04,839
enough that we do it privately so I

539
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,789
don't understand like people who fill in

540
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:08,709
eyes you know young celebrities and

541
00:17:06,789 --> 00:17:10,089
stars who make mistakes because it's

542
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:11,589
like yeah you did that too you know and

543
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:13,360
you can't even imagine the pressure

544
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:14,500
right that these people are under you'll

545
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,740
have less brow bone than me

546
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:19,929
really yeah I have more you have higher

547
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:21,909
yeah eyebrows are not very arched and

548
00:17:19,929 --> 00:17:23,860
they're like more course it's not just a

549
00:17:21,909 --> 00:17:25,240
boy thing or is that like a you think I

550
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:27,279
guess it's a little bit of a boy thing

551
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,559
also my brows have underwent a major

552
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:31,179
transformation if you were to meet me

553
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:32,440
two years ago and he had the square

554
00:17:31,179 --> 00:17:34,510
Brown yeah

555
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,680
if you were to meet me two years ago and

556
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:39,910
feel my brows they literally would have

557
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:42,400
been down here interesting and scary is

558
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:44,770
what it was and I feel like oh all the

559
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,060
photos are so public there yeah

560
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:47,710
they're all there they are all

561
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:49,150
documented and likely I don't get the

562
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:50,530
most hate comments ever and I think oh

563
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:51,970
my god people are so mean I love my

564
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:53,560
brows and then looking back at it out

565
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:55,300
you're like why did I love that I was

566
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,800
like thank you all for leaving me those

567
00:17:55,300 --> 00:18:01,030
tough that's all my eyebrows because it

568
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:03,250
worked my eyebrows so now I learned I

569
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:04,510
did another a little bit more arts but I

570
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,460
still don't have that big of a brow bone

571
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:08,320
yeah it's so interesting again like face

572
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,880
structures cuz I just don't think about

573
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,950
it yeah you know I don't think about

574
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,390
faces looking different yeah what do you

575
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,750
really like about doing different makeup

576
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:15,520
looks

577
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:17,080
I mean it's art you know it's art that I

578
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,300
can experience because I'm feeling it

579
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:21,400
yeah versus so much art in the world

580
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:24,640
I can't experience I can't see I can't

581
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:26,710
enjoy so for me that's what I love yeah

582
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,600
you need to explain to them exactly what

583
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:30,400
you're explaining to me about eyeshadow

584
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:33,160
right were you forgetting that so when I

585
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,480
get a new palette I memorize where the

586
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,770
shadows are so you can probably tell

587
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,240
which ones I love I love this shadow

588
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:38,980
right here which is like a matte kind of

589
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,810
warm tone brown I love this color which

590
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:42,340
is a matte peachy kind of shade

591
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:45,370
I love this color which is like a really

592
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:47,260
shimmery coppery almost I think I love

593
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:49,480
these two shades right here I do not

594
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:51,190
show you a lot which i think is like a

595
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,770
peach shade not as shimmery as this one

596
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:55,780
yeah but in a kind of deeper peach color

597
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:57,550
I love these two for like a really fun

598
00:18:55,780 --> 00:19:00,490
beachy look huh which are kind of more

599
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:02,410
brights like corals yeah and then of

600
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:03,610
course like this is a great highlight or

601
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:06,130
I'll do this on the lid which is like a

602
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:07,750
light gold yes I usually do that like as

603
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:09,310
a highlight if I want to brow bone

604
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:11,800
highlight that is the craziest thing the

605
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:13,720
most amazing yeah it's all memorized why

606
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,310
do I do your makeup like I think I want

607
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,780
to try to go through and a shadow

608
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:18,490
palette and see if I have any of the

609
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:21,040
memorize I think I might be able to do

610
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:22,810
it probably oh my god that that is so

611
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,460
cool to me when you can't see you just

612
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:25,780
figure it out all the time I'll comment

613
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:27,280
on my videos and though I don't know how

614
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:28,900
she does it like I could never be blind

615
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,910
if I went blind I would kill myself I'm

616
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:32,170
like okay sure there's like times when I

617
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:33,400
felt like that when I first went blind

618
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:34,990
and was being bullied and dealing with

619
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:38,650
depression guys purple on it

620
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:40,930
oh oh I clean your brushes I'm sorry

621
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:42,700
wouldn't life hands you a situation that

622
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:44,560
didn't expect you just figure it out

623
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:46,000
yeah you know just to I'm gonna actually

624
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:48,190
go back to the concealer I just use this

625
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,160
as primer perfect hi we're out of budget

626
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:53,500
always who needs 50 million products you

627
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:55,960

628
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,620

629
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,720
land

630
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:00,940
I left Hart mm-hmm I love Too Faced

631
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,980
mm-hmm I love Mac since it's what like

632
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:06,340
brought me into the makeup world when I

633
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:07,810
was 12 13 and told my mom that I really

634
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,920
wanted to start wearing makeup she felt

635
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:10,270
like I would probably end up in a

636
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,620
disaster if she just like bought me a

637
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:13,630
bunch of drugstore makeup and like

638
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:15,790
handed it to me and was like no and so

639
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:17,800
she took me to a Mac counter yeah um and

640
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:20,110
had them pick out all the shades for me

641
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,940
and she had them teach me like which

642
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:23,800
product goes where and she bought it all

643
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:26,140
for me and then I figured it out and I

644
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:28,090
would practice and I loved it and then

645
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:29,350
every birthday and every Christmas she

646
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:30,550
would bring me to get a new look as I

647
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:32,800
got older and that's how I started

648
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:34,660
collecting so for about five years of

649
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,980
makeup loving Mac was like the only

650
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:37,780
brand that existed to me and I was like

651
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:39,040
Sephora what yeah well Mac was the only

652
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:41,080
brand that kind of existed for most

653
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,910
beginner makeup offers a long time yeah

654
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,530
I took me a long time you know once I

655
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:45,940
was like deep into the beauty YouTube

656
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:47,470
world and I was like okay I need to

657
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:48,760
start trying some of these I think like

658
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:50,200
probably the first product I bought

659
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:52,750
outside of Mac was like Make Up For Ever

660
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:54,730
HD which then ended up becoming like my

661
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:56,140
holy grail foundation that was my holy

662
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:58,780
grail foundation when I first started it

663
00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:00,550
like still is I love that oh my god I

664
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:02,440
love that I just love the texture like

665
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:04,510
it really sinks seamlessly into your

666
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:06,010
skin you know I agree so the beauty guru

667
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:08,080
world kind of really got you into makeup

668
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:10,630
that absolutely like I loved makeup

669
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,880

670
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:14,650
like the obsession went so deep which

671
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,310
I'm sure so many people watching this

672
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,990
could relate to

673
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:19,300
yeah that's literally how I started

674
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:20,230
screws the budget yeah I started

675
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,610
watching like Jacqueline Hale

community right now and I always love

691
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:55,050

692
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:57,150
what I think all right whose content

693
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:58,650
really inspires me yeah that's why I

694
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:00,660
feel like I go outside of the beauty

695
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:02,970
community for like people inspire me you

696
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:08,960

thanks Juvederm okay rub your lips

699
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:17,340
together now you have to try to do your

700
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:18,300
own mascara don't let me go mad so you

701
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:23,880
can do it easily

702
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:25,680
okay Loxley oh I always try to go like

703
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,150
into the little baby lashes in my inner

704
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,410
corner and that's when I hit my nose I

705
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:31,440
think I still do have a slight advantage

706
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:33,570
because I can see the wand right not

707
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,940
like very well but it's like it's blurry

708
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:38,040
I'm legally blind clearly I can still

709
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:39,720
see but like I think by optometrist

710
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:42,270
standard so you can't drive a car then

711
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,470
cuz you know what I've got okay so when

712
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:45,090
you don't have your glasses or contacts

713
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:46,860
in here oh no I would crash in three

714
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:48,120
seconds yeah yeah my vision has always

715
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,750
been bad but it just keeps getting worse

716
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,190
and worse

717
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:52,020
just like blindness like blindness is a

718
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:54,270
spectrum we all have like different

719
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:55,500
different amount of vision left maybe

720
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:57,990
one day we'll be able to do a full blind

721
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:59,730
collapse again you'll be my fellow blind

722
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:01,590
