literally no idea

77
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,159
okay so while i'm on the topic of my

78
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,119
favorite hermanas i thought it would be

79
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,560
cute to dm miss

80
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,239
rosalia oh my god i've seen her live

81
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,640
before and her performances on stage are

82
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,160
so

83
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,039
like crazy and beautiful so she

84
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,080
definitely has to have a powder that

85
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,840
locks her makeup in

86
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,959
all day hola rina i'm filming a video

87
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,080
where i ask my favorite celebrities to

88
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,720
recommend a product for my makeup

89
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,840
routine

90
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:23,520
do you have a setting powder that

91
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,480
you love love you okay so for contour i

92
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,080
definitely want to reach out to people

93
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,959
that have like very structured beautiful

94
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,400
facial features

95
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,959
and the first person that comes to mind

96
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,080
has to be miss alexa to me from euphoria

97
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,360
she's one of my favorite people i think

98
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,640
i actually may have reached out to her

99
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,400
last year for the savings like video and

100
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,760
did not get a response but she did have

101
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,760
her collaboration with mac in the

102
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,640
meantime and euphoria season two is just

103
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,720
starting right now

104
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,840
so it doesn't hurt to at least try to

105
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,120
shoot my shot again

106
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,200
oh my god she hasn't posted on instagram

107
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,879
since march 5th she's not seeing this

108
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,560
okay well considering miss demi has not

109
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,840
posted on instagram in almost four

110
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,800
months now i definitely want to reach

111
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,480
out to a few other people

112
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,920
just in case she doesn't respond so i

113
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,959
also want to dm rita ora

114
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:02,800

115
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:05,280

she probably will see this okay so now

120
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,319
for blush i definitely want to try

121
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,879

so much fun to film and the look was

145
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,400
absolutely sickening also if you

146
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,280

147
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,720
extremely

148
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,319
particular and specific about how she

149
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,920
wanted her eyebrows she almost didn't

150
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,319

151
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,120
oh

152
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,680

153
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,200
she's a

154
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,959
she's an mua now we ended up slaying

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,319

so which product should i use to slay

162
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,280
mine next in our makeup routine is going

163
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,560
to be the highlighter and i have the

164
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,000
perfect person in mind that i want to

165
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,280
reach out to for today's video and that

166
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,359
has to be the queen herself

167
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,639
jlo i think that i dm'd her last year

168
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:23,840
for this video and she did not respond

169
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,560
but regardless i'm going to ask her

170
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,840
about my highlight

171
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,880
just in case jayla does not respond i

172
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,000
definitely want to reach out to somebody

173
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,560
else that is known for having a

174
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,479
beautiful

175
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,840
glowy skin i've talked about her many

176
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,880
different times in videos but i've never

177
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,320
actually met her before

178
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,000
but i think i want to message miss emily

179
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,120
ronachowski

180
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,160
so for the eyeshadow look today i

181
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,680
definitely want to reach out to somebody

183
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,600

neutral brown in the crease

185
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,160

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,960
like crazy and the first person that

187
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,199
comes to mind

finish off the entire eye look and pull

259
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,360
it all together so i definitely want to

260
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,680
reach out to somebody that is known for

261
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,520
having

262
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,960
really really good lashes and i think i

263
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,880
want to dm

264
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,960
kourtney kardashian i know you're all

265
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,199
about natural makeup so i was wondering

266
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,919
if you have a favorite mascara

267
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,360
that you recommend okay so our makeup

268
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,720
routine is almost done we only have one

269
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,560
step left and that is of course going to

270
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,479
be the lipidy doodahs i want to message

271
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,240
one more legendary person to end off

272
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,319
this video and that has got to be

273
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,520
miss naomi campbell first of all she

274
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,280
definitely knows her way around the

275
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,560
makeup chair and full glam considering

276
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,080
she is literally the most iconic

277
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,160
supermodel in the entire world

278
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,080
but i was also a guest on her show no

279
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,440
filter with naomi literally this morning

280
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,800
coincidentally that i'm filming this

281
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,720
video she was literally so nice and we

282
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,840
talked all about beautiful makeup looks

283
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,919
so i feel like she'll have a really good

284
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,360
recommendation for lips to finalize the

285
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,479
whole look

286
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,840
all right you guys we are back it has

287
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,280
been about a week since we filmed the

288
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,319
intro to this video i thought i would

289
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,759
give you a cute little

290
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,440
update because we've had this one for

291
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,960
several days now and he may look all

292
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,479
cute and innocent right now and a lot of

293
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,720
the times he is okay but i am

294
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,240
very convinced at this point that satan

295
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,919
himself is literally inside of this dog

296
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,199
because he's still nibbling on all of us

297
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:01,440
he's gone to the bathroom inside

298
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,960
several more times very much unlike finn

299
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,560
finnegan on the other hand is a little

300
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,240
angel just sleeping on the filming room

301
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,960
couch could not be any better behaved

302
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,240
and this dog

303
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,240
he's really giving me a run for my money

304
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,879
but theodore will become trained and he

305
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,319
will be

306
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,000
a good behaved member of the charles

307
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,599
family huh

308
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,280
all right you guys i am so excited ready

309
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,120
to jump right in for a final makeup look

310
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,800
today my skin is not having it so it is

311
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,080
time to move on to our first step which

312
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,000
is going to be a foundation

313
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,520
and we did get a response from the queen

314
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,360
i keep saying the queen the legend that

315
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,039
i found like shut up james

316
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,560

317
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,320
people and i got a response from gigi

318
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,320

we are so excited oh my god i am too

320
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,680
my favorite right now is the maybelline

321
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,880
dream radiant liquid a couple drop mixes

322
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,479
in really well with my moisturizer but i

323
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,800
can also use more and layer up if i want

324
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,399
more

325
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,000
full coverage and feel so smooth and

326
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,920
light on the skin i went and picked up

327
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,839
the maybelline dream radiant liquid and

328
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,720
i grabbed shade number 50 for myself

329
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,160
which is a creamy

330
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,000
natural so i'm just going to go ahead

331
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,440
and apply this just like normal

332
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,480
and see how it looks okay we're just

333
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,460

334
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,600
onto this

335
00:08:55,460 --> 00:09:00,000

00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,640
want to see that video down below wow

374
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,399
this color is really

375
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,480
really light for me but that's my own

376
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,760
fault not carol g's i'm definitely gonna

377
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,440
have to make this work

378
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,880
okay well the base is looking really

379
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,560
really cute so far and now it is time to

380
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,079
set it all in place with of course a

381
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,200
setting powder and for this i got a

382
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:16,000
response as well from

383
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,040
rosalia and she said hi i love this one

384
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,320
hope you're doing well

385
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,680
celia i love you the most girl i hope

386
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,560
you're doing well too and she

387
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,399
recommended the

388
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,760
mac blot and plus the mac blot and

389
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,640
pressed powder which i've actually never

390
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,760
tried out before

391
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,360
but definitely i'm pumped to try i

392
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,120
am not exactly sure how a blotting

393
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,320
powder is going to work to set the

394
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,959
entire face

395
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,079
but open to everything okay i'm not 100

396
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,920
sure how i'm thinking about this whole

397
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,760
powder situation that being said i have

398
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,959
a feeling that this would be a really

399
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,320
really good product to use once your

400
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,600
makeup is already completed

401
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,680
like if you get oily or anything to just

402
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,680
like get rid of the natural oils but it

403
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,800
did at least lock my makeup in place now

404
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,240
that the base is all done it is

405
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,839
definitely time to add back some color

406
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,440
and dimension to the face because we

407
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,040
definitely need it right now and miss

408
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,560
rita ora did come through with a

409
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,760
suggestion she said hi beauty first of

410
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,519
all i love your videos i watch them and

411
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,120
obsess with your face rita i am obsessed

412
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,160
with you and your face and your music

413
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,640
and she recommended

414
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,240
the tom ford shape and illuminate

415
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,680
bronzer aside from the eyeliner which i

416
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,200
do actually use all the time i don't

417
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,880
think i've ever actually tried any

418
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,560
tom ford like makeup products so i'm

419
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:18,399
definitely excited to dip in and

420
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,399
oh it's a cream bronzer

421
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,560
i don't know what this means you can't

422
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,760
really put creams over top of powders it

423
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,800
like doesn't really blend well and i

424
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,160
just set my face in place

425
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,680
okay let me just try this i'm gonna grab

426
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,399
my rare beauty foundation brush which

427
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,079
did come from

428
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,920
the selena package which is the next

429
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:36,400
step um i really like this brush spoiler

430
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:39,529
alert and dip into this

431
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,529
[Music]

432
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,600
product this is not weird as well this

433
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,000
is my fault

434
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,279
um wow okay i'm just gonna really pat

435
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
this product in and try to blend it down

436
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,000
as best as i can

437
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:56,240
what child chat i mean that looks okay

438
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,279
yeah yeah i should have opened this

439
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,800
before i got started because this would

440
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:01,839
have been probably beautiful like right

441
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,160
over top of the foundation

442
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,519
do you think yeah i did blend it out and

443
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,800
i think that it looks cute and it is now

444
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,120
time to go on to the next step which i

445
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,720
am

446
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,160
so excited for and that is of course

447
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,680
going to be blush as you guys saw in the

448
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,959
beginning i got an unexpected facetime

449
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,560
call from my good friend and now

450
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,160
neighbor miss selena gomez she

451
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,760
recommended that i try the rare beauty

452
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,639
liquid blush in the shade bliss which

453
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,480
i'm going to do

454
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,240
right now but i'm honestly so excited to

455
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,440
try out the rest of the products as well

456
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,279
and selena and i have been talking about

457
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,079
doing a collab in person once the world

458
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,680
is a little bit more

459
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,279
back to normal that would be literally

460
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,560
so much fun so definitely let us know if

461
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,920
you guys want to see that okay now

462
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,279
selena did tell me that these blushes

463
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,600
are super super pigmented so i'm just

464
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,880
going to do a tiny few dots on my face

465
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,959
and start blending it out

466
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,000
oh my god wow that actually oh that

467
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,279
color is so pretty

468
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,320
are you literally kidding me i was

469
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,839
definitely a little bit concerned with

470
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,760
putting a liquid blush over top of

471
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,120
my powder that layered on literally so

472
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,639
nicely and it's such a gorgeous

473
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,680
wash of color are you literally kidding

474
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,560
right now i'm actually gonna add a

475
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,079
little bit more

476
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,519
okay i may or may not have went a little

477
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,760
bit overboard with the blush but i've

478
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,360
been

479
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,440
loving vibrant colors recently i think

480
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,079
this looks super super cute selena you

481
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,360
and your team

482
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,959
killed it with this formula i am

483
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,399
obsessed with this blush and honestly

484
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,760
this color and i'm so excited to check

485
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,040
out all the other products as well

486
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,399
our next step is going to be eyebrows

487
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,120
and we did get a response from my good

488
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,360
sis miss

489
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,839
doji cat now at first she suggested that

490
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,839
i should use peanut butter

491
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,839
just so funny and then after prying she

492
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,040
suggested that i use anastasia beverly

493
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,800
hills which is definitely my favorite

494
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,480
go-to brow products as well so i'm just

495
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,760
gonna grab my little angled brush and my

496
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,639
anastasia brow powder in the shade

497
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,160
medium brown

498
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,519
and go to town just like normal all

499
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,279
right you guys the brows are now done

500
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,800
and slayed and it is time to move on to

501
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,519
my favorite part of my makeup routine

502
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,760
you guys know

503
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,680
is the eyeshadow portion and i messaged

504
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,160
cardi b hoping for a crazy look and she

505
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,920
definitely

506
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,360
came through cardi sent me back a few

507
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,320
different voice memos which i actually

508
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,320
cannot play

509
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,240
on video one because they contain

510
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,000
personal information but also two

511
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,440
they hinted at something that i really

512
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,880
was not planning on telling you guys

513
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,839
just yet because i wanted it to be a

514
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,120
surprise but in a universe where there

515
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,720
may or may not be

516
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,639
not confirming or denying anything a

517
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,680
james x party collaboration coming in a

518
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,279
few weeks from now

519
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,360
imagining like if i was planning out

520
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,240
that collab if it was to actually happen

521
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,000
don't really know

522
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,199
i may or may not have sent cardi a few

523
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,279
different look ideas one of them

524
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:07,040
including a whop makeup look and she may

525
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,240
or not have told me to do that makeup

526
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,240
look for this video

527
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,440
because we're gonna do something if we

528
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:17,120
were to do something

529
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:18,639
um even more iconic for that

530
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,839
long story short too long didn't read

531
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,440
cardi told me to do a makeup look

532
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:25,199
inspired by the [ __ ] music video and i

533
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:28,079
have the perfect look in mind to do

534
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,079
seven days a week

535
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,800
all right you guys so to start off this

536
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,639
waff inspired look i'm first going to

537
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,399
grab an emma 506 brush and dip right

538
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,839
into the dark brown shade in my palette

539
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,680
called tea and i'm going to start

540
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,279
packing the shade right into my crease

541
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,199
just kind of laying that color in there

542
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,399
and i'm going to draw on in the shape of

543
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,000
a typical

544
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,320
cut crease next i'm going to grab my

545
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,440
m456 brush and dip into a coated james

546
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,079
and i'm going to start buffing out that

547
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,519
dark brown

548
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,040
and then with my m514 brush i'm going to

549
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,839
dip into 508 and use this as my

550
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,800
transition shade

551
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,320
now with another blending brush i'm

552
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,760
going to dip into a little bit of rusted

553
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,440
and a little bit of your kidding as well

554
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,079
just add a little bit more orange depth

555
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,279
into this

556
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,600
crease and now finally i'm just going to

557
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:03,040
grab a tiny little fluffy brush the m562

558
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,240
and dip into a little bit of

559
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,519
benny and i'm going to use this to

560
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,120
deepen the crease even more with a

561
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,320
little bit of a face on a pencil brush

562
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,920
i'm just going to use this to highlight

563
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,440
my brow bone now that our crease is all

564
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,639
laid down and blended out of course it

565
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,839
is time to cut it so i'm just going to

566
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,040
grab a little bit of

567
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,680
concealer and a flat top brush and i'm

568
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,880
just going to

569
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,160
carve it out then grab a little bit of

570
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,440
canvas on a flat brush i'm just going to

571
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,720
set that concealer in place

572
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,320
okay so i want to go ahead and add a

573
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,600
really cool cheetah print effect to this

574
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,959
eyeshadow look personally i am not

575
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,519
really the biggest fan of animal print

576
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,680
however

577
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:32,079
i do think both cardi and kylie looked

578
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,600
so so sickening in the music video

579
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:35,440
and when i showed this look to cardi she

580
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,040
was obsessed with it so i'm gonna

581
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,240
put that on the eyes i'm just gonna grab

582
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,920
a tiny liner brush a little bit of

583
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,880
concealer and then just start making

584
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,519
random little

585
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,920
splotches in the eyeshadow just like

586
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,440
that

587
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,040
i'm just going to lightly dust over

588
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,639
those concealer splotches with the light

589
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,240
orange color on our fluffy brush from

590
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,199
before just to kind of set them in place

591
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,040
then you're going to go ahead and grab

592
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,480
any black liner i happen to pick up the

593
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,279
one from rare beauty just because i want

594
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,279
to try it out

595
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,720
for this look and we're going to start

596
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,320
adding the little like cheetah

597
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,600
spots basically in all those little

598
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,079
spots that you created you're just going

599
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,839
to

600
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,920
honestly messily start adding like

601
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,000
little like circles

602
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,120
around them there we go now using the

603
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,399
same colors from before i'm basically

604
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,560
going to start sketching out a

605
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,079
smoky liner just using a little bit of

606
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,680
10 off to start adding in

607
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:18,079
the top color and then using a little

608
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,720
bit of tea and no beans to add in a

609
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,160
little bit more

610
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,240
and then finally grabbing benny and just

611
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,199
patting this right onto the lash line to

612
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,880
create that liner

613
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,399
look now for the lower lash line just

614
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,000
repeating the same exact process in the

615
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,240
opposite step so grabbing a little bit

616
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,399
of

617
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,160
spooky and benny and then getting a

618
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,639
little bit of 10 off okay now i am

619
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,399
literally

620
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,680
praying that this does not mess it up

621
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,120
but i think i'm going to grab a little

622
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,800
bit of the electric cake liner from

623
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,440
anasazi beverly hills the norvina

624
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,519
collection

625
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,959
and grab the purple shade inspired by a

626
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,199
megan's look from the video

627
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,800
and add this into the crease and last

628
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,920
but finally not least i'm going to grab

629
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,680
just a little bit of

630
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,600
face and ring light mixed together and

631
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,240
pop that right on the inner corner for

632
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,000
some nice

633
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,000
glow all right you guys that is one eye

634
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,440
of this cardi b wolf inspired look all

635
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,279
complete i think this turned out

636
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,720
super super cute but it was very

637
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,000
challenging so i'm going to cut do the

638
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,680
other eye off camera which is going to

639
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,439
take me quite a while and i'll be right

640
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,559
back to finish off the rest of the look

641
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,799
all right you guys we are back with the

642
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,919
eyeshadow on both eyes all complete i am

643
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,240
literally loving this look

644
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,919
so so so much but it is not done just

645
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,679
quite yet we still have to of course add

646
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,120
on our lashes and we did reach out to a

647
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,880
few different people for mascara and we

648
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,559
got a response from the one and only

649
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,000
kourtney kardashian courtney said that

650
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,400
her top three favorite mascaras are the

651
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,720

beauty lash snack lengthening mascara

653
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,720

654
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:30,559
mascara and also the ilia limitless lash

655
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,160
mascara oh all those are quite the

656
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:34,080
mouthful but i do actually have

657
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,840
addison's new item beauty mascara right

00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,559

659
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,960

660
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:41,440

these of course we have highlighter next

669
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,360
although the lack of

670
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,720
powder is kind of giving me that look

671
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,000
already but i do want to add a little

672
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,160
bit of extra glow

673
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,760
unfortunately jlo did not respond but we

674
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,400
did get an answer from a supermodel

675
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,039
herself

676
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,480

on the last step which is going to be

695
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,640
the lips to finalize the entire look and

696
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,440
tie it all together we did get a

697
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,760

the number one the only and a new friend

699
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,799
of mine miss naomi campbell she said

700
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,360
favorite lip color at the moment is

701
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:47,039
boudoir rose 522 by pat mcgrath lab

702
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,440
gives us a hint of pink and a natural

703
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,799
glow

704
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,440
and i need to go ahead and pick up this

705
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:53,520
very lipstick right here

706
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,200
oh i'm not exactly sure how i feel about

707
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,200
this specific color with this look

708
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,520
but naomi is a queen so we're going to

709
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,039
trust her input and hope for the best

710
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,039
oh it's more like a lip tint okay this

711
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:05,039
is cute okay you guys this glam process

712
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,559
has lasted forever so last but not least

713
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,840
i'm gonna take my own recommendation and

714
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,760
use the morphe prep and set setting

715
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,720
spray use code james for 10 off to lock

716
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,559
this all in place

717
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,400
and finally that is this makeup look

718
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:17,520
chosen by my favorite celebrities

719
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,559

720
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,480

today oh my god i cannot wait

722
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,400
to take a photo doing these videos is

723
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,520
always so so much fun but also a major

724
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,200
risk as well because you really never

725
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,559
know what anybody is going to pick but

726
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,160
