184
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:17,169
are and trust that and he said no you're

185
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,580
doing great so after all this I didn't

186
00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:21,220
know much about you at this point I'm

187
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:22,980
just joking around and stuff but you

188
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:25,710
told me that you have

189
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:28,380
turned out straight guys it elaborate on

190
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:31,770
that because you are famous celebrity

191
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:33,240
and you do you do live in Hollywood yes

192
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:35,400
where there's a lot of guys that will be

193
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,560
clout chasers is the new term yeah they

194
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,570
were using so you think it was somebody

195
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:43,230
that was maybe looking for something to

196
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:44,520
return from you yeah okay cool yeah

197
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:46,830
let's talk about it in science in

198
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,360
regards like LGBTQ people there's what's

199
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:50,160
called the Kinsey scale so the get this

200
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,170
goes for like zero to sex zero being

201
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,570
like completely straight yeah and six

202
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:56,010
being like completely gay okay and I

203
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:57,870
truly believe that the amount of people

204
00:07:56,010 --> 00:08:01,320
that are a flat-out zero or a flat-out

205
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:04,230
six is like very very small I think that

206
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:06,300
most people are very close to the ends

207
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:08,130
but there's a huge percentage in the

208
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:11,190
middle too if I had to put myself on it

209
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:12,570
I would put myself at like a 5.5 so

210
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,710
you're not even full gay I mean know

211
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,670
there have been girls in the past that I

212
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:16,200
if I thought were really really

213
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:17,970
beautiful there's also been like trans

214
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,620
guys in the pasta too that I would like

215
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:21,750
really early into for a moment in time

216
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:23,280
especially living in LA where

217
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:25,380
everybody's like a lot more open-minded

218
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,870
I think that honestly like the majority

219
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:29,190
of guys are like wanting to experiment I

220
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:30,990
used to hear rumors like that all the

221
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:33,060
time I like big big celebrities that

222
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:35,099
growing up already is like what really

223
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:37,229
that's crazy because I grew up in Staten

224
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:39,180
Island where it was like and I'm and you

225
00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:41,220
know couple years older than you so my

226
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:43,470
group of friends growing up everybody

227
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:46,110
was going for that same like tough guy

228
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:47,580
yeah straight guy image and I didn't

229
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:50,370
have any gay friends so it wasn't until

230
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:52,170
I moved out that like I finally started

231
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:53,880
meeting gay guys and working with them

232
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:56,220
and like barber shops or salons I'm just

233
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,140
like really having a relationship or

234
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:00,360
like you get to talk to them about more

235
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:02,940
than just the same [ __ ] yeah so like

236
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:05,220
for me for example like I am a guy

237
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:06,780
identify as a guy but I still call

238
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,400
myself a woman all the time yeah as a

239
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:10,200
joke and stuff but like I do try

240
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,090
everyone said well I have full nails I

241
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,710
have a hair on occasionally yeah so it's

242
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:17,010
like for a lot of people like those

243
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:19,470
the--my as someone who's just pretty as

244
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:21,060
opposed to mimic a man which is fine

245
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:22,890
like that's how I like to see myself as

246
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:25,620
to is just someone who's like a pretty

247
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:27,840
human person yeah so like a lot of

248
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,580
people are willing to look past and

249
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,260
experiment and see like if they'd be

250
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,700
into it to choose a song that they

251
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:34,240
either always wondered or they're into

252
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,500
me as a person and I

253
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,089
that's super super cool and

254
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,550
unfortunately that a lot of times leads

255
00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:40,630
to a hookup or like making out or

256
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:42,339
hanging out and then the next day

257
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:44,110
they're like we're adding and never

258
00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:45,580
talking to me guys or there's

259
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:47,230
internalized homophobia that has been

260
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:48,459
built up so long that led to them

261
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:50,170
wanting to experiment in the first place

262
00:09:48,459 --> 00:09:51,790
but then once they do it they're like eh

263
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:53,320
Oh gross and then I'll start getting all

264
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:56,020
sorts of death threats and angry

265
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:59,380
messages from them the next day after

266
00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:00,520
you guys monster it'll be or it'll be

267
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:02,470
like a repetitive thing where it's like

268
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:04,089
hey let's keep doing this on the DL and

269
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:05,020
it's a very very strange we're all but

270
00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:06,790
it's like you know what you're kind of

271
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:09,010
getting into when you're behind the

272
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:11,170
scenes but I truly do feel like there's

273
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:12,310
like a spectrum and everybody falls on

274
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:14,020
it at some point and like especially

275
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:15,670
right now - like in the world I feel

276
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:18,790
like there's a major emphasis on like

277
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:20,230
labels and for me personally like I do

278
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:21,580
think labels are really really important

279
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:23,890
because it obviously spreads awareness

280
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:26,470
people can be educated and also like

281
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:28,300
young kids that don't feel welcome can

282
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:30,250
be a part of something and can label

283
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,750
themselves but at the same time - I also

284
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,980
think like putting a label on something

285
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:35,230
especially yes there is a sexuality

286
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:37,000
before you're fully understanding what

287
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:38,890
it is can be really really toxic come

288
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,130
fix your the memes that are gonna be

289
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:45,310
made from the soup into me like what am

290
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:48,490
I thinking in my head I'm taking it yeah

291
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:49,630
I get it and that's like that's you can

292
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:51,490
like you should be able to experiment

293
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:53,050
and like test out different things and

294
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:54,430
talk to different people as like long as

295
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:56,470
there's some sort of instruction that

296
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:59,649
whether it be to their personality to

297
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:00,850
their image even D is actually - and

298
00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:02,260
link doesn't necessarily feels like that

299
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:04,480
you have to put a label on how do you

300
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:06,279
deal with homophobic comments I don't

301
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,380
care you don't start this and you never

302
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:10,660
did know did you like girl out of that

303
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:12,220
oh is this the one where I brush on the

304
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:14,649
highway no this is where you contour my

305
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:16,930
face okay this is where the video I

306
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:21,459
didn't get to see the rest of it did you

307
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:23,320
get 42 minutes in there long video video

308
00:11:21,459 --> 00:11:25,480
so this goes around the bones yeah like

309
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,640
right like wrap it here make it look

310
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:30,570
nice and chest hold okay I want to I

311
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:33,030
want a little overboard on that side

312
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:34,650
pounce at him have it in yeah yeah I

313
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:35,820
have a question for you job speaking and

314
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:38,190
like relation to what you just asked me

315
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,330
yeah because like after our video that

316
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:41,400
we did together there are a lot of

317
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:42,960
people come to me like wow James and

318
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,730
Jeff's like interaction was so cool

319
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,660
Jeffersonian Earth himself public I knew

320
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:47,820
we were straight obviously believe

321
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:50,340
looking back yeah it was really cool to

322
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,480
watch and like it was funny too because

323
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,590
I think a lot of kites aren't

324
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,210
comfortable enough with themselves to be

325
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:56,070
able to make those type of jokes how was

326
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:58,770
that reaction for you the fan reaction

327
00:11:56,070 --> 00:12:00,210
was mostly positive sometimes in person

328
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:01,980
people will come to me that I don't know

329
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:03,330
and they joke around with my sense of

330
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,830
humor and they'll come up to me and be

331
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:06,030
like Oh where's your boyfriend at or

332
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:07,590
something like that I'm like what the

333
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:08,940
hell you're talking about it first but

334
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:10,500
then I get it they're your fans and

335
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:12,060
stuff like that they just know that I

336
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,920
grew up around a lot yeah they want to

337
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:15,930
make that first impression memorable

338
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,340
yeah yes I was interesting I'm getting

339
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:19,980
used to it but I'm always growing him

340
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:21,660
and trying to learn as a person but I

341
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:23,070
did see on Twitter some really positive

342
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:25,200
tweets and that was really cool to see

343
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:27,330
that people could kind of move past that

344
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,670
toxic masculinity if I could have my

345
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:31,530
audience and and kind of do do something

346
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:33,240
positive yeah then I think that'd be

347
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:35,700
pretty cool that we have that effect on

348
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,770

349
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:40,190

there's so many different colors this is

372
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:32,850
harder than I thought no it's not let's

373
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:35,920
do last year's Coachella look okay

374
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:38,819
what was her first impression of me very

375
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:41,999
funny and like good at delegating

376
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:44,379
responsibility to everybody and kind of

377
00:13:41,999 --> 00:13:46,600
organizing a shoe thank you buddy and

378
00:13:44,379 --> 00:13:48,189
organized for two great qualities do me

379
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,300
know what was your first appreciated my

380
00:13:48,189 --> 00:13:52,209
first impression was that you were

381
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:54,939
insanely hot people know me for making

382
00:13:52,209 --> 00:13:56,050
like jokes at hot guys and stuff but I

383
00:13:54,939 --> 00:13:58,749
was not ready for you to start making

384
00:13:56,050 --> 00:14:02,399
them back at me so I would like I was

385
00:13:58,749 --> 00:14:04,959
shocked that was nothing about the head

386
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,819
the next question is could you tell that

387
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:10,329
your significant other liked you I mean

388
00:14:06,819 --> 00:14:12,069
yeah what is your favorite thing your

389
00:14:10,329 --> 00:14:13,959
significant other has ever said to you I

390
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:15,790
mean probably just that like you thought

391
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:17,740
my videos are funny because like you

392
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:18,939
give me the compliments about like being

393
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:21,129
good-looking I don't know how to take

394
00:14:18,939 --> 00:14:26,350
those what was your favorite thing I've

395
00:14:21,129 --> 00:14:29,079
ever said to you I can't I can't I can't

396
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:31,779
do this man it was a joke and welcome to

397
00:14:29,079 --> 00:14:33,699
joke it was just a friendly text I send

398
00:14:31,779 --> 00:14:36,309
it to all my guy friends I don't think

399
00:14:33,699 --> 00:14:37,749
you dad you're right next question so

400
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:39,550
I'm gonna teach you guys a little trick

401
00:14:37,749 --> 00:14:41,410
you guys at home this I learned from

402
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:43,540
barbering but it could also work for a

403
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:44,980
situation like whenever you go into a

404
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:46,509
job on a new person you're a little

405
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:48,610
nervous no matter what I don't care what

406
00:14:46,509 --> 00:14:50,499
you say it's like you have that fear of

407
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:53,139
messing off yeah however that you know

408
00:14:50,499 --> 00:14:54,879
so what I would do on like a lineup cuz

409
00:14:53,139 --> 00:14:58,269
the line if you can't repair so I would

410
00:14:54,879 --> 00:15:01,300
keep like one finger on the skin and now

411
00:14:58,269 --> 00:15:03,939
if you move or I'm a little shaky my

412
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:06,129
hand moves with your face so you kind of

413
00:15:03,939 --> 00:15:07,929
have that like extra stability so I

414
00:15:06,129 --> 00:15:08,350
think that'll work for something like

415
00:15:07,929 --> 00:15:11,620
this

416
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:15,129
all right put a little extra finger is

417
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:18,999
that okay don't be shy get in on there

418
00:15:15,129 --> 00:15:21,519
and use that as as your as your base job

419
00:15:18,999 --> 00:15:23,019
that actually looks so good thank you

420
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,519
that's funny the that's like the thought

421
00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:26,290
swing letter anybody's ever dying now

422
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:29,019
this is really my favorite part about

423
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:32,010
makeup uh I never stood back I never pay

424
00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:34,140
attention at any other part oh he could

425
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:35,670
to the other side it's not done yet it's

426
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,660
almost how did you do what I literally

427
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:40,830
perfect and you can't get the amount

428
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:43,050
even you know I got overly confident

429
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:45,720
it's not the same at all yeah you're

430
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:48,680
right it is next you want to do the

431
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:50,700
highlighter sorry did I get it right use

432
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:53,430
highlighters to highlight your bone

433
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:55,620
structure yes so we're gonna highlight

434
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:58,530
the areas where the light would hit you

435
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:59,760
yes you want to do a little tap yeah

436
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:02,970
what do you think you're gonna put I

437
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:04,890
think here right if we got married who

438
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:06,840
would win an argument I always let the

439
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:09,180
other significant other wins oh my god

440
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:12,030

441
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:13,500

without it yeah just like this is true

447
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:29,070

face and you go to kiss it's just

449
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:34,010
