hottest things for you guys that being

15
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,240
said I just got a package from a wet and

16
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,700
wild in the mail a few days ago editors

17
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,770
their brand-new mega push in a

18
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,200
collection it came in this cute little

19
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:40,260
cushion looking the box and right up in

20
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,620
here and if you open it up the

21
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:45,270
collection comes with six cushion the

22
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,700
collection comes with six cushion

23
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:50,010
compacts and three cushion lip creams I

24
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,180
have no idea how a cushion lip cream is

25
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,239
gonna work but I guess we are going to

26
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,860
find out there's a highlight a contour

27
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,600
as well as four color correctors which I

28
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,609
was super excited to try out I have

29
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,350
never actually used a cushion of product

30
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:03,030
on my face before I know cushion

31
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,949
foundations were wildly wildly popular

32
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,590
for a very very long time a few like

33
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:08,790
month so in the beauty scene but I never

34
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,590
actually put one on my face so I'm

35
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,299
SuperDuper excited to try them out today

36
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,310
looking at this collection right now it

37
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:17,159
says they are fragrance free gluten free

38
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,750
cruelty free and vegan as well so that

39
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:20,640
means no animals were harmed in the

40
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,780
making of this product which is so

41
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,689
amazing because I know a lot of you guys

42
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,670
to care a lot about that yeah so the

43
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:28,350
cushion compacts retail for $5.99 each

44
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,270
and the lip cushions retailed for $4.99

45
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:32,310
each so definitely super cheap and

46
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,450
affordable but let's go ahead and put

47
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,850
these products at the real test and see

48
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,259
how they actually apply on a face before

49
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,820
we go in with any actual base Parts I

50
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:40,740
want to color cracked my face since that

51
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,689
is what majority of the set consists of

52
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,549
so I'm first gonna go to the shade peach

53
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:47,280
which is the orange color corrector and

54
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:48,570
that is for dark circles so each thing

55
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,890
comes with this little cushion on the

56
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:51,570
inside says wet and wild on it

57
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,060
definitely it's super duper cute and

58
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:55,950
then it is protected as well so it can't

59
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,810
get dirty thank God and then when you

60
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,560
open it up this is what it looks like Oh

61
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,240
God

62
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,280
okay looking at this on my hand it's

63
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,439
super super light which is definitely

64
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,119
very very worrying to me I did just get

65
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:07,500
a spray tan so I am darker than normal

66
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:09,810
and this is gonna be like a concealer

67
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,489
looking color and as well when you do

68
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,760
want to correct dark circles you

69
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:15,430
definitely want a pretty light

70
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:17,650
deep or even red shade depending on how

71
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:19,720
dark your skin tone is to really combat

72
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:21,519
deep blues and the purple tones of the

73
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,629
dark circles so I'm not really sure how

74
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:23,920
this is gonna work but I guess let's

75
00:02:22,629 --> 00:02:25,599
just go ahead and get some on the

76
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:32,260
cushion and apply it under the eyes and

77
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:33,700
see how it looks I mean the formula

78
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:36,160
feels right that this is definitely not

79
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:38,739
the right color that an orange color

80
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,200
corrector should be but then again Who

81
00:02:38,739 --> 00:02:42,280
am I to say what a color should be so I

82
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,319
guess we're just gonna continue putting

83
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,209
this on and see what it looks like later

84
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,079
on since its for darkest I'm also going

85
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:49,420
to take a little more of this and I'm

86
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:51,549
gonna put this on my facial hair area

87
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:53,769
just to combat once again that the blues

88
00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:55,780
and purple tones that hair gives off I

89
00:02:53,769 --> 00:02:57,849
literally just shaved my entire face

90
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:59,799
like two hours ago and it's already

91
00:02:57,849 --> 00:03:01,180
coming back n never heard a five o'clock

92
00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:04,209
shadow before apparently when you're me

93
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:06,160
you get 12 p.m. shadow the next one over

94
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:08,920
to use is the shade green which is for

95
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,930
redness and once again the green is

96
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,849
super super light it literally looks

97
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:14,560
white on camera the other green is

98
00:03:12,849 --> 00:03:16,000
swatch next to the orange on my hand

99
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,709
literally you can barely even tell that

100
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,819
there's color there normal color

101
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:21,519
correctors that I've seen before are

102
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:22,690
usually a lot deeper but once again not

103
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,010
gonna knock it until we put everything

104
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:25,840
else over our top and see how it really

105
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:27,669
looks like I said green color corrector

106
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,500
so typically for fixing redness and

107
00:03:27,669 --> 00:03:30,880
honestly I'm having a decent skin day

108
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:35,459
say so I'm just gonna place this over a

109
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:35,459
few little blemishes over here

110
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,640
I guess I'm just gonna top the access

111
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:51,000
pot onto my nose because my nose tends

112
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:52,470
to get pretty red the other two color

113
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,239
factors in the collection are yellow

114
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:56,069
which brightens and then purple which

115
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,269
combats yellow and neither one of those

116
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,470
are really problems that I have on my

117
00:03:57,269 --> 00:03:59,879
face so I guess I'm just gonna skip out

118
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:02,129
on those today and move right into

119
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:03,450
foundation now what I find it pretty

120
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:05,340
great about this entire collection is

121
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:07,049
that it is the magnet cushion collection

122
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,849
but the one product that isn't in this

123
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:10,230
collection is a cushion foundation the

124
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:11,879
kind of thing before cushion foundations

125
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:13,739
were hugely popular at one point and

126
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:15,090
even still are today I see a ton of

127
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:17,669
people using cushion foundations and

128
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:18,930
rocking them so so well so I was pretty

129
00:04:17,669 --> 00:04:20,940
surprised that there wasn't a cushion

130
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:22,410
foundation in this actual collection but

131
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,300
I went ahead and I picked up the white

132
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:26,340
and wild photo focus foundation to go

133
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,020
with this look I was debating whether or

134
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,280
not to use the Loreal cushion foundation

135
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,900
or the maple you'd won because I heard

136
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,910
those are superbomb and I did find them

137
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,350
at the drugstore but I figured using the

138
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:35,580
wet and wild one are probably a lot

139
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,840
better just because these are wet

140
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,580
allowed products so I'm sure the

141
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,260
formulas will kind of like work a little

142
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,850
bit better together than the Maybelline

143
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:43,289
formula or the L'Oreal formula mixed

144
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:44,669
together might make things look a little

145
00:04:43,289 --> 00:04:46,110
bit wonky I just want to get these

146
00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:48,120
products a very very fair chance because

147
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:49,680
a cushion product definitely is like a

148
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,870
weird concept to a lot of people so

149
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,400
gotta be fair you feel for my foundation

150
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:55,020
today I picked up the shade a cream

151
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,550
beige which is actually the only color

152
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,410
they had left at my seat yeah so I'm

153
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:00,060
pregnant the shade matches me we're

154
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:01,830
gonna go right ahead let me try this on

155
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,000
okay this is not the applicator I was

156
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:04,440
it's right there it's gonna layer this

157
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,639
right over top of all the color cocktail

158
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,039
okay and it's definitely a little bit

159
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:09,690
dark too we can definitely lighten this

160
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:11,810
up a little bit of concealer later on it

161
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:14,699
do not worry

162
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:16,410
the foundation is also only $5.99 and

163
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:17,880
wet and loud is definitely not playing

164
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,419
around when it comes to these amazing

165
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,639
prices

166
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:22,680
they say girlies on a budget we got you

167
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,690
an major respect for that makeup

168
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,659
companies so crazy expensive sometimes

169
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:29,729
so it's so relieving when we see amazing

170
00:05:27,659 --> 00:05:31,380
and cheap products but I don't want to

171
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:33,840
call it amazing yet I will let you guys

172
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:35,370
know in a few quick seconds alright so

173
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,780
that is the foundation all applied over

174
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:38,250
top of the color corrector honestly

175
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:40,289
looking at this in the mirror my face

176
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,580
looks so good right now and I know this

177
00:05:40,289 --> 00:05:45,690
foundation is not the point of the video

178
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:47,370
but for $5.99 I'm a little bit shook to

179
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:49,400
be honest then I definitely will be

180
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:51,380
trying this again for sure and

181
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,540
everyday makeup routine because I really

182
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:54,740
like the base a lot moving on to the

183
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,960
color correctors they were definitely a

184
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:59,870
lot lighter than normal color correctors

185
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,759
but my darkness and my redness is pretty

186
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:03,560
even out for the multiple you can't

187
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,270
really see anything especially under the

188
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,620
eyes equally the eyes look really really

189
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,880
bright and nice which definitely does

190
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:09,889
not work with a lot of foundations

191
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,410
sometimes I'm not sure how like full

192
00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:13,580
coverage this actual foundation is oh my

193
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:15,860
god the thing on the back first says

194
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:18,050
goodbye photo flash back maybe that's

195
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:19,370
why I love this foundation so much it

196
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:20,539
doesn't say the level of coverage on the

197
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,800
actual foundation bottle but I'm

198
00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:23,600
assuming this is pretty pretty full

199
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,889
coverage my skin looks very very even

200
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,020
and I definitely like the way the color

201
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:29,240
corrector applied so once again for only

202
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:31,639
five dollars definitely it not bad I'm

203
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,050
liking this a lot so far what we got to

204
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:34,940
concealer once again similar to the

205
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:36,860
foundation there was no pressed cushion

206
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:39,860
concealer so I went and I picked up the

207
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:41,570
photo focus concealer I picked up the

208
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:43,550
shade of light every because once again

209
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:46,400
this was the only shade they had and

210
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:47,960
stock at my seed yes see yes you need to

211
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,699
step your up I'm just gonna apply

212
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:56,960
this like a normal concealer in the high

213
00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:57,889
points of my face and blend it out the

214
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,110
one thing I have noticed about these

215
00:06:57,889 --> 00:07:01,280
products is that they all dry down

216
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:03,110
SuperDuper fast including the color

217
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,460
correctors I know the foundation and

218
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:06,320
concealer are not like the point of this

219
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:08,120
video but like I said I wanted to use

220
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:10,130
them just to kind of formula match

221
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,659
they're definitely super super drying

222
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:13,159
but that means I might not have to set

223
00:07:11,659 --> 00:07:15,740
my face today so I'm at the excited to

224
00:07:13,159 --> 00:07:17,030
see how this turns out now that the base

225
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,620
of how they are all on we're gonna do

226
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:20,840
some cream contouring and for this we're

227
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:23,300
gonna use the cushion contour in the

228
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,650
shade cafe ah slay that name is

229
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,659
literally so cute I cannot get over it

230
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:27,889
but similar to the color correctors

231
00:07:26,659 --> 00:07:29,090
we're gonna open up we're gonna have a

232
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:32,360
little bit of a cushion

233
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:33,740
hey cover and then the contour shade and

234
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,169
this one actually looks like it's a dark

235
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,039
color I thank God here's another thing

236
00:07:36,169 --> 00:07:39,020
on the back of my hand

237
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,789
definitely a pretty it warm tone so this

238
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:42,229
contour is gonna be very very bronze II

239
00:07:40,789 --> 00:07:44,000
who probably will not be using any

240
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:45,169
browser today but let's go ahead and put

241
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,510
out the actual face and see how it

242
00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:49,760
applies all right so this shade is

243
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:50,960
definitely a very very very light and

244
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,780
like I was saying before I do have a

245
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,820
spray tan right now so it is barely even

246
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:57,469
showing up my face which is a little bit

247
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,729
disappointing to me just because the

248
00:07:57,469 --> 00:08:00,260
other two shades are definitely very

249
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:01,440
very light as well so it seems like

250
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:03,720
anybody that's like dar

251
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,280
her than the shade mayonnaise will

252
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,260
probably not really be able to use this

253
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,580
set come on beauty brands we really need

254
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,780
to stop playing 50 shades of white here

255
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,430
there are darker people in the world

256
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,690
that want to wear your makeup all right

257
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,770
I'm just gonna dip right into my Beauty

258
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:15,330
Blender with this because of blending

259
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:17,130
this out with my little sponge is

260
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:18,900
definitely taking way too long

261
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:20,520
and I do not have a lot of time today so

262
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:29,910
I'm just going to blend this right and

263
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:31,500
using my Beauty Blender I'm gonna try to

264
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:33,390
cream contour my nose a little bit too

265
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,890
alright and that is the contouring and

266
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:36,240
chiseling all complete I don't hate it

267
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:38,099
it definitely looks pretty good but it's

268
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,200
definitely just very very very subtle

269
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:41,550
barely there type of situation this is

270
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,070
definitely a shade that it's going to

271
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:46,890
work for very very few people because it

272
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:48,300
is so light and bright pigmented which

273
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:50,280
is pretty disappointing like I said

274
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,960
before there are so many other shades of

275
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,220
color other than the 50 shades of white

276
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,990
it's particularly one it's going to be a

277
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,970
pass rate but I like the color corrector

278
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:59,040
so far and let's go ahead and move on

279
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,970
with the highlighter the last question

280
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,410
that I'm gonna be using is the

281
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:04,200
highlighter and this is in the shade

282
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:05,550
who's that pearl you guys know that

283
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,440
normally I would do my highlighter way

284
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:08,610
later on my makeup routine but I'm just

285
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,110
gonna do the base work today I'm gonna

286
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:12,600
do my eyes and make my eyebrows myself

287
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:14,940
off camera because this is a review not

288
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,200
a makeup tutorial I'm trying to get

289
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,150
better at like separating everything and

290
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,310
really learn how this type of content

291
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:22,500
works please bear with me but since this

292
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,490
is all eye cream and liquid base I want

293
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,080
to make sure that everything is like in

294
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:26,250
the right order and if I do decide to

295
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,380
use any powders I don't want to like

296
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:30,330
disrupt the product so this is what the

297
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:32,370
highlighter it looks like in the pan it

298
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:35,130
is a very brainy pinky tone time later

299
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:42,270
for sure so let's go ahead and grab our

300
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:44,880
little cushion now that is definitely

301
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:47,040
pretty pretty on the camera you can see

302
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,470
it next to do you color correctors it is

303
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,089
very very light it's almost like white

304
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:53,160
with just the tiniest little bit of pink

305
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:54,330
reflecting it so I'm very very worried

306
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,680
to see how this is gonna look on the

307
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:57,000
face hopefully doesn't give like that

308
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,810
great cast that a lot of highlighters

309
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,450
give but let's go ahead and

310
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:02,830
on NC okay so I don't know who thought

311
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:04,980
of applying highlighter with a cushion

312
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:06,790
but this is definitely not the shape of

313
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:09,040
thing that you'd want to be applying

314
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:10,180
glow with I'm gonna go to my yet Beauty

315
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,120
Blender and tied up buns out a little

316
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:14,680
bit

317
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:17,580
honestly it does look pretty chalky and

318
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:19,330
blending in a highlighter with a cushion

319
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,800
definitely will not do that again

320
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:22,660
alright let me stop while I'm ahead

321
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,010
before I get too crazy and then end up

322
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:26,650
taking my entire makeup off from hating

323
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:28,240
it so much this does not look awful I

324
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:29,620
really really like the color corrector

325
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,870
it worked very very well for me even

326
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:33,010
though it was SuperDuper light I really

327
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:35,110
like the foundation and I like the

328
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:36,010
concealer as well I guess it doesn't

329
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,270
really matter though because the

330
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:41,050
foundation and concealer were not really

331
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:41,440
part of this review but that's what it's

332
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:43,120
come to

333
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,440
now that the base is all complete I'm

334
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,240
gonna go into the other stuff off-camera

335
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,980
so I'm gonna do my brows and my eyes and

336
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,450
then I'll come back for the lips and

337
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,370
we're going to test out the lip cushions

338
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:53,500
that are in this collection so I will be

339
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:54,880
right back alright so I just threw

340
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,560
together this pink glowy look I

341
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,089
absolutely love how this turns out this

342
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,640
looks really really pretty on camera as

343
00:10:58,089 --> 00:11:02,890
well for everything I use the I love

344
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,900
SATA II X color pop collection and brand

345
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:07,480
new when I use this shade over here

346
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:09,400
which is called heavy glam it is so

347
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,720
beautiful and very very primitive as you

348
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,300
can see I use it for the inner corners

349
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,400
and my glow as well because Laura knows

350
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:17,710
that cushion highlighter was definitely

351
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:20,140
lacking but the last thing we have on

352
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:23,830
our list today is the lips so we have

353
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:25,720
these three lip cushion shades right up

354
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:26,920
in here you have this perfectly shape

355
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,140
which is called a bubble gum and

356
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:31,450
paradise this bright pink which is

357
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:34,510
called a doll so hard and then this

358
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:36,520
ready orange which is called melon like

359
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:37,839
it is I'm definitely not filling the

360
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,860
bright pink or the bright purple so

361
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,290
today I'm gonna go with this ready

362
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:43,270
orange hope shade to hopefully a match

363
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:45,070
between my hoodie and the pink and the

364
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:46,660
inner corners I honestly have no idea to

365
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:47,980
be completely honest as soon as this

366
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:49,660
video is over I'm gonna replace it with

367
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:51,550
a glossy lip for the insert and photo

368
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:53,260
anyway but obviously I want to finish

369
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:55,270
the review for you guys let's go ahead

370
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:57,279
and apply this one the melon like it is

371
00:11:55,270 --> 00:12:04,200
oh so yes this is what it means by a

372
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:04,200
cushion laughs okay interesting

373
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:10,350
this is strange

374
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:13,110
these are supposed to dry down Matt

375
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:15,030
watch it is definitely doing the firmly

376
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:16,470
honest thing is not awful if I'm looking

377
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:18,330
in the mirror it definitely is a little

378
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:19,440
bit patchy and Crocky I think that's

379
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:21,750
just because the applicator is

380
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,160
absolutely awful it's really hard to

381
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:25,050
give it like a precise line as you can

382
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:27,090
see like over here I'm Way outside of

383
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:29,060
the lip line I've hired up over a lion

384
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:32,580
as well and it is definitely not looking

385
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:35,460
even I don't know why a ball applicator

386
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:37,140
would ever be useful to anybody trying

387
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:38,250
to get a precise lip line maybe it was

388
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:41,010
just like four really really really

389
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:42,720
quick like just a like padding type

390
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:45,290
action but definitely not for like the

391
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,370
serious makeup liquid lipstick wearer

392
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:49,260
all right guys so does it look all

393
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:50,970
complete let's go back and recap

394
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,650
everything that we've tried out so far

395
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:54,930
so as a reminder we were reviewing the

396
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:58,740
Wet n Wild mega cushion collection today

397
00:12:54,930 --> 00:13:00,690
we had four four color correctors a

398
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:03,990
highlight cushion and a contour cushion

399
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:05,670
and then three lip cushions in this full

400
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:07,410
set color correctors they weren't

401
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:09,870
definitely pretty good they retail for a

402
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:11,340
$5.99 each I really liked the green one

403
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:13,110
and the orange one they did a very good

404
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:15,300
job of covering up my acne and my dark

405
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:16,890
circles my skin to look super even right

406
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:18,090
now and I am absolutely loving it

407
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:19,860
especially with the foundation as well

408
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:21,210
which was not cushion but definitely

409
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:23,790
will be used by me again

410
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:25,200
that's aside from the point though the

411
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:26,820
purple and yellow color correctors I

412
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,050
definitely would skip how odd I'm not

413
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:30,180
saying they're bad by any means I

414
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:31,950
honestly did not even try them but I am

415
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:33,690
someone who has never ever used a purple

416
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:34,770
or yellow color corrector I personally

417
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:36,300
don't really see much of a point for

418
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:37,440
them as for the highlighting contour

419
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,310
shades these are definitely a bit more

420
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,020
of a Miss for me

421
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:42,270
the cons well honestly looked really

422
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:44,040
really pretty on my skin tone it blends

423
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:46,530
out pretty well once I use my Beauty

424
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,940
Blender but it was not that intense the

425
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:49,650
worst parts about is that was very very

426
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:51,270
light I have a spray tan right now and

427
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:52,680
it barely showed up on me meaning for

428
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:54,600
anybody that's darker than me which is

429
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,940
like majority of the entire world

430
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,020
population it would not look very good

431
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,040
it would probably would honestly look

432
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,870
like a highlighter shade and death was

433
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,030
obviously not the goal of a contour

434
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:05,520
cushion but that being said it worked

435
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:07,410
for me what I recommend it may be it

436
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:09,120
definitely depends on your skin tone as

437
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:10,590
for the highlighter this almost

438
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,420
definitely the worst fail of the

439
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:13,260
collection it just like a lighter

440
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,820
pigment

441
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,740
I really didn't have much of like a high

442
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:19,320
lady glow once I finished off the look I

443
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:20,280
obviously packed on a ton of that pink

444
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,720
Cinco shadow that I use in the

445
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,310
intercourse as well for the highlighter

446
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,140
because the highlighter was looking very

447
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:27,120
very chalky and definitely not doing it

448
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:28,470
for me as was the three lip colors

449
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,210
economists you really really like the

450
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:32,310
formula they went on very very nicely

451
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:33,990
they applied nicely they look nice they

452
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:36,090
feel nice the only part I wouldn't

453
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:38,160
recommend is the actual applicator of

454
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:39,450
the lip cushions themselves the ball

455
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,280
applicator just really doesn't make a

456
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:42,480
whole lot of sense it's messy it's hard

457
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,730
to get a good lip line I definitely

458
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,530
would not recommend but for $4.99

459
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:48,000
honestly just get it squeeze it on your

460
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:50,640
hand and then use a lip brush because I

461
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,260
really like these lip products after

462
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,670
looking at everything I honestly cannot

463
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:55,590
decide if this collection is a hit or

464
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:57,450
miss it's not very often that a group of

465
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:58,260
products is so evenly split like I feel

466
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:59,640
like there are a lot of really really

467
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,840
good products and there are also a lot

468
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:03,600
of things that I would literally never

469
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:04,980
use again so I'm like hardcore on the

470
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,090
fence right now definitely leave me a

471
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,650

472
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:09,090
thought of each product have you used

477
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,040
definitely open to the concept like

478
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,360
cushion foundation I would love to try

479
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,680
