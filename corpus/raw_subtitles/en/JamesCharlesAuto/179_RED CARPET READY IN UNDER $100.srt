00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,360
hi sisters James Charles here and

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:05,490
welcome back to my youtube channel for

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,770
today so do I have something super fun

4
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,660
plan that I'm actually so excited for

5
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,519
but I'm still used to watch TV with my

6
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,549
mom all the time and the one thing that

7
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:17,039
I loved watching every single year was

8
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:18,779
award season I don't know why but

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,939
something about a red carpet just always

10
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:22,500
intrigued me so much and one of my

11
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:24,779
biggest goals growing up was to walk a

12
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,670
red carpet and now because of my amazing

13
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:28,349
job I pinch myself every single day

14
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,570
because at this point I feel like every

15
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:32,099
other week I'm walking some red carpet

16
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,660
and doing interviews which is so crazy

17
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:35,219
to me most celebrities when getting

18
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,899
photographed walking red carpet and

19
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:40,290
doing interviews like to look absolutely

20
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:41,579
perfect I mean of course who doesn't but

21
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,860
that usually includes a very expensive

22
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,780
gowns very very beautifully done hair

23
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,000
and intense glam makeup for some of the

24
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,550
best artists in the entire world but

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,309
that process can be extremely costly

26
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:55,980
today I want to try to get red carpet

27
00:00:53,309 --> 00:01:00,449
ready full makeup full outfit full

28
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:02,129
accessories in under $100 I have my $100

29
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:03,719
bill right in front of me left it over

30
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:13,619
to the stores and see if we can get red

31
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:15,330
carpet ready and under $100 all right

32
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:17,549
guys we're here at CVS is gonna be our

33
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:18,930
first stop of today's video hashtag not

34
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:20,970
sponsored you guys know I don't really

35
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:22,290
use drugstore products that often I mean

36
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,000
my regular foundation alone would

37
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,439
literally eat up half of our budget so

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,299
we're gonna do our best to find as many

39
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,100
products as we possibly can here to

40
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:30,750
still look good on a budget

41
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,159
the first was gonna be a foundation I

42
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:36,689
heard the new maybelline superstay

43
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:38,729
foundation is so bomb this one is $12 so

44
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:39,840
definitely a little bit pricy and

45
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:41,130
sealing I'm gonna grab the Maybelline

46
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,840
fit me concealer in the lightest shade

47
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:47,280
this one is 749 all right I know that

48
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,229
Nicki also owns the Maybelline fit me

49
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,880
loose it setting powder I'm gonna try to

50
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:52,320
save myself $2 and look for the Cote air

51
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,770
some powder at a different store and all

52
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,100
that one

53
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:59,219
six dollars however that is the powder

54
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,689
the created logic Mary oh and I've got

55
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:03,090
carpets you have to be photographed so

56
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:04,350
hopefully we're looking smooth sober

57
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,000
mascara is gonna pick up the covergirl

58
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:07,770
so ah she won't care which I was

59
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,619
literally the face for hello that is me

60
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,690
but it's $11.99 and that is way out of

61
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:13,769
budget at this point like give me a

62
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:16,349
discount or something I was in the

63
00:02:13,769 --> 00:02:19,440
commercial to the prognoses $10.50 the

64
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:22,140
pomade is $7.50 and so is the brown

65
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,420
shell I do have a pretty bushy brows but

66
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:26,040
Wow a sister a family cannot have brows

67
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,720
on fleek on a budget we're going with

68
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,480
this and said this is the NYX eyebrow

69
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:33,709
pencil this one is $5 didn't even see

70
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,790
her highlighting in contour palette is

71
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:40,200
$24.99 that's literally a quarter of our

72
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:42,000
budget I don't get it together sister

73
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,069
let's go for mascara today I'm gonna

74
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,989
grab the Maybelline a great lash mascara

75
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:47,549
that's one $5.99 and I know the

76
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:50,310
Maybelline is known for having really

77
00:02:47,549 --> 00:02:52,110
great mascaras so we're gonna pop that

78
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:53,549
one in hopefully it'll be a budget saver

79
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:55,680
because mascara can be crazy expensive

80
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:58,049
it's six to horse for a single shadow

81
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,299
from L'Oreal I don't think so sweetie

82
00:02:58,049 --> 00:03:03,269
what in wild has liquid liners for only

83
00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:05,400
three dollars so I'm gonna throw one of

84
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:08,160
those in there and then I also still

85
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,209
really badly need a highlighter okay so

86
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,829
what we're gonna do instead is I read

87
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:13,859
about the blush and highlighter do which

88
00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:16,260
is $5.99 and also the contour and banana

89
00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:17,819
powder drew which is also $5.99 so the

90
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,590
tools together equal the same price but

91
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:20,790
I'm gonna put this one back sorry sister

92
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:22,470
elf I still love you

93
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:24,300
that way we're killing four birds with

94
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:27,360
two stones

95
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:28,950
yeah okay so you just hotel at CVS and

96
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,540
we have a bunch of products our total

97
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:33,270

98
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:35,280
have 55 dollars and one cent left for

99
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:37,380
the rest of this video not too bad but

100
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,360
we did already spend almost half our

101
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:40,770
budget and that's just on makeup we

102
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,360

103
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:45,660

look today all these loose motions from

109
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:01,770
kesab are $6.99 which is honestly not

110
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,930
much better than the old ones and before

111
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:07,230
but it is saving at two dollars and he's

112
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:09,060

129
00:04:50,270 --> 00:05:01,370

I'm gonna use a dollar 69 on my budget

139
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:20,660
on a snack okay guys so since we're here

140
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,790
earlier and already bought a bunch of

141
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:25,310
stuff we have a nine dollar off CVS

142
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:27,080
coupon design but oil CBS member so that

143
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:28,880
means it's ten dollars and ninety three

144
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,700
cents of lipstick and lip liner that we

145
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,430
just bought is now going to come to one

146
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:36,560
dollar in seventh wheel of a bargaining

147
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:38,300
couponing sister extreme couponers is

148
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,520
quaking right now alright guys we just

149
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:42,170
got back we finished our entire face of

150
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,910
makeup except for one thing and that is

151
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:45,290
the trends there's a powder I know the

152
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:47,480
Cody Arizona is one of the cheapest and

153
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:48,860
best powders on the market but it's

154
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,650
always a little bit a Walmart which we

155
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:53,720
don't really have a lot of so what I'm

156
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:55,550
gonna do is that is five dollars and

157
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,980
ninety seven cents and sales tax is

158
00:05:55,550 --> 00:06:02,060
eight percent so if we do five wait nine

159
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:04,790
eight times 1.08 we get six dollars and

160
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:07,790
forty-five cents and subtract that from

161
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:17,000
the budget

162
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:19,310
3 34 35 36 36 dollars and 56 cents and

163
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,900
when you just get an entire outfit so

164
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:22,160
the one option that I have left that

165
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:25,040
they can actually be a really great

166
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,510
solution is Santee alley if you don't

167
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,340
know what Santee alley it is basically a

168
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:30,020
really long street here in downtown LA

00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:32,390

00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:03,380
fabulous kind of tonight it's our red

183
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,420
carpet event and I am so beyond excited

184
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:06,980
we have thirty six dollars and fifty six

185
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:10,760
cents left and today we have to get a

186
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:13,760
full-on look I'm talking shoes shirt

187
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:15,350
pants accessories the full shebang in

188
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,540
order to get ready for this event and we

189
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:19,280
only have a few hours to do so hopefully

190
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:21,490
we'll be able to complete this look on a

191
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,490
budget

192
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:35,559
[Music]

193
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:41,520
we've shared a bunch of store stuff on

194
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:43,199
but we're coming to the same issue in

195
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,210
that everything is actually really cute

196
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,680
here but a lot of the stuff is like

197
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:48,030
literally taking of the entire budget if

198
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,039
we found a pair of shoes that were super

199
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:51,539
cute but there are 25 dollars we've got

200
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:53,370
a paragraph they're really cute but

201
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:55,050
there were 31 dollars we can't get those

202
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:57,949
the album only five dollars this is

203
00:07:55,050 --> 00:08:03,900
coming to be quite the dilemma up again

204
00:07:57,949 --> 00:08:05,520
I'm super Lindsay of Gucci so good but

205
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,229
I'm not thinking that a jumpsuit might

206
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,319
be a really good option because it's

207
00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:12,630
like two-in-one for one price so the

208
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,169
search has moved to a jumpsuit that'll

209
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:15,169
be our game plan

210
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:28,330
[Music]

211
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:31,150
okay so we ended up getting that

212
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:32,830
jumpsuit it was retailing for $34.99 but

213
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:37,390
we ended up being able to talk them down

214
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:39,310
to actually $20 even thank God but that

215
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:40,780
is still a huge chunk of our ad budget

216
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:43,870
that means we have sixteen dollars and

217
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:45,550
fifty six cents exactly left to finish

218
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:47,350
off this entire outfit we don't have

219
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:48,490
shoes we don't have accessories and

220
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:49,990
there's a slave home too

221
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:51,580
there's a million shoe shops here in

222
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:53,800
Santee alley but almost every single one

223
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:55,570
of them is just heel like I've seen an

224
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,250
87 billion pairs let's play but I've

225
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:59,170
seen like three pairs of boys shoes

226
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:00,340
which is like fine I guess I mean high

227
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:02,470
definitely a lot of a good a pair of

228
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:05,020
heels oh my god guys look we just found

229
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:06,280
these knockoff uses for homie $15 Lilly

230
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:08,980
they're not even close to real as you

231
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:10,750
can see I have mine on right up in here

232
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:12,190
but they are black and red which they

233
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:14,770
match perfectly in my jumpsuit and I

234
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:16,810
would so much other have a sneaker then

235
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:17,890
a heel on because lord knows I can't

236
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:19,570
walk in here to save my life and I'd

237
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,430
probably fall over so these might be the

238
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:23,230
guy okay guys so my shoes earned nine

239
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:24,610
and a half ten but we only have a size

240
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:28,480
eight so I'm gonna see if my sister

241
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:31,810
could do a squeeze we I actually fit

242
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,370
them they fit I need these right now

243
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:34,420
okay guys we have our jumpsuit and our

244
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:36,190
shoes now and the only thing that's left

245
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:39,640
is accessories but our only problem is

246
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:41,740
we have a remaining balance of 56 cent

247
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,390
so we might have to go a few dollars

248
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:45,580
over budget to get this perfect red

249
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:47,050
carpet look but I'm willing to do so

250
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:49,000
it's a lot we're gonna break the bank by

251
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:50,290
just 56 cents it could really make or

252
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,730
break a look so let's see what we can

253
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:54,370
find

254
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:55,900
not only we have budgets ahem okay guys

255
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:58,840
we just found this bracelet and three

256
00:09:55,900 --> 00:10:01,210
ring trio for only 99 cents that does

257
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,650
actually put us over budget by a few

258
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:05,670
cents but I think accessories can really

259
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:05,670
make or break a look

260
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,129
we are an you sent over budget but we

261
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:12,959
did it we are super close to $100 and

262
00:10:11,129 --> 00:10:14,730
now that we're over budget oh well I

263
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,500
think I have one last thing that I want

264
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:17,970
to buy before we go to today's law all

265
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,740
right sisters this should be a super

266
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:21,629
easy and quick joke so makeup tutorial

267
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:24,629
today we certainly do not have many

268
00:10:21,629 --> 00:10:25,980
items to work with so starting off we do

269
00:10:24,629 --> 00:10:27,269
not pry in the skin that because that

270
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:29,430
was out of budget so I'm gonna go to the

271
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:31,319
Maybelline a brand new super state

272
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:33,750
foundation I got the shake lassic i

273
00:10:31,319 --> 00:10:36,600
erase all I am praying this matches oh

274
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:38,160
okay honestly not a bad match at all I'm

275
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,819
just going to blend this all over the

276
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:44,670
skin like normal oh this foundation

277
00:10:41,819 --> 00:10:48,389
looks amazing oh my god how much what

278
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:49,529
it's only $11 I'm Chuck the one really

279
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:51,240
annoying thing about drugs are makeup

280
00:10:49,529 --> 00:10:52,920
shopping no matter how good a product is

281
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,779
is that you can't actually test it out

282
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,699
in store so as you can see it this

283
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,930
foundation definitely oxidized a little

284
00:10:56,699 --> 00:11:00,000
bit and is a little bit darker than my

285
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:01,199
skin tone so I'm gonna go to my next

286
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,699
step being the Maybelline fit me

287
00:11:01,199 --> 00:11:04,290
concealer and I got the lightest shade

288
00:11:02,699 --> 00:11:05,819
so hopefully this will help kind of

289
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:07,529
brighten everything up and kind of make

290
00:11:05,819 --> 00:11:08,939
it match a little bit better I'm gonna

291
00:11:07,529 --> 00:11:11,879
put this right in the center of my

292
00:11:08,939 --> 00:11:14,040
forehead and then right under my eyes

293
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:15,480
and a triangle shape and you guys know

294
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,189
used to be my concealer all the way out

295
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,290
up into here for that really snatched

296
00:11:17,189 --> 00:11:21,389
look but more recently I've been kind of

297
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:24,449
focusing on my highlights only on the

298
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:26,040
very center of my face it's a very Kim

299
00:11:24,449 --> 00:11:27,600
case I love holiday and contouring but I

300
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,550
really really love how it makes my skin

301
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,199
look and how it brings attention right

302
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:34,079
here to the center of my face it's got a

303
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:36,720
cover of the mustache you guys not even

304
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:38,639
gonna lie I am absolutely in love with

305
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,589
how my skin looks right now I am so

306
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:42,149
shocked to the core it looks so

307
00:11:40,589 --> 00:11:43,529
beautiful oh my god

308
00:11:42,149 --> 00:11:45,660
I'm gonna go Mike oh dear some powder

309
00:11:43,529 --> 00:11:47,970
and just set underneath the eyes today

310
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:50,970
you guys know I usually love to kind of

311
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:52,529
make a face and plays but I also love to

312
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:53,309
go in with a setting sprays and like a

313
00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:55,470
mac fix+

314
00:11:53,309 --> 00:11:58,500
in between at my powder steps to really

315
00:11:55,470 --> 00:12:00,629
melt everything in and $20 for mac fix+

316
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:04,649
was definitely not in the budget I mean

317
00:12:00,629 --> 00:12:06,800
literally fix+ bodysuit fix+ bodysuit

318
00:12:04,649 --> 00:12:11,689
the last night I went to the gym was

319
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,689
never so I'd rather not go naked

320
00:12:13,939 --> 00:12:17,929
oh you're literally kidding me so I'm

321
00:12:16,489 --> 00:12:19,999
gonna temp to bronze and copper in phase

322
00:12:17,929 --> 00:12:24,799
using what's left of this way while do

323
00:12:19,999 --> 00:12:25,999
oh crap oh that is very pigmented maybe

324
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:27,979
because it's broken into a million

325
00:12:25,999 --> 00:12:30,409
pieces can't forget to chisel out the

326
00:12:27,979 --> 00:12:32,029
hairline of course let's be real though

327
00:12:30,409 --> 00:12:34,220
the true test of a contour sauce

328
00:12:32,029 --> 00:12:37,099
Broadway promoter is can it snatch a

329
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:40,099
sister knows I'm not not at the nose

330
00:12:37,099 --> 00:12:42,439
contour but I'm also not like happy with

331
00:12:40,099 --> 00:12:43,939
her she's like okay I'm gonna grab a

332
00:12:42,439 --> 00:12:46,069
flat powder brush and dip into the

333
00:12:43,939 --> 00:12:48,859
highlighting excuse me

334
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:50,479
banana powder side of this duo and I'm

335
00:12:48,859 --> 00:12:51,619
gonna pop this in the center of my

336
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:53,329
forehead to bring back some of the

337
00:12:51,619 --> 00:12:54,829
lights and I'm also gonna place this

338
00:12:53,329 --> 00:12:56,599
right underneath my eyes and right up to

339
00:12:54,829 --> 00:12:58,279
the sides of my nose to really brighten

340
00:12:56,599 --> 00:13:01,339
everything up and further the illusion

341
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:03,709
of a pinched and snatched rhinoplasty

342
00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:05,149
next to finish off my skin and base I'm

343
00:13:03,709 --> 00:13:07,189
gonna open up this blush and highlight

344
00:13:05,149 --> 00:13:09,859
our duo from Al I think this one was

345
00:13:07,189 --> 00:13:11,539
literally only a $5 which is a snow bomb

346
00:13:09,859 --> 00:13:13,339
and I'm just gonna play a both of these

347
00:13:11,539 --> 00:13:16,159
to my cheekbones starting off with a

348
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:17,689
highlighter hello

349
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:19,039
I'm gonna try digging my brush into this

350
00:13:17,689 --> 00:13:20,209
and actually breaking it a little bit to

351
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:23,419
see if that way the pigment will

352
00:13:20,209 --> 00:13:24,019
actually you know show up oh there she

353
00:13:23,419 --> 00:13:26,869
is

354
00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:27,979
okay I actually love how this looks I'm

355
00:13:26,869 --> 00:13:29,359
gonna go with a little bit of blush on

356
00:13:27,979 --> 00:13:34,729
an angled brush just to kind of blend

357
00:13:29,359 --> 00:13:37,089
the contour and highlight together or

358
00:13:34,729 --> 00:13:37,089
not

359
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:42,280
don't love doing this for some reason

360
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:43,450
you literally have to scrape the top

361
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,610
layer off of this I think it's because

362
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:47,200
it's a baked formula but the actual

363
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:49,990
pigmentation of the product underneath

364
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,820
is really really bomb and I'm loving how

365
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:53,140
my skin looks right now before I do my

366
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,250
brows my eyes as usual I'm just gonna

367
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:56,680
grab my damp Beauty Blender and

368
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:59,110
literally the lightest bit of powder and

369
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:01,510
just bake along the sides of my nose to

370
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:04,000
really snatch it in a place and then

371
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:07,300
just right underneath that contour as

372
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,710
well moving right along this is going to

373
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,390
be our brows and for this one we're

374
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:11,830
using the NYX eyebrow pencil that's

375
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:14,380
almost four dollars it was the only the

376
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:15,580
only one that was within budget let's

377
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,270
see how this one compares to our normal

378
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:19,270
I think

379
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:21,910
21 or 22 dollar benefit personally my

380
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:24,040
brow pencil oh this is big I mean let's

381
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:27,790
be real we do usually love a good sister

382
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:29,920
a big tip but right now this might not

383
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:31,600
be very helpful let's see what we can do

384
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,310
here this brow pencil supposed to be

385
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,720
dark brown but it started coming off as

386
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:39,250
like red on my skin this is not what we

387
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:42,280
need right now not the worst

388
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:43,240
I know but definitely not the best I'm

389
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,740
gonna grab my Maybelline fit me

390
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,510
concealer on the back of my hand and

391
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:47,950
just a flat top concealer brush and

392
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,120
attempt to clean them up a little bit

393
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:50,440
although I'm really not sure how much

394
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,270
that is gonna help being that the main

395
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:54,580
issue here is definitely the color of

396
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:56,500
the brow but I'm not gonna complain

397
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:59,320
because clearly we have not a single

398
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:01,840
penny left to go exchanges or trying to

399
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,460
get a new one so gotta make do with what

400
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,810
you got honestly it really doesn't look

401
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:06,850
top out I'm definitely being dramatic

402
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:08,410
and the rest my face looks amazing so

403
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:10,690
far so I don't want to get discouraged

404
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:12,520
by it just the brows no next of course

405
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:14,470
comes the eyes and if you're an avid and

406
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,670
creative makeup lover like I am you

407
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:17,650
would know that I shadow can sometimes

408
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:19,750
get really really expensive or really

409
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:21,790
fast for some reason though I was not

410
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:24,070
able to find a single big eye shadow

411
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:26,110
palette anywhere at any of the drugstore

412
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:27,580
as he went to I either found these ones

413
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:29,950
like white and wild is what I'm gonna be

414
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:31,740
using today or tiny little single

415
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:34,060
shadows from like L'Oreal that were like

416
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:37,180
$12 each hello

417
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:38,410
I absolutely did not think so so I

418
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,880
picked this but I'm gonna do my best to

419
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:41,260
create a soft claim look from it today

420
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,790
I'm first gonna go over tiny powder

421
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,560
blush in the shade this has a brow bone

422
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:45,930
and pop

423
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:47,910
right on the top my brow bone to give it

424
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:49,860
a nice little highlight and left before

425
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:51,480
I apply some shadow oh that's actually

426
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:52,410
kind of pretty I'll also go to place a

427
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,820
little bit of that right on the inner

428
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:56,070
corner to really make that area of my

429
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:57,420
face pop and bring attention to the eyes

430
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:59,550
I'm then gonna grab my fluffy brush this

431
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:01,050
is the morphe I'm a four-for-one use

432
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:03,240
cochise for 10% off for all your future

433
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:05,130
budget discount shopping and dip into

434
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,740
the shade up transition right up here at

435
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:09,690
the top tap off the excess and I'm gonna

436
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,530
pop that right in the crease as my

437
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:12,180
transition shade

438
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:14,100
well that pigmentation is definitely

439
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:16,380
rather unfortunate I guess and they say

440
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:18,780
transition they really mean transition

441
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:21,300
because that color is literally barely

442
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:23,370
even there I am like dying to put a

443
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:25,200
darker brown in the crease really define

444
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:28,440
it but the crease shade in this palette

445
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:30,180
is HTML shade which is a major major

446
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,770
makeup no no you do not put shimmers in

447
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:33,360
the crease literally ever there are

448
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:36,570
barely any rules to make up with that is

449
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:39,450
one of them for sure so I'm gonna do is

450
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:43,140
crack back open my very very shattered

451
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:46,830
wet-and-wild bronzer and dip into that

452
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:48,089
with a fluffy crease brush and use that

453
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:49,920
to define out the crease a little bit

454
00:16:48,089 --> 00:16:51,180
more okay now we're getting somewhere

455
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,070
popping back into the little eyeshadow

456
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,610
pot I'm gonna grab this pinkish shade

457
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:56,220
called

458
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:59,240
eyelid right on a dense packing brush

459
00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:02,910
and pack that right on but I would oh

460
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:05,130
that's actually kind of pretty with that

461
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:06,420
okay down I can work with that this

462
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:08,790
eyeshadow honestly is not looking back

463
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:10,199
at all I'm kind of taking it I'm gonna

464
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:12,120
finish off by adding a little bit of a

465
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:14,760
wing using the Wet n Wild mega liner

466
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:16,410
this was only three dollars you know

467
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:18,270
those days where our letter just keeps

468
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:20,310
getting thicker and thicker and thicker

469
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:21,780
because you keep messing up and putting

470
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:23,400
on concealer and then adding more liner

471
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:26,850
then messing up then putting on more

472
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:28,470
liner than adding more concealer today

473
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:29,850
is one of those days I really wanted to

474
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:31,500
find my lower lash in just a little bit

475
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:33,180
more but clearly we don't have any Tarte

476
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,980
brown eyeshadow so what I'm actually

477
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:37,610
gonna do is grab my brow pencil from

478
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:40,740
before and really lightly and carefully

479
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:42,770
run this right up against my lower lash

480
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:45,380
line to create a little bit

481
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:47,900
dimension oh oh that kind of actually

482
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:49,490
looks good hello hack this outlook isn't

483
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,900
even that bad but I think that lash is

484
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:53,210
directly gonna take it to the next level

485
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:56,210
so I'm gonna give my lashes a good and

486
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:57,710
fresh curl and then apply a layer of the

487
00:17:56,210 --> 00:18:00,260
Maybelline a great laughs that I found

488
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:01,970
at CVS this one was only seven dollars I

489
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:03,350
usually love Maybelline mascaras but

490
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:05,360
honestly not gonna lie I am definitely

491
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:06,559
not impressed with this one I feel like

492
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,910
with mascara it is definitely one of

493
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,950
those products that when you pay more

494
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:11,480
you usually do get more bang for your

495
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:12,950
buck but all-time favorites are the

496
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,780
benefit roller lash and Mac extended

497
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:17,059
play and this one will definitely not be

498
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:19,700
replacing either of those anytime soon

499
00:18:17,059 --> 00:18:21,110
so to add a little bit more oomph on my

500
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,059
eyes I'm gonna pop on these lashes from

501
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:24,559
kiss that I found at Walgreens these are

502
00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:28,040
in the style horse it and I got them

503
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:30,770
because they kind of loosely sorry Lily

504
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:32,210
arrived me of Miami looking at these

505
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:34,070
lashes if I could describe I would

506
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:36,170
simply say that they are underwhelming

507
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:39,559
the actual style of the lash is

508
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:40,910
literally so pretty and for only I think

509
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:42,860
they were six dollars and fifty cents

510
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:44,960
they're really really nice lashes

511
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:47,360
they're 3d they're separated they're

512
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,860
nice and fluffy the band is comfortable

513
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,750
but I would say that the hairs

514
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:52,460
themselves on the actual lashes are too

515
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:53,870
short and they don't make a big enough

516
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:55,070
impact so those are the eyes all

517
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:56,540
complete and that was definitely a

518
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:58,400
little bit of a struggle but I feel like

519
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:59,570
we came through I'm honestly a pretty

520
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,610
happy with these results

521
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:03,890
it looks pretty beautiful so I'm gonna

522
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:06,860
go ahead and wipe away the bake and it's

523
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:08,660
been on there for quite a long time now

524
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:10,340
I'm gonna go ahead and line my lips

525
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:12,740
quickly he's in the NYX liner and the

526
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:14,330
shade natural I really like this color

527
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:16,100
it was one religion by a few days ago

528
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:17,840
she uses one and she said this is her

529
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:19,130
all-time favorite so I had to pick it up

530
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,809
for today's look and it was only three

531
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:22,130
dollars and then last but certainly not

532
00:19:20,809 --> 00:19:23,750
least I'm gonna fill in my lips using

533
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:25,850
the NYX soft matte lip cream in the

534
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:27,950
shade of Stockholm all right sisters I

535
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:29,150
guess this look is complete normal you

536
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:31,010
know I would give myself a good spritz

537
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:33,110
of a setting spray but that was out of

538
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:34,910
budget for today so I'm gonna go ahead

539
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:36,620
and change into my red carpet-ready

540
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:39,900
outfit and I'll be right back to show

541
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:48,870
you guys the finished completed

542
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:51,960
oh you guys this is the finished

543
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:58,680
completed look particularly I have

544
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:59,790
something else hold on did I send an

545
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,050
extra twenty one dollars of the budget

546
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:02,360
that we didn't have to create a red

547
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:04,350
cover for myself

548
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:07,170
absolutely alright you guys so this is

549
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:08,610
the Braddock carpet both look complete

550
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:10,080
clearly I do not have a red carpet to

551
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:11,730
attend tonight but you know what it's

552
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,730
the thought that counts we have a full

553
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:17,220
look from head all the way down to the

554
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:18,960
toes and I'm honestly kind of living for

555
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:26,580
it not gonna lie it if we look in the

556
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:29,280
mirror overall this challenge was

557
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:32,130
honestly really really challenging but

558
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,840
also really really incredibly fun to do

559
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:35,070
although I definitely love to treat

560
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,230
myself going makeup shopping with

561
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:38,610
