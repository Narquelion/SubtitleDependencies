00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:36,119
liquid foundations or stick funders

43
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:37,530

00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:50,040
honey I don't try that one it's so good

49
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,290

50
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:56,850
foundation so I call it concealer

51
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:58,590

55
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:06,180

56
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,899

57
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,940

god that makes me love you so much more

62
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,780
people say that I sound like I have

63
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,980
something stuck in my throat when I'm

64
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,650
talking people say I sound like I'm

65
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:26,100
constantly sick which is I mean I guess

66
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:27,360
kind of true but minor minor truth to

67
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,400
people sound like it sounds like I'm

68
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,680
whining or that like I have like an old

69
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,940
lady's voice it's like a lot of people

70
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,300
hate my voice because I talk too fast

71
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:38,160
which we use a lot of people comment

72
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:40,440
saying that I give them anxiety because

73
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,540
I talk so fast which is really scary

74
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,730
because I really do try to not but I

75
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:46,410
can't help that so if you're one of

76
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:47,550
those people I apologize there's

77
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:49,680
actually a little speed button where if

78
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:52,110
you click the gear on your video you can

79
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,940
change the speed to 75 per size it was

80
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:55,680
200 and then I'll be a lot more slowed

81
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,610
down so if you were someone who wants to

82
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,020
hear me talk a little bit slower or

83
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,970
anybody for that matter chocolate mousse

84
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:01,320
a little or faster that's a really good

85
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:03,030
hack for you guys okay I'm gonna contro

86
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:07,230
Laura's face using my benefit hoola

87
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:10,050
bronzer before favourites anything I'm

89
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:13,980

00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,630
the bronze is all on one check that I

93
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:20,790
absolutely love doing when it comes to a

94
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:22,650
contract and bronzing is taking a like

95
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:23,700
smaller fluffy brush like this one but I

96
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:25,260
let's go into the more cool toned

97
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,840
bronzer so this one is the Marc Jacobs

98
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:29,610
bronzer and tantastic which is definite

99
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,980
little bit more cool tone then benefit

100
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:33,959

101
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,730
tapered brush and just go in it right on

102
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:38,880

108
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:48,209
and really like gives you the snatched

109
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:49,980

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,750

126
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:18,120
dipping a tiny bit into the Marc Jacobs

127
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:20,340
fantastic and we're gonna check out

128
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,650
Laura's nose I love when I go out we can

129
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:26,370
see a snatch news so I'm like oh yeah

130
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:28,650
yeah oh so she's doing natch that nose

131
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:30,690
then this one I have a powder puff and

132
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:31,410
uses to bake the sides of sister Laura's

133
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,550
nose

134
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:34,230
what do you feel like you'd be doing if

135
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:36,060
you weren't on social media you didn't

136
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:37,950
take the social media path I'd only have

137
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,870
no idea and I think about that honestly

138
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:41,640
like you would be in college somewhere I

139
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:43,620
think I would too which scares me

140
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,450
because I think College definitely was

141
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,919
not for me and I think I don't think

142
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:48,210
college is for everybody I think

143
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:50,040
education is really important but I

144
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:51,870
don't think the college particularly for

145
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,070
everybody I think I would be really

146
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,480
struggling to figure out what I wanted

147
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:56,610
to do with my life it's like that's a

148
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,200
lot of people and hear me out when I how

149
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:00,330
I how much I agree with you on that

150
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:02,550
because I almost didn't graduate high

151
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:04,020
school but because Society said you know

152
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:06,210
you gotta go to polish to make money or

153
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:08,190
be smarter to do anything gray so I was

154
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:11,040
able to get into a college and it took

155
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:13,260
me three years into college and I had

156
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:15,600
filled out I was 24 years old I had felt

157
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:17,490
out and I was left with a ass load of

158
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,620
debt for forcing something that society

159
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:21,419
put on me make me feel like I was smart

160
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,220
so as a medical assistant at the time as

161
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:24,840
well working at dermatologists which I

162
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,669
made decent money I just really didn't

163
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,310
like the job so I got pushed into

164
00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:31,080
YouTube and I felt so madly in love with

165
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:33,060
it and then me and YouTube kind of grew

166
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,710
together and I created this amazing

167
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,990
career and it's all because I fell out

168
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:37,740
of college you know yeah I don't think

169
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,750
it's everybody I think that everybody

170
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,220
has a different path and education

171
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,840
definitely is not part of everybody I

172
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,070
don't know where I would be if it wasn't

173
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,870
for you too you know I started this

174
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:47,280
channel just simply as a makeup lover

175
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:49,560
and all of a sudden supposed to be a

176
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,440
professional businesswoman and you know

177
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,700
the role model for millions people and a

178
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,710
professional makeup artists and do

179
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,390
everything perfect and and it's just

180
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:59,400
like so much pressure gets thrown on you

181
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:01,560
you know you're and then you start

182
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,150

about this how I've really been doing my

191

brows more out then down because I feel

192
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:22,270
like it gives a lot more eyelid space

Laura's crease as a transition shade

230
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,550

00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:42,400
transition shades of all time

235
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:50,860
shade of Craig crayon an M 210 brush and

236
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:52,900
I'm using this to pull out that outer

237
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:54,880
corner shadow and then also define a

238
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:57,100
decrease a little bit more another grab

239
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:59,320
the Jacqueline hip hop from a morphe one

240
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,430
of both of our all-time clearly clearly

241
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,380
she's all dirty

242
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:04,030
she's been used and loved unless we have

243
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:06,460
another M to ten brushes just a clean

244
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:09,010
one and dip into this red tone and brown

245
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:10,840
shade down here then definitely tap off

246
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:13,330
the fallout as well it's gonna pop this

247
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,160
right in Laura's over V for some

248
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:16,750
definition I'm not making sure that when

249
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,030
I take these shadows I'm pulling them

250
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:20,440
out and winging them as well that's like

251
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:21,729
one of my all-time three things to do

252
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,470
with my makeup you guys know that I love

253
00:08:21,729 --> 00:08:24,400

254
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,990
like my favorite thing in the world and

255
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,130

272
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,390

00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,230

what is your favorite makeup look that

333
00:11:03,099 --> 00:11:09,069
you've ever done on yourself I think I

334
00:11:06,939 --> 00:11:10,869
recently did one with Maya I shoulda

335
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:14,319
palette because as you know like I have

336
00:11:10,869 --> 00:11:16,059
been doing tutorials as much um I've

337
00:11:14,319 --> 00:11:18,639
been reviewing new makeup that's been

338
00:11:16,059 --> 00:11:20,649
launching but one of my favorites for

339
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:22,720
sure is look I actually do have a

340
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:24,879
palette and I actually spent a long long

341
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,559
time doing it I did like a Mac cut

342
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:28,029
crease but like shimmer in the middle of

343
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:30,849
the cut crease it was really intricate

344
00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:33,129
what about you um I know you got some

345
00:11:30,849 --> 00:11:34,929
looks I have sort of definitely some

346
00:11:33,129 --> 00:11:36,879
good luck yes I think that my favorite

347
00:11:34,929 --> 00:11:40,779
whatever was probably my Eclipse look

348
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:42,639
from oh yeah like the food mm-hmm I just

349
00:11:40,779 --> 00:11:43,869
added the came in I have my liquid liner

350
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:45,189
and didn't really use that as a liner I

351
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:47,199
just kind of more fill to end and then

352
00:11:45,189 --> 00:11:50,439
use it to define that crease it was good

353
00:11:47,199 --> 00:11:52,059

00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:08,589
using benefit roller lash of course I am

363
00:12:06,069 --> 00:12:10,239
grabbing the Lily lashes my Emily's

364
00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:11,529
these are my all-time favorite lashes oh

365
00:12:10,239 --> 00:12:13,749
my god so Lourdes is introduced me to

366
00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:16,749
this new lash glue from the Loire called

367
00:12:13,749 --> 00:12:18,459
the lash adhesive and it's the best ever

368
00:12:16,749 --> 00:12:18,910
and I'm so hated to not try this for

369
00:12:18,459 --> 00:12:21,669
myself

370
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:24,339
good it dries out so quickly and like

371
00:12:21,669 --> 00:12:25,629
sticks which never happens because you

372
00:12:24,339 --> 00:12:27,459
guys know every time I put on an eyelash

373
00:12:25,629 --> 00:12:31,149
I was sitting there fumbling with the

374
00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:32,769
freaking inner corner for like 20 that's

375
00:12:31,149 --> 00:12:35,979
everybody there she is

376
00:12:32,769 --> 00:12:38,699
yep that's good ever been out and about

377
00:12:35,979 --> 00:12:41,319
and then your inner corner just pops up

378
00:12:38,699 --> 00:12:42,609
yeah oh yeah that's why I carry law

379
00:12:41,319 --> 00:12:44,079
school at all times I mean that me -

380
00:12:42,609 --> 00:12:45,279

381
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,019
stuff if I'm wearing makeup I always

382
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,669
have oslo and a pair of tweezers and a

383
00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:50,350
Beautyblender and blotting powder and

384
00:12:48,669 --> 00:12:52,029

385
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:53,439

396
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,829

scatterbrain on that same brush and I'm

going to use that to kind of like really

406
00:13:38,289 --> 00:13:41,439
lightly blend together the bronzer and

407
00:13:40,149 --> 00:13:42,909
the highlighter I like doing this a lot

408
00:13:41,439 --> 00:13:44,499
actually using like a more metallic

409
00:13:42,909 --> 00:13:46,149
shade rather than highlighter to blend

410
00:13:44,499 --> 00:13:47,919
together just for like a more subtle

411
00:13:46,149 --> 00:13:52,449
glow also using this shade to highlight

412
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:54,399
