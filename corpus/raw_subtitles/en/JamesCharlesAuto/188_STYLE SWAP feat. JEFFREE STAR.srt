Geoffrey yeah you guys know that I came

107
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:38,420
into this industry pretty fast

108
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:39,769
even though I was so growing as an

109
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,330
influencer I was still a major fan of

110
00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:42,980
all the people that were up there yeah

111
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:44,810
which I didn't even know at the time so

112
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,620
looking back on like ouch like people

113
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:47,690
were a little mean girl

114
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:50,120
so I remember someone I was with was

115
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:51,650
like uh I don't really want you to take

116
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,730

117
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:54,410

just like full-on taking it there so I

124
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:06,680
was excited but it sucks when and I

125
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:08,870
could admit it even at my age that

126
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,819
people do have an influence in like it

127
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:13,160
on you yeah and when someone's in your

128
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:15,170
ear like kind of staying you kind of

129
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,489
follow along we're stuck so I was a

130
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:18,349
follower in a situation that I

131
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:19,970
definitely regret it yeah I mean I

132
00:04:18,349 --> 00:04:21,500
apologize for that night being so short

133
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:23,060
and annoying but you know looking back

134
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,400
I'm like oh my god it's just so high

135
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:27,050
school you know it sucks energy really

136
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,419
is very high school the next thing that

137
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:30,530
happened was a Twitter battle and this

138
00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:33,830
is when I was very small

139
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:34,970
Oh mystery and I was doing a lot of like

140
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,200
the crazy looks all the time that you

141
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:38,150
were just talking about like every day I

142
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:40,610
was pulling out some new look yeah and I

143
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:41,900
wasn't growing as fast as obviously I am

144
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:43,250
now because the thought that I was doing

145
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,360
these crazy creative looks I will admit

146
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,390
I definitely did have a little bit of

147
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,680
like an ego when I first came in ok and

148
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:49,880
lovely a groaner to say that though yeah

149
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,190
yeah absolutely

150
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,930
and in my eyes I was getting frustrated

151
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:55,910
the people like Jeffery or Manny who did

152
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:58,039
more classic lamb were growing and

153
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:59,570
skyrocketing of Fame when I was pulling

154
00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:01,070
out these crazy career books and no one

155
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:02,510
has ever seen before and I was staying

156
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:04,160
at the bottom yeah I remember tweeting

157
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:06,050
asking for my followers to send me ideas

158
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,660
for creative videos or creative makeup

159
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:10,669
look ok yes somebody replied and said

160
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:13,910
like oh do swing inspired by Manny and I

161
00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:17,870
quoted it and literally said girl I said

162
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:19,550
creative you did take it there and I was

163
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:22,130
with Manny at that time and we were

164
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:24,349
sitting in a car going somewhere and oh

165
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:26,570
girl I was it was it was rough

166
00:05:24,349 --> 00:05:28,370
ridiculous and it was so childish but at

167
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:30,200
the time I was literally 16 I just how

168
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,729
about sorority convicts and I had an ego

169
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,360
and I will definitely be able to admit

170
00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:35,030
that now

171
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,979
of course my hurt feelings no it came

172
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:38,150
off very conscious I can't read things

173
00:05:36,979 --> 00:05:39,770
on the internet I can't read how

174
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,789
someone's talking it so it came off a

175
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:42,320
little harsh and I remember you

176
00:05:40,789 --> 00:05:44,690
definitely hurt his feelings no like oh

177
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,950
girl James yeah so I know what's the

178
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:47,810
thing about James at that time me and

179
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:50,210
Manny were just in the car like it was

180
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:52,700
bad once it turned into kind of like a

181
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:54,470
group beef with friends yes I mean know

182
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,330
when people are really friends you're

183
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:57,470
loyal and you want to chime in like what

184
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,909
so I remember me and Joffrey start

185
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:00,200
arguing on Twitter and then you had

186
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:03,020
addressed me and you had talked about

187
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,310
how if I introduced myself to you that

188
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,510
night at the dock on the back call

189
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:08,210
yourself the next big thing of the

190
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:10,130
beauty industry and I was just like wait

191
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:12,020
a sec that

192
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:14,600
I may be a little bit you go testicle

193
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:17,030
but I would never ever ever ever ever

194
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,740
write say that so I was so spooked I

195
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:20,240
instantly had texted Manny trying to

196
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,560
squash the beef I'll apologise but it

197
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,750
was a little bit too late I couldn't

198
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,190
take back what I said yeah a little too

199
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,990
soon like sometimes people aren't ready

200
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:28,760
to hear sorry right away be like get

201
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:30,680
over being angry or like their feelings

202
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,150
which obviously we both can definitely

203
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,250
attest get annoying for snap but it was

204
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,790
a very interesting situation to say the

205
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,590
least

206
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:38,240
hmm but it sucked because I'm like every

207
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:39,620
number to like fix it oh really call you

208
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,990
I was just more on the bane of like okay

209
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:43,580
whatever like you made that coming up

210
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:45,410
Manny you guys can fix it but you guys

211
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:46,790
ended up fixing it yeah obviously I

212
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:48,110
apologize on a personal level too but

213
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:49,100
even in a business sense which I

214
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:51,320
definitely talk about later on in this

215
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,490
video here okay it's stupid to burn

216
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,570
bridges the people in your industry that

217
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:55,160
you're forced to work with and you're

218
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:56,420
forced to see all the time so all the

219
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,550
time I always try to say drama-free

220
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:00,590
which Geoffrey can't relate cannot

221
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:01,880
relate at all times but I think that is

222
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,750
why we're so different and I think

223
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,450
that'll be an interesting conversation

224
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:07,160
later on as well I'm gonna contour okay

225
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:09,380

227
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:14,080
powder it's so boozy that's all you get

228
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:17,120

245
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:54,920
indirect beef with Geoffrey and it was

246
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:56,120
with Nikita yes and one day I was gonna

247
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:58,130
make up forevers party I had gotten

248
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,730
ready and I did a crazy blue glitter

249
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:01,200
look right I wasn't there

250
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,880
you were not there no this is right when

251
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,560
Kylie was first launching her makeup

252
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,700
line yes and I wore a black liquid

253
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,430
lipstick and it was a hundred percent

254
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:09,900
Jefferies there's whether or not I hated

255
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:12,720
him there was no denying that he has a

256
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:14,460
good formula yeah and I tagged it when I

257
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,900
posted an insert picture as Kylie no

258
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,250
shade literally just wanted the kylie

259
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,620
repos I was really close friends with

260
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:21,000
Nikita still AM and she came up to me

261
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,350
and was like talking up my lips and

262
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,760
stuff and talking right look

263
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:25,470
and she's like oh is that like a Jeffrey

264
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,300
weirdo moment crush like she kind of

265
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:29,070
figured she had the best black on the

266
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,930
scene you know is this the Kylie lip but

267
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:33,150
I was like no it's Jefferies and oh you

268
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:33,540
told her that yeah I did think nothing

269
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:35,790
of it

270
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:37,710
Nikita hops right on snapchat and puts

271
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:38,850
her phone in my face it's driving me to

272
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:39,300
hell and back but I'm thinking if the

273
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:41,130
Joe

274
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,630
once the stop had kind of completed I

275
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:43,860
realized oh my god wait this isn't a

276
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:45,360
joke at all and she was like looking

277
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,340
over I said please don't post that like

278
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,270
please do not post that actually here in

279
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:50,520
the snapshots

280
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:52,440
he's saying please do not post that but

281
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,790
she did it went up anyway and I of

282
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,650
course was at the party so I don't know

283
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:57,000
that it went up until two hours later

284
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:58,710
after I had already left and was getting

285
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,780
thousands and thousands and thousands of

286
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:02,730
hate tweets from Nikita's fans from your

287
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:04,110
fans from that whole squad calling me

288
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:05,850
out for being shady and for lying and

289
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:08,430
okay for being just like a shitty person

290
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:10,590
I was so shocked and so upset you're

291
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:13,200
like does he not still be happening yeah

292
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:14,640
so I called Nikita like super scared

293
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,800
alarm like what the heck is going on

294
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,630
like help me Sue's in the club so she

295
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,040
did not get my call finally after like

296
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:21,390
two hours of texting her she finally

297
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:24,800
answered and like we ended up solving

298
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:29,820
and apologizing and resolving it but

299
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:32,430
because like so using my lipsticks but

300
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:34,110
y'all didn't tag it like which I been

301
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:35,130
that before too because same that's the

302
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:36,210
way I talked about this a few times

303
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:37,770
before but that's literally one of the

304
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:39,360
main reasons like rusev asked was

305
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:41,010
because I Allah we cannot afford a lot

306
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,390
of brands makeup so I lied about it and

307
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:43,650
then the brands will repost me I love

308
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:44,730
that we live a market ballin on a budget

309
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:46,500

00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,640
really overwhelming which a lot of

365
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:44,560
people I'm sure you guys can understand

366
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,270
after like just watching us but the one

367
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,860
thing that like is really common with a

368
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:49,660
lot of people in this industry is the

369
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:51,010
fakeness yeah and there's a lot of

370
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:52,660
people who are very very two-faced and

371
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,890
are fake and despite the fact that I did

372
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:56,020
hate Jeffrey for a long time because of

373
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:57,220
really stupid stuff I did always respect

374
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,839
him and always made a note of this one

375
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:00,610
talking about him as well that I not

376
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:02,020
only respected his ability to be blunt

377
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:03,760
and honest but also has a business

378
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:05,649
mindset what's to talk about later but I

379
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,779
think the fact that we were able to just

380
00:12:05,649 --> 00:12:09,610
sit down and just be face-to-face and

381
00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:10,410
just own everything that we have both a

382
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:11,760
dozen barium

383
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:13,590
it was important and it's something that

384
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,610
not a lot of people are able to do it

385
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:15,900
was really really cool I'm really

386
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:17,520
thankful we're able to do it because now

387
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,930
of course we're fine I think the problem

388
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,310
is you have people chime in your ear or

389
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:22,050
you hear something online or someone

390
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:23,430
tells you what James maybe no it's nice

391
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:25,140
to just go with a source like I have

392
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:26,880
James's number we're really cool so if

393
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:28,410
there's any ever a problem was like girl

394
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,670
someone said he maybe has said this and

395
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:31,620
he's like oh just trying to make up some

396
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:33,120
it never said that great have a hope

397
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,650
it'll be a good day like it's so easy to

398
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,820
have a normal conversation and people

399
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:37,770
don't communicate I think in this

400
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:39,540
industry a lot yeah and it's not healthy

401
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:40,980
that's not okay enough with the drama

402
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:43,800
we've had it quite the journey but no

403
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:46,320
yeah we would have no issues for months

404
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:48,060
and probably never again girl adults ok

405
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,710
sister James is testing me right here

406
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,060
with this moment I love it

407
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:52,920
I'm trying to conceal my pink eyebrows

408
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:55,710
I'm scared oh wow I've even really

409
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:58,260
looked up yes now when someone says that

410
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:59,820
brows can only be sisters and not twins

411
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:01,500
can't relate because that's look pretty

412
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:04,410
identical honey they're still sisters

413
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:07,080
though have you ever done like crazy

414
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:08,640
look like this before no oh yeah this is

415
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,260
the first I love that you're taking me

416
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,670
out of my comfort zone we're really just

417
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,800
going there and okay something that's

418
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:15,030
been on my mind is yeah I have seen a

419
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,440
lot of people come and go on this

420
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:19,830
industry right I'm gonna call myself an

421
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:21,630
OG yeah yes and it's really cool to just

422
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:22,980
watch you from far away and see your

423
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:24,840
business sense because there's a lot of

424
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:26,910
people that thank you you know and I

425
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,050
really appreciate and admire how you are

426
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:29,550
about your business at such a young age

427
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:30,810
definitely something that a lot of

428
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:32,520
people should look up to and admire

429
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:34,950
because you don't play around

430
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,600
thank you yeah oh my god hearing that

431
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:38,280
from you honestly means the world

432
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:41,550
I always said and you can ask anybody

433
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:43,440
this I hate Geoffrey but I think that

434
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:45,270
the way you handle yourself although may

435
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,410
not be the most professional sometimes

436
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:47,970
there's a reason you've been around for

437
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:49,200
ten years and are not falling off

438
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:51,330
anytime soon and I think that that's

439
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:54,600
something to really pay attention to oh

440
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:56,700
that flushes wait - it does ha ha -

441
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,440
really pay attention to and sling that

442
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,760
has made me look up to you it's kind of

443
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,140
a role model in the sense

444
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,450
I've just seen so many kids that are my

445
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:04,620
age get into this and grow quickly and

446
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:06,300
then completely throw it away and just

447
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,920
make stupid decisions you know I've

448
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,750
always been thrown who's very calculated

449
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,850
I love numbers I love statistics I love

450
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:13,200
always singles addicting it really is

451
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,790
honestly and I would so much rather be

452
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,900
focusing on that and being brainstorming

453
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:17,190
with my team and seeing what can we

454
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,750
really do next to end everything up

455
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:20,080
rather than like going to a party or

456
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,730
like getting coffee yeah

457
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,320
I just love it because you really remind

458
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:25,029
me of me at a younger age I think what I

459
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:27,130
really admire about how you're handling

460
00:14:25,029 --> 00:14:28,810
things is like you're not overspending

461
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:29,920
like mine is rolling and but you're

462
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:30,970
being really responsible and I don't

463
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,990
know who taught you that whether it's

464
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,740
your parents and you can tell me in a

465
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:34,000
second yeah

466
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:35,470
but it's cool that you're not just being

467
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,360
wild because I've seen so many people

468
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:38,680
come and go in this industry they start

469
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,209
making money and they literally spend at

470
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:42,250
all I think it's gonna it's just like

471
00:14:40,209 --> 00:14:43,630
yeah every month it's like forever and

472
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,740
it's like you know it's good to treat

473
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:46,839
yourself like I love you treat yourself

474
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:49,240
once in a while yeah but you're not

475
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:50,680
being crazy and like irresponsible right

476
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,540
which at your age I can't believe you're

477
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,769
not being amazing

478
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:55,060
once again I've seen so many people do

479
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:57,279
it and I think that's part of the reason

480
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:59,380
why I'm not also like with my family I

481
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,209
didn't grow up poor per se but we

482
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:03,190
definitely didn't have any extra money

483
00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:04,720
at all yeah and I'm mom and dad honestly

484
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:06,220
did a really great job of lying to me my

485
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,810
brother about it and trying to just

486
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:09,130
provide for us in any way that they

487
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:12,070
possibly could to make us happy which

488
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:13,480
still to this day means so much so

489
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:14,560
basically you come along you're saying

490
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,029
like they didn't really tell you the

491
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,010
financials just rip right guys out right

492
00:15:16,029 --> 00:15:19,360
from being a child ed you know has

493
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:20,829
experienced those moment it's cool

494
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,329
because I didn't get that so I'm gonna

495
00:15:20,829 --> 00:15:24,430
share some not it's not dark it's just

496
00:15:22,329 --> 00:15:28,480
you know it's a sick childhood stuff so

497
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:30,579
my mom definitely did not know any of

498
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,899
that stuff she had bad credit she was in

499
00:15:30,579 --> 00:15:33,459
debt when I was young and there was

500
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:35,829
constant like money problems that were

501
00:15:33,459 --> 00:15:37,209
always stressing us out no it's cool

502
00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:39,070
that your parents didn't let you guys

503
00:15:37,209 --> 00:15:40,660
feel that stress yes I remember

504
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:42,279
definitely feeling a lot of that stress

505
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:43,450
I'm very just thankful for the way that

506
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:45,399
I was raised with that in the sense that

507
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:47,589
I did always save my money and I've

508
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:49,120
always been very very like versed in the

509
00:15:47,589 --> 00:15:50,800
technology and like social media area

510
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,910
even yeah a must before like had a

511
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,360
business where I would make stuffed

512
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:56,170
animals of the girl in my school

513
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:58,029
Instagram accounts in the Twitter house

514
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:59,350
I got bored and didn't want to do it

515
00:15:58,029 --> 00:15:59,890
anymore I would just sell it or just

516
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:01,240
move on

517
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:02,350
I met a person where I like to go big or

518
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,370
go home and every project that I'm

519
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:05,620
working on and if I'm not feeling

520
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:06,760
inspired anymore I'm like I'm out yeah

521
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,899
and I'm not gonna waste I'd housing that

522
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,060
I don't care about and when I first

523
00:16:07,899 --> 00:16:11,260
started doing makeup my mom was like oh

524
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:12,760
we were gonna get bored of this in 20

525
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,930
minutes yeah we're not buying you these

526
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:17,279
lights we're not buying you this makeup

527
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:17,279
you're gonna get bored in 20 minutes

528
00:16:18,089 --> 00:16:22,420
surprisingly I'm still here after almost

529
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,010
three years of doing a Thai fans because

530
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:25,540
now that thankfully I have been able to

531
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:27,070
grow in the beauty space I'm constantly

532
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:28,870
challenged with new things and I'm able

533
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:30,160
to kind of keep growing creatively was

534
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:31,839
just really awesome

535
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,620
I like how you were honest last year and

536
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,210
you were like look

537
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:36,250
like I don't want to be someone that

538
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:37,720
just does little bronzy tutorials and

539
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:39,610
reviews like this doesn't get me off

540
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,900
yeah and I love how you were just honest

541
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:42,400
about that like I don't want to be just

542
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,840
a review channel and no tea no shade

543
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,160
because like review channels are awesome

544
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:47,950
when I go to review channels when new

545
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:49,600
products be exactly yeah today we're

546
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:51,310
still consumers as well yeah and I look

547
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,840
to my peers especially taught to eat but

548
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:54,010
abused to see if something that's really

549
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,780
really good in a lot of other channels

550
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:58,150
as well so nothing against them but for

551
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:59,770
me person tin spire me to sit down and

552
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:01,060

553
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:04,750

me to do something that I would normally

never do it myself think it's really

677
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:40,510
cool well I think that's the beauty of

678
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:41,980
this series - it's like it really pushes

679
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:43,390
people out of their comfort zone so like

680
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,530
if I can have my friends do something

681
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:45,130
cool and to have a little fun while

682
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:47,050
doing it

683
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:48,070
y know a lot of my looks like this I

684
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:49,630
always like to add a lot of dimension

685
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:51,880
and a lot of different like colors and

686
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:53,320
pigments and shadows too just so they

687
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,850
like photograph really nicely and also

688
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,990
would you like more than just a makeup

689
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:57,940
look I really these two feel like a

690
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:59,350
piece of art they sure look like one

691
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:02,860
when I saw this year for the first time

692
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:04,570
I was like she did that oh thank you sir

693
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:06,960
I had one thought for you that you need

694
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:09,550
to leave downtown girl I'm well aware I

695
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,230
do to us I am trying I'm trying to buy

696
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:13,090
house which I talked about a few videos

697
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:14,320
ago but oh you did yeah let's get back

698
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:16,780
to the sister update as you guys know

699
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,160
I'm 18 but because I'm 18 I just got a

700
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:20,650
credit card last year for the first time

701
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:22,540
yeah and my account is set up so all my

702
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:23,860
credit card bills get wiped in sleep in

703
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:25,510
my account her my credit score should

704
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:27,310
technically be perfect but because this

705
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:29,230
is my first year credit it's not perfect

706
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:31,090
right when you get a house they averaged

707
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:33,040
together your last two years of income

708
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:34,840
and of course this year with income I

709
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,610
made a lot of money and I've been saving

710
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,390
all my money very wisely I'm really

711
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:39,070
making sure that I keep everything

712
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:41,680
because I have known that I wanted to my

713
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:42,970
house but last year I made nothing okay

714
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,710
not nothing but I made very little

715
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:46,480
compared compared to this year of course

716
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:48,760
and when those two numbers are outfits

717
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,530
together they're not good so clearly I'm

718
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:52,300
stuck in that situation but my best

719
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:54,430
friend's Mother's was actually willing

720
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:56,650
to co-sign on my mortgage with me for a

721
00:21:54,430 --> 00:22:01,240
house which is why insane yeah that's a

722
00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:03,160
big thing yeah but and apparently to

723
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,840
have a cosigner you need three lines of

724
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,430
credit I don't even have one good line

725
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:08,050
of credit how would I ever have three

726
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:09,670
lines of credit on a house which is also

727
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:11,830
so stupid because the point of a

728
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:13,660
cosigner is to adjust your credit yeah

729
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,740
but like so now they're like being in a

730
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:16,570
little impulse so now they're being

731
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:17,980
impossible so it looks like I'm sister

732
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:19,810
stock but at this what I'm trying to

733
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:21,520
figure out anything that I can in five

734
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:23,020
years so now I hope to be moving on to

735
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,310
the next big thing and yes we chilling

736
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:25,750
in my mansion and yeah

737
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:27,400

rains between me and Ian has really

783
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:00,400
brought us closer together because yeah

784
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:01,900
we didn't really help the best childhood

785
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,610
growing up and so many people thought

786
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,990
that I was just using en for views on

787
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:06,700
our videos together which I mean I get

788
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:08,200
it the videos do really well so like I

789
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:10,330
could see where you might think that but

790
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,440
I'm like he's my brother and because we

791
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:13,150
didn't really have the brush childhood

792
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,400
together sorry I'm taking every possible

793
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:16,200
champion

794
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,630
spend time with me carry to the bond

795
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:20,190
yeah and it's in a really amazing strain

796
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:21,600
stress together and I'm so thankful and

797
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:23,070
because of that we have gotten so much

798
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,420
closer we've been talking a lot more and

799
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:26,100
when that happened he actually faced

800
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:27,120
coming in was so upset I was talking to

801
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,680
you about it and I really had a sit him

802
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:31,110
down and be like listen you're gonna

803
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:32,700
lose a lot of friends right yes and it

804
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:34,559
sucks because you think that more people

805
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,940
would come and try to leech off you and

806
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:37,140
of course they will they will you're

807
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,370
also gonna get a lot of people that

808
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,360
don't really care for you and you

809
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:41,520
realize that they were only there for

810
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:44,430
what you had to offer that yeah yeah

811
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:46,110
which is hurtful and you gotta let him

812
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:47,940
go it's well at least he has you to tell

813
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:49,350
him that yeah well I learned that the

814
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,760
hard way and I had so many people that I

815
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:52,320
was close friends with for years on end

816
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:54,420
but I had to cut off for my own

817
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,190
well-being and same in the long run I'm

818
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:57,750
not thankful that I did but it sucked

819
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:59,580
and I remember crying I thought to sleep

820
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:00,660
so many times over it and wishing and

821
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,830
praying that it would be different that

822
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:03,510
I could keep those people in my life but

823
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:05,550
at the end of the day I now don't miss

824
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:05,790
any of them and it sucks to think like

825
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:09,929
that

826
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:11,970
and they gotta be you know it's a grow

827
00:25:09,929 --> 00:25:13,290
some people start to turn a different

828
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:15,000
way or they have a different mindset as

829
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:17,280
you or things has changed and it's

830
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,679
healthy yeah you know alright so the

831
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:22,140
only part I'm a little what's right word

832
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:25,590
sister spooked sister spooked about is

833
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:27,990
the white steepling I want that galaxy

834
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:29,970
effect yeah so while I'm getting there a

835
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:31,500
fluffy brush like that's okay and kind

836
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:32,940
of jiggle it around a little bit got a

837
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,290
little bit messy and I took a white

838
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,460
cream shadow I'm gonna kind of grab it

839
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:36,960
on here we'd have to add a little bit

840
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:40,470
more dimension so that's gonna be like

841
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:42,480
what kind of looks like stars Oh see I

842
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:43,830
was afraid that was too much okay well

843
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,420
no cuz if you go over the law it kind of

844
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:47,220
balances it out there especially if you

845
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:51,840
add in black to the similar effect

846
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:55,050

00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:59,410
of rock your brain from being online for

904
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,210
so long what do you think really

905
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:03,670
separates a creator from being like just

906
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:05,620
a little fad - like a long lasting

907
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:07,540
person oh wow and do you have any advice

908
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:10,240
for me to do that do you think yeah I

909
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:12,190
think you've already learned a lot at

910
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:15,010
your age you yeah I went through what

911
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:17,320
most people go through in like seven

912
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:19,720
years oh yeah in like one same with me

913
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:21,580
yeah like I addressed controversy years

914
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:23,590
ago and then it got Bri brought up ten

915
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:24,760
years later so imagine like imagining

916
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:25,840
you you're like twenty eight you're like

917
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,750
ten years later and someone's still

918
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,970
running a mouth

919
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:31,490
you're like girl it's so far from who

920
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:33,980
you are but it's the Internet nothing

921
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:35,720
goes away right so my advice is really

922
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:37,490
just stay true to who you are which is

923
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:39,740
exactly what you're doing don't get

924
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:41,570
mixed up with any more both than people

925
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:46,100
in our industry I think what's really

926
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:47,450
kept me let's say relevant and current I

927
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,290
mean it's been a long time right we're

928
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:51,410
talking from yeah

929
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:53,660
Friendster to MySpace to Facebook to

930
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:55,510
Instagram to YouTube it's been a wild

931
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:57,260
journey and I've always been very

932
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:59,420
authentic and I've just always been

933
00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:01,100
myself I know it sounds so like boring

934
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:02,390
almost or like bland but yeah I've just

935
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:04,400
never been a different person I've

936
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:05,540
always been me and I've always stuck up

937
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,190

938
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:08,780

that you're discovering yourself right

943
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:17,840

944
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:19,100

00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:22,190

knew you on a personal level and but we

964
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:54,320

00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,570
because there were so many times I

966
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,380

wish you would have okay and I've never

said this out loud before is because a

973
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:11,000
lot of people that were around me were

974
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:12,680
making it worse it takes a real friend

975
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:18,770
to be able to sit there and call you out

976
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:21,080
on your bi yes yeah yeah and I didn't

977
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:23,480
have that really a lot of learning and

978
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,650
that's okay you're never too young or

979
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,090
old to learn I'll tell you that

980
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:28,130
yeah well that's very much my

981
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:30,770
personality as well and like I've i'm

982
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:32,510
definitely blunt and i've definitely can

983
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:34,730
hold out for being a little rude or a

984
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:37,250
little Starkie before to people but in

985
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:38,540
the long run all like what I am that way

986
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:39,920
towards people have sleeve my close

987
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,470
friends yeah even though it may seem

988
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,210
real

989
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:44,010
harsh and kind of like aggressive in the

990
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:45,480
moment it takes a real us friend to be

991
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:47,190
able to say that with confidence know

992
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:50,970
that this is coming from a place of love

993
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:52,620
not hate and not being angry to me I'm

994
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:54,390
the same type of person like I want

995
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:56,100
someone to come to me and be like listen

996
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:57,750
sister love you the most

997
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:59,280
you need to shut up you're being awful

998
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:00,390
right now I'm thankful for those people

999
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:02,190
in my life and I want people to do that

1000
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:03,390
to me so I think that that's why I had

1001
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:05,159
the same nature to do that to other

1002
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:06,870
people cause like I wish I had somebody

1003
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:08,610
to stop me before I tweeted stupid

1004
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:09,960
things but at the end of the day it does

1005
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:11,820
shape us as a person and it really

1006
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,559
allows us to grow and become better but

1007
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:16,049
I find that with that for the people

1008
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:18,120
that are and you're on top of it yeah

1009
00:31:16,049 --> 00:31:19,620
and have your back exactly yeah okay so

1010
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:21,299
we have one last step of course for

1011
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:23,429
every makeup routine yeah of course and

1012
00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:25,409
these looks are iconic so I think we

1013
00:31:23,429 --> 00:31:27,000
have step them in place we sure do we're

1014
00:31:25,409 --> 00:31:28,380
gonna use Jeffrey's morphia presence up
