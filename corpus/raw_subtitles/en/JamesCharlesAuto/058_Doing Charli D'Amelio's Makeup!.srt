62
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,210

65
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:13,200
[Music]

66
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,239
let's go ahead and get started with

67
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,709
moisturizer first I'm going to use it

68
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:17,970
the touch out water cream you already

69
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:18,989

70
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:25,019
I want to make sure it is nice and

71
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:27,450
supple and hydrated supple I just have

72
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:34,260
supple plump and like nice like smooth

73
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:35,430
okay full okay so the one question

74
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,440
Charlie that I want to ask while I'm

75
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:39,930
putting on your foundation is obviously

76
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,909
going from 0 to 36 million followers in

77
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:44,640
the course of a few months is insane

78
00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:45,870
congratulations from annoying you behind

79
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,459
the scenes I know that you're a really

80
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:49,140
really nice person so it's really

81
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:53,400
awesome to like see that you were the

82
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:54,420
one who know what has not been like what

83
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,950
is if I like to just go from like a

84
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,970
normal girl and Connecticut to one of

85
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,420
the biggest influences on the entire

86
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,190
planet

87
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:01,680
um it's weird seeing at how things

88
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:04,049
changed you know people like some people

89
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,730
will try and go live and try and like

90
00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:08,459
talk bad about me trying to make me look

91
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:09,720
like a person that I'm not in a bad way

92
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:12,150
so that's just weird seeing how people

93
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,890
switch up or like people will say like

94
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,060
you cut me off or like you're talking to

95
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:16,650
me and I was like you haven't been

96
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,329
friends for like four years

97
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:20,099
yeah or like they'll make us seem a lot

98
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:20,579
closer than we were in real life that's

99
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:22,680
weird

100
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:24,690
but for the most part like I know who I

101
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,959
can trust and like I have my best friend

102
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:30,120
Gemma back home like nothing has changed

103
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:33,359
yes what about the positives the

104
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:35,459
positives are I'm getting to experience

105
00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:37,950
things that I wouldn't have been able to

106
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:39,840
do if I didn't have this opportunity one

107
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:41,489

00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:31,160
like watching YouTube yeah would you say

131
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:32,600
that like YouTube is kind of what got

132
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,770
you like into social media in the first

133
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,320
place like how did the whole like Tech

134
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:37,640
Talk situation like Star um all my

135
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,110
friends are doing it that's honestly how

136
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,000
I got into a to do whatever everyone's

137
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:43,340
making fun of tick-tock yeah like and I

138
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,010
was too but it was like that's because

139
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:47,300
like dancing wasn't as big on there like

140
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:48,860
it was a lot more like it was the comedy

141
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,660
like lip-syncing yeah oh I name is like

142
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:52,040
musically and then all my friends are

143
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:57,530
doing it they're like Charlie letting

144
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:58,970
these dancing okay they would have me

145
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,890
learn the dances so I could teach it to

146
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:02,960
them so they could do take time and then

147
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:05,090
I was like I'm gonna get one like so

148
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:08,390
much fun I want to do it and then it

149
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:10,940
blew up very quickly which was weird and

150
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:13,100
it was like a pie like 15 videos in

151
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:14,480
which is like nothing yeah

152
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,950
what I love about the poeple is that

153
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,570
everybody has the opportunity to go

154
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:18,890
viral yeah and I think it like that's

155
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:20,750
why I was talking about this earlier

156
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:21,890
today it's hard it took like girl

157
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,660
following on a lot of social media

158
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:25,490
platforms like Instagram algorithms

159
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,840
broken and a million different reasons

160
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:28,670
YouTube very very talented because

161
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,080
everyone wants to be a youtuber Twitter

162
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:32,660
people go viral all the time but like

163
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,310
just a viral post yeah once and a viral

164
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:36,650
post does not translate to like a viral

165
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:38,210
Twitter account but tick tock everyone

166
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,950
has like an equal opportunity to go

167
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:41,810
viral and I want to hear your input on

168
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:43,010
this because of that I feel like there's

169
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:44,630
a far more people that are on checked

170
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:46,310
off that are producing really really

171
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:47,960
good contact because in their heads like

172
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:49,880
okay maybe I'll do this angle

173
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,470
yeah and I mean I get asked that

174
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,150
question all the time did you want to be

175
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:54,380
famous I was like well yeah of course I

176
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:57,440
was thought it was cool to like be a

177
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:59,389
youtuber right do that stuff but I I had

178
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,729
started tick tock like making funny

179
00:05:59,389 --> 00:06:04,460
videos with like my friends like it was

180
00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:06,139
really never meant to be something right

181
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:08,180
it's like I'm gonna do this to get

182
00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:09,850
famous and then like figure my life out

183
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,990
from there like it was such an accident

184
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:14,810
though because all my friends are like

185
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:16,370
we're gonna get famous was like okay how

186
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:18,169
are you gonna face off tick-tock right

187
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:24,199
like a lock or just blending in your

188
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:26,539
concealer and we're only to stuff then I

189
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:28,940
think my own competition because I'm

190
00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:30,080
actually not as bad as you think so how

191
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:32,090
long have you been even dancing since

192
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,380
you were five you said I'm dancing since

193
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,970
I was three been competing since I was

194
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:36,919
five so I obviously didn't have any with

195
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:38,360
Abby Lee Miller this past year I love

196
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:39,740
dance halls I love this like the world

197
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,940
of dance I'm not like super

198
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,169
knowledgeable in it but I've always

199
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,250
found it very very fascinating and I

200
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:48,130
have an immense row to respect for

201
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:50,900
dancers because I suck on it like ah I

202
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:52,159
know my dances are really really bad but

203
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,479
I think like that's one of the reasons

204
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:55,430
why talk it's fun too because you don't

205
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:57,470
have to be like great at it to like have

206
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:59,270
fun you just have fun and that's all

207
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:01,190
that matters but I'm assuming you being

208
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:02,750
a competitive dancer helped a lot in

209
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:04,490
terms like just tick tock and stuff I

210
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:06,949
mean probably I got to pick up the

211
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:09,560
dances really quickly which helped I

212
00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:11,930
literally watched you watch somebody

213
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,159
dance watch it like once and then sit

214
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:14,659
there and record and do it right on the

215
00:07:13,159 --> 00:07:16,099
first try which makes me want to like

216
00:07:14,659 --> 00:07:18,680
literally strangle you because it takes

217
00:07:16,099 --> 00:07:20,240
me at least like at least fifty loops so

218
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,849
if you are still doing a competitive

219
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,409
dance obviously right now like tick tock

220
00:07:22,849 --> 00:07:26,659
is just by thought you have 36 million

221
00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:27,889
followers a new thing for you do you

222
00:07:26,659 --> 00:07:29,419
think that like competitive dance would

223
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:30,860
be something that you would like want to

224
00:07:29,419 --> 00:07:32,360
do is a cup full time job or what do you

225
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,550
want to do for like a career right now

226
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,470
like where's your hot girl right now

227
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:38,449
it's very difficult because I have so

228
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:40,759
many opportunities represented to me

229
00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:42,470
that I'm just trying to like try

230
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:44,810
everything I just did something for

231
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:47,090
voice acting or a movie oh my god that's

232
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:48,320
so cool and I actually really enjoyed it

233
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:50,060
they give us something that I didn't

234
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,830
I was going to like yeah I had a lot of

235
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:53,180
fun with it I would love to do something

236
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:54,680
like that because I tried that a couple

237
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:57,110
days gone and loved it

238
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,150
okay there's just so much fun um dance I

239
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:01,310
obviously want to keep up with dance and

240
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:03,410
continue doing that in training and

241
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:06,130
taking classes in which I can

242
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:10,910
I don't know I'm down to try everything

243
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:12,860
but this is how do you do that with one

244
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:14,510
nostril because I broke my nose are they

245
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:17,270
this year no really I've been waiting to

246
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:20,200
surgery for like since August I'm just

247
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:22,850
you know I shouldn't be able to breathe

248
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,680
so speaking of you getting a bunch of us

249
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:26,180
opportunities you've been everywhere the

250
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,350
past few weeks to spend it really fun to

251
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:29,420
watch but like what was the what we're

252
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:31,850
like okay I've made it okay so

253
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:33,200
definitely JLo saying she like knows who

254
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:36,530
I am and like her kids watch me all the

255
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,510
time I'm like oh her daughter she like

256
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:40,400
just came off performing at the Super

257
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:42,500
Bowl and she was like so excited to meet

258
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,490
me and I was like a joking that's so

259
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,050
cool that's crazy

260
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:46,790
Jalen was like your biggest role model

261
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:48,200
right are you talking about that James

262
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:50,990
Charles supposed to be honest that's

263
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,340
really true this did happen oh he's a

264
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:54,320
big one when I met him he was really

265
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:58,840
worried over it to be honest yes he

266
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:00,830
dropped he checks me I play lies this

267
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:03,260
particular almost the entire makeup that

268
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:04,430
is such a lie I kept getting walls well

269
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,560
that was her personal never been like a

270
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:08,180
big a bat as well right yeah and I was

271
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,160
only there for one day cuz I my flight

272
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:13,130
got delayed great how did you enjoy your

273
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,180
experience of that like it's terrifying

274
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:15,830
it was like going oh there's so many

275
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:17,690
people and then I was like no it's fine

276
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:18,490
they're not gonna come up to me like no

277
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:21,590
one cares about me

278
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:22,790
most I've ever heard I walked out and

279
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:25,730
then there was like a bunch of people

280
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:26,990
there does it go then I felt super cool

281
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,980
do you do well with the crowds and

282
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:30,770
suffer do you like meeting a lot of

283
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:33,140
people I love meeting people I like

284
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:34,340
meeting them in smaller groups yeah some

285
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:36,740
reason because sometimes I'll feel

286
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:38,420
overwhelmed so I try to keep my college

287
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:40,220
which I can but I also get a lot of

288
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:42,020
anxiety when I'm around a lot of people

289
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:43,880
yeah and I come here really scary and

290
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:45,710
you know what I've kind of noticed over

291
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,150
the past a few years especially with me

292
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,350
cuz I used to be the same way like I was

293
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:51,080
always so concerned about whatever

294
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:52,640
people would think but I've like fans

295
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,590
and just like people like viewers in

296
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,770
general have gotten way better about

297
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:59,630
respecting that stuff so I own it uh

298
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:00,040
there's like a growing crowd of people

299
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,839
that are

300
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,339
starting to understand like okay these

301
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,509
like a lot of these influencers I have

302
00:10:03,339 --> 00:10:05,860
like a huge following like this is not

303
00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:07,660
like this is dangerous

304
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:09,250
yeah I mean there's of course the people

305
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:11,470
like that it's mostly the parents that

306
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:13,839
are like yeah straight up with rude like

307
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:15,820
I had a mommy yell at me once I was in

308
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,230
the middle of eating dinner and I was

309
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:19,180
with all my friends and she like called

310
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:21,069
me out specifically and I was like with

311
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:23,199
all my friends and I had a really really

312
00:10:21,069 --> 00:10:25,660
just horrible day and of course no one

313
00:10:23,199 --> 00:10:27,009
knows that I'm not gonna post like me

314
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:29,199
just being upset there's a lot of stuff

315
00:10:27,009 --> 00:10:31,630
going on right and my friend's mom was

316
00:10:29,199 --> 00:10:34,000
like hey we're just going to eat dinner

317
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:35,560
right now do you think you could just we

318
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,449
just to come a minute so they can like

319
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:40,269
eat and are like well she's not gonna

320
00:10:37,449 --> 00:10:42,579
die she doesn't eat right now is she you

321
00:10:40,269 --> 00:10:43,779

take it and she's like you know what

323
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:49,480
this is making you look really bad and I

324
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:51,610
literally crying she was like I have a

325
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:55,930

00:10:55,930 --> 00:11:01,060
what I didn't mean to it was like well

328
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:03,430
you did good and then she was like I'm

329
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:04,870
following and I was like just mean

330
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:07,000

hungry I hadn't eaten all day great and

334
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,050
you have a right to eat that's the one

335
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:15,639
like I love meeting people I will always

336
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:18,100
say pictures people the one time I will

337
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:19,630
always say no is it what I mean a or not

338
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:23,170
always just say we'll come in the back

339
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:24,850
there oh yeah yeah hey I'm so sorry like

340

I'm to the bathroom and they can see the

341
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:30,790
page so like maybe right now I'm always

343
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:34,089

346
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:41,050
I'm really sorry that obviously not

347
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,279
everybody can be a respectful of you

348
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:43,540
it's really it's like one of the worst

349
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:44,829
part about being an influencer

350
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:47,230
I see other things like people post

351
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:49,689
things and then like everyone colonies

352
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:51,310
to like wherever I am sometimes that'll

353
00:11:49,689 --> 00:11:53,110
let go - those are my cousin's wedding

354
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:54,790
you told me about this I can't even

355
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:56,800
believe this actually happened yeah

356
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:58,750
that was like a group of like four girls

357
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,400
who got ready and pretended that they

358
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,960
were cousins with my cousin and that I

359
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,610
think that is literal psychopath

360
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,470
behavior there's no other most of this

361
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:07,420
right back to him and he was like hi

362
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:09,220
guys who are you nice to meet you and

363
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:10,570

364
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:13,120
like oh that's so crazy

365
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:16,180
that's annoying kids are some things

366
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,980
where I want my like privacy and it was

367
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:20,620
like my cousin's wedding with my family

368
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:22,330
not the appropriate time at all so that

369
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:24,940
was like really really weird

370
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:27,370
okay so aside from obviously privacy

371
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:29,500
problems what would you say has been the

372
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:32,200
biggest change from your life beforehand

373
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:36,250
to now just like the day-to-day stuff I

374
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:37,810
can't go out looking like trash if

375
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:40,060
there's people there and then look like

376
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:41,350
trash I'll say it yeah and then it just

377
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,970
like makes the picture I'm comfortable

378
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:45,340
because I know I look bad you don't look

379
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:48,190
bad it's usually when I'm getting coffee

380
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:50,280
to which is my safe do you feel like

381
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:53,500
pressure to always look good you know

382
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:57,790
can I sleep with this one I wouldn't

383
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:59,800
recommend bad but no ever no never

384
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:01,000
I'm taking like an hour-long nap like in

385
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,150
the middle of the day if I'm like in

386
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,760
between days and never something upon

387
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:09,220
ever no do about that it's for your skin

388
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:11,290

00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:12,940
take your makeup off agreed are you done

390
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:18,760

but I wanted to I want you to like it

395
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,820
maybe we should have matched the hoodie

396
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:29,560
I thought could be like a cute little

397
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,640
pastel moment yeah

398
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,600
as we start with this one is gonna be

399
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,920
dipping into some different colors

400
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,580
matching the hoodie I said when I keep

401
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,410
talking cause I have a lot more

402
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,940
questions for you and I have a little

403
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:37,750
bit more like a serious I share that

404
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,790
what you don't hope you answer if you

405
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:41,500
don't want to but I know that you've

406
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:42,610
talked a lot about unlike different

407
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,350
socials and stuff but or anybody isn't

408
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:46,360

409
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:48,310
my favorite era world I know you're

410
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,050
dealing with like a lot I'm doing a lot

411
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:51,880
right now do you feel like you're being

412
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:53,050
pulled and like a million different

413
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,740
directions and how was that like

414
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:55,200
affecting you

415
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:57,060
so you even want to talk about it

416
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,680
ya know I've actually never talked about

417
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:00,210
this and the slightest before I have to

418
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:04,170
beginning when this all started I was

419
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:06,810
very very overwhelmed yeah and I was

420
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:08,880
still going to school and full-time like

421
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:10,080
going to a middle school right like I

422
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,360
was in public school yeah I was

423
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:15,360
traveling a lot I always had something

424
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:17,700
to do and I felt like I just had no free

425
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,220
time and then as time started going on I

426
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:23,520
started doing online school which was

427
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:25,140
great I loved it so much I mean I was

428
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,820
struggling because there were so many

429
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:28,560
things I felt like I had to do and I

430
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,570
felt like I didn't have I really well

431
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,220
put together schedule back then and I

432
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:33,780
just felt like everything I felt like

433
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:35,490
everyone was yelling at me to like get

434
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:36,990
stuff done yeah and I was like I don't

435
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:38,580
know how to do it all cuz I think

436
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:40,800
there's I just feel like there's so many

437
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:43,170
things that I have to do you were my my

438
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:46,200
excuse for most things was like I just

439
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:48,090
did I had no idea right I had stuff to

440
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:50,520
do that I would know about but I'm still

441
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:53,970
obviously a teenager and I would just

442
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:56,160
forget or take a nap or get tired like I

443
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:58,230
was really struggling with that but now

444
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:01,650
associate my family we're a lot better

445
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:04,350
on making sure like oh I have something

446
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:06,900
this day like let's not unpack I just

447
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:08,670
was getting so so so tired we're even

448
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:11,340
for a little bit I realize like my

449
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:13,650
videos were not good because I just are

450
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:15,810
like it wasn't having fun yeah and then

451
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:18,930
took a little bit of a break from

452
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:21,270
everything and stopped so I can focus on

453
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:24,360
myself and then now I'm getting back

454
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:26,670
into the meetings and still doing work

455
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,680
stuff but also being able to do all the

456
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:30,720
fun things and like really getting to

457
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:33,390
sit and enjoy them everything just like

458
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,400
worked out in the best way I'm really

459
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:37,140
glad to say that you're like handling it

460
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,610
better and all of it like when I first

461
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,840
saw your story I think I was horrified

462
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:41,160
for you and like I remember I said

463
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,600
you're really like long message and

464
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,490
stuff just like because I won't do the

465
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,750
same thing obviously you grew way fast

466
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:47,430
knighted and I think just tick tock is

467
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,690
just a different pop from an environment

468
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:50,160
in general but like I have somebody

469
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:52,350
who's like very very business minded I

470
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,390
love being overworked and stuff but at

471
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:56,010
times like it was so because if you

472
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:57,930
don't enjoy that it's obviously like a

473
00:15:56,010 --> 00:16:00,060
recipe for disaster and even for me as

474
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:01,530
someone who did enjoy being over it

475
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,030
there was days where I would go home and

476
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:03,560
just crime

477
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:05,360
to see precisely I just feel like I'm

478
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:07,460
like so overwhelmed it can't handle all

479
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,960
this I my entire life like especially

480
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:10,880
growing up a competition inter and like

481
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,860
having to have not a lot of free time on

482
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,630
my schedule I've been used to like

483
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:16,040
working hard from the second I wake up

484
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:17,390
to the second I go to bed make sure I

485
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:20,150
get all of my stuff done it was just

486
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:21,800
this was so different than anything I've

487
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:23,510
ever done before on a more positive note

488
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,640
now that you are managing your time

489
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:28,070
better what do you like to do for fun

490
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:29,900
aside from making tic TOCs and dancing

491
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:33,770
well I always in really enjoyed painting

492
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:36,350
I mean really I was like mom can you get

493
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:37,790
me like some canvases in PE and so is

494
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:40,400
her painting and I had a lot of fun with

495
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:41,690
it I wasn't that good but it was just

496
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:44,270
something to do

497
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:46,340
mm-hmm when I was like just doing

498
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:47,930
nothing right I got into doing makeup

499
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:50,090
because I was really into art in the

500
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:52,070
first place so I don't get to do that

501
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:53,750
much anymore either but I also I love a

502
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:55,250
good procreate oh man now what it's time

503
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,960
for it lashes now we're having a little

504
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:59,360
bit of a dilemma because I really wanted

505
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:01,250
to do like a natural lash on Charley and

506
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,870
after checking the collection we

507
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:04,430
realized that we don't have ones that's

508
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:06,290
really good I'm clearly a really good

509
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:07,910
beauty girl but like I said obviously

510
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:10,040
I'm a dancer so this is just like a side

511
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:11,450
job yeah so honestly as the makeup

512
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:13,130
artist you should been prepared yeah I

513
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:23,540
know so that's really bad I'll be

514
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:29,060
leaving you a bad review but that looks

515
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:30,650
