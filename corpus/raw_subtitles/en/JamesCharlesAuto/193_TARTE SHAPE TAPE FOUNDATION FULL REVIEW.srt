00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,030
hi sisters James Charles here and

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:04,589
welcome back to my youtube channel

3
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,700
jumping right to the point because

4
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:07,379
today's video is probably going to be

5
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,269
very long and talkative but we're going

6
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:12,300
to be doing a full review of the brand

7
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:13,559
new tart shape tape foundation there's

8
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,969
been so much controversy and drama

9
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:16,350
regarding this launched and I really

10
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:18,720
wasn't sure if it was my position or

11
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,980
place to be talking about it however so

12
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,109
many of you guys asked for a full

13
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,250
interview of the actual product and I

14
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:25,410
definitely want to talk about the launch

15
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,810
because let's be real this is definitely

16
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,189
not tarts best move there are a lot of

17
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,750
problems with this particular launch

18
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:32,759
that we will get into in a few short

19
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,350
seconds I am an influencer that's been

20
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,370
blessed with a very very large platform

21
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,410
and I definitely want to use my voice

22
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,480
for good and I believe this launch was

23
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:41,160
definitely not good so I want to talk

24
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,809
about it with you guys without further

25
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:50,190
ado let's jump right into the review of

26
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:51,360
the tarte safety foundation's just for a

27
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,430
quick little backstory in case you have

28
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,449
no idea what's going on here at the very

29
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,190
end of 2016

30
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:58,469
tarte cosmetics released a concealer

31
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,270
called shave tape it was picked up by

32
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:01,800
both beauty gurus and consumers from all

33
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,149
around the world who quickly fell in

34
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,400
love with it for its full coverage

35
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:08,280
easily blendable formula and by the end

36
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,770
of 2017 it was the world's number one

37
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,840
best-selling concealer a few weeks ago

38
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,220
out of literally nowhere tarte pulses

39
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,390
that the shaved hip concealer was going

40
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,759
to be made into a Tarte shaped ape

41
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,470
foundation and the world was a literal a

42
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,759
shock I live in California and I've

43
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:22,380
never actually experienced a real-life

44
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,150
earthquake since I moved here but I

45
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,650
swear to God I think that on that day

46
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,000
that this foundation was announced I

47
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,560
could feel the ground moving just a

48
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,450
little bit from everybody jumping up and

49
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,670
down from excitement including myself I

50
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,140
was so excited and so ready for this if

51
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,759
you were a true sister you know that I

52
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,340
literally use a shave tape in every

53
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,110
single video it is like the staple of my

54
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,450
makeup routine so I was so ready for

55
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,939
this foundation launch and so is

56
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,920
everybody else and told this picture was

57
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:49,079
posted this photo has since been deleted

58
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,820
from tarts Instagram page but I remember

59
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:52,860
when they posted this my mouth literally

60
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,479
dropped to the floor there's absolutely

61
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,700
no other word to describe this other

62
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,780
than embarrassing tart release two

63
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,700
different formulas of this foundation

64
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,500
for different skin types a matte version

65
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,600
and a hydrating version we'll be testing

66
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,119
out both in a few short minutes but each

67
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,099
version came with 15 different shades

68
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:10,590
now even though 15 shades isn't a lot

69
00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:11,240
there can very easily be a full and

70
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,660
beautiful

71
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:16,730
from very very light to a very very dark

72
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:17,990
the undertones might not be the best in

73
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:20,360
all them but at least there would be a

74
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:22,250
full-on gradient so most people could

75
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,750
find their skin tone if you look at the

76
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,040
photo that Tarte posted however this

77
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:28,040
gradient that I'm talking about is

78
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:31,510
nowhere in sight in the map version

79
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:34,280
there is literally 10 light shades 3

80
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:36,260
borderline medium shades or like light

81
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,330
medium shades and then 2 dark shades

82
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:40,160
just slapped right on at the end and the

83
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:43,520
hydrating one is even worse with

84
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,750
literally 13 light shades and then the

85
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,790
biggest jump I've ever seen in a

86
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:49,040
foundation line and then at just two

87
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:50,480
dark shades at the end just looking at

88
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,940
the swatches again on my phone I think I

89
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:56,390
could probably wear shades number 2 3 4

90
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:58,640
5 6 7 8 9 10 and maybe even shade number

91
00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:00,560
11 if I had a tan and get away with it

92
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,210
matching literally the person's arm who

93
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,490
these foundations is swatch on it does

94
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:07,250
not even have a shade match for them

95
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:08,780
hello it is 2018 and I just cannot wrap

96
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:10,670
my head around how this launch even

97
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:13,550
passed in the first place like whoever

98
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:15,200
put the stamp of approval on this I just

99
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:17,690
want to talk not only is a launch like

100
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,090
this racist but it's just really really

101
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:22,250
stupid morals aside and from a business

102
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:23,990
standpoint women of color equate for

103
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:25,700
eighty percent of all money going into

104
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:28,310
the beauty industry but for some reason

105
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:29,750
they are still overlooked the lack of

106
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:32,090
inclusion is a lose-lose situation

107
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:34,430
because you look dumb and now you're

108
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:36,020
losing money get it together

109
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:37,640
as a makeup artist who happens to be why

110
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:39,710
I definitely recognize that privilege in

111
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,540
this situation I know that I can walk

112
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:42,650
into Sephora and find at least 10

113
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,210
different foundation lines that will

114
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:46,400
have a perfect match for my skin tone

115
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:47,900
but so many people of color cannot say

116
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,520
the same thing I just cannot imagine

117
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,720
what it would feel like to be forgotten

118
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,250
about like that and to be a person of

119
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,750
color and to be so excited for a launch

120
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,980
like this and then to see the shade

121
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,300
range launched and just feel completely

122
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:58,490
excluded and to know that there is

123
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:00,320
nothing even close to your skin tone

124
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:01,880
since all the drama and controversy has

125
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,620
started at Tarte has come on said that

126
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:06,350
they're launching five additional shades

127
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:08,660
to each line but even those shades are

128
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:10,790
all really really dark the line would

129
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:12,560
still be predominantly lighter shades

130
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:13,970
and we haven't even seen the five

131
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,230
additional colors yet so literally if

132
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:17,270
four of them could still be lighter

133
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:18,890
colors at this point they're like six

134
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:20,989
colors that all look exactly the same so

135
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:22,130
might as well just add four more this

136
00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:22,470
announcement came with the classic

137
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:24,450
respond

138
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:26,250
there are a lot of shades still in the

139
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:28,410
works that are taking a lot of our time

140
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,670
and a lot of money but we were so

141
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:31,140
excited about these so we just wanted to

142
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:33,120
get them out ahead of time for you guys

143
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:34,320
they're definitely not wrong in the

144
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,120
sense that developing complexion

145
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,610
products is a timely and expensive

146
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:41,040
process but heart takes influencers on

147
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:42,930
huge brand trips all the time and shave

148
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,610
tape is the world's number one best

149
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:47,310
selling concealer and at twenty dollars

150
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:50,040
a pop we know y'all got money and as

151
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:51,270
consumers we have plenty of time we all

152
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,610
have our favorite foundations that we

153
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:55,590
know and love and use every single day

154
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:57,510
and nobody was even excited about this

155
00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:00,120
launch until it was announced just a few

156
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:01,290
weeks ago tart really easily could have

157
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,030
worked on perfecting their shade range

158
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:04,590
to be a fully inclusive over the next

159
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:06,360
few months and then launch them all

160
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:08,040
together at once we've already waited

161
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,690
for over a year for this foundation to

162
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,040
launch we could wait a few more months

163
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:13,110
if that means everybody would be able to

164
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:15,180
try it out simply put people of color

165
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:16,320
should not be an afterthought I want to

166
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,450
make it very clear that the point of

167
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,830
this video is not to bash tar I'm

168
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:21,690
definitely someone in the past who has

169
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:23,550
also come under fire for racial things

170
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:24,870
but I can tell you firsthand that the

171
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,520
way to fight ignorant is not through

172
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:28,740
actually fighting it it's through

173
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,600
education hopefully by myself other

174
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,220
Beauty influencers and the thousands of

175
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,810
customers speaking up and using their

176
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,640
voice for good about this issue

177
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:37,080
tark realizes what they did was very

178
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,700
very wrong and they'll work in the

179
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,130
future to be a much more inclusive and

180
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,690
diverse brand I am a makeup Channel and

181
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:44,910
the whole point of doing a review is to

182
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:46,380
test out an actual makeup product I will

183
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:47,910
be putting this foundation on my skin

184
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:50,280
today and seeing how it looks how it

185
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:52,169
wears and how it feels but no matter

186
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,520
what the results of this review are I

187
00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:55,380
want you to know that I do not support

188
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,120
this foundation I'm gonna wear this once

189
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,620
and I will not feature the tart shaped a

190
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,990
foundation again on my channel unless

191
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:02,490
the shade range is massively expanded

192
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:04,410
now that I have all my thoughts and

193
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:05,669
opinions on the table let's go ahead and

194
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:07,770
see what the real TIA is on the

195
00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:09,240
foundation so as I said before Tarte

196
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:11,940
launched two different formulas each

197
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,370
with 15 different shades a match formula

198
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:17,280
and a more hydrating formula now these

199
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:20,100
foundations retail for $39 each and each

200
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,570
come with 30 milliliters or one fluid

201
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,490
ounce of product which is honestly

202
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:25,560
average and very very comparable to many

203
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:27,060
of the other most popular foundations on

204
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,960
the market thar sent over three

205
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,940
different shades that they thought would

206
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,890
match me best in a PR package but I

207
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:33,230
wasn't sure if these were glia and PR so

208
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:35,360
I actually ordered them on

209
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:36,890
as well so I have four different shades

210
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,060
to try out for today and see which one

211
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:40,850
matches me best

212
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:43,700
this is light/medium honey this is fair

213
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:46,220
light neutral a little bit light for me

214
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:48,800
I think flashlights Mary is shaking this

215
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:50,930
is light neutral and this is light

216
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,490
medium neutral looking at all four of

217
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:54,470
these colors completely dried down I'm

218
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:56,090
gonna go with light neutral as my shade

219
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:58,640
today I'm gonna go ahead and apply it

220
00:06:56,090 --> 00:07:01,820
the matte foundation to the left side of

221
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:03,500
my face just like always it has a doe

222
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:05,570
foot applicator similar to shave tape

223
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,070
which I actually honestly really really

224
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:08,360
like for a foundation

225
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:10,040
I definitely been having some skin

226
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,930
issues recently and Shay tape is very

227
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,520
known for being a full coverage so

228
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:15,380
hopefully that'll reign true with this

229
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,880
foundation because lord knows we could

230
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,960
use some coverage right now I'm just

231
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,580
gonna blend the matte foundation in

232
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,500
using my normal beauty blender thar sent

233
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,940
over their brand new blending sponge and

234
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,130
also this brush to blend the foundation

235
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,840
in but I personally can really not stand

236
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:28,160
when brands do that I definitely should

237
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,200
not have to spend extra money on

238
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,070
products just to blend in and use my

239
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,870
foundation

240
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:34,730
okay well that's actually dried down are

241
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:37,400
really really fast it's not even like

242
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:42,580
blending in that easily

243
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:44,870
[Music]

244
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:46,070
this foundation definitely oxidizes a

245
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:47,540
little bit I think because as you can

246
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:48,950
see when I'm applying it I just applied

247
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,750
a little bit more over my beard area for

248
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:54,250
some more coverage it definitely goes on

249
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:56,330
way lighter than it dries down up here

250
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:58,970
interesting looking in the mirror and

251
00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:00,170
honestly underwhelmed my skin looks fine

252
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:02,420
it definitely did a really good job of

253
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:04,130
evening everything out it is very very

254
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:05,780
full coverage light the claim says which

255
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:07,820
is great but I feel like I was like

256
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:09,860
really ready to just be shuck out of my

257
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,330
mind with this foundation because shave

258
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,770
tape let's be real literally change to

259
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:14,960
makeup game for so many people including

260
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:16,820
myself but this just feels like a normal

261
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,320
everyday foundation to me okay woah

262
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:20,060
touching my face the foundation is

263
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,590
already almost completely dry I feel

264
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:23,780
like I might not even need to start this

265
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:25,160
with translucent setting powder I'm

266
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:26,450
spooked mcgoofy

267
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,190
I can already tell you that this

268
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:30,650
foundation is probably not gonna be

269
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:32,630
ideal for people with a very very dry

270
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:34,580
skin I have oily skin and the fact that

271
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:36,500
this still dry down is a little bit

272
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,880
alarming but there is still the

273
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,650
hydrating formula which does not write

274
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,540
down as much has a light to medium

275
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:43,040
coverage finish and contains hyaluronic

276
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:45,200
acid for those of you guys who want to

277
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,070
have a more moisturize Foundation brace

278
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,080
I know I def

279
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:49,190
love a go to do a skin look and this

280
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,440
might be a little bit better for those

281
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:53,240
you guys who have dry skin so I'm gonna

282
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,370
grab this same exact shade light neutral

283
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,860
and apply that to the right side of my

284
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:59,540
face okay wow so even just applying this

285
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:01,730
foundation it definitely has a way

286
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:03,260
different consistency I would say that

287
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:04,820
the matte foundation honestly feels a

288
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,380
lot like the regular shave tape

289
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:08,240
concealer it definitely has a very very

290
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:09,500
thick consistency that we're all used to

291
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,740
but I would say that the hydrating

292
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:15,740
formula it's more of like a gel / watery

293
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:20,600
type formula it definitely feels more

294
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:21,490
lightweight oh my god the color

295
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,720
difference

296
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:25,040
flashback mary says hi are you kidding

297
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,330
what oh my god

298
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,490
I'm gonna blend this side out as well

299
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:30,400
using a Beauty Blender this one

300
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:32,420
definitely does have a more hydrating

301
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,100
consistency my skin definitely does look

302
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:35,750
a little bit more dewy a little bit more

303
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,790
radiant I feel like they're probably

304
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:40,220
going for a your skin about better type

305
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:42,080
of foundation my skin tone is even out a

306
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:43,550
little bit but you can definitely still

307
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,500
see my natural skin it coming through

308
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:47,120
from underneath I actually do not like

309
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,470
how my skin looks on the hydrated side

310
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,810
and all right now I feel like the

311
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:53,270
texture is very very intense I can very

312
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:55,340
much see all my pores in this region and

313
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:58,400
as well as my acne on my forehead is

314
00:09:55,340 --> 00:10:00,050
looking not the best that's for sure

315
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,220
since this is both a shave tape and a

316
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:02,450
foundation review I feel like it would

317
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:04,610
only be right to use the same tape

318
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:06,740
concealer like normal to finish off my

319
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:07,820
base today I'm gonna apply this just as

320
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,240
normal and all the high points in my

321
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,880
face

322
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,800
and I'm using the shade light sand okay

323
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,750
well this is actually really hard to

324
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,370
blend on the matte side this foundation

325
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:18,990
definitely did not lie when it says it

326
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:22,840
dries down

327
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:22,840
[Music]

328
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:27,850
now that concealers all blended out I'm

329
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:29,170
just gonna powder as always using my

330
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:30,730
Laura Mercier translucent setting powder

331
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:34,029
and I'm gonna first start off by packing

332
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:38,050
that underneath my eyes on both sides

333
00:10:34,029 --> 00:10:39,940
and then just going over my nose because

334
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:41,920
Lord knows that that gets pretty oily

335
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:44,110
and wearing a hydrating foundation has

336
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,459
me a little bit scared at this point I'm

337
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:47,019
also gonna plop that right in the middle

338
00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:47,980
of my forehead days to everything in

339
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:50,380
place and make sure I don't get any

340
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:52,269
creases and then just use the excess on

341
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:55,660
the rest of my face it's just to lock

342
00:10:52,269 --> 00:10:56,829
everything in place okay guys so that is

343
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:58,630
the foundation all of height and

344
00:10:56,829 --> 00:11:00,220
completely set in place I will say

345
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:02,500
looking in the mirror the two sides now

346
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:03,910
look almost exactly identical there was

347
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:06,310
clearly a huge difference when applying

348
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:08,620
this side dry down matte real quick and

349
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:10,149
the side was very very hydrated but with

350
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,810
the addition of powder they look really

351
00:11:10,149 --> 00:11:12,430
really similar

352
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:14,079
who knows that may change throughout the

353
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:15,699
next few hours during wearing it this

354
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,470
side may wear down up much much quicker

355
00:11:15,699 --> 00:11:19,360
but I really have no idea we're gonna

356
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:20,290
have to find out all that being said I'm

357
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,730
gonna go ahead and finish the rest my

358
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:23,139
makeup off camera and I'll be right back

359
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:26,019
to show you guys the finished look and

360
00:11:23,139 --> 00:11:27,910
my final thoughts all right sisters

361
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:30,850
hello I am back it has been about three

362
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:33,220
hours three hours now since I last left

363
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:34,300
you guys I finished up my makeup clearly

364
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:36,069
as you can see I went a little bit crazy

365
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:38,019
with my look today but I honestly love

366
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:40,120
how this turned out I'm not going to

367
00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:41,769
play with color in so long and this look

368
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:44,079
is literally stunning just in case

369
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:45,310
you're wondering I use the morphe 35c

370
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,560
palette you guys know you can use coach

371
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:50,620
James for 10% off and now with this eye

372
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,670
look mermaids are shaking back to the

373
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,990
point of this video we're talking about

374
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,550
foundation today and I think I have

375
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:56,290
finally gathered my final thoughts for

376
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:57,760
you guys when I first heard that Tarte

377
00:11:56,290 --> 00:12:00,610
was releasing a foundation version of

378
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:03,100
the iconic shape tape concealer I was so

379
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:04,810
beyond excited I was honestly ready to

380
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:06,220
have this be my new holy grail product I

381
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:07,899
was ready to throw my Too Faced Born

382
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:09,430
This Way literally out the window and

383
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:11,620
have it be my new favorite foundation

384
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:13,540
but not gonna lie after trying the

385
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:14,680
sounds today I'm underwhelmed

386
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:16,420
I think the matte foundation does

387
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,250
exactly what it claims to do it is very

388
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:20,019
very full coverage as you can see my

389
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:22,360
skin tone is very very even which I love

390
00:12:20,019 --> 00:12:24,339
my under eye bags a 5 o'clock shadow and

391
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,779
acne is pretty much all even out and

392
00:12:24,339 --> 00:12:27,399
covered over which is great because

393
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:29,439
clearly we have a lot going on on the

394
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:30,939
face right now the one thing that I will

395
00:12:29,439 --> 00:12:32,380
say that I don't really love about the

396
00:12:30,939 --> 00:12:35,440
matte foundation is that when it says it

397
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:38,710
dries down matte it dries down

398
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,780
real real Matt while applying it it was

399
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:42,490
actually drying down as I put it on my

400
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:44,050
face so when I went into my Beauty

401
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:46,300
Blender I almost could barely even blend

402
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:47,950
in because it was literally already dry

403
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,330
if you're someone like me who has only

404
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:51,370
skin I think that this foundation would

405
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:52,810
be passable for you being that both the

406
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:54,040
oils on my skin and the dryness of the

407
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:55,300
foundation are kind of like fighting

408
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,790
against each other to create like a

409
00:12:55,300 --> 00:13:00,010
pretty good base but if you have normal

410
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:02,320
or dry skin this is gonna be a major

411
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:03,790
major no for you you probably are gonna

412
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,460
look like vanilla cake mix and that is

413
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:07,750
obviously never the move so look to the

414
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:09,430
matte side I believe that the hydrating

415
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:11,320
formula pretty much does exactly as it

416
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:12,940
claims to us well it is definitely a

417
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,440
more medium coverage rather than full

418
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,940
coverage it did a really great job of

419
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,710
evening out my skin tone which obviously

420
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:19,570
we want in a foundation but there is a

421
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:20,950
little bit more of my skin up peeking

422
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:23,410
through I'm pretty lucky to usually have

423
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:25,360
really really smooth skin and texture is

424
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:26,980
usually not a big problem for me I'm not

425
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,270
gonna discuss my forehead region because

426
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:30,340
clearly we have a little bit of a

427
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:32,680
situation going on up there right now

428
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:34,210
but on the side of my nose and in this

429
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:36,850
region like on my cheek where my pores

430
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:38,320
are my texture actually looks pretty bad

431
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:39,460
I really don't even have that big of

432
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,660
pores but for some reason this

433
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:42,340
foundation I feel like is making them

434
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:44,200
look really really large and definitely

435
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:45,850
emphasizing them which is never fun and

436
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,680
the size of my nose actually looks

437
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:49,270
pretty rough which I feel like is kind

438
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,920
of just trumping my whole nose contour

439
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:52,360
which you guys know it's absolutely

440
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:55,000
vital to my makeup routine so I'm really

441
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:57,070
not loving how this region looks on the

442
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,450
hydrating side after testing and wearing

443
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:00,760
both of the Tarte shape key foundations

444
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:02,110
I will say that I do like them I think

445
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,370
it works beautifully on the skin and

446
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:05,290
would be a really really great full

447
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:06,460
coverage option to all of you guys but I

448
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:07,930
just simply don't fear control

449
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:09,460
recommending a foundation that has a

450
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,320
shade range that so many of you guys are

451
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:12,550
excluded from if you do decide to check

452
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,170
out this foundation that is totally up

453
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:15,520
to you I honestly cannot control you or

454
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:17,080
tell you how to spend your money at

455
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,339
least you know in this case that if you

456
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,360
are spending your hard-earned coins on

457
00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:21,550
this that you're getting a good product

458
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,110
in return but for me personally I will

459
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:25,000
not be using this again or promoting it

460
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:26,410
on my channel until tart decides to

461
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,210
diversify and make their shade range

462
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:30,030
more inclusive because as it stands

463
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:32,380
right now it is very very embarrassing

464
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:34,120
turn I love you guys that I know so many

465
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:36,280
avid Beauty fans out there really really

466
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:38,500
love you as well we are rooting for you

467
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:40,900
we were all rooting for you but this

468
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,250
launch was a major major disappointment

469
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,420
I really hope you guys are able to take

470
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:45,400
all this feedback and constructive

471
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:47,320
criticism into consideration for future

472
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,460
launches there's so many people of color

473
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,970
out there who would love to rock your

474
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,980
products but

475
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:53,529
let's be real a lot of the products are

476
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:54,910
really really bomb and I hope you guys

477
00:14:53,529 --> 00:14:56,620
are able to take this situation and

478
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:57,970
learn from it and do better

479
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:59,170
