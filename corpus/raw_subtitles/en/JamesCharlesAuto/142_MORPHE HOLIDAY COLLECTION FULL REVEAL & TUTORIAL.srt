coupon code for them on one of my

30
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:53,129
hoodie's but I really do love them as

31
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,780
both a brand and their products I think

32
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:56,850
they're really really great and this is

33
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,559
more B's first ever big big launch like

34
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,199
this and I had the absolute honor of

35
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,989
being able to actually model for the

36
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:06,030
collection and it was so so much fun so

37
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:07,650
without further ado if you want to see

38
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,180
all the new holiday items and how I

39
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,880
created this eyeshadow look today using

40
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:17,759
the Brady with 39a palette make sure you

41
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:20,070
keep on watching so a few days ago I got

42
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,500
a rather large package sent to my

43
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:24,299
doorstep and when I opened it up it came

44
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,430
with this then it literally cannot even

45
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:27,930
fit fully on the camera but this is the

46
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,030
pr package the morphe Holiday Collection

47
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,380
came in before we even get into the

48
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,299
actual products let's talk about this

49
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,159
freaking packaging because this is

50
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:36,420
absolutely stunning a lot of people

51
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:38,189
complained in the past about more V's

52
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,869
packaging being very very cheap looking

53
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:41,880
and I do not think that that argument is

54
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:43,259
if I want to make it all anymore there

55
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,590
are new stuff and new design and

56
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:47,729
products look so so good I've been so so

57
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,990
proud to watch them grow from the

58
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:51,060
beginning to where they are now it is

59
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,020
truly so exciting okay so looking at

60
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,450
this entire collection in front of me

61
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,829
there are a lot of things you have more

62
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,600
people's definitely not playing around

63
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:59,939
they said girl your stockings are going

64
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,740
to be stuffed let's go to knock out the

65
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:03,000
brush collections first so the first

66
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,880
thing I want to show you guys is the I

67
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,079
still a six piece brushed collection now

68
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,090
before we even talk about the actual

69
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:12,060
brushes inside once again the name

70
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,920
isolates so good the packaging off

71
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,940
stunning so opening us up you get six

72
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,620
different brushes for doing your

73
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,540
eyeshadow with and also a cute little

74
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,500
gold bag to store them all in I do not

75
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,390
even know this is a part of the

76
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,530
collection so cute you definitely have a

77
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,340
lot to talk about here so I'm just gonna

78
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,319
go through these drawers there quickly

79
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,569
but there is a tiny brush for doing

80
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:28,830
winged liner a pencil brush which you

81
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:29,910
guys know I always love to do for

82
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:31,650
highlighting my nose

83
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:34,200
but in our chorus my brow bones or any

84
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,760
detail work on the eyes of course a flat

85
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,319
top concealer brush for any cleanup work

86
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,760
I love using one of these to clean up

87
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:40,380
underneath my brows or sometimes my

88
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,270
winged liner or even my lip line if it's

89
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,830
looking a little bit wonky we have a

90
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:46,290
fluffy Packer brush which is perfect for

91
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:48,840
packing on any eyeshadow to the lid then

92
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:50,580
of course a fluffy blending brush whoo

93
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,080
that's a mouthful right there this will

94
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,700
be perfect for applying shadow into the

95
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,410
crease and on the eyelid and then of

96
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,000
course blending it out as well and then

97
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:58,530
of course a fluffy synthetic brush I

98
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,880
absolutely love using these for when it

99
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:01,830
comes to like blending work that needs

100
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,750
to be done a little bit more soft that

101
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:05,250
makes sense for instance like blending

102
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,600
out a nose contour or blending out a

103
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,610
shadow that's already applied like with

104
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,080
no product on it or I also use one of

105
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:12,510
these for blending out my eyelid primer

106
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,250
all the time so that is the ice layer

107
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:16,019
brush collection like I said it is a six

108
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,190
piece collection I'm gonna put the price

109
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:18,480
of it right down here so you guys can

110
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,860
see it because I don't know the prices

111
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,030
off the top of my head I think it

112
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,260
definitely has every different type of

113
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,670
brush that you would ever need to start

114
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,049
off and I sort of look so thinks it

115
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,820
would be a really really great look for

116
00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:28,980
beginners so the next brush that is

117
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:30,930
called complexion goals in one skin the

118
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:33,150
packaging is so beyond beautiful and

119
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:34,650
this a five piece brush collection and

120
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,630
based on the name and the size of this

121
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:39,390
box I'm assuming this one is going to be

122
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:41,130
for skin and complexion style brushes

123
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:42,420
okay so opening this up once again we

124
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:43,890
get a cute little brush case and then of

125
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,900
course we have the five brushes that the

126
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,950
complexion collection comes with so

127
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,329
starting off in the order that I would

128
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:50,010
use them in we first have a flat top

129
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:52,230
kabuki brush physically perfect for

130
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:54,720
blending in your foundation and it is so

131
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:56,160
so soft next we have a fluffy a rounded

132
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,600
brush and I would use this to set my

133
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,350
face in place using a translucent

134
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,700
setting powder

135
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:02,040
nice to have this a fluffy angle brush

136
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,390
and I would use this to contour so I put

137
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,220
it right here just has all my cheekbones

138
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:07,500
of course we have two snaps a jawline

139
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,790
and the forehead as well so after I

140
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,410
contour you guys know that I like to

141
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:12,510
lightly bake my face a little bit after

142
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:15,600
baking I would go into this next fluffy

143
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:17,400
tapered rounded blending brush whoa and

144
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,440
use this to a whiteboy the baked or

145
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,580
deepen up my contours a little bit and

146
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,109
lastly finally not least we have of

147
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:23,510
course the classic fan brush which

148
00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:25,280
everybody uses to highlight

149
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:26,840
get that blinding glow all right guys

150
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,790
that is the complexion of goals brush

151
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,020
collection all complete like I said it

152
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:31,910
is day five piece of brush - and I'll

153
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,350
put the price right down here I think

154
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:34,910
this is once again a really great set

155
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:36,890
for any beginner who likes to focus on

156
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:38,240
their skin I know my skin used to be a

157
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:39,620
really really big problem spot

158
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,150
especially when it came to my makeup and

159
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:42,200
I've been working so hard on it and it's

160
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,730
finally in a place that I'm like

161
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,170
relatively happy with so I would

162
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:46,220
definitely recommend this brush that to

163
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:49,160
anybody who wants to really have that

164
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:51,080
slate it's matched porcelain face tuned

165
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,330
in real life looking skin alright so

166
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,140
last but certainly not least brush

167
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:56,900
clicks that I want to tell you guys

168
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:58,730
about today is the bling it on brush

169
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,260
collection opening this case up you get

170
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:01,520
once again a cute little storage thing

171
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:03,830
and this is more of like a rose gold

172
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,690
envelope I think it is so cute and then

173
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:07,850
opening this up you fold this little

174
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:09,320
slope up and you get little individual

175
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,910
compartments for all your brushes so you

176
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,470
can keep them super neat and organized

177
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,850
so this right here is a seven piece of

178
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:15,260
brush collection it comes with three

179
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:17,450
different face brushes and four

180
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:21,080
different eye brushes and these retail

181
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:22,490
for a whopping $79 I know that price tag

182
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:24,260
is definitely a really really high it

183
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:26,060
but these are definitely a collector's

184
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:27,800
item these are rolls called brushes and

185
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:29,270
then they have the cute little crystal

186
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,690

187
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,620
stunning

188
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,880

189
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,680
collector's item I would not recommend

190
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:35,120

216

bronze e copper shade then the same

217
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,790
exact thing comes in the set pure nude

218
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,800
but this is the eyeshadow trio comes

219
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:29,420
with instead and is like a brownie

more natural everyday on-the-go

223
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,050
eyeshadow look I think these scents are

224
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:36,529
gonna be perfect for anybody who was

225
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:38,209
born

226
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:40,159
it's makeup or a beginner it's literally

227
00:06:38,209 --> 00:06:41,299
$15 for a five piece set of everything

228
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:43,339
you could possibly need for either a

229
00:06:41,299 --> 00:06:45,019
smoky eye or a more natural all right

230
00:06:43,339 --> 00:06:46,039
finally we get to open to the eyeshadow

231
00:06:45,019 --> 00:06:47,689
which is what I know all of you guys

232
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:49,699
have been waiting for and I'm so pumped

233
00:06:47,689 --> 00:06:51,409
for before we actually get into the main

234
00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:53,539
star of the show though we have two

235
00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:55,489
smaller palettes being the night master

236
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:57,499
and the day it's layer so this is the

237
00:06:55,489 --> 00:06:59,719
base layer palette it comes with 15

238
00:06:57,499 --> 00:07:01,669
different shades and retails for $15 so

239
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:03,169
definitely super super cheap it has a

240
00:07:01,669 --> 00:07:04,819
mirror at the top as well which a lot of

241
00:07:03,169 --> 00:07:07,609
morphe problems that don't have so thank

242
00:07:04,819 --> 00:07:08,839
God they out of this it is so incredibly

243
00:07:07,609 --> 00:07:10,609
helpful that you can do your makeup on

244
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:12,589
the go and this palette comes with a lot

245
00:07:10,609 --> 00:07:14,179
of warm tone shade such as oranges than

246
00:07:12,589 --> 00:07:16,159
the classic Browns and then we even have

247
00:07:14,179 --> 00:07:17,599
any more like ready burnt shade to put

248
00:07:16,159 --> 00:07:19,489
on top of the lid definitely a beautiful

249
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,199
mix of mattes and metallics and I think

250
00:07:19,489 --> 00:07:23,239
this one is kind of comparable to the 35

251
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,769
oh just a fewer shades for a more

252
00:07:23,239 --> 00:07:26,539
concentrated look obviously not

253
00:07:24,769 --> 00:07:27,739
everybody can carry around some huge ass

254
00:07:26,539 --> 00:07:29,389
palette with them so I think this is a

255
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:30,859
really really great palette for travel

256
00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:32,689
and then just like the dates later we

257
00:07:30,859 --> 00:07:35,269
have the night master palette once again

258
00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:36,769
this one is $15 for 15 shades and this

259
00:07:35,269 --> 00:07:39,019
palette is more a cool tone with like

260
00:07:36,769 --> 00:07:40,789
Browns still a few orangie tones up and

261
00:07:39,019 --> 00:07:42,709
here but also the more purpley cranberry

262
00:07:40,789 --> 00:07:44,599
tones for a more night on the town a

263
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:45,949
type of look finally the palette that

264
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:49,939
I've been so excited to tell you about

265
00:07:45,949 --> 00:07:51,979
is the 39a which is the dare to create

266
00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:53,209
palette so this is the 30 on a right

267
00:07:51,979 --> 00:07:54,889
here and if you'll notice it is much

268
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:58,929
bigger than the typical morphe palette

269
00:07:54,889 --> 00:08:01,699
that's because if you open it up this is

270
00:07:58,929 --> 00:08:04,959
what you have inside most morphe palette

271
00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:07,219
retail for $22 and have seven rows of

272
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:09,079
five-minute oh five rows of seven

273
00:08:07,219 --> 00:08:10,219
shadows that's right and this pot is

274
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:11,989
definitely a lot different than the

275
00:08:10,219 --> 00:08:14,389
typical morphe palette this one retails

276
00:08:11,989 --> 00:08:16,729
for $32 and it comes with 39 shades

277
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:19,639
instead of 35 but as you'll notice the

278
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:21,649
middle row of this palette is all bigger

279
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:23,779
than the average pen size and these are

280
00:08:21,649 --> 00:08:24,919
all transition shades I think this

281
00:08:23,779 --> 00:08:26,419
Polly's absolute do this because not

282
00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:27,679
only are there literally seven different

283
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:29,959
transition shades for seven different

284
00:08:27,679 --> 00:08:31,729
skin tones or seven different looks the

285
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:33,469
pan sizes are also a lot bigger because

286
00:08:31,729 --> 00:08:35,029
y'all know as soon as you get that

287
00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:36,800
palette that you really really love the

288
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:38,029
first shade you're gonna hit pan on is

289
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,159
it transition shade because you use it

290
00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:41,779
all the time trust me it happens to me

291
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,759
all the time so I think it is so smart

292
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:45,199
to make the transition shades bigger so

293
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:46,639
you never pan on them and you can use

294
00:08:45,199 --> 00:08:48,319
them and love them forever without

295
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:49,779
further adieu I'm exhausted at talking

296
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:51,759
at this point y'all are probably getting

297
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:53,560
tired of hearing my voice so let's are

298
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:55,420
playing with these shadows so first

299
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,310
program in the shader to find me on the

300
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:59,170
light fluffy brush from the ice lay a

301
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:01,149
brush kit and putting that in at my

302
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:02,199
crease as a transition shade I'm just

303
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:03,730
putting this shade all over my crease to

304
00:09:02,199 --> 00:09:05,439
get a light wash of color on there to

305
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:07,300
prepare for all the shadows coming soon

306
00:09:05,439 --> 00:09:08,620
I'm not gonna grab the shade of vivid on

307
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,089
that flat pack or brush on the same

308
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:11,410
brush set and use this too to find out

309
00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:12,730
the crease a little bit more I'm gonna

310
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:14,199
do a little bit of a halo eyes today so

311
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:16,059
when it comes to the crease I'm keeping

312
00:09:14,199 --> 00:09:17,620
it pretty rounded and when I get to the

313
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:19,809
outer corner I'm not pulling it out and

314
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:21,430
winging it as much as I usually do you

315
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:23,499
guys know that I love doing that so this

316
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:24,670
is pretty hard for me but I think the

317
00:09:23,499 --> 00:09:27,550
rounded I steep is gonna be beautiful

318
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:29,019
for today's look next under grab at 514

319
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:30,730
brush and dip into the shades passion

320
00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:34,050
and vibrant and just mix them together

321
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:34,050
to deepen up the crease a little bit

322
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,230
next time to grab that flat Packer brush

323
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:40,209
that once again I use to to find the

324
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:42,699
crease and grab the shade thick goal and

325
00:09:40,209 --> 00:09:44,170
start to pack that on the lid I can

326
00:09:42,699 --> 00:09:46,149
honestly say I think it has been a month

327
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:47,920
since I've lost use green eyeshadow I

328
00:09:46,149 --> 00:09:49,600
don't really light the color green but

329
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,189
these clubs in this palette are so

330
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,319
beautiful and it is perfect for holiday

331
00:09:51,189 --> 00:09:56,470
season so I figured I would suck it up

332
00:09:53,319 --> 00:09:59,019
and create a bomb-ass slang camo green

333
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:00,189
look today just for you guys I cannot

334
00:09:59,019 --> 00:10:01,869
even tell you how good it feels to be

335
00:10:00,189 --> 00:10:03,160
able to open a morphe palette and use a

336
00:10:01,869 --> 00:10:04,899
mirror inside of it to blend my

337
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,429
eyeshadow today just because I've

338
00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:07,929
modeled before this collection does not

339
00:10:06,429 --> 00:10:09,790
mean I can't throw a little bit of shade

340
00:10:07,929 --> 00:10:12,279
at my favorite brand this should have

341
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:13,899
been done a lot sooner and I'm so glad

342
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:15,249
they finally did it once that's all

343
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:16,809
blended out and I'm happy with where the

344
00:10:15,249 --> 00:10:18,399
green is I'm gonna go to the other side

345
00:10:16,809 --> 00:10:21,999
of that flat Packer brush and dip into

346
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:24,309
the shade so glam it is like this bronzy

347
00:10:21,999 --> 00:10:25,929
antique greeny gold type of color it is

348
00:10:24,309 --> 00:10:27,309
so beautiful and I'll grab a little bit

349
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:28,809
of my morphe setting spray and I'm going

350
00:10:27,309 --> 00:10:30,759
to spritz the brush just to get it nice

351
00:10:28,809 --> 00:10:32,499
and damp so the color is super pigmented

352
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:38,139
and then I'm just gonna pack this right

353
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:42,279
on the center of the lid that's

354
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:43,540
beautiful I'm next I take the pencil

355
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:46,089
brush on the ice like it and I'm gonna

356
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:47,620
dip into the shade pine and I'm going to

357
00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:49,480
use this to blend out the edges and

358
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:51,370
deepen up the inner and outer corner of

359
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,420
this halo eye this pie and show you

360
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:53,679
deftly does have a little bit of kick

361
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:55,209
back so make sure to top off your brush

362
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:57,069
before you apply it or else you might be

363
00:10:55,209 --> 00:10:58,449
looking a little crazy and then just for

364
00:10:57,069 --> 00:11:00,579
a little bit more vibrancy I'm gonna dip

365
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:02,800
into the shade muse which is a block for

366
00:11:00,579 --> 00:11:04,329
the palate once again so glad we're

367
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,009
finally adding blocks with our palettes

368
00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:07,389
I always love a little bit of block to

369
00:11:06,009 --> 00:11:09,579
define and just be everything a little

370
00:11:07,389 --> 00:11:10,809
bit more deep and then back into that

371
00:11:09,579 --> 00:11:13,620
original fluffy brush that we use for

372
00:11:10,809 --> 00:11:13,620
the transition shade

373
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,750
for one final pop on the island before

374
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,129
we move on to the lower lash line I want

375
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:25,529
to show you guys saying that I am so

376
00:11:23,129 --> 00:11:27,870
excited about and that is the master of

377
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:29,579
metallic sad so these are here are the

378
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:31,529
master of metallics and these are cream

379
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:32,730
eyeshadows and these are probably my

380
00:11:31,529 --> 00:11:34,500
favorite item out of this entire

381
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:36,750
collection aside from the 39a palette of

382
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,819
course this set of three cream

383
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:40,470
eyeshadows comes for $12 meaning there

384
00:11:38,819 --> 00:11:42,480
are four dollars each and these are so

385
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:49,139
beyond beautiful so comes with the shade

386
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:50,490
gold bronze and copper oh my god and my

387
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:51,990
opinion they're pretty comparable to the

388
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:53,370
steel at liquid metals they're

389
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:54,480
definitely not as like a glittery but

390
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:56,730
they're really really beautiful and

391
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,740
metallic and shiny and this is the only

392
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:01,319
$12 for a set of three meaning there are

393
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:02,699
four dollars each you guys you have to

394
00:12:01,319 --> 00:12:03,689
get these that I really really hope that

395
00:12:02,699 --> 00:12:05,129
more he comes out with more of these

396
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:07,139
soon because I definitely will be

397
00:12:05,129 --> 00:12:08,040
needing a lot more colors for today's

398
00:12:07,139 --> 00:12:09,389
I'm going to take a little bit of the

399
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,519
shade of gold and pop that right on the

400
00:12:09,389 --> 00:12:13,470
center of my lid oh my god that is so

401
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,730
pretty then before choice that I'm just

402
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:17,279
gonna take my pencil brush to make sure

403
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:18,449
the edges are nice and blended out so

404
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,610
lesson learned these definitely dry down

405
00:12:18,449 --> 00:12:22,019
really really fast which is definitely

406
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:23,550
not a bad thing but if you're gonna be

407
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:25,829
playing with these just be careful work

408
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:28,319
in small sections and blend fast because

409
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:33,300
this looks so bomb by the way speaking

410
00:12:28,319 --> 00:12:33,809
of fast dry down times as well you're

411
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,339
kidding

412
00:12:33,809 --> 00:12:36,750
so now that the top foot is all done

413
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:37,920
let's go in with the lower lash line and

414
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,449
the first thing I got that fluffy brush

415
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,250
once again from the ice light collection

416
00:12:39,449 --> 00:12:42,899
and dip into the shade it defined me

417
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:45,600
just for a light wash the color for the

418
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:47,129
smooth blend on the lower lash and then

419
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,629
using an Adam 514 with a shade of

420
00:12:47,129 --> 00:12:51,269
passion and deepening that up a little

421
00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:53,009
bit and then placing the shade a fickle

422
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:54,930
on the inner and outer corner using that

423
00:12:53,009 --> 00:12:56,730
pencil brush once you're gonna give me a

424
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:58,559
little bit of muse on a tiny liner brush

425
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:00,329
and I'm going to place that right on the

426
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:02,670
inner and outer corners just for a

427
00:13:00,329 --> 00:13:03,930
little bit more definition and then just

428
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:09,389
putting a little dollop of the gold

429
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:10,470
cream shadow right in the center so next

430
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:11,550
we have two more kits from this

431
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:13,920
collection both beating to draw

432
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:15,689
attention sets they come in neutral and

433
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,120
bold and these are both sets of 10

434
00:13:15,689 --> 00:13:19,920
different eyeliner pencils it has $19

435
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,569
each for 10 pencils per kit and this is

436
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,189
what they look like and for today's line

437
00:13:21,569 --> 00:13:24,959

438
00:13:23,189 --> 00:13:26,339

up my lower waterline for last day I'm

441
00:13:28,439 --> 00:13:39,550
gonna quickly pop on a pair of house

442
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:41,589
Lasha psychotics once again thank God

443
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:44,560
for this mirror situation it is

444
00:13:41,589 --> 00:13:46,329
literally a holiday miracle alright guys

445
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,500
and that is one holiday I'll complete

446
00:13:46,329 --> 00:13:49,209
I'm gonna do the other one off camera

447
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,380
quickly to save some time and I'll be

448
00:13:49,209 --> 00:13:52,300

00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:00,490
highlight off cameras we get that

453
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:02,320
natural glow and now to move on to the

454
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:03,310

455
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,899
ton of lips launched with this

456
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:07,180

different lips inside so $4 a liquid

461
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:18,970
lipstick so in the paint the town notes

462
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:20,860
that we have this shade Lulu

463
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:23,410
sweets which is the lightest of the

464
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:25,089
three and then dainty and then in the

465
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:27,519
paint the town red set we have the shade

466
00:14:25,089 --> 00:14:30,010
of stunner which is a deep blue toned

467
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:32,050
rabbit Bonnie which is a true like

468
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:34,420
bright red perfect for the holiday

469
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:36,459
season and then finally the shade lovely

470
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:38,019
which is a more orange e tone red they

471
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:39,550
also launched five different metallic

472
00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:40,990
liquid lipstick shades that all retail

473
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:42,550
for $12 each

474
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:43,870
just being straight-up honest metallic

475
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:45,220
low hood lipsticks are really not my

476
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:46,660
favorite I'm not the biggest fan of the

477
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,220
look of them but I'm gonna show you guys

478
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:51,040
anyway just in case you are because

479
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:53,470
that's 45 we had this like red metallic

480
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,839
shade which is called spotlight there's

481
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:57,910
also this bronzy shade called luster

482
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,649
this beautiful bright gold shade is

483
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:01,329
called Goldy this shade called

484
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:04,120
reflection is the very like muted

485
00:15:01,329 --> 00:15:05,769
purpley Mavi color but on camera it's

486
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,760
showing up really really vibrant which

487
00:15:05,769 --> 00:15:08,290
leads me to believe that this may be

488
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:10,089
more of like a duo chrome shade other

489
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:11,740
than a metallic which is super dope and

490
00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:13,480
then we have the shade sleek which is

491
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:15,430
once again a more a red metallic shade

492
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,810
and this is it next to spotlight as you

493
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:18,790
can see it's a little more purpley and a

494
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:20,230
little bit deeper for lips today I'm

495
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:23,829
first gonna apply this shade of Lulu all

496
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:26,459
over and then layering over top the

497
00:15:23,829 --> 00:15:26,459
shade of sweets

498
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,350
and then lhasa finally not least I'm

499
00:15:34,239 --> 00:15:40,660
gonna finish off this look you see my

500
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:42,399
morphe setting spray I reckon this is

501
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:44,259
the completed look using the brand new

502
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,300
morphe Holiday Collection I'm honestly

503
00:15:44,259 --> 00:15:49,089
living for this like I said it has been

504
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:50,709
so so long so I put on a green eyeshadow

505
00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:53,649
because I just really not my favorite

506
00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:55,420
color but today I'm like living the camo

507
00:15:53,649 --> 00:15:56,920
fantasy definitely comment down below

508
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:59,110
tell me what you guys think of the brand

509
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:00,819
new collection do you like it - love it

510
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:02,799
do you hate it I can't wait to see what

511
00:16:00,819 --> 00:16:04,239
all your sisters have to say like I said

512
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:05,769
it was such an honor to be working with

513
00:16:04,239 --> 00:16:07,480
morphe on this collection just to make

514
00:16:05,769 --> 00:16:09,970
everything very very very clear this is

515
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:11,350
not a collaboration this is not a James

516
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:13,329
Charles X morphe palette

517
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:14,589
although saying that does sound really

518
00:16:13,329 --> 00:16:16,809
really nice and that would definitely be

519
00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:18,339
something amazing for the future but

520
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,899
this is just a normal palette I just

521
00:16:18,339 --> 00:16:21,730
happened to be the model for it I'm not

522
00:16:19,899 --> 00:16:23,410
making any money off of this as always

523
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:25,389
