00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,799

00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:06,330

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,440
so beyond excited for today's a

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,389
brand-new video I just want to jump

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,340
right into it today's video has been

6
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:13,799
literally the most highly requested

7
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,210
video probably ever from you guys and

8
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:16,109
something that I've wanted to do for a

9
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,850
very long time as well

10
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:19,980
ever since I announced the palette and

11
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,439
that is well it's gonna be the fastest

12
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:25,529
intro ever full face of makeup using

13
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,539
only my palette if you sisters know me

14
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:29,340
you would know that I love a good at

15
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:30,869
competition that I never ever backed

16
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,759
down from a challenge I always go above

17
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:35,070
and beyond sand I really really do not

18
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,870
like losing so not even gonna lie when I

19
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,399
first read this comment I was a little

20
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,260
bit nervous about doing this challenge

21
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,550
but after kind of looking at the full

22
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,680
palette and planning everything out in

23
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,450
my head I do think that I actually will

24
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,950
be able to slay this challenge of course

25
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:48,360
there will be a few complications along

26
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,129
the way when it comes like a foundation

27
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,350
and other things like that but we're

28
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:53,940
gonna get through them together all that

29
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,129
being said I am so excited to dive in

30
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,840
and so without further ado let's unleash

31
00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:01,300
our inner artist and do a full face of

32
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:06,409
makeup using only my palette

33
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:08,460
[Music]

34
00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:09,990
all right you guys so to make sure that

35
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,190
I sisters slay this challenge today I

36
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,780
think I'm gonna go in the same order

37
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:14,310
it's my normal makeup routine and just

38
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,750
replace each step along the way so I

39
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,430
don't miss any and of course you guys

40
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:20,400
know at first I always do my foundation

41
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:22,020
to lay down a light base now looking at

42
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,910
this palette we have already run into a

43
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,560
little bit of an issue now you and I are

44
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:27,119
sisters so must be honest with each

45
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,920
other we all know that I'm not exactly

46
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,330
the best when it comes to matching my

47
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,130
foundation there's no need to talk about

48
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:33,300
it thanks so if I was to use one of the

49
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:37,619
change in the palette my options are

50
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:40,140
either bright white bright yellow orange

51
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:42,060
which happens a lot regardless and super

52
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,430
super pale none of which really seemed

53
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,020
to be viable options so I posted a poll

54
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,759
on my Instagram story and I asked you

55
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,500
guys I said should I start off on my

56
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,119
base already on camera and just do every

57
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,369
other step after using only the pounds

58
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,820
or should I not cheat and literally just

59
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:59,820
scam foundation and I literally a two

60
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:03,270
percent vote don't she know Foundation

61
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:05,009
won with 51% so I guess we're doing a no

62
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,569
foundation makeup look today I'm not

63
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:08,700
exactly sure how that is gonna work out

64
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:11,009
I am having a pretty good skin day today

65
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:12,930
thank God but I am definitely very red

66
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:14,360
so hopefully this like it calms down

67
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,740
during the process of the video

68
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,239
regardless I guess we're gonna move on

69
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,590
to the next step already okay so after

70
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,270
foundation we have concealer which I

71
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,830
cannot do and then after a concealer we

72
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,910
have powder which I can do but there's

73
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,720
no point if I'm not actually setting

74
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,489
anything in please

75
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,890
so after powder I guess were already on

76
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:29,940
to contouring so we definitely have a

77
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,410
lot of options when it comes to a

78
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,180
bronzing but that is going to be at the

79
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:35,489
next step so to contour I'm gonna get

80
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,920
Miami 405 brush this is that my brush

81
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:40,080
set and dip into the shade I think hunch

82
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,489
me might be a pretty good at contouring

83
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,940
color it is one of the only cool tone

84
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:45,900
Browns

85
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:48,629
in the palette so let's try that kind of

86
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:51,810
good okay a little more just a slight

87
00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:52,980
chisel okay down down for this I think I

88
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,330
want to keep it pretty light when it

89
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,770
comes to the face makeup just because a

90
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:57,300
lot of contour and blush and highlight

91
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:59,099
might look a little bit strange over top

92
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,050
of my normal skin when there's no base

93
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:02,280
underneath to even everything out oh my

94
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,730
god you guys my face actually might

95
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,099
match my

96
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:06,930
for once okay this is already not

97
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:09,150
looking the best because at this shade

98
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:10,860
is very very cool tone but my face is

99
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:13,129
very very red and they were kind of

100
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:17,849
mending together to already make orange

101
00:03:13,129 --> 00:03:19,319
don't even want a bronze oh maybe we'll

102
00:03:17,849 --> 00:03:21,000
just go light lastly before I go to the

103
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:22,349
bronze I'm just gonna grab the e at 62

104
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,940
this does come with my bracelet and it's

105
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:25,950
the custom brush that I made and I use

106
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,390
this one for and nose contouring I'm

107
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:29,010
just gonna grab a little bit more punch

108
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:30,060
me and just go right down the side of

109
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:33,150
the bridge

110
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,290
oh god that does not look good I guess

111
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,430
the good thing about a hobby foundation

112
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,390
was that I can literally just drop it

113
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:39,870
off if it looks stupid

114
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:41,849
what are those oh it's my glasses marks

115
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:43,739
you're literally kidding me people who

116
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:45,540
wear glasses to truly know the struggle

117
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:47,310
like these red marks are permanently

118
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,480
embedded into my skin forever and I've

119
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:51,810
been wearing these contacts all day long

120
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,890
like how rude that looks not good it's

121
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:54,629
okay we're gonna make it work so bronze

122
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:57,510
gonna grab me five to seven brush that

123
00:03:54,629 --> 00:04:00,510
dip into the shade code James now this

124
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:03,329
shade is very very pigmented so what

125
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:10,440
we're not going to do is make me look

126
00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:11,639
orange Oh too late okay oh my god you

127
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:14,040
guys really got me covered this whole no

128
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:15,780
foundation thing Jesus maybe if I just

129
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,209
like really blended out it won't be oh

130
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:20,789
that's bad oh my god no it is good about

131
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:24,000
this though washed out I'm gonna grab my

132
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:26,849
makeup plate if I go like this all nice

133
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,229
and chiseled doesn't look good for blush

134
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:29,970
I'm gonna grab my efore brush and dip

135
00:04:28,229 --> 00:04:32,700
into the shade literally which is this

136
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:34,050
metallic pinky peach shade this is what

137
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,430
my all-time favorite shades in the

138
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:37,020
palette and I feel like this one is

139
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:39,000
getting overlooked a little bit at some

140
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:41,039
of the reviews that I'm seeing so I want

141
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,479
to show her some love the shade is so

142
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:44,130
what beyond beautiful and I added it to

143
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,289
the palette to be a perfect kind of

144
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:49,169
blush shade to mix together your bronzer

145
00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:52,289
and your highlighter it is like oh my

146
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:54,300
how obsessed she's looking up a little

147
00:04:52,289 --> 00:04:56,880
of time I think I'm gonna lay down like

148
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:58,919
a light coat of highlighter to just to

149
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,870
kind of get the face going so I make my

150
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:02,310
face a quick spritz of the crepiness at

151
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,140
settings prior they were saying

152
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:05,760
literally and the entire world you guys

153
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:08,490
need this in your lives and I'm gonna

154
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:11,460
grab the shade face on Miami 501 this

155
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:13,500
comes in the brush that a little bit

156
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:15,360
above the brow bone as always love a

157
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,230
good glow here like can you imagine what

158
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,940
it would be like to actually have like

159
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:21,270
good even skin and to be able to do this

160
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:23,010
and it looked like not disgusting then a

161
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:26,070
little bit right down the tip of the

162
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:27,180
nose as well this pilot or is really

163
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:30,120
intense when you don't have the base

164
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:31,380
underneath it oh my god I'm gonna come

165
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,610
back to the base later on and see if

166
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:36,600
there's anything that we can do to kind

167
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:38,040
of fix it so next time is going to be

168
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,450
the brows and I'm already a little bit

169
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,790
concerned about this step I'm not even

170
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:43,410
going to lie my Anasazi umbrellas is my

171
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:45,000
favorite pencil in the entire world and

172
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:46,200
whenever I get Austin interviews if you

173
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,340
could bring three big upon us that are

174
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,900
deserted island what would they be in

175
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:51,090
that it's always the first one that I

176
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:53,070
say because I literally had quite the

177
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:54,900
broad transformation and using any other

178
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:56,880
products triggers me including brow

179
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:59,790
powders which I absolutely hate so an

180
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,710
eye shadow is really not any different

181
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:03,420
for the brows I'm gonna grab my m15

182
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:06,210
eight brush this also comes in the brush

183
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:08,640
set and dip into the shade T in the top

184
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:11,250
right hand corner this is a cold tone

185
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:13,320
dark brown shade and I'm going to fill

186
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:16,260
the brows go start ways to catching the

187
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:17,970
tail and then drawing the bottom line

188
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:19,320
I'm trying to keep it very very light

189
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:21,390
hand because I definitely do not have a

190
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,890
lot of cool tone Brown options in the

191
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:24,600
palette and I want to be able to like

192
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:26,700
actually layer it up and add dimension

193
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,260
so I don't have Sharpie brows so to do

194
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:30,960
that I think I pretty much only want to

195
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:32,850
define the tail this is actually a

196
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,260
pretty good color for my brows just

197
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,580
gonna use the end of that brush to kind

198
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,590
of blend anything in the front of the

199
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:39,780
brow okay come on that's not that bad

200
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:41,400
I'm gonna try it on the other brow as

201
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:43,020
well so are you guys I'm literally being

202
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,430
so quiet I just know that I don't really

203
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,590
have many options when it comes to

204
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:48,990
making this look good so I'm trying to

205
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:50,820
actually focus clearly makeup has no

206
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:52,290
rules but this is why I will never

207
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,700
understand how people do their eyebrows

208
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:57,690
at first before anything else because

209
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:59,220
this books literally crazy Oh ready to

210
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:00,780
move on so moving on we have the next

211
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,310
step which is going to be of course the

212
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,660
eye shadow which is my favorite part of

213
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:05,490
the entire routine or we get to use the

214
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:07,020
palette for what it's actually intended

215
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:08,430
for it to look really good and fresh

216
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,650
I decided not to cheat and do no

217
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:12,240
foundation in honor of you guys but when

218
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:13,770
it comes to this I am going to cheat and

219
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,720
I am going to use just a little bit of

220
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:17,190
an eyeshadow base this one is the P

221
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,080
Louise basis is literally one of the

222
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:20,009
best bases in the entire world I learned

223
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,479
about this product from a lot of my

224
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:23,759
favorite international artists such as a

225
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:26,039
mum of Mitchell and say Siri MUA and

226
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,690
Kaleigh they're also incredibly tells it

227
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:29,069
and it works really well for all them I

228
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,940
have had nothing but amazing results

229
00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:31,289
with this as well

230
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,069
and I know a lot of you guys we're

231
00:07:31,289 --> 00:07:34,020
concerned about the fact that I

232
00:07:32,069 --> 00:07:35,639
recommended an eye primer or like a Mac

233
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,930
Paint Pot this product right here is a

234
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:38,460
super super great alternative as well

235
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:40,319
gonna use a little bit of this to clean

236
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:42,030
up the eyebrow using the Amba 410 brush

237
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,830
this one it does come in at my breast

238
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:45,120
and then with one of the flat concealer

239
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,800
brushes from the brush set this is the

240
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,240
m22 for I'm just gonna grab a little bit

241
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,400
more of that from the back of my hand

242
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,319
and I'm going to tap on any excess and

243
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,569
use this it would just little patting

244
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,830
motions all across the eyelid just to

245
00:07:54,569 --> 00:07:57,210
lay down a light base with a look that

246
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:58,530
I'm going to do so since we're keeping

247
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,000
it pretty neutral on the shades that

248
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:02,069
we're using when it comes to my face

249
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,479
clearly I do want to go in and play with

250
00:08:02,069 --> 00:08:05,190
a few different colors when it comes to

251
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:07,349
the Oxbow my shadow why not let's

252
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:09,690
unleash my inner artist together I think

253
00:08:07,349 --> 00:08:13,409
I want to do like a sunset smokey eye no

254
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:14,909
with a blue and purple on the lid mmm

255
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:16,409
yeah guys we're just gonna do that I'd

256
00:08:14,909 --> 00:08:17,430
hope they don't look alright so just go

257
00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:19,139
ahead and zoom do you guys get a little

258
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,430
bit more so we can focus on the eye look

259
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:22,440
together and make sure we get all the

260
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:24,240
details I'm first gonna go to Miami 4 or

261
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:26,940
5 6 brush and dip into a little bit of a

262
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,969
mix of the shades and cola and escape

263
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:31,830
and just pack this literally right on

264
00:08:29,969 --> 00:08:34,110
that outer B I'm not gonna put too much

265
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:35,430
on here because I have a lot of colors

266
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:37,620
that I need to fit in this eye look

267
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:39,149
today and the last thing that I want is

268
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,770
for it to get really really messy

269
00:08:39,149 --> 00:08:42,419
and that's better take another M 4 5 6

270
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:45,209
brush and dip into the shade it's single

271
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:47,040
which is the bright purple and I'm going

272
00:08:45,209 --> 00:08:49,020
to use this shade to diffuse out that

273
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,120
edge making sure to keep this once again

274
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:52,680
at very very low to the eyelid because

275
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,209
we have a lot of colors I'm basically

276
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,980
laying this purple right over top of

277
00:08:54,209 --> 00:08:57,750
those two dark shades just to how to

278
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,220
diffuse the edges going back into the

279
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,630
other brush and just adding in some of

280
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,370
the darkness again next we're gonna have

281
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:04,230
4 3 3 to continue this sunset I'm gonna

282
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:06,010
grab the shade you're kidding

283
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:07,660
literally my favorite red in the entire

284
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:10,030
world and I'm just going to buff out

285
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,960
once again that line I'm trying to go in

286
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:12,880
with a little bit of a light hand

287
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,380
because this red is insanely pigmented

288
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,180
and I still have a few more colors that

289
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:18,190
I need to add overtop of it so I don't

290
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,900
want it to get too high up just once

291
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:21,070
again using those stamping and patting

292
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:23,350
motions to get the pigment on there

293
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:25,300
first and then just lightly going over

294
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:26,350
to blend it out going back in with a

295
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:28,630
single to make sure we don't lose that

296
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:30,460
purple in that blend next better gonna

297
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:32,350
be another M four five six and dip into

298
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:34,390
the shade and five one eight and this is

299
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:36,760
the bright neon orange and I'm going to

300
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:38,710
diffuse out the red and I'm definitely

301
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,480
taking my sweet time especially since we

302
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:43,120
were getting close to it the eyebrow I

303
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,710
do not want all the colors to get muddy

304
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,540
and then finally just a little bit more

305
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:49,240
of single lastly I'm gonna go a little

306
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:51,670
bit of beyond an M of 514 brush and just

307
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,380
use this to buff out that final orange

308
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:56,050
edge so now that the eye situation is

309
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:58,150
finally figured out oh my god not

310
00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:00,250
wearing foundation literally not the

311
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:02,590
move I think I want to do a pop of blue

312
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:03,910
on the actual eyelid so oh I shouldn't

313
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:05,710
be cut the crease first I'm first gonna

314
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:07,480
dip into the shade acappella Miami one

315
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:09,130
to four and give it a quick spread of my

316
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:12,550
a setting spray and I'm going to first

317
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:14,530
pop this right on it the outer area of

318
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:16,930
the lid just kind of patting and

319
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:19,240
wiggling that shade right on there I'm

320
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:21,280
gonna put in probably about two halfway

321
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,530
on the lid as well and bringing that

322
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:25,060
right up to that crease line and then

323
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:27,400
with whatever's left I'm gonna go in and

324
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:29,500
lightly wiggle that brush and between

325
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,570
the transition area just to kind of get

326
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:33,010
these two to blend together I'm gonna go

327
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:34,750
back with my original brush that I use

328
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:37,390
literally first and a little bit of Cola

329
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:38,950
just to Pat over that transition just

330
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:40,090
make sure it's nice and smooth and then

331
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:42,130
without same brush I'm gonna dip into

332
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:44,500
the shade how low which is the right

333
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:45,670
metallic teal shade a little bit more of

334
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,040
the settings right and I'm gonna tuck

335
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:49,990
this shade on the inner half of the

336
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,790
eyelid event of lemon together I'm just

337
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:54,520
gonna start topping over at that border

338
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:56,110
with whatever is left of Hello Lassa

339
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,640
finally not least because why not i was

340
00:10:56,110 --> 00:11:00,460
gonna dip into a little bit of artistry

341
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:02,980
on my finger and i'm just gonna top this

342
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:04,180
right over top of my lid for the laurel

343
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:06,250
are the way to show off a little bit of

344
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:07,840
you're kidding just right up against the

345
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,170
lash and then just a little bit of beet

346
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,209
to blend that right out

347
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:12,320
the little Cuban e15 to browse just who

348
00:11:11,209 --> 00:11:14,300
these come with a brush set I'm gonna

349
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,149
grab a tiny little bit of ASCII and use

350
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:18,860
this finally last but not least just to

351
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:20,389
tuck this right up against that lash

352
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:22,279
line up for a little bit of dimension

353
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:23,990
and to connect it in it to that outer

354
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:25,190
little wing that we created to complete

355
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:27,290
this eye look I'm just gonna grab it why

356
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:29,660
not last pencil brush and dab into the

357
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:31,910
shade of B and I'm gonna place this kind

358
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:34,339
of really heavily into the inner corner

359
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:36,019
and then with a tiny little detail brush

360
00:11:34,339 --> 00:11:37,430
this one is not even in the brush spot I

361
00:11:36,019 --> 00:11:39,230
don't know where I even found this I'm

362
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:41,870
gonna dip into a mix of the shade and

363
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:44,570
ringly and so good give it a quick

364
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:48,079
little spritz and I'm going to tuck this

365
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:50,089
shade right on top of that yellow loving

366
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,260
my shadows are too pigmented it's gonna

367
00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:54,019
grab a little bit of B and go right over

368
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:55,130
that just to kind of dull it down a

369
00:11:54,019 --> 00:11:56,360
little bit never thought I would say

370
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:58,040
that when it comes to the inner corner

371
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,480
highly gonna use that same exact mixture

372
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:02,779
and pop a little bit onto the brow bone

373
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:05,750
and I think finally that is what I all

374
00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:08,120
complete oh my god you guys I don't know

375
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:09,980
why it that took me so long I still

376
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,300
struggle with sunset smokey eyes every

377
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,730
single time I do them I generally just

378
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:16,399
don't understand how some people can fit

379
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:17,930
so many colors in such a short amount of

380
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,579
space like literally this tiny little

381
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:21,170
space has to have eyebrow highlight and

382
00:12:19,579 --> 00:12:22,820
yellow and orange and red and magenta

383
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:24,920
and purple and dark apart wall

384
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:27,380
look how how do you do that I don't know

385
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:30,620
clearly but this is looking like okay is

386
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:33,529
it my best no is it my worst definitely

387
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:35,300
not so in that case I am happy and ready

388
00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:36,680
to move on to the other eye which I'm

389
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,850
now going to do off camera so you guys

390
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:40,399
don't have to stay here and watch me for

391
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:41,990
another two hours be right back all

392
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,149
right hello I am back and those are both

393
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:46,790
eyes all done and complete and now I am

394
00:12:44,149 --> 00:12:48,320
definitely ready to move on there really

395
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:51,199
isn't a whole lot left of this look that

396
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,600
I'm able to do with the palette but

397
00:12:51,199 --> 00:12:54,920
we're going to try so I think the one

398
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,680
thing that I really want to address is

399
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:59,360
my splotchy skin as I put more add more

400
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,220
and more makeup on to my actual eyes it

401
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,079
became very apparent that I was not

402
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:04,819
wearing any base makeup like I said I am

403
00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:07,100
very much not used to this I wish I had

404
00:13:04,819 --> 00:13:08,389
even skin because this look is so beyond

405
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:10,100
beautiful and I wish that I could rock

406
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:11,990
this and feel confident while doing

407
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,820
but I really just don't so I do want to

408
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:15,290
do a little bit of like covering if I

409
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,550
possibly Canada what I'm gonna do is

410
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:18,560
grab a beauty blender that I went in the

411
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:19,940
sink but completely wrung out like there

412
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,680
is a little easier moisture in this and

413
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:24,080
different to the shade in canvas it is

414
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,540
like the pale kind of eyelid a setting

415
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:30,790
shade and I'm gonna put this on here and

416
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:30,790
see if this does a neat good job Oh

417
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:37,280
we'll be doing a lot of fast oh my god

418
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:41,510
here we go

419
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:42,710
Oh oh my god I literally should have

420
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:44,480
covered my entire face with this I

421
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:45,920
cannot believe that I did not try this

422
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,630
out earlier I think that I probably

423
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,060
assumed that canvas was too light for my

424
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:51,170
skin tone but clearly it is not and of

425
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,760
course we can always address it with

426
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:54,380
bronzer I don't know where my mind was

427
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,610
doing this I really should've thought of

428
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:57,560
this as well because I've been watching

429
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:58,940
a few reviews and what was so cold

430
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,830
how did I actually saw a few different

431
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:02,780
girls using the kind of tube which is

432
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:04,250
the kind of peachy banana shade as an

433
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:06,560
under eye setting powder for darker skin

434
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:07,760
tones so genius it is literally so cool

435
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,680
watching so many different people test

436
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,510
out different techniques so if you are

437
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,730
of a similar skin tone to me and you

438
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:15,400
happen to be doing the full face using

439
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:17,780
only one eyeshadow palette challenge

440
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:19,760
canvas is a great foundation color I

441
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:21,500
think just for funsies I want to add

442
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,000
some fake freckles so this look one

443
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,530
because they're really really cute and

444
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,020
two because they're gonna distract from

445
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:28,730
my other skin that's going on so I'm

446
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:33,080
gonna grab a tiny little lighter brush

447
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:36,400
this is the e30 7 and in two teeth does

448
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:38,780
they'd be a little bit dark let's see

449
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:40,550
not too well you know what maybe I'll do

450
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:42,650
a few of them entities like for the

451
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:45,350
darker ones let's see just placing on

452
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:46,580
little tiny dots everywhere to add a

453
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:48,200
little bit of like a sunburn effect I'm

454
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:50,210
gonna go over a little bit of a punch me

455
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,939
and dipping into the tiniest little bit

456
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:54,189
of 10% off and I'm just

457
00:14:51,939 --> 00:14:57,279
pop that right over top and it's kind of

458
00:14:54,189 --> 00:14:58,569
like okay so that is the face pretty

459
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,069
much all complete and I guess the last

460
00:14:58,569 --> 00:15:02,259
if at all staff is going to be at the

461
00:15:00,069 --> 00:15:05,319
lips which I'm not exactly sure how this

462
00:15:02,259 --> 00:15:07,479
is gonna work but we're gonna try I'm

463
00:15:05,319 --> 00:15:09,999
gonna grab an animal one two four brush

464
00:15:07,479 --> 00:15:12,519
once again and dip into the shade Mary

465
00:15:09,999 --> 00:15:17,439
which is probably like the best nude lip

466
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:20,589
shade in this palette and see how oh my

467
00:15:17,439 --> 00:15:23,019
god you're kidding I will say this is

468
00:15:20,589 --> 00:15:24,999
very hard to get a precise line this lip

469
00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:26,949
color is gross but it's a lip color

470
00:15:24,999 --> 00:15:29,229
maybe if I do okay I'm gonna put a

471
00:15:26,949 --> 00:15:30,699
little bit of flash back maybe in the

472
00:15:29,229 --> 00:15:32,049
middle kind of a flash like everywhere

473
00:15:30,699 --> 00:15:33,879
or rather this is little bit only

474
00:15:32,049 --> 00:15:36,279
working because my lips are so dry right

475
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:38,890
no maybe a little shimmer will make it

476
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:50,570
look kind of glossy

477
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:54,270
[Music]

478
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:56,460
is this full face using only my palette

479
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:57,840
all complete like I said in the

480
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:59,370
beginning of this video going into this

481
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,170
challenge today I was a little bit

482
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:02,580
nervous because you guys know I go

483
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:05,340
bigger go home and everything and I do

484
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:06,630
not like to lose but once actually kind

485
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:08,310
of examined the entire palette and

486
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:10,260
figured out what I wanted to do I was a

487
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:12,870
lot more confident and ready to go

488
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:14,370
that being said I am very very pleased

489
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:16,230
and proud of the finish result today I

490
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:17,790
think this looks so credibly beautiful

491
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:20,090
and it's honestly hard to tell that I

492
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:23,190
did this with no other products but

493
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:24,390
getting here was definitely not easy I

494
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,650
feel like I would have flown through

495
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:28,290
this challenge and not how to literally

496
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:30,690
any issue had I just done a campus all

497
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:32,100
over the face first I don't know why but

498
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:33,900
I just didn't think of it and my brain

499
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,400
literally cannot work on makeup

500
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,990
backwards I just have to have a base on

501
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,820
which is what I feel like really really

502
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:40,170
threw me off the contour finally and

503
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,970
blush could be a little bit better a

504
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:43,500
little bit sisters thought she but like

505
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:45,270
I said if I had a base on it probably

506
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:47,100
won't be having that issue same thing

507
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:48,830
with the eyebrows it didn't really have

508
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:51,330
anything to stick to so they look like

509
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:52,620
okay not the worst pearls definitely not

510
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:53,970
the best process I've ever done on a

511
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,740
Saskia sweetie I'm so sorry that I ever

512
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:57,780
tried you for this video as for the

513
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:59,730
actual eyeshadow I don't know why I was

514
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:01,530
sister struggling to do a sunset off cut

515
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:02,820
crease I do these types of looks all the

516
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:04,860
time but for some reason I just could

517
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:06,360
not blend its today that being said the

518
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:07,740
finish is all I think is so it'll be

519
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,270
beautiful I am in love with this eye

520
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,589
look and I think it highlights both the

521
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:12,390
blue shades and the warm tones on the

522
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:13,530
palette so incredibly beautifully I

523
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:14,699
definitely think that adding the frame

524
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:16,890
freckles were a really really great

525
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:18,810
touch I cannot believe that using a dark

526
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:20,339
brown shade like Tia literally worked

527
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:21,630
for this but I use it for any brain

528
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:23,010
lately and I definitely do think it

529
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:25,020
distracted from some of these splotchy

530
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:27,209
skin so really really glad I added that

531
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:29,610
and for the lips I cannot believe that

532
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:31,350
this even stock period definitely does

533
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:33,090
not look amazing would not walk out of

534
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:34,920
the house with these lips on but that

535
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:37,470
being said for literally begin I shadow

536
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:39,000
palette not bad

537
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:40,860
regardless of how this finished look

538
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,900
turned out though I had so much fun

539
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:44,430
doing this challenge oh my god you guys

540
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,200
know I love pushing myself so thank you

541
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,580
