[Music]

33
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:27,170
okay god I want to ask you a few

34
00:01:24,979 --> 00:01:28,880
questions about your job so the viewers

35
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:31,130
at home know about like how I grew up

36
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,399
with you and I was like what their job

37
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:39,680
entails so you are a contractor and

38
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:41,840
you're self-employed business and how

39
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,950
like to be a hard worker why do you work

40
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,750
for yourself why do you think I like

41
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:46,700
trickle down to people I like working

42
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:50,509
for myself because it you're gonna work

43
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:54,220
that hard and as as much as I do it's

44
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:54,220
far more beneficial for me

45
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:58,500
do you think because

46
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,480
that way and they cut yourself and

47
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,420
played still do you think that had a lot

48
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:07,140
to do with why you and mom or so lenient

49
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,970
let me do what I do was frightening to

50
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,250
be honest with you my mom and dad really

51
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,830
had no idea as to what when you were

52
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:17,190
doing it and more importantly how you

53
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,750
could actually turn it into a job but

54
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:23,150
you were always a hard worker but there

55
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:23,150
are always multi tasking you always say

56
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:34,819
all right you to do it little cribs

57
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:37,579
hopefully going to take this up I'm

58
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:46,939
