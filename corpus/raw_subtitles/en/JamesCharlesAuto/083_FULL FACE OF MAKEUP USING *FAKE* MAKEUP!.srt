00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:09,120
hi sister James Charles here welcome

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:10,530
back to my youtube channel as you guys

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,120
all know I just moved to downtown Los

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,820
Angeles and I officially it moved in

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,619
rudra definitely a coming soon but if

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,779
you're from the LA area you know there's

7
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:20,880
an iconic place a few blocks down called

8
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:22,710
Santee alley it's basically like the

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,560
hidden gem marketplace of Los Angeles

10
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:28,830
and as fabrics clothes makeup in all

11
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,869
types of glam and projects DIY crafty

12
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:33,000
types up but first super super low up

13
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:34,320
prices we're going to go tell us again I

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,969
went over to Santee alley with a few

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,200
friends to look for like clothing items

16
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:39,270
and jewelry but when I was there I

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,250
noticed that they had a ton of knockoff

18
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,660
makeup products I was doing products

19
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,289
from all my favorite brands like morphe

20
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,700
benefit Tariq Kat Von D Kylie but once I

21
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:50,070
got a closer look I realize that they

22
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,930
were all fake products so for today's

23
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,699
video I headed back over to Santee alley

24
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:55,920
to pick up a nostril all my finger

25
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:58,590
product and I'm going to be doing a full

26
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,090
phase of all fake makeup I have a ton of

27
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:03,449
stuff in front of me so without further

28
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:05,010
ado let's get started so first things

29
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:07,619
start off as always by priming my face

30
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:09,540
you might benefit Porefessional primer I

31
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:11,520
picked this up for a whopping three

32
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,320
dollars this is it in comparison to a

33
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,850
real professional it's one assessing a

34
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,830
little bit bigger and it looks a little

35
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,110
bit bluer as well but I because it's

36
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:24,030
extremely dirty I guess I'm gonna use

37
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:25,619
this at the primer whoa that dissolves

38
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:28,610
like my professional oh my god this

39
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:28,610
looks like foundation Oh

40
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:37,160
oh my for furnishing today I'm using the

41
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:41,750
mac studio fix fluid foundation in the

42
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:44,240
shade and c40 now if you already makeup

43
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:47,870
lover you will know that I am nowhere

44
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,640
near and NC 40 but this is the what came

45
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:52,580
out of the NZ 40 when I open the box

46
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,320
earlier today then it's not NZ for me

47
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:57,590
but this is the closest shade that I

48
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,570
could find to my skin tone serum try

49
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:01,490
this out to apply the makeup say I'm

50
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:03,950
using the out of Salvia for relief of

51
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:05,420
brushes very funny for one because these

52
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:07,220
do not actually exact so they're

53
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:09,380
literally a do both at non existent

54
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:11,630
products and to the brushes are upside

55
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:14,240
down inside the packaging great quality

56
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:17,840
content right here this literally will

57
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,350
not come out my parents to me when I was

58
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,570
12

59
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:24,080
oh actually it's not that bad of a shape

60
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:27,680
match and see for you my ass it's not

61
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:31,190
like really not doing its job books

62
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,540
forever okay this is just really not

63
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:34,310
doing the job to get on right so I'm

64
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:36,470
gonna switch over to my knockoff a

65
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:38,480
Beauty Blender this is what I got today

66
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:40,010
for a whopping three dollars and this is

67
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,870
in comparison to my regular Beauty

68
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:43,490
buzzer so obviously was a lot more pink

69
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,860
because it has foundations and stuff on

70
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:48,080
but they are pretty much like the same

71
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:50,120
size a whole lot fatter there's also a

72
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,670
lot more debt so I'm going to use this

73
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:55,160
try to focus on holton special attender

74
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:56,930
I know my mask on Dacians pretty well

75
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:59,720
and this one says is the studio fix

76
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:01,760
fluid is it definitely not very similar

77
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,739
to the students exclude the regular ones

78
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,760
a Mac is very very very high covered in

79
00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:09,350
a super super beautiful web skin then I

80
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,790
cannot say the same for so we definitely

81
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:12,200
still see like my redness popping

82
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:14,120
through especially over an early autumn

83
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,800
my nose where my glasses sit

84
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,290
there's a weird at pimple situation are

85
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,739
going on up in here my five o'clock

86
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:21,739
shadow

87
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:24,680
so then shave yet today definitely it

88
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:28,280
not be a regular max to be full coverage

89
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:30,440
but honestly it's not like awful pretty

90
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,910
bad could be worse we're going to learn

91
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,340
today we're using the Maybelline a

92
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:36,470
master conceal concealer in the shade

93
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,910
fair this is the only shade of the

94
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,050
concealer I can find something going to

95
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:39,490
be

96
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:41,350
a little bit light but the foundation is

97
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:45,030
definitely my machine either so

98
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:45,030
hopefully we can even things out

99
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:50,240
[Music]

100
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,770
also the firm you should definitely like

101
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:56,790
matched a few minutes ago and now it

102
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:59,170
already is oxidizing turning orange so

103
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:01,750
this is going to get even last my shade

104
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:03,790
by the end of today great for Mother's

105
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:06,160
tonight leaving the event i at luxury

106
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:08,260
and banana toner this was $15 which is

107
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:12,190
definitely a little pricey for a fake

108
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:14,020
setting color but oh well what something

109
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:15,550
really careful to not get this in at my

110
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,590
eyes because I have no idea what is in

111
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:19,690
this and I'm trying not to go even more

112
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,769
blind than I already am today first

113
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:22,990
thing I never thought about is this

114
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:25,270
powder is really really chunky and

115
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:27,730
splotchy it definitely does an awful on

116
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:29,350
a very smooth and I have tried to be a

117
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:31,030
regular Ben Nye banana powder people and

118
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:35,230
I've done a drive look it's really

119
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:36,940
really good definitely not it to further

120
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:39,670
highlight under my eyes I me a Mac

121
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:42,400
Studio Fix foundation plus powder in

122
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:44,800
this I have in the shade MC 30s once

123
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:48,790
again definitely not my shade and this

124
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:51,490
is what new powder it looks like oh I

125
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:53,500
forgot I bought this letter for $10 and

126
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:55,240
in comparison here is my regular Mac

127
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,400
Studio Fix information and this is in

128
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,380
the shade ad 3 so if you mind this is

129
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:02,530
really not that much later in this is n3

130
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:03,669
and this is MC 30 something really

131
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:11,410
doesn't add up there and I'll tell you

132
00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:15,220
it's 27 oh it smells like baby powder

133
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:17,650
like look like bad baby powder so it

134
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:20,169
sounds absolutely no coverage at all I

135
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:22,210
use my real one - usually a highlight

136
00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:23,440
insanities my eyes and in my forehead to

137
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:25,840
really brighten up my face and it has a

138
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,220
ton of coverage it always like to file

139
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,550
eyes except and covering on my under

140
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:30,940
eyes

141
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:32,199
this until you have done nothing because

142
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,460
it still looks like a sister needs to

143
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:35,710
get another 15 hours of sleep before

144
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:37,539
we're going to look like very de brazza

145
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:39,490
controi face today I'm using the Kat Von

146
00:05:37,539 --> 00:05:41,889
D shade and light palette you guys know

147
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:43,900
this is my Holy Grail contour now I have

148
00:05:41,889 --> 00:05:46,330
my real one right up in here so I'm

149
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:47,919
using the fake knock on phone today my

150
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:49,810
favorite part about this is that on the

151
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,099
back of the packaging they show you the

152
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:52,479
shades I don't know if the lighting is

153
00:05:51,099 --> 00:05:54,099
picking it up but literally this is like

154
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:57,789
shrug holiday and contouring colors

155
00:05:54,099 --> 00:05:59,110
these are all green so I'm four by to

156
00:05:57,789 --> 00:06:04,080
see what's gonna happen when we open at

157
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:06,970
the box what we got going on whoa oh

158
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,699
okay a little bit broken and I'm

159
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:11,530
currently a lot of it dirty so that's

160
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:13,389
great here's the comparison between it

161
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:14,889
be fake and it's a real one honestly

162
00:06:13,389 --> 00:06:16,900
they look pretty similar the only

163
00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:18,430
difference is that these colors are a

164
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,229
lot more warm tone and these on the

165
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:21,310
bottom or a lot more cool toned so the

166
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:22,690
quality this is going to be a whole lot

167
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:24,099
better and I was going to say it don't

168
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:25,719
judge what considering I just open up

169
00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:27,159
that open already shattered I don't

170
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:29,080
think this sister has a lot going for

171
00:06:27,159 --> 00:06:30,310
her wig I'm gonna grab this pointed

172
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,319
blending brush and use the middle shade

173
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:36,370
of the pallet insert to contour my face

174
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:39,340
I guess your honestly this is not that

175
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:40,960
the Oh light pink please stay back

176
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:43,539
notice it definitely does not blend out

177
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:46,090
it's easily as the normal shade of light

178
00:06:43,539 --> 00:06:47,440
does extend it a lot more patching and

179
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:53,979
it takes a little bit more to blend but

180
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:56,500
equipping a lot waters so it's not going

181
00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:58,569
to one so far one of my club drawers are

182
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,190
all in place again I'm going to use a

183
00:06:58,569 --> 00:07:03,990
little more of that by my luxury powder

184
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:08,940
I wear to a baked might be this is

185
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:08,940
extremely pigmented whoa

186
00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:16,209
while baking up medical notice our on my

187
00:07:13,659 --> 00:07:18,879
Brown and today we beat auto salvia this

188
00:07:16,209 --> 00:07:20,739
brow pomade it has been a long time

189
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:22,269
since I've used the real mafia Jeff

190
00:07:20,739 --> 00:07:23,769
Brown in general you guys know that I

191
00:07:22,269 --> 00:07:26,079
have made the official switch over to a

192
00:07:23,769 --> 00:07:26,949
brow pencil but this should be

193
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:28,659
interesting

194
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:30,639
here comes a tiny liner brush from the

195
00:07:28,659 --> 00:07:32,709
islands of the airbrush collection and

196
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,209
we're going to dip into ash brown which

197
00:07:32,709 --> 00:07:35,649
is definitely not my shade but it was

198
00:07:34,209 --> 00:07:38,109
literally the only shade there that most

199
00:07:35,649 --> 00:07:40,359
like you live remotely mastery's any way

200
00:07:38,109 --> 00:07:44,289
shape or form I'm going to try to you

201
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:50,139
with maybe the brows okay I already take

202
00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:52,899
this brush via texture up this is really

203
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:55,089
really like flat and annoyed I hate that

204
00:07:52,899 --> 00:07:56,589
word so much but like this is slipping

205
00:07:55,089 --> 00:07:57,939
around very very easily and I remember

206
00:07:56,589 --> 00:08:00,789
when I used to use dip route it was like

207
00:07:57,939 --> 00:08:02,499
really hard to kind of like mold and get

208
00:08:00,789 --> 00:08:04,719
into place but I like that because it

209
00:08:02,499 --> 00:08:06,939
was a lot harder to make you see simply

210
00:08:04,719 --> 00:08:07,569
with this whole lot easier I'm going to

211
00:08:06,939 --> 00:08:09,729
have a little bit more of that

212
00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:11,739
Maybelline master conceal in a flat top

213
00:08:09,729 --> 00:08:18,489
brush and I'm going to tie to clean up

214
00:08:11,739 --> 00:08:20,469
the brow a little bit we honestly

215
00:08:18,489 --> 00:08:22,509
cleaned up like this does not look that

216
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:24,129
bad it's like there's going to be a

217
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:27,369
trend throughout this video of me saying

218
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:28,899
oh it's not that bad which will reads me

219
00:08:27,369 --> 00:08:30,069
a little bit for the eye of today I'm

220
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:33,069
reading one of my all-time favorite

221
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:34,779
policy of morphia 35o palette of course

222
00:08:33,069 --> 00:08:36,370
this is not the real one

223
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:37,719
we got the sequin it's Angie for sixteen

224
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:39,550
dollars and this is a real one that we

225
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:41,620
chose for 22 and honestly they look

226
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:43,149
almost exactly identical but we're going

227
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:45,339
to put it onto the tendency probably

228
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:46,930
actually swatch and apply there off with

229
00:08:45,339 --> 00:08:49,240
this medium warm brown shade right here

230
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:58,209
and use it as a transition in my eyelid

231
00:08:49,240 --> 00:09:00,339
oh no whoa okay - kitchen that's not

232
00:08:58,209 --> 00:09:01,990
what I want I'm not finna grab an M

233
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:04,269
4-3-3 and I'm going to dip into this

234
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:07,089
dark brown shade down here and I'm going

235
00:09:04,269 --> 00:09:08,649
to darken up the outer crease okay for

236
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:11,290
some reason this I is like blending out

237
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:13,760
okay and this is just like watching a

238
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:18,440
patched central up in here

239
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:19,579
awful but this my like not bad I'm going

240
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,990
to have a clean blending brush and I'm

241
00:09:19,579 --> 00:09:23,000
going to go over the under sisters kind

242
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:24,380
of one so a little bit more than that

243
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,959
first shot it was a whole lot more

244
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:28,310
pigmented than I would anticipate but a

245
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,019
little better grab this shade right up

246
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:31,850
in here with AF flops up concealer brush

247
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:34,130
I'm going to apply that light on the

248
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:36,290
inner corner just run off with honestly

249
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:39,470
the maps were very very much impressing

250
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:41,149
me shimmer shade definitely is no

251
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:44,120
comparison to the real one - Morphy

252
00:09:41,149 --> 00:09:46,190
these are like ridiculously ridiculously

253
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,560
dry and I did what my brush a little bit

254
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:53,570
- I don't know how that actually worked

255
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:55,730
but they really not look good this is an

256
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:57,889
awful issue taking it way too long to be

257
00:09:55,730 --> 00:10:00,199
able to layer up a how to create that I

258
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:02,240
really should and that is the shadow all

259
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:04,190
done this my honestly looks pretty good

260
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,839
Vince I on the other hand definitely

261
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:07,399
needs a whole lot more work it just is

262
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,589
really not blending out so it was

263
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:11,180
sixteen dollars is not awful to master

264
00:10:09,589 --> 00:10:13,670
see fit the shimmer assembly are not

265
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:15,529
more equality honestly the way better

266
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:16,399
off to spending the extra eight dollars

267
00:10:15,529 --> 00:10:18,230
in getting the North through California

268
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,329
two dollars and of course you can do so

269
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:22,160
the chains as we all know for 10% off

270
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:23,510
your purchase well it's okay but I would

271
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,639
definitely say it find the extra money

272
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:27,649
get the real version for latter day I

273
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:31,069
picked up the Jade lashes in the style

274
00:10:27,649 --> 00:10:32,540
902 black they are the most similar

275
00:10:31,069 --> 00:10:34,490
luscious I could find to approach my

276
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:35,990
favorites because logic electronics so

277
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:38,300
I'm just going to a copy on tonight and

278
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:40,430
he's worth two dollars the last bed is

279
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,410
like super super or worked and it's like

280
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:44,269
going in all sorts of different

281
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:45,350
directions live with yourself whether or

282
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:48,620
not I'm going to be able to glue this on

283
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:50,149
it should be just saying I mean honestly

284
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:52,160
these are kind of pretty

285
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:54,440
I go to for you stuff like three of them

286
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,750
together they live me like a pair like

287
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,339
on it whatever I want a lot and we li la

288
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,870
girl floss liner I did buy this

289
00:10:58,339 --> 00:11:02,329
essentially if it's not really a

290
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:03,740
knockoff I was way too scared and it's

291
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:05,389
way too dangerous to use like a fake

292
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:07,399
product in your eye not going to mess

293
00:11:05,389 --> 00:11:09,230
around without today everybody Arabic

294
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:11,120
means my Holy Grail the benefit roller

295
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:13,370
lash once again not going to mess around

296
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,480
with that area that is both eyes often

297
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:16,639
see we're going to go ahead and move on

298
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,860
to the highlighter now for today so I'm

299
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:20,660
using the on apostate location gleam I

300
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:22,360
did used to have the areal version of

301
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:24,129
this but it was broken on airline

302
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:26,079
I'm not as far as folks you've never

303
00:11:24,129 --> 00:11:27,579
ever checked your makeup this is what

304
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,350
the house looks like at first glance

305
00:11:27,579 --> 00:11:30,970
there's our a and nail marks in the

306
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:33,040
starburst which is really strange

307
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:34,389
considering edges opening it's now how

308
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,980
leaders look like okay they don't look

309
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:37,389
bad in any way shape or form but I

310
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:39,220
definitely remember the original palette

311
00:11:37,389 --> 00:11:41,439
the hard candy and the crushed pearl

312
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:42,519
shades are a lot more pink so I guess

313
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:45,459
we're just going to put these on we're

314
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:48,730
going to see how they look it's not

315
00:11:45,459 --> 00:11:50,529
awful definitely is not like Nastasia

316
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:52,420
normal pigmentation up in here because

317
00:11:50,529 --> 00:11:53,139
you guys know that those little kids are

318
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:57,999
like Oh

319
00:11:53,139 --> 00:12:01,239
blinding it to the gods but I want to

320
00:11:57,999 --> 00:12:03,699
hate it when I can it smells like oh my

321
00:12:01,239 --> 00:12:06,069
go to some like a sneaker store that's

322
00:12:03,699 --> 00:12:07,959
what it smells like I feel like I'm like

323
00:12:06,069 --> 00:12:10,269
walking to the idols of adidas right now

324
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:14,049
oh my god I'm like scared to know is

325
00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:15,670
what kindness now now that the Holi is

326
00:12:14,049 --> 00:12:17,949
done similar to the eyes this probably

327
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:19,839
is not that bad but it's definitely not

328
00:12:17,949 --> 00:12:21,759
the same pay attention is quality as

329
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,739
original brand I would definitely

330
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:26,829
recommend this verging on the Logans but

331
00:12:23,739 --> 00:12:28,809
I guess it's doing the job for today

332
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:30,459
laughs it's certainly not leads to this

333
00:12:28,809 --> 00:12:32,290
video of course we had to do it lips and

334
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:34,089
what other brain has more feet than a

335
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:35,589
highly cosmetic

336
00:12:34,089 --> 00:12:36,910
ever since telling us begin their event

337
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:38,649
so many scales the people getting

338
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:40,419
pigmented of 6 and older Lisa from the

339
00:12:38,649 --> 00:12:42,759
cows describes an almost I love website

340
00:12:40,419 --> 00:12:44,819
so of course I had to pick up a fake

341
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:47,679
Kylie lip kit maybe picked up the shade

342
00:12:44,819 --> 00:12:48,850
exposed this put the lipstick was three

343
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:51,339
dollars so it's definitely beat the

344
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:53,110
price of Title 18 but let's do a little

345
00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:59,470
bit of tap and see how it compares

346
00:12:53,110 --> 00:13:01,889
oh my god that's very very pungent

347
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:04,809
we literally felt like paint this is

348
00:13:01,889 --> 00:13:07,480
where we'll put this on my lips putting

349
00:13:04,809 --> 00:13:11,019
it on I can like taste with smell of

350
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:13,499
paint the color is actually kind of

351
00:13:11,019 --> 00:13:13,499
ready to go

352
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:19,139
so basel syphilitic I do really really

353
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:20,850
like the color I don't have the kindly

354
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:23,430
actual lipstick in the shade exposed to

355
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:25,560
compare it to but in general the code is

356
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:27,120
actually really pretty over the white it

357
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,589
has been about two or three minutes that

358
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,630
actually applies to simplistic and it is

359
00:13:28,589 --> 00:13:32,940
still not fully dry down which is

360
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:34,440
definitely not a great thing I like

361
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:35,699
Kylie's lips tutorial because it does

362
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,800
write down a pretty fast and it is

363
00:13:35,699 --> 00:13:42,630
comfortable to wear this is getting dry

364
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:44,790
but as of like whole bit sicky never fun

365
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:46,889
because no one kid like these crusty

366
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:49,170
bits up in here and that is never going

367
00:13:46,889 --> 00:13:51,930
for a liquid lipstick where every

368
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:53,310
dollars done I don't pay that alright

369
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:55,290
guys and the crysta completed look that

370
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:57,269
I created using all knockoff makeup

371
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:59,399
product looking in the mirror I honestly

372
00:13:57,269 --> 00:14:00,810
do not look it's awful as expected

373
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:03,810
myself to it is definitely not the

374
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:05,639
classic James Charles Graham but it

375
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:07,500
could be a whole lot worse but Lee's

376
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:09,600
products were pretty comparable to the

377
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,010
originals but overall I definitely would

378
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,839
not be adding any of these to my

379
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:14,579
everyday and makeup routine this said

380
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:16,410
almost $150 and all these products

381
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:18,089
combined which is definitely not that

382
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:19,680
cheap considering all the stuff is fake

383
00:14:18,089 --> 00:14:21,480
and not the real thing

384
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,220
I definitely recommend spending a few

385
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,959
bucks extra to get the real product and

386
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,920
just get the full quality and making

387
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,470
sure that you're getting at the right

388
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,569
thing it's honestly super-agents video

389
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:32,399
and I did get pretty lucky my skin is

390
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:33,899
not reacting poorly I'm not going any

391
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,760
breakouts yet but I would definitely

392
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:37,199
keep you guys posted on my Twitter and

393
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,760
snapchat over the next few days

394
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,920
hopefully that something's destroyed my

395
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:42,449
skin often times fake makeup can contain

396
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,670
a lot of chemicals and gradients that

397
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:47,730
can really mess up your skin and your

398
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:49,470
immune system so I'm hoping that this

399
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:51,480
doesn't go with real self real stuff is

400
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:52,949
gonna fight like this on that being said

401
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:55,050
