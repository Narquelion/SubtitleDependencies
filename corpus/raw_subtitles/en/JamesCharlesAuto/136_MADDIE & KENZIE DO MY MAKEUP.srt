Persall Wow comes I'm sorry I'm sorry no

62
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:16,010
but like seriously were you that white

63
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:19,700
or it was a bad way say you don't know

64
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:21,410
this right either like everyone every

65
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:23,540
photo I look at I'm like there's no way

66
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:25,310
you were that way I wasn't that white I

67
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:27,260
was in Boston doing a meet-and-greet and

68
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:28,850
I took a picture with a bad her name was

69
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:32,480
Pam I myself are on Twitter today I can

70
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:34,190
say Pam and she was a far darker skin

71
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,170
that I was so when you take a photo with

72
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:37,460
contrasting skin tones automatically the

73
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:38,930
person with later skin tone is already

74
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,190
gonna look way lighter when you take it

75
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:41,210
with flash because of like the light

76
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,530
balancing on the camera I don't know

77
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:44,150
really how it works and then she always

78
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:45,920
puts a filter on her photos that make

79
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:48,020
them even brighter so I did look like

80
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,400
kind of gray in the photo and I

81
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,630
definitely did have flashback but the

82
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,190
picture that went viral people

83
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:54,950
completely desaturate it it made me

84
00:02:52,190 --> 00:03:00,170
white so I was not that way but I was

85
00:02:54,950 --> 00:03:03,470
definitely not looking at too hot it was

86
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:05,410
bad but not like that body right my side

87
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:09,260

88
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:10,850

well I just volunteered as tribute so

206
00:06:57,789 --> 00:07:06,219
we're Milo Hunger Games honey where you

207
00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:08,560
said babe Kenzie what are you doing I

208
00:07:06,219 --> 00:07:18,580
don't know what I'm doing whatsoever and

209
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:20,319
I'm we don't know it's not gender sister

210
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:23,860
it's funny cuz I can say it to you like

211
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,240
my sister there was a video of you it

212
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,520
says James Charles knowing Maddie

213
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,349
Ziegler for one minute straight and I

214
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,060
was like I don't know how they got that

215
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:32,500
because you did not annoy me one bit

216
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:34,750
yeah I'll just catch you I like the word

217
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:36,969
says the worst they really get you guys

218
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:38,889
I think they're funny but I think what

219
00:07:36,969 --> 00:07:40,479
sucks is that the comment section that

220
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:42,159
always gets horrible and then it turns

221
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,899
from a joke video to a really serious

222
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:45,909
thing actually hey situation which is

223
00:07:43,899 --> 00:07:47,319
never fun and is completely unnecessary

224
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:49,029
right I was luck serious like I

225
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:50,800
obviously had a lot of work into the

226
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:52,449
content I create and like I'm very very

227
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,460
blessed to have an active group of

228
00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:57,039
followers or I don't like need to social

229
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:58,749
time off anybody to have anybody to like

230
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,979
be successful you know so like I pick

231
00:07:58,749 --> 00:08:01,120
and choose who I want on my channel and

232
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,529
I usually pay people that I'm really

233
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,759
close with like me and Maddie said in

234
00:08:02,529 --> 00:08:05,589
our original video like we've been close

235
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,210
friends for a long time we still are

236
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:08,349
every time somebody comes I was like wow

237
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:09,639
they're just using each other for

238
00:08:08,349 --> 00:08:11,319
fallers and it's like first of all it's

239
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:12,580
our job and obviously of course it's a

240
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:13,810
collaborative effort do you think we'd

241
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,800
want to be sitting here something in

242
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:17,919
front of a camera if I didn't like I

243
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,479
would we wouldn't know nobody would

244
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,460
filming Beauty video is just an FYI to

245
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:23,800
you guys out there really suck sometimes

246
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:25,660
just I got five to six hour process and

247
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,550
it's like really really hot and

248
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:29,410
lengthy it's tiring you just want to

249
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:31,120
stretch your back in it let me go to the

250
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:32,470
chiropractor by the end of it you're

251
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,419
dirty like you just want to wipe

252
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:36,130
everything off obviously it's fun and I

253
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:38,229
love my job but trust me when I say like

254
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:41,169
if somebody didn't want to do this we

255
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:43,030
would not be here trust me on that

256
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:44,950
yeah when you didn't mind make of it it

257
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:46,330
was like three hours it was a long time

258
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:48,520
yeah but like when you see the video

259
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:49,690
it's like yeah

260
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,010
a lot goes into it my house it seems

261
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:52,180
that nobody really sees and knows about

262
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:53,470
I mean I love that at the end of the day

263
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:55,060
obviously would not be here like if I

264
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:56,140
didn't enjoy it but it just sucks that

265
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:58,680

00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:02,140

362
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,690
three-part series of the en or probably

363
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:57,980
a blank canvas just because they usually

364
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:59,300
on a club I was really proud of it cause

365
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,560
it was really awesome to look back on

366
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,330
everything that I've done in the past

367
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,860
year because like it has been an

368
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:05,780
emotional roller coaster with bullying

369
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:07,100
really highs and also really lows like

370
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:08,600
even like while editing that like a

371
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:10,400
little remember I was like snapchatting

372
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,780
I was sobbing crying it was so

373
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,040
embarrassing but I was also just like a

374
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:14,450
really vulnerable moment for me just

375
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,670
like I just put a lot of heart and soul

376
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:18,260
into a lot so I think that's definitely

377
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,460
like one of my all-time favorites and I

378
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:21,920
think it will probably forever be oh

379
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:24,440
yeah never in a million years would have

380
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,420
ever thought I'd like be here right so

381
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:28,190
weird we never thought we'd like be on a

382
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:30,320
reality show and then now we're here you

383
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:31,880
know a statement suck you really never

384
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,990
know what I thought that's gonna happen

385
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,000
then it just kind of does and you're

386
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:37,100
like wow I had no clue was going on when

387
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,800
I was like six yeah ladies were

388
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:42,020
following me around and I was like yeah

389
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,550
sometimes I feel like we didn't really

390
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:45,230
have a childhood you know like we've

391
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:47,030
never been like a proper one there was

392
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:48,560
just cameras on us like all the time a

393
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:50,120
lot of people think that like being

394
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,980
famous really having a following itself

395
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,420
is all fun and games but it really is

396
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:54,710
there's like a big dark side to it that

397
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:56,060
not a lot of people get to see a lot of

398
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:57,590
people don't think about just because

399
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:59,000
they think like oh you're on TV you're

400
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:00,560
making money you would relate these cool

401
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,510
things but in reality like there's a

402
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,740
really huge lack of privacy there and

403
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:05,600
obviously we get to kind of pick and

404
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:07,400
choose now what we decide to share with

405
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,570
people but at the same time like it's

406
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,950
sometimes really hard for people to

407
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:11,420
respect those boundaries and really know

408
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:12,350
like when to kind of leave you alone or

409
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:14,150
when to kind of like ah let you do your

410
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:15,530
own thing and it's sometimes hard to say

411
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:16,880
only can't make this Joker I can't say

412
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:18,830
this or talk about this or be seen with

413
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,600
this person or go to this restaurant or

414
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:22,160
do this activity because it might come

415
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,930
off to the general public in this sort

416
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,580
of way it's like it's just really

417
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:28,940
strange to have to like constantly be

418
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:30,410
thinking about that at all times they

419
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:32,270
can do anything you're not having to

420
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:34,130
think twice about a situation yeah

421
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:38,270
but we're like wait if we do this are we

422
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:39,590
gonna get like no it definitely is the

423
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:41,150
choice that we chose to live at this

424
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:42,200
point I'm really thankful for honesty

425
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:43,700
like it's like a battle that I'm willing

426
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,360
to fight every day but it is really

427
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,379
crazy

428
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,329
something that people really don't think

429
00:14:45,379 --> 00:14:48,920
about ever okay be honest I know you're

430
00:14:47,329 --> 00:14:53,480
like competing too but like does it

431
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:55,489
really look bad it's like you never

432
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,350
finished the other it's like we're just

433
00:14:55,489 --> 00:15:01,220
like stop it and you just don't connect

434
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:02,839
the lines the heart was also really my

435
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:05,149
dear the minute I was watching Dance

436
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:07,489
Moms and you were at like age seven

437
00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:09,379
walking out with the foulest glam ever

438
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:11,899
with like yellow glitter on there I

439
00:15:09,379 --> 00:15:13,459
would why I loved it every time it was

440
00:15:11,899 --> 00:15:15,529
so funny to me I was like these girls

441
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:18,230
will be gonna have you but most busted

442
00:15:15,529 --> 00:15:20,509
crusted dusted busted scanning ever yes

443
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:23,509
by the time they're like 12 yes

444
00:15:20,509 --> 00:15:24,920
no no surprisingly we never broke out if

445
00:15:23,509 --> 00:15:26,779
we had chewed at competitions we would

446
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:28,939
sleep in our eyelashes week oh and just

447
00:15:26,779 --> 00:15:30,049
did I was gonna thought we'd have to get

448
00:15:28,939 --> 00:15:32,449
ready in the morning for competition

449
00:15:30,049 --> 00:15:34,069
like 5:30 he used to wake up yeah so

450
00:15:32,449 --> 00:15:35,869
anyway so what she would do is I would

451
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:37,670
do my makeup and I would roll her over

452
00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:38,899
while she's sleeping in did her full

453
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,610
face while she was sleeping that's a

454
00:15:38,899 --> 00:15:49,730
truce yeah and then waking up with

455
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:52,999
eyelashes on and everything okay middle

456
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:54,470
of my eyelid I find the one doing all

457
00:15:52,999 --> 00:15:56,959
the people's makeup a long set of

458
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:57,949
mascara and lashes the hardest thing

459
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,019
doing there was always lips

460
00:15:57,949 --> 00:16:02,720
I feel like lips are very very specific

461
00:16:00,019 --> 00:16:04,939
thing that can go so wrong

462
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,009
we're just like the slightest change of

463
00:16:04,939 --> 00:16:09,199
shape at the slightest like over liner I

464
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:11,179
don't know why yeah it's the worst I can

465
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:13,850
do myself educator yeah shame on

466
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:16,459

you to my beautiful sisters and friends

00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:05,639
and we will see you in the next one
