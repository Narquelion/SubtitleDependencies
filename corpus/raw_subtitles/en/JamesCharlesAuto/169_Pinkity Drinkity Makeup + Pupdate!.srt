00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,879
point and I also had to put on right

25
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,140
pink kitty drink edid this hoodie that

26
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:44,789

27
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,110
of my favorite bands Zoe and Brooke

28
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:47,789
shadow cheese guys love these at

29
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,710
absolute most and also a few days ago I

30
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:51,180
broke the nail which was so great but my

31
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,680
nail tech came over really quickly and

32
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,539
gave me a new set and for once we

33
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,699
decided to not do a nude but instead we

34
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:59,340
went with these pink drink nails which

35
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:00,750
are literally oh oh what you're

36
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,850
literally is so cute like are you

37
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,619
kidding me there's little stop oh stop

38
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,570
and we decided to do these pink drink

39
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:07,830
nails which are literally it's so cute

40
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,869
they look like the little strawberries

41
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:13,260
are embedded into my fingers just like

42
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:14,790
an actual oh oh my god just like an

43
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,979
actual pink drink from Starbucks I think

44
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,119
they turned out so so cute I do want to

45
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:20,340
give up proper credit to my friend

46
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:22,200
Leslie and her no time crazy Calderon

47
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,640
for inspiring these nails that did at

48
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,350
first and I just wanted to recreate them

49
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,060
and that keeps my don't talk Queenie for

50
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,200
doing them anyway clearly at this point

51
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,150
everyone knows that the obsession with

52
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,520
me and pink drinks has gone very very

53
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,229
far and somehow after being on YouTube

54
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,090
and doing makeup for almost four years I

55
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:37,590
have never actually done a pink drink

56
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,329
makeup look so if I could say would be

57
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,159
the perfect time to do so to just sit

58
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:42,420
down and play with makeup also while I

59
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:44,189
was thinking of ways that I could do it

60
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,990
this pink drink makeup look I remembered

61
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:48,390
that what my favorite accounts of all

62
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:50,610

63
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:53,970

my face on his arm oh my god they're

65
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,579
gonna be so much better tried to

66
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,960
recreate that look today but obviously

67
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:59,520
add my own twist with all that being

68
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,290
said I grab a snack or grab your pink

69
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,280

98
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:56,580
on anything and that is because being a

119
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,070
for everybody who's giving a really

120
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,640
really helpful tips about training a

121
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:34,829
puppy

122
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,540
in the comments because it was really it

123
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:38,370
really appreciated like I said in the

124
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:40,859
video I did at train at my puppy back

125
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:42,780
home when he grew up and my editor who

126
00:03:40,859 --> 00:03:44,609
lives me Louis also trained his puppy

127
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,959
but of course it's always helpful to

128
00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:47,220
learn and new tips and tricks from

129
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,030
anybody who's went through the same

130
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,070
situation

131
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:52,049
and anybody who may learn more we

132
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:53,160
honestly want him to be raised in the

133
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:55,019
best way possible but it's really

134
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,660
important that he learns quickly and

135
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:59,000
it's very very obedient because we do

136
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:00,800
a crazy life who want him to be happy

137
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,200
and healthy in terms of the training it

138
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:05,540
is going up really really well so far

139
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,280
thank God knock out what I hope it stays

140
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:08,720
that way it but we are about two weeks

141
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,970
in and he's pretty much fully a

142
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,380
potty-trained which we are so pumped

143
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:14,090
about I don't know how he managed to

144
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:15,890
pick it up so fast but he is such a

145
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:18,049
smart little puppy a lot of my close

146
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:19,850
friends and family have came over to him

147
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:21,650
which has been that so much fun as well

148
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:23,690
and he is my mom the absolute best

149
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:26,180
behavior with everybody I just like

150
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:28,670
don't know how we lucked out so much but

151
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:30,200
he is probably like one of the most calm

152
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:31,580
but most fun but most of all behaved

153
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,480
dogs I've ever seen in my entire life

154
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:37,790

product coming out and I want to support

211
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:21,810
my sister so I'm just going to a contour

212
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,039
in and do some blush and highlight using

213
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:25,410
this palette I think it is very very

214
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:28,470
beautiful I'm gonna grab my morphe M 405

215
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:29,610
and dip into the shade femme and let's

216
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,900
test this out so there's two other

217
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:33,660
colors in here for contouring we have a

218
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:35,789
femine also is heard we love a good cert

219
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:37,410
so that is the soft contour color and

220
00:06:35,789 --> 00:06:39,630
Serge is for really deepening out some

221
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:41,610
of those areas looks really pretty on my

222
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:44,099
skin tone okay love this so far no

223
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:45,240
chisel out the chin of course the shade

224
00:06:44,099 --> 00:06:46,770
femoris working out really really nicely

225
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,990
and I honestly like how this color looks

226
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:50,280
on my skintone quite a lot I'm gonna go

227
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:52,139
to my better go to mo I'm gonna go up

228
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,460
into a but one two five zero brush from

229
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:54,930
morphe which is a little bit of a bigger

230
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,550
fluffy brush and dip into the shade of

231
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:58,259
Serge this one looks like it is a very

232
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:59,639
very pivot that I'm gonna be very

233
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:01,199
careful about this but I'm gonna use its

234
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:03,210
color to do you bit up the cheekbone

235
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,440
okay that is very very parented I'm

236
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:05,550
gonna bomb that out in a second I like

237
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,840
how that's close deeper but still has

238
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,220
the neutral undertone so it doesn't look

239
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,229
absolutely crazy

240
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:12,539
I do however think this is a little bit

241
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:14,940
dark for my skin tone this is looking a

242
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:17,010
little bit intense so I'm not going to

243
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:18,630
choose any more of that but I think for

244
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:20,639
a medium to tan skin tones that color is

245
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:22,590
going to be absolutely perfect oh we

246
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,599
thought so looks good Isaiah chiseled

247
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:27,389
contour if I ever did see one I'm gonna

248
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:29,340
grab my nose a contouring brush and grab

249
00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:32,280
a little bit of a femme again and we're

250
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:33,990
going to snatch this sister schnoz that

251
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,389
sentence was ridiculously annoying sorry

252
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:38,490
about that color looks really good on my

253
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:39,509
nose contour oh my god okay that looks

00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:41,009

ea4 brush and debated the shade BB a

257
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:47,520
girl which is the more pinky rose tone

258
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:48,659
color in the palette normally I would go

259
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,150
with tea girl and I'm very very excited

260
00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:52,740
to try this but census as a more a pink

little bit of this on the cheekbone oh

275
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:24,600
wow that is really really pretty I like

276
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,669
that it's a little bit more of a subtle

277
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,740
glow you can definitely layer it up but

278
00:08:26,669 --> 00:08:30,810
also it's like really pretty but has a

279
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:32,490
little bit of a larger particle size so

280
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:34,680
it's more glittery than just like a

281
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:36,750
normal glow from within type of

282
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,650

like this screen of this great and this

320
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,060
pink will be really really good for

321
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:55,560
creating at these Starbucks pinky

322
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,760
chickadee colors alright you guys so to

323
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,230
start off we're gonna grab a tiny little

324
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,150
angle brush and dip into the shade of

325
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,210
course pinky drink Kitty and at the

326
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,710
James house

327
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:04,510
power I'm gonna give that a little bit

328
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:05,770
of a spritz of the prepping settings

329
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:07,690
right just so it is a little bit more

330
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:09,910
sticky and I'm gonna start sketching out

331
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:11,590
my winged liner that is looking nice and

332
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,880
sharp amazing obviously you're gonna

333
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:14,530
clean that up with concealer in a second

334
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,810
anyway with whatever's excess on my

335
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:19,090
brush is going to use this concealer to

336
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:21,370
cut that wing and then with a tiny

337
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:23,650
little liner brush I'm going to go in

338
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:25,750
and start sketching out the little

339
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:27,610
triplets going on those are so cute I

340
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:29,290
love the little pink drinks flying liner

341
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:30,790
normally for a colored liner like this I

342
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:32,980
would normally use a liquid lipstick but

343
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:34,720
I could not find a color like a pink a

344
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,400
teaching kitty and my actual collection

345
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,190
despite the fact that it's like a light

346
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:41,020
pink all my nudes are more peachy tones

347
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:42,310
so the shadow will work just as well I

348
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:43,480
know this looks ridiculous right now but

349
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:45,640
give it a few seconds it's gonna come

350
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:48,760
together I'm now gonna grab a tiny

351
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:50,410
little a liner brush and dip into the

352
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,450
shade a little bit of a daddy from my

353
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:53,890
palette and a little bit of a one from

354
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,970
the verbena palette pretty much makes

355
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:56,740
like the exact

356
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:58,150
Starbucks a green I'm just gonna do the

357
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:00,070
same exact thing this person is a little

358
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:02,530
bit of prep and set I'm going to use

359
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:04,000
this color to make a double wing now

360
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:06,520
that is all laid out and I got my Tom

361
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,340
Florida black eyeliner and very very

362
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:10,990
very carefully outline the pink section

363
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:12,190
there are a lot of areas that I still

364
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:13,990
tried to get better and make up every

365
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:16,150
single time that I do it but the

366
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:18,940
absolute one thing that I am so bad at

367
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:20,980
that I wish I was better at is wholly an

368
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:22,270
eyeliner study I cannot make an even

369
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:24,940
straight line for the life of me it is

370
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:27,160
so beyond annoying okay that looks

371
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:29,130
honestly good great okay now let's do a

372
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:32,350
line in between the pink and the green

373
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:33,640
so close okay let's try and cover that

374
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:35,040
up in the meantime let me add some

375
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:38,660
little white highlights

376
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:41,040
[Music]

377
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:43,230
okay that looks kind of good let's go

378
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,150
ahead and move on to the lower lash line

379
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:47,400
I'm gonna grab those same a little bit

380
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:50,370
of a pink shadows on my little liner

381
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:52,080
brush and put them in my waterline and

382
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:54,360
in this run he actually added a really

383
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:56,760
long pink drip underneath the eye which

384
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,590
i think is super super cool so I'm going

385
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,120
to go ahead and do that as well and the

386
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:01,890
lower quarter this I hear he has like

387
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,470
this red part which I believe is like

388
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:06,150
the strawberry guts for lack of a better

389
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:08,550
term because they have the freeze dried

390
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:10,950
strawberries in the actual drink so I'm

391
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:12,870
going to grab a red liquid lipstick and

392
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:14,910
try to do that eyes Wow I'm gonna add a

393
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:16,380
little bit of a reddit shadowing on the

394
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:18,330
drip just like in the original photo

395
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:19,560
maybe another little dollop of white

396
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:20,850
just for highlights

397
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,620
I feel like this little dollop should

398
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:24,870
have an outline it doesn't in the

399
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:26,550
original photo but I'm gonna add this

400
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:27,660
little red inner corner light or thing

401
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:29,400
that we have going on because that is

402
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:31,800
there's no photo and it looks super chic

403
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:34,290
and now it's a little bit of a green and

404
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,250
the lower lash line this is strawberry a

405
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:37,680
little bit of you're kidding from the

406
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:40,230
palette yep that's what okay now that

407
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:43,500
actually you can make a strawberry on my

408
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:46,890
eyebrow this I am concerned about I am

409
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:48,450
going to rob do you read at first this

410
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:50,370
the top of the strawberry is usually

411
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:52,920
pretty flat so let's go ahead and do

412
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:55,080
that now we can go ahead and safely it

413
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:58,050
fill this in completely with red should

414
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:59,820
it be bigger than this yeah yeah oh let

415
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:02,040
me set that in place using you're

416
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:04,290
kidding from my palette and a little bit

417
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:06,300
of c2 from the verbena pellet having a

418
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:07,980
little bit of a boutique from my palette

419
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:10,380
I'm going to add a little bit of like a

420
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:12,230
darker area of the strawberry over here

421
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:16,150
leaving the side highlighted and

422
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:19,700
I'm going to grab my liner brush which

423
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:21,350
is right here and add some white and I'm

424
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:23,540
gonna add in the seeds back so it should

425
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:25,220
actually be a pure white blob at first

426
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:26,930
now what the red once again let's add

427
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:30,290
some seeds back in there let's go ahead

428
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:32,900
and add these stem of the strawberry now

429
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:36,970
a darker green for some shadow using it

430
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:39,440
daddy from the pallet to shade this in

431
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:41,300
wow that's so much harder to do that I

432
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,870
thought it was gonna be oh my gosh that

433
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,760
looks okay

434
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:45,350
it looks okay but it's time to move on

435
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,390
first or now it's time for the other eye

436
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:49,520
and this eye is going to be the actual

437
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:54,560
pink train okay let's all in the drink

438
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:55,850
first there we go okay that's actually

439
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,050

440
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:58,850

I literally posted one that was just

451
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:18,980
like a posing video I wanted to do I

452
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:21,050
literally started filming a pink drink

453
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:22,130
like transformation Tech Talk at the

454
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:23,510
beginning of this video and then got

455
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:25,040
distracted and forgot so that's really

456
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:26,210
really great but let me know if you guys

457
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,380
want to see me actually do tic TOCs

458
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:28,670
because it's kind of fun it's kind of

459
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:31,520
rushed I mean all my should be a tick

460
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:34,100
tock clean okay that shape looks great

461
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:35,990
driving ajh of 41 Russians gonna grab

462
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:38,780
some a pink Adia drink Adia from the

463
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:41,360
palette and set that in place now let's

464
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:42,650
add some little strawberry bits in there

465
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,150
okay so then for these shell guys are

466
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:45,590
gonna top some of them in and cover them

467
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:47,480
with a little bit of shadow as well

468
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:48,740
that way we'll add some and dimension in

469
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,450
and it'll look like some of the shaw

470
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:52,580
berries or like right up against the

471
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:53,960
edge of the cup but some are like

472
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:55,070
actually floating kind of in the middle

473
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,230
of the drink and those would therefore

474
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:58,280
be like a little bit more cloudy and

475
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,990
then the ones that the edge would look

476
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,310
like bright red if that makes sense and

477
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:02,690
then whatever's left on that brush was

478
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:04,610
gonna add in some with nice little like

479
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:05,930
patches of darker red all around the

480
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:07,649
drink just for somebody's added

481
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:09,449
dimension just so doesn't look like

482
00:15:07,649 --> 00:15:11,430
one color like that looks really really

483
00:15:09,449 --> 00:15:13,110
good now taking that drink once again

484
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:14,999
I'm gonna add in something could you

485
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:17,069
drink it right over top of this so it

486
00:15:14,999 --> 00:15:19,259
looks like the shower buddies are cloudy

487
00:15:17,069 --> 00:15:21,540
just like I said that looks really

488
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:23,399
really good okay now with that same

489
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:25,800
technique I'm gonna add a little bit of

490
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:27,720
white splotches in the top of the drink

491
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,339
to kind of look like ice cubes but also

492
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,050
the foam that comes to the top when you

493
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:33,689
first order I think I need a few more

494
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:35,160
little red splotches in here is taking a

495
00:15:33,689 --> 00:15:36,749
long time I'm gonna take that flat brush

496
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,339
from before that I use to fill in the

497
00:15:36,749 --> 00:15:39,600
pink kitty drink a tea cup and just

498
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:41,790
clean it off with a little bit of a

499
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,100
makeup wipe and I'm going to dip fully

500
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:45,689
into the white so I'm gonna add on a

501
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,639
rectangle for the top that'll be the lid

502
00:15:45,689 --> 00:15:49,860
now I'm gonna grab a tiny little brush

503
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:54,869
and some flash back and set that way in

504
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:57,119
place that looks so good Wow okay it's

505
00:15:54,869 --> 00:15:59,129
turning out great okay now I want to add

506
00:15:57,119 --> 00:16:01,769
the little bit of like shadows that

507
00:15:59,129 --> 00:16:04,730
basically are like the dividers in the

508
00:16:01,769 --> 00:16:06,809
cup so what I need to do first is a

509
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:08,790
taste like paint drink okay so I'm gonna

510
00:16:06,809 --> 00:16:10,740
add a shadow below also gonna add a

511
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:12,720
slight outline to the entire drink now

512
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,889
I'm gonna add my two little dividend

513
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,809
lines in the bottom I'm actually gonna

514
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:17,639
go to the shade is C 4 and a little bit

515
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:19,170
of B 3 from the marina pellet to those

516
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:20,639
because it'll be like a deeper pink

517
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:23,339
which I think will be good instead of

518
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,139
like a brown yeah yeah oh my god yes and

519
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:26,670
then one more time for here just buffing

520
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:28,350
that out using a little bit of a pink

521
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:30,600
add a trinket Ian let me are gonna miss

522
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:33,569
Starbucks this is where I'm actually

523
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:35,100
worried the circle hostel like and here

524
00:16:33,569 --> 00:16:37,050
well I don't really know how I'm gonna

525
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,889
do this with my eyelid fold there well

526
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:39,600
the original look was cleared on

527
00:16:37,889 --> 00:16:42,420
somebody's arm where an eyelid fold is

528
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:47,189
not an issue but this is definitely a

529
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:48,809
problem yeah I guess I could just do the

530
00:16:47,189 --> 00:16:50,910
green circle instead of doing the entire

531
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:53,360
Starbucks logo this is falling apart

532
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,360
rather quickly

533
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:59,120
let's leave a little bit out I'm gonna

534
00:16:55,910 --> 00:17:01,459
add the three little lines that are like

535
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,079
D little measuring lines on the side of

536
00:17:01,459 --> 00:17:04,579
the cuff so we're gonna do that we're

537
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:05,780
here that they're gonna be like in my

538
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:07,370
actual pupils we're not gonna include

539
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:08,839
that one okay so I'm gonna add a straw

540
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:10,010
to this cup just to it match the

541
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:11,949
original and so the drink is more

542
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:14,240
recognizable as an actual drink but

543
00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:16,159
y'all know I did not use a plastic

544
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,659
straws my local Starbucks actually has

545
00:17:16,159 --> 00:17:19,549
these reusable lids which is a super

546
00:17:17,659 --> 00:17:26,059
super awesome save the turtles and I

547
00:17:19,549 --> 00:17:27,350
hope you guys are so close to being done

548
00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:29,000
okay now I'm just gonna add it some

549
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:35,990
green and liner to match the

550
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:38,630
left-hand-side end with that same red

551
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:40,549
color for that little rat point just a

552
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:41,480
little bit of green on the lash line I

553
00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:43,580
am obsessed with all this look is

554
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:46,370
looking so far I will say and but this

555
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:48,950
took way way longer than anticipated oh

556
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:50,030
my god those are the eyes all complete I

557
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:52,190
decided it was best to not actually

558
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:53,150
include the Starbucks logo I normally

559
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:54,590
would be down for the challenge of

560
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:56,900
drawing it but because of the eyelid

561
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:57,980
fold it it's really just not going to

562
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,659
work her head will be flopping all

563
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:00,830
around in there and it's just not gonna

564
00:17:59,659 --> 00:18:02,240
be good I'm gonna leave it the way it is

565
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,370
I might even Photoshop about the dancer

566
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:09,260
and picture who knows regardless I'm

567
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:10,909
gonna behad on some mascara oh my god

568
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:14,000
forgot the word I'm gonna grab the a

569
00:18:10,909 --> 00:18:16,400
brand new Lily lashes ox ox ox mascara

570
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,210
it is really really bobby guys oh my

571
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,030
good you know what I also want to talk

572
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:23,690
about with you guys okay Mario Kart tour

573
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:25,880
for the iPhone oh my god after literally

574
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:28,039
in 3 million years of waiting Nintendo

575
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,120
finally released Mario Kart for iPhone

576
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:31,309
and I've never been more excited for

577
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,559
anything literally in my entire life I

578
00:18:31,309 --> 00:18:35,900
have an absolute Mario Kart scene it was

579
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:37,420
my all-time favorite game as a kid this

580
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,950
is before my minecraft era

581
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:41,050
we go home from school every single day

582
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:43,450
and stand on my base and play at Mario

583
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:44,950
Kart Wii and I was so good at it I don't

584
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:46,390
know if it's embarrassing or impressive

585
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:48,580
to a bit but I literally used to hold a

586
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:49,900
few different world records in the game

587
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:51,040
I can't believe two submitted that on

588
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,420
camera when it comes to makeup I would

589
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,250
definitely say like I'm pretty good at

590
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:55,720
it I mean it is my job I do all the time

591
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:57,490
I come up with some pretty beautiful

592
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,080
looks but there's so many artists that I

593
00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:00,130
genuinely think are like a million miles

594
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,720
ahead of me and that's awesome because

595
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:03,850
it gives me room to always grow and

596
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,290
practice more and more but Mario Kart on

597
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:07,480
the other hand I can't even be humble

598
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:10,060
about it you guys Mario Kart I'm so good

599
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:12,670
like I'm I'm truly a queen of Mario Kart

600
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:13,810
and I've been waiting four years now for

601
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:16,030
them to finally bring it up for the

602
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:17,410
iPhone and it is here I downloaded a few

603
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,700
minutes ago for pre-order and last night

604
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:20,860
it finally became available and I've

605
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:22,120
been playing it non-stop and I have

606
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,230
quite a lot of thoughts okay on a

607
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,360
positive note the graphics and

608
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:26,980
performance of the actual app absolutely

609
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,720
stunning it looks so it I've honestly

610
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:31,410
never even seen an iPhone game with like

611
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,610
that level of quality it looks visually

612
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:35,770
phenomenal the controls on the other

613
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:36,970
hand they just make no sense when I was

614
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:38,590
first playing it orion's we have that

615
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:40,510
meme of the Kardashians episode when

616
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:41,890
Khloe is driving the car around and then

617
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:45,210
it cuts to the clip of the van just

618
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:45,210
floating around in the sky

619
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,930
because that's what I literally felt

620
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,340
like what's going on with my cart no

621
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:53,780
matter which way I turn toward my

622
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:55,850
fingers I would go the complete wrong

623
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:57,260
way so steering is definitely a little

624
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:59,390
bit of a challenge and I hope that they

625
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:00,620
kind of improve the controls as an avid

626
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:01,730
fan I'm definitely a little bit

627
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:03,050
disappointed but I'm definitely looking

628
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:04,970
forward to hearing what you guys have to

629
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:06,740
say about it I am a very very Punk for

630
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:08,000
them to open up multiplayer mode in a

631
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:09,320
few days from now when it doesn't up

632
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,550
releasing I will probably post my friend

633
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,930
call on my Twitter so you guys can all

634
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:13,550
add me and then I can it whoop all of

635
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:14,690
your asses in the game and regards of

636
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:16,430
whatever I think about it I'm still

637
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:18,860
clearly addictively playing it and so is

638
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:19,910
literally the entire world now so let me

639
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:21,980
know what your guys thoughts are and

640
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:23,270
down below and let's get ready to race

641
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:24,770
alright you guys now that that is all

642
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:26,510
I'm gonna get my face a nice spritz of

643
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:28,130
some wrapping stuff settings right just

644
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:29,690
to kind of melt everything I'm back into

645
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:31,520
place because it has been done literally

646
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:32,840
like three or four hours since I put on

647
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,070
my base routine and she's looking a

648
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,320
little bit crusty I'm gonna dip it back

649
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:37,820
into the dragon a beauty of palette and

650
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,840
got me a smaller brush and we're just

651
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:42,470
gonna add our second layer of

652
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:43,670
highlighter onto the other side in the

653
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:44,990
original photo by shine and shadows he

654
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:47,120
did give me a little bit of freckles so

655
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:50,030
I am gonna put some nice pink and orange

656
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,320
blush on my nose and add those and just

657
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:52,520
because they're very very cute and

658
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,470
youthful and then I was gonna add it a

659
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:56,030
few freckles like a normal head last but

660
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:57,530
finally and not least to finish off this

661
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:59,900
makeup look I'm just gonna grab a nude

662
00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:01,040
lip liner has a lace and then I was

663
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:03,080
gonna finish it off with a little bit of

664
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,400
a gloss it's nice and juicy already you

665
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,140
go use this several hours and several

666
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,730
pink kitty drink it is later this is

667
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:09,230
number three just like the mario kart

669
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:13,690
embarrassed by this but this biggity

00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:15,950
