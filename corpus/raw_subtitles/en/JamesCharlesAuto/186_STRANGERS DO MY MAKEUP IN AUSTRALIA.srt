1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,859
good eye sisters James talks here

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,819
welcome back to my youtube channel that

3
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:06,930
was good in frosh

4
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:08,250
so for today's video I thought it'd be

5
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,440
so much fun to do something that we are

6
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,820
seated over in my homeland which is Los

7
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,920
Angeles such as strangers they make up

8
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,170
on Hollywood Boulevard but clearly we

9
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,670
are not in Hollywood or on a boulevard

10
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,840
we are in Surfers Paradise here on the

11
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,160
Gold Coast and I thought I would stand

12
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,109
here today and let a bunch of strangers

13
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,670
do my makeup so last video I know there

14
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:24,990
were a ton of sisters hopefully there'll

15
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,279
be a lot of sisters here today hopefully

16
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,689
I'll also go to get cleaned up by some

17
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:29,220
really hot surfer dudes as well with

18
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:30,840
some washboard abs in six-packs that we

19
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,369
can find in the water as you can see the

20
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,910
ocean is very clear today so the chances

21
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:34,500
of that

22
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:35,969
like my relationship life are looking

23
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,110
very very slim we tied it to this

24
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,550
yesterday and for some reason the world

25
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,930
was just really really a gun stuff this

26
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:42,870
could either go really really good or

27
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:44,180
really really bad doo doo doo doo doo

28
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:47,030

186
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:56,470

194
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,210
getting kicked the entire time but it

195
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:12,070

I'm gonna start in the middle of the eye

00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,800
and I'm gonna drag it up and out because

216
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,720
the eye shadow is already really winging

217
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,190

make it really thin and gradually get

236
00:09:40,629 --> 00:09:43,620
