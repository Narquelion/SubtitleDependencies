00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,929
hi sisters James Charles here and

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,339
welcome back to my youtube channel for

3
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:06,779
today's video we're doing something that

4
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:08,700
you guys have been at literally begging

5
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:10,740
for it requesting for a comforting about

6
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,410
four years now and that is the zodiac

7
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,910
makeup challenge now I have not been

8
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,560
ignoring you I am actually been putting

9
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,960
this video on and I'm going to tell you

10
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,390
why please don't kill me in the comments

11
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,000
but I don't exactly believe in astrology

12
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,470
I know okay I might be probably the only

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,660
person in all of Los Angeles California

14
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,699
that does not believe in this I don't

15
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,309
really believe and like anything and I

16
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:36,270
feel like basing life decisions on stars

17
00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:37,530
that sky is a little bit weird but a few

18
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,090
weeks ago I was talking to my good

19
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,500
friend at noir Vina who's the president

20
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,450
and creative director of Anasazi Beverly

21
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,820
Hills and she was telling me how I am

22
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,300
like the most Gemini Gemini she's ever

23
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,550
met

24
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,079
and this really sparked my brain because

25
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,610
I had no idea what any of that meant

26
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:52,590
so I called my mom I asked my birth

27
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,420
certificate and the time and location of

28
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,980
my birth I put it in at the co star app

29
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,449
and then sort of doing a whole lot of

30
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,250
research and I will admit to you live on

31
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:00,690
camera right now that I was shook

32
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,910
because some of the things in my

33
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:04,140
horoscope were extremely accurate to

34
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,240
what I'm actually feeling and going

35
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,100
through in my life so for today's video

36
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,900
I thought it'd be super fun to sit down

37
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,520
play what's the makeup of course we did

38
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,530
some research I'm about to find out how

39
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,060
being a Gemini affects my relationships

40
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,920
my friendships my communication skills

41
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,570
my artistry and a personality my

42
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,130
business and literally everything else

43
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:21,689
and maybe by the end of this video I'll

44
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:24,460
be a believer in astrology

45
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:29,229
let's get started

46
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:31,429
[Music]

47
00:01:29,229 --> 00:01:33,079
alright you guys jumping right into this

48
00:01:31,429 --> 00:01:34,250
as you can see I actually already have a

49
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:35,810
full face to makeup on

50
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:38,090
don't worry that's about to change very

51
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:40,189
very quickly like I said I am NOT very

52
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:42,829
educated on astrology or being a Gemini

53
00:01:40,189 --> 00:01:44,780
at all but the one stereotype that I

54
00:01:42,829 --> 00:01:47,270
have heard a million different times is

55
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:50,270
that Gemini's are two-faced personally

56
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:51,799
okay I feel like I am NOT two-faced if I

57
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:53,810
love you I love you and you're gonna

58
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:55,340
know and if I don't like you I am NOT

59
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:57,739
that a person to go out of my way to

60
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,939
fake it like people also definitely know

61
00:01:57,739 --> 00:02:00,140
we're gonna learn more about this in the

62
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:02,390
video setting to see how this actually

63
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:03,950
like affects our decisions as Gemini's

64
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:05,270
but I do have a super cool idea for this

65
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:07,250
make a book tonight and that is going to

66
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:09,140
be representing at the two different

67
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:11,120
ways that you guys see me as an

68
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:12,769
influencer on 1/2 my face I'm gonna keep

69
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,060
it natural and this look that I have on

70
00:02:12,769 --> 00:02:15,980
right now and that is kind of like my

71
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:17,780
day to day it go to glam it's almost

72
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,879
like my off-camera look that you guys

73
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:21,349
don't always get to see whereas on this

74
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:23,269
side I really want to represent my

75
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:25,129
youtube personality the over-the-top

76
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:26,569
kind of like on brand James Charles that

77
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:28,489
you guys all know and love colorful

78
00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:30,980
bright unapologetic but overall just

79
00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:33,109
confidence on this side so let's go

80
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:35,239
ahead and jump in alright so as I take

81
00:02:33,109 --> 00:02:37,069
off this side of my face Luis is going

82
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:38,930
to read me of my daily horoscopes today

83
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:40,639
ready to receive your blessings you

84
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:42,440
might be disappointed by the way your

85
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:42,889
surroundings react to new things coming

86
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,079
your way

87
00:02:42,889 --> 00:02:47,030
self-awareness is the key to

88
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:51,650
understanding any relationship issues

89
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:54,079
these days is bad some tea instead of

90
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:55,760
thinking about ways of others think

91
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:57,530
about your own decisions and choices

92
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,120
that legend here and think about the

93
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:01,950
change you wish to make to your own

94
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,660
so this is really saying think about how

95
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:05,700
my own actions are affecting it

96
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:09,209
situations rather than how others are

97
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:10,650
affecting situations mm-hmm see this

98
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:11,819
it's like things like this that makes me

99
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,590
a little skeptical about this because

100
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:15,720
like that was the most general statement

101
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:19,019
ever like Oh think about yourself anyway

102
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:31,230
okay I mean I think I think a lot about

103
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:32,790
myself I do always love a bit this

104
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:34,650
makeup look today at by the way is going

105
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:36,090
to be inspired by a Taylor Graham MUA on

106
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:37,019
Twitter and since we're gonna be talking

107
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,750
I want to tell you guys I'm gonna be

108
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:41,459
using the morphe 35o icy fantasy palette

109
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:43,170
this is their new pastel collaboration

110
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:47,640
with pony it is so beautiful and you can

111
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:53,239
use code aims for 10% off just draw

112
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:53,239
great strength gentle gentle

113
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,699
[Music]

114
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:04,170
I definitely feel like I'm extremely

115
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:05,850
adaptable like you can put me in any new

116
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:08,489
environment or any situation and I will

117
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:11,400
always try my best to succeed I wouldn't

118
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:12,540
say however that I am very gentle I

119
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,340
guess it does depend on the situation

120
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:16,229
though on who I'm talking to like with

121
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,479
my friends and the ones that I love I'm

122
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:19,979
not very gentle but that's always like

123
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:21,060
out of tough love and like wanting

124
00:04:19,979 --> 00:04:23,010
everybody around me to be the best

125
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,479
versions of themselves but I will say I

126
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:26,070
am good at giving advice and like

127
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,780
helping other people out and in those

128
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:29,970
situations I mean one more time tall

129
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,720
okay so now if this is says you're

130
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,560
nervous

131
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,990
oh I strongly disagree with that

132
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:39,090
inconsistent disagree indecisive

133
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:40,710
oh that's too nervous I do not think I'm

134
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:45,720
nervous at all I do not get nervous

135
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:47,310
rarely ever I do that's a recent thing

136
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,990
though yeah but overall I would not say

137
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:50,850
that I'm a nervous person I don't think

138
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:53,410
that's the case

139
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:56,080
oops then it's a little blurb about when

140
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:58,450
you like it dislike you like music books

141
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,360
magazine and chiming with anybody and

142
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:03,130
short trips around town that is so

143
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,370
accurate it's not even funny that is so

144
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:09,070
that is T Gemini dislikes being alone

145
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:13,510
being young repetition and y'all team

146
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:15,220
huh that's T I hate being alone

147
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:17,200
literally that's what Lewis loves of me

148
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:18,550
I always have friends over every single

149
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,440
day I always have to film with somebody

150
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:22,450
in the room I love having people over

151
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,920
I hate repetition I literally get so

152
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:25,150
bored doing the same thing I always have

153
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:32,440
to be doing something new let's keep

154
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:33,820
going this is fine that have strong

155
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,230
opinions and personalities and they

156
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:37,510
often need to be the center of attention

157
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:39,640
they are a highly versatile love a good

158
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:41,620
argument but will often butt heads with

159
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:44,260
those who opinions differ from their own

160
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:46,480
it takes a lot to hold a Gemini's

161
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:48,400
attention span though once they find

162
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,770
their passion they go in all the way

163
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,520
Gemini is the sign of kindred spirit

164
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:55,060
energy

165
00:05:51,520 --> 00:06:00,460
Gemini loves a dynamic duo and is always

166
00:05:55,060 --> 00:06:02,530
seeking their other oh my god they that

167
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:04,480
is a full entire that is a whole entire

168
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:06,370
Drive I mean it's true literally like I

169
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,419
like I said I do enjoy company I love

170
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:09,340
being around my friends and I also

171
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:12,400
really what am I not Gemini's are

172
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:15,430
changeable and open mind that makes them

173
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,290
excellent artists especially writers and

174
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:19,440
journalists and their skills and

175
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:23,890
flexibility makes them shine and trade

176
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:25,870
driving and team sports driving try

177
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:28,360
Meghan oh that's a lie

178
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:30,610
team sports well I definitely am not

179
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,140
good at sports but when it comes to team

180
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:34,510
activities I definitely am a team player

181
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:36,100
I love a good healthy competition so

182
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:38,560
although I might not be the strongest

183
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:40,000
player on the team I will be a motivated

184
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,860
player on the team which is equally as

185
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,070

Gemini's see love first through

196
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:09,120
communication and verbal contact and

197
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:12,240

199
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,070

they are always ready to flirt a Gemini

201
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:21,600
go spend a lot of time with different

202
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:23,850
lovers until they find the right one who

203
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,950

when they find the right person a lover

a friend and someone to talk to combined

206
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:32,130
in one it will be faithful and

207
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:34,680
determined to always treasure their

208
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:36,780
heart I that is literally me like that's

209
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,980
me the paragraph I value communication

210
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,150
more than anything there was one guy

211
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,260
that I talked to and I'm not gonna go

212
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,620
into specifics because he's a very nice

213
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,610
person

214
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:44,010
but I was talking to you for a good

215
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:45,750
moment he was like 6-3 so insanely ha

216
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:47,460
beautiful face beautiful body really

217
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,900
really great outgoing personality I

218
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,640
truly thought that I was going to be

219
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,680
with him for a hot minute but

220
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:54,090
unfortunately when he flew home the

221
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,650
communication like completely dropped

222
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:57,180
out of the window and it went from like

223
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:58,950
talking every single day and spending a

224
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:00,900
week together to literally waiting 10

225
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:02,160
hours for a text message reply and I

226
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,870
tried to fix it and I tried to fix it

227
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,950
and I tried to fix it but I ultimately

228
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:06,510
realized that I could not change how a

229
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:08,070
person thinks or how they communicates

230
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:10,050
and that relationship really made me

231
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:12,420
realize that I value communication and

232
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:14,040
openness and honesty it's so incredibly

233
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:16,200
much the biggest challenge for any

234
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:18,390
Gemini's love life is to find an emotion

235
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:20,370
that lacks especially as they get older

236
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:22,410
and realize they are already in a

237
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:24,810
repetitive mode of superficial and

238
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:27,630
disappointing bonds their personality

239
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:30,000
doesn't allow much depth before they are

240
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:32,310
on a mission to spread information not

241
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,979
to dig into them and find mistakes holes

242
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:36,680
or resolutions they look at life from a

243
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:40,490
relative perspective of you

244
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:42,439
being the one to circle the Sun moving

245
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:44,329
forwards and backwards from earth one of

246
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:45,559
you never certain of their own direction

247
00:08:44,329 --> 00:08:46,910
the one thing I really made sense with

248
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:47,899
their personality doesn't allow much

249
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:49,639
depth I don't think it's your

250
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:50,509
personality but just situation you're

251
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:53,420
right there's it's not your personality

252
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:54,949
because I do have a lot to me but I

253
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,929
don't think I like talking about it much

254
00:08:54,949 --> 00:08:58,189
I'm not a very like vulnerable person I

255
00:08:56,929 --> 00:08:59,509
don't like going to in debt they're

256
00:08:58,189 --> 00:09:02,119
talking about my shark those are my

257
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:03,829
feelings my situation and my career does

258
00:09:02,119 --> 00:09:05,449
make it very difficult for me to kind of

259
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:06,709
get in depth in relationships and

260
00:09:05,449 --> 00:09:08,240
unfortunately I've had far more bad

261
00:09:06,709 --> 00:09:09,470
experiences with people that weren't

262
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,079
talking to me for the right intentions

263
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:14,660
then good so it is kind of like made me

264
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:16,369
build up my wall even higher they tend

265
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:19,730
to make a gazillion friends people

266
00:09:16,369 --> 00:09:22,189
information so Gemini's like to procure

267
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:24,290
a large garden of contacts Lincoln

268
00:09:22,189 --> 00:09:25,399
called on that said the emotional

269
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:27,769
requirements of maintaining

270
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:30,470
relationships and swiftly overwhelm them

271
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:33,769
and then honestly they just cut out the

272
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:35,869
dead boy away so true

273
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:37,129
I love talking to people I love making

274
00:09:35,869 --> 00:09:39,230
new friends I'm a very very social

275
00:09:37,129 --> 00:09:40,639
person but there's a lot of people that

276
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:42,589
I have to keep up with on a daily basis

277
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:43,759
in terms of my best friends my team that

278
00:09:42,589 --> 00:09:45,019
I work with a different business

279
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:46,999
contacts that were currently working on

280
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:49,279
projects but sometimes I do tend to

281
00:09:46,999 --> 00:09:50,809
overlook other conversations like there

282
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,220
have been definitely times where friends

283
00:09:50,809 --> 00:09:53,660
from my old high school or friends that

284
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:55,009
I was with when I like first started

285
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,240
social media that will come to me like

286
00:09:55,009 --> 00:09:57,589
well I feel like you really forgot about

287
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,360
me and it sucks to hear that because

288
00:09:57,589 --> 00:10:00,980
that was never the intention but it just

289
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,589
kind of does for me happen naturally

290
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:06,079
because I move on very very quickly and

291
00:10:03,589 --> 00:10:08,149
just like start new friendships that

292
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:09,889
socks that is definitely true though all

293
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:12,769
right let's do a little bit of career in

294
00:10:09,889 --> 00:10:14,839
constantly of intellectual stimulation

295
00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:16,879
this is just like literally reading

296
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:18,649
fulfill the most suitable job for a

297
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:21,319
Gemini has to be challenging to their

298
00:10:18,649 --> 00:10:23,509
brain there are skillful inventive and

299
00:10:21,319 --> 00:10:25,549
often very smart with a need for a

300
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:27,860
dynamic working environment and lots of

301
00:10:25,549 --> 00:10:31,040
social contacts I met in the office oh

302
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:32,720
my god it's a so little bit real of like

303
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,999
come on if they were created for

304
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,209
multitasking problem-solving and

305
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:44,189
bringing new ideas

306
00:10:36,209 --> 00:10:47,009
to life they need a workplace yeah I

307
00:10:44,189 --> 00:10:51,329
mean that's like hit that hit the hammer

308
00:10:47,009 --> 00:10:52,829
hurt Vinay I think that hits the nail on

309
00:10:51,329 --> 00:10:54,119
the head I do this job because I like

310
00:10:52,829 --> 00:10:55,589
being mentally stimulated I've talked

311
00:10:54,119 --> 00:10:57,269
about this a million different times and

312
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:58,920
I'm my own boss which is the blessing

313
00:10:57,269 --> 00:11:00,509
and that way I get to make sure that I

314
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:04,399
am NOT on a routine thing every single

315
00:11:00,509 --> 00:11:04,399
day wow this is crazy

316
00:11:05,329 --> 00:11:11,040
it says that mercury is a planet which

317
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:12,089
is associated with speed and geminis

318
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,230
think fast

319
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:19,769
eat fast move fast and talk to us oh

320
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:21,829
yeah they change their mind fast so much

321
00:11:19,769 --> 00:11:24,569
so that they can even meet themselves

322
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:26,819
coming back around the other way this

323
00:11:24,569 --> 00:11:28,199
can make them seem erratic because they

324
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:31,619
don't stick to their opinions or

325
00:11:28,199 --> 00:11:33,600
commitments Wow the speed thing I mean

326
00:11:31,619 --> 00:11:35,129
yeah let's be real I literally am the

327
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,050
fastest talker probably on YouTube aside

328
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:43,470
from Trisha Paytas or Joe Joey well what

329
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:46,499
should be a competition one day I'm up

330
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:48,149
Donny see what the cool people I will

331
00:11:46,499 --> 00:11:50,309
say that I have somebody who sticks by

332
00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:51,959
my opinions if I have an opinion I am

333
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:53,759
pretty out of it on it unless I

334
00:11:51,959 --> 00:12:02,749
presented with good information and

335
00:11:53,759 --> 00:12:04,949
reasoning to switch that Gemini man is

336
00:12:02,749 --> 00:12:06,689
enthusiastic and full of life never

337
00:12:04,949 --> 00:12:09,209
disappointing with dull moments he is

338
00:12:06,689 --> 00:12:10,799
adventurous humorous and this makes him

339
00:12:09,209 --> 00:12:13,679
the perfect partner if a person is

340
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:15,209
energetic and dynamic and search for

341
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:18,540
some laughter and

342
00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:20,670
yeah Joe my men are naturally chatty and

343
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:22,559
flirtatious and you can meet them at

344
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:24,689
public gatherings conferences and

345
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:26,429
traffic jams that's a weird thing to say

346
00:12:24,689 --> 00:12:28,199
you will never catch a traffic jam

347
00:12:26,429 --> 00:12:30,839
because I will not be in a car this man

348
00:12:28,199 --> 00:12:33,149
is impossible to cling to and need a

349
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:35,790
partner who gives him enough freedom and

350
00:12:33,149 --> 00:12:38,670
space followed by mental stimulation of

351
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:41,220
variety yeah that's definitely that's a

352
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:43,679
I cannot deal with clinginess I hate

353
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:46,050
clinginess I don't like flirting to

354
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:47,670
begin with I like doing the flirting I

355
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:49,709
like a man who's like gonna bully me a

356
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:51,300
little bit like a morning gonna like not

357
00:12:49,709 --> 00:12:54,920
like I'm learning pumpkin pie I like

358
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,920
your style shining so bright today I

359
00:13:00,259 --> 00:13:04,769
wonder what could be causing that okay

360
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,699
for our last hopper we're talking about

361
00:13:04,769 --> 00:13:10,110
the future right

362
00:13:05,699 --> 00:13:12,300
Oh God until December 18 2020

363
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:15,029
why is this looks specific what's gonna

364
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:17,129
happen on that day oh gosh okay there

365
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:20,100
continues to be a wonderful refreshing

366
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:22,290
focus on your private world for intimate

367
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,089
life a possible deepening of a

368
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:26,100
relationship or an increased

369
00:13:24,089 --> 00:13:28,100
understanding of your inner workings a

370
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:31,410
boost in your relationship with yourself

371
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:33,029
your intimate life enlarges and expands

372
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:35,220
bringing you more joy and your

373
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:38,279
discoveries I am definitely a man this

374
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:39,899
year it's in the stars written in the

375
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:41,970
stop during this cycle you learn to

376
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:44,429
embrace interchange in order to feel

377
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:46,769
more empowered there may be more

378
00:13:44,429 --> 00:13:49,559
opportunities to find support financial

379
00:13:46,769 --> 00:13:52,499
and/or emotional but you should be wary

380
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:54,329
of living on credit and borrowing too

381
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:56,910
heavily for the future during this

382
00:13:54,329 --> 00:13:58,470
year-long transit it is time to grab

383
00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:00,149
opportunities that help you feel

384
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:02,160
empowered and on top of your life

385
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:03,640
otherwise it's a strong period for

386
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,930
opening yourself up to others

387
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:07,510
you're not confident about your

388
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:09,550
emotional depths this is a period when

389
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:12,459
you can quite successfully purge

390
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:15,339
yourself of some of your inner demons

391
00:14:12,459 --> 00:14:17,740
guilt and buried psychological problems

392
00:14:15,339 --> 00:14:20,320
while there can be some reality checks

393
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:24,640
at times it's powerful time for

394
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:26,290
psychological oh oh my god so that's a

395
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,519
really good thing is coming a lot of

396
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:28,959
