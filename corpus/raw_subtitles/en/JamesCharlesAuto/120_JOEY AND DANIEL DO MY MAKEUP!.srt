I'm nervous the other side there's no

133
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:08,950
it's not good it's just more subtle 1 2

134
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,950
3

135
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:18,860
so let's run sister Joey's huh you did a

136
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:20,630
lot of bronzing and contouring hangout

137
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:22,280
but look how good it looks you look warm

138
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:26,000
you look fresh you look like you just

139
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:29,750
can use my gosh I was definitely better

140
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,370
at Daniels and tongue I will say that I

141
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:33,050
love to school it on literally perfectly

142
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:35,210
yeah that's clue it's like right in my

143
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:39,590
lashline you guys can see that that's

144
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:41,450
right yeah well I can't see I know the

145
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:43,130
glasses on so they're the color I

146
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:44,480
actually really like I normally would

147
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:46,220
never choose a little color like this

148
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,540
for myself of us I couldn't do a lot but

149
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:51,890
I don't like actually like it like the

150
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:52,400
little black Jetson or sister Daniel

151
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:53,720
side

152
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,460
foundation concealer powder at once

153
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,320
again you definitely didn't do as much

154
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:58,570
power as

155
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:02,820
that's for sure but I think my skin that

156
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:06,430
does look really really good stop okay

157
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:08,650
now I shadow is definitely better than

158
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:10,930
Joey sigh okay and that pay so it's

159
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:12,160
definitely you picked the red color yeah

160
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:13,450
but like the darker shade in the crease

161
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,920
of the make a nice little of the way

162
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:17,170
which is good but I wash on the other

163
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:19,390
hand looking a little on game for day

164
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:19,840
those lips the application was pretty

165
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,700
good

166
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:24,280
okay to your application is also good

167
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:27,010
for you both over line thank God thank

168
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:28,810
God the nose contour I think for both

169
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:31,690
sides as a little bit of a floppity

170
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:33,160
floppity world okay so I obviously like

171
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:34,450
both sides everything I can't even pick

172
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,920
a winner because Joey and Daniel both

173
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:38,020
put in a lot of effort and work which I

174
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,400
really really appreciate that's awesome

175
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:41,910
