this box I'm gonna do then I actually

164
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:58,529
think could not even put on lashes until

165
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:59,839
very recently if he's going on like

166
00:06:58,529 --> 00:07:02,789
Instagram feed

167
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:06,569
the first like maybe 20 looks that I

168
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:09,360
posted all had the last edited on the

169
00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:11,399
bat is hey something with the brush tool

170
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,930
like because I cannot figure out how to

171
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:14,699
put the one I glued my eye shop for

172
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:16,499
sometimes I come in hey you kidding no

173
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:18,749
now Ben is lining his upper waterline or

174
00:07:16,499 --> 00:07:20,759
thought associate darkside liner this

175
00:07:18,749 --> 00:07:22,680
just helps make like the liner and

176
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:24,959
lashes they blend all together and look

177
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,089
nice we did this off-camera and I tried

178
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:28,999
to do it and it was a disaster to

179
00:07:27,089 --> 00:07:31,559
steadily so that's it that's doing it

180
00:07:28,999 --> 00:07:33,629
it's a glass it does not say the most

181
00:07:31,559 --> 00:07:35,249
