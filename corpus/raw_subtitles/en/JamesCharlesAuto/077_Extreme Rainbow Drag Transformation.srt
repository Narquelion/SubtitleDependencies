00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,810
hi sisters James Charles here and

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:05,279
welcome back 22 panel as you guys know

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:06,629
Halloween is right around the corner I'm

4
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,429
posting this on a Tuesday and I think

5
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:10,380
Halloween is on Thursday this year so

6
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:11,639
pretty soon I am very very excited you

7
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,860
guys know this is literally my all-time

8
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:15,660
favorite time of the year I love love

9
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,100
love spooky season I don't know that so

10
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,930
many of you guys do as well so today I

11
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,970
am back with another Halloween themed

12
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,020
video and for today we're going to doing

13
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,570
with my favorite things in the entire

14
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,189
world a drag transformation now

15
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,680
personally a drag has influenced me it's

16
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:30,420
so so so much growing up I obviously

17
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,340
have transformed a few times I bought my

18
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,540
youtube channel out of my Instagram into

19
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,340
a drag me but I've never actually got

20
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,899
any real chance to perform or probably

21
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,940
for the better you guys are all covered

22
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:40,140
that but also I've learned so did for

23
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,670
makeup techniques from drag queens and

24
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,410
it pretty much my entire vocabulary at

25
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,969
this point is from RuPaul's Drag Race my

26
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,590
favorite show in the entire world so I

27
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:48,090
love drag I have so much respect for and

28
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:50,129
also Halloween is kind of like the

29
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,390
birthday of so many drag queens it is an

30
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:52,739
amazing time to obviously express

31
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,120
yourself I'll play with makeup and go in

32
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:55,530
costumes and this end of the year is a

33
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,610
lot of times that drag queens realize

34
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,800
that they have a true love for

35
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:00,120
performing and makeup artistry so for

36
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,309
today's video I thought it'd be so much

37
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,840
fun to sit down do a drag transformation

38
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:05,369
I have not done one in quite a long time

39
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,930
and obviously you guys know we just

40
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:09,330
released the morphe x change cause mini

41
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,770
palette so we're gonna go from this to

42
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,540
this if you guys want to see how I

43
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,230
created this look from head to toe keep

44
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:19,250
on watching

45
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:21,210
[Music]

46
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:22,829
how are you guys let's jump right into

47
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,420
this because it's going to be quite the

48
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:26,430
long video today and I'm gonna try to go

49
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,750
in-depth as possible so our first step

50
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:29,960
is always going to be to glue down our

51
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:32,729
eyebrows obviously I'm very very manly

52
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:34,829
square eyebrows that I want to lift them

53
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:36,899
up make them snatched for the gods and

54
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:38,189
we need to cover them in order to do so

55
00:01:36,899 --> 00:01:40,140
I normally put moisturizer on my face

56
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:41,819
first but I not put anything on today so

57
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,470
it's completely dry which means people

58
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:45,240
will be able to stick to it and I'm just

59
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,099
gonna grab a normal Elmer's washable

60
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,530
glue stick make sure it is the purple

61
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:51,539
one that tries it clear just like this

62
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,860
and I'm going to just go right into the

63
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:54,569
brow now for this first layer I

64
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,159
definitely like to be a very very messy

65
00:01:54,569 --> 00:01:58,319
with my glue application because we are

66
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,299
going to clean it up after and we really

67
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:02,369
wanna make sure every single hair is

68
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:05,640
extremely extremely coated and there is

69
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:07,319
a thick with two fees layer on the brow

70
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,729
notice I'm going against the grain of

71
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:10,349
the hair as well now I'm just gonna grab

72
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:13,260
any old angle brush my brush collection

73
00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:15,680
and I'm going to push very very hard

74
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:18,360
into my forehead and brush all the hairs

75
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,519
upwards in the direction that they grow

76
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,380
in it so we are flattening it to the

77
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:25,769
face and now with that glue again I'm

78
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:26,880
going to press that right down and I

79
00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:28,709
just covering it white white before that

80
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,180
glue dries I'm going to take this and

81
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:32,760
I'm going to go around the edge of the

82
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,410
glue and just wipe off any excess just

83
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,549
because the glue does get kind of

84
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,930
textured on the edges if you're not

85
00:02:35,549 --> 00:02:37,980
super careful and we want this to look

86
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,970
as smooth as possible

87
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:43,109
I think that's all cleaned up I'm just

88
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:44,220
gonna grab my hairdryer on my face this

89
00:02:43,109 --> 00:02:46,200
is the necessary by the way I'm just

90
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:48,600
extremely impatient so this really helps

91
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,910
gonna add a second layer of glue at this

92
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:56,269
time just going in the direction of the

93
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:59,459
hairs try it again more glue or clean up

94
00:02:56,269 --> 00:03:02,180
or blow drying and then one final layer

95
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:02,180
just for safety

96
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,000
another eyebrows pretty much all glued

97
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,620
down if you touch is to be completely

98
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,480
dry and flat to your face you should

99
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,460
feel no texture whatsoever it is very

100
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,470
weird and strange feeling and it looks

101
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:15,180
strange but it's about to be completely

102
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:17,670
covered now I used to use a translucent

103
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,110
powder as the next step but I recently

104
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,340
learned otherwise

105
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:22,230
so instead I'm going to grab a

106
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,850
foundation powder this one happens to be

107
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:25,290
the makeup forever I don't even know I

108
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:27,690
just found this in my set and it's kind

109
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:31,110
of a powder puff and I'm going to use

110
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:32,580
this to cover over this brow first you

111
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:34,230
can use the translucent powder here and

112
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,910
set it just like I did for a very very

113
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:37,140
long time but by setting with a

114
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:38,610
foundation powder first you're basically

115
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,959
just adding one more layer of coverage

116
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:41,550
which why not now I'm gonna grab some of

117
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:44,940
the dragon Beauty color correcting a

118
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:46,290
skin fire something at Makita nobody has

119
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,850
time for these names okay and I'm going

120
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:49,950
to use it this orange color corrector

121
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:52,320
and paint this over top of the brow

122
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:54,330
because my brow hairs are dark brown

123
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:56,340
which have a blue undertone and orange

124
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:58,620
color corrects blue so this will help

125
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,870
make it disappear even more well right

126
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:02,580
I'm also going to color correct my five

127
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:04,920
o'clock shadow region because this area

128
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:06,390
is also gray because believe it or not I

129
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,880
am a man but it's going to very gently

130
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:10,019
tap out to this color corrector

131
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,430
so this is pretty much one brow I'll

132
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:12,720
complete while this one is drying I'm

133
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:14,070
gonna do the other one off camera and

134
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,030
I'll be right back

135
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:16,500
alright you guys said that the brows are

136
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:19,080
all covered it is time for Foundation

137
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:21,780
and brows now donations pretty easy but

138
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:23,130
the brows are by far the hardest part of

139
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:24,419
dog makeup and it seems like they'd be

140
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,800
so simple but if you put them in the

141
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:27,540
wrong place or if they're not even after

142
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,500
we're in the wrong direction it's game

143
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,950
what we're supposed to be super super

144
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,810
careful

145
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:32,460
today I'm first gonna have my Kryolan

146
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:34,320
that TV a paint stick and the shade and

147
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,790
be honestly this color doesn't even

148
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,440
notch me at that well if foundation

149
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:39,090
stick is just so incredibly pigmented

150
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,280
though so I'm going to use this to cover

151
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:42,750
over up my brows and then I'm going to

152
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,520
use another foundation that later on for

153
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,590
the rest of my face so I'm just going to

154
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,890
place on here mine's also ridiculously

155
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:51,510
dry for some stupid reason so instead of

156
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,740
scrubbing this over the top of my brow I

157
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:56,520
don't want to disrupt anything I'm just

158
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:57,960
going to top this on like an idiot that

159
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,100
is the obstacles carrying state every

160
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,440
single time I'm gonna use this to go

161
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,730
over my beard region as well now we're

162
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,680
just going to blend

163
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:06,270
oh and that's I'm just using a attends

164
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,580
foundation brushes at the morphe adam up

165
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:09,870
for 395 some Yuko James for generous

166
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,910
enough and it's also in the James

167
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:13,440
Charles original brush that I normally

168
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,970
use a Beauty Blender for foundation and

169
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,200
I definitely will in a few minutes but

170
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,760
when it comes to it this particular

171
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,110
foundation or just kind of any stick

172
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:22,320
foundations and don't know I like to do

173
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:24,150
any general half they brushed first just

174
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,770
to really like scrub it in there okay so

175
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:27,150
now while the solution is still wet I'm

176
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:29,100
gonna grab an angled powder and just

177
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:30,810
like any brown cream and this happens to

178
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,160
be a contour stick and I'm gonna use

179
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:34,170
this to start sketching out the brows

180
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,340
now you guys know beforehand I used to

181
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:36,960
say everything first and then just draw

182
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:39,270
out the browser powder and then conceal

183
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,860
them after but doing it beforehand is so

184
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:42,390
much better because if you put it in the

185
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,860
wrong place you can easily fix the

186
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:45,630
foundation while it's still wet and it

187
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,460
won't get very very messy so I much

188
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:49,950
prefer doing it this way and I'm just

189
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,970
gonna pull this tail straight outwards I

190
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,140
feel like the one mistake that really

191
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:54,060
gets people all the time when it comes

192
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:56,280
to it drag brows is just putting them

193
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,960
too high unless you're doing a paint

194
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,950
like check see mattel or kimchi where

195
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,960
you're literally trying to give yourself

196
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:01,920
a new phase which I'm all here for it's

197
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,300
good to start your broth on the same

198
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,040
place that it normally does and just

199
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,600
lift it higher because that's gonna give

200
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,430
it that more feminine type of effect

201
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,230
rather than like a weird character

202
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:12,240
character alright that is a really good

203
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:13,680
base I'm gonna do the same thing on the

204
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,850
other side now try to make them even as

205
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,350
you can now that we have the general

206
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:18,390
shape I'm gonna grab the TV paint stick

207
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:19,590
in 0-0 this is just the white one

208
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:21,480
actually I think it's technically

209
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:24,060
off-white and just a flat concealer

210
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:25,740
brush this is the m4 ten and I'm going

211
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:27,300
to clean up the bottom of the brow and

212
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:29,040
give us that shape alright so this is

213
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,090
why doing your eyebrows a first is so

214
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,700
much better because I've literally been

215
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:33,960
doing my brows now for 45 minutes and I

216
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,850
still am really not happy with the way

217
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,290
they're looking I cannot get them even

218
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:38,880
but this will do because we can always

219
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:40,890
fix them a little bit later on I'm just

220
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,900
gonna move on I'm next gonna grab my tv

221
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:44,160
foundation stick once again in white and

222
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:47,070
I'm going to use this and put this right

223
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,320
here in the center of my face down here

224
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:51,420
for highlights and the sides my nose on

225
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,320
the chin and then just right here no

226
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,700
it's kind of on that end I'm just

227
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,560
letting this white into my skin it just

228
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:57,060
like my normal beauty routine as if it

229
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,380
were a concealer this is going to really

230
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,850
help bring attention to the center

231
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,560
points of our face but that same clothes

232
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:03,630
that I used to draw in my brows I'm just

233
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,280
going to sketch in mine

234
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:07,740
contours and I'm just going to blend

235
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,880
this out using a fluffy brush last step

236
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,140
before we get to set this face in place

237
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,879
I'm gonna grab my nose country marks the

238
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:14,279
e62 which is available and

239
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:16,169
the original in mini James Charles brush

240
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:18,029
sets I'm going to use this to Sketch up

241
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:20,789
my nose contour and make myself super

242
00:07:18,029 --> 00:07:22,199
super pinched finally 18 million years

243
00:07:20,789 --> 00:07:23,309
later we're done with our face now you

244
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:24,839
get to set it in place and then

245
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:26,129
basically redo it again with more powder

246
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:27,270
so this should be fairly fine up but now

247
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:28,469
it's pretty much smooth sailing from

248
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:30,659
here on I like to think that only God

249
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:32,699
but also Jesus on this fine day

250
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:34,589
I'm gonna go to the RCM a no color

251
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:36,629
powder and basically just tap the sauce

252
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:38,279
on my bench grab the powder puff and

253
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:39,330
start packing this in now it's time to

254
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:40,949
bring some color back that we literally

255
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:42,179
just covered up using this powder this

256
00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:43,800
is where the drying process takes so

257
00:07:42,179 --> 00:07:45,779
many hours but it's so worth it in the

258
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,159
end I'm gonna grab my dragon a beauty at

259
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:49,469
face palette and I'm gonna start just

260
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:51,419
recontouring up my face first using the

261
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:53,339
shade at femme and I am for oh I brush

262
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:54,929
just following literally the same exact

263
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:56,459
shape that I had made beforehand

264
00:07:54,929 --> 00:07:58,050
actually gonna go and have a 5 to 7

265
00:07:56,459 --> 00:07:59,610
instead I don't have time for this gonna

266
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:01,979
grab a little bit of Serge and uses to

267
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:03,869
really hollow out the lower portion of

268
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:05,279
the cheekbone up being very very gentle

269
00:08:03,869 --> 00:08:06,990
without shaking because it is extremely

270
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:08,879
pigmented now for blush let's put I have

271
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:10,979
an 8 for brush and into the shade be be

272
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,839
a girl in the face pact and use this

273
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:14,189
color video my face a quick spreads of

274
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:15,869
some settings right is because there's

275
00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:16,319
like 18,000 layers of powder at this

276
00:08:15,869 --> 00:08:17,369
point

277
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,899
alright so I'm gonna grab an angled

278
00:08:17,369 --> 00:08:20,309
brush at once again and dipping into at

279
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:22,349
the dark brown shade in the top right

280
00:08:20,309 --> 00:08:23,459
corner of the palette which is an T I'm

281
00:08:22,349 --> 00:08:25,199
gonna use this to start filling in

282
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:29,759
details my brows and then same thing on

283
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:31,259
the other side next to the govern Anna

284
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,909
508 which also comes in the mini brush

285
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:34,829
that I'm gonna grab the shade punched me

286
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:36,630
which is the kind of neutral tone and

287
00:08:34,829 --> 00:08:39,149
brown shade in the palette and I'm going

288
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:43,169
to use this color to blend out the t

289
00:08:39,149 --> 00:08:45,590
inward because Joey it looks actually

290
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:49,990
really good on camera mommy

291
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:52,880
mom leave us alone here Charlotte Oh

292
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:53,960
or just three women obvious did not

293
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,490
stand for the Isetta portion where we

294
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,779
get to actually have a fun of course I'm

295
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:58,820

going to doing a simple rainbow look you

301
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,839
guys have seen me do these paper looks a

302
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,580
lot of times before but it is a rainbow

303
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:11,720
Trog a concept it'll make sense later on

304
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:13,310
so we're kind of kind of like brushed

305
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,140
through this it's just real overall the

306
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:17,360
concepts and shapes I'm gonna first grab

307
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:19,970
be in the bright yellow shade and put it

308
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,290
right in my little inner region we're

309
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:23,000
just gonna start blending it upwards in

310
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:24,950
a circular shape but I'm gonna have an M

311
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,870
for 33 and dip into five one eight and

312
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:28,790
I'm going to blend that right next to be

313
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:30,589
a little bit of a rusted adjust to add

314
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:32,300
some dimension in there I'm modeling my

315
00:09:30,589 --> 00:09:33,770
makeup by the way off of Raven at

316
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,640
legendary dark cream from season two it

317
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,900
should have been the winner but we're

318
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,339
not gonna talk about that today she is

319
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:39,410
like by far the most iconic makeup

320
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:41,150
legend ever and I'm trying to follow

321
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:43,040
like her general I she with a little

322
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:45,589
pencil brush I'm just going to grab a

323
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,450
little bit about 10% off and use this to

324
00:09:45,589 --> 00:09:49,070
shade the very bottom part of this

325
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:50,300
orange like I said we are going to cut

326
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:51,860
this so you won't even see this in a few

327
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,450
seconds but just add a little bit of a

328
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,640
dimension I'm next gonna grab another

329
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:58,010
fluffier brush that I'm four three three

330
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,750
and dip into it skip the bright pink

331
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:01,910
shade and I'm going to use this and I'm

332
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:03,650
going to blend this pink right in here

333
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:05,330
I'm going to pull this color downward

334
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:06,770
but just saying that I normally don't do

335
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:08,089
but I'm gonna kind of actually close off

336
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:10,010
this eye shape a little bit now with an

337
00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:12,200
outlet 506 I'm gonna dip into a little

338
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:14,960
bit love that I'm gonna use that to

339
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:17,030
shade at the bottom portion shade of

340
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,500
this now is just a white liner and some

341
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:20,630
concealer brush I'm going to carve out

342
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,250
my crease starting off in this inner

343
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:23,690
corner okay then I'm gonna set this

344
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,560
liner in place using some more up

345
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,850
flashback

346
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,080
now I'm gonna sketch in my winged liner

347
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,650
this is actually going in a good

348
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,630
direction

349
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:31,370
I am happy I'm gonna use anasazi a black

350
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:33,500
liquid liner just to catch out a nice

351
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:35,360
juicy wing okay so basically I'm gonna

352
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,230
do this with my eye open which is not

353
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,540
really how you're supposed to do with

354
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:40,790
liner ever but I want the winged liner

355
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:41,930
to be above my actual eye lid so

356
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:43,700
therefore basically my entire eyelid

357
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:45,650
it's gonna be black and then it'll look

358
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:47,240
like a normal wing with my eyes open

359
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:48,380
that made sense right now that that

360
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,870
liner join I'm just gonna grab a little

361
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:51,710
bit of a spooky from the palette top off

362
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:53,240
the access and

363
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:55,910
make sure that that black eyeliner is

364
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:57,110
set in place and very very blocked

365
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:59,720
because we don't want it to transfer

366
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:00,980
anywhere on the lower lash line we are

367
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,050
first going to grab a little bit more of

368
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:05,720
that white liner and I'm using just a

369
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:07,940
flat brush and I'm going to fill in my

370
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,620
waterline I'm basically just imagining

371
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:11,390
that there's a straight line like if I

372
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:13,400
look forward from like the corner of my

373
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:15,320
eye ball just like outwards so I'm gonna

374
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,580
throw all that end with white and this

375
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,890
is definitely gonna take me looking

376
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:20,840
closely in the mirror because this is it

377
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:25,220
an illusion since my face is not

378
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:27,560
straight across my mini palette mirror

379
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:29,150
Lois it's great for glamming on the go

380
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,650
now with another Emma five-foot-eight

381
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:32,630
brush I'm going to draw a little bit of

382
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:35,000
Cola first and then I'm gonna put coal

383
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:37,100
up right in the middle of my lash line

384
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,510
right up against the actual

385
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,070
lash line and then like I said I'm

386
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:42,230
agitating there's a straight line at so

387
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:43,970
I'm pulling that forward just like this

388
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:45,560
okay then with that same exact brush

389
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:47,450
down finally I'm gonna grab a little bit

390
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:49,460
of a single and escape and I'm just

391
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:50,930
going to pull this purple color out just

392
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:52,580
like this so see how that creates out

393
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:53,450
like a straight line shape that's what

394
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,500
we want and then with that same brush

395
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:56,750
again just covering a little bit of

396
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,370
social blade and a completing dot line

397
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:00,200
in the front now I'm just blending out

398
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:02,600
the line with a fluffier brush this one

399
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:04,250
is the e30 is six a little bit of a

400
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,110
playground okay you guys I have done

401
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:07,400
Drive makeup literally so many turns out

402
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:09,620
and is not even funny and I've been

403
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,570
trying to emulate Ravens like aura and

404
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:13,130
just shapes of makeup since I literally

405
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:16,400
started doing it in fact my first choice

406
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:18,170
look ever three years ago was a raven

407
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,160
luck it was the worst I makeup I've ever

408
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,780
done in my entire life

409
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,100
but I think this is the first thing that

410
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,910
I've ever actually successfully gotten

411
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,220
at the shape

412
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:25,940
I feel like this looks so bomb I am so

413
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,860
excited right now

414
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:29,180
and it wasn't that hard either but what

415
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:30,560
made me hard is getting even on the

416
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,880
other side at which I'm gonna go do off

417
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,300
camera right now and then I'll be right

418
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,770
back

419
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,630
to pop on the wash and finish up the

420
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:37,430
rest of the look we're back the bolt

421
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:39,680
eyes are now complete and somehow very

422
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:41,540
symmetrical it is a blast day here the

423
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,550
sister studio and I'm about to apply

424
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:45,260
some lash as a person was gonna play a

425
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:47,150
late coat of mascara today I'm gonna use

426
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:48,140
the Lily lashes of triple x mascara

427
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:49,550
because it has been up my favorite

428
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:51,290
recently okay and then I'm gonna

429
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:53,750
carefully also apply out some mascara on

430
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:55,089
my lower lashes but I'm going to skip

431
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:57,100
out on the lashes

432
00:12:55,089 --> 00:12:58,360
my inner corners and also losses on my

433
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,980
outer corners because I want those to

434
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,749
remain in a white to keep that lytic

435
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:03,370
spatial illusion going for lashes I'm

436
00:13:01,749 --> 00:13:04,809
just gonna pop on a typical 301 that

437
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:06,819
drag lash but for once I'm not gonna

438
00:13:04,809 --> 00:13:08,499
stack it I just want to do it one lash

439
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:10,809
I'm not sure why this is like brave of

440
00:13:08,499 --> 00:13:12,009
me to even attempt this bats be good

441
00:13:10,809 --> 00:13:13,749
alright you guys so those are both of

442
00:13:12,009 --> 00:13:15,069
the eyes all complete and it is now the

443
00:13:13,749 --> 00:13:16,389
home strats are gonna move on to the

444
00:13:15,069 --> 00:13:17,230
rest of the face and the next step we

445
00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:19,660
have is going to be of course

446
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:21,670
highlighting so I'm moving my face a

447
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:23,199

00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:25,660
set setting spray to Sprint's them at

449
00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:27,939
Moisture about and I'm gonna grab hey

450
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:29,709
I'm at 5:04 under a little bit of a face

451
00:13:27,939 --> 00:13:30,850
from the palette maybe a little bit of

452
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:33,939
ring light to honestly why not I just

453
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:35,620
put this right on the cheekbone a little

454
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:38,079
bit on the forehead for a little bit of

455
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:40,149
an extra blow that some right down the

456
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,129
tip of the nose next under grab a little

457
00:13:40,149 --> 00:13:44,259
bit of literally it which is my a peachy

458
00:13:42,129 --> 00:13:46,300
blush shade from the palette I'm gonna

459
00:13:44,259 --> 00:13:48,249
use this to blend together my highlight

460
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,930
and my blush now I'm going to clean up

461
00:13:48,249 --> 00:13:51,309
my lips and oh my God we're like

462
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:53,630

463
00:13:51,309 --> 00:13:56,940
fill in a nude lip like always

464
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:58,930
[Music]

465
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:00,160
okay you guys this look is pretty much

466
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:01,630
about complete at this point I'm going

467
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,730
to give these a nice sprint of the Urban

468
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:05,560
Decay all nighter setting spray to lock

469
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:07,210
everything in and then the mini palette

470
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,680
also serves as a fan because I cannot

471
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:09,640
find my sister's been anywhere so all

472
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,590

portion of this look all complete I am

474
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:14,740
so happy how this turned out I think

475
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,720
this is the first time that I really got

476
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:18,910
in like my drive face and all the shapes

477
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,230
and angles really really good and I am

478
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:21,310
super super proud of myself and I hope

479
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:22,780
that you guys learned a little bit as

480
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:24,820

481
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:26,680
first time for me to even get everything

out to my stylist Joey Tao for selling

me in this gown and Michelle Herbert for

498
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:53,950
creating it she literally made the

499
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:55,780
entire bodice one by one with broken

500
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:56,980
pieces of mirror which is so so

501
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:58,570
beautiful and the bottom is all hand

502
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,920
painted she literally killed it and also

503
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:02,020
thank you to my good friend James for

504
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,510
making this custom little paint dripped

505
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:05,440
wig I think this looks so so so cute and

506
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:06,970
I really hope that you guys enjoyed this

507
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,860
video and picked up a few new tips and

508
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:09,880
tricks I'm running so late for my

509
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,230
Halloween party right now so I really

510
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,150
gotta go but thank you guys so much for

511
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:15,580
watching hello you guys a good morning I

512
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:16,870
look like hit by a bus currently we did

513
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:18,970
not be at home last night and talking

514
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:20,020
about 6:00 in the morning Halloween it's

515
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:22,120
like the one time of the year that I

516
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:23,860
will actually go out and party and it

517
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,000
was lit not gonna lie

518
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:26,890
just watching back the footage from

519
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,750
filming last night and I still a home

520
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:30,370
look turned out but I was running an

521
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:32,350
hour and a half late for my party and I

522
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:34,630
realized that I did not really explain

523
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:35,950
my look what I know if the mini palette

524
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:37,840
pretty much every drag queen friend that

525
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:39,460
I've ever met texted me so that they

526
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,840
needed it immediately because it would

527
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:43,540
make getting ready in the backstage area

528
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:45,130
so much easier that is why the dress is

529
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:46,480
black in both the dress and the wig are

530
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:47,800
splutter painted with different colors

531
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,150
from the palette and that is why the top

532
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,980
of the bodice is made completely out of

533
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:52,600
broken shards of mirror and honor of the

534
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:54,250
palette not having a mirror at first

535
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,410
glance I'm not realizing it may not be

536
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:57,400
at that obvious but I'm really proud of

537
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:59,170
have the look turned out and I'm really

538
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:01,270
grateful to the designers who work super

539
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:03,190
hard I think it looked so beautiful so

540
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:05,110
that is what the concept was and I hope

541
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:06,250
you guys enjoyed this transformation if

542
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:07,660
you did enjoy please don't forget to
