00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:09,719
hi sisters James Charles here welcome

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:10,980
back to my youtube channel so today I

3
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:12,210
thought I would sit down and talk to you

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,679
about saying that has been a very very

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,000
controversial and why did they talk

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,220
about topic right now the makeup

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,470
community and just in like the community

8
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,570
I guess in general and that is editing

9
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,010
and retouching photos for some reason

10
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,539
lightly photoshopping and sitting has

11
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,460
been a very very controversial topic on

12
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:28,439
social media but having a little bit of

13
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,060
a news flash for you guys almost every

14
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:32,520
single influence or celebrity that you

15
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:36,239
see posting a photo has probably faced

16
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,649
to again I don't know I recently people

17
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,940
have been getting so surprised and

18
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:40,079
called out for because this is much time

19
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,969
in this moment since literally the

20
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,559
beginning of time everybody edits the

21
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:45,059
photos the I guarantee probably how

22
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:47,039
about you watching a lot of bases itself

23
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:49,289
on your photos well it's definitely one

24
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,610
of my all-time favorite used apps today

25
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:52,170
I wanted to sit down with you guys and

26
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,190
show you the process trauma taking the

27
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,440
photo to actually posting other

28
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:56,789
Instagram everything in between for some

29
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,989
reason a lot of people everything type

30
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:59,910
all day and certain plugins out of my

31
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:02,039
assets and it all to make the pod which

32
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:03,149
is so proud of the truth often times if

33
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:04,799
you guys we have the satellite post

34
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:06,720
completely block and none of the photos

35
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,490
on there because unfortunately you can't

36
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,659
have that balance now I wish you could

37
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,490
but yeah

38
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:12,930
really can't - this stuff I have never

39
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,580
once owned a hype enemy in the first

40
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,259
place I only talk about face sitting in

41
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,700
Photoshop all the time and Here I am

42
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:19,619
right now making their tutorial free

43
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,570
various than give away all my hints so

44
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:24,240
that being said if you want to see how I

45
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:25,880
took my selfies from drab to fab just

46
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,020
make sure you keep on watching

47
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,310
alright everybody welcome to a home

48
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,200
screen this is my kind of one to seven

49
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,119
plus this is where I take all my photos

50
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,590
Andy : editing I used to use Photoshop a

51
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,180
long time ago but now I keep it just on

52
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,479
my phone it makes it a lot easier and a

53
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,729
lot quicker

54
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:40,990
I go from start to finish now the first

55
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:43,360
time that I hope it is going to be

56
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:44,829
obviously snapchat hello - this is real

57
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,289
this is me and the starkly public my

58
00:01:44,829 --> 00:01:50,200
front camera now I never take actual

59
00:01:47,289 --> 00:01:52,509
photos with my camera I always use

60
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,759
snapped up to take my selfies the camera

61
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:57,250
on here is so good it doesn't appear

62
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:58,600
your images and it kind of like blurs up

63
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,009
the skin and just puts a really soft

64
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,689
feel sort of everything making the

65
00:02:00,009 --> 00:02:03,969
photos super super high quality but also

66
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:06,610
almost like self retouched if that makes

67
00:02:03,969 --> 00:02:07,689
any sense once I take my photos I was

68
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:10,179
just save them and then I'll go through

69
00:02:07,689 --> 00:02:11,380
of my favourites which are right up in

70
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:13,599
here and I think the ones I like the

71
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:15,430
best so for today's video I decided to

72
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,079
pieces to this photo right here that I

73
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:19,269
took this morning the same one that I

74
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:21,610
have on right now it is currently like

75
00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:21,940
this is 4 o'clock so it is now 5 hours

76
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:24,340
later

77
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:26,590
obviously warp down just a little bit

78
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,790
but this is right after was fresh so

79
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,959
this was taking writing from my window

80
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:30,160
out there in my apartment

81
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,140
and ready to be editing this photo today

82
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,510
for the grab and for the purposes of

83
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:35,739
this video I do have talked about one

84
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:37,720
quick thing before I actually start

85
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:39,760
editing and that is how watching out of

86
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,620
my photos as an artist I like to look at

87
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,030
my Instagram is kind of my portfolio so

88
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:45,190
they don't want to put out the best work

89
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:46,510
possible for all of you guys to see when

90
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,950
I do have my photos that always change

91
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:49,540
things that are already there you will

92
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:51,579
never ever see me actually editing on a

93
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,450
makeup that includes like editing on any

94
00:02:51,579 --> 00:02:54,069
imperfections

95
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:55,450
smoothing out skin brightening up the

96
00:02:54,069 --> 00:02:57,069
eyes and the highlights if it was lost

97
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,549
lighting and just stuff of that basic

98
00:02:57,069 --> 00:02:59,470
nature

99
00:02:57,549 --> 00:03:00,940
basic things that can't be fixed with

100
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:03,250
makeup that have to be fix with either

101
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:05,319
lighting or plastic surgery to things

102
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,940
that are kind of out of my control

103
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:08,920
that being said just in case anybody

104
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,630
wants to call me up for Ally I did take

105
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,489
a video this morning of this look and

106
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:14,829
this is what I looked like this is once

107
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:17,530
again brought from snapchat on filter

108
00:03:14,829 --> 00:03:20,109
unedited this is my makeup I looked

109
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:22,060
pretty decent I liked it a lot today and

110
00:03:20,109 --> 00:03:24,220
yeah you can't edit this it's right over

111
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:26,139
Santa so yeah I'm going to be editing

112
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:28,030
this picture today just to enhance it a

113
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:29,769
little bit but keeping in mind what it

114
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:31,480
actually looks like this morning what

115
00:03:29,769 --> 00:03:32,650
you just saw in that minute know what

116
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,299
I'm doing the first half that I always

117
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:36,160
happen to is facetune

118
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:37,510
now this happens the $4.99 in the App

119
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,599
Store which is a lot more expensive than

120
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:41,700
other apps no this video

121
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,920
although and truly really immersive what

122
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,480
face - please we're gonna hit me up I'm

123
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,250
gonna try to make this icon up here go

124
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,260
on to open photo then put a favorites

125
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:51,000
and just pick this photo right here now

126
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,140
overall like I said before this is a

127
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,430
pretty good photo so I'm just gonna go

128
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,349
in and really really lightly do some

129
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:57,299
retouching and the first two avenues is

130
00:03:55,349 --> 00:03:58,409
Rishi if you know a lot about angles you

131
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:00,180
can topple this photo was taken from

132
00:03:58,409 --> 00:04:02,730
being low angle rather than a straight

133
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,870
hot angle or a very very high I usually

134
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:05,939
take photo shil this angle because it

135
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:07,109
allows for most of my eyelid space to be

136
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:09,659
shown because I have very very heavy

137
00:04:07,109 --> 00:04:10,980
eyes boy in turn this makes my eyebrows

138
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:12,959
look too small are my lips look a little

139
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:15,629
bit smaller and my jawline to not be as

140
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,709
puppet and my forehead to look huge so

141
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:18,150
these are just basic things that I like

142
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:20,699
to retouch with this make sure they look

143
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:21,900
as good and natural as possible first

144
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:23,550
we're gonna do this photo a is I'm going

145
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:26,310
to zoom in and I'm just going to make my

146
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:27,930
jawline super duper poppin unfortunately

147
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:29,009
I cannot afford plastic surgery and I

148
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:31,380
also legally cannot get positive

149
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:32,930
surgeons longer age so this is the next

150
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,740
best thing that we got up in here I

151
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:35,910
really really like the way this looks

152
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,440
just because who doesn't love the really

153
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:38,970
good strong jawline I think it is one of

154
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,050
the hottest features on a guy going out

155
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,669
to the other side I'm not really going

156
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:43,410
to do anything here just because my

157
00:04:41,669 --> 00:04:45,479
jawline lines up with the corner out

158
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:46,680
this wall and if I move it around it's

159
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:48,419
gonna look very very disordered and

160
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,310
we're so not trying to get called out

161
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:51,960
for editing today you want this to look

162
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:53,610
as natural as possible believe it or not

163
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,409
the next thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna

164
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:57,270
go to the details tool this tool

165
00:04:55,409 --> 00:04:59,340
basically adds contrast and sharpness to

166
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:00,810
photo wherever you draw on but I think

167
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,610
this really does make such a difference

168
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:03,630
I don't think the topic on my eyes it's

169
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,949
just an eyelash the straight to a

170
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:07,110
balloon when you stand out on the face

171
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:10,530
of it flirty and big same thing with the

172
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:11,490
inner brow hairs usually I'll do

173
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:12,659
anything else but because they're a

174
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,789
little bit prone out I'm not gonna bring

175
00:05:12,659 --> 00:05:16,199
any more attention to them a little bit

176
00:05:14,789 --> 00:05:18,630
on the fake freckles just tell me and

177
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:19,550
and then also on my Cartier ring because

178
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:22,300
they were tearing

179
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:24,440
and people to know that it's there and

180
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,970
that's pretty much all the decently I'm

181
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,139
gonna do I really don't wanna bring a

182
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:29,210
lot of other attended to the rest of the

183
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:31,190
faith so much I want to save it my

184
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:32,900
progress like I said getting before

185
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:34,069
after that leaders that I'm not much but

186
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,300
I think it really is just a little

187
00:05:34,069 --> 00:05:38,240
things that make this little great in

188
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:39,470
the end the next one I'm going to use is

189
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,879
going to lead the smooth tool and this

190
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:42,229
is one that really needs to be careful

191
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:44,060
because it truly kind of make a bring

192
00:05:42,229 --> 00:05:45,949
your throws a lot of you can turn turn

193
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,720
out smoother and just scrub their photos

194
00:05:45,949 --> 00:05:49,729
which i think looks absolutely awful is

195
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,930
so big lurking and is obviously not

196
00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:53,330
actual and people are going to know you

197
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:55,370
edited it it's definitely not a look I

198
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:57,470
actually tend to liberate never infuse

199
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:59,569
smoother like ways when you smooth and

200
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:01,580
just build up the opacity I really need

201
00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:02,780
to so when I go with this tool the first

202
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,819
thing I do is I'll go in and I'll just

203
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,900
floor with any pores for the most part

204
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:06,830
setting as actually having a pretty good

205
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,360
it's game day so I'm just going to

206
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:10,159
lightly tap over areas that you touch

207
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:13,550
her which is kind of like in between the

208
00:06:10,159 --> 00:06:15,199
brows on the nose region and then this

209
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:17,629
smile line that I always get right here

210
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,069
I always just smooth it out I'm gonna

211
00:06:17,629 --> 00:06:20,360
let me talk about my beard area as well

212
00:06:19,069 --> 00:06:27,229
because I didn't shake City because I

213
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:28,490
was lazy and yeah to the shop in this

214
00:06:27,229 --> 00:06:30,770
room to have when I really lightly go

215
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:32,719
over the lips I hate the way my lips

216
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:34,940
have a lot of texture and light they are

217
00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:36,319
very very crusty I don't know why I'm

218
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,580
going to use every lip treatment on the

219
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,349
planet and for somebody's may still have

220
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:41,029
crusty and dusty especially when I'm

221
00:06:39,349 --> 00:06:42,889
wearing cloth so I just moved about to

222
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:44,300
get a little more natural look as well

223
00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:45,680
I'd like to over line my lips with them

224
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,509
a little bigger so I want them to look

225
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,830
as real as possible now that I remember

226
00:06:47,509 --> 00:06:50,539
smoothing I'm going to move my all-time

227
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:53,150
favorites tool and that is with tones

228
00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:54,440
this tool is like my hidden secret not a

229
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:57,229
lot of you will know how to use it but I

230
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:59,630
am a freaking queen of tones I love it

231
00:06:57,229 --> 00:07:01,290
truly can make your photos so frickin

232
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:03,090
good if you use it correctly and

233
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:04,350
so the first thing that I do on this

234
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:06,030
whole situation the highlights are very

235
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:07,800
very empowered now I was standing in

236
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:09,540
front of a very very large window

237
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,100
hitting after sunlight so you can see

238
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:13,260
most of the highlights is mr. company I

239
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:15,630
know is / very very bright but there's

240
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:17,520
no way any of the sides my face or from

241
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:19,080
downwards because I hold the thumb

242
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,790
downwards so I'm just going to do a

243
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,990
little bit of tones to fix I'm I think

244
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:24,420
up and make sure all the highlights are

245
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:25,860
even and lighting so it's like the

246
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:27,600
caliph Uthman actually gonna use a color

247
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,490
that's already pre-selected and I'm just

248
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,980
gonna bring it up to the top I'm gonna

249
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:33,270
go almost to white but not quite I want

250
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:35,850
to make sure it's not start player also

251
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:36,360
just literally fake and to like it just

252
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:38,340
doesn't look right

253
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,080
basically so just gonna pick this clip

254
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:42,120
I'm gonna tell us that I'd like to do

255
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,620
right on in and I'm still starting by

256
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,930
tapping a little bit hotter than tip it

257
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:47,880
knows I'm also going to put a little bit

258
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:49,020
more right up in here basically when I

259
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,370
do this I'm gonna go my phone like this

260
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,080
so you can see but I like to really just

261
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:53,790
lightly tap on my phone

262
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,960
I never was up there that's from bears

263
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:56,820
just gonna look really really stupid

264
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,260
like this which is obviously not the

265
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:00,780
look we're going for it looks extremely

266
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:02,730
wrong so I'm just gonna grab the eraser

267
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:05,310
to erase over that but yeah they took

268
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:06,330
really just lightly tap it and just make

269
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:08,040
sure I'm getting it really really light

270
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:09,510
and even effect and then if anything

271
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,020
looks too intense I don't really how

272
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:11,400
that looks

273
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:14,280
I'm just gonna down erased and just

274
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:16,080
lightly talked about already and there

275
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:18,240
we go looks pretty good this has really

276
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,740
been some surveys out that so I never

277
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,420
had a little bit of highlight under the

278
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:23,160
cheekbone region now if you look right

279
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:24,360
here you can see what the texture is am

280
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,010
actual highlighter

281
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,110
now the link is not going to be from the

282
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:29,430
sides that need from a straight line and

283
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:31,140
because they were very very able to face

284
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:32,340
the highlight is not reflecting

285
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,690
I'm gonna lightly tell them a little bit

286
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:35,790
of highway right here just make sure to

287
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:36,960
shine with obviously that looks awful it

288
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:39,150
was going to type over elbows together

289
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,290
just kind of fun to animate the book as

290
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:42,150
much as possible

291
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:44,040
and there we go that looks a little bit

292
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:45,240
better just a little bit with Ivan just

293
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,779
let me know that it's there but it's

294
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,720
certainly not blindingly no

295
00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:51,579
but that is a okay now the next I'm

296
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,689
going to do in tone is the eyes and this

297
00:08:51,579 --> 00:08:54,730
is saying that a lot of you will talk

298
00:08:52,689 --> 00:08:56,649
about they either love it or hate it

299
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:57,970
I clearly love it because I continue to

300
00:08:56,649 --> 00:08:59,829
do it and it's a trick that I absolutely

301
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:02,230
love and then it's brightening out with

302
00:08:59,829 --> 00:09:03,339
the eyes I'm gonna go back into tones

303
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:05,529
and this time I'm just gonna go all the

304
00:09:03,339 --> 00:09:07,480
way up to stark white all the way at the

305
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:10,089
inner corner I know if you are deities

306
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:12,399
that I later can't now you can use your

307
00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:13,480
light so I'm just gonna kinda I'm going

308
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,040
to lightly golden tones I'm going to

309
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,329
zoom all the way in and I'm just gonna

310
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,860
start lightly tapping off of the way to

311
00:09:16,329 --> 00:09:19,449
be high just to make them a little

312
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,920
bright and then when it comes to the

313
00:09:19,449 --> 00:09:23,019
actual pupil this is my all-time

314
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,730
favorite trick I'm gonna let the top in

315
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:26,499
the white on the peoples of the eye

316
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:29,709
and this really brighten up and makes

317
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:31,360
them look so freakin pretty oh my god

318
00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:33,790
see how good that looks it just looks so

319
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,809
like dollar lightly almost a cartoon

320
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:36,550
character but it looks like it can

321
00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:38,740
actually be natural which is why I

322
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:40,509
freaking love unfortunately my eyes are

323
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:42,790
a round so I always wear my

324
00:09:40,509 --> 00:09:44,949
contacts anyway they are Desio in the

325
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:46,420
color creamy beige they're like all 10

326
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:47,559
viewers they are so freaking beautiful

327
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,779
that they do look good with the

328
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:51,370
collection and flash why when it comes

329
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:52,269
to like a photography it's really really

330
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:53,860
hard adjusting when you're wearing

331
00:09:52,269 --> 00:09:55,870
really fluttery lashes because they

332
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,639
create shadows so I might just add a

333
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:59,199
little bit more brightness of the eyes

334
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:00,850
that I do that by the choppers

335
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:02,680
so I just tried a little bit of a V and

336
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,970
I wasn't sure the the top part because I

337
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,709
don't wanna get rid of any little

338
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:07,420
shadows because I'm a little really big

339
00:10:05,709 --> 00:10:08,769
so it's gonna out of that white then go

340
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:12,339
back into the race and just make sure it

341
00:10:08,769 --> 00:10:13,629
looks pretty good right as well the last

342
00:10:12,339 --> 00:10:15,699
and final step for this photo is going

343
00:10:13,629 --> 00:10:16,990
to be to work on it the nose contour now

344
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:18,670
this is something that has sparked many

345
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:20,529
the controversy in the past with my

346
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:22,089
followers people either love my nose

347
00:10:20,529 --> 00:10:24,490
contour or hate my nose contour I

348
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:26,079
personally love a good snot nose like I

349
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:27,819
said before I am NOT someone who hides

350
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,559
kind of a very very open about her knee

351
00:10:27,819 --> 00:10:32,529
and might notice one of the most evident

352
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:33,879
Davis I talked on my channel many times

353
00:10:32,529 --> 00:10:35,019
about my nose contouring how it's

354
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:36,459
something that I struggle with the

355
00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:37,929
balance and I'm not very good at but I'm

356
00:10:36,459 --> 00:10:40,389
learning and as you can see in this

357
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:42,100
photo it's honestly not that bad it does

358
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:44,319
look pretty stuff so we can if I can say

359
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:46,329
for myself I do really count looks like

360
00:10:44,319 --> 00:10:47,379
I said I would post this but I want to

361
00:10:46,329 --> 00:10:49,509
edit it to make it look even better

362
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:51,399
because why the hell not

363
00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:53,170
to do this I'm going to take the tone so

364
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:54,670
I'm going to grab the paper tool and I'm

365
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:55,809
actually going to zoom in to it and she

366
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:57,970
cannot go around with the lightest shade

367
00:10:55,809 --> 00:10:59,589
right up in here so I'm going to lightly

368
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:01,540
top it in that color all the time in the

369
00:10:59,589 --> 00:11:02,949
nose I must get rid of the shadows I

370
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:04,779
also love this tool because when you do

371
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:05,889
this it keeps the freckles on the

372
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:07,779
texture they are they've just changed

373
00:11:05,889 --> 00:11:09,399
the under color I'm not really sure how

374
00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:11,529
it works but it really truly does wonder

375
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:12,910
so just why I absolutely love this trick

376
00:11:11,529 --> 00:11:15,730
is like my secret to getting the

377
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:17,290
all-time best to smash nose and there we

378
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:19,750
go that is the before and after of the

379
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:21,189
signature James Charles dose match and

380
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,720
it's by far the most interesting about

381
00:11:21,189 --> 00:11:25,540
me but I'm not gonna hide it I have a

382
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,040
very very big secret I do really like

383
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:28,689
the way this looks though on my photos

384
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,639
my nose the thing that I was insecure

385
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:31,990
about so if I didn't depend on it if you

386
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:33,129
know why I had a nose like this don't

387
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,579
 do it it's really not that

388
00:11:33,129 --> 00:11:35,110
serious

389
00:11:33,579 --> 00:11:36,309
this is just the techniques that I like

390
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:38,679
to do and just to show you guys in this

391
00:11:36,309 --> 00:11:40,029
box of how do you fake so now that the

392
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:41,649
nose is done this is my face basically

393
00:11:40,029 --> 00:11:43,029
complete I don't know as you can see

394
00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:44,889
it's really not that different

395
00:11:43,029 --> 00:11:46,029
the pictures look pretty similar I just

396
00:11:44,889 --> 00:11:48,370
made a little bit sharper a little

397
00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:49,629
greater awareness lot cleaner but

398
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:51,100
there's one more thing I like to do I'm

399
00:11:49,629 --> 00:11:52,779
a student when we go on the personal

400
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,579
photo if you wanted to be between this

401
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:55,959
out here everything we're gonna do from

402
00:11:54,579 --> 00:11:58,089
now on for so the video is basically

403
00:11:55,959 --> 00:11:59,410
just filter it and color stuff so this

404
00:11:58,089 --> 00:12:01,059
photo could be coming done you could

405
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:02,769
post this item post is on my Twitter or

406
00:12:01,059 --> 00:12:03,279
something but for Instagram because I

407
00:12:02,769 --> 00:12:05,139
haven't

408
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,370
decent feet I'm going to whiten the

409
00:12:05,139 --> 00:12:08,259
photo and display the colors a little

410
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:09,370
bit so the last thing I'm going to do my

411
00:12:08,259 --> 00:12:11,170
facing that's going to it the white

412
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:12,670
until over here and this is the one step

413
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:15,220
where I will actually not remind us to

414
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:17,019
use your finger and go ham with it

415
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:18,730
scrubbing I really when I'm using this

416
00:12:17,019 --> 00:12:20,139
tool I like to go absolutely ham just

417
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:21,970
right off the entire image because like

418
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:23,470
I said we have a erase so this goal will

419
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:25,209
work in a second and zoom in and make

420
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:26,740
sure everything is very clean and for

421
00:12:25,209 --> 00:12:28,449
the most part I think we are done with

422
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:30,879
face daily total spending on the check

423
00:12:28,449 --> 00:12:32,529
back save it save it to camera and there

424
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:34,749
we are all set to move on with the next

425
00:12:32,529 --> 00:12:36,939
step so for based in the next stop that

426
00:12:34,749 --> 00:12:38,680
I rather to use this vsco cam now music

427
00:12:36,939 --> 00:12:40,120
filters to self assembly for you

428
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,620
I personally don't like filters how they

429
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,360
should fit the raw image and then just

430
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:44,980
play with the colors a little bit so I'm

431
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,089
just gonna use notes okay for that I'm

432
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:47,019
not gonna have a filter which didn't

433
00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:49,029
start the little thing in the bottom

434
00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:50,439
corner like this body then I'm gonna go

435
00:12:49,029 --> 00:12:53,949
over to this tool right here which is

436
00:12:50,439 --> 00:12:55,930
called skin tone I personally hate but I

437
00:12:53,949 --> 00:12:57,819
look either to yellow or too big in

438
00:12:55,930 --> 00:13:00,160
photos it is one of my biggest pet

439
00:12:57,819 --> 00:13:01,720
peeves I don't know why I like to look

440
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,790
as neutral as possible and in this

441
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,529
little faint looking way too yellow

442
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:09,910
so take this fight I'm gonna drag it

443
00:13:05,529 --> 00:13:12,009
down probably to around around like 3.5

444
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:13,180
looks nice in neutral

445
00:13:12,009 --> 00:13:15,399
I'm not really sure how this is gonna

446
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:17,110
read on the actual video recording above

447
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:18,699
my phone this is looking for a very

448
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:20,050
neutral very very late right in the

449
00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:21,220
middle of pink and yellow so I'm just

450
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,059
gonna go ahead and sing that up right

451
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,800
there

452
00:13:22,059 --> 00:13:24,580
for some reason this really bothered me

453
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,040
I always

454
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:28,420
this but I hate when my skin tone does

455
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,190
not look the same across all my pictures

456
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:32,560
so this is one set there's absolutely

457
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:33,880
vital to our process now the only other

458
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,860
thing is that makes your hand vscocam

459
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:37,029
basically the boat is done so now I'm

460
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,589
gonna open up the hips you're not gonna

461
00:13:37,029 --> 00:13:40,180
get ready to post so it's gonna

462
00:13:38,589 --> 00:13:41,529
obviously open up I can't go to this

463
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:43,450
photo that I'm just going to adjust it

464
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:44,890
to however to be I like doing the

465
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:47,170
brightness way up so I'm hoping that to

466
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:50,200
around 7 the contrast I'll boost as well

467
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:52,390
as probably around some of the guys walk

468
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:54,130
the way straight way down reservists I

469
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:55,329
really like the look of cool Toma photos

470
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:59,200
so I usually bring my work down to

471
00:13:55,329 --> 00:14:00,880
around 15 or 18 I guess whatever not

472
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,350
that serious and all over the saturation

473
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,149
top as well because sometimes the ones

474
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:05,350
can really build out the photos that I

475
00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:07,779
wanna make sure the vibrancy is still

476
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:09,070
there it just looks more cool toned the

477
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:10,240
next thing I do is go into this column

478
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:12,010
tab and like I said how they're going to

479
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,350
look really cool tone so I'm just going

480
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:16,680
to pick shadows go over to the blue and

481
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:19,660
then bring this down to probably around

482
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,740
15% I'm going to highlight that for this

483
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:23,140
photo I'm going to boost him up a little

484
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:24,610
bit happy turn around 10 and I was like

485
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:27,040
to play my shadows down just got a

486
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:28,630
little bit more contrast and my last and

487
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,430
final step is just to shorten the photo

488
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:32,350
this is like the one thing that I love

489
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:34,000
to do and sometimes when you take snap

490
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:36,220
selfies like I said it makes the quality

491
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,360
super super good and super smooth but we

492
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,950
sometimes do looks a little bit of that

493
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,870
detail and sharpness so I really just

494
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:43,149
run with the crap any pictures for this

495
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:45,010
one I'm only gonna set of the round help

496
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:46,209
me around with 30 just to be safe and

497
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:48,310
that is the completed photo with that I

498
00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:51,520
would go next write whatever caption a

499
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:53,410
lot and then click Share all right guys

500
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:55,420
and now stick pleated face tube tutorial

501
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:59,860
just for overall reference we went from

502
00:14:55,420 --> 00:15:01,779
this to this like I said before I do

503
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:03,310
consider myself an artist and for me and

504
00:15:01,779 --> 00:15:04,600
my Instagram was like my portfolio so

505
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:06,430
I'd like to put out the best quality

506
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,199
photos as possible and that definitely

507
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:09,910
includes editing almost every single

508
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:11,709
photo posted by inputs or an online

509
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:13,630
celebrity has been edited and that's

510
00:15:11,709 --> 00:15:15,010
just the cold hard truth it's something

511
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:16,449
to be embarrassed huh and tussling to

512
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:18,670
call people help for in a something to

513
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:20,529
yell either for the most of us it's just

514
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:21,010
to fix them imperfections but obviously

515
00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:23,050
people

516
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:25,420
go crazy but it's not fair to judge all

517
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:26,440
of us on the people who go and do the

518
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,730
