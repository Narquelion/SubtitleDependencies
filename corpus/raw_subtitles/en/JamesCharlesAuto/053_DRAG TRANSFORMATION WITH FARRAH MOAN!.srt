22
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:57,539
just went ahead and be covered by a

23
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:59,190
brows and sideburns off camera a very

24
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:01,739
very lengthy process for like all drag

25
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,090
queens mascara whereas her shaved off so

26
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:04,470
first things first we're actually gonna

27
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,750
color correct the brows and the

28
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,939
sideburns is it actually the cover FX in

shave this morning I might be right back

32
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,490
I think to always see where I hate

33
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:20,460
before it when I wake up all because

34
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:25,770
mine is notorious for run straight

35
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:27,090
through makeup will wear - since we're

36
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,250
covering its brows were actually don't

37
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,479
want to really like high coverage

38
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:32,440

really light foundation for this just

46
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,990
because it's the only penalty it means

47
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:49,299
that I have we needed that full coverage

48
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:50,970

you guys watching this now will have

59
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,360

60
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:25,209

61
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:28,209
tan and we have this Melanie Mills of

62
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:30,940
Hollywood Colima body stuff oh my god my

63
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:32,980
mind is very vague like radiating from

64
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:35,110
my family it's so beautiful it's like a

65
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:36,100
bronze guys so that is why my foundation

66
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:38,739
is a little bit darker to say these days

67
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:40,360
open up my face so I don't any comments

68
00:02:38,739 --> 00:02:42,040
about it about take the face to the neck

69
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,239
like you're supposed to there anything

70
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:48,480
there so X are what we're going to go

71
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:48,480
into another foundation we're so crazy

72
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:54,310
you know there's some people that mix

73
00:02:51,579 --> 00:03:00,579
like three or four foundations like good

74
00:02:54,310 --> 00:03:02,920
luck I've never made some Asia this is

75
00:03:00,579 --> 00:03:05,230
the Marc Jacobs remarkable it's no more

76
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,209
what if it covers a function like no

77
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:08,980
one's business I think that's actually

78
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:10,299
enough to cover the whole entire face if

79
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:16,959
your games I made it in the light

80
00:03:10,299 --> 00:03:21,780
coverage like up straight is a model of

81
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,780
the brows well yeah

82
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,650
[Music]

83
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,570
everybody actually mixed a little

84
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:33,480
mixture of like midnight powers

85
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:35,790
my treat banana powder and then some

86
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,230
Laura Mercier powder a little bit of

87
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:39,240
like white powder and a little bit of

88
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:42,930
chestnut powers to kind of like a little

89
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:44,790
bit some colors yeah that's a trick that

90
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:46,740
I picked up early on my drag career

91
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:48,750
so tell me what was like to have a short

92
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:51,960
race it was so weird

93
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:54,090
honestly like yeah I'm love me too so

94
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:56,220
when we when I walk to the workroom I

95
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:59,160
was like I had I was going to say like

96
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:01,560
hi mom or something funny like that but

97
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:03,840
all I could think was like oh my god

98
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,690
like this is what it looks like it felt

99
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:10,730
like I jumped into my TV screaming can

100
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:10,730
you imagine James for every season

101
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:19,620
season to be on the show okay guys now

102
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,910

103
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,530
James I was gonna do this he like

104
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:24,180
freaked out he was like what the heck

105
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:25,770
that's so against the world I'm very

106
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,200
very nervous so basically a baritone

107
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:30,000
that she's going to be putting my

108
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:34,500
concealer on even though she already

109
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,630
powder with other eyes yeah if you are a

110
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,940
fan our beauty gurus and youtuber people

111
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:40,710
you know this is like rule number one

112
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:43,620
that you never ever apply well they

113
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:45,780
never said not to I think they

114
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,340
definitely have said that I've never

115
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,690
seen someone say that's a cool number

116
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:51,510

117
00:04:48,690 --> 00:05:00,210

196
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:43,120
very thick skin I just try to think like

stay positive and something and Chennai

198
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,140
[ __ ] out may be a stupid mistake that

199
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:48,520
people get mad or I like to sit back and

200
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,110
just take a look at the situation in see

201
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,970
like Heineken or ever thought of myself

202
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:53,440
as a person I know that's the only thing

203
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:55,000
you come to kind of see I approach it

204
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,980
there's no time machines yet and you

205
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,810
can't take things back so at that point

206
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:00,400
like it was can you do besides to learn

207
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:02,440
it just better yourself in the situation

208
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,760
you know well yeah and a lot of people

209
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,760
that want to criticize you right now

210
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:09,190
honestly if they people dug up what they

211
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:11,170
said on Twitter they're 12 years old

212
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:13,560
everyone is problematic looking like

213
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:15,779
everybody has that things

214
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,949
they would not publicize it's just my

215
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:18,839
rock your type

216
00:09:16,949 --> 00:09:20,069
yeah like I wasn't on the hot end

217
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:21,480
tonight because I said it and they were

218
00:09:20,069 --> 00:09:23,220
stupid they were literally ignorant but

219
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,079
I think nobody should really be like

220
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,670
judged on what on things that they said

221
00:09:25,079 --> 00:09:28,350
so long like anything can happen they

222
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:29,759
can change somebody like so they can

223
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,930
have an ATAR oh that could be you know

224
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:33,059
what I'm mostly a different person here

225
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:35,339
last night circulate nobody should be

226
00:09:33,059 --> 00:09:37,499
judged on what they selling even like a

227
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:38,970
year ago alone four years ago the fact

228
00:09:37,499 --> 00:09:40,470
that anything was that at four years ago

229
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:43,019
is not an excuse because it doesn't make

230
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:44,459
it okay but I feel like nobody should be

231
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:47,249
judged for what they said so longer

232
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:49,019
because people change and trust me a lot

233
00:09:47,249 --> 00:09:51,029
of people agree with you on that know

234
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:52,499
that we finished the liner let's go in

235
00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:55,139
and cut that crease a little bit of the

236
00:09:52,499 --> 00:09:57,600
black eyeshadow yeah we had to move

237
00:09:55,139 --> 00:09:59,220
positions because I could not get over

238
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:03,180
there and do it at the same all it was

239
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:05,730
really hard cut ready to cut and we're

240
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:12,180
going to continue on a limited audience

241
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:13,620
hopefully with just to get supplies

242
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:16,139
other girls makeup

243
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:19,559
I mean honestly that's why I did it no

244
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:22,259
rightly I would assume so we're gonna

245
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:24,059
actually go into some jeffree star drug

246
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:26,339
lord I like to do this with like the

247
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:28,709
little white liner right there I've

248
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:32,209
never actually tried this on the lip but

249
00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:32,209
I love it as a liner

250
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:41,360
I got this time for brows guy I feel

251
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,310
like so nervous because you're like the

252
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:47,950
king of promise

253
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:47,950
give me parables that's what you're

254
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:57,589
talking about on Twitter all the time

255
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:59,630
like I wish that maybe just one time in

256
00:10:57,589 --> 00:11:02,570
my life that's symmetrical eyebrow I

257
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:04,160
feel like I do Drive I can like to slay

258
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:06,410
the face and the conjurer eyes

259
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:09,320
I think that's harsh muted brows really

260
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:11,209
I don't like it because my brows I'm so

261
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:15,290
used to like the very very straight like

262
00:11:11,209 --> 00:11:28,940
you know arch type of shape like so it's

263
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:31,040
very very hard don't care if I did this

264
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:33,980
off camera because it's like they can't

265
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,959
answer your sister I know but they they

266
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:37,459
can make it rhetorically answer and you

267
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:38,510
watch it because it okay we're gonna

268
00:11:37,459 --> 00:11:44,690
we're gonna do the other about

269
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:48,290
off-camera also at 17 hours the other

270
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:50,600
brow like I said my brows are never

271
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:54,170
symmetrical they're never even give me a

272
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:56,000
break I'm not like missing just be

273
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:57,829
laughs okay they might look a little

274
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,959
better after I clean it up of this so

275
00:11:57,829 --> 00:12:01,700
this next step I do I take a kind of

276
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:03,500
like a taupe color eyeshadow by Thomas

277
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,870
Aussie Beverly Hills this is a ash brown

278
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:08,420
I always like to take this and this is

279
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:11,560
kind of what I put the hairs in where I

280
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:15,380
think that it's like first I like to

281
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:19,610
line the bottom okay we're going in with

282
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:21,050
this um benefit roller lash that's

283
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:22,890
what's so cool about these particular

284
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:30,300
hairs is the thing

285
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:31,920
everybody like doll like a little or

286
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:36,200
like a little deer or something you know

287
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:38,580
like oh yeah

288
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:41,430
so when I always like to be afraid that

289
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:42,930
the lashes on is like go over one last

290
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:44,250
time with the liquid liner because

291
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:47,190
especially with like a white eyeshadow

292
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:49,530
it'll always fall and if I'm feeling

293
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:53,840
really extra I'll bring the liquid liner

294
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:56,250
to the club you're like crazy I'm so so

295
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:58,230
well I like why would they make them all

296
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,850
bring so much with me I always have my

297
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:02,850
Beauty Blender at much looser stylish

298
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:04,440
royal so it wouldn't be a pheromone look

299
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:08,310
without the little individual bottom

300
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:11,040
lashes so we see we go back in with that

301
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:17,490
