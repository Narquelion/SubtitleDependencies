9
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,839
i am so beyond excited because for

10
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,880
today's video we are doing something

11
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,680
that i have not done in

12
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,800
so so long now and that is a beauty

13
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,080
battle this is one of my favorite

14
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,199
segments that we do here on this youtube

15
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,439
channel but it has been a long time

16
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,560
because i have not had an iconic duo

17
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,320
such as the demilio sisters you know to

18
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,439
fight it out yay

19
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,760
do you guys have any idea what the

20
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,000
beauty bottles are um have you seen them

21
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,880
yeah i'll do one half of your face she

22
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,600
does the other one

23
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,559
sure and i win great she's probably

24
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,640
gonna win

25
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,760
but i'm not gonna quit okay sure that's

26
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,960
the good attitude to have

27
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,320
so we already obviously filmed a

28
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,440
collaboration together where i did your

29
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,280
makeup do you think that's gonna give

30
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,000
you an advantage in today's challenge

31
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,559
i think that definitely helped as well

32
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,920
as

33
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,239
the fact that i've been watching your

34
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,559
videos for a long time and

35
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,879
i know a lot of your tips and tricks

36
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,239
charlie watches videos and practices but

37
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,359
i'm going to do my best i'm going to

38
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,400
make you look pretty that's all that

39
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,880
matters at the end of the day

40
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,760
you already look pretty so just like

41
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,200

42
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,560
face in half charlie will get one side

43
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,080

44
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,000

started

60
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,439
we're starting off by using the brand

61
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,280
new morphe 2

62
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,560
skin tint that's such a fun name before

63
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,840
we even jump into anything like person

64
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,200
with this video i want to talk about a

65
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,479
little bit about this line because this

66
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,439
is really exciting to me i know this is

67
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,840
morphe's like

68
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,280
natural beauty line right yeah i haven't

69
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,479
heard it too much about this because

70
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,520
this is obviously a secret

71
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,119
when we're filming this and this is

72
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,520
still secret it will be coming out very

73
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,560
soon

74
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,119
so i'm going to let you guys tell me a

75
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:09,360
little bit about the line so basically

76
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:12,000
for us we have always been

77
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,800
just put up i'm so scared we have always

78
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,120
been into

79
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,360
a little bit more of a natural look

80
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,319
because i feel like that's what i really

81
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,920
enjoy wearing and

82
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,520
full glam is definitely out of my

83
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,000
comfort zone so

84
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,680
when morphe showed us the collection it

85
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,120
was like everything that i had wanted

86
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,360
and that was something that i

87
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,959
really enjoyed seeing so and like every

88
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,800
time we're in a meeting talking about

89
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,879
how everything happened the first thing

90
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,239
we say is charlie's natural and that's

91
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,599
what people like they like seeing her

92
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,280
personality i mean i feel like there was

93
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,160
a period in time on the internet for so

94
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,840
long where like

95
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,200
everybody was like full glam and i mean

96
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,959
hello obviously like i'm

97
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,560
one to talk and like still very much my

98
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,000
style but more than ever especially with

99
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,440
tick tock there's a huge emphasis on

100
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,080
like natural beauty which i really

101
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,280
really like

102
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,319
like i was really excited when i heard

103
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,440
about this line as well because like

104
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,480
sometimes i still want to get ready in

105
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,800
the morning and look cute but like not

106
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,280
have

107
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,239
fallen on anymore i love the natural

108
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,959
makeup look

109
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,120
like on you really so much yeah like

110
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,319
even when i started on tik tok like i

111
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,680
would get people saying like she doesn't

112
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,159
wear any makeup and i'm like no i do

113
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,920
it's just

114
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,760
very very natural because that's what i

115
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,920
like i also i'm a dancer

116
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,440
and dancing with heavy makeup is

117
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,120
sometimes a lot that's why i've

118
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,080
literally stopped filming dancing tick

119
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,840
tocks with makeup on

120
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,840
because i'm awful at dancing

121
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,200
and it takes me like 30 tries to

122
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,640
actually get the choreography down and

123
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,920
by the end of it i'll be literally like

124
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,080
wet with sweat which is

125
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,680
disgusting it's so bad i just can't do

126
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,480
it i mean i didn't even start wearing

127
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,239
makeup till

128
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,920
not even two years ago i would wear it

129
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,560
to like dance competitions but that was

130
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,400
really it

131
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,840
because i i also didn't feel comfortable

132
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,319
going out with makeup on because i was

133
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,799
just

134
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,080
so not like me but then i found products

135
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,080
that really worked with

136
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,519
the style that i was going for right how

137
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,599
was it working with morphe on the line

138
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,640
i think everything the shoot was one of

139
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,720
our first

140
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,319
like big professional shoots like that

141
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,239
so it was something really was it really

142
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,920
that we were able to experience together

143
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,280
that's so fun it was really cool seeing

144
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,640
everything come together

145
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,640
because we were putting on the

146
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,080
jelly shimmer well obviously this is a

147
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,680
project that you guys got to work on

148
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,280
together but one thing that i definitely

149
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,760
want to talk about since charlie and i

150
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,000
already did

151
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,879
our video dixie speaking of doing

152
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,879
separate things

153
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,959
you just released your hit song called

154
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,760
mary's buddies just kidding it's called

155
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,199
being happy

156
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,199
i want to hear all about it how was it

157
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:22,320
how is the reaction been okay so

158
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:24,240
i started recording um like a couple

159
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,680
months ago and this was the first song i

160
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,199
recorded and

161
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,880
so i grew up singing and then it was

162
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,960
like when this all started happening

163
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,479
my manager was in the music business and

164
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,360
he was like if you grew up singing like

165
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,520
you should sing

166
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,880
right oh no and then finally my dad was

167
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,240
like just do it like it's worth like

168
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,840
there's no point in not trying it if i

169
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,880
don't sing in front of anyone like

170
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,000
i heard you thinking like under your

171
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,120
breath a few times when we were hanging

172
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,080
out and i was like wait a second you're

173
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,600
like kind of

174
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,360
good i was like oh my gosh she's like

175
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,520
kind of it i literally had a panic

176
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,520
attack releasing the song or like

177
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,040
yeah in the videos i posted on take talk

178
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,919
i would freak out and shut off my phone

179
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,520
after i posted them

180
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,800
as an influencer it is really hard

181
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,240
because of course you have a major

182
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,440
advantage when you release a song you

183
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,479
know it's going to be supported and

184
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,919
that's an amazing thing

185
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,280
but you're now opening up the song to

186
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,919
criticism from millions and millions of

187
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,039
people

188
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,479
like that's why i haven't released a

189
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,600
song yet because like music is such a

190
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,039
huge part of my life but it's also one

191
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,479
thing that i made fun of so often

192
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,160
because there's so many awful videos of

193
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,360
me singing online so like if i was to

194
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,400
ever release music it would have to be

195
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,320
like the perfect

196
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,160
and it's so easy to lose a passion for

197
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,320
something if everyone's like

198
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,680
yeah and that's what i didn't want to do

199
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,280
like i didn't want to take something i

200
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,639
enjoyed and share it and then lose the

201
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,560
passion for it because

202
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,759
of hate comments yeah personally i think

203
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,880
it's a bop like i

204
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,560
at first i was like oh this is like a

205
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,000
cute little song and stuff and then i

206
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,880
noticed that i literally was singing it

207
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,840
nonstop

208
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,560
like i was literally just sitting in the

209
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,840
kitchen like sometimes i don't wanna

210
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,199
be oh obviously the whole like bars nice

211
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,639
thing has become a meme but i love that

212
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,320
you like joined in

213
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,000
on it as well like at this point you

214
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,440
just have to know like people just

215
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,120
want to make jokes i don't like it

216
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,680
doesn't bother me experience she's a

217
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,080
singer

218
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,960
does this look good yeah it does um also

219
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,960
miss charlie

220
00:05:52,960 --> 00:06:00,120
you just hit 70 7-0 70 million

221
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02,720
followers on tick-tock like that is

222
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,400
absolutely insane that's literally more

223
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,080
than the population of italy and the

224
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,120
population of france and the population

225
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:12,560
of australia and so

226
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,479
to me how like is it even possible to

227
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,680
process that number i feel like

228
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:19,120
in my head it's just like it's so weird

229
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,800
to even think about that

230
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,479
that's a literal country an actual

231
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,600
country that's crazy i want to ask you

232
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,880
guys as well because when we and charlie

233
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,039

241
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,400

good interpretation of

dancing don't be rude

266
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,400
my body literally does not move in that

267
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,319
way

268
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,680
how would you guys describe your like

269
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,160
relationship living together

270
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,000
and also working together the worst i

271
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,879
literally went into her room last night

272
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,680
when she got home

273
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,479
no to show her the clothes that i got

274
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,479
for her

275
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,759
and i opened the door and she closes the

276
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,560
door in my face but

277
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:02,639
yesterday morning i was sleeping my

278
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,240
first day off in a very long time i was

279
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,160
sleeping it was

280
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,840
charlie's mad i was sleeping it's a

281
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,639
saturday morning and she goes

282
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,000
dancing knocking on the door super

283
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,680
exciting and i cared a lot

284
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,840
to let her and it was something so

285
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,039
stupid oh my only problem with her she

286
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,879
doesn't apologize

287
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,919
oh god i shouldn't have to apologize no

288
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,720
when you do things wrong you never

289
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,840
apologize until i forget

290
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,319

291
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:29,360
apologize she goes i'm sorry

292
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,919
okay which is an apology but it's not a

293
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,159
real

294
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:34,000
i don't know so really good is to answer

295
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,279
that question no no no it's the best

296
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,200
i like working together because we're

297
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,560
like there for each other because if

298
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,080
people like like if we don't want to

299
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,360
speak up for ourselves on something like

300
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,880
the other one can

301
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,399
when we're like doing stuff if like i

302
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,760
don't know what's if i'm not like

303
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,279
comfortable don't like have a personal

304
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,880
experience with like whatever

305
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,720
like she can talk about it we don't

306
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,800
fight that much but when we do it's bad

307
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,080
i see that all right well charlie and

308
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,640
dixie i guess that is this

309
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,120

for me i'd say that i'm very very proud

315
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,480
of it and i feel like

316
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,240
the base super super natural which i

317
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,880
love but the eye i did a

318
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,600
little teensy bit of a glam moment i was

319
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,839
very very proud

320
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,800

mine's perfect

322
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,320
