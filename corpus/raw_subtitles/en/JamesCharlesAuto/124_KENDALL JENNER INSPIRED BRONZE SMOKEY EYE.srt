00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:08,280
hi sisters James Charles here and

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:09,870
welcome back to my youtube channel so as

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,580
you can see we are in a completely new

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,889
and different setup I'm actually filming

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,509
in my old Beauty room because a few days

6
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:17,130
ago I decided last second to turn my

7
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:19,410
film in I grew up into a walk-in closet

8
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,760
literally the most obnoxious first for a

9
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,109
problem ever but I was actually running

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,000
out of storage in my closet and I was

11
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:25,380
thinking oh my god I want to focus more

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,670
on clothes because you guys disheartened

13
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,439
to realize that I usually wear the same

14
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,340
five outfits like every single week

15
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,080
which is getting a little bit

16
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,700
embarrassing at this point so sister

17
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,920
wants to step up her fashion again for

18
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,600
sure I decided that I wanted to change

19
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,309
my filming room into a walk-in closet

20
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,360
which I now have installed and you guys

21
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:41,219
will be singing the apartment tour

22
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,450
coming on very very soon but that left

23
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:43,770
me with a very rear dilemma of not

24
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,660
having anywhere to film so I actually

25
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,090
just converted my Beauty room into a

26
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,680
beauty and filming room mr. Kay helped

27
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,730
me it is so freakin beautiful so I

28
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,620
really really hope you guys are enjoying

29
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,660
the new setup it's just it's very very

30
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,250
simple background with shells and

31
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,360
paintings and yeah definitely comment

32
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,920
down below and tell me if you like it

33
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,090
let me know if the audio is good let me

34
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,530
know if the Lighting's good this is the

35
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,699
first video I've ever even film sitting

36
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,379
down here so I'm trying my best to make

37
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:06,510
sure it is all set up but of course as

38
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:07,770
we go on and things progress I'll get

39
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:09,570
better and things will be perfect and

40
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:12,390
the way they were before and back to

41
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,680
normal James Charles quality all that

42
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,270
being said I've heard today's video as

43
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,130
you can see I'm wearing this bronzy very

44
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:19,200
very simple glam this is actually

45
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:20,670
kendall Jenner inspired look her makeup

46
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,189
artist hong van gogh i think that's how

47
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,180
you pronounce his name posted a

48
00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:25,680
beautiful freakin picture of Kendall on

49
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,119
his Instagram and I was cooked to the

50
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,909
core and I wanted to recreate this look

51
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,259
so so about me obviously the Jenner and

52
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:32,790
Kardashian's always have iconic makeup

53
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:34,140
looks that everybody's always recreating

54
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:36,509
if you guys want to see how I created

55
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,220
this bronzy glowy winged out shadow

56
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:40,530
moment inspired by at Kendall J herself

57
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,000
make sure you keep on watching alright

58
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,920
so since this is a super dewy and

59
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,119
moisturized look I'm first gonna start

60
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,579
off by priming my face using my a

61
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,649
benefit total moisture cream I've

62
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:51,570
recently been loving this cream so

63
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:52,799
freakin much if you guys know me you

64
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,540
would know that the skincare is not

65
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,070
exactly something that I've learned a

66
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,409
lot about or kind of focused on in the

67
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:00,360
past but I've been trying to get into it

68
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:02,909
a little bit more recently because I'm

69
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,070
not trying to be you know chronically

70
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:06,990
and gross by the time I get to like 21

71
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:09,149
so I want to have nice and glowy skin

72
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,470
forever so I have been moisturizing a

73
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:11,879
lot more recently and I've truly but

74
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,300
actually seen like a major change in my

75
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:14,340
skin

76
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,020
I've been trying to cut out the Pepsi as

77
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,700
such as it hurts and drink a lot more

78
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,870
water too but honestly Ivan seemed like

79
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,940
such a major difference

80
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:22,590
I had this breakout so going on from my

81
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,300
New York trip but she's heading away

82
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:26,280
she's on the way out I told her to pack

83
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,930
her bags hopefully we'll be back to

84
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,680
Dewey and beautiful skin within the next

85
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:31,920
few weeks

86
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,390
fingers crossed in this amazing photo

87
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,310
Kendall's makeup artist hung it gave her

88
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:37,320
this beautiful dewy moisturize

89
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:38,850
foundation look as always that we all

90
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,200
strive for but can't really achieve

91
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:42,450
because it only looks good for about

92
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,070
five seconds but for today's look to

93
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,750
recreate this as closely as possible I'm

94
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:50,340
gonna use the Giorgio Armani luminous

95
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:51,750
silk foundation I'm going to be doing a

96
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,850
super super light coat of this

97
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:55,080
foundation all over my skin I really do

98
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:56,610
not want to do it like the full coverage

99
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,830
today I just want a very very light

100
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:00,030
layer just to even everything out but

101
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:02,160
still give us enough coverage to the

102
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:04,080
point where like our blemishes and red

103
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,150
spots are covered because Lord knows

104
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,970
thanks New York we have a lot of them

105
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:10,230
right now next I'm gonna grab the Tarte

106
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:12,270
shave tape concealer and this is in the

107
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:13,560
shade light/medium honey and I'm just

108
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:15,600
gonna use these slightest bit of this

109
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,000
just to go over any areas that have a

110
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:24,420
little bit more breakouts like right up

111
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,890
in here here here I'm basically just

112
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,240
applying a super light amount of this on

113
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:28,950
any areas that need a little bit more

114
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,600
coverage did you guys do luminous look

115
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:32,040
has a beautiful finish but doesn't have

116
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,840
the most coverage in the world so I'm

117
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,130
just gonna use this to just amp up those

118
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:40,650
areas and really make sure we have that

119
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:41,880
flawless but still a dewy finish when I

120
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,100
blend this in I'm just blending it in

121
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,300
super super lightly to make sure to just

122
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:48,740
bounce it in and blend it without

123
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,740
actually taking off I need the product

124
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,080
and then to actually bright and I'm

125
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,460
going to grab a shape tape once again

126
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,480
but this time in the shade a light and

127
00:03:54,460 --> 00:04:04,360
I'm just gonna do a little bit of that

128
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:05,710
under both of the eyes then I'm just

129
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,000
going to grab the slightest bit of Laura

130
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:08,740
Mercier powder and I'm just going to

131
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,720
lightly set underneath my eyes and

132
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:12,720
that's actually about it

133
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,010
for the contour and Bronson a for once

134
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,389
in my life B cap on D shade and light

135
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:25,250
palette is nowhere to be seen on the

136
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:27,740
front of my table and sadang abusing the

137
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:29,930
benefit hoola light bronzer until Pilate

138
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:36,260
said I'm using my makeup Shack t 28

139
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:38,210
brush I think I've only used this

140
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:40,669
bronzer maybe once before because you

141
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:44,150
guys know sister James loves a good a

142
00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:45,080
bronze a cut contour but for today

143
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,360
second I feel like I just want to keep

144
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,560
it really really light and do we just

145
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,300
like the photo of camel because it was

146
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,520
literally so stunning like my breath was

147
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,810
taken away and I want to recreate it as

148
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,400
closely as possible and Kendall was

149
00:04:53,810 --> 00:05:02,270
really not too a contour she just had

150
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:03,380
like a nice bronze look going on for

151
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:05,000
brows that I'm going to quickly define

152
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:12,830
them using my Anasazi offense on the

153
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:14,180
shade medium at Brown in the photo that

154
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:16,610
Kendall's makeup artist shared she had a

155
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:18,770
super super thin and just really really

156
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:20,150
arched brows and those things are two

157
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:22,100
qualities that definitely are not

158
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:24,320
associated with James Charles brows

159
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:26,090
that's for sure so I'm just trying my

160
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,800
best to really define them the least

161
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:28,820
amount possible and just kind of fill

162
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,470
them in and give it a little bit more

163
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,250
shape but still keep them really really

164
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:35,690
the light and airy

165
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:36,710
just like kendall ash and lastly to

166
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:38,570
finish off the brows I'm just gonna go

167
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:39,979
to the Anasazi a clear brow gel and I'm

168
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:42,080
just gonna brush those hairs upwards to

169
00:05:39,979 --> 00:05:44,270
create the light and fluffy feathered

170
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,370
brow effect to primary let's for Santa

171
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:48,530
I'm just gonna add a drop of the shape

172
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:49,910
tape light/medium honey on the lids and

173
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:52,760
then I'm just gonna blend that and using

174
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:55,100
my makeup Shack tee at 59 brush just to

175
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:56,510
give a light and even base for the

176
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:59,960
little bit of shadow that we're going to

177
00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:01,820
put on there the hashed out of today

178
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,500
we're gonna be using the morphe 35o

179
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:05,150
palette and listen i know you guys are

180
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,070
probably so sick of hearing all about

181
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:08,870
this palette but trusty it is actually a

182
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:10,310
really really good palette I just feel

183
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,539
like with a lot of celebrity makeup we

184
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:13,310
all like look at these celebrities at

185
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:15,020
this beautiful glowing glam and we just

186
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:16,160
want to recreate them on ourselves but

187
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,450
oftentimes we feel as though because

188
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,430
they're celebrities they're usually

189
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:21,320
using like million-dollar makeup so

190
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:22,880
obviously the 3500 was a very very cheap

191
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,490
alternative to very very expensive

192
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,050
palettes it is $22 for 35 shades and you

193
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:28,130
guys can use code James for tempers and

194
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,470
love your purchase at morphe brushes

195
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:30,970
calm I

196
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:32,920
yeah it's gonna be a bomb pilot to serve

197
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:35,050
this look obviously used it ever a brown

198
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,730
orange home palette you want to but I'm

199
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,990
gonna go with this baby today to lay

200
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,730
down at light base in the crease I'm

201
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:42,520
gonna go with my makeup Shack t4 brush

202
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:50,260
and dip into this cool tone orange shade

203
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:51,670
right here for this actual makeup look

204
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:53,620
Kendall had her inner corner pretty

205
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:54,700
light and then it got more and more dark

206
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,350
and defined as we got to the outer

207
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:58,540
corner when we get to that super

208
00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:00,520
snatched upward V which I am so excited

209
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:02,110
for but yeah for the starting shades I'm

210
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,220
gonna keep them very very light and just

211
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:05,530
make sure they are nice and evenly

212
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:07,540
blended out next I'm gonna grab my

213
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:09,790
makeup shock t-33 brush and dip into

214
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:11,860
this warm tone orange right up in here

215
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:13,720
I'm gonna focus this color on the outer

216
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:14,890
lid and then jog whatever is left up

217
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,750
into the crease and make sure they are

218
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:21,669
blended out and then a little bit into

219
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:23,200
the inner corner next under grab that

220
00:07:21,669 --> 00:07:24,850
same exact brush and dip into this cool

221
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,680
tone Brown right below it and start to

222
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:28,210
define the outer corner I'm gonna be

223
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,280
very very slow impatient when layering

224
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:31,419
this color onto that outer third even

225
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,490
though this look is supposed to be like

226
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:34,600
that effortless glam look those looks

227
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,980
are usually the ones that actually take

228
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,900
the most amount of work ironically

229
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:39,370
enough so I'm just being super super

230
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,780
careful I'm blending it very very slowly

231
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:42,490
and lightly to make sure we still have

232
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:44,650
everything really really blown out and

233
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:46,150
even once you get to that outer corner

234
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:47,080
I'm also taking that shadow on the tip

235
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:51,190
of the brush and I'm going to start

236
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:52,630
winging outwards dipping into that same

237
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:55,479
last dark brown shade I'm gonna grab my

238
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:56,979
morphe r44 basically just use any angled

239
00:07:55,479 --> 00:07:59,410
brush you want and I'm going to try to

240
00:07:56,979 --> 00:08:02,250
sketch out that little wing that kind of

241
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:02,250
had it going on

242
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,950
then govern my makeup Shakti to brush

243
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:11,540
I'm just going to lightly blend out that

244
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:14,290
line and diffuse that darker color

245
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,290
inwards

246
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,740
and then one last time gonna grab that

247
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:24,850
t4 brush and just blend over those I

248
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:27,250
just make sure everything is really

249
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:33,370
really nice and defined but still a

250
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:34,570
blended well up together now that we had

251
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:36,159
this line all sketched out it is very

252
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:37,599
very defined looking and I'm loving how

253
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,099
it looks but I definitely do want to

254
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,539
clean it up the slightest bit but I feel

255
00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:42,760
like using concealers is gonna make it

256
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:45,880
look too intense so I'm gonna do is grab

257
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:47,410
the Mac next to nothing studio nope just

258
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:50,020
kidding' just the next to nothing a

259
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:51,430
pressed powder and my makeup Shakti 86

260
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:53,080
brush and I'm gonna dab just the

261
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:55,120
lightest bit of that and I'm going to

262
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:57,580
use that powder just to kind of sketch

263
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:04,060
the bottom just to clean it up

264
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:05,470
oh yeah that literally looks a million

265
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,580
times better the lower lash line

266
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:08,650
normally the first thing I would do

267
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:10,600
would be line it so we can it then smoke

268
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:12,190
out the shadow below it but I actually

269
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,930
can't find a mile an hour that I was

270
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:16,210
gonna use I usually love using the NYX

271
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:18,070
tan liner I brought it out to film and

272
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:19,540
now I cannot find it anywhere so I'm

273
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:21,880
just gonna go into the benefit high brow

274
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:22,630
pencil instead is this eye safe I have

275
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,279
no idea

276
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:26,860
couldn't tell you but it's a light

277
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:29,100
off-white shade so it's gonna do the job

278
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,100
anyway

279
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:35,770
okay Wow I honestly have no idea this is

280
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,110
even safe for the eyes but it goes on

281
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:41,200
really really nicely and it's super

282
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:42,820
pigmented as well so sorry next guess

283
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,770
we're using benefit high brow from now

284
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:46,180
on for the lower lash line it's gonna be

285
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:48,220
super super simple I'm just gonna start

286
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:50,350
off with my 82 brush and dip into that

287
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:51,670
cool tone of brown right below our poor

288
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:59,290
orange shade that we use on the upper

289
00:09:51,670 --> 00:10:00,910
lash line and I'm just oh there she is

290
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:02,680
I'm just using this brush and pressing

291
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:03,640
the shade right up into that lash line

292
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,890
just to create a little bit of a

293
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,090
defining moment and I am gonna bring

294
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:08,740
that shadow all the way into the inner

295
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:11,530
corner as well which is saying that I

296
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:15,940
normally don't do it but Kendall had it

297
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:16,480
so we're gonna do it today next I'm just

298
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,340
gonna grab my

299
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,200
t-49 brush and dip into the original

300
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:25,660
light orange shade that we used and just

301
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:26,860
buff out those edges to highlight my

302
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:28,780
inner corner and brow bone I'm gonna

303
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:31,720
grab my ETA t6 brush and dip into the

304
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:33,190
Laura Geller gilded honey highlighter

305
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,660
and there's going to push my brush a

306
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:37,860
little bit of a fix plus to make it

307
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,860
super intense and blinding

308
00:10:44,529 --> 00:10:48,099
as we are only doing lashes today Lord

309
00:10:46,749 --> 00:10:49,689
knows that wearing a lot of falsies

310
00:10:48,099 --> 00:10:51,939
continuously it rips them out of my face

311
00:10:49,689 --> 00:10:53,469
all the time which is so so sad so I

312
00:10:51,939 --> 00:10:55,179
don't have very many lashes left to work

313
00:10:53,469 --> 00:10:57,129
with I am gonna go into the lash curler

314
00:10:55,179 --> 00:10:59,139
quickly and just snatch those lashes up

315
00:10:57,129 --> 00:11:03,759
so just to help without defining a

316
00:10:59,139 --> 00:11:05,199
process and then for mascara today I'm

317
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:07,889
going to be using the Maybelline Big

318
00:11:05,199 --> 00:11:07,889
Shot mascara

319
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:18,819
all right status when I complete I'm

320
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,139
gonna go and do the other one off-camera

321
00:11:18,819 --> 00:11:22,529
quickly and then I'll be right back with

322
00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:24,399
you finish off the rest of the face

323
00:11:22,529 --> 00:11:25,720
alright and that is both eyes all

324
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,970
complete and the next step of course is

325
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,230
going to be the glow I'm gonna use once

326
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:31,720
again gilded honey and I'm going to use

327
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,769
my Alexi 560 brush and I'm going to dip

328
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,540
into this and I'm going to put this

329
00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:36,399
right on the highest points of my

330
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:37,720
cheekbones now I would normally would

331
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,860
never use fan brush when it comes to

332
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,319
highlighting because I don't know I just

333
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:42,699
have never like learned to use them but

334
00:11:41,319 --> 00:11:43,959
I was watching desi Perkins new video

335
00:11:42,699 --> 00:11:45,730
today where she tell her subscribers on

336
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:48,339
how to cover up cystic acne and it

337
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:50,589
looked so beyond Bom I was like so

338
00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:52,300
intrigued the entire video but I noticed

339
00:11:50,589 --> 00:11:54,310
when she got to her highlighter she used

340
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,420
a fan brush and I just looked so

341
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:57,250
freaking pretty sounds like you know

342
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:59,199
what if does he looks hot I want to look

343
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:04,379
hot too so I'm trying this outside and

344
00:11:59,199 --> 00:12:04,379
honestly so far I don't actually hate it

345
00:12:04,889 --> 00:12:08,829
I'm also gonna use this bar so I'm gonna

346
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:11,079
apply it right on the tops of my brow

347
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:14,800
bone on my forehead for that healthy and

348
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:16,149
natural glow okay I'm actually really

349
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,199
liking the way that a fan brush applies

350
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:21,899
highlighter this could be like a

351
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:21,899
freaking revelation up in here

352
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:32,480
oh look so pretty I'm gonna go that say

353
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:36,550
behind later on a tiny pencil brush and

354
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,550
I'm gonna use this to highlight my nose

355
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,870
now to finish this look off all we have

356
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,970
left is lips I'm first going to the Mac

357
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:46,410
strip down liner and just over line my

358
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:49,190
lips the slightest bit to give me a

359
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:49,190
little bit more dimension

360
00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:07,869
oh my god these sirens are so annoying

361
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:07,869
[Music]

362
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:17,260
are we done yet nope

363
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:19,000
as in for the lips today we're gonna be

364
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:21,990
using the new dose of colors lipstick in

365

the shade butterscotch

366
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,410
just as Orca that's up these slightest

367
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,149

368
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:38,879

369
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:44,899
into the to face new melted latex liquid

370
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:44,899

372
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:59,220
oh okay so I'm not really sure what you

373
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,649
would call this color now that we have

374
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:03,420
put on a lip liner a lipstick and then a

375
00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:05,459
gloss over top men wiped off the gloss

376
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:06,990
because we didn't like it but whatever

377
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:08,970
is like lapped on the face right now is

378
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:12,720

379
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:14,279
