00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
hi sisters James Charles here and

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,359
welcome back to my youtube channel

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:07,799
2017 was an absolutely crazy here and I

4
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:09,360
am so beyond thankful to all of you

5
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:11,380
sisters chose to stay with me through it

6
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,579
let's talk about it

7
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,579
[Music]

8
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:19,109
ironically enough this year started was

9
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,900
something that didn't exactly happen

10
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:24,930
this year as most of you already know on

11
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,670
October 11th of 2016 I officially became

12
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,289
the world's first cover boy

13
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,179
we broke history by becoming the first

14
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:32,940
male ambassador for a major beauty brand

15
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:34,680
and the world was shook my mother's

16
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,630
event didn't take place in 2017

17
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,219
however this opportunity changed my life

18
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:41,129
forever and my year probably would have

19
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:42,390
been very very boring without it in the

20
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:43,980
beginning of the year I made a huge

21
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:47,160
change in my life by graduating early

22
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,750
and moving to Los Angeles at age 17 it

23
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,129
was a tough choice to make but my hard

24
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,629
work in school allowed for it and my

25
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:53,730
parents knew deep down that it was the

26
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:55,320
right decision for me I found my dream

27
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,910
apartment after only a few tours and

28
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,399
ended up moving in only a couple of days

29
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:01,410
later I literally had so much fun

30
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:02,789
decorating and making it my own despite

31
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,110
the fact that I never actually films an

32
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:05,189
apartment tour even though I promised

33
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:08,580
you guys a million times

34
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:10,080
oops coming soon baby not gonna lie

35
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,210
living alone at such a young age is a

36
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,229
little bit spooky I do live the freedom

37
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,880
and I've always been a very very

38
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:16,710
independent and strong person but it

39
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,210
does get lonely I probably would not

40
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:21,000
have been able to survive here had I not

41
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,380
met my best friend Laura Milano her

42
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,360
family took me in as one of their own

43
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,950
for almost four months before I

44
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,990
officially moved here and those people

45
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,060
literally mean the entire world to me I

46
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:32,220
also meant the original sisters who

47
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,680
became my close family security blanket

48
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,900
and security guards at my meet and

49
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,829
greets as many of you guys know from

50
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,990
following your favorite youtubers

51
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:42,030
personal lives and drama Ellie doesn't

52
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:44,100
exactly have the best track record for

53
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,810
genuine people but luckily along with

54
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,860
Laura and the sisters I've been able to

55
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,689
surround myself with some positive

56
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:51,270
hard-working individuals and make some

57
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:52,920
amazing friendships along the way this

58
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,869
year I met Tati Westbrook another very

59
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,430
special friend of mine she's the mom of

60
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:58,229
the YouTube makeup world and also like a

61
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,939
mother figure to me she's helped me

62
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:01,409
become a better and wiser person and has

63
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:03,180
given me literally all the makeup

64
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:04,740
knowledge I could ever ask for

65
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,870
last January talk to you in her

66
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,980
now-husband James flew me to Hawaii to

67
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:10,500
do her wedding makeup which is an

68
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:12,000
experience I will never forget a long

69
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,260
stead of Tottie's wedding video I also

70
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,600
cloud with some other really cool people

71
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:18,210
this year I did a few videos of Laura's

72
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,310
husband who you guys know as Danny the

73
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:21,660
road was also not ready for the

74
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,380
introduction of my little brother to my

75
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,260
youtube channel

76
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:26,820
better known as sister yet brother I am

77
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,320
truly blessed to have such strong

78
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,610
masculine men in my life that are

79
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,290
comfortable and loving enough to

80
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:34,080
publicly support me and my career

81
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:36,330
it truly does mean so much speaking of

82
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,890
masculine men I was graced with the

83
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,930
opportunity of filming with the loves of

84
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:41,940
my life and future husbands the Dolan

85
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,050
twins our relationship started from me

86
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,120
leaving Thursday comments on their

87
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:46,470
Instagram pages but it now blows my mind

88
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,720
to think that they are two of my closest

89
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,950
friends collabs are my favorite videos

90
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,209
to film and I'm very proud of the

91
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,590
content that I was able to create with

92
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:55,320
some of my favorite contact craters that

93
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,760
I've always looked up to not only did I

94
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,230
get to work with some dope youtubers but

95
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,670
I also got to meet a few celebrities

96
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:02,520
that have had a major impact on my life

97
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:04,380
I met Kim Kardashian and Ariana Grande

98
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,820
culture for the first time her makeup

99
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,980
artist and one of my personal role

100
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:09,239
models Margit Ivanovitch had told her

101
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,040
that I was there and she said her

102
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:13,050
security guard to escort me to meet her

103
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,700
my heart was racing at a million miles

104
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:16,019
per hour but I somehow managed to pull

105
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,060
it together and I couldn't stop smiling

106
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:19,680
for literally the entire next week I

107
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,959
must have been annoying enough that she

108
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,970
didn't forget me because when she lost

109
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:26,880
her beauty line at k'kaw Beauty I was

110
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:28,110
invited to her house to celebrate I've

111
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,790
always looked up to Kim because despite

112
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:31,739
what any tabloids or media has to say

113
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:33,660
about her she's a genius and a classy

114
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:35,850
businesswoman and genuinely a super kind

115
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:37,590
person I also made a friendship with in

116
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:38,430
my opinion the most talented vocalist of

117
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:40,830
our generation

118
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:42,090
Demi Lovato she followed me on Instagram

119
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:44,220
and I said him to her dm's and

120
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:45,570
miraculously she replied we started

121
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,580
discussing everything from her new music

122
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:49,739
to my new makeup looks too even on

123
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:51,959
internet memes how can we forget pute

124
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:53,700
Lovato she invited me to her documentary

125
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:55,170
premiere a few weeks ago where I finally

126
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,700
got to meet her in person and we took an

127
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:58,739
iconic photo and I could think her for

128
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:00,390
all she's done for me while this year

129
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:02,280
was filled with many highs and also had

130
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:03,330
some major lows and at one point I

131
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,130
quickly went from everyone's favorite

132
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:07,799
cover boy to the most problematic

133
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:09,180
youtuber of all time in February I went

134
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:10,200
on a trip to South Africa with some

135
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,000
friends from school that I had been

136
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,220
saving up for and looking forward to for

137
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,630
four years prior before the plane could

138
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,990
even depart the runway I made a joke

139
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,730
about

140
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:19,410
Ebola and my friend thought I was

141
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:21,239
talking about the food virus ecoli

142
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:22,710
I tweeted about her mistake without

143
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:25,380
thinking twice and the plane took off

144
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,940
when we landed just one hour later in DC

145
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,440
for a layover I remember checking

146
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:30,270
Twitter and my heart dropping to the

147
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,280
floor a news article was written and

148
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,990
went viral titled cover boy James

149
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,660
Charles says that the only thing Africa

150
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:38,250
has to offer is Ebola I was so confused

151
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,990
and my first reaction was to fight back

152
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,760
being that my tweet had no harmful

153
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:43,680
intentions and I was now under public

154
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,570
scrutiny I tried to brush it off and

155
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,280
make a quick apology but after 26 hours

156
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:49,290
of flying and no internet access about

157
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,490
the Atlantic Ocean I quickly realized I

158
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:52,560
had messed up big time and that there

159
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:54,270
was no going back I remember spending

160
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,190
the first day in my hotel room in Africa

161
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:57,300
sobbing alone thousands of miles away

162
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,950
from the people that I loved the most

163
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,060
and unable to communicate or defend

164
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:02,190
myself to the thousands of people

165
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,390
following me online it was a rough few

166
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,980
days but there was one day on the trip

167
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:07,350
that changed my life and perspective

168
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:08,610
forever we visited a high school called

169
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,110
edge Maine and I remember watching a

170
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:11,700
live drum performance for the music kids

171
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,990
at the school in the middle of

172
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,670
performance the principal came in and

173
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:16,740
interrupted pass for someone named James

174
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:18,810
Charles I vividly remember my heart

175
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,860
stopping and my first instinct was that

176
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:22,170
they heard in my tweet and we're gonna

177
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,790
ask me to leave but to my surprise he

178
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:25,140
opened the door to the auditorium and

179
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:27,330
there was a huge crowd of kids outside

180
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:28,710
that had left their classes because they

181
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:31,200
had heard about my arrival and wanted to

182
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:32,760
meet me I instantly started crying as I

183
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,500
took photos while smiling and meeting

184
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,240
all these kids we started off by talking

185
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,190
about how our school systems differ from

186
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,180
each other but we quickly got very very

187
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:41,010
comfortable and started talking about

188
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,810
everything under the Sun we talked about

189
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:45,750
our everyday lives what we like to do

190
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:47,790
for fun boy and dating drama pop culture

191
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:49,080
and I was even able to have an open and

192
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:51,210
honest conversation with some of the

193
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:53,160
kids about my tweet and how it affected

194
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:55,800
them from that day on at my life

195
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,240
literally took a 360 degree turn and my

196
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,490
Africa trip consisted of some of the

197
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,840
best memories of my life my tweets from

198
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,740
White House are definitely not something

199
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,820
that I'm proud of

200
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,140
but being called out for them has

201
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,450
allowed me to educate myself and become

202
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:07,680
a genuinely better person and are not an

203
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,750
accurate representation of Who I am

204
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,710
today

205
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:12,270
aside from me growing and becoming a

206
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:13,680
better person there is no denying that

207
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:15,990
I've become a far better artist this

208
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,670
year back in March I took a flash photo

209
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:19,860
with a sister named Pam a Tammy agree

210
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:22,350
and after being filtered it turned out a

211
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:23,970
little bit ghostly the photo quickly got

212
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,340
into the hands of Stan Twitter and was

213
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:27,220
Enter

214
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:29,770
and D saturated and thus flashback Mary

215
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,150
was born at first I was upset by the

216
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:32,889
poor representation of my makeup skills

217
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:34,270
and everyone laughing at me but I

218
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:35,320
quickly learned to laugh with everyone

219
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:37,060
instead

220
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,320
I turned my hate into profit by making

221
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:40,919
one of my most successful videos on my

222
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:51,000
channel of all time recreating my memes

223
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:51,000
okay flashback Mary flashback Mary

224
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:01,720
flashback Mary deep down I think that

225
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:04,240
flashback Mary was a blessing in

226
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:06,370
disguise although it sucked at the time

227
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,960
my recreating my memes video definitely

228
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:09,820
got my creative juices flowing and

229
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,650
therefore opened the door for more

230
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:13,450
entertaining based content on my youtube

231
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:15,550
channel I can honestly look back and say

232
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:17,110
that I am really really proud of the

233
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:18,669
videos that I put out this year the

234
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:20,200
beauty community can sometimes get over

235
00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:21,940
flooded with repetitive tutorials and

236
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,590
challenges and I definitely set the bar

237
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:25,510
high and change the excitation for

238
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:27,490
beauty videos some of my favorites that

239
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:29,020
I did this year include my makeover

240
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:30,850
series where I got my makeup done an

241
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:32,080
Ulta Sephora and Mac which opened my

242
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:34,720
eyes to different styles and techniques

243
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,280
used by various artists testing fake

244
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,600
makeup where I compared knockoff

245
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,270
products to the real versions of the

246
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,800
most popular makeup items of the time

247
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:43,930
take her swimming on the first day where

248
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:46,240
I tested waterproof makeup products by

249
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:48,550
jumping into a pool makeup versus the

250
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,260
iPhone acts face IT where I tested the

251
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:51,789
capabilities of the brand-new iPhone on

252
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:54,220
the same day that it launched and

253
00:07:51,789 --> 00:07:55,870
finally singing my makeup routine an

254
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:57,310
original challenge series in which I

255
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:59,020
improv through some of my favorite songs

256
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,849
allowing me to combine two of my

257
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,770
all-time favorite passions music and

258
00:08:00,849 --> 00:08:03,820
makeup

259
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:05,410
speaking of music I also worked on my

260
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,849
voice a lot this year I was able to show

261
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:09,280
you guys a whole other realm of James

262
00:08:06,849 --> 00:08:10,930

263
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,099
of my best friends Anthony I also

264
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:14,229
started an acapella group called

265
00:08:12,099 --> 00:08:16,240
flashback we've only released two songs

266
00:08:14,229 --> 00:08:17,380
so far but I've accumulated more than 3

267
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,690
million views on our videos that have

268
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:20,979
had a ton of sales and are so excited to

269
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:22,960
keep working on more music in the future

270
00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:24,490
music plays a huge role in my life and

271
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,169
is now a huge part of the James Charles

272
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:28,479
brand if you will which is developed

273
00:08:26,169 --> 00:08:30,160
immensely sisters has quickly become one

274
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,780
of the most popular words on social

275
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,070
media what started off as a term of

276
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,680
endearment between my close friends that

277
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,060
I

278
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,229
we became my catchphrase which I

279
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:38,570
eventually turned is my very own

280
00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:40,099
clothing line sister's apparel we've

281
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:42,020

00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:45,260
gear sisters all around the globe and I

look forward to working at my fashion

285
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:48,890
sense and clothing line once more in

286
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:50,120
2018 I know y'all are getting a little

287
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:52,640
bit tired of me wearing the same for

288
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,120
Hardee's on a daily basis trust me me

289
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,339
too

290
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,560
I mentioned earlier that I graduated in

291
00:08:55,339 --> 00:08:59,149
January but in June I flew back home to

292
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,190
little old Bethlehem New York to get my

293
00:08:59,149 --> 00:09:02,390
diploma with the rest of my class I've

294
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:04,520
worked extremely hard in school and took

295
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:06,410
all advanced courses all while balancing

296
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:08,149
my at the time a small Instagram career

297
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:10,399
and a job at a frozen yogurt shop I

298
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:12,110
decided not to continue my education and

299
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,399
to work as a youtuber full-time but

300
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:15,410
walking to get my diploma and my

301
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:17,180
custom-made Michael Costello sawasdee

302
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:18,910
crystal jumpsuit was one of the most

303
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:21,290
fulfilling moments of my entire life

304
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:22,760
education is super important to me and I

305
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:24,649
am so thankful that I had a supportive

306
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,570
school system Laura's family actually

307
00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:28,160
flew all the way across America with me

308
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:30,500
to watch my special moment alongside of

309
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,810
my real family and some of you guys even

310
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:34,339
snuck into I've actually had a lot of

311
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:36,470
opportunities this year to meet and hugs

312
00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:38,690
so many of you guys face-to-face and I

313
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:40,580
look forward to so many more in 2018

314
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:41,810
I had an impromptu meeting great in the

315
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,820
middle of New York City and over a

316
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:45,110
thousand and you guys showed up even

317
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:47,390
though I only announced it on snapchat a

318
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:51,370
day before I also went to playlist DC

319
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:53,450
and almost got kicked out oopsies I

320
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:55,370
turned 18 this year and finally became a

321
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:56,450
legal adult which means absolutely

322
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:59,420
nothing because you guys know I don't

323
00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:00,650
really smoke party or drink but I did

324
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:02,150
choose to celebrate my birthday with all

325
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:03,470
of you guys at the Murphy store here in

326
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,130
California and it was absolutely

327
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,750
incredible

328
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:07,339
working with brands such as Murphy this

329
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,810
year has been such a huge honor and has

330
00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:11,060
made both my social media accounts grow

331
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:12,890
but also my knowledge of business it is

332
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:14,570
truly incredible to be working firsthand

333
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:16,190
and receiving products of some of the

334
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:17,390
most famous brands and beauty when I

335
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:19,310
couldn't even afford some of their

336
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:20,480
products a year ago I absolutely loved

337
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:21,920
working in all their products and you

338
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,450
guys are always hearing me to tell you

339
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,700
use coaches for tempers they loved your

340
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:27,440
purchase I even put it on a sweatshirt I

341
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,730
had an opportunity to model for a little

342
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,560
holiday campaign this year which was

343
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:31,640
super exciting my makeup was done by

344
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,990
lipstick Nick one of my all-time

345
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,790
favorite artists with the shoe and the

346
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:36,529
photos honestly turned out incredible I

347
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:38,240
was so happy to be the face of their

348
00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:39,410
palette and you can now catch me and all

349
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,940
my favorites and all the different more

350
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:42,800
free store locations which is such a

351
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:45,079
huge honor although it wasn't a

352
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,820
collaboration who really knows that 2018

353
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:47,800
may have in store

354
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:49,360
I also worked closely with Benefit

355
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,340
Cosmetics one of my all-time favorite

356
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,600
brands they took Laura and I and a ton

357
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:54,460
of other influencers to Necker Island

358
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,720
which is truly one of the most fun weeks

359
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:57,700
of my entire life

360
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,020
I would talk all about it but the amount

361
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:01,570
of adventures we have could literally

362
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:02,620
fit in one video alone a few weeks ago I

363
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:04,270
was asked me one of their celebrity

364
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:06,310

365
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:07,930
where me a few other influences and the

366
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:10,060
entire benefit team spent a week on a

00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:11,590
beautiful mansion in Lake Tahoe coaching

368
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:13,840
