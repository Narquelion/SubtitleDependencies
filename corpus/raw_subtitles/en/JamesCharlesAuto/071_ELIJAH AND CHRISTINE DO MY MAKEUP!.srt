132
00:06:58,119 --> 00:07:01,709
shall we

133
00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:04,569
let's do a little reveal here we go oh

134
00:07:01,709 --> 00:07:05,049
okay Elijah your lash it's like kind of

135
00:07:04,569 --> 00:07:11,709
on there

136
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:13,869
what is this my favorite person yes

137
00:07:11,709 --> 00:07:16,379
sister if the concealer labs the conceal

138
00:07:13,869 --> 00:07:19,269
it's definitely a good a good touch I

139
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:23,049
also love that you both want for wing

140
00:07:19,269 --> 00:07:25,089
though I was gonna say wing but take a

141
00:07:23,049 --> 00:07:26,829
little Jenner mines that's a generous

142
00:07:25,089 --> 00:07:28,839
it's like it's like you know like this

143
00:07:26,829 --> 00:07:35,199
that's a ruddy 7 got the long it's no

144
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:37,360
it's always in crop duster yeah this is

145
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,289
a good look I think yeah so normally I

146
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,610
would start with the benefit

147
00:07:38,289 --> 00:07:41,979
Porefessional what's Christine Dan

148
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:43,719
Elijah I just not at all I did not use

149
00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:45,999
that at all next to be that Make Up For

150
00:07:43,719 --> 00:07:47,469
Ever foundation stick which Eliza did I

151
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:51,179
did use that all over the thing is

152
00:07:47,469 --> 00:07:54,249
Christine did not do so next I would do

153
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:55,749
next I would do concealer and I'd put it

154
00:07:54,249 --> 00:07:57,849
underneath the eyes and then the

155
00:07:55,749 --> 00:07:59,079
forehead and on the chin so I knew that

156
00:07:57,849 --> 00:08:01,059
I did that right but just with the wrong

157
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:04,269
product next I would usually set my face

158
00:08:01,059 --> 00:08:04,989
using a powder the entire face need the

159
00:08:04,269 --> 00:08:06,729
one of you did this

160
00:08:04,989 --> 00:08:09,279
next I do is the benefit hoola bronzer

161
00:08:06,729 --> 00:08:11,529
to go on like my cheek area to and

162
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:15,459
forehead to like bronze me up like that

163
00:08:11,529 --> 00:08:17,829
my summer glow right no disappeared but

164
00:08:15,459 --> 00:08:24,219
is we're still probably really hot Coast

165
00:08:17,829 --> 00:08:24,909
us from our utility room on the

166
00:08:24,219 --> 00:08:27,830
Traveling Pants

167
00:08:24,909 --> 00:08:29,720
okay so because him sister

168
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:30,919
pants and then he was saying bronze and

169
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,029
it made me think of like getting a tan

170
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:34,190
and then it made me think of going to

171
00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:35,390
Greece and how Alexis Modell's character

172
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:37,430
goes to Greece of meets kosis and

173
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:38,690
Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants and

174
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:40,669
that's why it wasn't random

175
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:43,519
next I would do the eyeshadow so it

176
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:46,390
going with the palette palette palette

177
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,589
correct both sisters here definitely

178
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:50,930
succeeded in well let's get the Chi

179
00:08:48,589 --> 00:08:53,120
whose is better and then I would do

180
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:56,060
eyeliner normally so both wings are

181
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,260
definitely an adventure an adventure I

182
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:59,000
would call them an adventure I think

183
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:01,700
there's better I would say Christine's

184
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,260
it's probably a little bit more thin so

185
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:05,390
that's two point and it has a little bit

186
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:08,899
more shape to her whereas Elijah's is

187
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:11,690
more freeform right it's very it's very

188
00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:13,339
spirit like it's free spirit kind of it

189
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:16,250
does what it wants to then I would do

190
00:09:13,339 --> 00:09:18,110
mascara on the lashes edge Christine

191
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:20,630
decided that it'd be good for her to

192
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:23,540
start with that it makes no difference

193
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:25,190
I I would disagree so I think overall

194
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:27,470
should we like pick a winner

195
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:29,750
yeah both flaws no I think the losers

196
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:32,839
you know I think the loser is definitely

197
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:36,320
me never being honest here I feel like

198
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:38,990
allies are probably mess no look at his

199
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,520
cheek obviously you didn't win well it

200
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:42,800
was the blush moment she wanted to do a

201
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:45,079
little okay pizza lips was the lips also

202
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,970
a blush romantic the lips tanked the

203
00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:48,589
lips pertain to your whole genuinely

204
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:49,850
