00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:19,730
and for each question there is what we

66
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:21,110
like to call a sister sabotage that this

67
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:26,900
thing could be a challenge

68
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:30,590
it could be a challenge this was just

69
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:32,660

70
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:34,220

the first one and I'm a little shook cuz

72
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:38,420

have to take it for yourself and

79
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,500
basically in the end the viewers the

80
00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:52,489

136
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:59,889

a piece of wood oh okay good or bad um

140
00:06:05,649 --> 00:06:09,669
I'm not sure I guess let's to go and get

141
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:11,739
to the contours of my face I thought a

142
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:15,179
dry Beauty sponge was gonna be really

143
00:06:11,739 --> 00:06:18,849
hellacious I'm ready to move forward

144
00:06:15,179 --> 00:06:21,039
yes ready okay question number two says

145
00:06:18,849 --> 00:06:23,139
Fenty Beauty helped revolutionize what

146
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,999
it meant for brands to be inclusive yeah

147
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:26,860
name two foundation launches that

148
00:06:24,999 --> 00:06:29,069
weren't very inclusive in their first

149
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:34,869
launch

150
00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:37,419
tart f fe f i all i think of this lemare

151
00:06:34,869 --> 00:06:48,729
but it's not it's not that it's a tart

152
00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:51,610
and you know I will argue this though

153
00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:53,679
okay can we have like like messy spill

154
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:54,279
debate we got we can have a debate but

155
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:55,869
go ahead

156
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:59,349
how many shades did they come out with

157
00:06:55,869 --> 00:07:04,449
they came out with 40 since I did do a

158
00:06:59,349 --> 00:07:06,939
review on it yes okay but listen

159
00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:08,860
they came out with 40 and there was

160
00:07:06,939 --> 00:07:11,559
about 25 shades of the same shade

161
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:13,629
mystery which is why their foundation

162
00:07:11,559 --> 00:07:16,360
range was a flop and they then had to

163
00:07:13,629 --> 00:07:19,029
apologize an add 10 later so they did

164
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,079
add more but six months later no this is

165
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:20,979
the wrong group to have this

166
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:23,679
conversation

167
00:07:20,979 --> 00:07:25,360
six months later if you're that brand

168
00:07:23,679 --> 00:07:27,039
and you ever have that much money you

169
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,139
better bring in honey and they swap for

170
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:32,099
you but the formulas sickening and James

171
00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:32,099
one so here we go again

172
00:07:34,779 --> 00:07:41,529
I love concealer and I'm a brave I know

173
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:51,699
oh shoot I'm gonna get it on this one I

174
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:52,539

175
00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:54,519
this for myself

176
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:55,719
Oh what do you think white concealer

177
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:56,439

178
00:07:55,719 --> 00:07:59,220
nice to highlight

179
00:07:56,439 --> 00:08:01,680

luxurious audience OH

268
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:45,320
Oh 360 no reason why I know that is

269
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:47,060
because it was traumatizing to use and

270
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:49,670
that's how I got kicked off the peerless

271
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:50,959
oh I actually thoroughly enjoyed the

272
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:52,700
brushes but they were way too overpriced

273
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,110

274
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,550

370
00:18:54,360 --> 00:19:02,909
little question she said wait Britta

Fridays we were paying everybody just

374

00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:13,919
yesterday or on Tuesday for those of you

376
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:16,049
who do not know miss Tati over here

377
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,370
major inspiration to me an amazing

378
00:19:16,049 --> 00:19:20,129
friend as well but she's been uploading

379
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:22,169
five days a week on her channel for the

380
00:19:20,129 --> 00:19:23,669
past how many years five years cannot

381
00:19:22,169 --> 00:19:25,950
really we'll never be able to relate

382
00:19:23,669 --> 00:19:27,179
don't understand how that even works but

383
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:28,950
you just recently announced that you

384
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:30,990
were done doing that and you wanted to

385
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:32,730
take a step back which i think is so

386
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:34,230
incredible I've seen you went behind the

387
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:36,389
scenes in your work ethic it's literally

388
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:37,860
unmatched I would die if I had to

389
00:19:36,389 --> 00:19:39,389
produce five videos a week watching the

390
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:41,039
video as like both a fan and a friend I

391
00:19:39,389 --> 00:19:42,330
think was very very emotional but I'm

392
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,769
surely everybody at home watching that

393
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:45,960
it's been such crimes like would love to

394
00:19:43,769 --> 00:19:47,730
know more about like why I'm like how it

395
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:49,740
feels to even be like taking a little

396
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:51,960
bit of a step back - thank you you

397
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:53,669
already feel that is the sweetest um

398
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:56,039
yeah I do you know it was really

399
00:19:53,669 --> 00:19:57,990
exciting is getting a text saying hey

400
00:19:56,039 --> 00:20:00,419
let's film together and actually being

401
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:02,120
able to be like yeah yeah let's do it

402
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:05,129
and half the time and half the time

403
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:09,360
because normally I would shift from like

404
00:20:05,129 --> 00:20:11,840
filming to Halo back to filming going

405
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:14,050
through edits posting like it was just a

406
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,630
24/7 thing

407
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:19,450
and I mentioned in the video that James

408
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:22,300
and I are trying to have a baby we want

409
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:24,940
a family so you know maybe Westbrook is

410
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:27,100
I'll be the god sister god sister is

411
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:29,200
hopefully on the way the challenge with

412
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,760
that and like being hormonal and like

413
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,290
emotional and going through that and

414
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:36,010
five days a week I was like none of them

415
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:38,290
yeah I need to like de-stress be happy

416
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:39,490
and more joyful about it and honestly

417
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:41,140
the craziest thing about it is I'm

418
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:43,150
already feeling more refreshed and happy

419
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:46,540
to film and more creative and I'm like

420
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:49,960
wow that happened so fast like I was so

421
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:54,100
scared of it and then it was the best

422
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:55,810
choice ever be real for a minute I am

423
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:58,150
excited to actually be able to hang out

424
00:20:55,810 --> 00:21:00,850
with you more I don't mean our I know I

425
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:02,800
think like really I got so sucked into

426
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:05,170
that schedule and and that was like my

427
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:07,540
main commitment and I really felt truly

428
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:09,490
in my heart but if I stopped or slowed

429
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:10,990
down everything would fall apart I'll

430
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:13,360
stop you thought I'm just gonna ask how

431
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:15,190
does it be back band on your I could cry

432
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:19,000

00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:21,810

500
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:47,640
for you I just want you to review them

501
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:49,560
okay like you weren't my friend and give

502
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:52,080
me a full wear test I'm kind of over

503
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:53,790
people thinking that you can't do like a

504
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:57,050
real biased review with your friends

505
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:59,850
like listen I get it I love what I might

506
00:24:57,050 --> 00:25:01,950
know let's talk about that well I

507
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:03,840
obviously that video meant a lot to me

508
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:05,370
as like a friend but as a viewer I

509
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,630
thought it was so cool to literally

510
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:08,430
watch you sit there and say this is a

511
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:10,320
biased review and I think you know of

512
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:11,580
course the pds about it but for the most

513
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,690
part I did feel like a lot of the

514
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:14,790
comments were really really positive

515
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:16,440
this was an important moment for you it

516
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:18,390
was an important launch like I was not

517
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:20,640
gonna be the person you know being that

518
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:23,610
we are so close now I have history with

519
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:26,190
you to tear it apart and I knew that I

520
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:28,200
was gonna be a little bit biased so like

521
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:30,750
I felt why not just say that but

522
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:32,340
honestly like through and through as far

523
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:34,140
as palettes that I do reach for I do

524
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:36,120
reach for this quite a bit

525
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:38,640
voila and that always says something to

526
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:40,020
me when you have access to so much to

527
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,920
really see like what you're really

528
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:46,410
reaching for hmm just because I like the

529
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:49,410
versatility of it I don't do a lot of

530
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:51,120
bright so I kind of stay in the neutral

531
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:52,770
zone but then I like having like okay

532
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,000
yeah that's a creative or it has

533
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:55,920
something a little bit of something for

534
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,780
everybody yeah do you guys have a hard

535
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:59,550
time when you film to not like move

536
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:01,530
around to do your makeup because I'm

537
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:03,120

the way up and you'll see me like lean

539
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,670
