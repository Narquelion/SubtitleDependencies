I was like I have to give her a name you

67
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:42,410

68
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:44,269
title she was the name right i sat there

00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:45,620

know I need like something that's like

71
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:51,049
not too basic but basic yeah I was I

72
00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:54,230
came to life and she changed my life

73
00:02:51,049 --> 00:02:55,730
yeah she really did yeah it's like you

74
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:57,620
said you were 20 and before that you

75
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:59,180
were working a regular job right so

76
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:01,790
where are we even working before so I

77
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,870
was working at a cost in there oh and

78
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:04,700
like sometimes I don't have to bring

79
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:06,739
that all side of me and like she is like

80
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:09,530
very like my alter ego so she's just

81
00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:11,989
like kind of built inside me so you're

82
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:13,670
from Texas San Antonio San Antonio Texas

83
00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:15,920
okay I've never been to Texas before him

84
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:17,989
but I want to go so bad I love Texas so

85
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,700
much since I could be lit there mm-hmm

86
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:21,260
ready for some fun see you later mm-hmm

87
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,340
okay so autumn I know we first started

88
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,359
talking a few what we can see oh you

89
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:26,359
tell me that you had just ended up

90
00:03:23,359 --> 00:03:29,269
leaving at the call center job yes so I

91
00:03:26,359 --> 00:03:30,470
hated that job it wasn't like my career

92
00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:32,030
anything I wasn't gonna

93
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:34,850
I didn't pan I'm saying they're right

94
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:38,330
but yeah I kind of just took a leap of

95
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:40,310
faith and was like we just Joe so how

96
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:41,660
has doing tic toc then change your life

97
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,770
because obviously it's way different

98
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,810
than what it wasn't assuming a few

99
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:46,490
months ago yeah so I think the craziest

100
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:48,230
part is getting recognized in public the

101
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:51,320
craziest and like the best part I feel

102
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:55,070
yeah I go to like my local store and I

103
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:57,050
get recognized and I'm like what like it

104
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:58,910
still hasn't sunk in and I have millions

105
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:01,970
of followers on that platform right cuz

106
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:03,860
I I don't know I still I feel the same

107
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:05,780
exact same it's just I don't know I feel

108
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:08,300
like people expect me to like change in

109
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:09,890
some weird way I felt the exact same

110
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,910
well that's good it's good that like you

111
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:11,930
don't feel like anything is changing

112
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:13,580
because that means that you're a good

113
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:14,330
person on the inside and now this is

114
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:16,400
your first time in LA

115
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:18,230
huh yeah so I had never even been out of

116
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,580
Texas before what I've never been on a

117
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:22,220

boring yeah I had never been out of

120
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:30,650
Texas my first time on a plane so yeah

121
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:32,030
it's like being in LA has been so crazy

122
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:34,730
and there's just so many opportunities

123
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:35,990
ok so I want to know if you are a fan of

124
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:38,270
makeup what has been like your

125
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:39,530
experience with it in the past cuz you

126
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:42,500
only helped I think you only have like

127
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:43,880
one tick tock or Instagram photo op with

128
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,740
makeup on it's like green and pink

129
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,180
eyeshadow I'm using it in like my head

130
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,979
for some reason I haven't been doing

131
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:51,200
makeup for long I recently got into it I

132
00:04:48,979 --> 00:04:52,070
believe 2019 oh ok so only well sure

133
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,800
yeah

134
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:56,860
and so I had I was obviously inspired by

135
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:01,070
a lot of male makeup artists like you

136
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:03,080
Manny I'm so many yeah and so I had

137
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:04,610
remember I had gotten paid one day and I

138
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:07,010
was like you know what I have no bills

139
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:09,440
like this cheque let me go and go to

140
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:11,810
Alta and I spent almost $400 on like a

141
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,030
full face oh my god because I was like I

142
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:17,090
have to get enough stuff for like a full

143
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:19,669
face so I spent $400 and I went home and

144
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:22,040
I hated all of it like no I applied

145
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:24,890
everything and I looked crazy so I was

146
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:26,450
like what did you do I spent $400 and

147
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:28,250
now I hate it all but then I just kept

148
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:30,740
trying I was again YouTube videos I

149
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:33,590
ended up I wanted to get perfect my eyes

150
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:35,300
for sure I underestimated the face part

151
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:37,490
of the makeup process I think everyone

152
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:38,990
does yeah everyone does it seems like

153
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:40,850
it'd be so much easier but it's not

154
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:42,410
it takes a long time but like really get

155
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:44,450
happy with your babies yeah let's go

156
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:45,530
ahead and start some contour and this

157
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:50,930
time we're gonna be a little bit less

158
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:52,400
harsh okay how do think roses makeup

159
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:55,040
aside from the eyelashes even from about

160
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,410
um so the way it did it I pretty much

161
00:05:55,040 --> 00:06:00,530
took into consideration all the girls at

162
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:03,290
the high school in shade no and it's so

163
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:04,730
it's kind of like so unreal but it's

164
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:06,260
real because like you're not gonna walk

165
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:08,210
out in public and see some girl with

166
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,830
that much fun while yo you may walk out

167
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:11,150
and be like girl do you have that much

168
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,590
contour on you know anything yeah so

169
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:14,030
it's kind of like that exaggerated look

170
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:15,740
that I wanted to give her yeah she's

171
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:17,540
just that girl who just does the most

172
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,680
with everything okay so then what was

173
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:21,230
like the first moment that you knew you

174
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:23,000
had like something good going on it was

175
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:25,370
at one specific video that blew up yeah

176
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,140
so my slushie video was everywhere I

177
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:28,880
think you got a dollar yeah you got a

178
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:31,220
dollar so I can go get a slushie that

179
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,590
one for me kind of just it definitely

180
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:37,220
put us on the map she was on Twitter on

181
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:39,620

yeah okay okay let's do it let's grab

226
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:26,440
that Junior chose Exmoor pig mini

227
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:27,580
palette let's go some color alright you

228
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:30,070
guys are gonna start off with an M four

229
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:31,060
five six and dipping into coma notice

230
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:33,039
that's like a really popular on

231
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:35,020
tick-tock is a lot of craters posts like

232
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,150
literally like a few times a day whereas

233
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:40,029
on your page you don't post nearly as

234
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:40,570
often as that but all of your videos go

235
00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:42,099
viral

236
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:43,419
so what is your thought process behind

237
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:45,970
like one you both your videos are not

238
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:47,290
yeah so I kind of just film I try and

239
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:49,089
post the one in video every week it's

240
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:51,250
just cuz I feel I don't want people to

241
00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:52,570
think I'm kind of like trying to push

242
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,070
out a Content that's not even good

243
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:55,959
anymore so that's kind of why I don't

244
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:57,760
post like so consistently just because I

245
00:08:55,959 --> 00:09:00,279
feel like I want quality over quantity

246
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,570
and yeah always like said that since the

247
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:02,920
beginning do you think that make up

248
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:04,209
stuff it's like something that you want

249
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:06,339
to get more into especially on your

250
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:08,620
social media channels like coming up cuz

251
00:09:06,339 --> 00:09:11,080
of which I would love to see some videos

252
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:14,440
I would love to see some rum so makeup

253
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,940
videos to my sisters Otis a year you got

254
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,170
a dollar

255
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:19,930
for sure I kind of wanna incorporate

256
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:21,610
both of me myself like Adam yeah I know

257
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:23,589
so like I don't know I just feel like I

258
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:25,690
can create something so good with both

259
00:09:23,589 --> 00:09:28,120
of them yeah I had seen some comment

260
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:30,490
that said you should do a contour and

261
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:33,220
highlight duo like Pat oh yeah I was

262
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:43,389
like that's so iconic

263
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:45,160
Oh alrighty nice that is pretty much the

264
00:09:43,389 --> 00:09:46,959
ice not a person all complete we

265
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:49,360
literally just use the blue tones and it

266
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,689
the palate it looks so good

267
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,680
do you like it it's so good

268
00:09:51,689 --> 00:09:55,360
monochromatic moment alright you guys so

269
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,620
we're gonna go ahead and mirror that I

270
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,360
said onto the other eye and then we'll

271
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:00,250
be right back to do the mascara and

272
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:05,560
lashes is that because I think Rosa he's

273
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:06,819
a little bit of a lesson alright you

274
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,920
guys so we're about the bolt eyes done

275
00:10:06,819 --> 00:10:11,199
and it is now lashes time which I am a

276
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,939
so got excited more okay so I thought

277
00:10:11,199 --> 00:10:15,610
it'd be kind of fun because Adam loves a

278
00:10:12,939 --> 00:10:17,410
dramatic lash to actually use the lashes

279
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:19,000
that we had on earlier put them on

280
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:22,089
correctly I won't know where the heck

281
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,589
did the whole wonky laugh situation even

282
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:25,389
start from like cuz it was kind of like

283
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:26,800
that dramatic look like the [ __ ] she

284
00:10:25,389 --> 00:10:28,149
doesn't know what she's doing my kinda

285
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,399
like just getting out of the house ready

286
00:10:28,149 --> 00:10:35,470
to go she puts an eyelash upside down

287
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:36,970
you know okay I noticed time for lip

288
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:49,089
liner starts gonna go in with a classic

289
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:50,290
nude lip oh my god it hey you alright

290
00:10:49,089 --> 00:10:51,490
Adam the last question that I want to

291
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:54,579
ask you while I'm about to set your face

292
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:56,259
in place is how does it feel for you

293
00:10:54,579 --> 00:10:57,910
when you see other people making roasted

294
00:10:56,259 --> 00:10:59,350
videos or like impersonating you because

295
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:00,639
I feel like it's become such a huge part

296
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:03,100
of like the tic-tock culture at this

297
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:04,779
point yeah so I feel like the most joy

298
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,990
that I gather this is seeing everybody

299
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:09,430

00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:11,410
