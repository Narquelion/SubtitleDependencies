whole situation was very spooky but what

70
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,520
better way to do with the spooky

71
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,320

81
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:29,950

as you go I want some level like an

83
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,990
orange moment on the top

84
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,450

00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:37,150

00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:44,770
all of your launches and I'm definitely

91
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,820
excited about all of them I saw you

92
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:47,260
tweeting about this Halloween collection

93
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,970
and you were like really really pumped

94
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:50,380
about it yeah you want to talk about it

95
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:52,060
I mean as everybody knows I do all my

96
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:54,370
own like reveal it's like my snapchats

97
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,420
because at a certain point someone asked

98
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,620
me to like why don't you just have

99
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,120
someone take the videos for you and then

100
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,560
program but I'm like I like to do it

101
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,940
myself because I know how I want my

102
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,490
makeup to look and I know I can get the

103
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:05,620
best lighting driver so after I showed

104
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:08,320
people I just felt the love and the

105
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:10,690
response and I made me remember why I do

106
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,360
what I do yeah so it was a pretty cool

107
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:15,220
feeling and it kind of reminded me what

108
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,260
I used to feel like when I first started

109
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:18,970
I get really excited about things I work

110
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:20,500
for a very long time I work really hard

111
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:22,540
on and I put like so much love into

112
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,250
everything right and I'm super I'm like

113
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:25,990
a hundred percent involved in creating

114
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:28,090
the packaging if I want this little

115
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:30,280
thing spot gloss or I want this metallic

116
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:32,110
material what kind of like cardboards

117
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,850
used I have someone who helps them with

118
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:36,040
renderings but I don't have anyone that

119
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:37,390

120
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,820

rendering so yeah I'm just like really

124
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:48,340
involved so then when I finally show

people and they get excited about it it

126
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:51,760

play with me called a quintessentially

141
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:26,950
enough very themes for this video I

142
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:28,390
started on a Halloween actually almost

143
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:30,040
three years ago as well so buy for your

144
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:32,080
anniversary is coming up oh my god am I

145
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:34,540
did a skeleton luck - yeah this is

146
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,590
simple circle love that I was just

147
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:37,150
playing around with some makeup but I

148
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:38,330
had to save from being a few different

149
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:40,060
clients before and I

150
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:42,080
but myself for the first time in our

151
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:43,789
yeah I was kind of fun and I actually

152
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,080
left a decent - so I just encounter

153
00:06:43,789 --> 00:06:46,939
practicing it the first time I ever did

154
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,550
makeup is documented on Instagram so

155
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:50,659
literally every single time sighs

156
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:52,610
selling one day and like 10 years

157
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:54,110
they'll be able to literally pull yeah a

158
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:57,560
single time that I never wore makeup

159
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:58,879
it's like so crazy so it's just like a

160
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,159
really amazing journey from literally

161
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:07,460
just doing in my basement - no else and

162
00:07:01,159 --> 00:07:08,719
having it as a real job think sister if

163
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,430
you're not watching YouTube because

164
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:12,770
literally when I'm not working I'm

165
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,840
probably watching YouTube videos what is

166
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:16,819
like a typical day of sister Kylie Kylie

167
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,190
cosmetics pretty much takes up most of

168
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:22,219
my days and work on the weekends are

169
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:23,509
usually just me and stormy I try to

170
00:07:22,219 --> 00:07:25,909
spend as much time with her as possible

171
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:29,930
and then when I'm not spending time with

172
00:07:25,909 --> 00:07:32,060

one other name in mind but stormy always

221
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,200
felt like her name right when she was in

222
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:33,520
the womb it's almost like she chose her

223
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:36,400
name so then when they called me from

224
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:38,350

259
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:03,090
blessing to do what I love every day I

260
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:07,440
worked so hard I'm starting only a few

261
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:16,140
years ago crazy we're very close yeah

262
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:17,790
you're only two years older than me it's

263
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:19,590
just really inspirational to see that

264
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:21,030
someone so young working so hard and

265
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:22,500
just like doing that you better major

266
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:24,210
source of inspiration to me and I'm sure

267
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,260
a ton of other kids out there as well we

268
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:26,100
really want to work hard and just do

269
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,630
something for themselves I've obviously

270
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,460
done a few reviews on you and like on

271
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:30,600
Kim's collections dozen people always as

272
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:32,220
I'm sure you know are always commenting

273
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,150
stupid stuff like they don't do anything

274
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,950
they have no talent

275
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,660
you can business Abby is a talent it's

276
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:38,160
definitely a talent the comment is it's

277
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:40,140
so old at this point like everybody's

278
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,880
talents are different and in my opinion

279
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:43,590
being able to use your own name and

280
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,880
likeness in order to build a brand is

281
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:46,260
one of the best homes in the entire

282
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,790
world and like I will stand by that

283
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:49,050
until the end of time people do the same

284
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,130

I can see how hard you work and I know I

290
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:01,530
work so hard I could have been in the

291
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:03,390
same position and done it completely

292
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:04,560
differently and so could you right now

293
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,330
on top of that purple I want to layer a

294
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,620
little something over top we're gonna

295
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,760

concealer brush and just pop that right

298
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:14,940
on top of the cut crease that we've

299
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:18,079
already made just to intensify to make

300
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:21,569
it look a little bit more Matala

301
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:33,029
were you like an artist before makeup

302
00:12:21,569 --> 00:12:35,209

303
00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:36,959

304
00:12:35,209 --> 00:12:38,429

it like to the next level copper go home

308
00:12:42,809 --> 00:12:46,470
write down because honestly I never

309
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:48,569
really get crazy with my eyes like this

310
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:51,619
but I'm really serious like this is like

311
00:12:48,569 --> 00:12:51,619
crazy for your eyes yeah

312
00:12:51,989 --> 00:12:57,989
what's crazy for your eyes mmm a lot

313
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:59,519
more the mess but no I love it I think

314
00:12:57,989 --> 00:13:02,790
it looks super mom I would actually go

315
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,079
out like this but let's do it

316
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:06,449
so another skeleton today I need to

317
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:09,179
sketch out like the highlights first

318
00:13:06,449 --> 00:13:10,949
okay so then I can focus on the shadows

319
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:12,809
okay so I'm gonna use a white eyeliner

320
00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:14,670
pencil and I start right up above you're

321
00:13:12,809 --> 00:13:20,999
over here what is the craziest making

322
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:23,910
we've ever had on really probably

323
00:13:20,999 --> 00:13:27,529
speaking of a crazy makeup looks what

324
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:27,529
has been your worst red-carpet moments

325
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,980
[Music]

326
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:37,410
just changed so much I see photos of me

327
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:40,410
all day that's just like nah girl like

328
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:42,209
whatever but I don't care I'm also not

329
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:44,129
the type of person that a lot of people

330
00:13:42,209 --> 00:13:45,899
probably think I am except my true fans

331
00:13:44,129 --> 00:13:48,299
have seen me like looking like super

332
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:50,100
crazy out I don't really care like I

333
00:13:48,299 --> 00:13:51,689
leave the house every day not thinking

334
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,549
I'm Kylie really hmm

335
00:13:51,689 --> 00:13:55,649
like I I don't really feel like I have

336
00:13:53,549 --> 00:13:57,990
to leave the house in full like put

337
00:13:55,649 --> 00:13:59,699
together outfit and glam and I'm just

338
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:02,639
like I hope no one catches me they

339
00:13:59,699 --> 00:14:04,199
usually do I'm always crazy on the

340
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,060
streets but I can't think of one

341
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:09,770
specifically all I know is that my

342
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:11,810
change I wanted to catch out the teeth

343
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:13,220
on your lips did you have like a paper

344
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:14,990
makeup look that you've ever worn to a

345
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:17,270
red carpet or twin event before my

346
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:19,970
favorite makeup look was when I wore

347
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:22,730
teal hair long teal hair Arielle did my

348
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:24,230
makeup that's my favorite not because I

349
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:27,320
think it's the best we've ever done but

350
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:30,020
I think that started like how I like my

351
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,640
makeup done like we figured out my look

352
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:33,680
and then we perfected it alright we are

353
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:36,970
back and the highlights are all done I

354
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,970
was getting a little hot and steamy

355
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,310
we're gonna go to the shadows now just

356
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:42,080
because it comes to everything kind of

357
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:43,430
like backwards order because adding

358
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,420
weight over top a block is a lot harder

359
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:46,040
and the other way around

360
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:48,440
I'm actually just gonna lightly like

361
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,790
inner line I guess the black parts as

362
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:52,130
well because I'm actually gonna use the

363
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:53,780

settings Brian how does it like growing

384
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:43,310
up in the public eye in spotlight it has

385
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:46,880
like I mean I definitely think that it's

386
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:49,280
not for everybody and I was chosen to be

387
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,800
in this position cuz I feel like God

388
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:53,510
knows that I'm strong mm-hmm because a

389
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,660
lot of people just come even times I'm

390
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:55,660
like

391
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:01,310
really but I feel like it's just my life

392
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:04,430
like I don't know anything I don't know

393
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:06,860

00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:15,050
line or like right but if way back to

397
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:18,530
like if I didn't have my family

398
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:21,950

400
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:25,130
