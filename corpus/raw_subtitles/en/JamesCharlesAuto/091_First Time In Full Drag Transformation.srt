00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
hi sisters James Charles here and

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:04,620
welcome back to my youtube channel I

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,359
just want to go ahead and jump right

4
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,350
into the intro for today's video because

5
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:10,440
I've been wanting to do this for

6
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:11,670
literally so long now I am so excited

7
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,259
and I do think that this is probably

8
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:15,360
gonna be one of the longest videos that

9
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:17,220
I ever upload to this channel so saddle

10
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,550
up get ready because for today's video

11
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,840
we're doing my first ever full on Drive

12
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,400
transformation now you're probably

13
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,230
thinking sister James what are you

14
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,820
talking about we've seen you do Drive so

15
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,619
many times on Instagram and here in

16
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,330
YouTube and yes you're definitely not

17
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:31,260
wrong what I actually think is really

18
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,690
really cool and almost like a

19
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,190
sentimental part of this video is that I

20
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,450
started to make up three years ago now

21
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,399
and because of the fact that I started

22
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,200
on Instagram all of my looks are

23
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,300
actually documented in photo for you

24
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,100
guys to see including my chart makeup

25
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,780
the first ever time that I did jog was

26
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,910
probably about two years ago now and it

27
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,590
was this photo inspired by Raven a

28
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,850
legendary Queen from season two and

29
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:52,680
honestly should have been winner of

30
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,879
RuPaul's Drag Race as well as every

31
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,770
other time that I've done drawing after

32
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:57,480
that I will confidently say that through

33
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,910
a lot of mistakes a lot of misplaced

34
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,199
eyebrows and a lot of practice by drag

35
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:02,969
makeup abilities have definitely gotten

36
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,739
a whole lot better and of course they've

37
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:06,689
gotten some pretty nice wigs as well but

38
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,369
that's kind of about it I've been a

39
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:09,630
major fan of RuPaul's Drag Race and a

40
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:11,549
supporter of someone including that have

41
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,560
both been on the show and all for a very

42
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:15,720
very long time now the drag community

43
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,520
has influenced my personality sense of

44
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,040
humor and also makeup skills with

45
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,570
different tips and techniques so so so

46
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,830
much throughout the past three years and

47
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:25,229
I'm generally so honored to be in the

48
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,909
LGBTQ community with amazing drag queens

49
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:28,380
that being said though even though

50
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:30,090
drying and dry Queens have been such a

51
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,040
major source of inspiration to me at a

52
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,930
huge part of my life it is an artform

53
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,600
that I don't really know that much about

54
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:38,040
as an outsider and as a fan I have even

55
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,900
made the mistake and looking at drag

56
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,030
queens on stage looking beautiful and

57
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,470
fierce as just a man and a wig and a

58
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,780
dress absolutely killing it when in

59
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,310
reality there is so much more that goes

60
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,140
into actually being performance ready

61
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,820
with both the skills and putting the

62
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,960
look together so for today's video I

63
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,560
thought I'd be really really cool to

64
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,600
take a topic that I love and abso

65
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,369
but can be educated on because I'm

66
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,799
ignorant towards and really just take a

67
00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:02,929
full-on deep dive into the world to jog

68
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,299
and see what it actually takes to put

69
00:02:02,929 --> 00:02:07,189
together a go luck in time for a major

70
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:08,660
special event or performance I thought

71
00:02:07,189 --> 00:02:10,670
it'd be the perfect time to take on this

72
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:12,319
challenge because I'm actually flying to

73
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:14,480
New York very very soon to work on some

74
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:17,060
super-secret sister projects and while

75
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,709
I'm gonna be there coincidentally Drakon

76
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,989
New York City is going to be happening

77
00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:22,670
and what better place to try out being a

78
00:02:20,989 --> 00:02:24,500
dropping for the first time ever then at

79
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:25,819
Drakon a little convention filled the

80
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,739
dry Queens that I have loved and looked

81
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:28,819
up to for so long the only issues are

82
00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:30,950
that I'm currently in the process of

83
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:33,769
moving and then I leave for New York in

84
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:36,200
less than two weeks so this is gonna be

85
00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:38,329
quite the time crunch we have two weeks

86
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:41,150
to pull off this full-on Drive

87
00:02:38,329 --> 00:02:42,200
transformation can we do it let's get

88
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:45,350
started

89
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,350
[Music]

90
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,970
all right so we have two weeks until it

91
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:51,140
dry condi are actually happens I think

92
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,670
in order to have success in this I need

93
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:54,650
to split up my focus into four different

94
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:57,349
categories which I figured out are the

95
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:58,639
body the outfit the hair and the makeup

96
00:02:57,349 --> 00:03:00,590
and I think I actually need to hit them

97
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:02,600
in that order as well starting on for

98
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:04,340
the body because of course like the body

99
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,750
is gonna affect the fitting which look

100
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:07,489
back to the gown and then I just pick

101
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,810
the hair or based on the gown and then I

102
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:10,190
need to pick the makeup based on

103
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:11,359
everything altogether I think I

104
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,100
definitely need to pour most of my

105
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:15,170
attention into the body first because

106
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,950
that's gonna be by far probably the

107
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:17,840
hardest part of this entire

108
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:20,209
transformation I don't exactly have much

109
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,100
to work with you guys know from my

110
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:23,450
several accidental but picks that I post

111
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:25,100
it on snapchat there isn't a whole lot

112
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:27,350
there in order to give myself a little

113
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:29,209
bit more sister shape I'm really going

114
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:32,090
for that hourglass figure I need to get

115
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:33,739
two different things being padding and a

116
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:35,389
corset I'm not exactly sure how I'm

117
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:36,620
gonna do my padding yet which has me

118
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:38,780
very very stressed out but we're gonna

119
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:40,370
figure it out we always do but I do know

120
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,569
how I'm gonna do it my corset I reached

121
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:43,310
out to a ton of my drive friends and

122
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:45,139
conveniently as well the try guys which

123
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:46,489
are a huge channel here on YouTube just

124
00:03:45,139 --> 00:03:48,440
did a video last week where they got

125
00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:50,660
corset fitted so I reached out to the

126
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:52,459
same shop they're called what katydid

127
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:54,650
located in Burbank California and I have

128
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:56,569
an appointment in about 30 minutes from

129
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:58,700
now for a corset fitting I'm gonna go in

130
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:59,060
and get sister snatched so I'm gonna

131
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,980
call it

132
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:03,870
and let's head over and see how much of

133
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:20,980
a skinny legend I could be today

134
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:20,980
[Music]

135
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:30,470
[Music]

136
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,950
she's been waist training for about 30

137
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:37,460
years

138
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:38,900
whoa hundreds of styles of custom

139
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:41,690
courses and everything and we've kind of

140
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:43,310
a drive back to these several different

141
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:45,320
styles now the extremely high quality

142
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:48,080
through an everyday few years if you

143
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,700
want to yeah oh yeah we have a lot of

144
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,500
really famous drag performers that use

145
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:53,000
these as their base for their costumes

146
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,760
as soon as I talk to my designer about

147
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,560
mean of course I he's like um yeah it's

148
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,030
a wonderful place to start out find a

149
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,250
corset that works for you and there are

150
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:03,080
what really wonderful price okay so the

151
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:04,729
fitting is like this we take your

152
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:07,430
natural waist measurement no then we go

153
00:05:04,729 --> 00:05:10,570
four to six inches down and that wall

154
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:12,560
your versat size of your arm let's do it

155
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:16,910
we're gonna go through the mortician

156
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:19,400
we're dog look yeah oh yeah great great

157
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:21,850
to pad out I would I would try it on an

158
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,850
extreme

159
00:05:23,849 --> 00:05:29,279
this one will work for your your padding

160
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:31,559
okay I like this one for me because the

161
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:33,719
regular my tisha pushes on my ribs a lot

162
00:05:31,559 --> 00:05:35,339
and a young breathe as much young I get

163
00:05:33,719 --> 00:05:37,379
anxiety when I can't breathe

164
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:45,539
but this one it puts all the pressure on

165
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:47,849
my waist which I like oh yeah so you

166
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:49,619
have tons of padding room you can pop

167
00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:51,689
them in the butt you compat your hips

168
00:05:49,619 --> 00:05:55,139
out and you have tons of room for that

169
00:05:51,689 --> 00:05:56,789
then you have a teeny little waist yeah

170
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:58,759
and then once you pad it out it'll look

171
00:05:56,789 --> 00:06:06,629
even teeny

172
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:11,819
oh my lord this is crazy and so cool

173
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:12,990
250 186 perfect it was matched alright

174
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:14,939
so we just turned out of what Katie Did

175
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:16,439
literally everybody there was so beyond

176
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:18,209
eyes and so sweet I am ready to be

177
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:19,469
sisters snatched a little bit of the

178
00:06:18,209 --> 00:06:20,879
flops were sticking out of the science

179
00:06:19,469 --> 00:06:23,159
because they're normally meant for more

180
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:24,240
curvy people but that is what we have it

181
00:06:23,159 --> 00:06:25,499
padding forward I don't know how we're

182
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,419
gonna do this yet but we're gonna figure

183
00:06:25,499 --> 00:06:29,399
it out alright so now that our body is

184
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:31,409

217
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:38,950
yeah weeks ingress is been around for

218
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:40,800
about five years people knew about us of

219
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:43,000
kimchi and we've been involved basically

220
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,310
I've seen your weight on so many iconic

221
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,870
Queens are styling it's like insane and

222
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:48,940
I'm so excited to be working together

223
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:51,100
for this love obviously this is a very

224
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:52,900
very quick turnaround so I feel like we

225
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:57,370
should figure out what type of look we

226
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:58,510
want to do like now yes my final

227
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:10,030
planning session with my designer

228
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:59,500
earlier today it's going to be an old

229
00:08:10,030 --> 00:09:01,630
Hollywood be like super super it's like

230
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,700
a little yellow where we have platinum

231
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:11,350
which is a cooler tumbler that it's

232
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:13,150
almost why - I feel like the platinum is

233
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:15,310
gonna wash me out for Shore because it's

234
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:16,810
a white gown and I'm already pale and I

235
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:18,610
think they're great would be better for

236
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:20,290
a Down moment so I feel like the warm

237
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:22,050
tone original is definitely the way to

238
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:24,040
go

239
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:26,530

00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:44,600
probably not easy obviously we're gonna

295
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:46,910
handle the shoes tomorrow before I

296
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,860
hardly I can actually finally take a

297
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:52,250
little bit of a breath we did it we are

298
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:54,410

299
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:55,939

300
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:57,560

301
00:12:55,939 --> 00:13:00,320
to go and sister company we have our

302
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:01,639
Shake Shack for

303
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,400
we have a six-hour play ahead of us if I

304
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:09,950
had not been to New York in sick

305
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:11,240
quite the adventure let's do that we

306
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:13,730
define here to New York the thorny and

307
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,910
rock on earth now tomorrow and the one

308
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:18,860
less thing we have not gone yeah our

309
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:21,080
shoes so I'm currently at Steve Madden

310
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:23,000
and I'm having it slow because I just

311
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,920
ride on a size 9 which is my normal shoe

312
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,220
size and I could not get my left foot in

313
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:29,810
and my right foot was slipping so I've

314
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:32,270
now gone conclusion that if I want to be

315
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:34,220
a woman I have to wear to two sizes that

316
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:36,200
are literally a completely different so

317
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,940
I am NOT trying an 8 and a half on my

318
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,300
right foot at a nine and a half on my

319
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:40,300
left foot

320
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:49,620
and I'm really gonna buy two different

321
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:53,250
pairs of shoes that no overwatch

322
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:56,490
hello it is currently 8:52 p.m. JA Ronn

323
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:58,850
is now in t-minus 14 hours I have

324
00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:00,840
everything that I need but I am still

325
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:05,550
really really nervous for tomorrow and

326
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:07,560
I'm not exactly sure why I think that I

327
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:09,150
have my look altogether but the one

328
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,430
thing that I'm really missing before

329
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:13,980
this whole video is like a lesson on how

330
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:15,240
to like actually be a drag queen and I

331
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:17,250
think that because I've been planning

332
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:19,200
all this so quickly and because I just

333
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:21,300
moved and because now I'm traveling that

334
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,440
it kind of slipped my mind but that was

335
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:25,020
a really important thing that I should

336
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,700
not have skipped over so I do have a few

337
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:29,310
friends that I know are in Thai way now

338
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:30,720
for the actual convention tomorrow so I

339
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:33,360
think I'm going to do cross my fingers

340
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,670
and send out a few texts and pray that I

341
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,140
can get somebody over here tonight to

342
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:38,850
talk to me and hope we hope they call me

343
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:40,290
nerves also talk to you guys it's all

344
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:42,060
because I think obviously I'm trying

345
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:43,050
this out for the first time but it'd be

346
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,250
really cool to actually hear the

347
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,780
perspective of somebody that does it for

348
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,730
a living but doesn't every single day

349
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:49,350
that it's great at this and to maybe

350
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:51,510
speak on what it's like to be a what

351
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:53,130
these are grateful to me and to anybody

352
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:56,130

353
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:58,020

00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:28,500
to kind of like sit down and talk

367
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:34,290
together about tomorrow because tomorrow

368
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:35,970
is New York City yeah I am so nervous

369
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:37,650
and you've always been a really really

370
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:38,970
great friend and mentor implyin even

371
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:40,230
I've only done driving a few times I

372
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:41,360
thought I'd be really great for us to

373
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:43,040
like sit down together

374
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,230
to talk about like the whole job process

375
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,610
because as I told you I'm doing a penny

376
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:50,059
where I do like my first name ever in

377
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:51,499
fall on track and I thought like doing

378
00:15:50,059 --> 00:15:52,699
John Deere extending as I first like

379
00:15:51,499 --> 00:15:54,559
public appearance could have a really

380
00:15:52,699 --> 00:15:56,540
fun and fresh but now I'm like really

381
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:57,889
nervous about it too like a lot of

382
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:59,179
different reasons I thought like it'd be

383
00:15:57,889 --> 00:16:01,100
best to get it by someone who's like

384
00:15:59,179 --> 00:16:03,139
working in the fields I'm like doing it

385
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:05,629
really well too okay see we're gonna

386
00:16:03,139 --> 00:16:08,779
have to like Dean nervousness eyes you

387
00:16:05,629 --> 00:16:10,850
because I ever know if it's a word but

388
00:16:08,779 --> 00:16:13,279
the thing about it is that I think drag

389
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:16,489
is all about confidence yeah

390
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:18,679
when you're in that Juche yes you have

391
00:16:16,489 --> 00:16:19,819
to just feel it like you don't know what

392
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:21,559
insecure dragons

393
00:16:19,819 --> 00:16:23,769
you're gonna shine no matter what right

394
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:26,540
and you're really good at makeup I saw

395
00:16:23,769 --> 00:16:28,160
you did this one transformation it was

396
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:29,569
the first transformation you did where

397
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,619
you said that you were going for a very

398
00:16:29,569 --> 00:16:33,110
natural look

399
00:16:30,619 --> 00:16:35,929
yes it was really good and it was it was

400
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:38,360
just the perfect blend of natural and

401
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:40,160
like the stereotypical like drag makeup

402
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,799
if it's anything like that that you're

403
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:46,399
doing I can imagine that everything else

404
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:47,779
is gonna be just like in order to like

405
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,949
pull this actually off I've been working

406
00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:50,509
with a lot of like the industry

407
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:52,850
professionals and like the top of the

408
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:55,189
top to hope I look together

409
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:57,169
um Casius adventure asks and it wakes

410
00:16:55,189 --> 00:16:58,910
and grace in my hair and then wrinkle

411
00:16:57,169 --> 00:17:01,069
into my jewelry and then I do my makeup

412
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:02,480
I'm not the best of the best but I have

413
00:17:01,069 --> 00:17:06,079
pretty zit with a blending brush I will

414
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,789
say so it's not really the look that I

415
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,860
am worried about because I know that I'm

416
00:17:07,789 --> 00:17:12,139
actually in good hands I'm more worried

417
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:13,970
about like the drag community because I

418
00:17:12,139 --> 00:17:15,679
felt like not the best relationship with

419
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:18,180
the drag community in the past and I'm

420
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,980
really scared because the dry community

421
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:21,570
people that I look up to a lot like I've

422
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,950
been watching drag race that balding

423
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:24,330
dark beans on social media literally

424
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:25,170
like extend season and from way

425
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:27,030
beforehand

426
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:28,380
I've got so many that my voice looked up

427
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:31,140
to so many of them including you out

428
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:32,760
there Santos that's before and it's kind

429
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:35,070
of scary because although I love a lot

430
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,450
of people I know for a lot of them the

431
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:38,490
feeling isn't mutual

432
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:39,780
which is fun but it's a little bit of a

433
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:42,600
scary thought because it's a community

434
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:43,980
that I respect and by doing driving for

435
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:50,430
the first time I don't want to walk in

436
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:53,100
there and disrespect anybody we'll be

437
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:55,350
fine because honestly drag is very

438
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:58,020
inclusive especially in a safe space

439
00:17:55,350 --> 00:18:00,090
like Drakon you will be respected and

440
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:02,490
it's just like I think about everybody

441
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:04,500
does drag technically you've been doing

442
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:06,690
drag right celebrities you drag all the

443
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,970
time nicki minaj lady gaga like i

444
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:11,910
there's so many different ways to look

445
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:14,310
at drag it's not just like assist mail

446
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:16,170
and address sometimes it's just like

447
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:17,700
James Charles doing makeup

448
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:19,560
that's your drag that's your drive

449
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,810
nobody can tell you different but if

450
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:23,550
people don't support you from the drag

451
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:25,800
community those are just little pieces

452
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:28,980
they can really like get over themselves

453
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:30,630
because you are a person and we're all

454
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,220
people in the community I support you

455
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:34,320
and I know a lot of other people do

456
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:36,810
support you there as well so you will be

457
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:39,210
welcome and you know you're gonna have

458
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:41,130
fans there as well people who are going

459
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:42,570
to be like going but nanos when they see

460
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:43,320
you I hope there will be some sister

461
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:46,380
service where I haven't actually

462
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:50,670
announced that I'm coming yet so sister

463
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:52,620
surprise I don't know who's gonna be

464
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:55,800
there what is going to be like the

465
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:57,900
hardest part about being a job tomorrow

466
00:18:55,800 --> 00:19:00,320
the worst three things about being a

467
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:02,610
drag in my opinion to me are one

468
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:05,430
blotting you have to touch up your

469
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:07,530
makeup very frequently especially when

470
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:10,020
people want to take pictures like it's

471
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:12,690
very handy to have someone who has a

472
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:14,340
touch-up near you or even just like for

473
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:16,470
the girls on the go have a little powder

474
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:18,660
puff in your paranoids do so that one's

475
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:20,040
taken care of already girl you don't

476
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:23,670
want to look like a oil pit in the pigs

477
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:25,050
and then also the feet walking in heels

478
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:27,900
all day when you're not used to wearing

479
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:29,210
heels by this point I have hoes I am

480
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,800
basically a horse

481
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:33,440
I'm used to it that's what I'm most

482
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:36,300
scared about I will say number three

483
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,880
would have to be the end of the day

484
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:40,170
being in drag all day is so different

485
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,460
from being in drag

486
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:42,930
all night when you're in driving all day

487
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:45,450
the lighting especially if you're

488
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:47,230
wearing contacts and lashes it just like

489
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:50,350
makes your eyes tired and heavy

490
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:52,539
and then when it's time to get out of

491
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:55,330
drag it's like you slowly start peeling

492
00:19:52,539 --> 00:19:57,100
at all like a second and third skin and

493
00:19:55,330 --> 00:20:00,070
then you kind of just look at it and

494
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:02,200
you're just like how am i alive you're

495
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:04,090
gonna be so tired your feet or the VM

496
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,669
pain and you're gonna be like how am i

497
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:09,220
alive but while you're doing it the

498
00:20:06,669 --> 00:20:11,200
fantasy is still turned on yeah that it

499
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:11,970
just doesn't matter like except the

500
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,070
shoes remember

501
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:16,090
break some flats oh that's gonna be hard

502
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:17,919
so speaking of getting like your

503
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:19,480
signature look all together the one

504
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,100
thing that I've noticed throughout doing

505
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,720
this transformation today and obviously

506
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:25,929
of course I am working with on the top

507
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,580
of the top this is very expensive it

508
00:20:25,929 --> 00:20:29,500
does cost money usually to be beautiful

509
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:30,940
but drawing on a budget is something as

510
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,260
well I guess my question for you is like

511
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:34,149
obviously I guess that gets blurred you

512
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:35,590
onto a bigger platform where anyone to

513
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:37,389
get tons of pigs but your boys book

514
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:39,880
dialog like watching before put some on

515
00:20:37,389 --> 00:20:42,190
your stories seems it was so amazing but

516
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:43,630
beforehand everybody's kind of like a

517
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:45,370
queen on a budget just like any others

518
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:47,049
you have to buy materials store on your

519
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:48,399
mark warm what advice would you give to

520
00:20:47,049 --> 00:20:50,080
smaller creeks that want to start out

521
00:20:48,399 --> 00:20:53,470
doing drugs and how does drive on a

522
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:55,840
budget really work for me before I was

523
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:58,809
given the platform of drag race I had to

524
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,100
learn to make everything myself that was

525
00:20:58,809 --> 00:21:02,380
the real way to stay on the budget is

526
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:03,970
you want to look nice but as nice as you

527
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:05,710
want to look the also have to like save

528
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:07,750
the money right you're not getting paid

529
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:09,970
enough to look the way you look you can

530
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:12,100
go to the club and even if I did my own

531
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:13,389
wig I had to pay maybe fifty bucks for

532
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,919
the wig and then it's like the ten

533
00:21:13,389 --> 00:21:17,409
dollars for the hairspray and then the

534
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:19,510
brush and the column the dress was maybe

535
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:22,210
a forty dollar dress I got off the block

536
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:24,610
but I still bought a $20 pack Oh mr.

537
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:26,620
Oscar Ryan shows 2-digit up yeah you

538
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:29,980
know the makeup the shoes I'm a size 14

539
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:32,830
my feet can fit into canoes like little

540
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:34,600
boat find the way to learn to do

541
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:37,090
everything yourself yeah that's the hard

542
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:40,179
thing because showing is not easy doing

543
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:42,850
hair is annoying unless you really have

544
00:21:40,179 --> 00:21:45,100
the patience and the time girl now when

545
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:46,480
I get my wig made by Gloria from wigs

546
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,340
and grace like I'm just like thank you

547
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,720
for saving my life and making me look

548
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:56,480
like a trout like

549
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:57,680
catfish more like angelfish Oh majestic

550
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,970
I guess my last question for you is if

551
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,410
you kind of already it slightly touched

552
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:02,300
on this but just to give like an overall

553
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:04,250
answer for myself and for any other

554
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:07,190
young kids out there who want to try out

555
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:09,140
dry what did the best he said overall I

556
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:12,290
think the best advice for anybody is

557
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:15,350
really just know the reason you're doing

558
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:17,990
drag or find the reason through drag

559
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:19,610
itself because for some people drag is

560
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:21,470
their art form for some people who are

561
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:23,540
fond of dragons their medium to show

562
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:25,460
their talents and for some people it's

563
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:27,380
to help them find themselves some people

564
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:29,750
discover their trends to drag some

565
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:33,110
people discover who they are for me drag

566
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:37,580
is very therapeutical so I think the

567
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:42,830
biggest advice is to use drag however

568
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:44,720
you can to help yourself and help yeah

569
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:46,640
but like also if you can't help yourself

570
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:50,090
first you'll never be able to help other

571
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,920
people so I used to be like super insane

572
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:53,510
with it like I had so much anxiety and

573
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:56,120
so much depression and you know teenage

574
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:58,760
angst idea and I started doing drag and

575
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:01,340
I did slowly like kind of picked myself

576
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:04,640
up and I didn't have anybody around me

577
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:07,190
and I just kind of found a person in me

578
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,740
and I learned to love myself and I took

579
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:11,300
that message and I started to teach it

580
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:13,280
to other people so when I see like

581
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:14,480
Queens who you know may not look the

582
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,460
best or like look like they don't have

583
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,110
the funds I never sit there make fun of

584
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:19,520
them or be like oh wow because you don't

585
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:20,720
know where people come from right even

586
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,820
if like they don't look their best

587
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,160
instead of saying something like oh look

588
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:27,530
at her like she looks busted going up to

589
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:29,570
them and just saying hi introducing

590
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:31,880
and you know saying like I'm happy

591
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:34,130
you're doing this because anybody who's

592
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,570
trying to drag deserve some type of

593
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:38,540
recognition and everyone has to start

594
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:40,490
somewhere as oh yes like people think

595
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:42,230
that you wake up overnight and you're

596
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:45,170
just like the glam squad and you're

597
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:46,340
decide oh yeah it's like girl that's why

598
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:47,690
I was like nervous for this video too

599
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:49,010
because I'm obviously very blessed and

600
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:53,150
privileged to be able to work with the

601
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:55,250
team so I really appreciate getting your

602
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:57,470
acceptance weren't an issue for a very

603
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:58,970
very long time and it's my problem like

604
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:00,710
trying out driving a little baby driving

605
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:03,110
for the first time to like being the

606
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:05,420
superstar Queen I think people will see

607
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:07,670
what you're doing and will see that

608
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:10,910
you're using your platform to also like

609
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:12,350
further what you learned and they will

610
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:14,720
learn from that as well so I think that

611
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:16,820
what you're doing is cool it is risky

612
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,610
because like I know why you're nervous

613
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:20,750
right but I guarantee people are gonna

614
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:22,880
look at this and they're gonna think

615
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:24,230
that you're brave and they're gonna

616
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,980
think that it's cool and they're gonna

617
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:26,330
want to try it too

618
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:28,010
well thank you so much to super joining

631
00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:02,540

632
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:05,090
my alarm is still on somehow but it's

633
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:06,980
10:30 here in New York my timezone

634
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:10,370
literally to not stress on my phone and

635
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:13,580
now I'm 2 hours late good morning

636
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:18,200
it's 11:00 a.m. this is not good I'm so

637
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:19,370
mad like I cannot believe I'm gonna

00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:22,640
start off with looing dollar of my

639
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:25,250
eyebrows because I have man eyebrows and

640
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,510
I need to not have those today so flat

641
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:27,770
that's what we want

642
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:28,580
so once the glues like on there and

643
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:30,950
brushed up a little bit I'm actually

644
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:32,780
gonna take a wet washcloth and just go

645
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:34,190
over some of those edges really really

646
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:36,530
lightly just to kind of blend them in it

647
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:37,820
to my nostrils again so now we need the

648
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:39,380
glue to dry before we move on to the

649
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:40,220
next layer what do we do to make them

650
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:45,080
dry you ass

651
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:48,050

652
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:49,460
source ass apparel hog so now that my

653
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:51,080
brows are both glued down and basically

654
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:55,550
almost I am is gonna take my favorite

655
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:57,380
loose powder and grab quite a lot of it

656
00:25:55,550 --> 00:26:00,440
and just a powder puff and I'm going to

657
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:02,570
press that right over top of the brow to

658
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:04,580
lock them in place and also to put any

659
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:07,250
remaining powder inside of any little

660
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:08,060
gaps just make sure they're super super

661
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:09,920
smooth

662
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:11,780
approximately three videos ago now you

663
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:13,280
guys all heard me say color corrector

664
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:15,200
usually stupid I have never color

665
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:17,060
corrected in a million years guess that

666
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,790
I'm about to do call it cracked because

667
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:21,170
I am a man my beard is showing a lot for

668
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:22,430
some reason today in the last several

669
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:24,200
weeks I need to get laser hair removal

670
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:25,280
right now so we're getting starting off

671
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,350
the foundations hey I'm gonna grab my

672
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:29,780
kryla TV paint stick so this one is in

673
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:30,680
the shade NB which is not my shade I'm

674
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,910
gonna go over top of this with

675
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:34,760
Foundation and they're very short a

676
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:37,040
second but this is the a super intense

677
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:39,920
full coverage foundation like literally

678
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:43,240
it's like cement so what I'm gonna do is

679
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:43,240
go like this

680
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:51,299
now this looks disgusting so I'm gonna

681
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,110
take my to pay for this a foundation

682
00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:54,120
which you guys know is my all-time

683
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:55,919
favorite and go over time for that so it

684
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:57,390
looks less crazy so now I need to

685
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:59,070
highlight my face and when it comes to

686
00:26:57,390 --> 00:27:01,080
drag makeup obviously drives all of a

687
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:02,490
high-contrast so instead of grabbing a

688
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,919
concealer what I'm going to do is grab a

689
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:06,360
white foundation this is the Krell on TV

690
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:08,760
paint stick once again but this is in

691
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:10,440
the shade at 0-0 and the stuff is

692
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,940
actually really really bomb I love using

693
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:18,690
this and I'm just going to curl like

694
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:19,919
this okay so normally I'm without my

695
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:22,049
face in place right now but I think I'm

696
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:23,730
actually gonna do my eyebrows first so I

697
00:27:22,049 --> 00:27:25,470
can powder over top of them to lock them

698
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:26,580
in I normally would never do this I

699
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:28,380
don't know why I would take a rest on a

700
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:30,500
day like this but we're gonna do it all

701
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,500
right

702
00:27:33,529 --> 00:27:37,919
now as for the jawline I'm going to

703
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:39,270
contour up my jaw as usual just really

704
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:41,669
chelsa out there because we don't want a

705
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:43,230
double chin but when it comes to the

706
00:27:41,669 --> 00:27:44,909
corners of my jaw line we're gonna do

707
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:47,640
something sad then I'm gonna take my big

708
00:27:44,909 --> 00:27:49,890
round fluffy brush this is the m5 27 and

709
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:51,570
dip into that same middle tone shade a

710
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:54,059
little bit but mostly into the kind of

711
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:56,520
left or caramel shade and I'm gonna use

712
00:27:54,059 --> 00:27:59,039
this as like a bronzer to marry together

713
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:01,080
my natural skin tone and the contour

714
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:03,000
shade just make everything blend really

715
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:04,860
seamlessly low-key happy with how I'm

716
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,120
looking so far so now we're gonna move

717
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:08,130
on to the eye makeup so I'm gonna do

718
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:10,049
first is grab one of these weird cards

719
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:11,970
at the hotel has in here and we're to

720
00:28:10,049 --> 00:28:13,919
rip it in half and I'm gonna use these

721
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:16,830
to actually frame out my winged liner

722
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:18,990
today it makes this so much easier ten

723
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:20,370

and I'm gonna use this I'm gonna blend

731
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:34,970

732
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:37,790
inner corner and I'm gonna pull it up

733
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:39,290

00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:54,760
I'm gonna press it in there and I'm

740
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:57,200
gonna go right in my crease and blend

741
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:59,030
I'm gonna pull all the way out to the

742
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,670
edge with that same color I'm going to

743
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:04,460
pull it down into that outer corner as

744
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:06,350

745
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:07,910

make sure they're nice and blended out

749
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:18,470
and then with the slightest bet just

750
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:21,400
gonna go right in that just to really

751
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:21,400

00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,660

waterline this I shape is definitely

783
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:43,230
very inspired by a farrier she's

784
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:45,210
obviously on my ultimate favorite queen

785
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:46,650
but I really having white in this inner

786
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:48,300
corner right here because it just opens

787
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:50,160
up the eye and makes it look so much

788
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:51,540
bigger and very doll like what you guys

789
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:53,190
know are definitely my all-time favorite

790
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:55,080
techniques to do during it even like my

791
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:58,500
regular makeup style I just like make

792
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:59,700
myself look like a so just let the upper

793
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:03,720
lash line hits but whenever we go into

794
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:04,890
the white or just especially the lower

795
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,330
region as well you guys know I

796
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:08,220
definitely have very very sensitive eyes

797
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:11,190
and then like contacts and with all the

798
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:12,480
lashes and on top of being sick the last

799
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:14,700
thing that I want is my liner like

800
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,440
running around or jumping into this area

801
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,850
then without popping brushing that dark

802
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,620
front from before this question blend

803
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:21,690
out the lower lash so I end up below the

804
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:23,640
new lower lash and that we just created

805
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:26,040
and making sure to carry it right up

806
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:27,270
into the upper way so we pretty much

807
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,800

808
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:30,450

904
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:27,110
was like oh that's bone like there's no

905
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:53,390
way it just for the paper or tissue this

906
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:54,560
is not New York City we're just calm

907
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:56,360
down definitely a little bit now that I

908
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,710
feel super super confident beautiful I

909
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,970
just hope that I don't fall over at this

910
00:36:57,710 --> 00:37:00,380
point but I've been texting a lot of my

911
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:01,090
favorite greens this morning I'm gonna

912
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:03,250
go to

913
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:04,760
and there should be a really incredible

914
00:37:03,250 --> 00:39:13,320
experience so let's go

915
00:37:04,760 --> 00:39:16,429

916
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,429
[Applause]

917
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:22,070

my hair is still on my dress is still on

922
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:31,370

gonna head back to the hotel and D Drive

926
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,500
and take all this off because I

927
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:41,840
literally feel like I'm about to die

928
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:43,220
today was so much work and I want to

929
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:45,410

guys in a few shots oh my god I've never

933
00:39:49,310 --> 00:40:21,680
been in more pain in my entire life

934
00:39:50,420 --> 00:40:25,570
my okay I'm glad my skin is still alive

935
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:25,570
you're dying for that corset to come off

936
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:29,750
now I tied this really tight so just

937
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:43,010

938
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:50,290

939
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:53,060
I'm trying room turn around turn around

940
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:54,620
what does it look like you look like the

941
00:40:53,060 --> 00:41:06,230
predator I don't know that's the only

942
00:40:54,620 --> 00:41:09,250
way I can describe this back my toes

943
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:09,250
hurt so much

944
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:16,900
oh my god this has been the longest day

945
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:17,590
of my entire life I look disgusting like

946
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:19,360
I'm scared

947
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:20,470
hello my normal makeup I can keep on

948
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:25,030
filling a few hours during the day I

949
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:26,860
like get over that this no I can't today

950
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:31,150
was insane

951
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:34,750
like absolutely insane I was so nervous

952
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:36,880
you know there's like a lot of things

953
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:38,650
that I was worried about my outfit my

954
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,210
hair my makeup looking good because my

955
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:44,590
drag makeup has definitely been quite

956
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:46,750
the roller coaster for me my shoes which

957
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:48,610
obviously did not exactly end up working

958
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:49,750
out but you know what it's okay I took

959
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:50,950
them off there were a lot of other

960
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:52,450
creams that has their shoes off it's a

961
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:53,770
little walking around in slippers or

962
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:55,480
barefoot which I thought was so iconic

963
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:57,580
so I definitely was not the only one

964
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:58,750
that wanted to go for the talent but the

965
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:00,610
thing that I was most nervous about what

966
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:01,750
we're all was actually meeting so many

967
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:03,310
these things that have looked up to

968
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:05,350
forever because of the fact that I don't

969
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:06,730
exactly have the best reputation in the

970
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:08,320
chart world it's been a community that

971
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:09,880
I've loved forever but I've really tried

972
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:11,590
to stay away from in order to avoid

973
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:13,180
trauma just because it's something that

974
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:14,830
happened in our own two years ago with

975
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:16,420
and me cutting a line and a security

976
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:17,620
guard very very well that's right that I

977
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:19,270
don't really need to get into but it was

978
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:20,920
a complete misunderstanding and

979
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:22,570
now a lot of the drug fans don't like me

980
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:25,270
so that's great every single Queen that

981
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:26,920
I read today was literally you so beyond

982
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:28,510
nice I'm gonna answer some of the photos

983
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,800
here with the creeps that take photos

984
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:31,210
with and they were also incredibly

985
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,410
supportive and how does such nice things

986
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:34,390
that's they have it my first time in

987
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:35,980
Iraq so many the Queen's actually didn't

988
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:39,310
recognize me at first until I said my

989
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:40,690
sister and then they were like oh my god

990
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:42,580
what just watching that reaction was

991
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:43,900
actually so incredibly cool so many of

992
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:45,100
them said the way make up look beautiful

993
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:46,810
though they did not recognize me which

994
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:48,100
is definitely a good thing because it

995
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:50,470
means I did a good job of camouflaging

996
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:52,660
myself and becoming a sister superstar

997
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:54,250
at Rockwood I was also able to meet so

998
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:56,440
many of you sisters as well was just

999
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:57,670
always so crazy to me I did not notice

1000
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,840
that I was going to draw a gun obviously

1001
00:42:57,670 --> 00:43:00,430
because they wanted this whole video to

1002
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:04,180
be like a little bit of a sister

1003
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:05,800
surprise so surprise but so many of you

1004
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:07,480
guys have found me right away after I

1005
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:09,460
posted a snapchat my hotel room this

1006
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:10,930
morning and my finished look and we

1007
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:13,510
liberation up the convention time which

1008
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:15,160
is [ __ ] what I thought that I already

1009
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:16,750
had like the absolute highest level of

1010
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:18,160
respect for John Queens before even

1011
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:20,050
going into this video but let me tell

1012
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:22,690
you that bar has been raised

1013
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:24,250
literally like through the roof although

1014
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:25,830
I had so much fun today this is probably

1015
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:28,570
one of the most physically challenging

1016
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:31,210
experiences I have ever had in my entire

1017
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:35,080
life wearing that corset all day long is

1018
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:36,609
so incredibly painful my back literally

1019
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:40,210
looked like it was about to turn purple

1020
00:43:36,609 --> 00:43:41,560
and like fall but literally like it was

1021
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:43,450
so hard to breathe in the Walker on the

1022
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:44,890
entire day working with sister Alex for

1023
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:47,050
the gala wasn't so much fun because he's

1024
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:48,580
moving so talented and I think for next

1025
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:50,859
time I do drug I am probably am NOT

1026
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:52,720
Quinn to get a gown as beautiful as I

1027
00:43:50,859 --> 00:43:55,030
looked walking around with a train all

1028
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:56,859
day was so hard

1029
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:58,359
spent so much money on that gown and

1030
00:43:56,859 --> 00:44:00,070
every penny and that was worth it but

1031
00:43:58,359 --> 00:44:01,630
the entire bottom of it is covered with

1032
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:03,609
footprints from people stepping on all

1033
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:07,030
day long so definitely need a body suit

1034
00:44:03,609 --> 00:44:09,490
for the next and the shoes let me tell

1035
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:10,840
you about the shoes apparently I learned

1036
00:44:09,490 --> 00:44:12,940
through this lesson that my feet are two

1037
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:14,859
very different sizes great did not know

1038
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:16,810
that how I went 19 years without packing

1039
00:44:14,859 --> 00:44:18,520
in this now I don't know but apparently

1040
00:44:16,810 --> 00:44:19,470
it's not be looking for a pair of white

1041
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:21,300
high heels

1042
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:22,920
so and now we know aside from the

1043
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:26,280
physical pain ups in a little bit this

1044
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:29,100
experience has been so much fun and I am

1045
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:30,240
so beyond glad that I did it it's truly

1046
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:31,620
one my favorite experiences that I've

1047
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:33,330
had to take to sink everybody walk

1048
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:35,310
around and their wigs and makeup and

1049
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:37,500
crazy hair and outfits expressing

1050
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:38,940
themselves like what a beautiful and

1051
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:40,680
amazing thing this has been such an

1052
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:41,880
incredible and eye-opening experience

1053
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:43,770
for me because obviously I've done drag

1054
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:45,600
so many different times on Instagram but

1055
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:47,010
