1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,810
I sisters James Charles heard welcome

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:10,530
back to my youtube channel you guys

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:11,880
sister yet is rocking town after 2008 is

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,799
probably back in time for the summer

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,269
it's been talking the James Watts

6
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:16,710
apartment together

7
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:18,090
and since we're currently on a little

8
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,500
hiatus from brother and sister I

9
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,760
definitely want to smell something at

10
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,689
the end because I know you guys have all

11
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,070
miss him a lot

12
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:24,180
yesterday I anybody in front of and I

13
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,710
walked into my closet and I didn't know

14
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,330
what I wanted to wear and he was helping

15
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,279
me go through things and he was

16
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,869
critiquing a lot of my wardrobe and he

17
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,700
had definitely has a huge interest in

18
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:34,170
fashion but a little bit different than

19
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,790
your interest a little bit different

20
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:40,070
yeah but he definitely does like fashion

21
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:43,410
a lot Ian's outfits and my opinion are

22
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:44,700
scary it's the same thing yes you never

23
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,010
text season certain pictures before

24
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,050
posting but every time he does I always

25
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,030
look at them and I'm like wow that is

26
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,440
literally the worst since you clearly

27
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,149
have very different fashion senses I

28
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,390
thought it would be such a fun video to

29
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:59,280
do it in and I tried to buy each other

30
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,719
I'll bet like James did say we

31
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,039
definitely do have different styles of

32
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,660
clothing they like to wear but growing

33
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:05,939
up together I feel like we both have a

34
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,740
good sense of what we like so I thought

35
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:08,850
this challenge might be easy okay I

36
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,680
think every time I see you were in a

37
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,909
very very new style you change that your

38
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,040
interest and clothes a lot

39
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:15,810
whereas I'm feeling - I'm pretty similar

40
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,250
for the past few years so I think of

41
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,130
anything you might have this easier than

42
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:25,170
me say you like to wear like $1,000

43
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:26,820
black sweatshirts because they say so

44
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:28,110
basically to do this job today we're all

45
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,610
gonna head over to the mall and I'm

46
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,259
gonna shop with my best friend drew and

47
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:33,150
he's gonna take my videographer Kelly

48
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:34,740
and we're going to sister shop for each

49
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:37,079
other in secret and we're going to avoid

50
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,670
all cost not show each other what we're

51
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:41,610

52
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,990

look oh good question

56
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,299
okay I feel like we actually maybe

57
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:56,640

58
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:58,890

also wears a lot of chocolates like that

97
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:37,380

00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,690

adsense you can afford these pretty

easily so these might be enough all

106
00:04:02,359 --> 00:04:05,750
right so in order to really find

107
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:07,489

in James's style let me put the

110
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:13,069
Valentino's on hold but I'm kind of

111
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:18,919
scared to spend 700 but we're gonna keep

112
00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:20,389
on looking really like dragon boom pans

113
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:21,620
and that's the only straight boys that I

114
00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:23,120
really know with my life so that could

115
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:26,990
be a good option for you this is

116
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:29,930
definitely James book $350 there's no

117
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:31,880
matching pants might not be a good idea

118
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:36,460
once again was wearing tonight

119
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:36,460

00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:44,550
we need these this jacket says James

121
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:45,480
it's only five ninety so those Adsense

122
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,550
BAM

123
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:50,880
easy it's black so it's gonna match it

124
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:53,370
anything nonprofit shirt for one look I

125
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,810
need to just get him like a Q relatively

126
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:56,810
simple plain shirt that doesn't have

127
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:02,970
alright so we decided to get the

128
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:05,400
Burberry jacket was 6:46 instant change

129
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:07,320
after tax hopefully it's gonna like it

130
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,060
it's gonna match everything so let's

131
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,730
keep on jeans are you excited about your

132
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:13,710
sister purchases I really a look a big

133
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:15,360
brown bag okay guys we successfully

134
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:16,590
bought a pair of shoes in a jogger pan

135
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,120
and a jogger for me

136
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:20,040
our total came to at three hundred and

137
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,990
twenty six dollars this is proving to be

138
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:25,340
very expensive very quickly and we only

139
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:25,340
have two items down south

140
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:29,260
thrust

141
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:30,730
irenna scribes the whole Valentino shoes

142
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:32,620
I think we're gonna go with these

143
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:35,530
because it changes the true indeed a

144
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:36,790
sister adidas sponsor there we go this

145
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:38,320
is the hot arrest on slightly low by

146
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:39,880
right yeah

147
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,050
waiting to knocking on that that is

148
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,460
awfully short of everything it was her

149
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,960
away I really like the shirt business

150
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:45,820
blind they are to get really cute

151
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:48,250
conventionally while Achaeans outfit but

152
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:50,020
he is notorious for wearing oversized

153
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:52,240
shirts and he's already very tall and

154
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:53,860
skinny so I don't want to make any more

155
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,540
of a string bean than he already is and

156
00:05:53,860 --> 00:06:05,440
this shirt is very long so I'm gonna

157
00:05:55,540 --> 00:06:07,510
hold this contender but his pants are

158
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,190
usually like just straight fit kits that

159
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:10,900
are cropped way to hide those ankles

160
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:12,370
look weird what my biggest have to do is

161
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,960
with the alpha jump a couple be honest

162
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:16,180
so this one needs like charcoal jeans

163
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,020
that I think it actually really good and

164
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:27,100
they're definitely not something that he

165
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:28,810
has so we're actually done at getting

166
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,430
has entire outfit so that's really great

167
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:31,960
work really professional shopper is but

168
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:33,070
since manager are done so earlier we're

169
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,410
gonna go get some ice cream

170
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:38,160
a sister snack while again the finished

171
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:38,160
stop because he sucks

172
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:51,040
there were definitely a look at some

173
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:52,900
kappas folks I know James is a couple

174
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:58,330
items already so we're gonna find

175
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:59,710
something he doesn't already back to

176
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:02,530
Louisville the shoes and pants and

177
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:04,030
jackets oh my goodness yes those

178
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:05,260
shopping so I decided to peace out for a

179
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:08,080
few minutes and take a little bit of a

180
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:11,350
detour to get Ian a little sister

181
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,970
surprise so we just got double dose we

182
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:15,370
got some dior glasses and a cap a

183
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:16,600
t-shirt James Andrew said they were done

184
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:18,310
with their whole outfit but they said

185

00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:47,920
it's not like God not just this thing

239
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:55,190
okay I think they're pretty civil side

240
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:57,410
of the shirt you have on now they match

241
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:59,870
it okay I think they're pretty cute do

242
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:02,590
you like everything gray right and below

243
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:06,700

00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:11,030
yes okay do you like that yeah really

245
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:12,020
yeah I feel like when I was in your

246
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:13,490
pieces I really want to make sure a lot

247
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,510
of the things like went together because

248
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:16,250
they like one of the main issues you

249
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:19,010
have with your office is that they never

250
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:20,000
match there's always like a few really

251
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:22,960
good elements with and there's always

252
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,800
like that one thing that you add that's

253
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:30,010
ever like not me you just have no you

254
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,720
just have questionable taste okay ready

255
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:32,980
I have no idea what pants you got for

256
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:37,149
those shoes now Matt you're really

257
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:40,420
scared why only a very few amount of

258
00:11:37,149 --> 00:11:42,339
pair of pants that that's not true we

259
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:43,360
actually don't really think about oh I

260
00:11:42,339 --> 00:11:44,350
don't really think all these pants

261
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,180
watching my shoes

262
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:55,450
well the rest go together really nicely

263
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:57,250
we'll be fine okay okay good I got you a

264
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:58,510
good pair of dark skinny because they're

265
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,950
not fully blocked because they like you

266
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:01,360
have a lot of black pants already and

267
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:02,260
they're like a nice wash and I also

268
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,640
think you don't really have that when

269
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:05,470
you purchase skinny jeans my most a lot

270
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,300
of pants that you wear are kind of

271
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:10,149
straight fit and you cut them at the

272
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:11,920
ankle and it doesn't look good okay Wow

273
00:12:10,149 --> 00:12:16,810
two for two so far Nevers are gonna move

274
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:17,830
in with the shoes though yeah yeah I

275
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:19,450
will admit I don't really think about

276
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:21,970
that together but I think we should be

277
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:24,790
fine next item is your certain rue de

278
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:26,260
Mexican dude this shirt I've ever really

279
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:27,640
cute I feel like you have a lot of like

280
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:29,500
graphic tees so introducing that was

281
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,610
like simple but I had like some sort of

282
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:34,180
element to it so it like you would

283
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:35,050
actually watch we're cool I think it

284
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,310
it's a little bit long the way I have to

285
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:38,440
crop it depending on looks with the

286
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:40,750
outfit I don't like not crop but like

287
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,529
just like cut like two inches off like a

288
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:44,650
crop top

289
00:12:41,529 --> 00:12:47,260
although that is a good approach to you

290
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:49,089
pick a lot of items that make you look

291
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:51,339
like a string bean like you're already

292
00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:53,230
very tall and lanky and you wear shirts

293
00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:55,690
that are like eight inches too long and

294
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:57,550
pans that are straight and no jacket and

295
00:12:55,690 --> 00:13:00,610
like long shoes so you just look like

296
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:05,230
you're like 87 feet tall about your

297
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:08,670
knots we need to break it to you ready I

298
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:11,640
guess lastly we have this last one

299
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:12,720
now uses last okay we found this one

300
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,230
first and I actually think you're really

301
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,230
gonna like this one

302
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:24,030
oh god I almost want another one for

303
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:25,800
myself I think you'll look so good or

304
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:27,870
not it's a large so it still gives you

305
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,400
like that oversized shape with a bigger

306
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:31,410
t-shirt and then we got either really

307
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:33,030
skinny jeans are kind of like taper of

308
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:36,620
the body give you a little sister shape

309
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:43,520
instead of being a sister shrimpy yeah

310
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:45,870
I'm excited if you go put them on what

311
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:47,010

314
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:57,750
extra sister in here it's kind of as a

315
00:13:53,670 --> 00:14:00,900
good lock okay they really are a little

316
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:02,370
big role that's how you do that's what

317
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:10,080
you do when your pants are too big dude

318
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:17,850

everything you guys sister shucks the

326
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,390

327
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,830
I actually really love on this look

328
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:39,690
looks on you I think even though that

329
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:40,860
seems a little bit uncomfortable they do

330
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:42,660
look really good it definitely did

331
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:44,160
exactly what I wanted it to do of giving

332
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:45,660
you kind of like the larger oversized

333
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,920
pores on the top but the skinnier

334
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:49,100
portions on the bottom so everything

335
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:51,930
looks a lot more cohesive and not as

336
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:54,860
strangely like I do have one last thing

337
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:54,860
to add to this outfit

338
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:04,250

348
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:39,569
thousand dollars on this challenge today

349
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:42,079
that no budget thing really made it no

350
00:15:39,569 --> 00:15:42,079
challenge

351
00:15:43,710 --> 00:16:04,580
[Music]

352
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:06,290
all right it's like as that completes

353
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:07,850
his sister shopping spree in this video

354
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:09,560
today I actually had so much fun doing

355
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:11,180
this not gonna lie I was a little bit

356
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:13,100
worried in the beginning because like I

357
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:14,390
said again cell is ever-changing but I

358
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,340
was very much looking forward to putting

359
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,900
you in something much cuter than the

360
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:19,310
average sister you've helped and I am

361
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,360
very proud of how this turned out and

362
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:22,190
I'm glad you like it

363
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:26,510
I think James's style is very hard to

364
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:28,610
find in store is actually really true
