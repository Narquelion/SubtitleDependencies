00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,959
hi sisters James Charles here and

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:05,670
welcome back to my youtube channel for

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:07,140
today's video I am very excited because

4
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:09,510
we are doing something that we have not

5
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,940
done in quite a long time but I love to

6
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:13,559
do and that is a makeup challenge

7
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,540
now this particular challenge has been

8
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:17,340
requested non-stop in my comments with

9
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,600
lost several videos in a row and I've

10
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,670
actually wanted to do this for so long

11
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,869
so I'm very very excited and this is

12
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,570
what I think I'm going to call it the

13
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:26,070
LED lights challenge now you're probably

14
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,810
wondering James what the heck are you

15
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,760
talking about and don't worry I'm gonna

16
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,679
explain it to you right now it is a huge

17
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,239
trend for people to buy LED at little

18
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,710
light trips and put them at the top of

19
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:36,989
their rooms for cool fun lighting

20
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,850
effects and also tik-tok transitions

21
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:40,620
now speaking of tick-tock this actually

22
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,480
became a trend octave talked a few weeks

23
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,829
ago where basically people were changing

24
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,600
the color of their lights and doing

25
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:47,070
their makeup in a specific color now

26
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,510
this may not seem too difficult because

27
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,280
we all have our everyday makeup products

28
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,800
that we know and love abut where it gets

29
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,360
very difficult is the eyeshadow portion

30
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,559
I want to show you guys a quick example

31
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,690
because a lot of people were actually

32
00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:00,180
using my palette for this challenge

33
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:02,250
because there are 39 beautiful rainbow

34
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:05,129
colors but when you turn on your LED

35
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:07,290
lights like this it's not so very blue

36
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:09,810
anymore and now they all look the exact

37
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:11,070
same so for this challenge today I'm not

38
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,600
beneath my palette because I have it

39
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,070
memorized I'm gonna pick up a random

40
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,170
colorful palette from my makeup

41
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:17,670
collection and I'm gonna try my best to

42
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,890
do my full face of makeup and a

43
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:22,320
beautiful eye shadow look using only a

44
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,580
colorful LED lighting and at the end of

45
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,430
this video you and I will find out

46
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,750
together how actually turns out let's

47
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:31,920
get started

48
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,920
[Music]

49
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:37,180
okay you guys I just want to talk about

50
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,950
right not only because I'm excited but

51
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,960
also because this is really hurting my

52
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:42,400
eyes and like messing up my overall

53
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,600
vision like I said in the beginning the

54
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,070
face person is probably gonna be pretty

55
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,720
easy so I'm just gonna speed through

56
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:48,790
that but let's go ahead and get started

57
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,670
I am first going to color correct using

58
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:54,190
my bright green dragon beauty color

59
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:57,430
corrector I'm gonna put it on my beard

60
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:59,320
area this looks so crazy and this

61
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:00,550
lighting holy crop and quite let's go

62
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,960
ahead and blend this end just bringing

63
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:04,030
the excess underneath the eyes or some

64
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,710
nice dark circle coverage now for a

65
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:07,660
foundation I'm gonna mix together my

66
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:10,540
noble two which is the Dior air flash

67
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:12,160
and fenty Pro filter in the shade at 150

68
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:14,200
foundation matching is already hard for

69
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,180
me in a normal lighting so this lighting

70
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,530
should be a very interesting I know

71
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,820
these two colors mix very well to make

72
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:20,560
my skin tone but I'm not really sure

73
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:22,150
what this looks like I'm just gonna

74
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,100
blend it in using my Beauty sponge as

75
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,480
always I mean I have no idea if my

76
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,560
foundations like well this is actually

77
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,570
harder than I even thought

78
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,550
well concealer I'm just gonna grab my

79
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:32,590
shape tape it in the shade light just

80
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:34,420
gonna put this in my normal high points

81
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:37,630
of my face so nigh use the wrong shade

82
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:39,340
no no this is tripping me out okay I'm

83
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:41,830
gonna blend it in I'm just going to set

84
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:43,989
this with powder like always using the

85
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:45,730
other side of my sponge pressing it in

86
00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:47,019
there to lock it it kind of contours

87
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:48,850
always easing my anasazi up Beverly

88
00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:50,200
Hills contour kits I do know where the

89
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:52,209
actual colors are on this palette and I

90
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,890
know that I always use this middle one

91
00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:55,600
but I don't think I can't really tell

92
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:59,739
how intense this is gonna look I just

93
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:01,330
think my normal skin oh no I'm Simon

94
00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:02,890
well I'm actually getting nervous about

95
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:06,489
this okay and I'm just going to contour

96
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:07,480
my nose as well this might get bad fast

97
00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:09,280
I'm gonna come out of here and have like

98
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,930
the harshest nose contour of our weight

99
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,610
it literally looks like there's nothing

100
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:14,320
there but I'm also scared of it packing

101
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:17,200
it on there and then turning the light

102
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:19,420
back on and looking insane so I'm like

103
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:23,160
trying to tread lightly here and be

104
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:23,160
careful don't do contour my forehead

105
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:30,940
yeah I did not bronze thought that I did

106
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,900
not do okay so lately bronzing a little

107
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:34,980
bit of blush using the Kylie cosmetics

108
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:36,600
pink dreams which looks bright yellow

109
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:40,390
[Music]

110
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:42,220
look oh my god this is so insane what

111
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:43,360
the hatch we try to change the color and

112
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,830
see if it looks different like a

113
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,450
different color I'm sure it will right

114
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:49,060
let's let's try it

115
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:51,310
whoa oh here I can dip my nose contour

116
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:52,780
is definitely there I can see that oh oh

117
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:59,050
I can see the colors a little bit easier

118
00:03:52,780 --> 00:04:00,489
in the blue everything good sneeze we

119
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:04,959
come stand in here and see if it looks

120
00:04:00,489 --> 00:04:07,630
slow hmm oh I took a block light

121
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,130
oh whoa it's like a block like that when

122
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:12,040
you're like investigating a crime scene

123
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:13,269
you're looking for hidden specimens okay

124
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,030
well now looking in this light I can

125
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:19,959
tell my contour is a little harsh

126
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:21,280
oh holy crap

127
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,960
for brows Otis could use my Anasazi

128
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,639
eyebrow powder and the shade and medium

129
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,080
brown and I'm just gonna clean my brows

130
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,720
up using a little bit of concealer and a

131
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,400
flat top brush I think this is good it

132
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,080
was definitely harder than I thought but

133
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,419
I think if we flicked the lights back on

134
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,950
right now it would look okay that being

135
00:04:34,419 --> 00:04:37,450
said we're about to move into the eye

136
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:39,520
shadow portion and this is where it gets

137
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:41,050
a very very difficult I would love to

138
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,729
say in this blue lighting because it

139
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:44,650
hurts my head a lot less and I can

140
00:04:42,729 --> 00:04:45,669
actually see a little bit of colors but

141
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,410
this is a makeup challenge

142
00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:49,389
I don't want the speed too easy so let's

143
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:52,600
go ahead and flip the LED lights you

144
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:55,660
look at my skin yeah ah oh that is a

145
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:58,229
harsh contour oh my god did I really

146
00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:00,130
contour things that harsh Princess Fiona

147
00:04:58,229 --> 00:05:02,169
for this videos today I'm going to use

148
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:03,970
the Stacey at Marie xB perfect cosmetics

149
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:05,320
carnival palette because in normal

150
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,120
lighting this is a very very beautiful

151
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:09,190
and pigmented or rainbow palette similar

152
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,320
to mine but I don't have any of the

153
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:13,030
color positions memorized at all so the

154
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,590
finished result will be colorful could

155
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:16,330
be good it could be bad on but we're not

156
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:17,560
gonna find out until then so let's jump

157
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:19,240
in since we are focus on the eyes for

158
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,280
this challenge I do think it would be

159
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,440
fun it also might really come back to

160
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,610
bite me in the butt to do one eye in the

161
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,889
green lighting and a certain color

162
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:28,450
combination and then switch the lighting

163
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:30,010
and do a different color combination in

164
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:31,570
a different color and then in the end

165
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:33,310
when we turned the normal light back on

166
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:34,750
and see which I actually like looks

167
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:37,900
better and it's like a better color

168
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:39,340
situation but I have plans to go out to

169
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,960
dinner with my friends after this and

170
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:43,690
being in public might not be a good idea

171
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,820
so I'm going to of course prime my lids

172
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:48,310
using a little bit of concealer and I'm

173
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:51,130
gonna do my left eye first I'm first

174
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:52,210
gonna grab a four five six brush which

175
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:54,010
is my custom brush that I created with

176
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:54,550
morphia let's go James for 10% off and

177
00:05:54,010 --> 00:06:00,640
let's do

178
00:05:54,550 --> 00:06:03,070
to the shade no no idea okay let's do

179
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,580
her suasion I don't know what this color

180
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,260
is

181
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:07,510
but it looks like it's a lighter color

182
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:09,160
than a lot of the other ones so at least

183
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:10,540
that means we'll be able to like put it

184
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,250
in the right place so I'm gonna grab

185
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:14,290
persuasion and I'm gonna use this brush

186
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:17,560
that i'm gonna start patting it in my

187
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:20,680
outer corner in a nice little v-shape

188
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:24,010
and now I'm gonna grab a and 4-3-3 brush

189
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:27,330
and let's dip into the color show boat

190
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:29,320
I'm gonna use show boat to blend out

191
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:30,850
persuasion I'm gonna next gonna have

192
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,290
another M 4-3-3 brush and dip into the

193
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:34,480
shade called the height and I was gonna

194
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:36,100
put this in my inner corner and blending

195
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,810
those together in person the blend of

196
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,910
this looks really really beautiful and

197
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:41,770
on camera it looks no it looks okay

198
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:43,420
still but it could look better this is

199
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:44,650
actually really fun I'm sure I say that

200
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:46,270
now until I turn the lights back on and

201
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:48,550
I look like I got hit by a bus now gonna

202
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:50,320
grab a little bit more of persuasion on

203
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:53,110
my own four five six brush I'm going to

204
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:55,690
tuck this underneath my lash line like

205
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:58,150
this and no grabbing some of showboat on

206
00:06:55,690 --> 00:07:01,780
my other brush and buffing that color

207
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:03,370
out so now that that is there so there's

208
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:05,380
this color in this palette

209
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:07,990
it's called ecstasy and it's looking

210
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:10,060
like it is lime-green and I'm gonna grab

211
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:12,040
ecstasy on a pencil brush and I'm going

212
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:14,770
to press this in my inner corner for a

213
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:16,270
nice vivid hop the fact that it's not

214
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:18,040
even showing up on my skin it makes me

215
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:19,810
think that it probably is actually a

216
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,130
neon green color and I'm just going to

217
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:23,530
cut my crease using a little bit of a

218
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:25,030
concealer and a flat top brush I'm gonna

219
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:26,650
get the shade of peppermint and I'm

220
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:28,150
gonna give it a nice spread of some

221
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:30,940
prepping setting spray and then I'm

222
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:32,830
going to pack this on the lid carefully

223
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:35,170
packing this color on there making sure

224
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:36,610
not to mess up my cut crease and I'm

225
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:39,550
also gonna take the color

226
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:42,280
backchecked so I'm going to put this

227
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:44,590
particular color on the lid as well in

228
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:47,320
this like outer area and that was my

229
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:49,360
same M 4 or 5 6 brush before diving a

230
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:51,400
little bit more of persuasion I'm just

231
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,620
going to top this over the edge and make

232
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,290
sure it is nice

233
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:57,720
blended out alright so I think that is

234
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:58,890
pretty much one I all complete I have no

235
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,030
idea what that's gonna look like I'm

236
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:02,280
gonna add of course lashes and mascara

237
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:03,870
after but for now let's go ahead and

238
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,160
switch the lighting one more time and

239
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:13,260
move on to the other eye and see what we

240
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:15,780
can come up with oh no oh God what the

241
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:17,760
heck what is what I do I look like I

242
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:20,040
have a black eye this is it looks so

243
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,570
normal and the right thing oh my god

244
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,800
this is so bad

245
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:24,030
well we have nothing to lose now so

246
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,410
we're just gonna go ahead a Primus other

247
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:26,580
eyelid so I definitely need some of the

248
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:28,560
colors in the palette that we didn't use

249
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,640
it the last time so this time I'm gonna

250
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,080
grab the shade

251
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,490
let's try covering the shade of wasted

252
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,560
in this lighting the shade looks like a

253
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:37,020
light purple so grabbing the shade of

254
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,120
wasted I won't say another M 4 5 6 brush

255
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:40,740
and putting this in the outer area and

256
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,150
topping this M okay I'm just putting us

257
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,250
in the same type of motion and lightly

258
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:46,620
blending out the edges as we go next I'm

259
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:47,850
gonna grab the shade in lust I don't

260
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:50,100
know this is gonna be what we're gonna

261
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:52,410
try to blend out wasted using this color

262
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:54,750
don't be shy put some more ok blending

263
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:58,970
this out now with another M 4 5 6 brush

264
00:08:54,750 --> 00:09:02,880
let's grab the color lips because our

265
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:04,440
mmhmm yeah let's go the color left

266
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,030
because it is right next to endless

267
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,890
sometime I think this is gonna be nice

268
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:09,480
and warm tone as opposed to whatever we

269
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:10,920
have going on over here

270
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,720
blend it down to the lower lash line as

271
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,880
well for the public art on this eye I'm

272
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,650
gonna grab the shade called pepti in the

273
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,270
bottom of the palette so we're gonna cut

274
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:20,190
our crease once again okay once you're

275
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:21,960
gonna grab me another flat brush I'm

276
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:24,690
gonna dip into let's do the shade of

277
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:26,070
pink me I know for a fact this one's

278
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,450
gonna be pink because of the name so

279
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:29,040
thank you Stacy for that one and we're

280
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:30,840
gonna put this one all over the lid up

281
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,970
just like we did with our last color

282
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,350
keeping it nice and light for the outer

283
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:36,330
portion I'm gonna get a little bit of

284
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:38,730
the shade at temptation I'm gonna put

285
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:41,940
this to blend together that pink talked

286
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:43,740
and wasted color alright you guys so

287
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:45,870
that is the shadow portion of both eyes

288
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:47,490
all complete I'm horrified because this

289
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:49,140
eye it looked a lot like this I did

290
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:50,070
before we switch the lighting so I don't

291
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,080
know what's gonna happen when we change

292
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:53,640
the color next but before we do that I'm

293
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,990
gonna go ahead and apply it lashes and

294
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,029
mascara and then we

295
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:58,560
we'll finish off this long alright you

296
00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:00,209
guys we are back I popped on lashes and

297
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,010
mascara thank god the only color

298
00:10:00,209 --> 00:10:03,750
involved with those are black so no

299
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:05,250
surprises there so let's go ahead and do

300
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,720
a highlighter I'm just gonna grab my

301
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,770
highlighting brush and the B probe it

302
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,120
tells that I thought about actually has

303
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:10,589
highlighters in it so I'm just gonna go

304
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,990
this top one because it looks like it's

305
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:15,060
the lightest and let's go ahead and just

306
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:17,190
pop this on look at all the top of the

307
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:19,110
brows it's always a little bit on the

308
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:20,850
chin and then my nose highlight as well

309
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:22,529
okay so our last and final step is going

310
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:23,880
to be at the lips and I could just go

311
00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:25,200
ahead and grab a nude lip that I have on

312
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,510
my desk because I use them all the time

313
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,399
but this is already a mess okay let's be

314
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:31,140
real said to get more fun to reach into

315
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:33,390
my lipstick drawer and just pick out a

316
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:36,300
random color and see what ends up

317
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:37,440
happening once again alright so I went

318
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,060
ahead and I picked at this one from

319
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,680
Kylie cosmetics I have not looked at the

320
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:42,270
actual name but I picked this color

321
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,100
because it looked a little bit different

322
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:46,080
tone wise than a lot of the other

323
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,370
lipsticks that I knew were nudes in the

324
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,779
drawer so hopefully this will be

325
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:50,520
something fun that was saying that still

326
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:51,180
matches with the rest of the look

327
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,130
alright

328
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:54,630
I think that is this look all complete

329
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:56,610
I'm gonna go ahead give myself a quick

330
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:58,770
spritz of my morphia helping set setting

331
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:00,630
spray to really lock it in place and now

332
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:02,940
it is time ladies and gentleman after a

333
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:05,130
very long and scary makeup application

334
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:06,600
process to turn off our LED lights and

335
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:08,550
switch back to our normal Beauty

336
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:11,930
lighting and see what the heck we have

337
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:14,459
on our face are you guys ready one two

338
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:15,750
three I'm gonna look down first so my

339
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:25,770
eyes can adjust back to normal colors

340
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:28,860
okay okay oh wait a second this is cute

341
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:33,270
like not good not good but oh my god

342
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:37,770
wait a second what you know I just far

343
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:39,750
as I'm wearing green lipstick I have a

344
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:41,100
nun green lipstick like that's cute

345
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,450
I like none of this the skin doesn't

346
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,010
look that bad and this lip color was

347
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:45,480
definitely the worst decision out of all

348
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:47,339
of them otherwise you guys well I think

349
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,680
that is this LED lights makeup challenge

350
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:51,270
all complete I had a so much fun filming

351
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,800
this today despite the fact that it was

352
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:54,720
quite the emotional roller coaster all

353
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,399
the way it through I went into this with

354
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,020
very very low expectations because I'm

355
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,250
so used to my beautiful white lighting

356
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,480
and I had a feeling that the colored

357
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:03,360
lighting was going to be very very

358
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,010
deceiving and oh boy was it in the end

359
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,140
do feel like both looks that we came up

360
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:08,459
with are kind of cute I had fun and

361
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,690
that's all that matters and I really

362
