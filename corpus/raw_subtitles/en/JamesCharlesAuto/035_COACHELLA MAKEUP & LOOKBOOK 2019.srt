below and let's jump into the video all

62
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,280
right you guys so the first step of my

63
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,930
makeup routines today is of course going

64
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,400
to be at moisturizing it you guys know

65
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:09,000
my writer diet is the tatcha dewy skin

66
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:10,979
cream the air here is literally so dry

67
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
like I am scared then again we are in

68
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,770
the desert so I should have expected

69
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,940
this but like it's borderline gross I

70
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,590
feel like my lungs are being filled with

71
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,730
dirt which is not fun feeling just in

72
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:19,320
case you've never experienced that

73
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,730
before I wouldn't recommend 0 out of 10

74
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,980
there's gonna grab a nice little

75
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:25,260
generous glob on my fingers and really

76
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,280
brought this in for a real one jumping

77
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,600
right into foundation I'm gonna grab my

78
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,970
Too Faced Born This Way in the shade

79
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,250
golden for today at quite darker than at

80
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:34,500
the normal Charles skin tone I did get a

81
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:37,080
spray tan of course to be nice and

82
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,280
golden for Coachella it's literally so

83
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,780
hot here though that I've been sweating

84
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,220
it off in my sleep that is so disgusting

85
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,680
you probably do not want to hear that

86
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:48,219
but we're gonna try our best to

87
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:49,989
much I said try I didn't say try

88
00:02:48,219 --> 00:02:52,079
dispatches will a knock though perhaps I

89
00:02:49,989 --> 00:02:53,829
shouldn't mix in a little something else

90
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:56,170
do you smell that

91
00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:57,400
I saw scandal ok flake this is actually

92
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,049
a pretty decent color for my skin

93
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,659
honestly and the sunlight like it's

94
00:02:59,049 --> 00:03:02,170
really hard to even tell us a lot really

95
00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:04,030
good

96
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:05,560
but luckily most have like my neck and

97
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:08,170
my top it's gotta be covered in the look

98
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,090
that I'm wearing today my bottom not so

99
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:11,319
much but we can definitely get away with

100
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,180
a little bit of a color match I mean

101
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:14,980
we've done it and everybody on the path

102
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:16,120
so who's stopping us now I think we

103
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,319
should just like chitchat and catch up

104
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,049
while I'm getting ready today because I

105
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:21,489
don't do these like very often and it is

106
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:23,290
always so fun to just catch up with you

107
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:24,790
guys and talk to you and now UN on

108
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,959
what's going on in my life right now

109
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:28,150
pretty happy

110
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:29,260
not gonna lie I've been able to say that

111
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,879
in kind of a long time now which

112
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:32,620

love to be honest even though I am here

140
00:04:18,159 --> 00:04:21,489
for work it is like a mini vacation at

141
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:23,259
the same time and it just feels so good

142
00:04:21,489 --> 00:04:24,970
to take a little bit of time off and to

143
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:26,620
just focus on the people that mean the

144
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:35,380
most to me and just have a really really

145
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:36,940

speaking of that being so good you guys

147
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,509
oh my god yesterday I announced that I

148
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:42,520
deficiency be performing on the

149
00:04:40,509 --> 00:04:45,340
Coachella mainstage on Sunday at the

150
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:47,470
closing day right before Ariana my brand

151
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:49,210
new hit single a wolf won't won't um

152
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:51,729
literally bigger stage I've ever been on

153
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:53,050
it's so exciting no but can you actually

154
00:04:51,729 --> 00:04:54,090
imagine a house before that go tell like

155
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:56,250
how Lent and

156
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:57,960
that would be holy crap this one band

157
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,310
called razor bumps actually it's

158
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,870
performing at Coachella and I tweeted a

159
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:02,790
few days ago because obviously if you

160
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,350
guys were here last year you would know

161
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:11,250
that I didn't exactly have the best luck

162
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:12,810
when it came to shaving my you know down

163
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,639
there and it turned into quite the

164
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:16,740
controversial topic on of social media

165
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,970
which first of all is so crazy literally

166
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,040
every single person in the entire world

167
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:21,360
has gotten razor bumps at some point in

168
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,010
their life let's be honest if you're

169
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,660
telling you that you have not then

170
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:27,000
you're a liar it's a very very normal

171
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,050
thing but this year just let you know

172
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,790
I've been getting laser hair removal

173
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:31,500
every six weeks and down there it's

174
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:33,570
currently completely hairless we're

175
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,850
ready to go ready to be out and revealed

176
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:38,190
and there will not be a scandal this

177
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:39,450
year but oh my god when I tweeted that I

178
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:41,190
was actually performing like that as a

179
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:44,160
joke so many people thought I was being

180
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:46,320
it serious that my name James Charles

181
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,229
was literally trending number three

182
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,370
worldwide on the Apple music charts

183
00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:51,600
because people were looking for my

184
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:53,639
single that I was gonna be performing

185
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,350
like this actually happened which I

186
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:56,700
thought was literally one of the

187
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:58,919
funniest things in the entire world you

188
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:00,840
guys always that shocked me and how

189
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:01,860
powerful you are like I always forget

190
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,510
that making jokes like that could

191
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:06,210
actually lead to something very very

192
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:07,530
serious I love being an influencer when

193
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:09,300
using my platform for the right things

194
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:10,020
but those are the mr. crazy so I love

195
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,090
you so much

196
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:14,370
all jokes aside unfortunately I will not

197
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:16,169
be performing at Coachella this year but

198
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:17,820
you never know what next year has to

199
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:20,010
hold it's not a Coachella performance I

200
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:21,720
guarantee you that just contains a quick

201
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:23,490
spritz of the morphine prep and set

202
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,479
settings right and then I was gonna be a

203
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:26,370
little bit of the laura mercier

204
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,470
translucent setting powder and sat in on

205
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:29,789
my face I could literally just sit here

206
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:31,919
and stare at the camera for five minutes

207
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:34,380
and my foundation would completely dry

208
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,300
down that's literally how dry the air is

209
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:37,710
here but I do want to make sure I set

210
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,720
like under my eyes and then or my

211
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:41,340
forehead just to avoid a creasing it

212
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,660
because I will definitely be sweating it

213
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,770
later on and then once that is all set

214
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,750
in place I'm just going to use my usual

215
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,260
Anasazi Beverly Hills contour kit and my

216
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,750
morphe

217
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:50,340
for all five just to chisel off my face

218
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:52,229
but sense my foundation is a little bit

219
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:54,090
darker I'm just gonna go a little bit

220
00:06:52,229 --> 00:06:55,169
heavier this time that could be

221
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:56,789
literally the worst mistake of my life

222
00:06:55,169 --> 00:06:58,320
oh my god we just like what this here's

223
00:06:56,789 --> 00:07:00,990
actual like music lineup for the

224
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,760
festival - I'm so pumped for the last

225
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,700
few years I'm not gonna lie I definitely

226
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,620
was more in it

227
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,760
Instagram photos just because even

228
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,960
though I love music and it's such a big

229
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,300
part of my life there are not that many

230
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,530
artists that I like specifically listen

231
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,150
to I definitely the type person that

232
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:14,800
just turns on the radio and just sings

233
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:15,490
along with whatever is currently on and

234
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,860
enjoys it

235
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:18,880
but this year I think there's so many

236
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:21,550
artists that I was actually looking

237
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:24,160
forward to getting to watch last night I

238
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:26,500
watched Burbank for the first time and

239
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,910
it was literally like a life-changing

240
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,440
experience I announced on Twitter a few

241
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:31,750
days ago that I'm officially a Stan okay

242
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,340
I'm a fellow blink and I got to see them

243
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,960
live last night in the artist section 2

244
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:37,030
which was so crazy because they were

245
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,010
literally right there I am beyond

246
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:40,990
obsessed with black pink Jenny at least

247
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:43,240
outros a jisu I love you guys literally

248
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:44,710
the obstacles in the entire world just

249
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,240
truly one of the most incredible

250
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:48,610
experiences and performances I've ever

251
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,620
seen the dancing the choreography not a

252
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:52,930
single beat mess not a single word miss

253
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:55,450
not a single note mess like absolute

254
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,770
perfection I am beyond obsessed Kacey

255
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:58,120
Musgraves perform yesterday I heard to

256
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:59,980
see a little bit of her set bazi

257
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,500

258
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,940
him Billie is on stage tonight and I am

259
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,410
so pumped oh my god this is gonna be my

260
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:07,510
first time ever seeing her live

261
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:09,010
I am a true Billie I list and right now

262
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:10,660
I am like obsessed with her brand new

263
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:13,270
album I think it is so beyond incredible

264
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:14,320
I just discovered her music a few months

265
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:16,240
ago but I've been listening to it

266
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,910
literally non-stop and I think her vibe

267
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,800
is just so what different and so cool to

268
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:23,080
watch she really inspires me I would

269
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,010
love to video with her one day I think

270
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,360
there'll be the craziest thing ever I

271
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:27,760
know she literally never wears makeup

272
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,860
but like just imagine a one-time full

273
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:31,960
glam moment would be so fun and fresh I

274
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:34,360
think tame impala is later on tonight as

275
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:36,430
well tomorrow is ariana grande oh my god

276
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:38,530
I cannot wait to see all of her newest

277
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:40,479
songs performed live I was gonna try to

278
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:42,610
go to her la tour saw but unfortunately

279
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,110
I'll be traveling when she's here so I

280
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:46,300
get to see her at Coachella which is so

281
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:47,620
fun and so fresh Ariana's definitely my

282
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,000
favorite performers as well I went to

283
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:51,910
her concert a few years ago and it was

284
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,110
just absolutely mind-boggling so it's

285
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:54,340
just a really really cool year so I'm

286
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:55,870
really excited to actually go and be

287
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:57,970
able to listen to the music and watch

288
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:59,710
the performances rather than just be and

289
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,880
Instagram body which is like what

290
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:02,860
everybody makes fun of Coachella for

291
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,600
definitely can admit that that's been me

292
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:07,600
in the past but not this year

293
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:10,370

00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:44,540
them uneven but regardless we are here

310
00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:45,980

365
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:35,700
lipstick to cut my crease before that

366
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:37,440
I'm gonna got the m45 sticks that I had

367
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:40,020
at Cola on and dip into a little bit of

368
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,810
a playground and use this to blend

369
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:44,010
together the white and the dark blue and

370
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:46,350
then just using a little bit of a

371
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:48,870
flashback on a flat paka brush to set

372
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:49,950
the rest okay guys I think that is

373
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:51,720
pretty much the eyeshadow portion of

374
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:53,310
this look all complete literally so easy

375
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,140
only took a few colors from the palette

376
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:57,089
still very very colorful but not exactly

377
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:58,920
rainbow last year's look was definitely

378
00:11:57,089 --> 00:12:00,630
way darker and waist fougere where's

379
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,160
this here as much brighter more vibrant

380
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:04,170
and I absolutely love it

381
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,640
I'm gonna head in grab my lash curler

382
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:07,500
and get my lashes a nice curl and apply

383
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,730
my favorite mascara knock excited to

384
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,529
play and then get ready to pop on a pair

385
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:12,510
of lashes all right you guys and that is

386
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:15,360
one eye of my drag inspired colorful

387
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:16,470
festival makeup look all complete I'm

388
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,850
gonna go ahead and do the other one off

389
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:19,440
camera quickly and I'll be right back to

390
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:20,730
finish off the rest of the look all

391
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,500
right you guys we are back and both eyes

392
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:24,330
are all complete I am literally obsessed

393
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,500
with house look at turning out I'm now

394
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:27,120
going to quickly go ahead and spritz my

395
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:30,000
face using the morphe preppin set

396
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,370
setting so I just because it is so so so

397
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,660
dry and then of course using a face to

398
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:35,820
highlight could end up into a little bit

399
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:37,740
of literally on my eforp blush brush and

400
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:39,570
use this to blend together our face and

401
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:42,930
my contour because I really want this

402
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:44,400
look to be nice and blushed just popping

403
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:46,529
a little bit of glitter over top of my

404
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:48,150
highlight just for an extra fun little

405
00:12:46,529 --> 00:12:50,370
pop I'm gonna pop on my favorite nude

406
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:52,410

407
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:54,029

which you can use go James for 30 for 30

410
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:02,370

411
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:04,050
makeup routine it just a little bit of

412
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:05,430
the mac fix+ and the shade of gold Lee

413
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:07,230
