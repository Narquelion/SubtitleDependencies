00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,919
hi sisters james charles here and

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,680
welcome back to my youtube channel

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,040
today i'm up bright and early because i

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,280
am filming a video that i

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,280
truly never imagined would be happening

6
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,280
uh today i'm gonna be adopting a child

7
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,639
i love kids i think they're the cutest i

8
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,920
think they're the funniest i know i have

9
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,800
a lot of young fans out there as well

10
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,279
and i love you guys

11
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,840
so so so much but i have only talked

12
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,600
about

13
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,439
at least right now in my life the fact

14
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,880
that i do not want kids i just don't

15
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,320
think that i'd be responsible enough to

16
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,599
actually have a child and i would never

17
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,519
want to bring a kid into this world and

18
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,439
not be able to take a good care of it

19
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,760
and i just referred to a child as it

20
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,040
this is why

21
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,559
every time that i talk about not wanting

22
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,079
to have kids though every single adult

23
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:39,920
around me always yells at me and it's

24
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,520
like okay you never know until you try

25
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,960
so i guess that is the point of today's

26
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:48,399
video i'm going to be adopting a child

27
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,920
