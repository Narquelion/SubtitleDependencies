biggest dream since i was a little kid

and it's been my number one goal since

18
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,039
actually starting in social media and it

19
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,239

00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,920
actually purchased this home back in

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,440

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,320

all right you guys come on in i'm so

44
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,560
excited to show you the entire house

45
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,200
obviously upon entering the front door

46
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,479
we are in the nice lovely entryway

47
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,320
and the first room that we have right

48
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,430
here on the left is the formal

49
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:49,790
living room

50
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:49,790
[Music]

51
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,920
if you guys remember the last house tour

52
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,920
that we were in the vibe and like the

53
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,759
layout is honestly pretty similar

54
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,680
but this house is like a trillion times

55
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,479
better and bigger so i'm so excited to

56
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,680
show you guys

57
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,600
my favorite part about this entire

58
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,119
formal living room is of course the fin

59
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,119
on the ground

60
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,560
but also this beautiful chandelier that

61
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,360
we have in the ceiling

62
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,879
and also this stunning floor-to-ceiling

63
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,160
fireplace my friends and i are in here

64
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,280
all the time singing together and having

65
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,879
little jam sessions

66
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,760
personally i cannot read music but as

67
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:23,840
long as you know how to play the

68
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,840
classics that's all that matters

69
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,360
coming out of the formal living room we

70
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,040
are of course back into it the entryway

71
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,560
we just have this cute little circle

72
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,840
mirror and i love this detail that

73
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,239
literally looks like it's like heading

74
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,319
from

75
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,360
a pen obviously it's secure on the wall

76
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,720
because there's a lot of earthquakes

77
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,160
here in california but

78
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,599
it's just perfect to check our face

79
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,480
before we go out of the house and run

80
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,959
any errands

81
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,840
and then right around this way we have

82
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,080
the formal

83
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,519
dining room now i say formal because

84
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,840
honestly the chances of us

85
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,879
using this room are virtually very very

86
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,800
slim if i'm

87
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,920
being real we never use the dining room

88
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,360
or the last house and

89
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,200
already just from moving in here about a

90
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,560
month ago the only purpose of this room

91
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,480
has been either meetings

92
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,000
or dumping packages that we get from the

93
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,040
mailbox we really eat in the kitchen

94
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,440
which you guys will see a lot in a

95
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,640
second

96
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,720
along this one we just have the storage

97
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,239
cabinet and then right above it is this

98
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,599
picture which if you guys have been

99
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,120
following me for a long time you may

100
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,879
have recognized this this is actually a

101
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,800
photo that i took myself on my senior

102
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,400
trip in school to south africa

103
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,760
there's actually a few different photos

104
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,200
from the trip around the house which you

105
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,560
guys will spot throughout the tour

106
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,680
my amazing interior design team which

107
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,800
we'll talk about in a second wanted to

108
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,280
make sure that there were personal

109
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,720
touches

110
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,400
from me all throughout the house which i

111
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,840
just think is so so cool and really

112
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,879
important during interior design okay

113
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,560
now coming out of the

114
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,159
formal dining room if we keep walking

115
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,799
further into the home

116
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,640
this next feature is the wine cellar now

117
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,920
wine cellars are pretty popular in newer

118
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,680
construction builds especially in the

119
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,120
area that i'm in in california

120
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,280
but for somebody like me who doesn't

121
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,720
drink wine it's pretty pointless and if

122
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,560
you guys remember the last house

123
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,159
the wine cellar literally stayed empty

124
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,440
for the entire year and a half that i

125
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,120
was living there so when we moved into

126
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,400
this house i was like okay we have to

127
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,159
put something in there so at least

128
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,519
looks presentable so we decided to fill

129
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,840
it with one of my favorite drinks

130
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,519
coca-cola all right you guys so directly

131
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,000
across from the wine or

132
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,760
i guess coke seller is first of all the

133
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,920
stairs to the basement which will be

134
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,519
later on in the video i'm so excited to

135
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,439
show you and then we also have

136
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,040
the formal office i'm obsessed with

137
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,959
these beautiful glass

138
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,480
french doors that open up into the

139
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,639
formal office

140
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,320
now personally for me i'm not a very

141
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,759
like formal office type person i

142
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,720
honestly would just take my laptop and

143
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,720
work anywhere

144
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,080
which you guys obviously know um but we

145
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,280
didn't want to have a cute little like

146
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,720
office space just for anybody who

147
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,280
doesn't need to use it for anybody on my

148
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,280
team

149
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,120
and we also have my gaming set up here

150
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,360
it has been like months since i've

151
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,600
played any games or streamed online i

152
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,560
low-key honestly missed games with james

153
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,560
so if that's something you guys want to

154
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,080
see come back let me know because it's

155
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,440
all set up and ready to go so all right

156
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,199
now coming out of the office

157
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,040
i am so excited to show you guys the

158
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,520
space that we probably use the absolute

159
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,520
most

160
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,040
in this house it is such a massive

161
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:57,840
upgrade from the last place

162
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:57,840
and that is of course the kitchen

163
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,639
honestly you guys when i walked into

164
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,479
this house and saw the kitchen it was

165
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,160
almost like a guarantee in my heart that

166
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,639
i needed to buy this house because the

167
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,240
kitchen

168
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,080
really is the heart of the home there

169
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,400
are two beautiful stunning marble

170
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,160
double islands we have these massive

171
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,000
pendant lights light gray cabinets with

172
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,440
a lot of white features as well and i am

173
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,639
just absolutely in love

174
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,360
with this space it is no secret that i

175
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,600
do not cook

176
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,039
okay i'm not hiding it i postmates

177
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,360
literally every single

178
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,120
meal but despite the fact that i do not

179
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,880
cook my friends and i are in the kitchen

180
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,639
all the time eating sitting at the

181
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,800
island filming mooc bones together

182
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,639
talking gossiping and most importantly

183
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,680
just being with each other if i take you

184
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,039
guys back this way

185
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,800
there's not much back here other than

186
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,520
just like i think this is called the

187
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,360
butler's

188
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,800
area of the house i'm not really sure to

189
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,479

196
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,479
lot of snacking and i really want to

197
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,080

198
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,560
beautiful and organized it is

199
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,680
thanks to reorganize a few weeks from

200
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,880
instagram stories i was talking about

201
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,479
how we're moving into the house

202
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,199
and i got a dm from somebody being like

203
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,479
you need to get your house

204
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,319
professionally organized

205
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,840
and i was like what does that even mean

206
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,000
and i started doing research and

207
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,120
found out that there is literally people

208
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,639
whose job it is

209
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,479
to organize your house and make it look

210
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,000
pretty and i was so excited i posted it

211
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,880
on my stories rhea and her team reached

212
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,560
right out and they came

213
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,319
literally the next day and made the

214
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,919
house look so beautiful

215
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,600
this looks so good all thanks to her you

216
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,240
guys should definitely check her out

217
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,600
because she has saved my life okay so

218
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,280
right across from the kitchen we have

219
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,639
one of my favorite places in the entire

220
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,840
house which is the

221
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,840
living room

222
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,039
this is pretty much like the relaxation

223
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,319
destination

224
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,520
that little rhyme like i mentioned the

225
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,440
kitchen you guys know my friends and

226
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,479
family are here over all the time

227
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,919
and in the living room it was really

228
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,840
important that we had a lot of different

229
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,479
seating spaces so we have these gorgeous

230
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,280
chairs from

231
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,720
craft house we have this massive sofa

232
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,120
we're actually waiting to put another

233
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,639
like

234
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,080
chunk or like star

235
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,599
piece of the sofa and so we have here

236
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,520
before sitting space and then we have

237
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,520
this gorgeous leather shades lounger

238
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,720
look at me being a furniture expert

239
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,919
right below the tv

240
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,840
you know we are in here literally all

241
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:16,479
the time as a family and friend watching

242
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,759
movies playing xbox sometimes chilling

243
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,720
and honestly watching a lot of music

244
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,639
videos as well

245
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,080
it's just like a full vibe in here while

246
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,360
we're in one of my favorite rooms that i

247
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,280
feel like has really really good

248
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,720
decor i feel like it is only appropriate

249
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,840
to give a shout out to the interior

250
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,240
design company that did

251
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,520
the entire house from day one which is

252
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,120
leclaire decor

253
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,639
now brenda baby's home has been a really

254
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,759
stressful project but also a really

255
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,199
rewarding project

256
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,400
and working with la claire de court was

257
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,560
definitely one of the most like

258
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,800
rewarding partnerships i have ever had

259
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,240
i have nothing but like the absolute

260
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,080
best thing to say about them

261
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,599
um their entire design team sasha mel

262
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,080
and then i worked directly with meredith

263
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,919
was

264
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,440
amazing from beginning to end they were

265
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,440
just on top of everything they were so

266
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,800
organized they actually cared so much i

267
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,000
truly felt like on the last day of the

268
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,440
project when they were placing the final

269
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,639
decor items and really fluffing the

270
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,319
pillows and they're getting ready to

271
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,000
leave i was like losing a piece of

272
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,199
my family like they just took such good

273
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,240
care of me and if any of you guys want

274
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,120
to check them out if you were moving

275
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,440
into a new house

276
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,120
i would one billion percent recommend

277
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,160
leclaire decor for any of your amazing

278
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,720
design services

279
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,000
they did such a good job clearly and

280
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,800
this house would not look as beautiful

281
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
as it does

282
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,599
without them all right you guys so

283
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,039
there's only one area left of the main

284
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,840
floor that i want to show you and that

285
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,720
is the guest

286
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,919
bedroom now this is opposite of the

287
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,440
formal living room so

288
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,879
the other way when you come in the front

289
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,639
door as we move past the mud room and

290
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,720
the cute little ensuite bathroom

291
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,919
we have the guest room of the house

292
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,440
there are actually a lot of bedrooms

293
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,360
when i first moved into this home but we

294
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,479
converted most of them into workspaces

295
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,800
but it was definitely important that we

296
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,039
kept at least one being a guest room

297
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,560
and that is this room i love the wood

298
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,480
tones and the blue tones it gives me

299
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,519
very like beachy type fives and since we

300
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,880
have friends and family over all the

301
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,600
time it is the perfect place for any of

302
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,440
our guests to

303
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,800
sleep also it coincidentally happens to

304
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,440
be the room that is furthest from my

305
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,880
bedroom

306
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,800
so this is perfect for when the parents

307
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,399
come to visit nice and far away while

308
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,320
we're on the subject of bedrooms it is

309
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,480
finally time for me to take you guys

310
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,839
up to the next level of the house i'm

311
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,600
gonna take you guys off this beautiful

312
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,200
rounded staircase which coincidentally

313
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,560
when i was first looking at this home

314
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,000
i hated so much this entire wall used to

315
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,880
be all ship flap and the railings were

316
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,800
different and it was

317
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,480
so ugly i actually talked to my

318
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,839
contractor about removing the routed

319
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,600
staircase all together

320
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,959
but once we made a few changes it really

321
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,800
came together and now i

322
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,640
am obsessed it is the most beautiful

323
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,920
stunning focal point of the home and

324
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,920
i just love that it brings your eye

325
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,720
upwards into this gorgeous round

326
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,720
landing area

327
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:35,279
[Music]

328
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,959
one of my favorite parts about the

329
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,800
entire house is this bookshelf wall

330
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,320
mainly because we have a rolling ladder

331
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,560
i don't know why this is just my biggest

332
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,560
dream

333
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:46,720
[Music]

334
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,399
it's not perfect we have a cute little

335
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,519
chair just sit down and relax and we

336
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,360
also have this gorgeous

337
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,959
huge mirror for lots of outfit photos i

338
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,200
always take my instagram selfies in here

the morning but i have my new looks on

341
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,399

342
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,200
room that i want to take you guys to

343
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,959

345
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,120

346
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,440
converted into

347
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,160
one place but we actually are in here

348
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,399

350
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,279

352
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,320

361
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,680
bunch of really cool pairs of shoes as

362
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,959
well to pair along with the outfits

363
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,120
and then we have this massive

364
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,000
floor-to-ceiling mirror which is either

365
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,000
our fitting room

366
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,279

lewis's bedroom now you guys obviously

371
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,240

372
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,160
almost every single one of my videos and

373
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,519
you've seen him on my instagram as well

374
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,360
i don't want to go too in depth because

375
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,079
obviously this is his space and not mine

376
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,760
um i

377
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,200
had to use adjectives to describe this

378
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,720
room it would be

379
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,320
um straight sure

380
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,760
well what else we want to say there's

381
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,000
artwork of a girl getting changed on the

382
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,440
wall

383
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,760
there's shoes everywhere it is art but

384
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,040
it's

385
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,880
very straight so that's lewis's room

386
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,320
sure right next to lucy's room is the

387
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,120
laundry room there's not much to say

388
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,240
about the laundry room

389
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,920
there's a double washer and dryer

390
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,200
because we have so many clothing items

391
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,000
in this house that need to get washed

392
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,519
all the time

393
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,040
maybe cute little blue pendant and just

394
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,640
some things that are air dry and then

395
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,640
right across the hall from lewis's room

396
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,160
is trevor's room once again this is

397
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,519
trevor space not mine so i don't want to

398
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,040
do the tour for him but

399
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,480
it's very very cute very simple he has

400
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,279
his desk there because trevor is still

401
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,880
in college

402
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,399
which is incredible he balances doing

403
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,079
full-on school work and working with me

404
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,880
full-time which is amazing we love him

405
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,160
and we stand

406
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,079
very kind of like similar vibes to the

407
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,720
guest room downstairs lots of cool

408
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,200

409
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,440
beachy

410
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,800

411
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,920

412
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,120

right into my space

420
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:03,390
[Music]

421
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,120
we have this beautiful four poster bed

422
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,600
keeping the same theme with the beachy

423
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,600
vibes

424
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,279

425
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,600

we have this gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous

427
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,920
gorgeous chandelier in the middle of the

428
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,560
room

429
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,160
personally i hate chandeliers i don't

430
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,680
know what it is i can never find ones

431
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,800
that i like but this one

432
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,480
and the one downstairs were really

433
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,839
speaking to me so i'm so glad that we

434
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,399
found this one up for the space i think

435
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,320
it is

436
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,600
perfect along the opposite wall we have

437
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,839
another fireplace which is

438
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,040
so beautiful i love this matte stone

439
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,240
i've actually never seen anything like

440
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,200
that before especially with the wood

441
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,279
accents i think it looks

442
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,720
so good we have this tv which i

443
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,560
literally never use

444
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,399
some shelves and then also fun little

445
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,880
added feature there's a mini fridge in

446
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,240
here

447
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,600
this is actually fully filled with water

448
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,120
but i just finished it and have not

449
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,480
restocked it yet so i promise that i'm

450
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,480
not drinking coke before bed

451
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,519
the addiction is bad but not that bad i

452
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,120
have a mini fridge

453
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,120
okay come on into the master bathroom

454
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:03,680
[Music]

455
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,839
okay you guys i am obsessed with this

456
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,320
massive bathroom because of how big it

457
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,680
is

458
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,760
as you can see there's pretty much two

459
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,519
of everything and i'll explain why

460
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,360
it's because this bathroom and closet

461
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,920
was actually formatted to be his and

462
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,920
hers

463
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,920
but since it's be living here it's just

464
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,600
his and his there's two different things

465
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,399
there's two different toilets as well

466
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,959
one sheared tub and then one massive

467
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,040
massive

468
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,560
marble shower as of right now it's only

469
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,560
been using this in the morning but who

470
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,720
knows what future activities could

471
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,160
you know ensue later on next to the

472
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,720
shower as well i have this heated

473
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,240
towel rack which is so nice to leave

474
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,680
online in the shower so when i get out

475
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,440
of the shower and it's freezing cold

476
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,279
i get to warm up in my nice little towel

477
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,800
i thought that was a fun feature

478
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,240
uh this is always the vanity that i use

479
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,760
for getting ready so i have like my hair

480
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,240
hair stuff over there

481
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,519
and then this vanity is like my personal

482
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,839
care item so i have

483
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,920

00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,399
stuff and then the serene to keep my

490
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,480
breath

491
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,160
fresh right next to the master bathroom

492
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,800
speaking of his and hers we have the

493
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,639
master

494
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,000
closet now this is one of the faces in

495
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,440
the house that actually took the most

496
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,360
time with the renovations because there

497
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,880
was a lot of work to be done in here

498
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,120
like i was mentioning it was a his and

499
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:20,320
hers type of situation and originally

500
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:22,880
this closet was the like his closet

501
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,440
used to be gray black very like dark and

502
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,880
dreary

503
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,880
and it actually had a door on it so we

504
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,279
opened up the entire wall we painted it

505
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,639
white

506
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,480
this is the closet where i keep all my

507
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,399
custom dressy or like costume

508
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,839
type pieces if you guys look around

509
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,199
there's a lot of really iconic moments

510
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,959
in here that you guys have seen at

511
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,240
coachella different red carpets

512
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,440
influencer as well

513
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,440
and i'm very much looking forward to

514
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,720
adding more pieces to this closet

515
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,320
as i do more exciting things in my

516
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,160
career and then coming right out of the

517
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,240
extravagant costume closet we have the

518
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:51,040
more everyday casual closet

519
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,160
and this is like my absolute dream a lot

520
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,079
of the other places that i've lived in

521
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,040
the past okay my downtown apartment then

522
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,560
my last home

523
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,480
did not really have the best closet

524
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,680
space literally in the last house i had

525
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,560

526
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,720
overflowing

527
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,240
so it is so nice to finally have a

528
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,079
massive closet where i can put

529
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,839

530
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,760

is the outdoor patio we have these

542
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,320
gorgeous

543
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,440
sliding glass doors which actually open

544
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,440

space i love these pocket doors and this

548
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,399
is one of my favorite places

549
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,920
of the entire house this patio actually

550
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,240
gets direct sunlight all day long which

551
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,000
is

552
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,839
so nice especially during these hot

553
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,040
months in the summer here in california

554
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,480
there's been so many afternoons where

555
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,839
i've laid out here tanning and like the

556
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,560
day beds which we got from restoration

557
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,079
hardware

558
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,079
and then once the sun goes down we have

559
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,160
these outdoor couches chairs as well

560
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,360
and this massive fireplace in the middle

561
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,959
where my friends and i can roast

562
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,920
marshmallows and then look up with the

563
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,759
stars in the sky
