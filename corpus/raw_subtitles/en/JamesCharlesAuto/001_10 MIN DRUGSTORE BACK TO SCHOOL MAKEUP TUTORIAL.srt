works and you guys will be seeing them

15
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,090

just film James we don't care and I know

17
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,609
you guys are always so supportive which

18
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,800
means the world to me

19
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:33,390
so you know I set my booty down and

20
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,860

21
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,390
your calendar it is officially August

22
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,040
which is absolutely horrifying because

23
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,480
summer is coming to a screeching halt

24
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,820
and you know it comes at the end of

25
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,410
summer school as many of you guys know I

26
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,059
did graduate early and I don't plan on

27
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,440
attending college so thank the Lord and

28
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:48,600
heaven above I will not be attending

29
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,149
school this year but I know so many of

30
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,920
you will and I myself did for 17 very

31
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:54,120
very long years so for today's to do I

32
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,649
sat down and we're gonna film a

33
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,399
back-to-school quick and easy makeup

34
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:57,539
tutorial

35
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,219
almost all the products I have in front

36
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:00,989
of me today are drugstore for those of

37
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:02,910
you who are on a budget I feel you girl

38
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:04,799
makeup can be super expensive when I was

39
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,630
in school four years ago lord knows I

40
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,340
did not have 42 dollars spent on a new

41
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:10,020
foundation that was going towards a new

42
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,090
textbook school is also super

43
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,350
time-consuming as well I know I had so

44
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,150
many nights staying up until 4:00 or

45
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:17,369
5:00 a.m. editing videos they're working

46
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,750
on a test or a paper or a project that I

47
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:21,060
had to wake up an hour later and get to

48
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,229
school so this video is also gonna be a

49
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,580
little bit of a challenge for anywhere

50
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:25,530
like I want to do this makeup look as

51
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,090
quickly as I possibly can I was gonna

52
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:28,890
limit myself to ten minutes but knowing

53
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,150
me let's be real instead of take a

54
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,829
little bit longer so I'm just gonna do

55
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,509
this pretty pretty quickly this is gonna

56
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:34,829
be a super easy light makeup routine

57
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:36,720
that you guys can use when you were

58
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:38,040
waking up Li ten minutes before your bus

59
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,869
gets here because we've all had those

60
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,430
days with all that being said good

61
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:44,009
morning sisters I hope you guys enjoy

62
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,600
your day in hell I mean school today and

63
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:47,369
without further ado let's get started on

64
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,360
this super easy everyday school makeup

65
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:51,510
routine

66
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,510
[Music]

67
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,479
all right sir I already went ahead and

68
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:56,770
prep my scan it by a showering of course

69
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:58,360
in the morning don't want to be stinky

70
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:59,920
for school and then I probably face

71
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,329
using my favorite moisturizer for

72
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,100
foundation today I'm gonna use the brand

73
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:05,619
new covergirl healthy elixir foundation

74
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:07,000
and I'm gonna mix a shade 725 and 745

75
00:02:05,619 --> 00:02:08,440
then of course I'm just gonna bounce

76
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,540
this into my skin at using my damp

77
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:15,160
Beauty Blender all that needs to not

78
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,810
happen so this foundation is definitely

79
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,519
a light to medium coverage foundation it

80
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:20,170
is definitely not full coverage glam

81
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:21,519
which is great though we definitely

82
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:24,040
don't need to be rocking a full coverage

83
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:25,330
HD foundation stick to high school it's

84
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,430
really not that serious we don't have

85
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:28,959
anybody to impress so don't worry about

86
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:30,519
it you can see my face today I'm using

87
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,260
the Maybelline fit me concealer in the

88
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:33,430
shade light if there's one thing that we

89
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:35,290
do definitely wanna focus on it is

90
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,700
probably gonna be concealer just make

91
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,110
sure we really hide any blemishes or

92
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,849
under-eye bags because I'm like I said

93
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:41,650
we are definitely gonna be a very very

94
00:02:39,849 --> 00:02:43,329
late working on papers and projects and

95
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:45,160
not getting very much sleep in school

96
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:47,110
I've been there before so let's do

97
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,099
everything we can to fix it and once

98
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:52,329
again just having my Beauty Blender and

99
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:53,410
I'm gonna pounce it into place school

100
00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:55,090
could definitely be super super

101
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:56,530
stressful as well and we have all woken

102
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:59,109
up with symbols before and stress

103
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:00,549
breakout so if you do get one never fear

104
00:02:59,109 --> 00:03:02,200
don't worry just grab your favorite

105
00:03:00,549 --> 00:03:04,569
concealer just put it over your pimple

106
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,680
just destroy this bit and then instead

107
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:07,569
of using a Beauty Blender I'm actually

108
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,459
gonna grab a very really light fluffy

109
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:11,109
brush and instead of a pouncing aunt I'm

110
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:13,329
just going to lightly tap over the area

111
00:03:11,109 --> 00:03:14,590
and just blend out those edges by doing

112
00:03:13,329 --> 00:03:16,030
this we're keeping the concealer exactly

113
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,859
where you want it to be right over the

114
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,970
pimple obviously so it's hidden and then

115
00:03:17,859 --> 00:03:21,280
just blending out those edges so it

116
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:22,540
looks natural because that my face in

117
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,670
place today are gonna be using the Cody

118
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,900
or some powder you guys know I

119
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,970
definitely have a very very interesting

120
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,319
history with this one but it wasn't

121
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:30,639
oldie but a goodie for the longest time

122
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:32,739
so I'm gonna try her again today

123
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:33,819
hopefully she won't do be dirty I'm just

124
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:35,709
gonna grab a little bit of powder really

125
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:39,819
lightly on my r-13 brush from morphe and

126
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:41,650
just set my under eyes in place that

127
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:42,910

128
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,139
more free to set the rest my face

129
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,700
I know Murphy's obviously not a

130
00:03:44,139 --> 00:03:47,470
drugstore brand that is sold in like CVS

131
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,450
or Walgreens or anything but their

132
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:50,560
products are super super cheap compared

133
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:52,540
to a lot of their competitors and they

134
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,040
are very very good as well and you guys

135
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,810

136
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,190

my lashes to prep them for mascara I'm

228
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:41,280
