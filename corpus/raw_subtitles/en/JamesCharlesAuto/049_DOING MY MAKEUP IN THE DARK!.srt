00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,360
hi sisters James Charles here and

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:04,650
welcome back to my youtube channel I

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,299
feel like it has been literally as so

4
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:07,710
long since I've lost in you guys I am so

5
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:09,599
sorry for the lack of videos that have

6
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,860
been coming out I've been so incredibly

7
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,500
busy with a lot of stuff of my personal

8
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,000
life but we're back we're ready to go

9
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,740
it has also been a long time since I've

10
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,199
worn a black leather baseball hat in the

11
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,310
video but you know what this is what

12
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,460
we're dealing with today

13
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:25,080
you're welcome for the Hat first today's

14
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,340
video I actually have a super fun at

15
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,800
challenge playing that I've never tried

16
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,240
before and I'm honestly absolutely

17
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,859
horrified to test out but you know what

18
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,059
it's probably gonna be really funny for

19
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:35,190
you guys to watch fun thing that is

20
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:37,710
super super vital to both beauty videos

21
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,879
and just makeup in general is light when

22
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,140
you guys watch my videos at home you get

23
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,440
to watch a very very nice and beautiful

24
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,750
pretty setup but I shoot with two huge

25
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,010
huge huge lights that are hanging right

26
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,390
above my head they're very very

27
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,370
expensive as well and they do a very

28
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,770
nice job of lighting this whole room and

29
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,329
making me look very very pretty so for

30
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,340
today's video what we're gonna do is

31
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:59,190
lose them and I'm gonna do my entire

32
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,270
face and makeup in the dark despite the

33
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:02,190
fact that I thought my videos the two

34
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,870
very very expensive lights I also film

35
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:05,850
it with a very very expensive camera

36
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,700
which upon further research I learned

37
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:11,460
does not have a nighttime mode of course

38
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,920
so to fix this problem I went to Best

39
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,299
Buy today and picked up this also very

40
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,009
very expensive camera that I'll probably

41
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:19,860
never use again that looks like it's

42
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:21,900
from 1984 but apparently it has a really

43
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,820
good at night mission mode so fingers

44
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,140
crossed that this video goes well I

45
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,520
thought of this challenge earlier on

46
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,259
today I thought it would be such a funny

47
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,490
video to do I've never seen it done

48
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:32,009
before but I looked it up and apparently

49
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,570
buzz we did it a few years ago so credit

50
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:35,400
to them do not attack me for stealing

51
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:37,380
and their video idea and without further

52
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,220
ado if you like to see me doing makeup

53
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:42,690
in complete darkness keep on watching

54
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:46,299
hello

55
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:48,500
[Music]

56
00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:50,000
so here that would be absolute pitch

57
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,409
block I've turned every single laid-off

58
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,940
in my apartment and closed all my

59
00:01:51,409 --> 00:01:55,100
curtains all I can see is just like

60
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:56,540
basic shapes and outlines and I have a

61
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,340
mirror right here okay know how because

62
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:02,810
I put it there and I'm looking in it and

63
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:05,300
I can see absolutely nothing so this

64
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:07,340
should be really great so not only can I

65
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:09,200
not see what I'm doing but for once in

66
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:10,759
my life today coincidentally I decided

67
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,220
to be organized and put everything back

68
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:14,930
in storage so I'm gonna pick up all my

69
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:16,910
makeup product support this video not

70
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:18,350
being able to see it what they are lord

71
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:21,440
please help me get to this without

72
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:22,610
another scandal let's go okay so first

73
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,940
we need a primer so I know that my

74
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:29,050
skincare drawer is right here I think I

75
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:31,970
know this is to touch a water cream okay

76
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:34,069
next is foundation which is English

77
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:35,690
right here Oh God

78
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:37,670
okay I know this is a makeup forever

79
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:39,680
sick but I have way too many shades of

80
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:44,180
that that is what are you too risky of a

81
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:45,370
game to be playing today oh I know

82
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:47,900
exactly what that is

83
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:49,670
that's cancelled okay I think this is

84
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,560
tuefel this way because I know the TF

85
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:53,570
logo is right on top and like engraved

86
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,950
letters but I have no idea what shade

87
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:58,160
this is and I just bought four new

88
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:59,570
shades so this might go really bad

89
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,989
really fast

90
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:04,940
next is a concealer which I know is over

91
00:03:01,989 --> 00:03:07,670
this is definitely thar shape tape this

92
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:09,769
feels very empty wait that's a good

93
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:13,750
thing that means I use it right welcome

94
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:13,750
to contour

95
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:28,570
definitely yeah so next set your blush

96
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:29,710
comes highlighter

97
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:31,900
why am I forgetting my makeup routine

98
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:38,080
discuss I'm in the dark okay that's

99
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:40,930
gonna be here okay this is the new

100
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:44,250
Anasazi I'm really a highlighter I think

101
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:49,140
I hope the next after hand later comes

102
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:54,610
brows which i think is right above my oh

103
00:03:49,140 --> 00:04:03,420
there's benefical brown eye shadow so

104
00:03:54,610 --> 00:04:06,340
let's head back down to the pallet or no

105
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:08,560
I want to do they get a worm tone kafka

106
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:10,350
crease I obviously do those a lot so I

107
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,120
think I know the technique behind that

108
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:15,460
and I think that'll be relatively okay

109
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:21,360
leader try to replicate tonight I have

110
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:26,820
no ideas or that or that

111
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:29,050
this feels dirty really really dirty

112
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:30,580
okay this is definitely multi palette oh

113
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:33,340
I think this might be the John help out

114
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:36,100
oh this is definitely the 39a this is

115
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:37,330
too big to be a regular palette hello so

116
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,860
I'm gonna go ahead and pick this palette

117
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:40,150
I know that this one is a 39a but I

118
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,590
actually don't have the shades like

119
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,330
memorized so I'm too scared of doing

120
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:44,830
something very ugly with that and I

121
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:46,720
think that this might be the John help

122
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:49,870
out so this one that looks like it'd be

123
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,160
a good contender hopefully so next I

124
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:53,890
need an eyeliner which I know is right

125
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,240
above the eyebrow drawer so that would

126
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:58,270
be here

127
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:01,960
I think yeah right here

128
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:05,010
Oh what did I just do uh-oh I doesn't

129
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:09,090
want to attempt to do a full on it

130
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:10,890
so I'm looking for a black liquid liner

131
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:12,750
I have no idea how ever gonna find oh

132
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:17,010
just kidding this is the Kat Von D

133
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:18,480
tattoo liner thing though Oh what is all

134
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:26,360
these drawers not closing what is my eye

135
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:38,220
oh setting spray I definitely need ah oh

136
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:40,560
let's grab yes that's is lips oh god

137
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:49,890
this to go really wrong let's call this

138
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:51,210
one oh my god not sad I say and I'm

139
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:53,490
gonna start by priming my face that I

140
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:55,920
used in what I hope is my top shot water

141
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:57,900
cream moisturizer I really really love

142
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,730
this and it is really really great

143
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,380
that's low buddy feels so gross because

144
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:03,570
I'm so it's taking addressed right now

145
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:06,330
like this is not what I want to be doing

146
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:10,260
but this is either born this way or it

147
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:11,790
could also be luminous silk thank you

148
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:15,120
guys so I hate that foundation I'm gonna

149
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:15,840
do three pumps there it is on the back

150
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,140
of my hand

151
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,290
Oh yup there's defecation there uh-huh

152
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:21,030
uh-huh

153
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:22,140
I think this is very similar to the no

154
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:23,550
mirror makeup challenge being that I

155
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,870
obviously cannot see what I'm doing

156
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:27,540
except for the fact that there is a

157
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:29,580
mirror right there I just still can't

158
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:30,900
see myself definitely needs for me to

159
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,370
blend on the neck because if this is the

160
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,230
wrong foundation shade that's gonna be

161
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:37,620
our only saving grace that might

162
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:41,010
disguise it a little bit okay so next up

163
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:43,820
is going to be our concealer which no

164
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:47,100
definitely not concealer is right here

165
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:51,030
okay oh this is definitely shaved table

166
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:55,740
uh-huh I'd done the nose bridge bring it

167
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:57,600
em out same thing on the other side oh

168
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:59,670
that's my eyeball the key to this house

169
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,290
definitely gonna be to blend blend blend

170
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:03,120
blend blend because clearly I cannot see

171
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:06,780
anything that's going on I know there's

172
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:10,680
a mirror right there but I won't

173
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:11,270
then comes Beautyblender dip it right in

174
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,160

175
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:15,300

00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:18,300
next comes contour which i know i have

00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:28,410

185
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:38,370

186
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,080

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,850
like blue eye shadow on it holy crap I'm

189
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:58,350

which is right about here how do you

191
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:02,970
just oh how do you just sit there

192
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:05,360
whether you're annoying a scar and just

193
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:08,270
let it hunk like that for like an hour

194
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:11,790
it's in just going and going and going

195
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:14,280
collect your car this has been a PSI I

196
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:16,380
need to move now next we're gonna do

197
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:19,740
some highlighter quickly and we're gonna

198
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:25,410
use what I hope is the Anasazi rocks are

199
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:28,979
easy new highlighter oh you see that

200
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:30,840
glow me either okay also gonna go put it

201
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:36,240
right above the brow bone like always

202
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:37,500
okay that should be good

203
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,289
I'm gonna get my Beauty Blender again

204
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:41,729
and dip it into oh shoot I'm gonna judge

205
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:43,260
by the noise of all the snot and right

206
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:45,630
now is that I'm definitely hitting the

207
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:50,070
right place okay so now it is eyebrows

208
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:51,630
heavy time horrified for but let's do

209
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:54,780
this I'm gonna start off in the front

210
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:56,190
and bring it up towards the tail which i

211
00:08:54,780 --> 00:09:02,250
think is over here

212
00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:07,650
I hope bring it out then back up I'm

213
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:09,030
scared now just lean up underneath my

214
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:10,680
eyebrows which I know I need my Mac I

215
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,330
like to cover up for so I'm gonna put

216
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,600
this on

217
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:16,730
the back of my hand a little squirt and

218
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,460
I also need a flattop concealer brush

219
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:24,980
which should be amazing try to find in

220
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:26,780
this it says my eyebrow bone yeah oh my

221
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:28,310
god my eyelids feel why this is gross

222
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,330
okay so next is the part that I'm

223
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:32,480
absolutely dreading and that I'm sure

224
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:33,890
you're all upset for the eyeshadow like

225
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,510
I said I have no idea what problems even

226
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:37,520
as dangerous cross said it's a Jocelyn

227
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:40,340
Hill palette I have a strong inkling

228
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:42,320
that it may be but I could be very very

229
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:43,820
wrong so if this is about that I think

230
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,110
it is I do use this palette quite a lot

231
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:47,900
so I think I have a pretty good idea of

232
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:50,360
where the colors are and I think that

233
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:53,150
the third shade from the top is a light

234
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:56,150
transition shade wait is it the one

235
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:57,950
below it I can really cannot tell where

236
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:59,450
my actual creases this is not good I

237
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:01,010
usually do one eye at a time but I don't

238
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:03,080
trust myself to remember the colors that

239
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:04,220
I use and I also definitely did not

240
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,380
trust myself to be able to find the

241
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:08,240
brushes again in a few minutes so I

242
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:11,390
guess we're gonna do both eyes at the

243
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:15,170
same time oh god just keep blending just

244
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:17,450
keep blending blending blending oh love

245
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:19,340
that sister voice crack here next gonna

246
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:25,070
grab another fluffy brush and try to

247
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:26,990
deepen up the this feels like an m4 33

248
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:31,620
okay well the right chalk I'm gonna

249
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:32,920
place this right on my outer area

250
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,880
[Music]

251
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,200
imagine I think I'm doing like a warm

252
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,400
tone half cut crease and by the end of

253
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,680
the video I turn the lights on and I

254
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:42,110
have a blue smokey eye on with my luck I

255
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,400
wouldn't even be surprised okay so now

256
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:45,710
that we have the crease colors all in

257
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:48,320
place I'm gonna take the Stila liquid

258
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:57,110
metals in whatever shade this is and I'm

259
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:58,970
going to carve out my crease aha oh I

260
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:02,030
think that was to go to crease cutting I

261
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:04,090
felt that one even in the dark you're

262
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:06,280
still gonna have our little fan

263
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:11,660
okay and next I'm just going to be

264
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:14,510
winged liner which is oh right here Oh

265
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:18,050
if this look turned out any sort of good

266
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:20,150
by some miracle this is where this is

267
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:28,490
where we lose it sisters

268
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:29,690
oh hey that could be good I think this I

269
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:31,850
might be a lot easier this is always my

270
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:33,470
better eye for eyeliner oh I forgot to

271
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:35,510
fill it in no I'm gonna leave it at that

272
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:37,220
okay we're almost done

273
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:38,240
thank God it is getting so dark I'm

274
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:41,900
literally falling asleep while doing

275
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:46,850
this next up we have lashes God let's

276
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:48,950
undo the pasta oh god I forgot about the

277
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:52,490
whole tweezer situation wait I have to

278
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:54,110
cut these two scissors in the dark

279
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:59,150
sounds like the worst idea ever in the

280
00:11:54,110 --> 00:12:06,380
entire world though that's my finger

281
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:07,160
okay oh that does not feel right she's

282
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,430
on there

283
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:14,310
[Music]

284
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:17,060
I think oh hello

285
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:19,800
okay I feel like that could be

286
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:22,320
relatively correct this whole area feels

287
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:24,450
very very sticky which is telling me

288
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,970
that I probably got glue in an area that

289
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:27,630
should not contain glue and now I'm

290
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:30,410
concerned

291
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:33,000
okay now that lashes are all are we have

292
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:35,339
mascara and for this I think I picked

293
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,279
out my benefit roller lash if I am

294
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:40,500
correct so I'm going to oh god oh god

295
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:42,450
I'm actually horrified of this between

296
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,950
West carrot with lights on is literally

297
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:45,270
already scary enough and I'm somehow me

298
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:47,339
editing to do this in complete darkness

299
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:48,779
you know what if I poked myself I'm

300
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:53,520
already pretty much blind at this point

301
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:57,510
I might as well finish it off oh just

302
00:12:53,520 --> 00:13:00,540
like that oh and last but certainly not

303
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:02,580
least we have lipstick which i think is

304
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:05,250
an overlook of lipstick I really it

305
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:06,960
could not see or smell much but with a

306
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:11,100
little amount of nasal passageway I have

307
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:14,130
left Oh nope this is shave tape we have

308
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:15,630
lipstick which i think is Oprah yeah

309
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:21,360
definitely over a house that very like

310
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:25,980
cupcake e-type smell uh-huh uh-huh got a

311
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:29,910
over line just a little bit oh that was

312
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:33,320
a lot a bit okay I think we're done

313
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:33,320
oh we have to set our face in place okay

314
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:39,420
okay I think I'm ready for the reveal

315
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:47,730
I'm honestly horrified but let's her

316
00:13:39,420 --> 00:14:04,170
night vision off one two three oh my god

317
00:13:47,730 --> 00:14:06,270
oh that was a lot okay hello oh oh oh

318
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:08,490
god I'm scared

319
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:11,160
this is interesting it just at least

320
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:13,290
lets go back through it step by step we

321
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,790
started off with touch of water cream I

322
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:17,310
was right it frickin love this thing

323
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:19,170
then to phrase boils my foundation I was

324
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:23,670
right once again it warm nude this

325
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:25,529
happens to be my shade thank God next

326
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:28,260
was tart shaped tape this is in the

327
00:14:25,529 --> 00:14:30,480
shade light/medium laura mercier that

328
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:33,570
was correct looks like I forgot to wipe

329
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:36,690
off my bake apparently that is just fine

330
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:38,070
and dandy not surprised we use candy

331
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:39,839
shade and light palette they'll be

332
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:41,550
pretty hard to freakin it miss this one

333
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,700
in my palette or considering it is

334
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:47,640
broken and open and barely existing

335
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:50,100
anymore for highlighter we did grab the

336
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:53,250
Anasazi I'm lazy highlighter it is

337
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:55,230
definitely looking blinding to say the

338
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:57,810
least really love this super flattering

339
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:59,970
placement of all over my cheek that I

340
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:02,580
went with today okay let me know why

341
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:03,000
this eyebrow is low-key like kind of

342
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:05,700
good

343
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,470
this sister over here she's struggling

344
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:10,200
let's be real but this one over here

345
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:11,370
like she's doing it okay so next is

346
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,080
eyeshadow and we did end up with the

347
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:17,010
Johnson help Allah thank God I was right

348
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:18,480
I'm not I ended up picking okay yeah the

349
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:20,610
transition shade which is right here and

350
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,620
then this shade right here I think if I

351
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:24,000
remember correctly which is the shades

352
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:25,320
that I wanted to go with definitely not

353
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,890
the half cut crease that we were going

354
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:32,250
for but doesn't look that bad next was

355
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:33,810
eyeliner which turned out and trusting

356
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:35,820
to say the least she comes to a nice

357
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:37,350
little point definitely is a little bit

358
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:39,120
wonky in this region it definitely could

359
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:41,420
be a little bit sharper like ready to

360
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,980
cut somebody but you know why she's

361
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:44,720
she's a struggle Wang she's like

362
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:46,940
flopping in the wind she's like not like

363
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,370
airborne yet but like she's trying she's

364
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:52,550
like the chicken of the wagons lying on

365
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:54,050
her that was a horrible joke also loved

366
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:56,450
that I completely forgot to do with

367
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:58,040
lower lashline eye shadow good job James

368
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:59,330
I think the best result out of the

369
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:03,020
entire face though is the lips like

370
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:05,090
Hello look at these they look so good I

371
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:07,070
thought at one point my lipstick slipped

372
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:10,160
and I Overland way too much but

373
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:12,380
apparently I overlay my lips a lot on a

374
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,540
regular makeup basis because these look

375
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:16,190
pretty good I'm proud of myself for that

376
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,570
one not just for sure not gonna lie I

377
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:19,970
really did not have high hopes for this

378
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:21,170
challenge at all I think this is kind of

379
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:22,430
like the no mirror makeup challenge and

380
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:25,280
that you can't see what you're doing at

381
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:27,740
all but also I did not pick up the

382
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:29,030
makeup products prior either so picking

383
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,910
all of these could have really easily

384
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:33,680
been a huge disaster but that just tells

385
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:35,360
me that I am way too addicted to makeup

386
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,100
and know way too much about all the

387
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,720
products that I use on an everyday basis

388
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,100
because I feel like I did a very very

389
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,370
good job of picking out products that I

390
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:45,980
would normally use so I guess good job

391
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:46,820
to myself for that I definitely want you

392
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,950
