least a little bit and I am a back home

21
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:51,050
I finally have some time to sit down and

22
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:52,820
film for you guys and get back into the

23
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:55,729
Halloween groove today I decided to film

24
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:58,280
this super drag super glam a Playboy

25
00:00:55,729 --> 00:01:00,199
bunny inspired look I absolutely love

26
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,790
how this turned out I posted it on my

27
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:03,170
instigator day and everybody was

28
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:04,489
commenting asked me to film it so of

29
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:06,500
course I had to sit down and teach you

30
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:08,630
guys how to do this look full credit and

31
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,580
inspiration for this look goes to jubu

32
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:12,500
or instagram will be right here she is

33
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:14,659
so talented and she did this first so

34
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,310
this is inspired by her also this video

35
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:17,510
is a collaboration with one of my best

36
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:20,420
friends in the entire world

37
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:22,370
Tina helada or tutorials by Tina she's a

38
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:25,130
15 year old makeup artist and she is

39
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:27,620
beyond talented so we decided to team up

40
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:30,410
and do two different styles so Tina

41
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:32,060
decided to do a more toned town glam and

42
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:33,590
definitely easier version of this look

43
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,240
if you want to see how she created hers

44
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:38,060
make sure you click right here tell her

45
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:40,070
Jane sent you she is amazing as for my

46
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:41,960
look cover we always got to be extra 8

47
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:44,090
up on this channel you guys know that I

48
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,550
never do anything toned down so this is

49
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:48,260
the look I came up with this dry glam

50
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:49,610
inspired a Playboy bunny and if you want

51
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,720
to see how I created it make sure you

52
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,790
keep on watching

53
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,070
hi guys to begin this tutorial today I'm

54
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:56,300
gonna start off by covering my brows now

55
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,410
this technique is definitely not the

56
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,940
easiest thing in the world so if you

57
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:00,680
Argan do this for Halloween please make

58
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:02,720
sure you practice beforehand it can be

59
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,340
very very tricky I'm just using a

60
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,659
regular glue stick and a brushing all

61
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,820
the glue into my brow hairs and then

62
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:09,349
combing every hair up with a spoolie on

63
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,789
the end of a brow brush to really make

64
00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:13,220
sure they are flat to my face and every

65
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:14,780
hair is separated and going upwards then

66
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:16,730
I'm just going to take a damp towel and

67
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,950
kind of go over the edges of the glue to

68
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:20,629
blend them into my skin sometimes it can

69
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:21,620
be a pretty textured and lumpy so like I

70
00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:25,069
said we really want to make sure these

71
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:26,689
are flat to create a new layer of skin

72
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:27,150
then I'm just going to do the same thing

73
00:02:26,689 --> 00:02:29,190
on the

74
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:30,750
bro and once that is coated in dry I'm

75
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,400
just gonna continue to lay our glue and

76
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,049
then finding it letting it dry it

77
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,000
between three or four times depending on

78
00:02:34,049 --> 00:02:37,319
how thick your actual brows are until

79
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,360
you get the desired coverage to where

80
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:40,890
you feel they are good then I'm going to

81
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,090
set my brow hairs in place using Kody

82
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:43,680
airspun this is my favorite setting

83
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,540
powder and just a regular powder puff to

84
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,860
really press that powder in there once

85
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,230
again to make sure they are very very

86
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:51,510
flat and not textured then I'm using my

87
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:52,200
morphe 48 brush to brush away the excess

88
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:54,090
hairs

89
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,010
now to begin covering the brows I'm

90
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:58,170
going to use my Mac painterly paint-pot

91
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:59,670
this Paint Pot is super super pigmented

92
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:02,160
I'm just brushing it on with the morphe

93
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:04,079
r32 brush to really pack that color on

94
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,180
there I love this because it really

95
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:07,980
covers the texture and the color of the

96
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,959
brows which can be very very hard if you

97
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,760
have huge ass caterpillar brows like I

98
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:13,950
do so I would definitely recommend this

99
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,480
step then I'm gonna prime my face using

100
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:17,579
a benefit professional you guys know I

101
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,810
love this primer this entire tutorial is

102
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:20,579
gonna be very very out of order I

103
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:21,810
apologize this is just kind of the way I

104
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:23,940
did things and it worked out pretty well

105
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:25,709
so follow along if you choose or just do

106
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,420
whatever you want and then using that

107
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:29,549
same Paint Pot actually to start to

108
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:31,500
paint my nose now this technique was

109
00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:32,910
recommended to me by a follower and you

110
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,919
guys always know that I complain about

111
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:36,299
foundations something off my nose so

112
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:37,590
this technique has really saved the lane

113
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:39,660
of my nose contour and really helps

114
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:41,639
everything to stay in place all day long

115
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:43,139
it doesn't wear out then I'm just using

116
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:45,030
a damp Beauty Blender to kind of blend

117
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:46,829
over the edges of the nose and the

118
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,510
eyebrow cover I'm then just gonna start

119
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:49,980
my regular foundation routine as always

120
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:51,480
is my makeup over Ultra HD foundation

121
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:54,000
stick I'm just gonna put this all over

122
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,049
my face including my brows and my nose

123
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,599
we really want to make sure there is

124
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:58,919
even coverage and no discoloration and

125
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,720
then I'm just gonna blend that in very

126
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:02,220
very carefully using my morphe 439

127
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,599
foundation brush this is one of my

128
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:05,669
favorite foundation brushes ever it is

129
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,470
so great and you can use code James for

130
00:04:05,669 --> 00:04:09,180
10% off all morphe brushes and products

131
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:10,620
you guys know I absolutely love them and

132
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,699
stand behind them 100% so you should

133
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,769
definitely check them out if you have

134
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:15,389
not already and then I'm just going into

135
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:17,160
my Too Faced Born This Way concealer to

136
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:18,209
put it in the high points on my face and

137
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,099
then blending that out with the damp

138
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:22,260
Beauty Blender to really get everything

139
00:04:20,099 --> 00:04:23,699
it's snatched then you look absolutely

140
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,830
horrifying and you get to make this face

141
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:28,110
in the mirror and at this point you are

142
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:29,910
ready to set your face once again I'm

143
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:31,979
using a Kody era spot and a powder puff

144
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:34,020
just to pack it on I'm starting off in

145
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:35,350
the kind of baked areas like the

146
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,940
eyebrows and then on

147
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:38,650
the eyes and then I'm just going in and

148
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,810
just kind of slopping this everywhere to

149
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:44,530
really make sure I am a full face matte

150
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:46,480
and definitely not oily or wet anywhere

151
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:47,890
to begin sketching out the eye of the

152
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,600
bunny I'm using my makeup forever flash

153
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:51,910
palette the white shade obviously and my

154
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,440
morphe m15 a brush to begin kind of

155
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:55,390
drawing it in place where I want it I'm

156
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,920
going to draw a line upwards problem at

157
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:59,050
the corner of my eye and then from the

158
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:00,850
inner corner of my nose and then kind of

159
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:03,220
connect it sort of similar to the way we

160
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:07,150
draw a cut crease just a lot bigger and

161
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:08,320
more draggy if that makes any sense I'm

162
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,490
really making sure to pack a lot of

163
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,350
product on there because we want this

164
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:13,360
white to be super opaque obviously we

165
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:15,580
can go over and clean it up later on in

166
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,040
the future and then I'm gonna take the

167
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:20,200
anasazi liquid lipstick shades in pure

168
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:22,090
Hollywood and blush mixing them together

169
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:24,040
on an angled brush and sketching that

170
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:26,410
right over the white line we just drew

171
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:28,930
this is gonna be kind of the I guess

172
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:30,310
eyebrow of the bunny I don't really know

173
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:32,110
what it is but it looks cute so we

174
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:33,880
decided to do it and it was in the

175
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:35,740
original book by jubu as I said before

176
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,300
so I really really loved what she did

177
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:39,580
and I wanted to recreate it as

178
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,170
accurately as possible I'm just

179
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,430
following the same exact shape as the

180
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:43,840
white line that I created below while

181
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:45,670
making it a lot thicker and then a

182
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,820
tapering it off in the inner corner to

183
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:50,770
create that classic drag effect I'm not

184
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:52,300
gonna use my morphe amma 4-3-3 brush and

185
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:54,040
the anasazi a single shadow and shade

186
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,900
babycakes and kind of said that liquid

187
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,370
lipstick in place I know it will dry but

188
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,590
I really want to make sure this is super

189
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:01,480
super exactly there and where we needed

190
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:03,760
to be and the nurse going back over with

191
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:05,410
my m15 e as I said before from morphe

192
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,660
and the same white shade to really make

193
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:10,900
sure those lines are opaque and very

194
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:12,640
very sharp and defined then to begin the

195
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:15,190
upper fur of the eye on once again using

196
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:16,270
the same brush same shape same color

197
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:17,650
from the flash palette and I'm just

198
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:19,840
going to follow that pink line exactly

199
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:21,940
but I'm going to start sketching in some

200
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,980
fur this time I'm really making sure to

201
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:25,690
pack a lot of product on there this

202
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:27,400
product while they are great can be very

203
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:29,260
very wet so sometimes I find that it can

204
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,640
kind of drag the foundation along with

205
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:32,110
it so really make sure you're putting a

206
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,330
lot of product on there so when you drag

207
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:35,890
out the fur you're not dragging out the

208
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:39,430
foundation with you and your fur remains

209
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:40,780
white and super clean to set the fern

210
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:42,820
place I'm going to be using my Ben Nye

211
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:44,200
super wet face powder on a flat to find

212
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:46,300
a Russian just packing this right into

213
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:48,680
the fur to make sure it is dry and super

214
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:50,690
opaque and white and then one of my

215
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,759
and while mega liner in white it is a

216
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:54,590
super precise and thin liner which I

217
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:55,970
love and I'm just using this to draw in

218
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:58,009
some more furs and some tiny little

219
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:59,419
hairs this adds a lot more dimension to

220
00:06:58,009 --> 00:07:01,880
the look which previously was not

221
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:03,740
possible with the flash palette and then

222
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,360
using this tiny Mac definer brush in my

223
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,680
Kat Von D shade and light palette I'm

224
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,600
using the shade all the way to the left

225
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,250
to add in some shadowing to the cut

226
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,690
crease I'm just placing the shade

227
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,789
lightly underneath the white lines that

228
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:15,620
we created earlier on the cut crease so

229
00:07:13,789 --> 00:07:17,150
above the top line as well as the lower

230
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:19,039
line where the liner will be in a second

231
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:21,020
this just creates some more dimension

232
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,580
and kind of looks like it's like a mask

233
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:24,680
that is popping off my face so I really

234
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:26,539
like how it looks for the liner today

235
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,280
I'm gonna be using my Kat Von D trooper

236
00:07:26,539 --> 00:07:30,380
liner this liner is super precise and

237
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:32,360
thin so I really do love it and I use it

238
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:34,370
all the time which you guys know this

239
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,960
liner today was giving me a lot of

240
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:37,729
trouble I ended up redoing it and fixing

241
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,979
it like five or ten times I don't know

242
00:07:37,729 --> 00:07:41,660
why I'm not used to making liner this

243
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:43,370
big but it is a dried look so you got to

244
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,900
do what you got to do and then I'm going

245
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:46,669
back in once again with that mega liner

246
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:49,099
from Wet n Wild and just sketching in

247
00:07:46,669 --> 00:07:51,410
some more hairs over top of that pink

248
00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:52,610
area I am however keeping these hairs a

249
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:54,710
little bit smaller than the previous

250
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:58,220
ones because we are gonna be adding some

251
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:59,690
glitter whoa who doesn't love glitter me

252
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,949
actually I really don't like glitter

253
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:02,210
because it's dirty and once you get

254
00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:03,800
glitter in your life you literally never

255
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:05,419
can get glitter out but that's aside

256
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,340
from the point under stating my makeup

257
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:09,169
forever mist and fix spray and then some

258
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:11,030
dollar-store glitter on my morphe I'm at

259
00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:12,949
242 brush and just packing this right

260
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:14,599
onto the pink area this adds a lot of

261
00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:16,220
texture and dimension let's be real it's

262
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:19,099
pretty so you got included the glitter

263
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:20,479
for a drag look to finish off this I am

264
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:21,830
then going back into the white from the

265
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,570
frost palette and filling in my

266
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:25,400
waterline as well as a lower lash line

267
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:27,050
and then to shading once again with that

268
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,150
mock brush and the Kat Von D shade and

269
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:31,849
light palette add some final dimension

270
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:32,900
and that completes one eye of this bunny

271
00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:34,400
look going to go ahead and do the other

272
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:36,620
one off Cara then we can go ahead and

273
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,209
finish off the rest of the face for my

274
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:40,339
lashes today I'm puffing on a violet

275
00:08:38,209 --> 00:08:42,020
boss lashes in the style I to hose you

276
00:08:40,339 --> 00:08:43,279
guys know that I absolutely love these I

277
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,899
always wear these for my bigger look

278
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,209
such as like cut creases and drag books

279
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:49,430
they're just perfect and mice and wispy

280
00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:51,140
for my lower lashes I'm popping on

281
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:53,149
janessa my Rx lashes in the style of

282
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:54,620
thrive zero ones these are really just

283
00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:56,089
gonna help to open my eye and kind of

284
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,589
further that whole drag effect and I'm

285
00:08:56,089 --> 00:08:58,510
just popping those on or right below the

286
00:08:57,589 --> 00:09:00,790
white and the

287
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:02,920
line I'm then going in and starting to

288
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,300
contour my face is my morphe and 435

289
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,800
brush and my Kat Von D shade and light

290
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,880
palette I'm not going to help you

291
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,829
because we are going to be covering a

292
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,600
lot of the face with some more fur but I

293
00:09:08,829 --> 00:09:12,940
am going to go pretty heavy on my jaw

294
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,560
line even though we are cute Playboy

295
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:17,079
bunny we still want to be as snatched as

296
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,850
how as always so I am a packing on the

297
00:09:17,079 --> 00:09:21,160
bronzer and really making sure to chisel

298
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:23,139
out my jaw and then just gonna go in and

299
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,730
quickly bake my contour with my echo

300
00:09:23,139 --> 00:09:26,320
tiara spot and a powder puff like I said

301
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,579
before not focusing too hard because we

302
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,949
are going to be covering a lot of it in

303
00:09:27,579 --> 00:09:32,560
fur next I'm just going with my morphe M

304
00:09:29,949 --> 00:09:33,760
509 brush and a little bit of blush we

305
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,230
are gonna be using a pink highlighter

306
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,149
today from the Anasazi at moonchild

307
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:38,470
palette so this just really helps blend

308
00:09:37,149 --> 00:09:40,540
everything together and make sure that

309
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:42,699
glow is super pink and of course I'm

310
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:45,190
using a pink heart from ABH moonchild

311
00:09:42,699 --> 00:09:46,899
like I said then you start the facial

312
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:48,279
fur I'm just going into the white color

313
00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:49,720
from the makeup rubber flash palette

314
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:51,399
same thing as before and that definer

315
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:54,010
brush and just sketching it where I want

316
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:55,180
the facial fur oh my god this voiceovers

317
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,230
literally such a mess it is so late at

318
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,279
night and I want to get this video oh

319
00:09:56,230 --> 00:10:00,160
and I feel like I'm barely speaking

320
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,360
English anymore please bear with me once

321
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,740
I have that in place I'm then just going

322
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,750
back in and starting to fill that in and

323
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:06,010
similar to it defer above the eyebrows

324
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,569
I'm really making sure to put a lot of

325
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:09,100
that product on there because sometimes

326
00:10:07,569 --> 00:10:11,139
it does move around so we want to make

327
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:14,350
sure we have white fur and not like

328
00:10:11,139 --> 00:10:15,760
off-white skin color type fur then for

329
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,959
the nose I'm just using the same mixture

330
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,880
from before or those two liquid

331
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,990
lipsticks from ABH they are blush and

332
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,630
pure Hollywood and I'm just sketching

333
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:24,639
out the nose with a tiny angled definer

334
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:26,769
brush and I'm just going from Nashville

335
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:29,350
to Nashville and then filling the tip of

336
00:10:26,769 --> 00:10:30,819
the nose in and then a similar to the

337
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:33,490
pink up crease I'm setting that with the

338
00:10:30,819 --> 00:10:34,959
Anasazi eye shadow and babycakes for my

339
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:36,130
lips today I'm going to be using Anasazi

340
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,750
Lucca lipstick in the shade a pure

341
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:39,399
Hollywood it just to fill in my top lip

342
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:41,380
I am over drawing a little bit but

343
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:42,610
making sure not to go overboard and then

344
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:44,829
I'm going to set that in place in my

345
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:46,120
Anasazi on babycakes single shadow as

346
00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:47,589
well as setting the bottom lip would

347
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,970
that been my super white powder to make

348
00:10:47,589 --> 00:10:51,190
sure those two colors did not transfer

349
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:53,649
onto each other to finish off I'm going

350
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:55,779
into my morphe and to 50.0 liner brush

351
00:10:53,649 --> 00:10:57,519
and some black gel liner to draw a thin

352
00:10:55,779 --> 00:10:59,019
line from the tip of the nose down to

353
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,069
the Cupid's bow and then finishing off

354
00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:02,500
with some dots where the bunny's

355
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:04,930
whiskers would go alright guys and that

356
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,890
it's a completed drag Playboy bunny

357
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,089
inspired makeup

358
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:08,200
