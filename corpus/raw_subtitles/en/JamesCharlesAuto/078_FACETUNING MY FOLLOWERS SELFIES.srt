00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,780
hi sisters team Charles here and welcome

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:05,370
back to my youtube channel first today's

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,680
video we're gonna be doing something so

4
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,450
crazy that no beauty guru has ever done

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,190
before and that none of us really like

6
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,179
to talk about and that is face tuning

7
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,040
you guys know I'm definitely the

8
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:15,870
self-proclaimed queen of face to it

9
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,010
let's be real I am very very very good

10
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,420
at it and if you guys see me on

11
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,520
Instagram you would know that a sister

12
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:22,260
loves a good tune I just really really

13
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,400
love a photo editing and in my opinion

14
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,170
as long as you're not editing a makeup

15
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,670
actually on a photo editing and

16
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,320
retouching is just as much of an art as

17
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,150
actual makeup itself I've literally

18
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,650
become so known for facesitting at this

19
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,960
point that not only do i edit my own

20
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,280
photos but so many different Instagram

21
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,870
celebrities and youtubers that you guys

22
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,730
all know and love I will not release any

23
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,200
names but also some of their photos to

24
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,399
edit to so half the time that you guys

25
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,510
are seeing are really bomb photo on

26
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,030
Instagram especially if it involves

27
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,890
makeup probably went through me first as

28
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,840
well though I also always get a ton of

29
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,879
questions from you guys about different

30
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,230
editing tips tricks and techniques and a

31
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,520
few descried tweeted on Twitter asking

32
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,199
what if I did a video where I edited

33
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,670
your guys's southies and it got like a

34
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,760
40,000 likes or something absolutely

35
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,230
crazy so for today's video I tweeted

36
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,180
asking you babes to tell me your

37
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,890
unedited and makeup selfies something

38
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,689
that you want fixed and call me crazy

39
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,400
but I'm gonna facetune your guys's

40
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:09,869
selfies just a quick little just simmer

41
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,369
before we get really into this video if

42
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:13,590
you're someone who does not believe or

43
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:15,509
enjoy a photo editing um please do me a

44
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,130
favor and click the little X button

45
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:18,180
right up here we do not need you here

46
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:20,310
and I definitely do not want any

47
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,080
annoying comments this video is just for

48
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,729
fun I want to make it very clear that

49
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,229
like I said beforehand I view photo

50
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:27,240
editing is this as much of an art form

51
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:29,310
as actual makeup itself but I will never

52
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,390
actually edit makeup on when you're

53
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,380
taking selfies there's a lot of

54
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:33,299
different variables that can really

55
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,860
affect the final photo such as lighting

56
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:36,329
the environment that you're in the angle

57
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,520
that the photo was taken it and the

58
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:39,750
actual camera you're using so what I'm

59
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,670
editing pictures I only like to make

60
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,810
this selfie that already exists a little

61
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,189
bit better using photo editing

62
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,140
techniques but I never will actually add

63
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:48,000
makeup and I never change my face to

64
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,350
where I'm not recognizable anymore for

65
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,850
me personally you guys know I love a

66
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:52,049
good face to moment and I am very very

67
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:53,850
open and honest about the fact that my

68
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:55,649
photos are all very very edited but at

69
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,689
the same time you guys see me on YouTube

70
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:59,219
every single week unedited and raw and

71
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:01,079
also on snapchat and Instagram stories

72
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:02,579
all day long and a lot of you met me in

73
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,140
person too so it's not like I'm really

74
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:05,759
trying to hide anything there is nothing

75
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,990
wrong with fixing any insecurities and

76
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,489
making your highlight really pop in a

77
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,080
photo or making your eyeshadow colors a

78
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:11,400
little bit more vibrant as long as

79
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,569
you're not crossing any lines and as

80
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,209
long as you're open and honest about it

81
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:22,590
so without further adieu all that is out

82
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:24,209
of the way let's jump into the video all

83
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,230
right guys let's jump right in the first

84
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:26,910
response we have to this tweet is a

85
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:28,830
sister Katie Bruce Lamora another fellow

86
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:34,140
Beauty influencer and he said can you

87
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:35,580
fix my flashback oh no unfortunately if

88
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,080
this were fixable I wouldn't have this

89
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,849
candle in the first place okay so

90
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,430
seriously now for the first time sister

91
00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:43,290
Zoe said fix my nose please and thanks

92
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:45,360
and she said and this selfie right here

93
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:47,010
Wow a sister looks beautiful and snot

94
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,450
that's good and Sasha snows up just a

95
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:49,920
little bit more alright so let's go

96
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:52,290
ahead and open the photo and face tune

97
00:02:49,920 --> 00:03:00,239
and we're first gonna stock with sister

98
00:02:52,290 --> 00:03:01,290
reshape skinnier than Mariah so first

99
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,849
what I want to do is go ahead and take

100
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:04,980
this smooth tool and I want to go over

101
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:06,510
all of a sister Zoe skin to kind of

102
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,890
create an even base all throughout

103
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:09,090
especially when it comes to it the nose

104
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:10,349
region usually you guys know I like to

105
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,489
just have everything in because if it

106
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:12,989
looks too smooth that looks very very

107
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:14,940
fake and cross it and bust it and

108
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:16,260
they're gonna get clocked a real fast

109
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,550
first sister to date and even though I

110
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:21,330
like to edit my photos the house down

111
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:23,879
boots I like to look them as real as

112
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:25,890
possible next I want to do is grab the

113
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:27,510
tones tool and then grab Hicker and I

114
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:29,310
want to pick the lightest tan color

115
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:30,540
right on the center of her cheek and I'm

116
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,790
gonna go back to tones and then I'm

117
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:35,400
going to lightly tap on this light tan

118
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:37,739
color all around her cheek area and on

119
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,180
to the side of Zoe's nose bridge so next

120
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:40,799
I want to do is go back into tones I've

121
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,810
got the picker and then I'm gonna take a

122
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,310
dark kind of brown shade and I'm gonna

123
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:46,170
pick it right from Zoe's contour over

124
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:48,930
here and I'm gonna use this color - now

125
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:50,159
sketch in a new nose bridge if that

126
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,720
makes sense so basically you guys know

127
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,280
what I like to contour my nose because I

128
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:56,189
definitely have a very very large

129
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,970
sister schnoz that I like to just snatch

130
00:03:56,189 --> 00:04:01,709
that was a lot whoa and the closer you

131
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:02,970
draw the two lines together this smaller

132
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:04,560
your nose it's going to look I'm gonna

133
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:06,180
go back and as always nose with this

134
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,939
dark brown color and I'm gonna sketch in

135
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,680
to nose contour lines and obviously this

136
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:12,540
is gonna look very very intense but

137
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,459
we're gonna blend them out so now that

138
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:16,049
they turn into poor so we do an anteater

139
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:17,699
here I'm gonna grab the eraser tool and

140
00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:19,250
I'm gonna lightly tap over those two

141
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:20,750
lines to soften everything

142
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,460
make it not look absolutely crazy and

143
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,990
then it once again a smooth tool to kind

144
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:25,130
of blend everything out so now that we

145
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:26,660
have the contours and the brightness

146
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:28,280
built in we definitely need to add some

147
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:30,020
highlights to really provide a contrast

148
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,030
and finish off this sister nose snot

149
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,830
what I want to do is grab the tones tool

150
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:35,450
once again as you can see this is a very

151
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:37,010
very similar theme throughout I don't

152
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:38,450
gonna go to palette right over here and

153
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:40,130
what I want to grab for Zoe's skin tone

154
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:42,020
is a shade right in between a yellow and

155
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:43,490
orange barely Goldy Sheen and then or

156
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:45,710
right up at the top I want to drag this

157
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:47,690
color picker to like an off-white type

158
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:49,340
of color then I'm gonna go right in and

159
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:51,140
top right on at the tip of the nose and

160
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:53,240
then kind of right down the bridge

161
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:58,820
focusing it mostly right in between the

162
00:04:53,240 --> 00:05:01,210
eyebrows all right guys are we ready for

163
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:05,900
the iconic before and after here we go

164
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:07,760
before and after ooh

165
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,780
literally so good it looks like she can

166
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,830
barely even breathe do you guys know

167
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:12,320
that it's always my goal when it comes

168
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:13,490
to editing my nose contour and as well

169
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,630
nose contour is one of those things that

170
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:16,100
is very much affected by lighting

171
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:17,450
sometimes it can look really really bomb

172
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,770
and the right lighting and sometimes if

173
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,480
you're in a very shadowed lighting it

174
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:22,100
can look literally at the worst I just

175
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,630
fixed up Zoe's nose nice and good it

176
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,100
made its sister snatch and I think she

177
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:26,810
will definitely love this and for all of

178
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,550
you guys out there if you're like me and

179
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:30,080
you're on a budget saving for a sister

180
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:32,419
house that is how you get a rhinoplasty

181
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,250
with facetune let's move on to the next

182
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:36,229
sister selfie so we obviously want to

183
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:38,150
work with her nose done hello a little

184
00:05:36,229 --> 00:05:39,770
reason girl so good we went to somebody

185
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:42,500
else who wants a different feature fixed

186
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:44,510
oh okay this baby is from a sister Emily

187
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,890
and she says I wear my makeup for an

188
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,330
hour when this photo was taken the

189
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:48,860
foundation was a little bit splotchy but

190
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:50,450
the vibrancy and the eye shadow isn't as

191
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,710
much as I want it also do anything to

192
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,720
make it look less wrong let me move

193
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:55,400
every selfie ever and she attached this

194
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,720
photo of herself oh my god hello girl

195
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,010
you look so beautiful your eyeshadow

196
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,330
looks amazing it looks like this is

197
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,830
actually a recreation of my coachella

198
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:02,300
look so definitely down to help a sister

199
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,770
out with this let's pull this into

200
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,610
facetune and see what we can do so in

201
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,990
this photo Emily said that her

202
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:07,550
foundation was a little bit splotchy but

203
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,390
in my opinion I think it looks really

204
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:09,710
really beautiful and bright

205
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:11,360
natural-looking I definitely want to

206
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:12,530
focus in on the eyes for this because

207
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,640
she said that she wishes the eyeshadow

208
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:15,110
was a little bit brighter and more

209
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,430
pigmented so I'm just gonna zoom right

210
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:17,840
in and when it comes to working with the

211
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:19,669
eyes the first thing that I always like

212
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,050
to do is do it the details tool I'll

213
00:06:19,669 --> 00:06:22,430
just tap a little triangle right down

214
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:24,260
here and then I'm gonna go in and

215
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:25,700
lightly tap over both of the eyes this

216
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:27,289
really brings up the saturation it makes

217
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,070
the block of the eyeliners definitely

218
00:06:27,289 --> 00:06:29,479
darker

219
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:30,970
makes the eyes pop a little bit and just

220
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:33,040
makes the eyes in general more

221
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:34,690
eye-catching if that makes sense

222
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:37,060
whatever I'm editing an eye shadow

223
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:38,170
especially colorful look on based it I

224
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:40,240
would like to do it in the same exact

225
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:42,100
order that I would apply and so for this

226
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,780
I'm assuming because I did this as well

227
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,760
that she started off with the colors in

228
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:47,650
the crease and so what I want to do is

229
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,910
grab the tones to it right down here and

230
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:51,100
I'm gonna start off with the right eye

231
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:52,960
or I guess her left eye hello and I'm

232
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,550
gonna grab a yellow tone first and I'm

233
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,630
gonna grab it right over here and I'm

234
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:58,480
just gonna start off by lightly tapping

235
00:06:55,630 --> 00:07:01,060
right in it dot regen then I'm gonna go

236
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,010
right in with orange topping right next

237
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:06,820
door

238
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:09,610
same thing with the red right next door

239
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:10,930
as well and then already it's looking so

240
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:12,970
much brighter but let's be real definite

241
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,170
looks a little bit fake right now so I'm

242
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:15,490
assuming she was going for a half cut

243
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:17,860
crease so what I'm gonna do is grab the

244
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:19,810
eraser tool and zoom way in and I'm

245
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:21,460
gonna lightly scrub over that crease

246
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:24,070
region to make sure that it still looks

247
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:26,590
nice and cut and then I'm gonna zoom out

248
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:27,940
and lightly tap over that entire eye to

249
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:30,190
keep the shadow that we've blended in it

250
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:31,600
but only make it like 50% there that

251
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:32,920
makes sense so it's just a little bit of

252
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,300
a boost but not to the point where it's

253
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:42,280
like fake and looks like a literal

254
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:43,570
rainbow on the eye so before I go into

255
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,740
the eraser tool just like I did in the

256
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:46,060
other eye if there's one a really

257
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,950
important thing that I want to note that

258
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:50,230
I can't I self personally doing all the

259
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:51,820
time and is a major major major major

260
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:53,919
face to know that it's gonna give away

261
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:55,300
the fact that it's edited real quick so

262
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,220
whatever you're taking a selfie at like

263
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,660
sister Emily or like me have you turned

264
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:00,250
your head to the side and you take a

265
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:02,080
selfie of course we get that good

266
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:03,640
jawline we got that good highlight but

267
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,610
whatever eye is facing away from the

268
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:08,290
camera is never going to be as bright as

269
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:10,060
the other eye because there is it light

270
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:12,040
heading in so you can help it out a

271
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:14,080
little bit but definitely be careful and

272
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:16,419
use it at your own risk so as you can

273
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,950
see before and after before and after

274
00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:19,419
definitely hoping out the pigmentation a

275
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:20,169
little bit without going insane like

276
00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:21,730
we've done the other eye

277
00:08:20,169 --> 00:08:22,690
I think I'm popular that so next in this

278
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:24,250
makeup tutorial if I'm remembering

279
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:26,080
correctly I cut the crease using

280
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:27,730
concealer and then glitter and I was

281
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,620
doing Emily did the same exact thing so

282
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:31,870
I want to make that glitter on her lid a

283
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:33,099
little bit brighter if you zoom in as

284
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:34,240
you can see it right here on the lid you

285
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:35,740
can see that she has some specks of

286
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,060
light which tells me she did put a

287
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,930
glitter there but I'm losing the

288
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:40,300
lighting she was and

289
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:42,070
didn't exactly pick it up so let's bring

290
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,910
it back a little bit I'm first gonna

291
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:46,790
grab the tones tool once again

292
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:48,620
when to palette and a light yellowy kind

293
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:50,750
of born shade and go all the way over to

294
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:53,060
the left and an off-white and then I'm

295
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:54,680
gonna sketch that right in between the

296
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,760
lashes a really important technique

297
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,230
winter face tuning is always the top

298
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,520
things and as opposed to scrubbing it on

299
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:00,140
especially when it comes to eye shadow

300
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,220
stuff because if you're wearing lashes

301
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,900
the last thing that you want to do is

302
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:04,160
cover up those losses with whatever fake

303
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,750
glow you're putting on because it's

304
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,340
gonna look really really fake and really

305
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,960
really bad I think I'm definitely happy

306
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:10,430
with that animate the lid much nicer

307
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,960
brighter definitely the glitter looks

308
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:13,100
like it's actually there now and while

309
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,900
we're still on that kind of a light

310
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:16,640
yellow white shade does like I did on

311
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,690
sister Zoe with the nose snatching I

312
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,130
want to add a little bit of that shade

313
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:20,360
or right here into the inner corner to

314
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:21,830
make her inner corner highlight a little

315
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,150
bit brighter and then same thing right

316
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:25,070
up here on the brow bone to really

317
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:26,600
intensify that highly and add a little

318
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:28,790
bit more contrast and attention to the

319
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,850
eye once again eraser tool just lightly

320
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:33,920
tapping over that and that looks so

321
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:35,270
snatched similar to rely shadow at the

322
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,130
last some of editing is what's going to

323
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,970
be at the blacks or the dark shades and

324
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:39,530
you always do this to make sure that

325
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:41,600
nothing gets really really money kind of

326
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:43,070
gob tones one last time and grab a black

327
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,720
and zoom all the way in and I'm just

328
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:46,220
gonna start lightly packing this right

329
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,080
into the crease to kind of add a little

330
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:49,910
bit more dimension onto the outer corner

331
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,800
and then as well right underneath that

332
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:52,820
eye region because as you can see

333
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,230
there's a little bit of lightness and

334
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:56,300
her crease that she probably did not

335
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:57,590
want there and then tapping in included

336
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,540
that looks a little bit crazy and

337
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:00,860
ridiculous so once again dropping the

338
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:02,390
eraser tool and just lightly tapping

339
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,980
over everything to keep a little bit of

340
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:05,510
that dimension but just erasing it so it

341
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,560
still looks a little bit natural and

342
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:07,820
last I finally not at least when it

343
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,310
comes to editing the eyes at this step

344
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:11,660
is totally optional I personally love to

345
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:13,370
do this in all my photos it's really

346
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:15,170
what gives me that doll like look that a

347
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:17,210
lot of you guys love it's going to be to

348
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:19,790
brighten the actual eye so in this photo

349
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:21,260
emily has beautiful bright blue eyes but

350
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:23,150
clearly she's wearing a pretty big

351
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:24,980
lashes and black eyeliner so they did

352
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:26,870
get a little bit lost inside what I want

353
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:28,520
to do is grab the tones to all once

354
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:30,590
again and I'm going to dip into a kind

355
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:32,060
of like an aqua shade then zoom into the

356
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:34,040
pupils and I'm just gonna kind of place

357
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:36,020
that color right in the bottom and a

358
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:38,300
little bit of a rounded u-shape there it

359
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:40,220
is girl so good hello she thought it

360
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,870
staring it's my soul loved ah and then

361
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:43,520
of course erasers will top over it so

362
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:44,720
it's not too intense and too scary

363
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,000
alright I think we're ready for before

364
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,200
and after numero dos let's go and take a

365
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,210
look at what we were able to do -

366
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:52,280
Emily's rainbow eyeshadow look we have

367
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:54,920
the before and the

368
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:56,930
- literally so cute as you can see we do

369
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,130
not actually edit any makeup on just

370
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:59,750
edited what was already there to make it

371
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:01,400
a little bit more intense more vibrant

372
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:03,800
more eye-catching and I think this looks

373
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:05,090
so beautiful and so stunning and this is

374
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,830
actually like the same exact I think

375
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:08,270
that I used to edit my Coachella rainbow

376
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,710
makeup look photo so if any of you guys

377
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:10,610
recreate the look try this out and try

378
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,020
any of these techniques with your

379
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:13,070
eyeshadow looks I guarantee it'll make

380
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,510
your makeup look so much more beautiful

381
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:16,220
and so much more pop in it for your

382
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:17,840
sister selfies alright guys so let's see

383
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:19,790
who our next victim is that we already

384
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:22,160
did nose contour and also the our region

385
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:24,350
so I think I next want to focus on skin

386
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,730
you're kidding hello Britney J said give

387
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,170

388
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:30,110
also this was a recreation of one of

389
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:32,840
your looks you guys are all so pretty

390
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:35,120
and talented what the huh oh here's this

391
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:37,040
Ginty okay Leah said can you fix my skin

392
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:41,720
please sister make it look snap so let's

393
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:43,280
see hello

394
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,020
it literally already is - okay I'm not

395
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,280
gonna help her but this does bring up a

396
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,780
really good point that I actually want

397
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,980
to mention when it comes to editing skin

398
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:51,200
and once again it this is saying that I

399
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:53,930
catch myself doing a lot what are the

400
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,400
biggest no-nose of face to ever is over

401
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:56,720
editing the skin there's this smooth

402
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:59,030
tool and there's a super smooth tool

403
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,020
moving can only go so far obviously it

404
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:01,339
always like to start out with the smooth

405
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:03,170
tool just lightly tap over everything to

406
00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:04,880
kind of even out the base I personally

407
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:05,990
love the look of a little bit of skin

408
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,130
texture even if there's a few

409
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:08,570
imperfections in there because I think

410
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:10,070
it makes the photos look a lot more raw

411
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:12,380
and a lot more real and if you're

412
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:13,640
editing a lot more believable okay let's

413
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:15,380
see who we can actually help out here

414
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:17,000
hello okay this is a selfie from a

415
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:18,230
sister Anarky and I love her I follow

416
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,910
her on Twitter hey girl

417
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:22,040
what's up and she sent me this beautiful

418
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:23,180
host makeup selfie with this beautiful

419
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,520
pink weight on it hey girl

420
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:27,140
love that and she actually gave us a no

421
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,400
comment so I wouldn't think this healthy

422
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,450
version focus on the skin because

423
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,980
there's a few things that I want to

424
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:32,210
change to make this photo just a little

425
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,830
bit better alright so we have this photo

426
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,480
up and ready to go and the first step is

427
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:37,430
always going to be the smooth tool she

428
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,870
literally has almost perfect skin but

429
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:40,250
she does have a few blemishes right here

430
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:41,810
on the cheek that we can definitely get

431
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:44,300
rid of super easily so I'm gonna grab it

432
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:45,890
the patch tool like duct go right over

433
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,570
the pimple area and then bring it to an

434
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,920
area right next door in the contour just

435
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:52,670
to get rid of it and click the checkmark

436
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:54,410
and bam gone wow so easy is so beautiful

437
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:56,060
gonna go right over this same exact

438
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:58,100
thing click the little check mark wow

439
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:59,120
blemishes never heard of them

440
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,350
for me personally when I'm editing

441
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,180
photos if I have a really bad pimple

442
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:04,100
that's always the absolute first thing

443
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,740
to go I'm very very insecure about my

444
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,180
acne and I know

445
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,890
a lot of you guys out there are as well

446
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:09,600
but if you're able to rock your acne and

447
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:10,740
feel beautiful and confident with it go

448
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,390
you major props

449
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:13,740
unfortunately for myself cannot say the

450
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:16,080
same but if any you guys wonder how to

451
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:17,459
edit it out patch tool that's how so now

452
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,200
we go back into our normal regular

453
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:20,339
routine of styling the sister smooth

454
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,930
tool just to kind of blend everything

455
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:23,490
together and just give you a nice and

456
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:25,050
even base as you can see here if I click

457
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:26,250
the before and after it still keeps a

458
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:28,140
lot of that skin texture and a lot of

459
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:29,550
the dimensions of her face but it does

460
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,720
blend out some of those harsher areas

461
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:32,339
and contours making everything look

462
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,870
really really beautiful and more smooth

463
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:35,910
so much of the eye shadow I now when I

464
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:37,920
grab the details tool and I want to just

465
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:40,320
detail over any features such as the

466
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,550
eyes the eyebrows and the lips because

467
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,810
of course we did a smooth out the skin

468
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:44,490
and I don't want to lose any of that

469
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:45,720
dimension and I was time for the tones

470
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,430
tool and this is literally like my

471
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,020
all-time secret to getting a perfect

472
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:50,190
skin and freeze to it can't believe I'm

473
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:52,050
about to give you guys this full-on

474
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:54,510
secret but turn welcome I love doing

475
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:55,760
charity work I'm gonna grab the tones

476
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:58,470
tool and I just want to even out

477
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,779
anarchies skin tone and then a recontour

478
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:02,490
it so it looks literally so incredibly

479
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:03,930
statue all about to be so shot gonna

480
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:06,209
grab the picker tool and I'm gonna grab

481
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:08,279
this kind of light ish yellow shade or

482
00:14:06,209 --> 00:14:09,870
right here underneath her eye and I'm

483
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:11,579
gonna use that and tones and I'm gonna

484
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:16,829
kind of brush that over this entire

485
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:18,360
region do not change the color I'm gonna

486
00:14:16,829 --> 00:14:19,800
grab that same exact shade of yellow and

487
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,980
I'm gonna pop that right in the center

488
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:24,540
of her forehead right over her upper lip

489
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,890
region as well if you're like me and

490
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,970
you're a man you probably have a 5

491
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:28,829
o'clock shadow and if you're like

492
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:30,660
anarchy and you have beautiful big lips

493
00:14:28,829 --> 00:14:32,279
usually your lip tends to flip up which

494
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,300
gives a natural shadow in this region so

495
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:34,620
sometimes it's really good to put a

496
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,910
highlighter there to kind of counteract

497
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,680
that so it doesn't look like a really

498
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:40,140
weird and gross by the clock shadow that

499
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,370
most of us probably do not want I'm also

500
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:43,680
gonna pop a little bit of this yellow

501
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:45,230
right here right kind of on the jaw line

502
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,250
region or right in between like this

503
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:48,750
contour area and then similar to every

504
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:50,399
other process so far I'm gonna grab the

505
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:52,500
eraser tool and I'm gonna lightly tap

506
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,760
over that entire region to keep the code

507
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,560
that I just added but make it a little

508
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,870
bit less intense so it's not like the

509
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:59,190
most and like literally bright yellow

510
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:00,540
okay so we just highlighted and our key

511
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:02,459
space by adding a lot of yellow all

512
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,630
around but she is a woman of color and

513
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:04,980
the last thing that I want to do is

514
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:07,350
lighten her skin tone or give her a

515
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:09,120
flash marry moment that is so not the

516
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:10,860
mood for today a so now I want to kinda

517
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,000
rock those highlights by a contouring a

518
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,589
little bit better grab the tones tool

519
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,820
once again and I'm gonna grab a shade

520
00:15:13,589 --> 00:15:16,890
kind of on the outer perimeter of her

521
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:18,420
face right up in here by her hair

522
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:20,010
and I want to use that brown shade with

523
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:21,420
the tones tool to kind of add in and

524
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:22,860
intensify a little bit of those contours

525
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:25,080
to really bring a lot more dimension

526
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:27,660
back so I'm gonna place that right in

527
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:29,490
the hollows of her cheekbones kind of

528
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:31,890
right along her nose bridge similar to

529
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:34,320
sister Zoe from before hand and also

530
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:37,290
right up in that hairline region to make

531
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,580
the forehead look nice and snatched when

532
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:39,900
you're editing - before you go ahead and

533
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:41,280
save or erase anything it's really

534
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,600
important to check the little blue

535
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:44,190
button down here and select your before

536
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,750
and afters to see where your color

537
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:47,070
actually is as you can see right here I

538
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,390
accidentally put a little bit of brown

539
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:50,250
it and our he's hair and I definitely

540
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:51,630
did not want that there so I'm gonna be

541
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,890
eraser tool and just go right over at

542
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:54,510
that region because if that looks a

543
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:57,540
crusted busted and I actually have some

544
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:59,400
brown up here as well this contour looks

545
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,660
absolutely beautiful once again like I

546
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,040
said I'm gonna take the eraser tool

547
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,630
though and kind of soften it a little

548
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:05,070
bit because let's be real it's looking a

549
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:06,750
little bit harsh and I don't want her to

550
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:12,690
look crusted just a little bit more

551
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:14,190
chiseled alright guys I think we are

552
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:16,500
ready for our before and after sister

553
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:20,670
Anarky ready here we go we have the

554
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:23,580
before and BAM the after oh my god

555
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:25,170
literally so it's not as you can see it

556
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:26,400
by using the tones - and the details -

557
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:27,930
and the smooth tool you're able to

558
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,730
really even out that skin tone and make

559
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:31,050
it look so much more smooth while still

560
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:32,670
keeping all of the different highlights

561
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:33,930
and contours and looking beautiful and

562
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:35,340
defined these are the techniques that I

563
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:36,870
use in all of my photos to get beautiful

564
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,950
skin so hopefully you guys were able to

565
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,630
follow that and it was a little bit

566
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:41,580
complicated but I think anarchy is going

567
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:43,020
to absolutely love this alright sisters

568
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:44,910
so those are three photos of you guys

569
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:46,530
all completely edited if we started off

570
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:48,390
with this is your nose contour eye

571
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:49,890
shadow and then also skin off through

572
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:51,300
and I feel like that had all of the

573
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:53,190
different points that really go into my

574
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:55,770
face tuning Rutina but this video would

575
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:57,630
only be fair if now I have to face soon

576
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:59,310
myself until you guys what am i before

577
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:00,900
actors I done this a few times before

578
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:02,790
but let's be real I definitely face tune

579
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,870
a lot so I thought it'd be fun to kind

580
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:05,190
of look through some of the photos that

581
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:06,570
I've been taking recently and show you

582
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,580
guys what it takes to go from regular

583
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:09,720
photo to Instagram ready let's go

584
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,140
through a camera roll and find a good

585
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,360

to go through and clean those up soon a

589
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,200
lot of them are a selfie he's okay I

590
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:20,700
have these always from a Shake Shack a

591
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,410
few days ago I took them while I was

592
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:25,980
eating fries I've been in fresh photo

593
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:27,450
shoot let's see other words you have to

594
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,209
pick up the one that I want first and

595
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:30,009
there's

596
00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:31,899
a lot of them oh my god the lighting and

597
00:17:30,009 --> 00:17:34,240
Shake Shack is literally the worst hello

599
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,299
you please sponsor me okay I just go

600
00:17:36,009 --> 00:17:39,100
through all these and the bad lighting

601
00:17:37,299 --> 00:17:41,139
and the bad outfit choice not exactly my

602
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:43,019
favorite not even gonna lie but I think

603
00:17:41,139 --> 00:17:45,249
that I finally decided on this photo to

604
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:46,450
possibly be grabbed don't even know

605
00:17:45,249 --> 00:17:47,919

606
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:49,269
nothing but I'm gonna pull this one

607
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,369
right in to face soon and I'm gonna show

610
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,299
be a lengthy process but you guys get to

611
00:17:54,369 --> 00:17:57,299

[Music]

618
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:59,710
literally 20 minutes later that was ugly

619
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:01,930
a long visioning process but this photo

620
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:03,220
had a lot of saving to do let's be real

621
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:04,660
and I probably will even go back into

622
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:06,820
this later on and I think I'm ready to

623
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:09,070
show you guys this iconic sister James

624
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:10,900
Charles Instagram ready before and after

625
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:14,640
ready we have of course the before that

626
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:17,740
you guys all saw and one two three BAM

627
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:19,120
the after hello there was definitely a

628
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,800
lot that I wanted to do if we look at

629
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,440
the before and afters as if idli on the

630
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,970
base yeah sister needed a little bit of

631
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,640
work there was this really weird and

632
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:29,290
very very dark line going down the

633
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,730
entire side of my face I have no idea

634
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:32,650
what that was I'm assuming it was a

635
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:34,870
shadow from either like a windowpane or

636
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:37,929
something lord knows that's not usually

637
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:39,100
there at least I hope not I did do a

638
00:19:37,929 --> 00:19:40,270
little bit of reshaping and you guys

639
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,890
know I'm very very insecure about the

640
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:43,480
size of my forehead so brought her down

641
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,559
just a little bit and then for the most

642
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,850
part I just evened out my skin tone

643
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,710
using the same techniques that we used

644
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:48,790
on sister anarchy slim down the nose

645
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:50,230
bridge is a little bit using the same

646
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:51,850
technique she used on sister Zoe and

647
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:53,830
then detailed the eyes like we did on

648
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:55,450
sister Emily that was super simple then

649
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:57,040
I finished it off using a not so simple

650
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:58,360
filter it does add a really really cool

651
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,950
effect and I think that that is it the

652
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,000
finished photo and I really like how

653
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,440
this turned out I was a little bit

654
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,270
spooked at first not gonna lie but I

655
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,830
think this might be Instagram ready

656
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,790
maybe

657
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:08,080
alright sisters that is only half for

658
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:10,300
this videos today and not even gonna lie

659
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,830
I just had so much fun for the past few

660
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:13,330

00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:14,980

669
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:27,910
kind of cheesy to say but honestly post

670
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:30,130
an unedited photo online these days is

671
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:31,150
very very very brave you guys know like

672
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:32,590
I was talking about earlier literally

673
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:33,460
everybody edits their photos at this

674
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:35,260
point and it's something that I really

675
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:36,670
really love to do hopefully learn some

676
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:38,260
helpful tips and techniques and you guys

677
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:39,850
get to see that I never really like to

678
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,960
edit on makeup but really change myself

679
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:42,429
much I just like to edit and enhance

680
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,960
what's already there to take your photo

681
00:20:42,429 --> 00:20:46,210
so I'm pretty good and really really

682
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:47,860
beautiful too like literally the best

683
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:50,559
ever have everybody shaking and having

684
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:51,400
wigs snatched left and right also side

685
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,660
note that I've been thinking about this

686
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,130
entire video like I just think

687
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:55,480
beforehand it is obviously okay to edit

688
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:56,470
to fix any insecurities that you may

689
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,290
have or just to make your photos look

690
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:59,180
really

691
00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:00,740
Bob but it is so important that you guys

692
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:02,060
love yourselves love your bodies and

693
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:03,080
love the person that you are and of

694
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,520
course if you want to change that that

695
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,750
it's a very very personal decision but

696
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,770
you should definitely not rely on face

697
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:08,180
tune to be someone that you were

698
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:09,350

00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:11,060
