13
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,180

14
00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:43,739
you keep on watching

15
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:45,480
let's go so many brushes so for rotation

16
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:47,460
today I'm using my makeup art all try HD

17
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,590
foundation set its way dark because this

18
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,500
clouds not planned and it not to me and

19
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:55,140
not willing but alright so you need your

20
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,360
foundation first yeah okay I don't want

21
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,980
to say about how the what we do like

22
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:01,050
this reason personally go around that I

23
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,870
do do you really yeah way too much work

24
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:07,020
cuz I actually like minesweeper or I

25
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:09,570
like your eyes they don't ya

26
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:11,549
overlap and then for glitter yes that

27
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:14,340
doesn't work for the other thing you can

28
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:17,969
do is you do your foundation first and

29
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:23,100
then you put your eyes on is not give a

30
00:01:17,969 --> 00:01:24,840
[ __ ] yeah that works as well so for

31
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,219
