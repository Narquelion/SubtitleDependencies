00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,330
hi sisters James Charles here and

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,470
welcome back to my youtube channel so I

3
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,850
just got out of a meeting in Santa

4
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:09,030
Monica which if you know la is probably

5
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:10,740
on the west side and I currently have to

6
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,360
go to a fitting and then a red carpet

7
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,950
tonight and then a dinner and then a

8
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,480
movie so today's going to be an

9
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,940
absolutely crazy night and the one

10
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,250
problem is that is currently for 1/2

11
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,710
p.m. and that means there is LA traffic

12
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:25,859
and if you live in LA you know that la

13
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:27,420
traffic is no joke and is like our long

14
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,560
ventures no matter where you go and I

15
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,640
currently have to go to Hollywood which

16
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,279
isn't gonna be in the car for at least

17
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,930
an hour which is not the best so I have

18
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:35,190
sister Anthony with me and I packed all

19
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,510
eye makeup goodies in here because I

20
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,250
knew this is gonna happen and I planned

21
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:40,410
accordingly like the good sister I am I

22
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,850
have all my makeup ready and I just

23
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,469
called an uber frost bear currently at a

24
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,870
gas station and I'm gonna be filming a

25
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:47,760
get ready in the end and uber video

26
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,780
today I'm a little spooked I don't know

27
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,789
how this is gonna go

28
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,770
hopefully the ride isn't bumpy hopefully

29
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:54,840
my face looks beats by the end of it but

30
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,430
this is gonna be a major time crunch so

31
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:04,439
if you guys wanna see to get ready in an

32
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:05,640

33
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:07,140

00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,860

keep it nice and clean not trying to

47
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,730
mess up this car I'm gonna start off

48
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,720
with my beauty blender foundation and

49
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:41,220
I'm not realizing that I didn't bring

50
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,170
them here either so I guess I only have

51
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:49,080
money here which is very musty in my

52
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:50,850
shade and light palette so I'm sorry

53
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,350
anybody who has motion sickness I've

54
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:53,670
recently been using a new combination of

55
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:56,910
foundation which I'm starting off in my

56
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:59,220
Giorgio Armani luminous silk and I like

57
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:01,140
to add like a few like one pump of my

58
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:03,420
ball in this way by Too Faced which you

59
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,850
guys know I stand by and then also a

60
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,170
tiny bit of the anasazi liquid glow and

61
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:09,570
I've been using the shade of pearl I

62
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,310
just like a really really dewy skin base

63
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:13,200
I don't know why I also know I'm doing

64
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:15,360
all these liquids cuz ya'll know but I

65
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:21,810
love my HD stick and a stuff Li new free

66
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:23,310
but okay so like I said I just had a

67
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,720
very very exciting meeting about

68
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:28,410
something that I've been working on for

69
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:31,290
a very long time to hear all about and I

70
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:37,830
promise you'll be hearing soon so keep

71
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:39,660
your ears and your eyes peeled for a

72
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:41,340
very very fun movie premiere that way

73
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,650
managers brother is actually working on

74
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,690
so I'm going to walk the red carpet and

75
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:47,370
looking lamp but y'all know me I were

76
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:49,650
the same damn alpha every time I walk

77
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,940
about carpet so I'm going to get silent

78
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:53,100
tonight which I'm super excited for

79
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,870
because I never really get to get styled

80
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,730
and how they believe like professional

81
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:57,200
outfit so that should be fun and we're

82
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,640
currently head

83
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,010
over there right now but like I said

84
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,870
Pelle traffic a little bit spooky

85
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:05,629
especially this time of the day and we

86
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:07,940
are how long to stay we are away about

87
00:03:05,629 --> 00:03:09,800
20 minutes okay sir about 20 months wait

88
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:11,150
for the stylist and then from there we

89
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,489
have to go to the carpet so I need to

90
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:14,720
get glam fast my base is all Ottoman of

91
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:16,489
course she's my heart shaped ape

92
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,160
consumer and this is in the shade

93
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:20,750
light/medium and I'm gonna put this

94
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:23,810
between my pants carefully and try not

95
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:26,450
to spill as anywhere and then of course

96
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:28,040
on here so far not as hard to do makeup

97
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:30,500
in a moving vehicle as I thought it

98
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,700
would be but then again we haven't

99
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:35,470
really gotten to anything serious I

100
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:37,489
anticipate the brows being challenges

101
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:39,800
this is funny I feel like we're filming

102
00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:41,239
a documentary eight oh my god speaking

103
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:46,880
of this week I actually went to Demi

104
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:48,200
Lovato's document April or snapchat to

105
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,970
literally follow me everything in this

106
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,410
body but if you guys want me you know

107
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:53,510
that I went and it was literally one of

108
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:56,450
the most fun nights of my entire life

109
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:58,400
I was actually [ __ ] personally invited

110
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:01,069
by WGME on Instagram as a girl you need

111
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,019
to go and I was like sister I'm there so

112
00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:05,600
it was just a magical experience I got

113
00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:07,430
to meet her she was just so nice

114
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,870
I generally look up to Demi it's so much

115
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:10,849
because she's been through so much in

116
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:12,440
this cut out so strong and also she just

117
00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:16,040
has literally like the best voice in all

118
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:17,030
three so just an amazing experience you

119
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,880

124
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:33,260

Anthony this is just like speaking to me

163
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:59,580
maybe you should hang up there's a

164
00:06:49,290 --> 00:07:00,990
voicemail I mean honestly for what we're

165
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:05,280
working with back there it looks good

166
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:06,780
Anthony you're so good I literally never

167
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,640
walk carpets or go to events and I'm

168
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:13,830
actually confident happy with what I'm

169
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:15,240
wearing I love this okay so we just got

170
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:21,270
the often and now the event currently

171
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:22,740
service and I think that's away so we're

172
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:25,770
going to get back in the zubur and we're

173
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:27,439
gonna clap because this is not red

174
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:30,259
carpet ready

175
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:31,580
and I'm doing my eyebrows now this is

176
00:07:30,259 --> 00:07:33,499
not the most easy thing to do it and

177
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,909
it's black okay it's so weird seeing you

178
00:07:33,499 --> 00:07:37,039
from the side but not your highlight

179
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:40,039
I mean it's usually facetune on anybody

180
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,029
sound okay the fact that there's traffic

181
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:43,740
right now is actually playing at my

182
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:45,789

manage to get our entire face done over

219
00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:29,069
the course of the last few hours and a

220
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:31,290
moving vehicle this is not easy but we

accomplished this and I'm proud of us

222
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:34,920

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,490

00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,490
