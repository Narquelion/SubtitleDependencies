00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,780
hi sisters James Charles here and

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:04,920
welcome back to my youtube channel I was

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,970
looking at my calendar a few days ago

4
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,620
because I'm doing some traveling

5
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:09,090
very very soon which I'm very excited

6
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,590
about and I noticed that we were at the

7
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,240
end of September which means October is

8
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,290
coming up sister's goofy month a

9
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,420
favorite time of the entire year

10
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,430
literally cannot wait but that also

11
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,410
means that my anniversary of the first

12
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:21,330
time that I ever put on makeup is coming

13
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,070
up in a few days and oh my god I am

14
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,260
literally so excited it is about to be

15
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,060
our three year sister bursary I

16
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,039
literally cannot believe this is do my

17
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,800
job for three years now I pinch myself

18
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,510
every single day and it's literally so

19
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,649
cool and I thought for our three year

20
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,750
anniversary we should do something very

21
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:38,520
very fun and good and fresh and special

22
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,840
I'm working on one other video right now

23
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,730
that you guys will see in a few short

24
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,739
weeks but it required me to go way back

25
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,570
in time and open up the history books on

26
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:48,480
both my Instagram and my youtube channel

27
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:49,980
and through doing this I came across my

28
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,829
first ever youtube video which I

29
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:54,570
literally have erased from my mind if

30
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:58,289
you've been a longtime subscriber you

31
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:59,550
know that I have changed drastically so

32
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:01,350
for today's video I want to react to

33
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:03,090
this video and see what has changed I

34
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,530
know I've gotten way more comfortable on

35
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,600
camera my talking speed is probably

36
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,549
multiplied by literally a million at

37
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,170
this point and I also would love to try

38
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:11,549
to recreate the look and kind of

39
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,350
modernize and see how I would do the

40
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:14,970
same exact look in today's makeup skills

41
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:17,070
I am praying that my makeup has gotten

42
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:19,350
way way way better oh yeah

43
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:21,030
James 2016 Sharpie eyebrows there's no

44
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:23,520
way I could even lose at this foolproof

45
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:25,740
plan without further ado let's pull up

46
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:32,400
the first ever video and take a trip

47
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:35,880
down memory lane okay this video is

48
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,460
titled blue brown serpent before I even

49
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,670
finish that sentence literally why

50
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:42,720

and as posted two years ago

57

62
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:17,410
beautiful good and fresh hair that I

63
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:20,140
loved I used to have a man dime and it

64
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:21,910
was bad disgusting and horrible and

65
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,990
cutting that off was probably one of the

66
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,680
best decisions I've ever made in my

67
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:27,400
entire life

68
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:30,480
so in this video I am rocking gray man

69
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,480
bun which was a bad choice

70
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,410
sixteen-year-old makeup artist from New

71
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:38,380
York and I run the Instagram page to

00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:39,340
change her on Beauty lately sisters

73
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:42,160

74
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:45,070
this is so weird oh my god they're

75
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:47,290
talking so slow hi guys my name is James

76
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:49,660
I'm a 16 year old makeup artist from New

77
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:51,100
York and I run the Instagram page J

78
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:52,630
Charles Beauty I don't even think I

79
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:55,110
could talk about that now if I tried for

80
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,110
an entire video

81
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:59,069
[Music]

82
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,300
[Music]

83
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:14,950
you know everything about this paused

84
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:18,400
who the man but being tied up and

85
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:20,260
besides not being shaved looks gross the

86
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,720
eyebrows are taking up half of my

87
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:24,400
already very large forehead I would love

88
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,650
to know where I got trio chrome from

89
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,480
because the only color that I'm seeing

90
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:30,070
here is green but then again that could

91
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,320
be the fact that I was literally using

92
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:35,680
one light to shoot this video that cost

93
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:38,530
me $50 from Amazon my nose because of

94
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,410
the contour looks like it's about a good

95
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:45,250
inch thick so we love that and my top

96
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:50,590
lip is not there oh my god I forgot I

97
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:52,570
look filler oh my god this is why make

98
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:53,799
sure to keep on watching hi guys I'm

99
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:55,930
gonna be starting off today using my

100
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:57,489
benefit Porefessional primer I've been

101
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:58,959
million little bumps and pores all over

102
00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:00,400
my face so doing this would really help

103
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,980
me smooth everything out and get an even

104
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,660
foundation application next I'm going

105
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,740
into my la girl pro color corrector

106
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:08,080
concealer

107
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:11,350
she's just a color correcting shadow and

108
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,580
my aya literally cannot even tell you

109
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:14,350
the last time I color corrected my face

110
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,610
I think there were so many makeup trends

111
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:17,320
one of them being color correcting that

112
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:19,480
we're like so big at one point that now

113
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,650
literally nobody talked throughout if

114
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,210
you don't have this problem obviously

115
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:24,610
don't color products because this is not

116
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:26,470
pumpkin glam but if you're like me and

117
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:29,650
you get negative 15 hours to sleep this

118
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:31,390
might be for you I also get a solid 18 a

119
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:32,980
green color corrector also from Le girl

120
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:35,440
and then blended it out with my Beauty

121
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:38,290
Blender or its use the full coverage

122
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,540
foundation HD Ultra foundation in the

123
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:42,310
shade Y 255 and just putting a bunch of

124
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,900
little dots all over my face obviously

125
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:45,100
we're gonna blend these out later on but

126
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:49,600
it just helps create a really even

127
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:51,310
application that is yellow that is

128
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,080
literally yellow nothing has changed I

129
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:55,480
still can't match my foundation but good

130
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,950
lord we want a smooth transition and the

131
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:05,200
last thing we need is Moses parting the

132
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:06,070
foundation see on your face oh my god I

133
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,950
literally thought I was

134
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:10,600
YouTube's next comedian what is going on

135
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:14,410
I'm using my la girl Pro concealer in

136
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:16,180
the shade porcelain woah my face in the

137
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:18,160
middle of my forehead in the middle of

138
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:20,230
my chin on my moustache area and just

139
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,520
one line down the center of my nose this

140
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:23,110
will just make all the high points of my

141
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,750
face to stand out and then once again a

142
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:29,160
blending out with my Beauty Blender now

143
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:29,160
I'm setting my entire face using Cody

144
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:37,780
Cody or some powder let me tell you

145
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:39,760
great powder if you need to literally

146
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:42,010
lock in your makeup for the next eight

147
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:45,520
years this is what created flash like

148
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:46,540
Mary that's all I need to say on that I

149
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:57,040
don't think I need to elaborate any

150
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:59,050
further reduce crease edge that's before

151
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,880
I had a coupon code Oh gonna put it in

152
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:02,260
there now use go James for 10% off oh my

153
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,980
god I didn't even have code James then

154
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:07,240
this is so crazy here is control of this

155
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,920
color usually comes in the contour

156
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,330
palette but I actually deep hot in it

157
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,650
and just put it in my Z palette with all

158
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:13,540
my other contour and highlight shades

159
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:14,860
once again I'm just putting everyone's e

160
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,270
palettes were a thing and everybody used

161
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,860
to have like their little custom shadows

162
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:19,180
and their pal that they bring everywhere

163
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:21,219
does anybody even still do that Oh

164
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:30,490
nobody uses deepal because they had

165
00:06:21,219 --> 00:06:33,370
their scandal moving on oops still hated

166
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:35,289
the fun still hated the Fife at that and

167
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:37,360
today nothing has changed whoo at least

168
00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:38,830
we found one similarity next to further

169
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,629
defined my contour I'm using the same

170
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:42,699
brushes before and make up a cocoa bear

171
00:06:40,629 --> 00:06:44,020
it isn't eyeshadow but I never use blush

172
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:49,900
and I look so this really helps I just

173
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:51,069
warm everything up if you've been in the

174
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,479
make up community for a very long time

175
00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:54,490
you were probably very familiar with

176
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:57,009
makeup geek shadows because everybody

177
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:58,150
had pretty much their entire line makeup

178
00:06:57,009 --> 00:06:59,289
geek shadows are some of the first ones

179
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:01,750
that I ever ordered what I started doing

180
00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:03,219
makeup the shadow that I just used Coco

181
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:05,800
bear was one of my all-time favorites

182
00:07:03,219 --> 00:07:08,710
for brown smokey eyes and I just used it

183
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,330
to contour my face I know you can't

184
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:12,009
really tell because the lighting is the

185
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:21,250
worst I'm already looking yellow because

186
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:22,509
the foundation my contour is orange of

187
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,159
course the angles are gonna turn out

188
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:27,159
that that when your brows look that ugly

189
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:29,289
oh my god I cannot believe that these

190
00:07:27,159 --> 00:07:30,580
eyebrows literally were once mine they

191
00:07:29,289 --> 00:07:32,020
still are not perfect now like they

192
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:33,550
could I'm sure be a whole lot better

193
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:35,919
with the amount of hate comments that I

194
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:38,560
got on my eyebrows on a daily basis

195
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,969
which was an alarming amount for any

196
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,129
sixteen-year-old kid to be dealing with

197
00:07:39,969 --> 00:07:43,779
I don't know how it took me that long to

198
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:45,699
fix them the first day of convention I

199
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:47,259
ever went to I waited in line for over

200
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:49,599
an hour to the meet and greet for

201
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:51,250
anasazi Beverly Hills and she had been

202
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,900
following me and she was like oh my god

203
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:55,089
James I recognize you and I was

204
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:56,199
literally fangirling so excited and she

205
00:07:55,089 --> 00:07:58,210
literally looked me right in the eyes

206
00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:01,569
and said you need your eyebrows they're

207
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:03,520
horrible like I swear to god I wish I

208
00:08:01,569 --> 00:08:04,990
was kidding and in that moment I had

209
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,330
such a big ego at this time I was like

210
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:08,740
oh please and she literally sat there I

211
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:10,270
was like no you really need to tweeze

212
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,439
off like the entire bottom portion and

213
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:13,469
like lift them up and I was like oh

214
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:15,699
please lady they look fine

215
00:08:13,469 --> 00:08:16,689
I've actually if I had listened sooner

216
00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:17,409
we wouldn't have you know how to deal

217
00:08:16,689 --> 00:08:18,639
with this issue

218
00:08:17,409 --> 00:08:21,069
although the hate sucked at the time

219
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,900
thank you honestly truly for the bottom

220
00:08:21,069 --> 00:08:25,089
of my heart to everyone who ever left a

221
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,340
hate comment on my eyebrows I needed

222
00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:28,300
this like

223
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:31,389
that's what they look like right there

224
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:36,340
this entire look I use my morphe 35o

225
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:38,200
palette I'm using my Murphy I'm four for

226
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:40,419
one and once again just a medium brown

227
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,740
tone from the 35k palette I'm putting

228
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,789
that in the inner and outer views of the

229
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:44,440
eyes and then just taking whatever

230
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:46,510
excess product is left and coming in

231
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:49,570
windshield wipers just to find that

232
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:51,670
crease okay honestly not gonna like my

233
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:53,590
tutorial skills back then although it

234
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:55,390
may not have looked pretty we're pretty

235
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:56,890
decent like I will say no I definitely

236
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:58,330
get a lot of comments complaining that I

237
00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:00,520
skipped through everything which I

238
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:01,360
definitely do but like how did you good

239
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,560
to have a good explaining everything

240
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,640
here making sure it's like eventually

241
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,800
all the right angles

242
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,150
good job sixteen year old me in the

243
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,940
waterline I'm just going in with the

244
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:11,620
Italia deluxe I pencil in turquoise I

245
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,760
got this at the morphe store if you

246
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:14,260
don't have this eye pencil you can

247
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,820
easily just do black it's really up to

248
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:17,770
you but I wanted another pop of color on

249
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:19,480
the bottom I actually lost the clip but

250
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:21,730
I did use the NYX jumbo eye pencil in

251
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,620
black bean just so mimic the halo effect

252
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:25,210
that we have going on on the upper lid

253
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,710
and then once I did that I'm just going

254
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:27,970
back under the lower lash line couple

255
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:29,920
end everything out and connect it back

256
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:34,260
up to the top that was the longest

257
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,260
sentence I've ever heard my entire life

258
00:09:54,150 --> 00:10:02,860
oh my god

259
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:04,330
queen of run-on sentences the speech

260
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:06,850
patterns really have not changed and

261
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:08,800
sinus I'm just going to burn mascara

262
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:10,450
benefit roller lash it's so good and

263
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,010
makes my lashes look so on and not

264
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:14,290
clumpy so I would definitely recommend I

265
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:16,780
stole my cameras today I use the

266
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:18,430
Blackmagic lashes in siren I include my

267
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,780
eye shot what I try to do on camera so

268
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:21,430
definitely not going to do that again

269
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:22,720
anyway lesson learned

270
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:23,890
that is true I talked about this a few

271
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,550
times before but when I first started

272
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:26,950
doing makeup

273
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:28,390
I could not glue on eyelashes to save my

274
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:29,830
life probably because my eyebrows were

275
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:31,750
taking up half of my eye so I literally

276
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:33,220
could get no room in there and every

277
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:36,360
time that I tried I glued my eye shot

278
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:36,360
wish I was kidding

279
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:39,610
not so highly I'm just approaching my

280
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:41,320
brush again

281
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:43,030
sex+ to make it super to find and then

282
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:46,150
mixing these two colors for my Anasazi

283
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:47,380
aglow camp now we pack that highly on

284
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:49,120
like there's no tomorrow

285
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,590
remember the goal is that your toilet

286
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,620
can be seen from space and that you

287
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:54,220
blind everybody walking by okay we get a

288
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,560
sweetie

289
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:58,240
I always highlight my cheekbones the tip

290
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,530
of my nose and my cupids though just

291
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,560
because I think it looks cute

292
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:04,840
I am scared at the size of a brush I

293
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,730
just use to highlight my nose oh my god

294
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:08,230
this is why my nose looks like it is an

295
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:10,510
inch wide for my lips today I'm using

296
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:11,980
Oprah Brooklyn you guys always ask what

297
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:14,260
liquid lipsticks I like best and they're

298
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:15,850
definitely Oprah the formulation is so

299
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:17,830
good and they don't dry crusty and girls

300
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:19,450
like so many other brands do true I

301
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:20,770
still stand by this and I love the

302
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:23,110
overlook a lipstick they're by far my

303
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:24,580
favorite formula of all time also keep

304
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,970
the coupon code must have been over

305
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,740
first

306
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:28,900
this one was code J Charles but now it's

307
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:33,520
Co James it gets you 30% still to this

308
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:34,870
day my poor top left where was I even

309
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:37,480
putting the left stack at this point

310
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:39,100
like as an option last step I went ahead

311
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,660
and I added Houdini all over my lips

312
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:42,280
just for a cool Jerome effect

313
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:44,470
oh and that guy's is the finished look

314
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:46,790
if you enjoyed this tutorial and I will

315
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:53,190
see you soon with a new video

316
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:53,190
[Music]

317
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,670
well that was seven minutes of my life

318
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:01,770
that I will never get back looking back

319
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:04,350
at these videos for me is literally so

320
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:06,300
crazy I cannot believe it's already been

321
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:07,620
almost three years since I started doing

322
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:10,170
this like it feels like it was yesterday

323
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:11,880
but at the same time this person feels

324
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:14,610
foreign like who literally who is she

325
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:17,130
like the gray hair the man Vaughn the

326
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:20,700
big nose contour the non-existent topped

327
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:22,320
lamp the eyebrows like wow I'm really

328
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:24,089
thankful for both the positivity and

329
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,830
also the negativity on YouTube over the

330
00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:27,270
past few years because it's made me a

331
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:29,220
way more confident person a way more

332
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:31,350
comfortable person a way happier person

333
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,830
and also I won't say this with

334
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:34,110
confidence

335
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:36,300
oh hey better-looking person as well

336
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:37,770
thank God for this cologne personality

337
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:40,470
aside though the makeup in this video

338
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:42,899
I'm horrified I actually don't think

339
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:44,820
there was a single product or technique

340
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:46,440
honestly that I still use my everyday

341
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:48,990
makeup routine now that we've gotten

342
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,339
watching this out of the way thank God I

343
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:52,020
have all my favorite makeup products

344
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:53,700
here that I now use on an everyday at

345
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,810
daily basis and I want to try to

346
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,490
recreate this same exact look that

347
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:58,290
actually make it look really really bomb

348
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:59,970
really really beautiful and hopefully

349
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:02,300
actually show up and look nice and a

350
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:04,380
good studio setup so let's get clean

351
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:05,880
alright so starting off my routine today

352
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:07,110
I am NOT going to be color correcting I

353
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,839
have probably not color corrected it

354
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:11,040
honestly probably since that video so

355
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,570
for a foundation today I'm gonna go to

356
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,709
the Born This Way Foundation from Too

357
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:15,540
Faced you guys know this is my all time

358
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:16,680
a holy girl favourite in the original

359
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,690
video I was using the Make Up For Ever

360
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,950
Ultra HD liquid foundation which I

361
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:21,959
actually think is kind of funny because

362
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:23,700
if you know me and even around for a

363
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:25,080
very very long time you know that before

364
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,850
born this way I was actually using the

365
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,500
makeup forever stick foundation and that

366
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:30,420
was kind of like my Holy Grail that I

367
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,579
used forever so I don't even know why I

368
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:34,380
was using the liquid version in that

369
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:36,630
video because I generally cannot ever

370
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:38,130
remember liking that but guess I did so

371
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:39,900
end up on the sin I was gonna be using

372
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:41,339
the morphe Cod or highlighting sponge I

373
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,600
absolutely love this one if you want to

374
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:44,459
get this these Co J's for 10% off

375
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,029
putting it in now since I apparently

376
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:46,800
couldn't

377
00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:48,810
three years ago cuz had a good shade

378
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,860
match I still can't tell what are you

379
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:51,360
three years later I still don't know how

380
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,829
to match my foundation once AI

381
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,570
foundation all over my actual face I'm

382
00:13:52,829 --> 00:13:56,550
gonna grab just a big fluffy foundation

383
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:57,900
brush and dip into the same color and

384
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:59,780
this one this all down my neck

385
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:01,520
apparently I did not know how to

386
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,660
two years ago despite the fact that I

387
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,880
literally made a joke about Moses

388
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:06,530
parting the foundation see still

389
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,000
couldn't match it so I'm gonna make sure

390
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:10,310
that no matter what color my face is

391
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,750
today my neck is the same shade for good

392
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,710
suitors today and no surprises here I'm

393
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,180
just going to get my shape tape

394
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:15,740
concealer this one's gonna be in the

395
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:17,480
shade affair and I also have the shade

396
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:18,920
light natural to mix together as well

397
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,720
because this one is a little bit light

398
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:22,520
definitely do not want to be rushed back

399
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,810
Mary that is for sure I think in the

400
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,610
original video I was using the LA girl

401
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:27,650
Pro concealer I actually still like that

402
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:29,360
concealer a lot but shaving peepers

403
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:30,440
definitely a lot more full coverage the

404
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,420
one thing that I probably changed the

405
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:34,340
most and like my makeup process aside

406
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,930
for my eyebrows of course it's probably

407
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:38,690
my base routine which I'm really really

408
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:40,250
thankful for I used to use a super super

409
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:42,080
full coverage foundation and super full

410
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,520
coverage concealer and then pack it on

411
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,870
with Cody or some powder which looked

412
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,010
really nice of course for like Instagram

413
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:47,480
pictures which is literally the only

414
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,530
thing that I was doing but once I

415
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,000
actually started wearing makeup out

416
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:51,200
though and like actually being in the

417
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,030
real world and taking selfies and

418
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,830
looking in mirrors I quickly realized

419
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:57,260
how disgusting it looked because it was

420
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:58,640
so incredibly cakey and the one change

421
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:00,140
that I really made now is I definitely

422
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,820
prefer a really really light coverage

423
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:03,470
foundation but just a more full coverage

424
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:05,089
concealer so I can really focus the

425
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:06,440
coverage in the areas that I need it and

426
00:15:05,089 --> 00:15:07,610
actually like my normal skin shine

427
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,230
through I've worked really really hard

428
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:11,030
to clear out my skin and have a good

429
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:12,440
skin and definite like to show it off

430
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:14,540
and I think it's just a lot better a lot

431
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:16,700
more natural as well so definitely like

432
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:18,050
my base routine now a million times more

433
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,520
all right so everything is blended in

434
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:21,890
but I'm looking a little bit light

435
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,060
hi mr. spooked first or I want to set my

436
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:25,010
face in place and add some dimension

437
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:26,210
back as quickly as possible so first

438
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:27,589
today I'm gonna go to the Too Faced

439
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:29,030
peach perfect setting powder

440
00:15:27,589 --> 00:15:30,890
I'll let the Cody air some powder it's

441
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:32,360
actually not ridiculously drying it's

442
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:34,130
definitely more of like a light coverage

443
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,360
powder I actually really liked the fact

444
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:37,250
that this kind of wears down a little

445
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,530
bit throughout the day call me crazy but

446
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:41,360
my favorite time of like makeup is

447
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:42,560
probably two to three hours after wear

448
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,970
but it's still looking really really

449
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,950
beautiful but by that time some of your

450
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:46,880
like natural oils have kind of seeped

451
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:48,170
through you know that sounds really

452
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,520
gross I just like it to look a little

453
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:51,050
bit more worn and I feel like it looks

454
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,520
much more natural and it kind of gets

455
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,060
rid of that like vanilla cake mix type

456
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,290
of look

457
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,790
so this powder is definitely my all-time

458
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:56,750
favorite to achieve that look before I

459
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,980
actually move on to the next time I'm

460
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,540
gonna grab the morphe preppin set

461
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:01,310
setting spray I really really love this

462
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,630
because it has such a fine mist so I

463
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:03,830
always use this in-between of the stuff

464
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:05,450
so a makeup routine whenever I apply a

465
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,860
lot of powder just kind of lock

466
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:08,570
everything more in place add a little

467
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:11,230
bit of hydration back and that really

468
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:13,240
prevents the cakiness that the other

469
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:14,650
14:1 of different so next I'm going to

470
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,380
contour my face and guess what I'm not

471
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:18,970
gonna use an orange eyeshadow today I

472
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,840
have with me my Anasazi Beverly Hills

473
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:21,220
contour kit

474
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,020
I do have an orange in here but this I

475
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:25,060
use for blush so I'm just gonna got my

476
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:27,250
morphe emma 405 brush end up into this

477
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:29,020
cool tone right here on the bottom

478
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:30,820
corner i don't gonna use this to it just

479
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:32,080
chisel out my features i'm gonna go in

480
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:34,300
with a little bit of a light hand with

481
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,500
this as well i know by sound me recalled

482
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:38,380
the contour in the video i ended up

483
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:40,480
looking like okay but i remember taking

484
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:42,040
so many photos a long time ago where my

485
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,650
contour literally looked like a is

486
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:46,180
strike down my cheekbones it was so ugly

487
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:48,130
probably because i was using a dark

488
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:49,630
burnt orange eyeshadow for that but i

489
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:51,010
just wanna use a light hand and really

490
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:52,540
use this contour to chisel out my

491
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,520
natural features and not literally

492
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:55,780
create new ones because that's not the

493
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:58,060
point and it really does not look good

494
00:16:55,780 --> 00:17:02,500
ever definitely still gonna better - the

495
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:04,450
5head though definitely a contour out my

496
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:06,220
jaw line as well the one thing that i

497
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:07,480
noticed in that video oh my god by java

498
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:09,250
like definitely looked better two years

499
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,750
ago that it did now how did that even

500
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,380
happen that is literally so unfair I'm

501
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,330
calling the police

502
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:15,280
I'm not gonna grab the m-52 7 which is a

503
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:17,530
bigger fluffy brush and dip into this

504
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,270
kind of more a warm tone caramel shade

505
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:20,560
right next door and I'm gonna use this

506
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:22,330
it's kind of like a bronze or show you

507
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:26,980
just one together my natural skin tone

508
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:28,900
and my contour eventually nose color I'm

509
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:30,160
gonna grab my JD weighty 182 brush and

510
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,720
dip into that middle shade in the

511
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,980
contour palette once again if you've

512
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,510
been around for a long time you would

513
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,890
know that my nose contour has really had

514
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:38,260
a quite the dirty

515
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:40,570
clearly with this video I don't know how

516
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:43,240
to do it period so that was great and

517
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:45,370
scary then I got really really good at

518
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,690
it and now actually recently I haven't

519
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:47,770
even been compromised nose as much and

520
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,960
I've really learned to embrace it a

521
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:52,240
little bit more kind of fun I love that

522
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,680
journey regardless I'm so good at

523
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,270
contour today and I'm gonna make it not

524
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,920
look an inch long because that looked

525
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:58,390
about it so let's do that

526
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,070
I'm gonna make sure to place those two

527
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:01,150
contour lines pretty close together and

528
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:02,560
blend them out and when it comes to

529
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:03,760
highlighting them later I'm not going to

530
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:06,340
use a big Brush so hopefully that'll

531
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,660
help the illusion actually exists next

532
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,980
of course you guys know comes a blush

533
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:10,750
and first I'm going to be using the Mac

534
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:12,190
blush and the shaded peaches funny

535
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,810
enough in this video and actually for a

536
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:15,190
majority of my makeup career I do not

537
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:17,560
use a blush because I said that I didn't

538
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:19,570
like it for the longest time I really

539
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:21,020
felt as though like my cheekbones were

540
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:22,340
for some reason too high and

541
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:23,090
couldn't fit blush on there I really

542
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:25,760
don't know where this thought process

543
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:27,770
came from it was truly so so so stupid

544
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,179
but in my head at what I first started

545
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:31,040
doing makeup the only blush clothes that

546
00:18:29,179 --> 00:18:32,179
existed was bright pink which I hated

547
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,400
so finding peaches for me was like a

548
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:36,260
full-on like Holy Grail revival moment

549
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,280
and now I love blush once again before I

550
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:39,290
move on to the next time I'm just gonna

551
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,700
do a light spread of the morphe prepping

552
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:41,960
settings right before we move on to the

553
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,580
next time I am still going to bake my

554
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:45,410
face but I'm just gonna bake it lightly

555
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:47,450
as opposed to using a powder puff and

556
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:48,890
iris pilot like before I'm just gonna

557
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:50,900
grab my same Beauty Blender and dip into

558
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:52,640
at the peach setting powder and just

559
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:54,440
place a slightly underneath any areas

560
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,210
that I have contour just to bring some

561
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,530
of the highlights back by using a Beauty

562
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:59,690
Blender I'm really melting the product

563
00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:01,100
into the skin which is actually so much

564
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:02,990
better when it comes to creasing and

565
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,370
bringing highlights back as opposed to a

566
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:05,510
powder puff which Lauder just makes the

567
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:08,270
powder sit right on top

568
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:09,290
well that bakes in place on my face love

569
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,710
all those rhymes that just happen right

570
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:11,480
there

571
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:13,370
next I'm gonna move on to my brows now

572
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,080
and you guys know just like the original

573
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:16,580
video I still to this day usually skip

574
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:18,440
the brow process and do them off camera

575
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:19,520
because I don't like the angles of it

576
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,929
but you know what

577
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,370
in honor of today's video I thought I'd

578
00:19:20,929 --> 00:19:25,220
be so much fun to celebrate my borough

579
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:26,630
transformation god bless and do a little

580
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,770
bit of a brow routine for you guys

581
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:30,320
because I have not done one in a very

582
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:31,280
very long time so why not

583
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,809
to start off eyebrows today I'm gonna

584
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,390
use my Anasazi a brow is in the shade

585
00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:38,090
and medium brown I really like using a

586
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:39,410
brow pencil mainly because a dip brow is

587
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:41,330
what got me into the whole and James

588
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:42,830
Charles brick sharpie brow from before

589
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:43,970
but that's my fault for using it way too

590
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:45,320
heavy-handed but that's why I really

591
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:46,640
like a pencil because you can either use

592
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,900
it really really lightly to create those

593
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,370
little hair light strokes in the front

594
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:51,020
of the brow or you can actually really

595
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:52,910
press down and layer on and give it a

596
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:54,980
much more defined look you really get

597
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:56,600
the best of both worlds so I'm gonna go

598
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:58,460
right in and I'm gonna first it up by

599
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:00,410
using a spoolie and just to brush the

600
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:03,110
hairs upwards to see where my actual

601
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:04,640
brow is and then I'd like to go in and

602
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:06,770
start with the tail first

603
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,420
I'm honestly really not sure why

604
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:10,610
probably because my original brow tail

605
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:11,929
literally used to end like here and I'm

606
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,920
like triggered over it so I always had

607
00:20:11,929 --> 00:20:14,780
to make sure that it's in the right

608
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,280
place at first before I anything else

609
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,080
gets put on there but I just like to

610
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,820
draw that little point then follow it up

611
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,220
to the top that I always like to define

612
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:24,500
the lower arch and bring it in I'm

613
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:26,660
holding the pencil so lightly when I do

614
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:29,000
this as well literally applying like no

615
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:30,140
pressure at all once I get to the front

616
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,669
of the brow I'm just going to flick the

617
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,140
pencil upward to kind of create the

618
00:20:31,669 --> 00:20:33,580
illusion

619
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,990
hair strokes I always like to put the

620
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:36,460
hair strokes in place at first and it's

621
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:37,450
okay if it looks a little bit messy of

622
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:39,220
course I had to go to the concealer

623
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:40,420
after and clean everything once the

624
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:42,100
bottom of the brow is all taken care of

625
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:43,750
and is truly all smooth sailing from

626
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:45,340
here I really just like to get that over

627
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,870
with first because once again it can

628
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:48,550
really make her break the brow and I

629
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:50,650
definitely did not want to go back to it

630
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:51,820
straight bra from before so then once

631
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:53,290
that's all in place I literally just

632
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:55,180
take the pencil and I kind of follow

633
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:57,250
from this area right here that is really

634
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:59,260
dense and I literally just start to draw

635
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:01,450
and it's super super light hair strokes

636
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:02,770
and I'm filling in as I go as well and

637
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:10,120
then all I do literally once I get right

638
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:11,290
here it's just cool like that's so that

639
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,580
is the brow all filled in and it's

640
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:14,710
looking pretty good so far but it

641
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,970
definitely needs to be cleaned up quite

642
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:17,890
a lot so next I'm just gonna grab that

643
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:19,390
same exact concealer from before and put

644
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:21,190
a little dollop on the back of my hand

645
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:24,160
and then just grabbing my super flat mac

646
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:25,750
242 brush I'm gonna dip right in and I'm

647
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:27,700
gonna use this to clean up the bottom of

648
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:29,950
my brow for me my brush automatically

649
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:32,080
goes right to the arch and I always pull

650
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:33,550
it right underneath the tail and then

651
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:39,820
with any excess product I just bring

652
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:42,040
that right down to the front oh there we

653
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:43,840
go see stunty the Nerds gonna use any

654
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:45,580
excess product on that brush and tap it

655
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,470
into my eyelid to act as an eyelid

656
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:49,090
primer to get it ready for eyeshadow I'm

657
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:50,860
just gonna grab my morphe e 20 brush and

658
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:52,690
dip into it once again at that same

659
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:54,610
exact setting powder and just lightly

660
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:56,440
place this right on top when it comes to

661
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:58,720
the setting powder just like my face I'm

662
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,190
actually not gonna like we set it in

663
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,540
there just because I shadows tend to

664
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:02,470
stick better and be a lot more pigmented

665
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:04,360
when they're kind of blended over

666
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:05,680
something a little bit tacky and now we

667
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:10,350
were officially ready to recreate this

668
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:12,520
blue green brown trio chrome serpent

669
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:14,410
okay so for the eyeshadow look today I

670
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:16,120
don't actually have like a clear image

671
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:17,830
of what I want to do which is pretty

672
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:19,930
rare for me I usually have like a vision

673
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:23,110
and then just go right in but being that

674
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:25,090
the original look was so bad and also so

675
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:26,560
poorly documented because the lighting I

676
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:29,020
don't even know what this was supposed

677
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:30,580
to look like so what I'm just gonna like

678
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:34,030
throw something together that would

679
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:36,850
remind me now of like serpent

680
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:38,020
well even like why would know why I got

681
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:39,520
that I think I'm just gonna start off

682
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:40,900
doing this I look in the same order as

683
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,310
the original video and see where it goes

684
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,450
I'm gonna start off by grabbing my

685
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:45,580
morphe m4 33

686
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:47,500
stepping into a light cool tone brown

687
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:49,990
shade and is putting that right in the

688
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:51,610
crease I'm just going to blend this very

689
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:52,210
very lightly I'm gonna grab that I'm

690
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:53,830
five-eleven

691
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:54,850
and put more of that on there because I

692
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:57,039
have a feeling that this is gonna get

693
00:22:54,850 --> 00:23:00,220
pretty dark now I'm gonna grab at the m4

694
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:01,990
33 again and tip into a little bit of a

695
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:03,880
darker tone Brown I'm gonna place that

696
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:06,130
in the crease to add a little bit more

697
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:07,419
dimension into this I literally don't

698
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:09,429
know what I want to do it for this

699
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:11,260
eyeshadow look I know in the original it

700
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:13,570
looked like I was using a like teal aqua

701
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:16,179
metallic shade all over the lid and then

702
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:17,980
I put like a metallic light green in the

703
00:23:16,179 --> 00:23:22,480
center but then I called it blue

704
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:24,460
somewhere there was blue in the

705
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,230
waterline and it's going in pretty

706
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:27,669
lightly and using back and forth motions

707
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:29,350
using the excess product that's still

708
00:23:27,669 --> 00:23:30,789
left on this brush just make sure that

709
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:32,230
there's an even transition between it

710
00:23:30,789 --> 00:23:35,049
that light brown and the darker brown

711
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:35,919
shade it's looking at pretty good so far

712
00:23:35,049 --> 00:23:39,490
but I don't really know what I'm doing

713
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:41,139
so I'm gonna go the ab 178 brush it's

714
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:43,990
that I just a tiny little concealer

715
00:23:41,139 --> 00:23:49,590
brush and dip into a metallic like aqua

716
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:49,590
watery looking shade oh that's pretty

717
00:23:50,549 --> 00:23:59,350
ot that looks good okay okay okay okay

718
00:23:53,980 --> 00:24:00,639
no places over here as well I guess I'm

719
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:02,110
just gonna fill this into a layer of the

720
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:04,480
blue over top I'm just gonna mix

721
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:07,809
together a dark blue and a dark green

722
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:09,130
and put this right up in here to blend

723
00:24:07,809 --> 00:24:11,740
this together because I don't want this

724
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:14,380
halo eye to be like really really cut so

725
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:16,330
this whole mix that brown and the blue

726
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:17,710
together I really should've done this

727
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:18,909
before placing that metallic shade on

728
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:20,500
there because now this metallic sheen is

729
00:24:18,909 --> 00:24:22,960
gonna get in the crease but everybody

730
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:24,429
makes mistakes and this original look

731
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,630
was one of them so before I move on to

732
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:28,029
us let's halo eye I'm gonna grab that

733
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:29,350
dark brown shade again and just go right

734
00:24:28,029 --> 00:24:31,029
over that little area because that

735
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:33,429
blending is scary

736
00:24:31,029 --> 00:24:34,960
oh that looks way better great moving on

737
00:24:33,429 --> 00:24:36,070
let's forget about that please okay so

738
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,710
now I need to make the halo eye look

739
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:40,389
like an actual halo eye duh so I'm gonna

740
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:42,130
grab an e 37 it's actually a little

741
00:24:40,389 --> 00:24:43,539
liner brush I know most people like to

742
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:45,039
use a little pocket brush for their halo

743
00:24:43,539 --> 00:24:47,470
eyes but for some reason I have like

744
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:49,269
this weird flap of skin that covers my

745
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:51,159
inner corner really rude really annoying

746
00:24:49,269 --> 00:24:52,990
do not ask for it to be there but I

747
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:54,850
really need to like tuck shadow into

748
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:55,559
that region so what I'm gonna do is grab

749
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:57,659
the

750
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:59,700
blue in the dark green once again that I

751
00:24:57,659 --> 00:25:02,999
just used to darken the crease and place

752
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:04,710
that right up in there I'm gonna pull

753
00:25:02,999 --> 00:25:07,080
that right and on top of that metallic

754
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:08,340
shade oh yeah this looks good and we're

755
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,049
just gonna pull that color combo into

756
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,669
like a v-shape in the outer corner you

757
00:25:10,049 --> 00:25:13,139
guys know I love really waiting out my

758
00:25:11,669 --> 00:25:14,879
shadow even honestly if we're like

759
00:25:13,139 --> 00:25:16,649
around looks like a halo eye I'll still

760
00:25:14,879 --> 00:25:17,429
wing it out just a little bit for some

761
00:25:16,649 --> 00:25:18,870
reason round

762
00:25:17,429 --> 00:25:22,710
eye looks just really it's not flat on

763
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:24,419
my face shape so just kind of wing it

764
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:25,649
out for a real one then we got that dark

765
00:25:24,419 --> 00:25:27,330
brown once again and I'm going to go

766
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:28,889
over that outer edge and blend that

767
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:31,259
because it's already looking ugly and I

768
00:25:28,889 --> 00:25:34,080
don't want to make it look any worse I'm

769
00:25:31,259 --> 00:25:37,619
now gonna grab my NAT 2 4 brush and I'm

770
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:40,049
gonna dip into a lighter aqua shade and

771
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:41,490
I'm gonna put this after spritzing it

772
00:25:40,049 --> 00:25:45,090
right on the center of the layer to

773
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:47,759
further accentuate the halo moment okay

774
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:49,919
now I'm happy where the woowoo god bless

775
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:51,570
okay so I'm gonna leave the shadow how

776
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,249
it is because at this point I am

777
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:54,629
horrified at making this look worse I

778
00:25:53,249 --> 00:25:58,409
cannot have my three year anniversary

779
00:25:54,629 --> 00:26:00,720
video be equally as bad as the first one

780
00:25:58,409 --> 00:26:02,100
so what I am going to do though is grab

781
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,389
the Urban Decay liner in the shade of

782
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:06,690
distortion and it's like this bluey

783
00:26:03,389 --> 00:26:07,980
green purple glitter moment it's a

784
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:10,470
serpent and I'm just gonna put this

785
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:12,509
glitter right on that cut crease moment

786
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:13,950
to really make it shine and I'm gonna

787
00:26:12,509 --> 00:26:15,840
pull that right down as well right into

788
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:17,759
the center of that halo eye I'm gonna

789
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:20,519
grab this powder brush and dust off the

790
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:22,139
fallout because there's a lot of it for

791
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:26,240
some reason now for the lower lash line

792
00:26:22,139 --> 00:26:29,340
I think I'm going to mimic the halo onto

793
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,470
the lower lash line as well it's been a

794
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:34,080
long day I'm first gonna grab but this

795
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:36,720
brush is the M 149 and I'm going to tap

796
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:39,360
into the dark blue and green shades once

797
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,070
again and put those right up against the

798
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,720
lash and then I was gonna use that same

799
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:45,480
fluffy brush from before and grab the

800
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,340
light brown shade and go right below

801
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:49,619
that lightly just connecting at that

802
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:51,210
outer V a transition color right into

803
00:26:49,619 --> 00:26:52,139
deep blue just to tie everything

804
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,970
together

805
00:26:52,139 --> 00:26:55,769
could I put the same aqua shade on the

806
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:57,710
lower lash line as well then it's gonna

807
00:26:55,769 --> 00:26:59,120
place that teal shade right

808
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:00,680
in the middle then just got me a little

809
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,300
bit of the mermaid's pigment from

810
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:04,010
peaches makeup one of my all-time

811
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:05,870
favorite brands when it comes to colitas

812
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:07,520
and pigments and popping up right in the

813
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:10,760
center oh that's pretty

814
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:12,020
Wow one thing goes right whoa okay so

815
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,400
next I want to highlight my brow bone

816
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:15,200
and the inner corner just to add more

817
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,880
dimension to this eye look so it'll

818
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,830
really tart pigment in the shade of top

819
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,330
yacht I absolutely love this for

820
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:21,650
highlighting it's literally one of the

821
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:23,930
brightest things I've ever seen in my

822
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:29,600
entire life and I'm going to place that

823
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:31,460
right in there oh so pretty okay then

824
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,300
right on the brow bone for lashes of

825
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,110
course you guys should know at this

826
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:35,000
point I'm gonna use my all-time

827
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:37,190
favorites Lily lashes in the style on

828
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,440
Miami you can use code James for 15% off

829
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:41,150
your purchase Lily as well but I'm going

830
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,010
to trim them first to avoid the whole

831
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:45,740
wonky loss situation and gluing my eye

832
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:46,850
shot because that is not fun um so what

833
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:48,560
I'm gonna do is just grab these with a

834
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:51,260
pair of tweezers and I'm gonna cut off a

835
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:52,790
spike from each end just so they fit my

836
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:54,740
eyes a little bit better then I'm gonna

837
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:56,270
apply a light layer of the duo of brush

838
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:57,950
on and glue and then while that's

839
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:59,810
getting tacky I'm gonna pop on a really

840
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:01,430
light coat of the Mac extended play out

841
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:02,600
mascara and then looking at my we're

842
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:04,820
from right below I'm gonna hold this

843
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:07,580
lash up and I'm gonna plop it right onto

844
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:08,870
my lash line finishing it off with a

845
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:13,480
little bit of mascara right on the lower

846
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:16,100
lash line that was quite the journey

847
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:18,260
there is lots of bumps in the road but

848
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:20,090
we got there in the end are we looking

849
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:22,790
the best No

850
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:25,640
are we looking okay that's for you to

851
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:30,220
decide but regardless that is one blue

852
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:32,690
green and brown trio chrome serpent I

853
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:34,640
complete I'm not going through the other

854
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:36,470
one off camera so I don't literally die

855
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,540
in the next few minutes but I'll be

856
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:40,160
right back to finish how threats of this

857
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:41,540
block be right back

858
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,740
let's go ahead and finish the rest of

859
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:44,570
this look before I decide that I hate it

860
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:45,740
again our first finisher left by just

861
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:46,940
wiping away this bake that's been

862
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:48,470
sitting here for like literally eight

863
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:50,450
hours now while I finished those eyes

864
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:51,900
I'm also going to wipe off the excess

865
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:54,150
underneath my

866
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:55,200
oddballs as well so next was going to be

867
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:56,940
our highlighter but before we do that

868
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,920
once again I'm gonna grab my trusty at

869
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:00,300
prepping set setting spray and just meld

870
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,470
everything together and this also is

871
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:03,780
gonna be the highlighter stick a whole

872
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:06,450
lot more too so we get that really

873
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:08,550
blinding glow and for my hair today I'm

874
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:11,309
gonna grab not a large brush this is the

875
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:13,110
a 501 great highlighter brush that won't

876
00:29:11,309 --> 00:29:15,300
ruin my entire face that makeup and I'm

877
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:19,170
just going to dip into my highlighter

878
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:20,910
pop that right on the cheekbone and now

879
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:23,400
for the nose highlight what I'm going to

880
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:26,160
do is not grab a large fluffy brush this

881
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:28,620
is the e36 it is a tiny pencil brush and

882
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:33,390
I'm going to use this to highlight the

883
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:36,570
tip of my nose Wow look at that so tiny

884
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:38,460
so beautiful and not an inch wide

885
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:40,770
that is how I notice how it's supposed

886
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:43,320
to look okay so far less if we have the

887
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:46,470
lips now in my original video I did a

888
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:48,210
chocolate brown lip with a green and

889
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:49,410
blue pigment over top sorry we're not

890
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:51,090
doing that today because that looked

891
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:53,010
disgusting so what I'm going to do

892
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:56,010
instead is take a lip that is much more

893
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:57,090
flattering to this look and nude I'm

894
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:58,410
gonna start by lining them using my

895
00:29:57,090 --> 00:30:00,750
all-time favorite lip liner this is from

896
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:02,580
colour-pop X I love sonic e in the shade

897
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:04,020
curvy and then over top I'm gonna grab

898
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:06,210
the anasazi liquid lipstick in the shade

899
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:08,100
it stripped and just put that right in

900
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:11,070
the middle and while I definitely do not

901
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:12,390
want to put on a blue green pigment what

902
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:14,130
I am gonna do just to finish off the lip

903
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:15,870
today is out on a tiny bit of gloss

904
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:17,309
right in the center just to give it a

905
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:18,480
little bit more a dimension all right

906
00:30:17,309 --> 00:30:20,400
you guys we're gonna finish it off with

907
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,760
some sister settings Mary one last time

908
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:26,880
just to lock everything in place and

909
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:30,679
finally that is the completed blue brown

910
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,679
green serpent

911
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:35,789

[Music]

913
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:41,170
three hours later I had finally been

914
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:43,210
able to show you guys three years for

915
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:44,320
skill improvement and I really really

916
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:46,060
hope you guys enjoyed this videos today

917
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,500
this look was quite a little bit of a

918
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:49,360
roller coaster to go through but then

919
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:51,280
again the original luck was really

920
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,960
neither good nor fresh so I still feel

921
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,920
like in the end we came up with a really

922
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,940
really beautiful look and I actually

923
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,650

924
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:57,850
