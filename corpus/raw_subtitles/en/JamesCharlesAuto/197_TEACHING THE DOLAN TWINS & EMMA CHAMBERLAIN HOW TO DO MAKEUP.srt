2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:06,859
back to my youtube channel first today's

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,760
video I'm joined with Maya sister squad

4
00:00:06,859 --> 00:00:10,440
first today today we have something very

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,969
very special plan James is going to be

6
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,559
doing her makeup without actually doing

7
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:15,120
her makeup you may be kind of confused

8
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:18,660
how he's gonna do that James is gonna be

9
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,050
wearing a blindfold give me another

10
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,510
chance

11
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,310
Jake okay James is gonna be on the other

12
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,930
side of a wall and he's gonna be telling

13
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,220
us how to do our makeup and he's not

14
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:31,590
gonna be able to see us and some other

15
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:33,210
side of wall we're gonna walk we're

16
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,440
gonna love us dividing the you know

17
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,460
dividing it to say like that because

18
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,620
they know that he's in a different room

19
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,000
okay try again try again well they're

20
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,550
gonna see it I'm like 10 seconds anyway

21
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,340
what textures the wall styrofoam here's

22
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:46,860
the cat there's there's gonna be a

23
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,270
little divider between us and James and

24
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,430
so when James is like he has to explain

25
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,930
it to us he can't touch us or see us yes

26
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,309
this is probably hard for me because I

27
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,989
can definitely man I am a little bit of

28
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:57,629
an egotistical person and I definitely

29
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:59,010
like haha I also enjoy helping people

30
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:00,719
too so this is gonna be really hard for

31
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:03,120
me to try to explain this to them

32
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:23,250
without doing it and I probably gonna

33
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:25,170

gonna draw two upside-down triangles on

105
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,870
your face so you're gonna go basically

106
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:58,850
right from the inner corner of your eye

107
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:00,380
downward you should have said on your

108
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:02,060
eye before I started drawing it on my

109
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:03,230
face jeans what is on your face

110
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:05,849
so you basically want to draw a triangle

111
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:07,349
connecting the inner corner of your eye

112
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:09,090
like are you doing some alumina or

113
00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:10,319

114
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:12,090

green socialblade because we're part of

116
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:15,989

121
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:27,990

hard for me to find it but yes okay and

129
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,849
then like draw a line like underneath

130
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:47,370
that like tracing the bottom of your

131
00:04:44,849 --> 00:04:49,979

translucent setting powder it's like the

136
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:00,979
bait tub with the cop okay open it up

137
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:03,539
and pour a little bit into the cap okay

138
00:05:00,979 --> 00:05:05,280

139
00:05:03,539 --> 00:05:06,900
supposedly vanilla yogurt a little bit

140
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,370

141
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,050
going to look like flashback Mary I

142
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:11,130
think this is where my downfall is no

143
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:12,169
there's a lot of other places that you

144
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:14,280
can fall down later

145
00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:16,289
now we're gonna contour so now that

146
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,280
you're all flat skin tone and you have

147
00:05:16,289 --> 00:05:18,720
your concealer on to brighten up the

148
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,280
center of your face we need to use

149
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,139
contouring to chisel out the outside

150
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,419

00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:35,480
you that has white hairs and probably

316
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,050
has a little bit of oil orange on the

317
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,760
tap

318
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:39,290
now on the top left-hand side of the

319
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,770
palette lives like a mac and cheese type

320
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:44,750
color yes yes dip into that one lightly

321
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:47,510
and then you're gonna put that right in

322
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:49,340
the crease of your eyelash okay I I kind

323
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:51,410
of know how to do this okay cool

324
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:53,930
we'll see how this goes okay cousin what

325
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:55,760
are you doing I'm trying to do my eyelid

326
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:56,990
crease but it's giving me a little

327
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,640
trouble I can't get in

328
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:02,380
I can't get in the inside of my eye does

329
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:04,340
it matter what I only got like the

330
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:05,570
outside half of my eye

331
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:07,130
a little bit a fall out but I mean

332
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:08,960
that's that's expected right how much

333
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:10,340
are you using I mean not that much but I

334
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,440
just also didn't have my brush enough

335
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:14,510
well sister James listen to me you know

336
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,190
you're on the outside half like you've

337
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:17,870
got outer edge like towards your temple

338
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:20,870
yeah yeah why'd you get on the inside

339
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:22,370
because it's a Fed brush that's why it's

340
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:26,840
not that big what are you doing the

341
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:28,820
brush I'm sucking it hitting okay grab

342
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,670
another fluffy brush smaller than that

343
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,770
one

344
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:34,920
okay and I probably should have like a

345
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:36,210
burnt orange shadow on it Oh hope that

346
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,410
whistle I think so

347
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:40,860
now you're gonna want to dip into it

348
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:42,840
it's like a burnt orange there's no yes

349
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,850
okay the one next the one on the right

350
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,080
of it is no the one on the left of that

351
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:48,090
is the more orange with all the right of

352
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,950
it when your advisers colorblind we'll

353
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:51,210
just go with this color okay gray and

354
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:52,350
you wouldnt want to play tap off the

355
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:54,030
excess because you don't want too much

356
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:55,860
to that color and you're gonna want to

357
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:57,900
put that also in your crease but more on

358
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:59,460
the outer like the outer half kind of

359
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:01,140
link blend and like as if it was like

360
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:03,000
like a hook like kinda like going from

361
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:04,860
the outside of your eyeball - like

362
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,010
upwards into the crease like kind of

363
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:09,540
ground a little bit like a drag queen Oh

364
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:10,680
but like any good way though it should

365
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,060
be the same color but you should pack it

366
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,620
like right and I'm like the outer area

367
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:15,930
of your eyelid probably did that already

368
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:21,660
well I'm a step ahead of you I'm done

369
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:24,450
okay okay next okay I think so

370
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:30,360
next up is gonna be um the glitter whoa

371
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:32,310
yay sister sparkle oh hey did I why I

372
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,170
was really good okay oh where did you

373
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:35,670
cut the crease then we're ready to cut

374
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:37,140
the crease okay I love when you're I

375
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:39,180
never cut the crease there's like a

376
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:40,470
rectangular object in there and has a

377
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:42,210
gold cap and it's like how do you

378
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:43,980
remember all this I'm just like thinking

379
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:45,870
right now holy how do you remember all

380
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:48,510
this so since we just ordered a pizza

381
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:49,770
right picture like a corner of a pizza I

382
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:52,680
think it's better be the cheesiest thing

383
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:55,350
ever shut up so start from the tear duct

384
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:57,240
and go up around dad like towards the

385
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:59,700
middle of your crease and then fill it

386
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:02,220
in so the entire inner half of your

387
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:04,910
eyelid is glitter tilt your head back

388
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:06,620
and look in the mirror

389
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:08,690
so then you have access to it without

390
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:11,090
having to like access to it I've

391
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:13,460
unlocked access to my eyelid how's it

392
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:14,420
look actually not bad like I mean it's

393
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:16,280
not my best work

394
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,570
this is like the tutorial for somebody

395
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,490
who like it's like me

396
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:21,020
it's an attainable look you know what

397
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:23,450
I'm saying right now it's time for

398
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:25,670
eyeliner I need the support that I want

399
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:27,170
to skip don't get that off sad when

400
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:29,480
James Charles forces you into doing

401
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:30,860
things that you don't want to do excuse

402
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,620
me have you ever done a winged liner

403
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:37,130
before no oh okay let's get a nose wire

404
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:39,230
okay so grab it's like a brown stick got

405
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:43,040
it it's shimmery it says Tom for your on

406
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:44,270
it okay there's two ends to it wine it's

407
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,710
like a really really tiny point and

408
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:47,930
one's like more of like a felt tip

409
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:49,430
marker point got it you want the felt

410
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:51,740
tip side okay so you're gonna start off

411
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:54,800
by drawing a line from like a very thin

412
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:56,750
line from the very outer like corner of

413
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:01,190
your eye it should be like thin thin

414
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:04,520
yeah right about that um help think did

415
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:05,720
you make it um that's what she said I'm

416
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,160
when I get nervous I start saying that's

417
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,270
what she said jokes I could clean that

418
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,440
up with concealer though I think

419
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:10,610
basically it's like your boyfriend

420
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,380
cheats on you right and you thought he

421
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:14,630
was the man of your dreams he was

422
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:16,040
beautiful he was perfect and then you

423
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:18,920
know a new man comes into your life and

424
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:20,510
he's like 30 times hotter not only that

425
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:23,270
listens to the same type of music as you

426
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:25,820
not only that but also I'm not gonna say

427
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:28,190
that on James's channel and moral the

428
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:29,510
story is you're now winning right it's

429
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:31,520
like the best rebound you've ever had

430
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:32,900
and that is how I'm feeling right now

431
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,790
with this winged eyeliner except for

432
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,450
that I am still lonely and single that's

433
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:39,050

453
00:16:31,309 --> 00:16:38,689

454
00:16:35,139 --> 00:16:40,519
onto the lash band okay so is the glue

455
00:16:38,689 --> 00:16:42,619
on there yes okay so you want to like

456
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:44,269
blow on it a little bit so grab it with

457
00:16:42,619 --> 00:16:46,519
the tweezer okay tilt your head back

458
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:47,779
slightly and put your face I close to

459
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:49,850
the mirror and then you want to plop

460
00:16:47,779 --> 00:16:51,709
your lash on going from the center of

461
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:53,540
your eye and place it like right on

462
00:16:51,709 --> 00:16:56,089
there as close to the lash line as

463
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:57,379
possible and then once the center of the

464
00:16:56,089 --> 00:16:59,809
lash is like on the center of your

465
00:16:57,379 --> 00:17:01,369
eyelid use the tweezers to make sure

466
00:16:59,809 --> 00:17:03,619
that the outer corner and inner corner

467
00:17:01,369 --> 00:17:15,760
are both on your eyelid fully so just

468
00:17:03,619 --> 00:17:19,100
take the top okay tape whoa really good

469
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:21,409
and you want to put it down as close to

470
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:22,579
your lash line as you possibly can it's

471
00:17:21,409 --> 00:17:23,929
like it looks like it's growing out of

472
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:26,329
your lens it's not make sense

473
00:17:23,929 --> 00:17:28,610
it didn't stick I stuck it right where

474
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:31,309
you told me to stay take the lock off

475
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:33,830
okay and then put more glue on there and

476
00:17:31,309 --> 00:17:35,000
then blow on it a little bit now like

477
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:36,620
we've it around a little bit don't put

478
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,450
it on right away like wait for it to get

479
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:40,519
tacky and it's so cute how you're

480
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:41,779
focusing so hard on me yeah use it work

481
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:43,370
okay now we're gonna put our mascara on

482
00:17:41,779 --> 00:17:44,899
the upper and lower you're gonna put it

483
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:46,880
on the upper lashes really carefully

484
00:17:44,899 --> 00:17:48,500
because if you go on too hard it can

485
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,639
pull the wash off so you just kind of

486
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:52,120
want to use that and do it lightly to

487
00:17:49,639 --> 00:17:53,440
blend together your real lashes or the

488
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:55,510

493
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:13,809

when I first put it on I look at it were

504
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:41,590

cheekbones I'm actually like not bad at

00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:01,360
highlight because I feel like that's the

516
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:03,160
easiest part

517
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,570

and you're gonna want to put it right in

526
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:21,790
the inner corners of your eyes okay

527
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:24,429
right like under the arch of your

right in between those two contour lines

535
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,480
don't make it too wide or that ruins the

536
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:39,010
illusion and then stock right before the

537
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,960
tip and then leave a little space then

538
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:45,610
