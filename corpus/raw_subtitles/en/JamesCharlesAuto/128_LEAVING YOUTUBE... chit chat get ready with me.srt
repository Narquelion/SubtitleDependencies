I also took a little bit of a break and

17
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,279
had a little bit of a breakdown on

18
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,019
Twitter a few weeks ago as well which I

19
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,309
definitely want to talk about so yeah

20
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:34,770

grab your popcorn Geiger Pinkett Eve

28
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:53,940
Jenkins because this is going to be a

29
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:54,989
long one and let's get glam so I'm

30
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,820
obviously starting off with my base

31
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:58,559
already done I went ahead and did my

32
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,609
foundation at concealer of brows and

33
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,500
contour and powdered everything

34
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:03,120
off-camera same exact routine that I use

35
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,799
every single time so let's just go in

36
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,390
with the eyes for today's eye shadow

37
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,979
look we're gonna be using two very very

38
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,170
unique palettes that I never use on my

39
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:12,000
channel being the morphe 35o and the

40
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,439
morphe 35o palette I want to create like

41
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,689
a sunset I look so I'm gonna start off

42
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,820
by guarding my m4 for one brush and dip

43
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:19,350
into this late transition

44
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,670
oMG shade right here and put it in the

45
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:22,020
crease while I'm doing my eyes I do

46
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,340
definitely wanna talk about the negative

47
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,750
with you guys before we get into the fun

48
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,970
and positive things for the remainder

49
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,680
and majority of this video but I do just

50
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,240
want to address this and that is kind of

51
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,130
why I took a little bit of a break from

52
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,960
YouTube and social media for a few days

53
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,400
and also why I've been a little bit down

54
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,470
in the dumps when it comes to like

55
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,880
Twitter and filming lately I feel like a

56
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,799
lot of social media influencers just

57
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,570
live their lives and our lives look so

58
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,490
crazy and fun to you guys on the outside

59
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,810
but on the inside there's a lot of stuff

60
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:47,670
that goes on behind the scenes and a lot

61
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,689
of emotions behind it and I feel like a

62
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,170
lot of people don't like to talk about

63
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:53,909
that and I definitely happen to talk

64
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:56,430
about that a lot I'm next intagram IM

65
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:58,200
433 and dip into this warm tone orange

66
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,579
shade away over here I would definitely

67
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,130
talk to you guys about how I was feeling

68
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:03,149
and sometimes being a social media

69
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:05,750
influence or having an online

70
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:06,920
personality is really really hard

71
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,540
and I'm not talking about on a physical

72
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,590
level because let's be real we literally

73
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:11,270
sit in front of a camera and make

74
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:13,190
freakin makeup tutorials in our

75
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:14,810
underwear for a living so I definitely

76
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:17,060
am NOT talking about on a physical level

77
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:19,100
but on an emotional level is where this

78
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:21,080
job can be sometimes really really

79
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,490
really stressful and super overwhelming

80
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,230
up next we have another clean M for

81
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:26,030
three three and dip into the Mac blush

82
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:27,440
in the shade sketch simply because I

83
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:28,730
don't have a good maroon eyeshadow that

84
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,540
I really like I know when it comes to a

85
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:31,340
lot of social media influencers

86
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,600
including myself a lot of us like to

87
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,460
pretend that hate comments don't get to

88
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,350
us I mean you always see us doing like

89
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,760
reading hate home videos or posting hate

90
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:39,890
tweets on Twitter just to give like a

91
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,850
good laugh for you guys but honestly at

92
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:42,980
the end of the day I don't care what

93
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:44,120
anybody says one thousands and thousands

94
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:46,160
and thousands I hate comments are coming

95
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,900
in eventually they're gonna start to get

96
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,550
to you and is sometimes really really

97
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,230
hard to focus on the positive when there

98
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:52,430
is so much negativity on the internet

99
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:53,990
let's be real I've definitely made a lot

100
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:55,970
of mistakes in the past that I am not

101
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:57,170
proud of but I've apologized and own up

102
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:58,790
to every single one of them which i

103
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:00,410
think is really really vital in order to

104
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:02,300
grow and become a better person but

105
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:04,220
let's also be real and saying that I

106
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:06,050
definitely am an easy target for the

107
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,890
internet to pick on in laughi at the end

108
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:07,940
of the day a lot of people said that

109
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:09,769
hate comments don't get to them

110
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,970
including myself I really try hard and

111
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:12,800
not let hate give to me I'm just to

112
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:14,750
focus on the positivity because there is

113
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,640
so much positivity with you guys but

114
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:18,320
when you do start to receive thousands

115
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,269
and thousands of hate comments on like a

116
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,500
video or a tweet that you pose it really

117
00:03:20,269 --> 00:03:22,970
can put a lot of pressure on you and

118
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,160
make you start to question your morals

119
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:27,380
and why are doing what you do and for me

120
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,760
if that happens relatively often have

121
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,780
you been following me on snap or Twitter

122
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,850
for a while you would know that there

123
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:33,200
was a time about two weeks ago where I

124
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:36,019
had a little bit of a breakdown on

125
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,250
snapchat video I was filming and I did

126
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:39,320
actually end up taking a break from

127
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,880
social media completely for a few days

128
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,950
because everything just got really

129
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,959
really overwhelming and I want you guys

130
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:46,430
to know that it's okay I'm nice tender

131
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,870
grab that same M for three three and dip

132
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:49,519
into at these two purple shades right

133
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,989
here and use that to deepen up the

134
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,310
crease when I talk about this openly

135
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:54,290
with you guys I don't want you to think

136
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:56,299
I'm complaining or ungrateful in any way

137
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:58,549
shape or form because but isn't the case

138
00:03:56,299 --> 00:04:00,049
at all in fact what I tweeted that I

139
00:03:58,549 --> 00:04:01,910
needed a few days to take a mental break

140
00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:03,530
I got so many amazing messages from all

141
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:04,940
of you guys that completely understood

142
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:06,590
where I was coming from which meant the

143
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:08,239
entire world to me I also got a lot of

144
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:09,620
tweets and messages saying oh my god

145
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,480
you're 18 years old living in the middle

146
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:13,760
of LA like I said I am so thankful to be

147
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:15,830
living a very very kind life thanks to

148
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,090
you guys but at the end of the day there

149
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,690
is no amount of money that can buy

150
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,000
happiness

151
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:21,560
trust me on this one and unfortunately

152
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,670
with this job often comes a lot of

153
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,350
pressure like I said and a lot of

154
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:26,960
responsibility and a lot of negativity

155
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:28,430
as well so sometimes that happiness can

156
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,420
be really really hard to find no matter

157
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:31,280
how much money is in your bank account

158
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:32,570
no matter how many cool opportunities

159
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,710
you're having it no matter what car you

160
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:35,480
drive where you're living

161
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:37,220
happiness comes from within and

162
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,930
sometimes no matter who you are what

163
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:40,610
you're doing what your job is you need

164
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:43,040
to take a mental break because mental

165
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:44,390
health is so so so so so important and

166
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,280
definitely needs to come before any type

167
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:47,510
of post on social media I don't want to

168
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,190
sound like I'm complaining or ungrateful

169
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:51,080
in any way shape or form there are so

170
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:52,250
many more important and awful things

171
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,620
going on in the world right now that

172
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:56,420
make my issues literally non-existent

173
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,650
but I do just want to have an open

174
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,730
conversation with you guys about this

175
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:00,200
because I know it's something that not a

176
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:01,970
lot of influencers address but I

177
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,530
definitely do and I know a lot of you

178
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:04,850
guys do look up to me as well not only

179
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:06,440
for makeup but also for life advice

180
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:08,240
which means literally the entire world

181
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,800
to me and I do try best to be a good

182
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,690
role model obviously of course we're

183
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,430
gonna fail sometimes but if you were

184
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:14,900
like me a few weeks ago and you do get

185
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:17,090
in a rut or you're not feeling creative

186
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,350
or inspired take a few days off do it

187
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:19,940
every night or do to get your heart back

188
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:21,680
in the game mental health is so

189
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:23,120
important so sometimes taking a break is

190
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,710
totally okay and I definitely wanted to

191
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,669
share that message with you guys I know

192
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:27,020
it's well a lot of people were wondering

193
00:05:25,669 --> 00:05:29,360
whether or not I was gonna quit YouTube

194
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:31,010
and obviously hello I am here I don't

195
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,450
plan on leaving anytime soon I have a

196
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:33,770
lot of really really good content coming

197
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:34,910
out and a lot of products that I'm

198
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:37,100
working on that I am literally so

199
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:38,510
excited for you guys to see but like I

200
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,760
said definitely needed a few days off

201
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:41,870
but sister is back and ready to go so

202
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,610
now that we have up all the negative out

203
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:45,230
of the way thank God we can focus on the

204
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:46,880
positive but before we get into that I'm

205
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:48,860
gonna grab some more shave tape in the

206
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,900
shade lights and and just put a little

207
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:55,130
bit on the back of my hand and grabbing

208
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:59,030
my way to go morphe and a four-to-one

209
00:05:55,130 --> 00:06:00,530
brush I'm gonna cut the crease and then

210
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:02,060
quickly keeping my head tilted back so

211
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:04,700
it doesn't crease I'm gonna grab my M 4

212
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:06,590
to 5 brush and dip into my Kodi Ariston

213
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:09,080
powder and then set that concealer in

214
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:10,669
place and then without saying M 45 brush

215
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,620
I'm just gonna dip into this light bone

216
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:14,210
color shade up in here and just set that

217
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:16,040
in place for once I'm actually gonna

218
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:17,840
keep this eye look fully matte aside

219
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,430
from the Bravo and Haley of course but I

220
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,530
really it's been a long time since I've

221
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:22,729
done a matte crease I usually end up

222
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:24,680
doing some type of a

223
00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:26,419
shimmer on the lid but I'm kind of

224
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,830
getting tired of that right now so why

225
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:29,419
don't do a little bit of a matte sunset

226
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:31,849
look okay so onto a more positive note

227
00:06:29,419 --> 00:06:32,990
while I clean up this crease please but

228
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:34,520
so many fun things have been happening

229
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:36,169
lately and I'm so excited that you guys

230
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,930
are finally getting to see them if you

231
00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:40,699
saw last week my clothing line sister's

232
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:43,309
apparel finally dropped and you guys

233
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:45,710
went crazy I think we literally sold

234
00:06:43,309 --> 00:06:48,589
almost 2,000 hoodies in under 24 hours

235
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:49,520
which is literally so insane I cannot

236
00:06:48,589 --> 00:06:50,870
wait for you guys to all get your

237
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,129
sister's hoodies so you can take me your

238
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:54,349
little pictures and your flashback

239
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:55,550
Mary's oh my god I just cannot wait I've

240
00:06:54,349 --> 00:06:57,620
been working on such as apparel for

241
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:58,909
literally so long and I'm just so

242
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,860
excited that you guys are equally as

243
00:06:58,909 --> 00:07:02,509
excited as I am and I also have a lot of

244
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,649
fun designs planned for the future as

245
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:05,210
well and a lot of things that are being

246
00:07:03,649 --> 00:07:06,710
manufactured that are a lot more

247
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:08,330
complicated than just hoodies and hats

248
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:10,339
so definitely keep your eyes peeled

249
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:12,080
because I bake big plans for sister's

250
00:07:10,339 --> 00:07:13,789
apparel also if you guys saw my acapella

251
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,249
group flashback released our first ever

252
00:07:13,789 --> 00:07:18,620
cover this past Friday on my youtube

253
00:07:16,249 --> 00:07:20,120
channel and I cannot even thank you guys

254
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:21,889
enough for the positive response we got

255
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,960
so many of you guys absolutely love the

256
00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:25,580
song and we were so so so nervous but

257
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,709
also excited to put it out music

258
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:29,120
obviously is a huge huge aspect of our

259
00:07:27,709 --> 00:07:31,550
life that you guys really do not get to

260
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,229
see much up until recently on my youtube

261
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:34,610
channel but I'm very very excited that I

262
00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:36,709
get to share that with you guys now and

263
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:38,419
we have so many exciting covers coming

264
00:07:36,709 --> 00:07:41,330
soon on Pascha that you guys are going

265
00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:42,589
to love this is just very very exciting

266
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,879
for me because I've been singing with my

267
00:07:42,589 --> 00:07:45,289
best friend Anthony who's actually in

268
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:47,360
the crew many of you guys know him since

269
00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:48,409
literally we were in third grade and

270
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,270
we've been trying to put together an

271
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:52,099
acapella group for literally like almost

272
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:53,419
10 years now so we are so excited that

273
00:07:52,099 --> 00:07:55,430
we finally have a really good at group

274
00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:56,749
of solid super super talented kids that

275
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:58,159
all share the same love for music so

276
00:07:56,749 --> 00:08:00,319
definitely keep your eyes peeled for

277
00:07:58,159 --> 00:08:01,370
future flash projects because it is

278
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,409
definitely a group you were going to

279
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:04,399
want to watch trust me on that one I

280
00:08:03,409 --> 00:08:05,479
think this look definitely needs a

281
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:07,129
little bit of a wing so I'm gonna grab

282
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:09,469
my Kat Von D tattoo liner in the shade

283
00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:11,330
trooper and just sketch out a sharp eye

284
00:08:09,469 --> 00:08:12,620
swing ready to cut somebody that is

285
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:14,509
definitely a large in the charged wing

286
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:16,580
but honestly I am kind of living for it

287
00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:17,719
I'm gonna grab my e43 brush from morphe

288
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,490
and then a little bit more shape tape

289
00:08:17,719 --> 00:08:21,610
and just clean up the shadow below the

290
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,610
way

291
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:25,949
I'm next area by NYX wonder pencil in

292
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:29,070
the shade of light and just put that in

293
00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:30,210
my waterline same exact thing with the

294
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:32,279
upper that I'm gonna first off with my

295
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:33,659
m4 for one and a bright orange shade and

296
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:35,099
disc all really really lightly

297
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:37,469
underneath the eye to create a

298
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:38,729
transition shade I'm also not breaking

299
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:40,589
the shade fully to the inner corner

300
00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:42,330
either because I do like to when I do

301
00:08:40,589 --> 00:08:43,589
these paper I looks cut out that inner

302
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:45,240
corner so it makes my eyes look a little

303
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:46,650
bit bigger and wider I'll show you guys

304
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,510
in a second I'm next I'm gonna have an M

305
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:50,550
at 213 and dip into that dark purple

306
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:52,470
shade from the 35b and connect the

307
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:54,089
winged liner and use this to hug the

308
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:55,650
lash line when I have this rush my hand

309
00:08:54,089 --> 00:08:56,880
with the purple when I get to the inner

310
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:59,160
corner I'm going to really really

311
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,720
lightly pull that forward as opposed to

312
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:03,150
following my natural eye shape and going

313
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,410
up I'm just creating kind of a second

314
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,850
little crease up in here and then I'm

315
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:07,950
gonna clean that up with concealer in

316
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:09,390
this area this is very similar to drag

317
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:11,010
makeup which just makes my eyes look a

318
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:12,750
little bit bigger then once again we're

319
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:14,820
gonna grab Miami 151 and dip into the

320
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,930
Mac blush and the shade is sketch to

321
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,490
blend together that orange and purple

322
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,750
alright so that is when I all completed

323
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,279
that was simply a very very lengthy

324
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,020
process and turned out a lot more

325
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:24,000
intense and I was planning on a but I

326
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,930
really really like this look so far so

327
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,279
I'm gonna go into the other one off

328
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:27,779
camera quickly and I'll be right back to

329
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:29,250
finish off the rest of the eyes and the

330
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:30,480
rest of the face alright so that is the

331
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:32,010
other eye all complete this is

332
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,450
definitely a lot more intense of a look

333
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:35,790
than I was originally expecting or going

334
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:37,620
for but I'm honestly it kind of loving

335
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:38,190
for it or kind of loving for it oh my

336
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,660
god

337
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:41,700
four lashes today I'm gonna go to the

338
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:44,520
Lily lash in the style Alena these

339
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:45,959
lashes are so so so beautiful they're

340
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:47,760
like very very good because they're big

341
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:49,800
on the outside but tiny on the inside

342
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,060
I definitely like these a lot what I'm

343
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,709
doing this I make sure to get super

344
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:55,260
close up to the root of the lash right

345
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:57,029
up in that upper waterline just because

346
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:58,260
I don't ever do it black in the upper

347
00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:00,150
waterline anymore because it always

348
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,740
makes me super uncomfortable where

349
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:03,660
throughout the day I always find myself

350
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,040
picking at my lashes at my waterline

351
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,420
because it always ends up transferring

352
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,459
and it just makes my eyes feel really

353
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,900
really bad so I stopped doing that and

354
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:12,120
it's made my life I don't see a million

355
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,709
times easier but now that I do mascara I

356
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,360
have to really make sure it's black up

357
00:10:13,709 --> 00:10:16,650
in that region so it doesn't look really

358
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,540
really dumb when I'm looking forward

359
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:19,800
like this sensor is a sunset look I

360
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:22,080
definitely wanna have a very golden

361
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,550
sunkissed highlight going on so of

362
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,529
course I'm gonna grab my Anasazi upsell

363
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:27,690
Hollywood illuminator and mix it with my

364
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:28,019
mary-lou manizer from the balm and I

365
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:29,279
also

366
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:33,839
gonna include a little bit of this ink

367
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:35,100
lot pigment in the shade 7 of course got

368
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,509
a highlight above the brow bone as well

369
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,920
this is what my all-time favorite makeup

370
00:10:36,509 --> 00:10:39,449
tricks and they get a lot of questions

371
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,489
about this too and why I do this and it

372
00:10:39,449 --> 00:10:42,929
is because when you take photos from

373
00:10:41,489 --> 00:10:45,480
either the side it gives you that nice

374
00:10:42,929 --> 00:10:46,679
like glow like right there but also I

375
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,290
personally like it because when I take

376
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:50,730
photos front on it reflects obviously

377
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:52,649
here and here which makes my face look

378
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:54,629
wider and I like my face to look really

379
00:10:52,649 --> 00:10:56,639
really wide and chisel because of my jaw

380
00:10:54,629 --> 00:10:58,679
line I do have a very very long face so

381
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,209
I like to kind of slim it down just the

382
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:01,499
slightest bit and this trick really

383
00:11:00,209 --> 00:11:02,549
really helps and to make sure my

384
00:11:01,499 --> 00:11:03,749
highlight and contour are nice and

385
00:11:02,549 --> 00:11:05,819
blended together I'm gonna grab the Mac

386
00:11:03,749 --> 00:11:15,470
blush in the shade up pinch me and my

387
00:11:05,819 --> 00:11:17,399
morphe morphe my morphe for bronze

388
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:18,809
alright so for the lipid II doodahs

389
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:20,610
today I'm going to using a brand new

390
00:11:18,809 --> 00:11:23,009
product for my sistas over at covergirl

391
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:24,540
and those are the melting pout lipsticks

392
00:11:23,009 --> 00:11:25,350
they come in these cute little squeeze

393
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,029
tubes and there are a ton of different

394
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:28,889
shades I just picked out for that I

395
00:11:27,029 --> 00:11:30,179
think might match I'm gonna do a little

396
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:31,350
bit of a swatch just do you want to look

397
00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:32,999
good on the actual lips

398
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:34,589
I feel like this nude shade number 105

399
00:11:32,999 --> 00:11:38,189
is a little bit too a pinky for this

400
00:11:34,589 --> 00:11:39,929
look umm let's test number 140 this

401
00:11:38,189 --> 00:11:41,850
definitely could be really really pretty

402
00:11:39,929 --> 00:11:43,410
honestly I think number 135 is a little

403
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:44,490
bit too much of a blue tone shade purple

404
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:48,540
for this look so that one's gonna be a

405
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:51,119
now and then number 150 Oh number 150

406
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:52,920
looks really good I definitely think I

407
00:11:51,119 --> 00:11:54,119
want to go into the shade number 150 but

408
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,639
before I do that I'm gonna grab the

409
00:11:54,119 --> 00:11:58,170
covergirl farewell feathering liner this

410
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,329
is also a new product and it's basically

411
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:01,679
a lip liner but it's invisible and it

412
00:12:00,329 --> 00:12:03,449
goes on and it stops here at liquid

413
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:05,100
lipsticks or any lipsticks from moving

414
00:12:03,449 --> 00:12:06,240
around which is so so great then I'm

415
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:10,079
gonna go ahead and apply shade number

416
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,699
150 oh yeah

417
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,139
okay so I actually really really like

418
00:12:11,699 --> 00:12:14,819
how this lip turned out it went on super

419
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:16,769
super smooth as you can see it is

420
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:17,879
obviously a liquid lipstick formula but

421
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:20,850
it didn't write out an auto percent

422
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:22,740
matte which I don't mind as well it is a

423
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:24,360
dark ready cranberry shade which is

424
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,040
usually a red flag when it comes to

425
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:28,019
lipsticks because they usually are very

426
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,249
very patchy but with this the formula

427
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:31,259
actually looks really really consistent

428
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:33,179
so these are definite winds for me as

429
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:34,679
well the lip liner is great as you can

430
00:12:33,179 --> 00:12:36,959
see my lip line is super smooth and

431
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:37,919
strong so I love it okay so finally to

432
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,329
finish off this look I'm going to grab

433
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:39,840
my Urban Decay all nighter setting spray

434
00:12:39,329 --> 00:12:45,870
and give my

435
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:47,550
they say quick little spritz alright

436
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:49,440
guys so that is this sunset cranberry

437
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:51,570
look I'll complete this definitely got a

438
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,250
lot more dark intense and vampy than I

439
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:54,930
originally anticipated I was going for a

440
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:56,760
little bit of a lighter eye at first but

441
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:59,360
I actually really really like how this

442
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:01,650
came out as well I guess follows like

443
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,330
relatively soon I mean like I'm ready

444
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:05,040
for spooky times and ready for pumpkins

445
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:06,600
Halloween you name it so I guess we're

446
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,030
just jumping the gun a little bit but

447
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,110
who cares I like this look as well I

448
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:11,700
