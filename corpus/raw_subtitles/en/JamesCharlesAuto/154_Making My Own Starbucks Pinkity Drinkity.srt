16
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:31,830
some of my favorite memories to date we

17
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,390

21
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:43,920

thought it was just like part of my

80
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:57,670
brand to snapchat it all the time but no

81
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:59,319
literally every single day I'm obsessed

82
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:00,459
with it I'm addicted and I've been

83
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:02,739
posting about it for a very very long

84
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:06,580
time too to try to get a brand deal and

85
00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:08,500
alas here we are today still without

86
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:10,299
wine fun facts for you guys it actually

87
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,799
used to be on the Starbucks secret menu

88
00:03:10,299 --> 00:03:13,450
as just a strawberry honestly refresher

89
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:15,730

93
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:21,640

94
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:23,769
menu like we actually did that which i

95
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,239

96
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:26,980
out of bed and was craving a pink drink

97
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:28,329
as always but I really was feeling lazy

98
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:30,850
and did not want to leave the house and

99
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:33,040
I thought to myself I bet I can make

100
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:34,930
this myself right here at home so for

101
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,820

it's pumpkin really it's not for Sachi I

132
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:27,890
was the expert on all things not related

133
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:29,960
so we're trying to recreate this exact

134
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:32,240
loaf today so our first step we are go

135
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:34,640
ahead and preheated our oven to 350

136
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,860
degrees and she's in the back heating up

137
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:38,540
for a real one and now we have our large

138
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,680
mixing bowl for my mini kitchen and that

139
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:43,130
we are going to mix our dry ingredients

140
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:46,390
into so first we need 1 and 1/2 cups of

141
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:48,920
all-purpose flour really shove your

142
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:52,730
measuring cup in there how do I get it

143
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:55,490
full so there's one ich cup of flour and

144
00:05:52,730 --> 00:06:01,810
now we have our half a cup 1 teaspoon of

145
00:05:55,490 --> 00:06:05,900
baking soda that smells strong oh wow ok

146
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:08,270
1 teaspoon of ground nutmeg cinnamon

147
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:10,670
without cinnamon challenge let's go

148
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:13,100
ladies pasta I thought it was so easy I

149
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:16,100
just swallowed it it looks so good

150
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:20,200
Yatta is one teaspoon of cinnamon 1

151
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:22,940
teaspoon of ground what the clove

152
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:24,200
that sounds very strong it will just

153
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:32,450
look a little bit less than a teaspoon

154
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:34,300
of us I don't like this we have to use

155
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:36,680
baking powder too

156
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:49,610
I'm already bored how about teaspoon of

157
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:51,260
salt the covers on there's a lid on it

158
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:55,730
first of all I'm not stupid

159
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:59,900
oh we need to do this in separate bowls

160
00:06:55,730 --> 00:07:04,070
I took a lot of work I'm gonna transfer

161
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:05,450
this powder mixture over to this bowl

162
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:08,300
because I need to beat my other things

163
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:10,340
together in this one now I have to beat

164
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,660

scoop the excess out of here now we're

192
00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:48,529
gonna grab our pumpkin seeds because we

193
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:51,350
need to sprinkle them on top so it

194
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:54,410
creates that nice crunchy crust on the

195
00:08:51,350 --> 00:09:00,319
bread this ziplock bag and we're going

196
00:08:54,410 --> 00:09:01,490
to put our pumpkin seeds in there and

197
00:09:00,319 --> 00:09:23,269
now we're just gonna take this rolling

198
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:27,529
pin and really crunch it off what

199
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:30,560
somebody your pumpkin powder

200
00:09:27,529 --> 00:09:32,149
we're sprinkle this right on top I know

201
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:40,370
I'm even thinking steak right none of

202
00:09:32,149 --> 00:09:41,420
you are now 70 minutes all right you

203
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:43,069
guys now that our pumpkin bread is all

204
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,660
ready to go and nice and coated we're

205
00:09:43,069 --> 00:09:47,690
going to pop this in the oven at 350

206
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:49,639
degrees for 70 minutes I thought this

207
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:51,949
was gonna be a quick video to film I was

208
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:53,240
wrong are we surprised no we're

209
00:09:51,949 --> 00:09:54,889
basically gonna let this cook until the

210
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:57,319
top is a dark brown we can stick a

211
00:09:54,889 --> 00:09:58,550
toothpick Anna and nothing comes out and

212
00:09:57,319 --> 00:10:01,940
then we're gonna have to let it cool for

213
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:03,260
many more minutes so I'll see you looks

214
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:10,100
like a porn Tower

215
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:13,339
Oh time for the pink drink all right

216
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:14,930
sisters it is pink kitty drink any time

217
00:10:13,339 --> 00:10:15,460
and we have all of our ingredients right

218
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:16,750
here

219
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:18,339
the pumpkin bright is about to be done

220
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:20,950
so it's the perfect time to start making

221
00:10:18,339 --> 00:10:22,810
our drink so we can sister sip while we

222
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:25,930
get ready for our breakfast that has

223
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:28,060
taken us two hours so far using a large

224
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:31,510
measuring cup filled with 16 ounces of

225
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:32,770
cold water well that's all like that's

226
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:34,510
nothing so now that I started this

227
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:36,190
recipe is to identify at pocket of the

228
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,820
Starbucks insert refreshers now don't

229
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:38,350
get me wrong

230
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,490
I love Starbucks but I'm slightly

231
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:40,800
annoyed that I have to use this because

232
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:43,180
it definitely makes it feel less

233
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,649
homemade but at the same time we were

234
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:46,779
going for that authentic pink candy

235
00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:48,310
drink edite so you gotta do what you

236
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:50,230
gotta do I picked it would be a very

237
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:53,080
very hibiscus refresher it's gonna pour

238
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:55,480
this in to our nice little cup here

239
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:59,260
right now in order to prepare I went

240
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:02,560
ahead and I boiled 1 cup water on top of

241
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:06,580
my stove so we can make some tea oh it's

242
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:09,459
hot oh now we're gonna get one pocket of

243
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:11,080
the itas Oh a passionate tea now if you

244
00:11:09,459 --> 00:11:12,910
have been a long time with Starbucks the

245
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,560
sister before we had the pink drink all

246
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:16,570
of us typical white girls used to get

247
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,580
our passion tea lemonade and this is

248
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:20,260
what they used to make this stuff it's

249
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:21,790
honestly really good for us were just

250
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:23,290
going to put that in there

251
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:24,880
no we have to wait there's way too much

252
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:26,380
waiting in these recipes might as well

253
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,360
just go to Starbucks and get it I put a

254
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:29,860
bunch of Starbucks at least 10 times and

255
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:37,839
back by now and the time is taking us to

256
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:39,700
fill this video no yeah it cost forty

257
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:43,570
seven dollars for the ingredients of

258
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:47,260
this yeah you are kidding no oh my god

259
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:49,089
forty seven dollars no and this is not

260
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:51,520
worth it in any way shape and/or form

261
00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:52,930
for the time nor the money this just

262
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,330
turned into a Starbucks prandial I mean

263
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:57,760
it already was even go get two three

264
00:11:55,330 --> 00:12:00,070
drinks the pump everybody what the heck

265
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,890
now we've let our tea steep in the pot

266
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:04,360
and get nice and juicy for about five

267
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:06,130
minutes now so I'm just going to take

268
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,900
this and I'm going to squeeze the

269
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:09,220
remaining juices out this has been a way

270
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:11,290
too long of a process but I will say it

271
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,900
smells amazing and this kitchen right

272
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:13,520
now

273
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:16,000
my god so now we're going to take our

274
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:18,860
passion tea and mix it together with our

275
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:23,090
very very hibiscus refresher looking

276
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:24,200
beautiful is this it like even now now

277
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:26,060
we're just gonna take our reusable

278
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:29,480
Starbucks a tumbler with our reusable

279
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:31,760
straw and fill it with some nice chunks

280
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,140
of ice but like a little bit of ice Oh

281
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,420
tippy forming a cold drink from

282
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:37,040
Starbucks you said a 100% always order

283
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:40,100
light ice ordering light ice is just say

284
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:42,290
far better drink - iced ratio Assoc for

285
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,850
the price sisters not a budget now we're

286
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:46,040
gonna take our mixture and pour the cup

287
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:48,080
until it is halfway full

288
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:49,490
and obviously every brace that makes

289
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,080
pink drinks differently but I personally

290
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:53,810
prefer when there's a little bit more

291
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:55,850
pink and then there is drink a 4060

292
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:57,770
ratio of the pink drink and the coconut

293
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:59,030
milk but obviously personal preference

294
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:01,190
we're just gonna top the rest off with

295
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:05,300
some unsweetened coconut milk we're just

296
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:07,010
gonna fill the rest up beautiful oh our

297
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:10,130
pumpkin breads done a perfect timing

298
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:14,510
okay wait wait I don't know oh shoot Oh

299
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:16,760

300
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:24,010
that is good and fresh unless you are

301
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:27,680
cute a toast let's do our toothpick test

302
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:30,140
clean it's done okay now we have to put

303
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,090
this in at the fridge for 30 minutes to

304
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:33,290
cool down we don't have 30 minutes so

305
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:36,080
we're going to put this in the freezer

306
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:37,460
and hope that it gets chilly quickly

307
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,630
because we have to go this has taken

308
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:40,040
three hours already

309
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:43,930
for literally no reason I could have

310
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,930
gotten it in two minutes as our Luck's

311
00:13:50,230 --> 00:14:00,730
right now put it on your plastic shelves

312
00:13:53,140 --> 00:14:02,380
in the freezer the pan this is taking

313
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:04,150
three hours you get a godless desirable

314
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:05,830
trick to manage this is not worth that

315
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:07,690
since I have now been informed that

316
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:10,240
putting this in my freezer would burn a

317
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:13,290
hole through the plastic I am actually

318
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,130
going to leave this on my stove top and

319
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:16,570
holes down into the next 10 minutes

320
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:18,520
because I'm over this video and I have

321
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:19,660
things to do let's finish this drink

322
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:22,090
this looks awful

323
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:25,780
like what this toxin not good the race

324
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:42,850
here was a little wrong let's milk in it

325
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:43,330
oh that is not right Oh kick to chest

326
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:47,170
again

327
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:48,790
okay like there okay that's good we're

328
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:50,350
gonna try this with regular coconut milk

329
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:51,700
instead of unsweetened coconut I don't

330
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:53,110
know who what made that I figured

331
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,620
decision it was not me I'll tell you

332
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:54,970
that right now

333
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:58,030
but maybe this will taste a little bit

334
00:14:54,970 --> 00:15:02,050
oh it's closed better let's see this now

335
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:04,540
oh that's so gross just color I've ever

336
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:06,880
seen this is not right it's purple

337
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:08,800
that's really dark purple last step I'm

338
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,330
going to grab these freeze-dried

339
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:16,930
strawberries it's like strawberry chips

340
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:19,380
can I eat this this would be the good

341
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:19,380
nor fries

342
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:29,420

345
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:45,660
venti pink candy drinking purply purply

346
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:54,120
this video is cancelled how do I get

347
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:57,540
this out of here oh my god girls don't

348
00:15:54,120 --> 00:16:07,320

351
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:14,070

sisters oh my god three hours later we

353
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:17,700
are finally done with our breakfast

354
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:18,930
option for today I had truly thought

355
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:21,090
this is going to be an easy video to

356
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:22,560
film and of course I was wrong

357
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:24,270
I didn't however have a very good time

358
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,330
doing this and the pumpkin bread it

359
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:28,650
looks great the pink drink not so much

360
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:30,450
I think the only way to see how we

361
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:33,330
actually did is with the taste test so

362
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:34,770
I'm ready to dive right in and first one

363
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:36,900
Oh God but just my fort and like a nice

364
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:40,290
little slice of my pumpkin right here

365
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:42,840
Oh we're gonna look same-sex oh my god

366
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:46,350
I'm a professional Baker look at this

367
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:48,710
same beautiful golden a brown color

368
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:52,110
nice dark brown crust on the outside

369
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:53,550
with a good pumpkin seed crunchy texture

370
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:54,510
this is pretty good fresh you would

371
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,770
never even know if I put this in front

372
00:16:54,510 --> 00:17:02,280
of you let's see how to actually compare

373
00:16:55,770 --> 00:17:04,080
as taste wise oh my god that's laughs oh

374
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:07,590
my god

375
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:10,050
oh my god you were good that was such a

376
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:11,790
delicious and hearty piece of bread but

377
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:14,190
all of this chewing has left my throat

378
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:17,280
so dry I think I should maybe wash it

379
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:17,910
all down with a sip of my DIY Do It

380
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,209
Yourself

381
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:23,699
that's what GI right means done

382
00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:39,960
thinkety thinkety that turned out purple

383
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:42,270
oh it doesn't taste like strawberries at

384
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:45,690
all it tastes like fashion tea lemonade

385
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:47,760
but like with milk instead of lemonade

386
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:49,980
which is not good I will tell you right

387
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,690
now I think it's because we use the very

388
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:54,000
very hibiscus refresher instead of the

389
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:55,440
like strawberry one but there was no

390
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,940
strawberry hace refresher to actually

391
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,260
use if they do this on purpose so we

392
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:01,559
cannot actually do this at home that's

393
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:03,299
so disappointing all that work and we

394
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:04,980
get this are you guys I guess this

395
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:07,980
concludes me trying to make my daily

396
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:09,600
Starbucks order at home from scratch let

397
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:12,179
me know what you guys think this pumpkin

398
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,830
bread recipe lochia slaps like ten out

399
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:15,419
of ten would recommend you guys should

400
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:16,740
definitely try this at home it's like a

401
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:18,929
really really good and fresh breakfast

402
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:21,240
item this pink candy drinkin tea however

403
00:18:18,929 --> 00:18:21,929
is not a pink tea drinker tea as a

404
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,730
disgrace

405
00:18:21,929 --> 00:18:25,080
pinkie drinkin tea sweetie I am so sorry

406
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:26,789
I was already suspicious going into this

407
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,590
but all the recipes recommended the

408
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:30,390
passion tea and the very very hibiscus

409
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:31,770
refresher is because I'm an avid at

410
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:33,659
Starbucks fanatic and neither one of

411
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:35,010
those two drinks are even close to the

412
00:18:33,659 --> 00:18:36,330
taste of the pink drink and I was

413
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:38,340
definitely right because this tastes

414
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:39,870
absolutely awful although this is very

415
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:42,630
very far that secretes these things at

416
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:44,039
home today it took me at 3 hours I would

417
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:45,690
much rather run to Starbucks and take

418
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:49,440
five minutes and spend only five dollars

419
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:51,059
and have a far better and faster morning

420
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,289
