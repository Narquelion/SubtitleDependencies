3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,350
videos ago I did a Q&A and one question

4
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:09,330
you guys asked was if there were one

5
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:11,519
youtuber outside of the VT road that you

6
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:13,139
who collab with who would it be and my

7
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,450
answer to that was Shane Dawson and

8
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:18,600
Jenna Marbles and today my dreams came

9
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,830
true kind of there was a really crazy

10
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,480

14
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:28,830
tried to follow a Jeffrey star makeup

15
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,060

16
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:33,180

18
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:38,460
morning I woke up to a million tweets

19
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:41,629

71
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,010
people what is going on

72
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:27,590
same-same okay even though this video

73
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,870
let's take its toll on a toaster oven

74
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:33,610
she looks great so hopefully i'll be

75
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:33,610
able to recreate this on me today

76
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,989
that is literally the team

77
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:46,610
I feel like primer I correct me if I'm

78
00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:48,709
wrong for many of you guys I feel like

79
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:50,290
primer literally does nothing like every

80
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:52,610
time I use a primer if anything it just

81
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:53,930
disrupts the foundation that's actually

82
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:55,340
on my nose that's why I literally

83
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:57,080
stopped using it I only use moisturizer

84
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,400
anymore but I feel like primer is the

85
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:15,200
biggest gimmick in the beauty world like

86
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:16,519
what does it even do oh my god sisters

87
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,970
that we are doing a full coverage

88
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:21,799
vanilla cake mix makeup today good lord

89
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:23,900
that foundation it can cover like

90
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:26,510
anything like that's enough to cover

91
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:28,280
like my scandals I don't have the exact

92
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,930
cream foundation that Jenna uses but I

93
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,669
do you have the Krylon TV paint stick

94
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:33,620
which is equally as full coverage and

95
00:04:31,669 --> 00:04:35,180
also a cream foundation this is

96
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:38,949
literally what I use for drag makeup but

97
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:38,949
I guess we're going to use this today

98
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:47,330
with a brush oh gosh

99
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:48,919

100
00:04:47,330 --> 00:05:00,650

101
00:04:48,919 --> 00:05:02,000

00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:50,060

face right okay let's pause and going

129
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:27,890
right in at the hollows of the cheek

130
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:30,500
bones to really give that sunken and

131
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:32,270
sculpted look I like that she actually

132
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,890
described that that is definitely

133
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:35,900
correct placement and I always do my

134
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:37,220
contour in my cheeks and as well as

135
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,200
around the face as well that really

136
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:41,210
highlights the center of your face which

137
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,040
brings attention to it so good job

138
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,510
sister Jenna that is correct

139
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:49,970

140
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:53,450
level of bronzer please yeah okay thank

do have a Mac blush and peaches

144
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:04,540
hopefully there should be a similar

145
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,540
color

146
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:13,419
so according to like your face shape I

147
00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:18,669
like to blend it in like with my bronzer

148
00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:19,930
a little bit okay me too I think she's

149
00:08:18,669 --> 00:08:22,240
actually doing a really good job of

150
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:24,160
explaining where to place the products

151
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,050
and how much to put on like how to blend

152
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:34,419
it out that's awesome good job sister

153
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:37,330

don't care oh come on I don't care well

156
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:50,620
I'm not even put it based on my eyes cuz

157
00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:53,140
they don't like me everybody I really

158
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:55,270
really like this light brown color race

159
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:57,880
okay so let's say she has a duo palette

160
00:08:55,270 --> 00:09:01,089
of a light light light light light brown

161
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:02,770
and a slightly darker brown let me go

162
00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:04,810
see what I have okay so I just found

163
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:06,160
this covergirl true naked eye shadow

164
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:08,640
palette it basically is like my only

165
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,510
palette that has light tans and browns

166
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,339
if you guys know me you know that I

167
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:14,650
really don't do a lot of soft makeup so

168
00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:15,970

173
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,320
actually explaining why she's picking

174
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,060
he's tell it like she's talking about

175
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,260
how she wants light matte cheeks under

176
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:37,300
her eyelids really bring attention to

177
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:38,170
her eyes I think this is actually a good

178
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,550
tutorial

179
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:41,620

brown with this blending brush which is

182
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:50,270
totally not what you're supposed to use

183
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:55,760

just about right Oh God I'm gonna take

185
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,900
my empire 33 and dip into this light

186
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:02,600
brown shade and my nudes palette and I

187
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:04,250
guess put it all over the eyelid with a

188
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,690
blending brush like genocide this is

189
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:07,490
definitely not the brush that you would

190
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:09,830
normally use for this I wouldn't usually

191
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:12,320
pick something like this a more like a

192
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:14,180
flat rocker brush to really get that

193
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,610
color and they're particularly good that

194
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,900
color on there but you know what we're

195
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:19,100
gonna just use a blending brush for

196
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:22,430
today and like Jenna said we're gonna

197
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:23,690
put it all over I think this is

198
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,980
literally doing nothing because the

199
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:27,050
amount of bronzer have I made peace

200
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:29,450
right no I'm gonna take this darker

201
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:33,830
brown and I'm taking the same brush and

202
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:50,480
then clean it and do it into it knocking

203
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:52,070
up my crease I don't know about the

204
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,650
whole slopping method I can actually do

205
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:57,710
my I kind of throbbing right now that

206
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:59,720
definitely does not feel good I'm gonna

207
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:10,160
stick to my windshield wiper motion but

208
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:12,200
you do use this I looked at all you can

209
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,740
take a q-tip or whatever but I just go

210
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,580
like this

211
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:19,160
oh no want to touch up like your temples

212
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:27,080
now that you've messed them up YouTube

213
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:31,400
but I don't oh you know what I feel like

214
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:33,170
this is a terrible joke video oh that is

215
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,640
just not what you're supposed to do as

216
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:36,020
painful as that was for me to do with as

217
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,870
a beauty guru I am falling of course

218
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:40,490
Jenna's tutorial I do see so many people

219
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:42,200
doing that when it comes to fixing up

220
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:43,760
their eyeshadow a really great technique

221
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,630
you can do if you want to kind of clean

222
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,610
it I'm gonna make it just a little bit

223
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:47,840
more to find easy to grab a little bit

224
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:50,030
of concealer under Beauty Blender and

225
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,530
just go right and it kind of just go up

226
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:53,480
against that edge and really just clean

227
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:55,100
it up doesn't do a great job of kind of

228
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,780
lightening up that area and defining a

229
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:59,060
little bit without ripping up all of

230
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,440
your foundation leaving a red spot was

231
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:02,800
just

232
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,780
spooky and horrible or sometimes if it's

233
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,780
really not looking doc odd you can take

234
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:10,090
a powder puff or your Beautyblender and

235
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:13,150
a little bit of setting powder and just

236
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:14,590
go right under just like that and wipe

237
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:17,170
it off after a little while just like

238
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:19,270
baking normally does and that shuttle

239
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:21,550
will be cleaned up and your foundation

240
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:24,490
will not be disrupted and completely

241
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:28,450
gone like it is here poeple hunt I'm a

242
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:30,130
big fan of gel liners this brush just

243
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:31,000
came with it you can use any kind of a

244
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:34,830
liner brush

245
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,830
I'm a fan I'm gonna put this right

246
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:39,160
before I even start doing this I notice

247
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,360
Jenna is talking at her land to get it

248
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,190
straight across while looking down at

249
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,540
her mirror to try on her liner this is

250
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:44,980
something that is really really common

251
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:47,410
for people to do as well but this is

252
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:49,420
actually a really really bad technique

253
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:51,700
this thing that can cause really really

254
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:54,220
bad eye wrinkles which obviously none of

255
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:55,660
us want ever gonna do a gel liner and

256
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,490
you're having trouble getting it really

257
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:59,680
really even I would recommend getting a

258
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:00,970
compact mirror like this and instead of

259
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,100
kind of like looking at your mirror and

260
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:05,050
trying to get it straight hold your

261
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:07,330
mirror at a downward angle like this and

262
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:08,920
hold your brush upwards that'll give you

263
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:10,120
a really easy access to your eyelid so

264
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,430
you have the whole thing to look at

265
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:14,470
without having to stretch it which shows

266
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:21,700
bottom a long run right here in the

267
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:24,670
corner oh okay was it like this okay so

268
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,990
we're doing a wing I guess as well and

269
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:28,120
Jenna is definitely right and that when

270
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:29,200
you draw an eyeliner weighing it you

271
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,690
definitely want to follow the natural

272
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,250
shape of your eye and Jen it is true a

273
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:40,150
baby weighing today so it's the same

274
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:41,710
thing that we are going to do if I turn

275
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:43,990
to the side this is basically hide our

276
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:45,460
winged eyeliner should look as you can

277
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:47,860
see it goes right from the bottom and it

278
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:49,180
follows my eye right up at the shape and

279
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,160
just comes right up into a nice point

280
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:52,839
and goes right back in to that liner

281
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,910
which is really really flattering for my

282
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:57,370
eye shape way too many people draw their

283
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:59,430
winged eyeliner going right up like that

284
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:03,550
that I let her shape is flattering on

285
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:06,610

as a job for a living every single day

295
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:40,850
I still struggle with putting on

296
00:14:39,589 --> 00:14:42,560
eyelashes and it's one of the hardest

297
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:43,940
parts of makeup and she's just gonna

298
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,459
throw it on there

299
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:50,350

eyelashes about a mascara to blend them

whoo I can roll the best

318
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:22,120
okay I think that's a Maybelline mascara

319
00:16:18,339 --> 00:16:23,710
but this is filmed in 2011 so I don't

320
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,570
even know if that's being unsold anymore

321
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:29,140
I'm gonna use the Maybelline Big Shot

322
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:31,150
mascara which is being sold and it's

323
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:33,070
good not only do I want to teach Jenna

324
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:34,620
how to do makeup but I also need to

325
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:53,080
teach her how to do a ton pop

326
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:54,339
desperately so once again there's

327
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:56,260
getting a helpful hint when you use

328
00:16:54,339 --> 00:16:58,810
block file it often gives you like a

329
00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:00,760
sultry sexy look but it does make your

330
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:02,560
eyes look much smaller I like to use a

331
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,970
white like Jenna said make sure I soak

332
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,920
really really big dress attention to

333
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:22,150
them and gives you like a doll like look

334
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:23,319
but God Paul John today makeup is very

335
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:25,179
very expensive but you can definitely

336
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:28,800
find it cheaper options that is Four

339
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:44,620
we're not doing web sick oh so I

340
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:46,120
described the mac lipglass

341
00:17:44,620 --> 00:18:05,850
in the shade it pleased me this is the

342
00:17:46,120 --> 00:18:08,950
lightest pink I could find so that's it

343
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:11,950
wait a second where's the highlighter or

344
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:13,780
has a setting spray where's the setting

345
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:16,780
powder sister

346
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:21,400
okay sisters I guess we are done here

347
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:22,960
and this is the completed look for today

348
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,100
looking at this draw beauty guru

349
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,900
standpoint if someone who does makeup

350
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:27,370
every single day I definitely have

351
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:29,170
products and techniques that I like to

352
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:31,300
use and definitely would have loved to

353
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:32,410
see added to this tutorial but the whole

354
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,730
point of this video is obviously to

355
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:35,410
throw all my makeup knowledge out the

356
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:36,940
window and kind of look at this as an

357
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:38,350
outsider trying to follow a YouTube

358
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:40,150
tutorial just like all of you sisters

359
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:42,940
out there I really don't think this

360
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:44,320
looks that bad and throughout Jenna's

361
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:46,420
video I actually feel like she did a

362
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,700
really really great job of explaining

363
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:49,840
every single step she was doing so

364
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,430
everyone could kind of get it no matter

365
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,530
what their skill level really wise

366
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:55,810
Jenna's video actually included a lot of

367
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:57,700
really really great tips that beauty

368
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:59,650
gurus tend to skip over but that would

369
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:01,600
be super helpful to any beginner makeup

370
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:03,160
wear such as using a different brush for

371
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,020
bronzing and contouring know what

372
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,700
they're not the same thing using your

373
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:08,470
natural eye shape as a guide for drawing

374
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:11,140
your winged liner one of the best tricks

375
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:12,700
I'd ever learned using mascara to blend

376
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:15,010
together your falsies with your regular

377
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:16,770
lashes and of course the pros and cons

378
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:19,150
of using black and white eyeliner

379
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:20,680
overall I had so much fun following a

380
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:22,360
jenna Marbles makeup tutorial today I

381
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,710
know how crazy she can be in her video

382
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,420
sometimes but I think it was really

383
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:26,830
really cool to see this more chill side

384
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:28,690
of Jenna just relaxing

385
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:31,060
