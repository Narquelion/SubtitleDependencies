00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,470
hi sisters team Charles here and welcome

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,910
back 20 YouTube channel you guys I am so

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,649
good excited because today we are

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:09,929
finally back in business with a

5
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:12,660
regularly scheduled and makeup video and

6
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:14,040
I am so beyond pump but also low-key not

7
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,839
like nervous but I just like don't know

8
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,109
how this video is going to go so like

9
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,850
I'm skeptical right now there is a huge

10
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:22,949
and I think really really funny trend

11
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,630
going on youtuber basically people are

12
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:26,250
going to different fast food restaurants

13
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,920
and letting the car in front of them

14
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,090
decide their order you can basically end

15
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,660
up with like a four-piece happy meal

16
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,989
from McDonald's

17
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:37,170
or like 18 different Doritos Locos Tacos

18
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:38,850
Grande chicken chalupas talked about and

19
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,379
you have no idea what your actual wheel

20
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,540
is gonna be until you get to the final

21
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:43,890
window which is literally so crazy I

22
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,090
figured it'd be so much fun to try to

23
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,579
figure out how to kind of it turn this

24
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,570
concept into a makeup video now I do

25
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:50,610
want to give credit to all my favorite

26
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:52,140
creators taught right now me up maples

27
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,879
she did someone think a few weeks ago

28
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,899
and her buddy was so much fun to watch I

29
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:56,219
will leave a link down below if you guys

30
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:58,289
want to check it out but I want to do

31
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:00,719
some one thing today so basically we're

32
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:03,809
going to head to Ulta and let the people

33
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,110
in front of me in line pick my makeup

34
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:05,610
routine

35
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,780
now obviously Ulta does not have like a

36
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,950
drive-through window where I can just

37
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,220
pull up and be like I'll take whatever

38
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:13,890
they're having although that is a good

39
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:16,049
idea to send me an email of how fat and

40
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,369
also most people tend to not go in and

41
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:18,960
spend like a thousand dollars on a full

42
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:21,060
Fraser sheen at one time out there on a

43
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,560
sister shopping spree go off girl like

44
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,750
more power to you risk factor 100

45
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,009
percent if that happened to happen today

46
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,840
I was able to get behind them in line

47
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:29,759
that make this video a whole lot easier

48
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,740
but the chances of that are very very

49
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,299
slim so what I think I want to do is go

50
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,009
into Ulta and I hide away a little bit

51
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:37,560
and wait until there's a few people in

52
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:42,240
line in front of me and then hop in and

53
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:43,380
say I want all of that this might not

54
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,640
work as well as I thought it was going

55
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,500
to know now that I'm saying it out loud

56
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,180
but you know what we're gonna try and

57
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,710

59
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,740

time to know because there were so many

87
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:45,439
people in line and they all had lots of

88
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,519
items and bits and bobs which is good

89
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:47,840

90
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:49,010
challenge where we go to the triumph

if I should use my own brushes or not so

103
00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:19,090

the board this way though to make this

191
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:54,030

products before but I've heard that

211
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:34,020
they're really really good this color

212
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,729
does not look like it's even close to a

213
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:40,050
right match but I really really want to

214
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:46,080

let's look at the shade for this too

233
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:30,020
you know I'm just glad to see the fact

234
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,910
that Ulta has lots of different shape

235
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:33,800
variations at this point so you have an

236
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:36,230
elf blending brush you have the next

237
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:38,030
bear with me hydrating a jelly primer

238
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:39,170

00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:42,500
roller lash used to be my all-time

240
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:43,940
favorite mascara Oh champagne mom okay I

241
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,680

242
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:47,990
no we've had no highlighter yeah okay

243
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,180
okay this is a perfect another option oh

244
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:52,400
the rock alter-ego lipstick I Milani lip

245
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:53,960
stick and elf ultimate foundation brush

246
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,170
okay this is good and that's the not

247
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:58,970
least you have an Anasazi eyebrow

248
00:09:56,170 --> 00:10:00,230
definer okay I usually use the brow is

249
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:02,270
but this can work too

250
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:03,950
in the shade medium brown okay good

251
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:05,870
that's my color all right you guys well

252
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:08,990
I feel like this is a very random but

253
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:10,400
also a very very successful makeup haul

254
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:11,900
I'm pretty sure we have every single

255
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,610
step of our makeup routine covered in

256
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:15,080
front of us and definitely paid off to

257
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:17,150
wait for the store to get really busy

258
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,050
and wait in line I had it so much fun up

259
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:20,840
meeting everybody in the store today

260
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:21,980
that they're all so so so sweet and they

261
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,360
also did a really good job picking up

262
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:25,130
making our products so I'm gonna go and

263
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,780
unbox my favorites and then let's get

264
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:30,130
started it with a fondant makeup look

265
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:30,130
all right you guys I'm gonna get started

266
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:35,270
okay I'm gonna get started to use anyway

267
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:37,460
Aveeno ultra common daily moisturizer

268
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:38,600
that includes a sunscreen your skin care

269
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,340
should always have sunscreen in it

270
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,710
that's good okay so for foundation today

271
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:44,300
I'm not exactly sure let's just try our

272
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:46,760
options okay so we have the Maybelline

273
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:49,220
Dream cover see what this color looks

274
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:51,050
like okay not too bad honestly at all

275
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:52,910
we haven't born this way my all-time

276
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:54,200
favorite foundation in the club worm

277
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:55,940
beige which may already know

278
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:59,300
unfortunately for me is not my color

279
00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:02,210
definitely not it we have a makeup

280
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:05,210
revolution in f10 and make a revolution

281
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:06,230
in F this day is day for the books and I

282
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:08,360
need everybody to pay attention right

283
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:09,920
now because my foundation is not going

284
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:12,290
to match in this video just like every

285
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,720
video but this time it's not my fault so

286
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:16,130
I think I'm going to mix together the

287
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,140
makeup revolution

288
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:19,820
shade 10 which is definitely too dark

289
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:21,620
and some of the Maybelline one and see

290
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:23,270
if we can get a good mix I like put this

291
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:25,520
one around like kinda like the edges of

292
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:27,080
my face and cover up this awful breakout

293
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,820
and then I used two Maybelline why not

294
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,830
more towards like the middle of my face

295
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:32,780
this isn't that bad like it's it's not a

296
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:34,160
match but I've had worse let's be real

297
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:36,500
I've dressed a little bit of the

298
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,540
Maybelline - and to like the lighter

299
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:41,089
areas we're gonna use our it cosmetics a

300
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:42,529
full coverage complexion brush to blend

301
00:11:41,089 --> 00:11:44,750
this in okay that color isn't that bad

302
00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:47,990
oh my god yes let's mix together our

303
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:49,790
darker shade some cream contour let's go

304
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:51,230
ahead and blend that and it using our at

305
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:53,509
Beauty Blender now for concealer I'm

306
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:54,829
gonna grab the shade c9 also from what

307
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:56,720
makeup revolution I have associated

308
00:11:54,829 --> 00:11:58,339
Travis concealers today I've heard such

309
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,769
great things about it I'm just going to

310
00:11:58,339 --> 00:12:02,360
pop this and all of the same normal

311
00:12:00,769 --> 00:12:03,889
areas I'm just gonna go ahead and blend

312
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,660
that in as well okay I'm kind of liking

313
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:07,449
how this is looking a lot I definitely

314
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:10,100
feel like I'm missing a little bit of

315
00:12:07,449 --> 00:12:11,480
coverage I was gonna have a tiny little

316
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,860
bit of the shape taping out this just

317
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,350
right underneath my eyes just for a

318
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:16,939
little bit more lightness and coverage

319
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:18,920
but that's that I promise let's grab the

320
00:12:16,939 --> 00:12:20,720
next can't stop won't stop setting

321
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,399
powder and lock this in place this is

322
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,139
actually the only setting powder out of

323
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,370
all of those makeup bags so hopefully

324
00:12:24,139 --> 00:12:26,899
they strokes out because we don't have

325
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,879
another option this powder looks a

326
00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:30,170
little bit dark oh we're just gonna push

327
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:31,610
this on there and then we're gonna wipe

328
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:32,959
it off hopefully this comes off

329
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:35,060
translucent because this is looking a

330
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,769
little bit not correct so squeeze our

331
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:39,170
other elephant foundation brush to wipe

332
00:12:36,769 --> 00:12:40,519
away the excess it's like shiny a little

333
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:43,250
bit for some reason which I feel like a

334
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:50,060
setting powder should not be at all

335
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:51,829
oh okay I've liked everything that I've

336
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:54,110
tried so far except for the setting

337
00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:55,189
powder I do not like it at all looks

338
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:56,389
like I have white foundation there's

339
00:12:55,189 --> 00:12:58,610
stuff but it's completely set down and

340
00:12:56,389 --> 00:13:01,459
dry I did not like that would not use it

341
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:03,350
guys now we have to contour we don't

342
00:13:01,459 --> 00:13:04,490
really have anything from let's look let

343
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,899
me check out the Adelaide more

344
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:08,420
importance of a contour suite of that

345
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:10,370
and has a color called contour I can't

346
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:12,139
put that on my cheek well I'm gonna grab

347
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:14,120
a little bit of I feel beautiful which

348
00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:15,500
is deep blush color on that foundation

349
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,630
brush and let's use that at least to

350
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,980
apply a little bit of a blush that's

351
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,089
definitely our very pretty color I guess

352
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:21,800
I have to literally use a fluffy

353
00:13:20,089 --> 00:13:23,120
eyeshadow brush to contour today I

354
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,130
wonder if there's a color in the actual

355
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,019
Anasazi part let's see yes okay we're

356
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:28,189
gonna go the shade h OE from the Alyssa

357
00:13:27,019 --> 00:13:30,050
Edwards on a salty palate and we're

358
00:13:28,189 --> 00:13:31,160
gonna use a little bit of this color to

359
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:32,809
contour I'm gonna be careful because

360
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,639
this is definitely a dark shade and I

361
00:13:32,809 --> 00:13:36,410
don't want to go too intense I'm gonna

362
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,480
grab that alpha blending brush that we

363
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:41,360
got in one of the bags and grab that

364
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,610
same h OE color and use this too

365
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,230
Torinos I am happy with this so far so

366
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:46,879
normally right about now I would bake my

367
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:49,399
face to lock everything and please and

368
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:50,989
also brighten up the center but consider

369
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:52,459
that setting powder literally is sucked

370
00:13:50,989 --> 00:13:53,689
I don't really want to put more of it on

371
00:13:52,459 --> 00:13:55,249
so I guess where it's kind of stuck with

372
00:13:53,689 --> 00:13:57,139
this so I'm just gonna go right into it

373
00:13:55,249 --> 00:13:58,429
the brows they God we have the Anasazi

374
00:13:57,139 --> 00:14:00,199
broad to find her I don't use this one

375
00:13:58,429 --> 00:14:01,759
too often but Anasazi illiterate makes

376
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:02,929
the best brow product so I'm gonna go

377
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:04,189
ahead and do this quickly off care and

378
00:14:02,929 --> 00:14:05,509
I'll be right back to start off the

379
00:14:04,189 --> 00:14:07,189
ominous already knows we were back in

380
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:08,689
both eyebrows are now complete I'm not

381
00:14:07,189 --> 00:14:10,009
exactly having the best I brought a at

382
00:14:08,689 --> 00:14:12,290
this one turned out really good at this

383
00:14:10,009 --> 00:14:13,519
one not so much but you know what we

384
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:15,079
have phase tuned for reason I'm gonna

385
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,149
grab the Anasazi Beverly Hills acts

386
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:19,129
Alyssa Edwards palette I am so excited

387
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:20,959
about this one today I already have my

388
00:14:19,129 --> 00:14:22,639
eyes primed with some makeup revolution

389
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:25,249
concealer what I'm just gonna grab a

390
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,569
little bit more so it's nice and tacky I

391
00:14:25,249 --> 00:14:27,889
really want to use the yellow and the

392
00:14:26,569 --> 00:14:28,999
pink and the blue and the purple and I

393
00:14:27,889 --> 00:14:30,649
could literally just do a yellow pink

394
00:14:28,999 --> 00:14:32,869
purple blue let's try it

395
00:14:30,649 --> 00:14:34,850
president JH 33 brush on the shaded

396
00:14:32,869 --> 00:14:38,209
dreamer I'm gonna pack this on the outer

397
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:40,670
like the type area oh wow that's pick

398
00:14:38,209 --> 00:14:42,199
attentive love that just gonna lightly

399
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:45,110
go over the edge of that and kind of

400
00:14:42,199 --> 00:14:46,639
blend the color out next with that same

401
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:48,589
brush since I really don't have any

402
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,360
other options I'm gonna grab believe

403
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:52,610
which is the kind of lighter purple

404
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,980
color and put this right over top and

405
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:56,059
next to dot blue this purple is

406
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:59,239
definitely blending out really really

407
00:14:56,059 --> 00:15:00,649
well to it not perfect but purple is by

408
00:14:59,239 --> 00:15:02,480
far the hardest shade to formulate when

409
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:03,619
it comes to eyeshadows I would know

410
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,360
because we literally went through the

411
00:15:03,619 --> 00:15:07,040
800 million different lab samples of a

412
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,749
single and escaped until we got one that

413
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:12,350
we were happy with that looks good okay

414
00:15:08,749 --> 00:15:15,169
next I'm gonna grab the JH 32 brush and

415
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:17,059
dip into a Texas made the bright pink

416
00:15:15,169 --> 00:15:19,850
shade and I'm gonna put this right next

417
00:15:17,059 --> 00:15:20,959
to believe same exact techniques just

418
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:21,410
having the color on there and then

419
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,720
lightly

420
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:26,899
buffing them together to blend it out

421
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:29,329
let's grab the JH 42 brush and the color

422
00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:31,699
brick road which is deep bright yellow

423
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:34,910
I'm gonna pop this on the inner corner

424
00:15:31,699 --> 00:15:36,529
wow that is a bright yellow oh wow

425
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:37,910
I was literally one dip in the pan too

426
00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:40,400
and it created all of that pigment that

427
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:43,250
is so crazy I'm gonna try to

428
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:45,529
do that yellow and pink to create that

429
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,940
orange color that we want I'm just gonna

430
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:49,580
go ahead and repeat those same steps on

431
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:51,589
the bottom lash line okay nice nautical

432
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:54,980
djh of 43 brush and dip into the shade

433
00:15:51,589 --> 00:15:57,020
boost and draw out a little bit of a lip

434
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:58,910
blocked lighter wow that looks actually

435
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:00,589
really good I'm super happy with that

436
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:02,330
and lost the finally not least on my

437
00:16:00,589 --> 00:16:04,970
edge age 39 brush I'm just gonna dip

438
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:07,040
into a headliner the bright white and

439
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:12,410
put a little bit of this in the inner

440
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:13,790
corner just to a little bit already base

441
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:16,010
that's pretty much the eye shadow of one

442
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:17,870
eye all complete I am obsessed with

443
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:20,210
these colors and this ombre pattern it

444
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:21,260
looks so so good at the blending could

445
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:22,190
be a little bit better but it's

446
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,390
definitely my own fault

447
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,950
I have not done a colorful makeup look

448
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:27,050
and literally weeks at this point so I'm

449
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:28,610
a little bit rusty not being said

450
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:29,600
practice does make perfect so I'm gonna

451
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:31,070
go and do the other eye off-camera

452
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,960
quickly and I'll be right back to finish

453
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:34,430
off the rest of the look already guys

454
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,170
you're back bold eyes are complete I

455
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:37,640
literally love this look so much I think

456
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:40,490
it looks so it's very much like a

457
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:42,320
butterfly ask which I'm so down for

458
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:47,390
alright now that we have a bolt eyes on

459
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:48,650
Khurana run oh God I'm angry now that

460
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:51,230
both eyes are now complete I'm gonna

461
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:53,720
grab the benefit roller lash color

462
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:56,480
mascara and apply a light coat of this

463
00:16:53,720 --> 00:17:00,529
to my lashes and then I'd like to think

464
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:03,170
that only God for giving me my early

465
00:17:00,529 --> 00:17:04,640
lashes my Lily lashes use comb James for

466
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:06,110
15% off your order

467
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,309
these are my all-time favorite lashes in

468
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:08,750
the entire world I had no I wear these

469
00:17:07,309 --> 00:17:11,800
every single makeup look but you know

470
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,800
what we're gonna put them on

471
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:16,040
all right you guys moving right along

472
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:17,689
the next step of our makeup routine is

473
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,550
going to be of course the highlighter

474
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:21,980
and for that I'm going to grab that gosh

475
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:24,260
champagne pop shimmering skin perfecter

476
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:26,270
it has been a hot minute since I used

477
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:28,100
this highlighter I remember it not

478
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:30,679
exactly working that well for my skin

479
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:32,480
tone so we're gonna find that out I

480
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:33,440
guess looks so pretty

481
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,700
why don't I think this didn't work for

482
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:39,770
my skin tone at one point you're

483
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:41,450
literally going we're gonna grab the JH

484
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:43,040
39 once again that same clothes that I

485
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:44,870
used to put the white and my inner

486
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:47,270
corners and we're gonna grab some more

487
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:48,950
champagne pop on this and use this for

488
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:50,570
my nose highlight gonna probably tide a

489
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:51,950
little bit in the inner corner as well

490
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,870
all right guys we're pretty much already

491
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:55,580
at the end all we have left now is lips

492
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:58,910
and we have quite a lot of options we

493
00:17:55,580 --> 00:18:00,200
have the lorac Pro in CEO that will be a

494
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:02,360
good color with this lock okay

495
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:04,640
she's definitely a contender anasazi a

496
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:06,050
spice that is such a pretty color but I

497
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,640
feel like it's a little bit too like

498
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:10,250
orange II for this particular type of

499
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,300
look Anasazi uh yes I liked its color a

500
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:13,580
lot but I don't really want to do a

501
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:15,440
lipstick without a lip liner and I don't

502
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:17,840
actually think we have one of those we

503
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,240
have Kylie velvet liquid lipstick so not

504
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,190
a full matte in the color surprised me

505
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,900
yeah this would work with this look but

506
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:25,400
I don't know if I want a bright pink we

507
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:27,770
have another Kylie that this one is a

508
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,059
velvet in the shade of commando that's

509
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:31,370
very similar to the Anasazi one though

510
00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:36,590
that I didn't love oh so how about some

511
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:44,179
in the color Tanya this one is going to

512
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:48,500
be a no I hate that

513
00:18:44,179 --> 00:18:50,929
that is what my fellow choice actually

514
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:52,550
I'm gonna do a little combination I'm

515
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:54,620
gonna start off with the lorac pro one

516
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:56,330
in the color CEO because it's a little

517
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:58,040
bit of like a darker mob and then I'm

518
00:18:56,330 --> 00:19:02,140
gonna go to the Anasazi a kiss in the

519
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:02,140
middle for a nice ombre lip

520
00:19:04,259 --> 00:19:11,289
okay a little bit and last but finally

521
00:19:09,009 --> 00:19:13,779
not least one less print of the Urban

522
00:19:11,289 --> 00:19:15,580
Decay all nighter setting spray just

523
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:16,090
talked this beautiful makeup looking

524
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,409
place

525
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:18,850
alright you guys and I think that is the

526
00:19:17,409 --> 00:19:20,889
finished makeup look all complete

527
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:23,080
decided completely by the people in

528
00:19:20,889 --> 00:19:25,419
front of me in line at the makeup store

529
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,889
I had it so much fun at them in this

530
00:19:25,419 --> 00:19:28,120
challenge today and at more than

531
00:19:26,889 --> 00:19:30,399
anything obviously I love how those look

532
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:32,110
turned out but this was a such a fun

533
00:19:30,399 --> 00:19:33,490
opportunity to just try out so many

534
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:35,259
brand-new products that have literally

535
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:37,059
no sight and what was like coming my way

536
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:38,289
I think there were so many things here

537
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:40,000
that I would never have actually picked

538
00:19:38,289 --> 00:19:41,139
up myself but I really really love how

539
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,299
this look turned out and I really hope

540
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:44,679
you guys did as well I do want to say a

541
00:19:43,299 --> 00:19:46,120
quick thank you to all tough roads being

542
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:47,919
it literally the best and letting me

543
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,269
