safe holiday season

8
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:18,930
personally I spent my night doing

9
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,609
absolutely nothing which was incredible

10
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,920
wouldn't change anything ten out of ten

11
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:24,060
would recommend I played Mario Kart did

12
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,560
a few different makeup look hung out

13
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,449

00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:30,060

16
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,070
because I'm just only not in my life

17
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,960
right now but twenty twenty so far has

18
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:35,070

25
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:46,350
we have coming for 2020 I thought it'd

26
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,789
be really really fun to just sit down

27
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,960
together do a little bit of a chit chat

28
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:50,160

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,719

notice the new graphics on the channel

47
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,829
control I am literally obsessive how

48
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,479
they turned out I thought it'd be really

49
00:01:24,829 --> 00:01:28,009
fun to go into 20/20 with a few new

50
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,390
things on it - the videos they get to my

51
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:30,890
good friend of Michael who designed it

52
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:32,539

53
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,649
literally so talented make sure you guys

55
00:01:33,649 --> 00:01:37,789
comment down below if you notice

56
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:38,899
anything else okay time to jump in so

57
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:40,250
one of my favorite things that I did

58
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:43,490
over the holiday break was getting a

59
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:45,200
tattoo a face tattoo okay no I did not

60
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:46,729
get anything crazy I know I uploaded one

61
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,560
at robbing my makeup routine but I'm not

62
00:01:46,729 --> 00:01:50,119
a soundcloud rapper just yeah I want

63
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,039
obviously keep you guys posted my

64
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:54,049
sisters but I did get my eyebrows a

65
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:56,060
microplane and spoiler alert I am

66
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:57,170
obsessed with the result I'm gonna tell

67
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:59,720
you guys about it while I go ahead and

68
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:01,610
conceal my brows which is now the first

69
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,049
type of a makeup routine I know there's

70
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:04,250
video footage of me out there saying

71
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:05,599
that I would never do my eyebrows first

72
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,799
I just really like to have my full base

73
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:08,030
on and then put the eyebrows overtop

74
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,959
because I feel like it's so hard to just

75
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,489
carve them out and just get everything

76
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,900
but after trying this technique out and

77
00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:13,190
my celebrity makeup hacks video and

78
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,569
getting them done I will honestly say

79
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:16,040
this is like the best decision that I've

80
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:17,840
ever made a my makeup routine that now

81
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,459
takes me at like literally 30 minutes

82
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,660
lasts and I am obsessed with how they

83
00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:22,579
turned out I came across this micro

84
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:24,380
bleeding artist by the name of brown jam

85
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:25,639
and I was so shocked by her work because

86
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:27,170
it was much different than like the

87
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:28,670
typical kind of like chainin and a

88
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:30,680
blocky and micro bleeding that a lot of

89
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:32,420
people kind of had when it first became

90
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,340
like a thing and it was very focused I'm

91
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:36,109
just like tiny little thin hair strokes

92
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:37,280
I was so good and I was so shocked by it

93
00:02:36,109 --> 00:02:38,450
that I literally commented on her post

94
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,010
and was like this is the best microbe

95
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:41,239
winning that I've ever seen I didn't

96
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:42,680
think anything of it and I just went to

97
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:44,239
bed but the next morning I woke up and

98
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,880
check my Instagram Deion's and she

99
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,889
actually me and her name was Jeanne but

100
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,940
she was living in Scotland and I was

101
00:02:48,889 --> 00:02:50,900
talking to her about micro bleeding and

102
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,190
she's like oh my god I would love to do

103
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,720
your brows one day and I was like yeah

104
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,859
I'll let you know if I'm ever overseas

105
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,359
and she's like oh I will literally come

106
00:02:54,859 --> 00:02:58,489
to LA and do them for you if you want I

107
00:02:56,359 --> 00:02:59,660
was like oh my god no way like I'd kind

108
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:00,739
of be down low key and she's literally

109
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,269
like okay let me know I'll book a flight

110
00:03:00,739 --> 00:03:06,019
like now and I was like okay kind of

111
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:06,980
down and then she was here so long story

112
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,900
short Janine

113
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:10,340
flew all the way here from a Scotland -

114
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:12,470
micro blade my eyebrows and I am

115
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:14,359
obsessed with the results she did

116
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:15,380
literally the best job guru Sai brows

117
00:03:14,359 --> 00:03:18,530
look amazing as well

118
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:19,579
she's oops I'm gonna leave Janine's

119
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:21,110
links down below

120
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:22,459
none of the eyebrows are all outlined

121
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,360
and blended out I know it looks a little

122
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:23,850
bit crazy right now

123
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,990
this

124
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:26,670
like look right I was literally the

125
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:28,500
reasoning for me not wanting to do this

126
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:30,660
step beforehand but I now realized that

127
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,250
it is way easier to clean up later on so

128
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,840
if you're watching this and you two are

129
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,310
an eye brows before foundation hater

130
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,170
like I was just bear with me because

131
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:38,310
it'll come together later on and who

132
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:40,230
knows maybe you'll change your routine

133
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:42,570
as well because I'm loving this anyway

134
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:43,410
okay while that concealer is drying down

135
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,700
a little bit I'm just gonna grab a

136
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:46,260
little bit of the dragon Beauty color

137
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,210
corrector just like always and put this

138
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,590
on my beard area this step has not

139
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:51,210
changed I still want to cover up my

140
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:52,980
beard and five o'clock shadow such as I

141
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:54,330
possibly can so now while this is right

142
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,980
now I'm gonna go ahead and do my skin

143
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:57,630
private before foundation someone's

144
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:59,550
gonna got my touch-up water cream and a

145
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:01,980
little fluffy brush I'm just going to

146
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:04,770
brush this on my skin and I'm actually

147
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:06,570
going to avoid my nose area because my

148
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:08,070
nose gets really really oily and I've

149
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:09,630
noticed that not moisturizing it

150
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:11,550
honestly helps the foundation stay a

151
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:13,290
little bit better and then with the

152
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:14,880
touch s self canvas primer I'm just

153
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:17,790
gonna grab a flat foundation brush this

154
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:19,350
is the morphe M at 7:07 hues good things

155
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:21,239
for 10% off I'm just going to grab a

156
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:24,090
little bit of this and applied this area

157
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:25,860
to my central cheek area kind of which

158
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:27,330
is where I have like a bigger pores to

159
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,860
fill this in and smooth this out and

160
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:29,820
then finally I know this is very

161
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,290
dramatic but like I said has been

162
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,820
working well for me recently I'm gonna

163
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:34,710
grab the event a beauty troop matte

164
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,660
primer and put a little bit of this onto

165
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:39,960
my finger and I'm just going to apply

166
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:41,490
this primer to my nose to keep it true

167
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,970
matte like it says in the name and

168
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,070
that's it

169
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:45,660
alright now that all that prep work is

170
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:47,250
done and out of the way we are finally

171
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,870
ready to learn to foundation and for

172
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,460
today I'm gonna using a brand new one

173
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:52,530
and that is the Dior Eric lash

174
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,880
foundation now I honestly have no clue

175
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:55,740
why I didn't pick this up until recently

176
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:58,050
but I'm very fresh to do myself that I

177
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:00,060
did it because the formula is so bomb

178
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:02,580
and also what the undertones are like

179
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:04,260
perfect the shade is 1n and literally

180
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:06,600
okay like you're looking so good this is

181
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:11,970
for my face ready for this no I ain't

182
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:13,920
ready for this okay ready literally by

183
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:16,650
skin tone that's literally my skin tone

184
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:21,990
oh my god we have essentially found the

185
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:23,070
color that is for me like this is 2020

186
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,780
is gonna be my year I'm matching

187
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:26,580
foundation I'm actually just gonna spray

188
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:28,620
this on the back of my assisters easier

189
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:31,200
so I can dip into it like a palette

190
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:33,000
because the fumes are slightly toxic

191
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,460
what not talks like to please don't sue

192
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,030
me

193
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:38,530
good to breathe it all so I'm just

194
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:39,039
putting this into my skin using the Juno

195
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,690
and kala

196
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:43,360
microfiber sponge and it's like this

197
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:44,620
like weird fuzzy type of a sponge but it

198
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,599
does such a good job of blending the

199
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,949
foundation into at my skin all right now

200
00:05:46,599 --> 00:05:49,479
that we have the base all on moving on

201
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:50,860
to concealer nothing has changed

202
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:52,599
so I'm gonna grab my tart shape tape and

203
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:53,800
this one is in the shade light okay so

204
00:05:52,599 --> 00:05:55,930
while glad it's all together I thought

205
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,580
it'd be kind of fun to do a quick 2019

206
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:59,470
recap and when I say quick I do mean

207
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:00,759
quick okay choose a 19 was a mess but

208
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:02,440
there were some amazing things that we

209
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:03,910
did in this past year so let's talk

210
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,639
about them so starting off the year in

211
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:08,590
January my first days of 2019 were

212
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,150
actually spent in a Tennessee way that

213
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:11,470
the Cimorelli girls we got to spend New

214
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:13,060
Year's together and then we recorded the

215
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:14,860
never enough cover that is now the

216
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:16,780
second most viewed video on my channel

217
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:19,120
of all time which is so wild to think

218
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:20,560
about I love those girls so so so much

219
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,690
and I got to see them a few times to

220
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,280
2019 which is actually amazing and then

221
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:25,960
later on in the month of January I went

222
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,240
to the UK for the first time ever which

223
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,889
was so much fun I'm going to the UK was

224
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,120
on my bucket list for literally so long

225
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,860
and we were finally able to make it

226
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,659
happen I got a chance to open up the

227
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:36,159
morphe store in the bullring mall and

228
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:37,330
I'm Birmingham and it was one of the

229
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:40,479
best days of my entire life

230
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:42,610
over 10,000 sister showed up for the

231
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,780
meeting greet it was insane and then we

232
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,490
had February which I feel like was a

233
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:46,840
really really good month of YouTube

234
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,949
content we had a lot of really good

235
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,349
clubs and interview with jenna Marbles

236
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:51,729
the flog squad one also the house tour

237
00:06:50,349 --> 00:06:53,050
with mr. King which was one of my

238
00:06:51,729 --> 00:06:55,030
favorite products that I've ever worked

239
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:57,070
on we also had the Valentine's Day a

240
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:59,139
single look which of course segue to

241
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:01,449
2020 single unfortunately for me but who

242
00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:03,909
knows and then I also attended the Bratz

243
00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:05,349
challenge in 2019 which was my favorite

244
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:06,460
YouTube challenges probably ever the

245
00:07:05,349 --> 00:07:08,440
makeup books that came out of that were

246
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,729
crazy while we talk about March I'm just

247
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,960
going to skip my face using the laura

248
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:12,639
mercier translucent setting powder

249
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,289
marked was actually another really

250
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,099
amazing month when it came to a content

251
00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:16,900
on the channel

252
00:07:15,099 --> 00:07:18,909
I got to put my linguistic skills to the

253
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:20,949
test for the makeup tutorial in espanol

254
00:07:18,909 --> 00:07:22,750
which was so much fun and we actually

255
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:24,639
found out a few weeks ago in the YouTube

256
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:27,159
rewind that that video was the number

257
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,659
one most liked beauty video of 2019

258
00:07:27,159 --> 00:07:29,949
which is ridiculous to think about

259
00:07:28,659 --> 00:07:31,419
considering the amount of beauty content

260
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,979
that was released this year by -

261
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:34,240
nonetheless I am so grateful for and I'm

262
00:07:32,979 --> 00:07:35,710
still though that you guys loved it to

263
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,960
contour gonna grab my Anasazi contour

264
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:39,190
palette and Maya morphe m 405 brush to

265
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,670
chisel out my face while I talk about

266
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,740
the

267
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:42,910
month which is April we started off the

268
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:45,100
month by doing something actually I'm

269
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:46,840
really fond up with the fenomena Buick

270
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,280
Fashion Show that is paired with one of

271
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,720
the designers from the Fidelma program

272
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,400
anyway we have custom up and I got to

273
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,990
walk down the runway which was such a

274
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,880
cool experience one I got to learn a lot

275
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:56,380
more about being a runway model which I

276
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,240
read had a lot of respect for models to

277
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:00,160
begin with but after actually doing it

278
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,900
it's very very challenging I will say -

279
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,000
I got to be a model for an amazing

280
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,200
designer Danny 3 a lot of my friends

281
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,270
were involved which made it even more

282
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,280
fun drew Laura and Nikita also walked

283
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:11,560
the runway in a beautiful outfit and for

284
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:17,080
your girl needed some redemption because

285
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:19,450
my laughs oh my walk that walk oh my

286
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:21,040
goodness it was diabolical

287
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:22,960
also April is always my favorite event

288
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,910
of the entire year which is Coachella

289
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,310
now I'm not gonna go into too much

290
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:28,840
detail about this for very obvious

291
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:30,730
bittersweet reasons but on a positive

292
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,290
note I've had to see ariana grande and

293
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:33,640
black pink and Billy Eilish all her fur

294
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:35,350
alive and they are three of my favorite

295
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,880
artists of all times that was so much

296
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:39,370
fun I got to hang out all my best

297
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,380
friends and my outputs were sickening oh

298
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:43,030
my god they caused quite a ruckus and

299
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:44,440
stir on social media I will say it but

300
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:46,210
honestly I was kind of the point of them

301
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,350
my bunch looked phenomenal I just had

302
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:49,000
like the best time running around the

303
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:50,710
festival my literal butt cheeks hanging

304
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,270
out it's crazy that is to say I just

305
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:53,440
felt so confident and so free and I

306
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:55,120
think that's honestly the point of

307
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,590
Coachella as a whole so I'm very excited

308
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,390
to see what this year's outfits have to

309
00:08:56,590 --> 00:09:00,190
offer now the next month of the year is

310
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:02,020
May and obviously we know the two things

311
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:03,130
that happen at that month first being at

312
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,360
the Met Gala I got to work with

313
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:05,590
Alexander Wang who's with me

314
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,540
they were designers of all time for my

315
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:08,890
safety pen top and I just felt so cool

316
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:10,570
being there but also just like so

317
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:11,860
nervous and overwhelmed as well because

318
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:13,270
that was one of the first times that

319
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:14,620
they ever had youtubers at an event like

320
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:16,150
that which was obviously a major

321
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,890
breakthrough and like the social media

322
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:19,870
space I was there without Lilly Singh

323
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,250
and Liza Koshi who I have so much

324
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:22,990
respect for it's not even funny the

325
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:27,640
onset of the Met Gala in May of course

326
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:29,140
we all know I also had my birthday

327
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,430
taking a super quick pause from the

328
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,270
recap I just wanna quickly show you guys

329
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:33,160
saying that I've been doing a lot

330
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:34,450
recently during my nose at contour stop

331
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,830
just cover a little bit of concealer on

332
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:37,330
the back of my hand and a fluffy a dense

333
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:39,220
brush I'm just going to pop this

334
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:41,380
concealer into my eyelid and then just

335
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:42,730
really quickly set that into a place my

336
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,990
contouring process on my face in my nose

337
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:44,980
is pretty much the exact same which is

338
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,940
why I skipped through it because you

339
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:47,470
guys said to me do it literally a

340
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:48,940
million times but there is one thing

341
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:51,040
that I do a little bit differently so

342
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:52,510
I'm gonna take my fluffy blending

343
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,459
I'd give it to my same kind of like

344
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:56,170
bronzy contouring shade and then I like

345
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:57,670
to take this fluffy brush and at the top

346
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:58,930
of my nose contour okay I'm not talking

347
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:00,520
about like the skinny horse because we

348
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:01,209
still wanted to be very very sad but in

349
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,370
this lake

350
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:05,020
kind of round area in between the nose

351
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:06,880
and your eyebrow who was going to run

352
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:08,709
this color right up into here blending

353
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,880
it into the front of the eyebrow but I'm

354
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:11,500
also going to take the excess of that

355
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:14,350
color and blend it through the crease

356
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:15,730
and then pull it up towards my temple as

357
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,990
you can see between this eyelid and this

358
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:18,490
eyelid there is a noticeable difference

359
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:20,170
this one has a little bit more shadow in

360
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:21,910
here and with this kind of like lion

361
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:23,680
flagging up and out like that I just

362
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:25,600
kind of like pulls the eye upwards for

363
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,440
is this eye is just completely flat so I

364
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,970
think it just adds a really nice

365
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,290
definition into the eyelid it pulls

366
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:30,670
everything up nicely and it gives the

367
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:32,020
nose contour sling to kind of blend into

368
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,980
instead of just doing like two Brown

369
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,300
lines on the side of your nose

370
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,800
definitely recommend trying this out if

371
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,180
you guys have never before before I move

372
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,740
on to the brows in the eyes I do want to

373
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:40,120
add a little bit of dimension into the

374
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:42,550
face so I'm just gonna grab this pinky

375
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:44,440
tone up blush from Mac eye for the

376
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:46,029
longest time hated pinky tone blushes

377
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,320
but I've really been liking it more

378
00:10:46,029 --> 00:10:48,820
pinky tone blushes recently I believe

379
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,260
they look very very useful and cute

380
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:54,250
stepping back into my Anasazi contour

381
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:55,930
palette with my this brush I'm just

382
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:58,630
gonna dip into the lighter shade and use

383
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:59,890
this to highlight underneath my eyes so

384
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:01,540
the next month was Jude which was

385
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:03,130
honestly a pretty quiet month for me but

386
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:04,839
I wouldn't have wanted it any other way

387
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:07,209
it was a much-needed time of healing

388
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:08,529
positivity and just relaxation and being

389
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:09,550
around the people that I love the most

390
00:11:08,529 --> 00:11:11,589
and doing the things that I love the

391
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:13,240
most so I didn't do a whole lot but it

392
00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:14,800
did end up with a really really positive

393
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,630
no which I'm gonna talk about while I do

394
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,950
my eyebrows starting off I got to sing

395
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:19,750
at the national anthem with to my best

396
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:21,100
friends Zoe and Anthony at a charity

397
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,750
basketball game at the Staples Center

398
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:24,370
which was I don't even know the words

399
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:27,390
that I have to explain how incredible

400
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:27,390
that opportunity was

401
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:35,300
[Applause]

402
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:37,160
and it was just exactly what I needed

403
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,660
and during that time so that was saying

404
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,580
that I'm really really grateful for and

405
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:42,020
then literally a from that game we drove

406
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:43,760
directly to the airport and then flew to

407
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:45,200
in New York on a red-eye because the

408
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,970
next day I was walking in the Pride

409
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,050
Parade with The Trevor Project it's

410
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:49,550
really crazy to think about because I've

411
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:50,840
been out as a gay man since I was 12

412
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:52,730
years old which is almost half of my

413
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:54,440
life and I grew up in New York and then

414
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:55,970
moved to LA three years ago which are

415
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,350
two of the most accepting places like

416
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:59,300
literally in the entire world but for

417
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:00,590
some reason I was never able to attend

418
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,360
any pride events there was always

419
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:03,920
something on my calendar going on where

420
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:07,850
I couldn't go so this is my first Pride

421
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:09,470
ever but it was so much fun oh my god it

422
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:10,940
just really made me so grateful and

423
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:12,710
proud to be part of my community and I

424
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:14,510
am very much looking forward to making

425
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:15,770
sure my calendar is cleared for future

426
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:17,030
pride events all right you guys I just

427
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:18,650
do in doing so I can focus on the eyes

428
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:19,970
super quickly like I said we are not

429
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:21,350
doing any eyeshadow with this look but I

430
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:22,850
do want to pop on it just a slight

431
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:24,530
little wing just to kind of a further

432
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:26,060
pull up the faith and essentially

433
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:28,100
everything is so what I'm gonna do first

434
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:29,720
is grab my morphe MFI hold a brush and

435
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,370
just dip back into my contour palette

436
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:33,200
from before and tip into the darkest

437
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:34,730
brown shade in the corner and just gonna

438
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,130
create a little wing at the outer corner

439
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:38,060
of my eye using this color it's looking

440
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:39,020
that looks really bad because we're

441
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,970
gonna blow into that in a second anyway

442
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:43,430
but I'm basically just topping this

443
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:44,570
shade and the shapeable wing now with

444
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:46,190
that same broad brush from before and

445
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:48,170
that same brow powder actually I'm just

446
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:50,990
going to dip back into that dark brown

447
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:52,790
shade and I'm gonna use this color and

448
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:54,560
be it much more careful and go right up

449
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:56,840
against the lash line and create a

450
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,130
little bit more of a defined way I

451
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,600
really like using the brow powder for

452
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:01,130
this because it has pigment to it but

453
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,200
it's not like a super super opaque

454
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:04,460
eyeshadow so you actually have time to

455
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,720
layer up a little bit another trick that

456
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:07,280
I've been doing a lot recently is taking

457
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:09,950
that same a brow powder and that angled

458
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:11,930
brush and creating a very tiny line at

459
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:13,580
the inner corner point of my eye

460
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:15,950
pulling the upwards following the shape

461
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:17,780
of Lian natural lid and as you can see

462
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:21,710
this just elongate my eyes a little bit

463
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:23,240
and really furthers that like I thought

464
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:24,950
and the loss of that is just gonna be

465
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:27,200
grabbing a little bit more of my amound

466
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:29,180
ation on a little brush and I'm just

467
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,260
going to clean up the bottom of that

468
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:34,510
wing for a super sharp

469
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:36,700
July for me was actually a pretty good

470
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:37,960
month not a whole lot happened to be

471
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,040
quite honest it was the middle of summer

472
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,500
and we were honestly just going to have

473
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,840
a good time but it was gonna like to

474
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:45,640
start to me getting back into like my

475
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,200
normal day-to-day routine again which

476
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,730
was pretty awesome this summer because

477
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,380
of pewdiepie making a bunch of Minecraft

478
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:52,450
videos the Minecraft community on

479
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:54,160
YouTube really like skyrocketed once

480
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:55,720
again and kind of revived the game which

481
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,400
was a really amazing for me because

482
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,960
despite the fact that I love makeup I

483
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,820
actually speak you Jay more as a kid

484
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,410
which a lot of you guys know about

485
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:04,000
minecraft was a huge huge hobby of mine

486
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:05,830
and growing up especially the Hunger

487
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,660
Games so when the Minecraft Monday's

488
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:09,580
tournament was announced I was all-in

489
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:10,750
and so excited to get to play it was a

490
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,980
really cool thing for me to be part of

491
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,480
it I'm honestly so grateful for the

492
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:15,520
experience and I was so pleasantly

493
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,350
surprised by how nice and how kind and

494
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,550
how welcoming and how funny everyone in

495
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,780
the gaming world was when it came to me

496
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:21,190
playing in the tournament I just had the

497
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:22,870
best time I looked forward to it every

498
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:24,070
single week I'm so sad that it ended I

499
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:25,690
genuinely missed the community that we

500
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:27,100
built up but if it ever comes back y'all

501
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:28,960
know that I'll be ready to slay and who

502
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,910
knows maybe in 2020 I'll sort of gaming

503
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,630
channel probably not but let me know if

504
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:34,000
you guys want to see more of that

505
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:35,800
content now next comes August and during

506
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,170
this month I mean probably one of the

507
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:41,080
biggest mistakes of my entire year which

508
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:43,330
was please shank my head it obviously

509
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,980
made for a very very ending YouTube

510
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:46,840
video one of the funniest I think we've

511
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:48,160
ever posted I loved the way that I

512
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,420
looked with platinum hair the after

513
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,070
effects are Berber not so great because

514
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:52,570
after a few months it started to get

515
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:54,280
really damaged and I tried to bleed to

516
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:55,630
intone it I think one too many times and

517
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,980
then eventually one morning I took a

518
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:58,360
shower and went to wash my hair and

519
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,100
realized that my hair that was falling

520
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,780
out of my head so that was a really

521
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,670
really unfortunate discovery that I have

522
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:06,160
now been dealing with the repercussions

523
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:08,020
of ever since but it's been about three

524
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,030
months now of hair regrowth and

525
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:11,530
obviously I'm dr. Brown I'm feeling way

526
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:13,120
better and much more confident now but

527
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:15,640
unless I'm wearing a wig I will probably

528
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,650
have brown hair for majority of 2020

529
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:19,030
letting you guys know right now also for

530
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:21,100
lashes today I just popped on a pair of

531
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:23,230
Lily lashes and the style Miami flares

532
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,670
you can use coach James for 15% off of

533
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:26,020
those lashes Lily or if anybody from

534
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:27,520

536
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,370
them like a look at how pretty that is

537
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,390
hello

538
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:32,500
alright you guys those are both eyes all

539
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:34,250
complete and we were almost another

540
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,810
makeup routine I'm just gonna go ahead

541
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:38,270
my mom any excess powder that we have

542
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:40,430
left on the face while we finish up the

543
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:42,410
rest of the year September was quite a

544
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:43,640
jam-packed moment it started off with

545
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:46,220
learning how to dance with Abby Lee

546
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:49,040
Miller or at least trying 200mw Lee

547
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:50,840
Miller I also got the opportunity to go

548
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,760
back to New York for a fashion week in

549
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,840
September which was so much fun I am

550
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,730
very much looking forward to doing more

551
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:58,160
fashion related things and trying to up

552
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:59,900
my style in 2020 at the end of September

553
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,640
I finally got to meet my new best friend

554
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:03,230
for a light and that is when we adopted

555
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,130
our Golden Retriever puppy which we

556
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,180
named Finnegan

557
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,560
I haven't thinking about adopting a

558
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:08,360
puppy since I moved into this new house

559
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,890
which is over a year ago now but it's a

560
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,390
temper at the time I finally felt right

561
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:12,470
we weren't traveling we were home and I

562
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:14,060
was finally kind of getting everything

563
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:15,350
back together during the month of

564
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,700
September I was obviously still posting

565
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:18,350
YouTube videos and Instagram photos and

566
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:20,270
stuff and try my best to put on a smile

567
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:21,740
for the camera because I would be

568
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:23,150
completely lying if I said that I was

569
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:24,830
happy during that month because I was

570
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,850
not at all and I was still really trying

571
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:27,610
hard to just get everything back

572
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:29,570
together working with mental health and

573
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:31,790
obviously Finnegan doesn't know this but

574
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:33,620
he helped me is so much during that time

575
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:35,060
period just having somebody an animal to

576
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:36,860
hog in to cuddle with at night and just

577
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:39,500
working on training him and welcoming

578
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:40,610
into the home it made me so much happier

579
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,980
and really helped my mood and just

580
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:45,200
seeing how he's crawling so much over

581
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:47,000
the past days I forgot his huge now has

582
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,980
just been a major major light in my life

583
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,840
when I really needed most so yeah he's

584
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:53,420
like I said my new best friend and I'm

585
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:54,860
so was so glad that we finally finally

586
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:56,240
made the move and adopted him because

587
00:16:54,860 --> 00:17:00,020
it's been like the best decision that

588
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,400
I've ever ever made whoo next up as we

589
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:03,080
all know comes October which is that

590
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,610
spooky season of my favorite time of the

591
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,050
entire year that we started out this

592
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:08,120
month with quite a bang with the James

593
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:10,010
house ex Murphy at mini how much which I

594
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,940
just used my hair in a blush like I said

595
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:12,110
in there until they do this was not

596
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:14,240
supposed to be anything crazy or

597
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:15,740
groundbreaking for 2019 in the makeup

598
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,270
community this is truly for the hardcore

599
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:18,530
fans the lovers of the original palette

600
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,610
they wanted something more small and

601
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:20,810
travel friendly and I think we

602
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:22,490
definitely delivered that along with an

603
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:23,930
incredible campaign that I got to work

604
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:25,190
with the wigs and makeup my other job

605
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:26,510
November was honestly a really really

606
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:28,490
fun month as well I got to go to Las

607
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:30,620
Vegas Nevada for an Ulta ex Murphy meet

608
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:31,640
and greet which was so much fun I will

609
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:34,100
forever remember that me in Greek

610
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:35,960
because of how nice every single person

611
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,280
that I met was the time flew by so fast

612
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,840
as I was generally just styling and the

613
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,060
entire time I also went back home to

614
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:42,830
upstate New York for at Thanksgiving

615
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,360
which was an experience and a half to

616
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:46,120
say at the least we also launched the

617
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,470
sisters apparel holiday collection which

618
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,790
really amazing and I'm so grateful for

619
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:50,200
your guys to support odd and then

620
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:51,100
finally we ended off the month with an

621
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,680
announcement that I've been waiting

622
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:55,270
three years to make and that was that I

623
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:57,610
got the opportunity to produce my very

624
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:59,530
own reality competition show on one set

625
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:00,790
of YouTube for the beauty community now

626
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:02,440
we've been working on it since that

627
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:03,640
announcement non-stop and the filming

628
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,340

629
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,750
which is huh so what I would think about

630
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:09,490
there are still so many things to get

631
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,870
done so I've been scrambling behind the

632
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:12,640
scenes to work on everything but it's

633
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:13,960
been such a fun and incredible process

634
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,030
and I know that you guys are going to

635
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:18,550

636
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:19,960
something so positive for 2020 which is

637
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:21,429

656
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,260
