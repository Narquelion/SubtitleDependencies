00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:42,170
in our cheeks a little bit our forehead

42
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:44,180
and in your hair a little bit it doesn't

43
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:46,250
look like it did much but we're gonna

44
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:48,650
use it anyways alright now we're going

45
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:51,110
back into our big nose we're going to

46
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:53,060
blend it with our big eyebrows so we're

47
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:54,710
going to connect the two you're gonna do

48
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:56,350
that by putting a straight line down

49
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:59,210
your nose trying to make it look skinny

50
00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:00,620
but we all know it's not skinny then

51
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:03,440
we're going to reinforce it with this

52
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:07,549
dirty sponge again make it nice and

53
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:09,140
straight lines good job James so it's

54
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:10,610
good encourage yourself alright now

55
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:14,240
we're gonna use this baby powder on her

56
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:16,360
cheeks and our ear a little bit and then

57
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:19,240
we're going to put underneath her eyes

58
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:22,300
kind of basically cover up all the work

59
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,740
we just did and we're gonna I guess

60
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,630
we're gonna just let it sit there and

61
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:27,610
now we're gonna go into the eyebrows

62
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:29,350
again all right so you're gonna draw a

63
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:30,910
nice little straight line all the way

64
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:33,000
across underneath your eyebrows then

65
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:36,430
we're gonna fill in those caterpillars

66
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,900
continue that straight line um you don't

67
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:39,160
want to forget those stragglers off to

68
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,290
the side so make sure you go back and

69
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,070
get him and kind of push them all over

70
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:44,320
there you go

71
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:46,330
all right so James [ __ ] up so he's

72
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,700
going back to those lines and he's gonna

73
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:51,880
make it nice and perfect and then this

74
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:56,350
next product so I guess we're gonna use

75
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:57,250
this mascara for his eyebrows yeah I

76
00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:00,160
guess that works

77
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:02,290
yep ones done not done and then now

78
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,390
we're done I wish it was that fast when

79
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:05,590
it took him six hours to do makeup now

80
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:07,120
we're gonna go into another dirty

81
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:09,280
palette we're gonna start with this

82
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,200
peach color and I put it in our eyelids

83
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,209
pretty pointless doesn't look like you

84
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,430
did much then I'm gonna use this second

85
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:17,320
color I'm gonna try to blend those two

86
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:19,780
colors in together to make a new color

87
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:21,400
whole point of this is you know to get

88
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,200
that unique color so in this case

89
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,500
there's like 60 different colors because

90
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,970
I brushed it really dirty Oh 61 I guess

91
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,440
this is the burgundy eye look we're

92
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:31,600
going for it and then we're gonna use

93
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,580
some of this glitter that he got and

94
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:36,400
we're gonna put it just in the corner of

95
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:37,870
the eye yep looks good James all right

96
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,030
now we're going to use this little

97
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:42,269
marker we're gonna make a nice little

98
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:45,610
triangle point on the corner of your eye

99
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:48,340
make sure it's nice and straight and I

100
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:49,840
guess now he's going ball a cross into

101
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,040
the glitter pretty pointless what's the

102
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,739
point of putting on the glitter if it's

103
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:56,050
gonna cover it James all right now he's

104
00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:57,850
gonna finish this look off by making his

105
00:03:56,050 --> 00:04:01,180
whole eye look purple and they're gonna

106
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:03,130
use this new clean brush finally to put

107
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,840
the rest of the glitter then we're gonna

108
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:06,940
put these bad boys on these big old

109
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,440
butterfly lashes make sure they're all

110
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:10,750
nice and straight you don't want to be

111
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:12,880
at a party and dangling off that guy's

112
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:15,370

now we're gonna use this product I think

116
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:27,480
it's time for James to do a singing note

117
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:29,100
so glazed donut is being finished by

118
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,180

00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:36,510
it's not then now we're gonna go into

122
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,430
