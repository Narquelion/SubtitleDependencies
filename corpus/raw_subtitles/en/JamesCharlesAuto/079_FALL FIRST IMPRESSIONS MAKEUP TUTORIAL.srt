00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,250
I'll like the falling leaves and the hot

7
00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:15,360
cocoa and the pumpkin spice lattes and

8
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,340
the cute decorations and

9
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,960
trick-or-treating at Halloween oh my god

00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,340
I literally love it so much and I am so

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,350

Browns oh I am so so so here for it

14
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,380
obviously I'm fortunate I live in LA

15
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,510
well not really unfortunately I love it

16
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,949
here but in LA it is still very very hot

17
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,989
so I'm literally dying in this

18
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:35,690
turtleneck and denim jacket but I had to

19
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:38,010
get into the fall mood for you guys

20
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:39,570
sacrifices last night well my fighters

21
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,520

22
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,559

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,610

over here is unboxed everything and I

29
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,230
literally realized how much freaking

30
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,730
makeup I've been sent in the past few

31
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,829
weeks I was a little bit shook because I

32
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,930
had like literally 30 boxes to open but

33
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:02,760
I was so excited to try a ton of view

34
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,899
products for today's video I grabbed a

35
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,309
bunch of products that are new releases

36
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,830
or products that I have not yet tried

37
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:09,900
out and did a full face of fall first

38
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,729
impressions makeup and I absolutely love

39
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,810
how this look turned out spoiler alert

40
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:15,210
almost all the products that they use

41
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,950
today are really really really great so

42
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,509
without further ado if you'd like to see

43
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,920
how I created this look today using all

44
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:21,030
brand new products that are actually new

45
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,799
to my regular routine because I know

46
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:25,350
sister James is not switch it up very

47
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:31,170
often gyri picady junkies and let's get

48
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:32,460
started alright guys so I'm first gonna

49
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,040
start off by priming my face using the

50
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:37,470
no horrible um primer from touch and

51
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,930
soul this is a smooth and pore covering

52
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:41,520
a top-secret for perfect makeup primer

53
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,229
and I'm very very excited to try this

54
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,490
out I know a sister Jeffrey twice about

55
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:45,600
this all the time on his channel and

56
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:47,490
absolutely stands by it

57
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,820
I for one haven't actually never tried

58
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:52,110
it before so I'm very pumped you guys

59
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,670
know that my skin has actually been a

60
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,229
pretty good recently because I've been

61
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,119
moisturizing a lot but I definitely

62
00:01:55,229 --> 00:02:00,960
still have a lot of pores unfortunately

63
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,130
oh wow this feels really good so three

64
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,229
seconds in and I already like this

65
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:06,990
primer it feels so incredibly like

66
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:08,369
smooth and the poreless but that being

67
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,080
said I absolutely have no product on my

68
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:11,580
face right now so let's go to some

69
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,849
foundation and see how it actually holds

70
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,409
up

71
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:15,329
for foundations today are gonna be going

72
00:02:13,409 --> 00:02:16,709
into the milk makeup blur liquid

73
00:02:15,329 --> 00:02:18,719
foundation and this isn't the shade of

74
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:19,590
golden light I hope this is the right

75
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:21,659
shade for me

76
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:23,040
these released a few weeks ago on a milk

77
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:25,290
makeup but I actually have not gotten a

78
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,109
chance to try them out but many of my

79
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:29,189
friends really really like this so I'm

80
00:02:28,109 --> 00:02:31,200
gonna try it out for myself

81
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:32,730
I definitely like a good full coverage

82
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,189
foundation and you guys know that I am a

83
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,959
hardcore stand of the make up ever ultra

84
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:38,939
oh that's a good match think on of the

85
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,349
Make Up For Ever Ultra HD stick so it's

86
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:42,060
pretty hard at this point to ever beat

87
00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:43,889
that one but let's go ahead and apply

88
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,329
this and see what we think so this is a

89
00:02:43,889 --> 00:02:47,579
liquid foundation that is set to dry

90
00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:49,409
down in a natural matte formula meaning

91
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:50,909
it it's like pretty matte but still has

92
00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:52,709
like a little bit of do to it which is

93
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:54,299
definitely the styler foundation that I

94
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:56,819
like you guys know that I am really not

95
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:58,769
digging like the full baked full matte

96
00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:00,329
look anymore and I do like a little bit

97
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:01,829
of a natural glow so holding this

98
00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:03,629
foundation if it does what it says will

99
00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:04,919
be a really really great one for me okay

100
00:03:03,629 --> 00:03:06,449
so the foundation was all applied and

101
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:08,879
blend out and I don't love it but I also

102
00:03:06,449 --> 00:03:10,199
don't hate it at all the match of color

103
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,669
is really really good free and I'm

104
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:13,590
definitely like a fan of this it matches

105
00:03:11,669 --> 00:03:15,480
my scanner pretty well which is a very

106
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:16,979
rare occasion on the channels YouTube

107
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,919
channel I know you guys always drive me

108
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:21,359
for it my skin texture it looks decent

109
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:22,590
I've had foundations I think my skin

110
00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:24,540
look better and it's definitely hot ones

111
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:25,739
that made it look worse I noticed that

112
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,359
it is deadly so I'm pretty a little bit

113
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:28,889
on my nose which I hate you guys know

114
00:03:27,359 --> 00:03:30,209
that's like my biggest pet peeve when it

115
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:32,250
comes to nose contour not being able to

116
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:34,139
have like a perfect one so not loving

117
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,310
that the coverage is really really good

118
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:37,229
though because I skin look very very

119
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:38,340
even all that being said I'm gonna go

120
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:39,509
ahead and apply the rest of my routine

121
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,159
now and I will come back to the

122
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:42,479
foundation later on and see how it wears

123
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:44,099
that everything else later on top

124
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:45,269
obviously I don't have any dupe

125
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,799
concealers to try out today so I'm just

126
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:48,449
gonna use my handy dandy shave tape in

127
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,280
the shade of light okay so actually

128
00:03:48,449 --> 00:03:51,840
after Lang shaped tape over top of the

129
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,909
foundation I like how this looks a lot

130
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,799
more and layered over top especially in

131
00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:57,419
like the poor region really really

132
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:59,519
nicely I love my under eyes look right

133
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:01,859
now as well as my nose was fixed by the

134
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,599
same tape thank God we're not about to

135
00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:04,859
have a walking nose contour today those

136
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,540
days are long gone

137
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:07,859
I'm gonna go ahead and set my face in

138
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:10,469
the normal place he's using the brand

139
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:11,219
new two-faced peach perfect modifying

140
00:04:10,469 --> 00:04:12,719
setting powder

141
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:14,039
I know Jackie ina said she loved this

142
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,320
I've been super looking forward to

143
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:17,909
trying oh and yeah hopefully we won't

144
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,079
get any flash like marriage today I'm

145
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:20,060
just gonna make sure any creases that I

146
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,920
have under there

147
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,990
gone and then just pack on the setting

148
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:27,530
powder oh my god actually smells like

149
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:28,430
peaches ah that sounds the best ever oh

150
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:30,889
my god

151
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:33,590
okay whoa talk about a mattifying sign

152
00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:36,110
encoder my face looks like as dry as the

153
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:37,490
Sahara Desert but not like a bad way I'm

154
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,870
honestly really taking it but I'm

155
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:42,200
definitely gonna have to apply a lot of

156
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:44,060
highlighter later on ask for the actual

157
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,680
powder first of all it smells literally

158
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:47,120
the best like this is really really good

159
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,500
I don't think I've ever had a setting

160
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,389
powder that actually smelled like good

161
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:53,120
and not like actual death or like

162
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:55,790
Grandma which is my so I like this a lot

163
00:04:53,120 --> 00:05:00,050
and looking up close my pores are like

164
00:04:55,790 --> 00:05:02,090
gone like literally they look so covered

165
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:03,680
and filled in this honestly may very

166
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:04,910
well be a brand new favorite I know I

167
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,050
don't really like baking any more but

168
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:08,180
I'm gonna go ahead and use this powder

169
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:09,710
to lightly baked just to see if it does

170
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:11,270
bring any intensity and brightness back

171
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,919
to the face especially I like the nose

172
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,910
contour region underneath the contour

173
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:15,410
like I always do

174
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:16,610
but before I do that I'm gonna go ahead

175
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:19,580
and stretch my face a few times using

176
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:22,100
some mac fix+ just because I'm looking

177
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:23,990
extremely dry right now and I need some

178
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,790
of that hydration bra back at my Vegas

179
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,020
now let's get up nose as usual using my

180
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:28,220
Beauty Blender and pack it on to the

181
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:29,840
areas that I want to be a little bit

182
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,950
brighter before I actually go to my

183
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,510
brows I'm gonna add a little bit of

184
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:34,640
blush using the brand new Anasazi a

185
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:35,750
blush kit and the shade radiant I would

186
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,250
normally do this before I actually make

187
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:39,350
my face but it completely slipped my

188
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:41,810
mind I'm gonna use this shade in the top

189
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:43,370
right hand corner called coastline it is

190
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:44,990
so pretty under mine see a little bit of

191
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:46,850
the amok in the shade peaches which you

192
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:49,210
guys always my multi-faith and I'm just

193
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:52,310
gonna apply this using my more pe4 brush

194
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:54,020
well that is really pigmented okay so we

195
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:55,760
all know Anastacio does not play around

196
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,410
when it comes to pigment but I deftly

197
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,150
put on a little bit too much I'm gonna

198
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:01,010
grab my ours your brush from morphe and

199
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,840
just my face powder and go over that a

200
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:04,940
little bit to kind of make it a little

201
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,710
bit more subtle so now that my face is

202
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:08,210
all done and baking the oven at 350

203
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:10,070
degrees we have a little bit of a

204
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:11,479
cooking malfunction there but we're

205
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:13,160
gonna go ahead and move on and next is

206
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:14,539
going to be the brows today I don't have

207
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,560
any new brow products to try out for you

208
00:06:14,539 --> 00:06:17,419
guys so I'm just gonna go in with my

209
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,800
normal benefit brow products I'm gonna

210
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:20,690
first go in with the benefit car brow

211
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,669
gel in the shade number 4 and start to

212
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:24,169
to find out the tail as you guys know

213
00:06:22,669 --> 00:06:25,729
there was actually a really good long

214
00:06:24,169 --> 00:06:27,560
while where I stopped using pomade

215
00:06:25,729 --> 00:06:28,960
products on my brows altogether and just

216
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,330
went over to a pencil

217
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:34,900
I feel like the old James Charles block

218
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:36,729
IRA was so so bad and a very touchy and

219
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,990
dark subject we should talk about I

220
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:39,699
think what cause that was way too much

221
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:41,530
brow pomade so I just stopped using it

222
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:42,820
altogether but recently I've kind of

223
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:44,710
been getting it back into it just to

224
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:47,110
like really define it the brows and get

225
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:48,910
super super sharp lines and honestly I'm

226
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:50,080
actually kind of living for it we just

227
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:52,720
have to make sure that we don't get back

228
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,800
into that original Brown style again as

229
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,870
always I'm just gonna grab a little bit

230
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,570
of concealer on my morphe e43 brush and

231
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:59,919
clean up that bottom edge once eyebrow

232
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:01,960
is all cleaned up and defined I'm gonna

233
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,729
grab the 24-hour brow setter and use

234
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,560
this to brush all the hair Stinton place

235
00:07:03,729 --> 00:07:07,180
I've actually been using this a lot more

236
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,190
than the Gimme brow gel and I still love

237
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:10,870
gimme brow don't get me wrong but this

238
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:12,340
one is clear it just does a really good

239
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:13,720
job of brushing the hair is like into

240
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:16,150
place but also keeping them like

241
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,979
literally glued down it's almost like a

242
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:19,960
liquid version of hairspray and it's I

243
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:21,639
like this law so now that the brows are

244
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,259
all slayed and locked in place we're

245
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:25,449
gonna move on to the eye shadow and for

246
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:27,190
today I do have a new first impressions

247
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:29,050
that I am literally so excited to try

248
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:30,940
out and that is the Laura Lee Los

249
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:33,370
Angeles cat's pajamas eyes shadow

250
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:35,560
palette I cannot wait so this is the

251
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:38,289
actual palette it is absolutely stunning

252
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:40,720
it comes with ten shades for $40 which

253
00:07:38,289 --> 00:07:42,729
is only $4 a shadow which is not bad at

254
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,560
all I will say I have not put this on my

255
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:47,710
eyes but I definitely haven't done a few

256
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,330
swatches and this is so incredibly good

257
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:51,130
let's just do like let's just do one

258
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:52,539
just to show you guys I'm gonna go ahead

259
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:55,830
and grab the shade of redonkulous on my

260
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:55,830
middle finger we're just gonna do like

261
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:08,369
like you're kidding

262
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:09,929
it is so pigmented as Manny would say my

263
00:08:08,369 --> 00:08:12,359
first girl the shade okie-dokie on my

264
00:08:09,929 --> 00:08:15,299
m/45 brush and just uses to stuff the

265
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:16,619
eyelid in place to prepare for shadow so

266
00:08:15,299 --> 00:08:18,479
first good our way I'm four for one and

267
00:08:16,619 --> 00:08:20,459
dip into the shade bomb-diggity and uses

268
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,569
of the transition ok whoa those that

269
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:22,949
feel a little bit a kickback on the

270
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:24,839
shadow but I really don't like that oh

271
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:26,609
that just means it's really pigmented so

272
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:28,229
hopefully this isn't like the Anasazi of

273
00:08:26,609 --> 00:08:30,719
self culture point but let's put an

274
00:08:28,229 --> 00:08:32,430
apply and see how it blends in oh yeah

275
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:34,110
okay whoa the shade of Lee blends out

276
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:35,759
not as vibrant as you see in the palette

277
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:37,559
but that is definitely not a negative

278
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:39,059
for me at all this shade looks

279
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,559
absolutely beautiful as a transition

280
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:43,050
shade in the eyelid crease and it is

281
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:46,110
blending like butter like that looks

282
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:48,300
really really good oh my god

283
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:50,040
yes sister Laura I'm next going to grab

284
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,689
a clean m4a3 three brush and dip into

285
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,220
the shade of cray-cray and deepen up the

286
00:08:51,689 --> 00:08:54,720
crease a little bit you guys a little

287
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,480
could knock it over how well these

288
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,550
shades are blending together like Deezer

289
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,220
really really good shadows that looks so

290
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:03,870
good oh my god I'm next to me I have

291
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:05,670
another m4a3 three brush and dip into

292
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:07,079
the shade it kooky and use that once

293
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,540
again to deepen up the crease a little

294
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:11,699
bit and prepare for the eyelid shadow

295
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:13,230
I'm honestly so shocked right now like I

296
00:09:11,699 --> 00:09:14,670
was expecting this to be good but like

297
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:16,529
this eye look is literally blending it

298
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:20,339
sounds like you guys are watching this

299
00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:21,689
all go down I'm like whoa if you guys

300
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:23,970
haven't noticed it's actually really

301
00:09:21,689 --> 00:09:25,920
really rare for makeup brands to include

302
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:27,809
reds or Maroons in their palettes

303
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,910
because a red formula is really really

304
00:09:27,809 --> 00:09:31,860
hard to perfect and make it pigment in

305
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:33,629
it to blend enough on the eyes and the

306
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:35,279
fact that Laura included it in her first

307
00:09:33,629 --> 00:09:38,009
palette and it's actually like really

308
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:40,230
good is major major points in my buck I

309
00:09:38,009 --> 00:09:41,430
can't even tell you I am so so sick of

310
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:42,899
having palettes that are full of

311
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:44,309
beautiful beautiful oranges and there is

312
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:46,829
not a single red shade on my girl

313
00:09:44,309 --> 00:09:50,670
I need the Maroons I need the Reds I

314
00:09:46,829 --> 00:09:52,199

Wow

this shade is absolutely beautiful just

335
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,220
add a little bit more dimension I'm

336
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:41,550
gonna grab a tiny fluffy brush this is

337
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:42,930

00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,260
my god get it in one ear and out the

339
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:45,690
other

340
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:47,040
so freakin clever and I'm gonna use this

341
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:48,180
to it deepen up the outer corner a

342
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,590
little bit for the news in that stay

343
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,450
brush I'm gonna grab the littlest bit of

344
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:53,490
the shade oddball and really deep it out

345
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:55,230
just that or a V just to add some more

346
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:56,820
down and then to finish off the upper

347
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:58,350
lid I'm gonna grab my on 5/13 at one

348
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,150
last time and dip right back to cry cry

349
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:02,940
and then I'm just going to buff out

350
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:05,130
those edges I love how this is turning

351
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:06,420
out oh my god for the lower lash then

352
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:07,770
I'm first gonna go my own for a 3:3

353
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:09,600
brush and the shade of Craig right and

354
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:10,740
just put in a light transition shade and

355
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,030
I always like to make sure especially in

356
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,860
this outer corner here that the lower

357
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:15,690
lashline and upper lashline shadow are

358
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,460
connected what my biggest have peace

359
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:19,620
ever some people have like a nice sharp

360
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:21,870
defined line right here to cut that like

361
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:23,430
powder shadow wing and then all it's on

362
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,540
the bottom lash line shadow starts but

363
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:27,810
they're not connected like there's

364
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:28,770
literally like a I just I really hate

365
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:30,360
how that looks so next thing I grab my

366
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:32,490
m1 tube for our brush and dip into the

367
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:35,040
shade at Kuki and use this to hug my

368
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:36,540
upper or my lower lash line next to my

369
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,460
gram I am a five five nine and didn't

370
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:41,040
took the shade it Corky and use that to

371
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:42,930
deep it up right up at the lash line and

372
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,010
then finally describing a little tiny

373
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:45,810
bit more of oddball

374
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:47,040
just to deepen up that very outer corner

375
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:48,600
to highlight the brow bone I'm gonna

376
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,550
grab the shade a scatterbrain on just a

377
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:54,540
flat packing brush and it'll brought

378
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:55,740
that on there oh wow I'm also gonna play

379
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:57,540
a little bit of that on the inner corner

380
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,650
as well okay I was gonna save all my

381
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,610
thoughts until the end of the video but

382
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:01,350
I'll just go ahead and say it right now

383
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:03,090
because I feel confident and my answer

384
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:05,460
that this palette from Laura Lee Los

385
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:08,250
Angeles the cat's pajamas palette is so

386
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:09,510
so good I honestly was not expecting

387
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,400
anything less than really great from

388
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:13,710
lore but this how it like really it's

389
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:15,390
just beyond great as you can see the

390
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:16,120
shadows blend so well together they are

391
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:17,320
incredibly

392
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,279
when said if there would be one negative

393
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,720
thing about it that I would want to

394
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:21,610
mention is that some of the shadows do

395
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,870
have a lot of Fallout which I don't see

396
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:24,490
a personal problem with it that just

397
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:25,720
means a really pigmented if anything

398
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:27,580
just make sure you tap your brush before

399
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,930
you actually put it on or just make your

400
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,810
face you can wave everything away at the

401
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:33,850
end but like I said this palette 10 out

402
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:35,470
of 10 definitely sister James recommend

403
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:37,150
do it alright so I just went ahead I did

404
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:39,370
the other eye off-camera super quickly

405
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:41,230
and that the eyes are both done I'm

406
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:43,900
gonna apply some lashes today as always

407
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:45,430
but I do have a new first impressions

408
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:47,740
today and those are the more feet

409
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:48,910
eyelashes I am obviously a morphe

410
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:50,860

415

all your sisters merch anyway all that

416
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:01,660
being said I was up the morphe office a

417
00:13:00,339 --> 00:13:02,740
few weeks ago and i was like looking

418
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:04,300
through all their products and I was

419
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:06,940
like wait a second are those lashes and

420
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:08,560
one we hold Murphy has lashes which I

421
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:10,150
literally did not even know about they

422
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,529
were not announced I just kind of came

423
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:13,510
to the store but they look beautiful

424
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:15,400
then I'm gonna be applying in style i

425
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:17,260
traction which look very very similar to

426
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,860
the house lashes like onyx and they are

427
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,060
stunning

428
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:21,250
so while I clean all these launches I

429
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:22,779
guess I will give you guys the rundown I

430
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,800
absolutely love how the style looks

431
00:13:22,779 --> 00:13:25,690
especially with the shape of the eye

432
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,770
shadow that I went with today the one

433
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:29,200
thing that I will say about these lashes

434
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:31,270
that I don't love is the actual band on

435
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,070
them the style of lash is beautiful but

436
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:35,230
the band is really really thin and

437
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:36,820
flimsy now some people may like that

438
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:38,650
because it's really easy to like kind of

439
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:41,080
manipulate it but I personally prefer a

440
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:42,580
much thicker and more durable band

441
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,529
because I kind of feel like when you

442
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:46,540
come to glue it on it's a lot harder to

443
00:13:44,529 --> 00:13:47,980
work with but I feel like that works and

444
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:49,750
the fact that it won't come off as easy

445
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:50,920
whereas like now that we have a thin

446
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,779
band it's kind of just like flipping

447
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,730
around and I really had to make sure I

448
00:13:52,779 --> 00:13:56,230
like how's it on their wall gluing it on

449
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:57,940
at the end of the day it's really up to

450
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:59,920
personal preference I don't love this

451
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:02,770
lash band like I said but these lashes

452
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,540
are only retailing for $10 and with an

453
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:06,339
influencer code they are nine dollars so

454
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:08,080
it is much better than like a lily lash

455
00:14:06,339 --> 00:14:09,910
or a New Balance and watch I just I love

456
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,529
them so you guys could totally make your

457
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:13,150
own decision on that but yeah these

458
00:14:11,529 --> 00:14:14,920
lashes are beautiful just don't love the

459
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:16,660
band so those are both eyes all complete

460
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,700
I honestly love how the suck is turning

461
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:20,950
oh so far and then the eyes are done are

462
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:22,510
next up is going to be the glow and once

463
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:24,040
again for the glow I do have a first

464
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:26,260
impressions product and that is the

465
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,390
brand new Anasazi sugar

466
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:29,310
glow can I

467
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:30,420
Gazi basically chose all the favorite

468
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:32,280
highlighters from the individual

469
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:33,690
highlighter palettes before and put them

470
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,340
all together into one palette what to

471
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:36,750
think is absolutely genius it's like a

472
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:39,060
favorites palette within the actual

473
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,930
brand so that is super super dope and I

474
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,280
think if we're actually going to go

475
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:43,590
ahead and apply and mix it the shape of

476
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,450
butterscotch and starburst today for

477
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,930
this look as always I'm gonna play using

478
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:48,030
Miami

479
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:49,350
501 brush I mean this really should come

480
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:51,480
to no surprises you guys we all know

481
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:52,650
that anastacio always kill that their

482
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,910
highlighters I've been using so

483
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:56,310
Hollywood in literally every single

484
00:14:53,910 --> 00:15:02,040
video for the past like almost two years

485
00:14:56,310 --> 00:15:03,840
now but wow I'm sure these are so good

486
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,250
now that my highlight is all on I'm

487
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:07,380
gonna grab my blush brush one more time

488
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:09,720
which is my e4 and dip into the shade at

489
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:10,890
terracotta and breeze and this put a

490
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,390
little bit of this more on the

491
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:14,130
cheekbones just to kind of blend

492
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:15,570
together the highlight because I feel

493
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:18,780
like it is a little bit too pigmented

494
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:20,250
and it's not yeah a lot better there we

495
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:21,780
go I just completely didn't finish my

496
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:23,100
sentence it's a little bit too pigmented

497
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:24,750
and it's not blending together for that

498
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,010
one for the lips today I'm gonna play

499
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:28,110
the ofra liquid lipstick in the shade

500
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:29,970
Hannah Lulu as a base this was literally

501
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:31,710
the perfect lip color to use for this

502
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:33,990
look oh my god I think I'm actually

503
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:35,490
gonna take my packing brush and dip it

504
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:38,130
back into the laurel leaf I grab a

505
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:40,950
little bit of porky and in one ear

506
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:42,120
together and make this lip metallic okey

507
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:43,320
whoa adding that shadow was like

508
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,330
literally the pounce idea opera this

509
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:47,130
looks so so pretty and was literally the

510
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:49,980
easiest way to make a DIY metallic

511
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:51,420
liquid lipstick protip simple DIY if you

512
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,620
ever have a lipstick that drives down

513
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,480
matte but you want it to be metallic

514
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:56,100
just put it on let it dry it out

515
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,140
completely and then just layer over top

516
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:00,090
with a similar shade of metallic

517
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:02,790
eyeshadow and there you go super easy

518
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:04,620
and looks so so good and all that being

00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:06,180
said this look is all complete so let's

520
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,260
go ahead and finish off with a little

521
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:09,830
spritz of Urban Decay all nighter

522
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,830
setting spray

523
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,339
alright guys and that is this fall first

524
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:17,080
impressions makeup look all complete I

525
00:16:15,339 --> 00:16:19,270
absolutely love how this look turned out

526
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,529
and honestly I think I pretty much liked

527
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:22,540
almost every sync one of the products

528
00:16:20,529 --> 00:16:23,950
we've tried today which is so exciting

529
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:26,680
starting over from the beginning the no

530
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:28,450
horrible um primer there we go that's a

531
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,980
mouthful from a touchin sole was

532
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:32,529
absolutely wonderful it made my skin

533
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:34,060
feel so so good and super smooth

534
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:36,850
definitely did like a blurring effect

535
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:38,380
which I love next up we use the milk

536
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:40,720
makeup foundation and I was in the shade

537
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:42,220
golden light it was a really really good

538
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,720
match for my skin as you can see which

539
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:46,089
normally does not happen on the future

540
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,350
channel so that is great it wasn't my

541
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:48,940
favorite product in the world but it

542
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:50,380
also was my least favorite it looks

543
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:51,880
really really beautiful all the skin and

544
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:53,500
is honestly holding up really really

545
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,000
well till at least I have a little bit

546
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:57,220
of a problem start with us on my nose

547
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,660
which is like honestly a breaking point

548
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:00,520
for any foundation for me my nose

549
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:02,260
contour is super super important to me

550
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,580
and vital to my makeup routine so as

551
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:05,350
soon as a foundation it doesn't sit well

552
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:06,880
on my nose that is instantly out for me

553
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:08,470
but I feel like the pros of this

554
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,329
foundation are outweighing the cons so I

555
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:11,980
like it definitely try that for yourself

556
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:13,360
and let me know what you guys think next

557
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:15,189
up we use the Laura Lee Los Angeles

558
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,420
cat's pajamas eyes shadow palette and I

559
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:19,540
already told you guys what I think of

560
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:21,760

00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:22,900

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,650

563
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:28,360

564
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:30,280
forget it once again but we also use the

565
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:32,800
Anastacio radiant blush palette and I

566
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:34,990
use the shade coastline and terrace and

567
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,309
breeze all together so literally three

568
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:37,780
out of the four shades of the palette I

569
00:17:36,309 --> 00:17:39,550
really really like the firm of these

570
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:40,870
they blended beautifully the only thing

571
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:42,490
I will say is that they are super super

572
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:44,740
pigmented so if you check these out just

573
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:46,630
using a very very light hand because you

574
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,950

00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:49,660
