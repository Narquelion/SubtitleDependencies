139
00:07:23,349 --> 00:07:27,580
almost all the man figured it out

140
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:30,930
eventually I need to just grow the balls

141
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,930
and go up to strangers I think

142
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:07,939
I'm literally freaking out and I don't

143
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:08,930
know why I I've never been like that's

144
00:08:07,939 --> 00:08:09,889
all having a video before I don't know

145
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,779
why I'm so scared

146
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:14,479
I have no problem going up to all these

147
00:08:11,779 --> 00:08:16,159
youtubers that I know and trying to fool

148
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:17,569
them but I don't know why I cannot go up

149
00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:18,979
to some that I don't know right now but

150
00:08:17,569 --> 00:08:20,539
normally I feel like if it was me I

151
00:08:18,979 --> 00:08:22,310
could go up to anybody this video is

152
00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:23,810
getting really deep really fast for some

153
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:25,490
reason which I was not expecting and I'm

154
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:29,689
kind of scared maybe this wasn't the

155
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:31,939
best idea I feel really stupid now Kelly

156
00:08:29,689 --> 00:08:33,740
I don't wanna film anymore no I think we

157
00:08:31,939 --> 00:08:36,640
need to go home I think we thought the

158
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,640
car was addicted to go home

159
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:52,020
so I just got home I just took a shower

160
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:56,880
I am now back to regular old sister

161
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:58,740
James and today's video took a turn the

162
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,510
head I was really not expecting it to

163
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:02,490
take but it's definitely one that I

164
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:04,410
think I want to sit down and talk about

165
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:06,660
before I say anything about what kind of

166
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:09,420
just went on I first want to say a major

167
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:10,680
major thank you - Channing Judith who

168
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:13,440
was my special effects artist for

169
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:15,029
today's video she is literally so

170
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,320
incredibly talented and one of the

171
00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:20,029
nicest people I've ever met in the

172
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:22,260
entire world yes of course today's video

173
00:09:20,029 --> 00:09:24,060
did not exactly work out like I wanted

174
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:26,250
it to but it had a no correlation to the

175
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:27,779
makeup whatsoever at all it was my own

176
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,760
personal issues that we'll get into in a

177
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:31,500
second and I just want to say thank you

178
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,450
to her for taking the time out of her

179
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,940
day to make those prosthetics to mold my

180
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:38,100
face to apply that that took five hours

181
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:39,810
this morning and it was truly one of the

182
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,880
coolest processes and makeup that I've

183
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:43,170
ever been a part of and actually got me

184
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,190
so into special effects makeup I

185
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:46,170
definitely wanna do more research and

186
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:47,640
learn a lot about it but major shadows -

187
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:49,980
Channing and I also want to say a major

188
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,510
thank you as well - beautycon for their

189
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:53,490
entire team for not only hooking me and

190
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:55,709
my team up with talent passes very very

191
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:58,500
last second and also for letting us film

192
00:09:55,709 --> 00:09:59,640
that was super super awesome and this

193
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,230
concept was something that I really

194
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,370
wanted to do was super excited about so

195
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:04,860
I was really happy that they were

196
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:06,180
supportive of me as a creator to allow

197
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:09,959
me to do that in their convention today

198
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:12,120
all that being said I don't really talk

199
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:14,880
about my feelings that often on YouTube

200
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,260
I am very much an open book but usually

201
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,020
an open book of positivity and

202
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:20,040
creativity and marketing and all sorts

203
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:21,990
of things I've talked about all the time

204
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:24,750
in my videos but it's not very often

205
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:27,089
that you guys see me being vulnerable

206
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:29,910
and the truth is that I don't really

207
00:10:27,089 --> 00:10:32,279
like being a vulnerable I myself have

208
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:33,779
never before suffered with anxiety I

209
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:35,220
know a lot about it because a lot of

210
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:36,870
really important people in my life have

211
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,950
it of course I've been nervous and I've

212
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:40,800
been anxious for different things

213
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:45,450
happening but I've never really suffered

214
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:48,000
with true anxiety and today I think what

215
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:49,950
I had was an anxiety attack and I'm

216
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,140
still really confused about it I'm still

217
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:53,190
a little bit shaken up I'm still sister

218
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,500
shock there's not

219
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:57,720
time for jokes sorry but that's just how

220
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,980
I cope with these type of things and I

221
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,470
just wanted to sit down and kind of talk

222
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:03,390
to you guys about it because for the

223
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:06,780
past two or so hours on the way home

224
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:08,250
from beautycon to getting on transformed

225
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:10,410
to then taking a shower including myself

226
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:13,350
up I've been thinking a lot about why

227
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:13,740
today went how it did and how I feel

228
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:16,680
about it

229
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:18,120
and I think I've actually been able to

230
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:21,510
successfully kind of like really dig

231
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:23,070
into why I was sort of nerve-wracking

232
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:24,810
and I just wanted to talk to you guys

233
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:26,690
about it in case anybody else has a

234
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:29,160
similar situation a similar scenario

235
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:31,170
because the city was supposed to start

236
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,430
off for a very light-hearted a super

237
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:34,080
positive I wanted to start off by going

238
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:35,370
into the convention and and having

239
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,870
different influencers that seeing if my

240
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:38,190
friends recognized me and then

241
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:39,750
eventually going to bunch of the

242
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:41,100
different brands talking to brands on

243
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:43,380
who their influencers that they love

244
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:45,660
working with were asking if I myself

245
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,920
Steve could be on PR lists I really

246
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,570
wanted to go into the public area

247
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:51,420
beautycon didn't really talk to fans but

248
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:54,710
for some reason when I walked into just

249
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:57,030
the backstage kind of like talent area I

250
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:58,470
something came over me and I was even

251
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:59,820
experiencing this in the car on the way

252
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:02,070
there I was really really nervous but

253
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:03,420
something came over me once I walked in

254
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:05,160
that was like a feeling probably the

255
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:07,770
most similar feeling that I've ever

256
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:11,130
experienced this and was when I landed

257
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:12,780
in Africa after the Ebola scandal like I

258
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:14,130
saying beauty Khanna was in on this

259
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:15,300
video I had told them a few days ago

260
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:16,680
that I was going to do this they gave me

261
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,420
the okay which I was super appreciative

262
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,070
of the first step of my video of course

263
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:22,380
was to talk to different influencers

264
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:24,720
that I knew because all of them know me

265
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:27,390
very very very well all then pretty much

266
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,440
caught on quickly which was funny but

267
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:30,480
also was a little bit disheartening

268
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,490
because I really really tried to hide

269
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,660
myself almost every single of them said

270
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,860
that it was my boys that gave it away

271
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,210
which of course me and Jenny were

272
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,260
talking about earlier we knew is this

273
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:39,390
gonna be anything that was gonna give it

274
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:41,580
away it will be my voice let's be real

275
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:43,440
the space can be transformed but the

276
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:44,760
Salang s voice is not going anywhere no

277
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,230
matter how much I try to change it no

278
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,060
matter how much I deepen it no matter

279
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:50,580
what country I try to pretend like I'm

280
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:52,530
from it's me and it gave it away pretty

281
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:54,180
quickly which already kind of put me in

282
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:55,890
a weirdest mood going into it I got a

283
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:57,300
little bit discouraged but I was so

284
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:58,440
ready to go super excited I think it's

285
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,510
kind of got a little bit awkward and

286
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,950
escalated for me personally once I sat

287
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:03,930
down and talked to my really good friend

288
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:05,700
Nikita dragon now me and Nikita have

289
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:06,160
been friends for literally three years

290
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,420
now she

291
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,040
probably one of the first influences I

292
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:10,240
ever met I remember going to my first

293
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,620
ever gem duty like I was talking about

294
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,760
in the last video and Nikita was so

295
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:14,680
sweet to me she invited me to her

296
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,210
birthday party that night and I couldn't

297
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:18,160
go because I was underage but she was

298
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:19,480
just super super welcoming and Nikita

299
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,440
and I have grown really really close

300
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,750
over the past few years we tell each

301
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:25,120
other everything I know her family so

302
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:26,530
what I went up to her I'd actually made

303
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,390
eye contact with Naheed his mom and she

304
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:29,590
kind of made a face like I know this

305
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:31,330
person but I don't know this person so I

306
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:33,160
was like Shh so she knew something was

307
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:35,650
up and when I went to sit down with her

308
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:37,720
Nikita I know figured it out right away

309
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:40,600
but Nikita if you know her is very

310
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:42,700
playful she loves drama she loves acting

311
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,990
she's super super funny so when I sat

312
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,850
down with her to ask her if I could

313
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:47,380
interview her she was like oh yes of

314
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:49,000
course and she knew exactly what was

315
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:50,350
going on but her management team was

316
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,120
like oh no we're not doing any questions

317
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:54,010
right now and Nikita's assistant was

318
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:56,080
also right there and she sought me a

319
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:57,520
super super nasty look because I knew

320
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,410
Nikita knew what was going on I kept

321
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:01,150
talking to her and because I'm so close

322
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:03,040
to Nikita I was getting closer to her

323
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:04,630
and asking her questions even though

324
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,340
both her manager team and her assistant

325
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:08,020
told me to stop which is totally my

326
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:09,280
fault for not realizing like Hello

327
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:11,710
they're not supposed to know that it's

328
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:13,000
me looking at now I am so glad that that

329
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:15,370
happened because I was a very very

330
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,170
creepy looking busted crusted dusted man

331
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:18,820
asking very very forceful questions

332
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:20,470
which should not be happening to anybody

333
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:22,060
in the entire world and I'm really

334
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:23,560
really glad that Nikita had a publicist

335
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,700
and a security guard there to be like

336
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,470
get out of here Krause

337
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:30,580
we're now stopped talking to my client

338
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:33,010
but in the moment because I myself was

339
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:35,140
still James in a different body per se

340
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:36,610
it was a very very uncomfortable moment

341
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,690
for me of course once things started

342
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:39,040
escalating and Nikita told them what was

343
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:41,410
going on and we all laughed about it and

344
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,550
it was fine but it still kind of left a

345
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:44,110
weird feeling in my stomach and after

346
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:46,870
Nikita I moved on to a few different

347
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:48,190
smaller influencers that I have seen on

348
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:50,740
my explore page and that I know by name

349
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:52,690
but I've never really met in person and

350
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,770
don't have like a close relationship

351
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:55,300
with that that make sense

352
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:58,930
I was ardent control but these

353
00:14:55,300 --> 00:15:00,760
conversations is what really masses my

354
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:03,220
head really badly and made me want to

355
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:04,960
leave so bad and kind of ruin the whole

356
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:06,190
thing of course I was able to pull a few

357
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,810
people who didn't quite catch on at

358
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:09,220
first and a Rubens mate who's another

359
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:10,900
really little boy and makeup was

360
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:12,460
literally saying the sweetest things

361
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:14,230
about me I need to not even realize I

362
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:17,020
literally adore him he is so sweet and

363
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:18,640
that made my day so so so much but

364
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,640
unfortunately his conversation was

365
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,410
probably the first one

366
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:24,769
out of all the influences that I talked

367
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:26,690
to after that and they were not like

368
00:15:24,769 --> 00:15:28,070
that at all I'm not including I need the

369
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:29,600
footage in this video because the point

370
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:30,589
of this was not to expose anybody or

371
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,420
start drama it was literally a

372
00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:33,019
light-hearted video that unfortunately

373
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:36,320
had a turn

374
00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:38,060
but like 90% of the influencers that I

375
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,810
went up to trying to ask interview

376
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:44,390
questions with were so beyond rude and

377
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:47,149
so nasty and me it definitely was a

378
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:50,390
little bit of an ego trip which I will

379
00:15:47,149 --> 00:15:51,649
100% admit because me as someone who was

380
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:53,750
already scared to this video in the

381
00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:56,600
first place was walking around a beauty

382
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:58,760
convention with a camera woman and a

383
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,350
writer and a microphone and that was it

384
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,790
while a lot of these fellow influencers

385
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:03,410
that had like 100,000 followers that

386
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:04,880
have talked so poorly about me in the

387
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:05,750
past but I still want to interview

388
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,060
because I thought it would be good for

389
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:10,339
the video had full security teams around

390
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:12,410
them which I found a little bit strange

391
00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:14,660
and when I went up to them trying to ask

392
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:16,250
them if they would do the interview it

393
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:18,620
was either the info to themselves being

394
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:20,029
very very nasty and keep in mind gasps

395
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:22,760
of course I'm like crusty just did

396
00:16:20,029 --> 00:16:24,589
busted old man asking a young kid to do

397
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:26,329
an interview it's okay to say no I do

398
00:16:24,589 --> 00:16:28,339
not blame them but it could have been a

399
00:16:26,329 --> 00:16:29,829
simple no thank you I don't have time

400
00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:33,649
right now but it's easier than being

401
00:16:29,829 --> 00:16:34,910
really really nasty or their security

402
00:16:33,649 --> 00:16:38,630
guard which they definitely do not need

403
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:40,430
being also nasty as well it was just a

404
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:41,510
weird situation I'm gonna be honest when

405
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:42,829
I'm saying this and I know that I get a

406
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:44,540
lot of comments about this so I kind of

407
00:16:42,829 --> 00:16:46,100
want to explain where I'm coming from

408
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:47,240
because I never address this and I

409
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:50,110
always just delete the comments cuz I

410
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:55,970
find it annoying but I do understand why

411
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:58,670
this experiment was a major ego check

412
00:16:55,970 --> 00:17:04,819
for me but also a confidence check for

413
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:07,250
me and my confidence comes from my work

414
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:08,390
which has built my reputation when I

415
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:10,760
first when the beauty industry a few

416
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:12,620
years ago I was a boy of course and I

417
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:14,390
was also sixteen years old so because of

418
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:15,949
that a lot of people already didn't take

419
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:17,419
me seriously and those are factors

420
00:17:15,949 --> 00:17:19,040
obviously that I cannot control but

421
00:17:17,419 --> 00:17:20,750
there's also a lot of things that I

422
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:22,640
could control that were my own fault

423
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:24,799
that kind of ruined my reputation in the

424
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,600
industry very very early on I got

425
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,829
involved with a lot of drama I fought

426
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:30,320
with a lot of different influencers of

427
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:32,540
course now that I'm okay with but a lot

428
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,370
of influencers and because

429
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,690
that a lot of influencers of course work

430
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:38,390
very closely with brands which you guys

431
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:40,910
all know so I lost out on a lot of huge

432
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:42,410
branded opportunities and I also had of

433
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:44,120
course we all know those a lot of

434
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:45,020
scandals as well so despite the fact

435
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:47,330
that I was gaining followers pretty

436
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:48,260
quickly from viral posts I didn't

437
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:50,420
exactly have the best reputation

438
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:52,190
internally and although I was getting

439
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:53,840
hate online what I truly care about is

440
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:55,310
the people around me and that's always

441
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,390
than have a person that I'd been on

442
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:57,350
Twitter and Instagram when I was first

443
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:59,210
starting off there were so many

444
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:00,440
influencers that I was once really close

445
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,700
friends with and then the next day on

446
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,290
Twitter they'd be tweeting about how I

447
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,820
was a horrible person because they saw

448
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:07,340
scandal and they wanted to join in and

449
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:09,080
be a part of that bandwagon or so many

450
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:10,160
parties that I would go to and talk to

451
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,270
people that I thought were my friend and

452
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,250
then they would end up talking about me

453
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:14,750
badly on snapchat that same night behind

454
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,820
my back well I guess not behind my back

455
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:18,530
in front of millions of people I guess

456
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:19,700
early on I did not I just didn't have

457
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:22,040
the best experience coming into the

458
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:24,050
industry and it's something that I've

459
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,880
had to kind of deal with and fix those

460
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:28,010
relationships and also build back my

461
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:30,200
reputation through hard work over the

462
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:31,550
past three years a long time ago when I

463
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,350
kind of have this like a reality check

464
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:35,750
of oh my god James you're getting into

465
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:37,550
so much drama like stop I had really had

466
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:39,560
to make a mental note to get away from

467
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:41,090
it and stop saying things about people

468
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,920
and stop talking about other people and

469
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:45,380
stop being shady and rude it's just

470
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:47,090
unnecessary and one of my ways to kind

471
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:48,560
of cope with that and to fix it was to

472
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:50,330
kind of take a step back from the beauty

473
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:52,190
community and really focus on my true

474
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:53,480
friends outside of the industry and not

475
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:55,130
really attend many events and not do

476
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,270
that many brand deals anymore and that's

477
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:58,940
kind of the way that I have ruled for

478
00:18:56,270 --> 00:19:00,290
the past probably year or so I'm just

479
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:02,540
like really private with my team and the

480
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:04,300
people that I love the most but today

481
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:06,920
kind of reminded me exactly why I

482
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:10,160
stopped going to those events because

483
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:12,110
just the feeling and the air and the

484
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,540
attitude and the egos and the

485
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:17,000
entitlement from some of the people you

486
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:17,900
can just tell that it's just a I don't

487
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,430
even know how to explain it to you grace

488
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:23,420
it's just a feeling that you get you

489
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:25,430
just feel like you're not wanted in a

490
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:29,210
room and that your presence to somebody

491
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:32,150
else is not taken seriously for their

492
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:34,730
sake I just hope that like myself they

493
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:36,650
realize how ugly it is and will try to

494
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:37,940
turn that around because take it from me

495
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:40,340
as someone who has been down that path

496
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:43,190
you will have to do a lot of work to fix

497
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:44,660
that one day and that work is not fun

498
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:45,230
because of both things that I couldn't

499
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,580
control

500
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:48,049
my age but also things that were

501
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:51,020
hundred-percent my faults such as my

502
00:19:48,049 --> 00:19:53,330
scandals and also my dramatic attitude

503
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:54,590
in the beginning I've had to work twice

504
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:57,440
as hard as everybody else for the past

505
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:58,880
three years to build up a reputation to

506
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,559
show people that I'm not a horrible kid

507
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,510
and to show people that I do have talent

508
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:04,190
and that I want to work hard and that I

509
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:06,440
deserve to be where I am today and I

510
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:08,090
know that I always preach this as well

511
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,040
like move silently and let her success

512
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:11,720
speak for herself but I will admit that

513
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,760
that's always a battle that I've had a

514
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,870
fight internally and I of course do

515
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,610
always catch myself and I try to stay

516
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:19,970
humble and I try to really put my ego

517
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:22,370
aside but it's not really me thinking

518
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:26,240
that I'm the best and thinking that like

519
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:28,910
I'm the queen it's me defending that

520
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:32,059
position because of the fact that I had

521
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:34,370
so many things working against me when I

522
00:20:32,059 --> 00:20:36,470
first started and I think that that

523
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:37,880
saying that I really realized today and

524
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:40,790
saying that I kind of need to get over

525
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:42,620
in my existence to really not depend on

526
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:44,960
my reputation because at the end of the

527
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:46,490
day I love what I do and I worked so

528
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,660
hard for what I do and they'll always be

529
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:49,760
people following and supporting me no

530
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:51,080
matter what and I think this has been a

531
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:54,860
really great you go check for me because

532
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:56,240
I quickly realized that today was

533
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:58,429
triggered for me because it wasn't me

534
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:01,040
James Charles is confident I love myself

535
00:20:58,429 --> 00:21:02,390
I am so happy around my fans and around

536
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,700
strangers I can be bubbly I can be

537
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:07,160
myself I am not ashamed of that and I

538
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:08,570
love Who I am and I can talk to anybody

539
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,679
and that's why I do my shaders doing

540
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:11,480
makeup videos because they're so much

541
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,669
fun and they get to travel in new places

542
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:16,040
and experience new people and also me

543
00:21:13,669 --> 00:21:18,169
you says his along the way but for some

544
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:20,210
reason today having to play a different

545
00:21:18,169 --> 00:21:21,890
persona and to kind of hide everything

546
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:26,150
that I've worked over the past few years

547
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:27,919
to show people was so weird and I could

548
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:30,919
not do it and it was literally like

549
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:33,200
taking my persona of talking fast of

550
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:34,640
using their hands and having their nails

551
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,200
on and having their Julia that they've

552
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,059
worked hours and hours and hours of

553
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,919
sleepless nights for and being able to

554
00:21:38,059 --> 00:21:41,360
wear a full face of makeup and sow their

555
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,190
hair really nicely and have cute clothes

556
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,429
and also not having to throw that all

557
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:47,990
away to having nobody know who I am have

558
00:21:46,429 --> 00:21:51,110
nobody know what I've worked for what I

559
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:53,240
stand for and having to be a totally

560
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:55,520
different person who was literally polar

561
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:58,820
opposite of myself

562
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:01,280
I I could not do it it it was weird

563
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:03,350
and I felt generally trapped under all

564
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:06,440
that makeup and all that hair and that

565
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:09,860
beard and I felt like I was literally

566
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:11,900
becoming Steve who nobody knew and a lot

567
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:14,630
of people were tweeting very very poorly

568
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:15,890
and it kind of brought me back to how I

569
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:17,690
was feeling in the beginning of the

570
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:21,920
industry feeling very very unwelcomed

571
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:23,210
feeling unliked feeling unwanted and my

572
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:25,520
brain started running at a million miles

573
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:26,929
per hour and that's kind of where the

574
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,070
anxiety attack came from and that's why

575
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:31,520
I needed to get out of that situation

576
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:33,740
and get that makeup off and come back as

577
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,630
me and not because I needed to feel

578
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:39,170
famous or because I needed the attention

579
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:40,880
but because I have worked so hard over

580
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:41,840
the past few years to fix myself I'm not

581
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,000
even gonna stop talking because it's

582
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,230
Aaron I have worked so hard to decks

583
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,090
that reputation and really show people

584
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:49,610
my true colors and show people that I am

585
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:51,080
a good person and show people that I do

586
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:52,730
have so much love in my heart and I know

587
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,690
that that should come across naturally

588
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:56,809
and it's not saying that I should worry

589
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:58,070
about or care about but I can't sit here

590
00:22:56,809 --> 00:23:00,260
pretend like at something that is

591
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:03,140
bothering to me because it really is I

592
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:06,140
do care about how people think of me and

593
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:08,000
how people look at me and I wish I could

594
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:10,130
say that I did it I'm sure we all do and

595
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,990
I do have a very very thick skin that I

596
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:13,010
have had to build because I was forced

597
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:15,559
to grow up in an industry very very

598
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:17,480
quickly but at the end of the day it

599
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:20,660
still does get to me from time to time

600
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:22,120
and it's something that I've had to deal

601
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:26,030
with it's been a constant battle

602
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:28,340
internally and a lot of the battle was a

603
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:30,050
hundred percent my fault and I know that

604
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:32,230
and I'm okay with that

605
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:34,760
but it's been a hard battle to fight and

606
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:35,990
it's been a battle that I finally felt

607
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:39,260
like within the past few months I

608
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:43,309
started to win and today all the sudden

609
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:45,260
I went back to square one and it was

610
00:23:43,309 --> 00:23:46,490
like losing the battle altogether at the

611
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:48,200
end of the day although this experience

612
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:50,179
was very very hard for me to go through

613
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:54,110
I think I learned three very very

614
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:55,880
valuable lessons one being I myself now

615
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:57,559
need to really fight this internal

616
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:59,090
battle more than ever of not only

617
00:23:57,559 --> 00:24:01,190
letting my success really speak for

618
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:04,610
herself and not having to worry about my

619
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:07,149
reputation but really not letting my

620
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:09,279
confidence come from my work

621
00:24:07,149 --> 00:24:10,749
really looking back at today I'm not

622
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:13,509
realizing that I do have a major issue

623
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:15,099
of that and a lot of my confidence does

624
00:24:13,509 --> 00:24:16,809
come from the fact that I've had a fight

625
00:24:15,099 --> 00:24:18,309
to get to where I am today and it feels

626
00:24:16,809 --> 00:24:19,809
like a battle that I finally won and

627
00:24:18,309 --> 00:24:21,129
whenever you win of course you feel

628
00:24:19,809 --> 00:24:23,320
really really powerful you feel great

629
00:24:21,129 --> 00:24:24,639
and you feel just on top of the world

630
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,690
and that's what I've been feeling the

631
00:24:24,639 --> 00:24:27,489
past few months because you guys are

632
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:29,109
always so supportive of me and you guys

633
00:24:27,489 --> 00:24:30,639
are really enjoying my content and that

634
00:24:29,109 --> 00:24:31,960
makes me so proud as a content creator

635
00:24:30,639 --> 00:24:35,289
and I feel like we've won that battle

636
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:37,809
together but I don't want my internal

637
00:24:35,289 --> 00:24:39,039
confidence to come from that battle

638
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:40,809
I need that confidence to come from

639
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,399
self-love and that's something that I

640
00:24:40,809 --> 00:24:44,649
will be working on definitely after

641
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:47,679
filming this video today because that's

642
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:50,109
bad and it shouldn't be that way too

643
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:52,059
I kind of really experienced a lesson

644
00:24:50,109 --> 00:24:53,889
that I had learned many many years ago

645
00:24:52,059 --> 00:24:55,539
very very early on that I thought

646
00:24:53,889 --> 00:24:59,349
everybody else was on the same page as

647
00:24:55,539 --> 00:25:00,970
but I was clearly wrong and that is that

648
00:24:59,349 --> 00:25:03,070
no matter who you're talking to you

649
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:04,599
always need to be polite no matter who

650
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:06,429
they are what they look like what their

651
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:07,509
size is what their color is what their

652
00:25:06,429 --> 00:25:09,220
makeup looks like what their hair looks

653
00:25:07,509 --> 00:25:11,019
like because you never know who you're

654
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:12,039
really talking to it you never know who

655
00:25:11,019 --> 00:25:13,029
so much related to be never know who

656
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:14,950
someone's working with and you never

657
00:25:13,029 --> 00:25:16,840
know what opportunities or what

658
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:19,989
friendship someone could bring you in

659
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:21,279
the future and as it influencer in the

660
00:25:19,989 --> 00:25:22,629
space take me out of the equation

661
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:24,340
because I would say the same thing to

662
00:25:22,629 --> 00:25:25,809
any other smaller influencer there were

663
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:27,549
a lot of really small influencers today

664
00:25:25,809 --> 00:25:29,859
that I have loved and I thought were so

665
00:25:27,549 --> 00:25:32,139
talented and that were so incredibly

666
00:25:29,859 --> 00:25:34,269
rude and those people relationship with

667
00:25:32,139 --> 00:25:35,379
me that could be very valuable to them

668
00:25:34,269 --> 00:25:36,820
or it could be a really great friend to

669
00:25:35,379 --> 00:25:37,899
them I love making new friends I'm a

670
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:40,809
pretty good person if I do say so myself

671
00:25:37,899 --> 00:25:41,919
and I've done the same thing early on to

672
00:25:40,809 --> 00:25:43,799
a lot of different people and I ruined a

673
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:46,659
lot of relationships and friendships and

674
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:49,029
reputations being my own that I had a

675
00:25:46,659 --> 00:25:51,190
fix for a very very long time so I

676
00:25:49,029 --> 00:25:53,769
really hope that that's a lesson that a

677
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:56,200
lot of people were able to take from

678
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:57,669
this video because it's a valuable one

679
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,779
and you should always treat people how

680
00:25:57,669 --> 00:26:00,220
you want to be treated that's something

681
00:25:58,779 --> 00:26:01,479
that I have really taught myself to live

682
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:03,549
by within the past few years of the

683
00:26:01,479 --> 00:26:06,340
beauty community because it's a

684
00:26:03,549 --> 00:26:07,509
dog-eat-dog world and at the end of the

685
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:09,669
day you just need to be supportive of

686
00:26:07,509 --> 00:26:10,809
everyone because we're all in the same

687
00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:12,700
business that we're all fighting

688
00:26:10,809 --> 00:26:16,210
together and last but finally not least

689
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:18,659
three I learned that I should never ever

690
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:20,190
in my entire life love

691
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:23,340
facial hair grow out to a full beard

692
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:25,409
because it looks the absolute worst all

693
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:26,669
right guys I think that is all I have

694
00:26:25,409 --> 00:26:28,349
for this video silly I hope you enjoyed

695
00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:29,999
this kind of more like one on one

696
00:26:28,349 --> 00:26:32,039
conversation I don't really do this very

697
00:26:29,999 --> 00:26:33,779
often and like I was saying it's because

698
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:34,859
I don't really like coming across as

699
00:26:33,779 --> 00:26:36,599
vulnerable

700
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:37,710
I like being really positive I like

701
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:41,970
inspiring you guys I like making you

702
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:43,049
guys happy and this stuff for me is

703
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:45,539
saying that I don't really talking about

704
00:26:43,049 --> 00:26:48,509
but at the end of the day if it could

705
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:49,799
help anybody that's why I want to talk

706
00:26:48,509 --> 00:26:51,479
about it and I really hope you guys were

707
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:53,940
able to learn stuff lesson from this

708
00:26:51,479 --> 00:26:56,489
video because lord knows I did that I

from the drama to the internal battle of

722
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:21,479
having to work my way up to where I am

723
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:23,309
