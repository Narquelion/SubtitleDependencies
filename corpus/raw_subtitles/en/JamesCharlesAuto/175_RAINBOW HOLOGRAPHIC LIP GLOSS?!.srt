00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:07,589
hi sisters James Charles here and

2
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:08,519
welcome back to my youtube channel for

3
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:09,360
today's video I'm gonna be doing

4
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:10,590
something completely different that I

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,450
have never done on this channel before

6
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:15,120
and I'm honestly so excited for and I

7
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,830
hope you guys are too in case you miss

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,680
it or been living under a rock

9
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:22,050
Sigma just relaunched their lip switched

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,930
lip glosses that is such a mouthful but

11
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:27,420
these lip glosses are like holographic

12
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:30,060
rainbow glosses like ass and they aren't

13
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,199
so beyond beautiful they launched a few

14
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,329
months back and they took the internet

15
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,040
by storm everybody was doing a crazy

16
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:37,050
looks at them and they sold out and have

17
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,700
not been available since it's been like

18
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,170
3 or 4 months but they finally just

19
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,210
relaunched a few days ago and now I got

20
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,219
my hands on all four of the shades as

21
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,450
soon as I got these I was so freaking

22
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:46,890
excited and my first instinct was

23
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,260
obviously to open them right up and do

24
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,100
some swatches over on snapchat and if

25
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,420
you don't follow me on SAP you

26
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,280
definitely shed when you save as James

27
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,500
Charles and then extra ass after Charles

28
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,610
I was do PR on boxes and openings on

29
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,039
there than when I did get products like

30
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:00,480
these they're always getting swatched as

31
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,180
soon as I got these in swatch if I

32
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,489
wanted to do a look so so badly because

33
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:08,159
they were so cool so goo does this like

34
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:10,530
black smokey eye glossy lid and rainbow

35
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,350
lip situation post it on Instagram and

36
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,760
you guys went crazy over it I got so

37
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:16,500
many comments and so many requests to

38
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,820
film a video on this look and reality

39
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,650
it's literally just a black lip and

40
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,930
black smokey eye with these glosses over

41
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:23,640
tough anybody can do that it's just the

42
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,780
gloss I guess that are the cool part so

43
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,400
instead of doing like a tutorial because

44
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,170
I feel like that's boring and it's super

45
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,180
super easy I want to do like a full-on

46
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,530
type of like review swatch type of

47
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,630
situation and then I'll pour see how I

48
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,009
created their lips from the look the

49
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,329
gloves the eye part is so much fun and

50
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:38,189
photographs beautifully but it's

51
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:40,259
definitely not from practical wear at

52
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:41,820
all trust me I was like blinking and

53
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:43,799
glosses getting all my eye lids after

54
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,780
like three three minutes so definitely

55
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,340
would not recommend so I figured I would

56
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,439
just skip out on the eyes and do only

57
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,450
the lips for today that further ado

58
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,829
let's get into the review I just pulled

59
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:54,899
up the signal website right now and

60
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:57,750
these are the lip switch lip glosses

61
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:59,939
from Sigma Beauty they are $14 each

62
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,380
definitely not too badly price for a lip

63
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:03,360
gloss I know most lip glosses are

64
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,680
usually like 18 or 21 dollars similar

65
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,120
price

66
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,520
they're sick so you are definitely

67
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,869
getting a few dollars off for sure

68
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,500
it describes on the website as a

69
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:14,330
holographic lipgloss is that a prismatic

70
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:17,750
lightweight and a d-dimensional new

71
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:20,300
layer tier favorite lip color these lips

72
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:22,550
which lip glosses come in four different

73
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:29,420
shades the first one is called flip flop

74
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:31,700
and this one is orange holographic the

75
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:37,459
next lips which is called pink lotus and

76
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:39,110
is basically pink holographic next one

77
00:02:37,459 --> 00:02:45,890
is called it transcend and it is this

78
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:47,420
blue holographic gloss and the last one

79
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:50,810
is called a double whammy and it is this

80
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:56,959
purple blue green trio chrome gloss type

81
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:57,860
of situation so those are all four

82
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,450
shades swatched

83
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,620
on the skin and I don't really know how

84
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:02,360
these are gonna show up on camera

85
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:04,370
looking at the monitor you can't really

86
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,620
tell how actually holographic in here it

87
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:08,299
doesn't they look and person they are so

88
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,680
beautiful and really color changing I'm

89
00:03:08,299 --> 00:03:12,350
really really hoping that it looks okay

90
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,670
on the footage but anyways envelopes it

91
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:15,200
does say that the glosses look the

92
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:16,790
coolest when they're layered over a dark

93
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,560
liquid lipstick and of course I have a

94
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:19,670
nude on right now so I'm going to go

95
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,590
ahead and remove this and replace it

96
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:23,540
with a black one then do some cool lip

97
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:24,650
swatches on the actual lips I'm gonna

98
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,970
show you guys how to created that oil

99
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:27,650
spell look that I post it on the

100
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:29,030
Instagram everybody was crazy over it is

101
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:30,320
such a cool look still let's go ahead

102
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:31,280
and take this liquid lipstick off and

103
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,019
I'll show you guys what these glosses

104
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,130
can really do alright so I just went

105
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:36,110
ahead and applied my favorite black

106
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:38,060
liquid lipstick I use jeffree star a

107
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:39,350
weirdo for this particular day and I'm

108
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,430
not gonna go to these glosses and crank

109
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:42,110
this oil slick

110
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:43,549
the first thing they're going to go on

111
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:45,890
with this double whammy and this is the

112
00:03:43,549 --> 00:03:47,630
purpley blue green holographic one out

113
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:50,000
of the four one this is probably my

114
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:51,260
least favorite um before I really it's

115
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,070
not as pigmented it doesn't really show

116
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:54,440
up as well

117
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:55,730
but it does make a good transition color

118
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,930
to kind of blend all the other ones

119
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:58,400
together and help create those like

120
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:00,140
inner colors like the orcs and the

121
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,180
greens so I'm going to do this one first

122
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:04,180
when I go to play this I'm gonna kind of

123
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:08,620
or there I'm not gonna go to the pink

124
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,450
lotus and put this on at the outer

125
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:17,200
corner once again same situation car

126
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:18,430
being a lot of gloss I'm gonna I'm just

127
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:26,350
going in super randomly and placing this

128
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:27,610
on it different areas next gonna grab

129
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,560
the shade it transcend and I'm gonna

130
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:31,360
layer this on as well out of the four of

131
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,850
them this one is probably my favorite I

132
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,750
feel like it's so pigmented and you can

133
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,130
oh yeah

134
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:39,540
you can really you can really see that

135
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:39,540
on camera thank God

136
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:57,780
then I'm also gonna go flip-flop and

137
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:59,730
layer that on as well all right guys and

138
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:02,580
this is how I created the oil slick lips

139
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:03,570
they look so freaking cool I really

140
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,890
really hope that the camera is like

141
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,120
doing it justice I can see on the

142
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:07,920
monitor that they definitely look very

143
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,480
very involved and person they look

144
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:12,210
literally out of this world

145
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,560
holographic rainbow realness being that

146
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,610
these glasses are only 14 does I would

147
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,370
definitely say that these products are

148
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:19,050
James Charles approved they are so cool

149
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:20,610
you definitely did not need to wear all

150
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:22,830
four of them stocked over a black

151
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:24,030
lipstick like I am these do look really

152
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:25,440
really cool on their own and could look

153
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:27,000
really really great over just a nude lip

154
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,740
or any other colored lip that you might

155
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,940
