00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:08,580
hi sisters James Charles here and

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:09,750
welcome back to my youtube channel so it

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,639
has been a hot moment since I've

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,170
uploaded on my youtube channel I am so

5
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:14,549
sorry if you guys can follow me on

6
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,160
Instagram and snapchat you would know

7
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:19,289
that I just actually finally after a

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,330
million years graduated once and for all

9
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:23,250
I did technically graduate early a few

10
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,660
months back but I just went home back to

11
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,730
New York for the first time into four or

12
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,170
five months since actually moving to

13
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,029
California and I walk to the rest of my

14
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:32,489
class for my graduation and it was kind

15
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:33,960
of iconic normally what I know I'm gonna

16
00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:36,180
travel I agree film videos for you guys

17
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,410
but this time I had a lot of really

18
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,760
exciting meetings and stuff going on

19
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:40,739
beforehand for products that'll be

20
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,480
coming out soon so I didn't get a chance

21
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:44,820
to pre film but I promise when you find

22
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,350
out what I've been doing on the DL it'll

23
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,670
be worth that well it was an amazing

24
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,110
trip I was definitely ready for it to be

25
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,239
over with by at the end of it and I

26
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:53,309
definitely missed being on my la a grind

27
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:54,840
working every single day so I'm finally

28
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:56,610
back home and I decided to sit down and

29
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,230
film a video for you guys today I

30
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:59,550
tweeted asking you guys what you wanted

31
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:01,079
to see because I wasn't really feeling

32
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:03,180
any makeup inspiration at the current

33
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,280
moment and so many of you guys had to do

34
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,060
a a Q&A now you guys know I'm pretty

35
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,799
much an open book

36
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,630
I am so open and honest with everything

37
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:10,740
that goes on in my life y'all basically

38
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,360
know every single aspect of it

39
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,100
especially if you are a loyal snap fan

40
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,290
follower so I kind of was do something a

41
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,869
little bit different so for today's Q&A

42
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,770
I thought I would do a Q&A based on what

43
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:21,360
it's like being a social-media

44
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:23,430
influencer in questions that nobody

45
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,110
really wants to answer I tweeted asking

46
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,790
you guys to send me harsh honest and

47
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,950
hard questions to answer and I actually

48
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,420
got so many cool ones so I'm super

49
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,740
excited for this and we're gonna talk

50
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,900
about everything from how much money I

51
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,610
make to I like meeting fans weirdest

52
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,570
experiences and everything under the Sun

53
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:38,670
of what it's like to be a social-media

54
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,960
influencer so if you want to hear what I

55
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,670
have to say on this and answer some

56
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,520
really really honest question make sure

57
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:46,350
you keep on watching Laci asked are most

58
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,729
beauty gurus / social media influencers

59
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,619
a lot different in real life than they

60
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:52,200
present themselves on a camera okay so

61
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:54,149
yes and no for the most part beauty

62
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,100
gurus everybody is like the exact same

63
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:57,899
as they are on camera in real life if

64
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,310
anything we just make a lot more jokes

65
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:00,659
and can be a lot more ourselves because

66
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,210
we kind of understand what goes on

67
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:05,490
within the actual industry but for other

68
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,120
social media areas of like the spectrum

69
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:09,550
in different careers and stuff I

70
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,990
say more no I've met a lot of people

71
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:12,970
that are in the beauty industry that are

72
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:15,040
so completely different as they are on

73
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:16,360
camera in real life but never in like a

74
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,280
way that I've been it disappointed or

75
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,260
upset it's just mostly in a way to like

76
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,570
protect their image and to like keep

77
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,990
their audience satisfied if that makes

78
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:24,730
sense

79
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:25,930
Loie asked are you ever cautious about

80
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:27,940
surrounding yourself with people from

81
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:30,370
the industry like seeing the beef / dawa

82
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:32,530
24/7 online it doesn't make you guarded

83
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:34,360
abso-fucking-lutely they're like maybe

84
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:36,490
three people total this industry that I

85
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,710
actually trust I have a lot of super

86
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:40,000
super close friends but it's so sad to

87
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:41,920
say that you can never really really

88
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,930
trust anybody so I am super careful of

89
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,220
who I really trust and talk to I think

90
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:47,320
finding that group of people that you

91
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:49,180
can really really trust is super super

92
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,440
important in this industry as many of

93
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,480
you guys know watching from an outside

94
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,970
perspective this industry is crazy and

95
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,260
has so much horrifying drama so it's

96
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:57,340
really really important to find their

97
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,350
cup of people that you know you could

98
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,750
love and trust and always look to when

99
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:03,910
times get tough because trust me they do

100
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,080
we can ask when people are sponsored and

101
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:07,270
they say it's their honest opinion of

102
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,410
the product is it actually no obviously

103
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,760
it's gonna depend on the person you're

104
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:12,100
watching I can only speak for myself

105
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,020
here but in my case yes it is always

106
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,730
honest if you guys look through my email

107
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,200
and saw the amount of money and offers

108
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:19,060
that is given on a daily basis you would

109
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,100
probably be freaking shook to the core

110
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:23,620
so many brands reach out to social media

111
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:25,870
influencers about campaigns but I reject

112
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,100
actually like 90% of them I'm very very

113
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:28,300
blessed and thankful to have you guys

114
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,400
and have a lot of different sources of

115
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:32,260
income from all across nine platforms so

116
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,370
for me and many other influencers brand

117
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,110
deals are not saying that it's like

118
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:37,030
super vital to me to be waiting for the

119
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:39,370
next paycheck however the ones that I do

120
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:40,840
do are the ones that I actually really

121
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:42,010
do care about so if I do like the

122
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,810
product I will definitely do the brand

123
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:45,400
deal take the money for and give an open

124
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:46,840
and honest review so if somebody's

125
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,400
reviewing a product is usually because

126
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,959
they genuinely do like it I definitely

127
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,430
did get twisted sometimes between some

128
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:53,260
people but like I said I could only

129
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:54,580
really speak for myself here so if you

130
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:56,350
guys are seeing your review product and

131
00:03:54,580 --> 00:04:00,730
say that I like it and if I'm being paid

132
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:04,570
obviously I do like it because I'm like

133
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:05,920
it what Dan asked has dating changed a

134
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:08,230
lot for you since you've gotten so big

135
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,850
and two boys treat you differently you

136
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:11,620
guys know that boys and dating a tunnel

137
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,720
has never really been a strong suit of

138
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,940
mine or like a

139
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,200
I'm pretty bad at it so it hasn't really

140
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:18,360
changed in the fact that I'm still

141
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,130
single as [ __ ] however I have noticed a

142
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:22,350
lot more guy type of social-climbing me

143
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:23,910
which is so sad and so like gross to

144
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,930
even think about but I've just learned

145
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:26,910
to be really really careful with who I

146
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:29,010
trust and try to date guys that are like

147
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:31,620
on the same type of like social spectrum

148
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:33,000
as me I know that sounds so [ __ ]

149
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,250
shitty to say but you have to think of

150
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,050
it from my perspective it's really scary

151
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,610
to like really trust somebody and let

152
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,630
somebody in if they have a lower amount

153
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:41,100
of followers it's because you really

154
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:42,900
don't know what their true intentions

155
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,190
are so it's much easier to talk to

156
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,600
people that are on like the same

157
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:47,700
wavelength or at least like in the

158
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,020
social media realm I really hope that

159
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,700
doesn't come across really pretentious

160
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:52,800
and shitty follower count at the end

161
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:54,360
that he means nothing to me my future

162
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,010
husband might have zero followers who

163
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,600
freakin cares I'm just saying from a

164
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:59,190
trust and weight it's a lot easier to

165
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,570
talk to and trust people that have a

166
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:02,670
little bit more of a social following

167
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:04,050
just so you are a little bit more sure

168
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:05,940
that there's nothing going on on the DL

169
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:07,380
Maya asked what is it like to go from

170
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,520
nobody caring about your mistakes to

171
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,530
everyone pointed them out and

172
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,940
criticizing you if you guys have been

173
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:13,500
following me for a while especially on

174
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,940
Twitter you know that I have definitely

175
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,700
I've gotten myself in a lot of a pretty

176
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:19,530
pretty awful and offensive scandals to

177
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,720
answer your question it's halfway really

178
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:23,550
[ __ ] annoying but to also I'm very

179
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,530
very thankful for it and let me tell you

180
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:27,900
why the part that I absolutely hate is

181
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:29,070
really really old content a lot of the

182
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,530
scandals that I've gotten involved in

183
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:33,840
people love to freaking dig up the past

184
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:35,550
and old tweets and old stuff and just

185
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,660
use them against me now for me

186
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:39,000
personally the tweets that were pulled

187
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:40,260
up were from a 2013 they were gross and

188
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,210
they were really really offensive and I

189
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:43,830
have since apologized for them I am not

190
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:45,210
making any excuses for them because they

191
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,290
should not happen said or I came out of

192
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:48,930
my mouth and I definitely should have

193
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:51,030
known better however that being said

194
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:52,860
there is literally no human being in the

195
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:54,870
entire world that has the same person

196
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:56,190
they were five years ago or was the same

197
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:58,140
person that they were when they were 13

198
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:59,550
years old five years ago I was just an

199
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,930
average everyday middle schooler with

200
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:02,700
like a hundred followers on Twitter they

201
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:03,750
were all for my school I didn't know

202
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,490
what it's like to have a social

203
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:07,020
following I didn't have anybody watching

204
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,580
me I didn't have anybody looking up to

205
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:10,200
me so it was a very very different world

206
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,460
I said a lot of really really gross

207
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,660
things that I shouldn't have said and

208
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,340
also a lot of things that I didn't

209
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:16,470
really understand the true impact or

210
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,430
underlying meaning of and that's just

211
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:19,470
because they didn't grow up with a lot

212
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:20,789
of diversity around me but now I know

213
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:22,289
that those things are shitty and wrong

214
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:23,100
which is why I have apologized and why

215
00:06:22,289 --> 00:06:24,390
I'm addressing them

216
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,100
but it definitely does suck to have

217
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:27,420
things keep getting pulled up constantly

218
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,040
when you've already tried to move on

219
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,210
educate yourself and just be a better

220
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,070
person in general

221
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:33,900
I definitely will always like reread it

222
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:35,640
my tweets and snapchats before I post

223
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,990
daily because I have so many of you guys

224
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,670
watch me I'm looking up to me which is a

225
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:39,660
really really huge weight on my

226
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:41,100
shoulders but it's something that I am

227
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,420
so thankful for and something that I am

228
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,220
so proud of to be leading such an

229
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,810
amazing community I would never want to

230
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,730
degrade and disappoint or I find anybody

231
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:49,560
on purpose I am I'm so thankful that I

232
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:51,060
now have you guys to call me out when I

233
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,370
[ __ ] up so I can further educate myself

234
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,390
and just be a better person in general

235
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,980
Christian asks if all of your followers

236
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:57,690
disappeared overnight and you lost all

237
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:59,550
your influence would you still continue

238
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:01,740
to do what you love without a platform I

239
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:03,390
definitely think so yes but maybe not as

240
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,530
frequently have you guys been following

241
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,940
me for a while on Instagram you know

242
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:07,740
that I kind of started doing a lot of

243
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,330
more creative and avant-garde style

244
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,220
looks and that's really where my heart

245
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:12,810
lies I talked about this before on my

246
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:14,850
channel but I really don't like doing

247
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:16,650
glam that much and I usually only do

248
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:18,510
actual like glam when it comes to events

249
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:19,980
and filming YouTube videos just because

250
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:21,660
that's what really performs well and

251
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:23,640
that's what looks pretty for like photos

252
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,930
and red carpet and stuff so I probably

253
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,370
wouldn't do it as frequently and I'd

254
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:28,470
probably only be doing makeup when it

255
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:30,120
came to like the creative artsy a crazy

256
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:31,380
type looks but I definitely still be

257
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,780
doing makeup for sure because I love it

258
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:35,880
and this is like my hobby and well now

259
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:37,890
my job but if it wasn't my job I would

260
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:40,080
still love it if that makes sense

261
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:42,060
Jayla asked how much money do you get

262
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,410
for brand sponsorships no this is the

263
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,540
question that nobody ever answers but I

264
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:46,770
know everybody wants to know but I'll

265
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:48,090
tell you why they don't answer and

266
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:50,520
that's because it's actually illegal

267
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:52,380
when we do branded or sponsorship videos

268
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,940
we always have to sign contracts that

269
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:55,260
say we're not gonna discuss how much

270
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,640
money we're being paid or what's going

271
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:58,170
on behind the scenes aside from the

272
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,880
actual content that you guys are seeing

273
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:01,290
on our Instagram pages now I've worked

274
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,090
on campaigns and products before that I

275
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:05,010
absolutely cannot discuss the financials

276
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:07,410
of it is illegal I'm not trying to get

277
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:08,700
sued in any way shape or form but I will

278
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:10,980
tell you without giving any further

279
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:12,480
detail that the most I've ever been paid

280
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:14,490
when it came to his sponsored YouTube

281
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,500
video was in the six-figure digits

282
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:17,970
Leo asked how much money have companies

283
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,530
offered you to post about them on your

284
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:21,240
social media at the end of the day

285
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:22,980
yograj Trust is a lot more important to

286
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,630
me than any amount of money I will say

287
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:26,520
that I have declined several over

288
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:28,350
$1,000,000 offers because it wasn't

289
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,330
saying that would fit my brand cemet

00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:31,620

298
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,550
annoying sometimes if you guys have any

00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:48,340

00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:52,960
put a name to the face of all the people

303
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:55,240
that have been supporting me since day

304
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:57,220

make my day I love me too you guys I

306
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:00,970
love taking pictures but I will say that

307
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:03,190
the 1% of the time I [ __ ] hate it is

308
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:04,330
when I'm eating nothing bothers me more

309
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:06,580
than when I'm about to stick my fork

310
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:07,960
into like a nice juicy steak her he's

311
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,610
some delicious french fries and ketchup

312
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,450
and my coke then when I see somebody

313
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:11,980
from the other side of the restaurant

314
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,570
kind of take a slight picture like this

315
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,800
because if I'm not gonna see yeah that

316
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:16,750
really really bothers me I just feel

317
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,190
like eating it's like a time of having a

318
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,330
good time with your friends and family

319
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:21,370
and just like it's just very very

320
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:22,990
disrespectful in general so if you see

321
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:24,610
me in public please ask me to take a

322
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:25,810
picture I would love to freakin meet you

323
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:27,790
I will give you the biggest hug people

324
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:30,220
take an amazing selfie just please if

325
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:31,630
I'm eating wait until I'm done and the

326
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:33,490
last question for today at Kalyan asked

327
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:34,420
do you love your job to end this video

328
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:37,060
on a positive note

329
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:38,320
abso-fucking-lutely I am so thankful to

00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:40,270
be living my dreams and living this

331
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,830
amazing life at only 18 years old so

332
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:43,420
many people can't even say when they're

333
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:45,370
older that they do their dream job and

334
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:46,870
Here I am being very very young freshly

335
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:48,340
out of high school and just having an

336
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:51,280
amazing time and having all of you guys

337
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:52,660
watch and support me it really does mean

338
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,950
so much to all you guys are there on the

339
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,300
other side of the camera and even though

340
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:56,110
there are hard days I wouldn't trade

341
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,640
this for the world

342
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:59,560
if you guys are like a loyal beauty

343
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,300
community fan you know there's a lot of

344
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,190
really shitty and annoying and awful

345
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:05,230
stuff that goes down in this industry it

346
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:07,390
definitely is a very very cutthroat and

347
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:08,530
hard place to survive but I would not

348
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:11,500
still be here if I didn't love what I

349
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:12,790
did trust me on that one alright guys

350
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,620
and that is all I have for this video

351
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:16,900
today my phone just died sorry I'm all

352
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:18,640
out of questions like I said before I am

353
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,930
very much an open and honest book being

354
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,820
a social-media influencer definitely has

355
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:23,950
its pros and it's cons there's some

356
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:25,900
amazing days there is good pay good

357
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:27,130
friends and cool opportunities but at

358
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,510
the same time there's a lot of heat and

359
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:30,340
really really shitty situations that we

360
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:31,930
all get ourselves into so it's

361
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:33,610
definitely a crazy world that I live in

362
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:35,680
but I'm very very thankful to be where I

363
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:36,640
am thanks to you guys I really hope you

364
