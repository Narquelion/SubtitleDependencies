challenge as you guys know for my

11
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,470
Tuesday uploads in between regular

12
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:21,000
episodes I thought I'd be really fun to

13
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,100
do a video inspired by the last

14
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,930
episode's challenge but because of copÃ¡n

15
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,960
19 and the stay at home orders a collab

16
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:30,240
challenge just isn't really possible or

17
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,219

29
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,899
[Music]

30
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,309
to start off this video today is one of

31
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:59,690
the kindest and in my opinion most

32
00:00:58,309 --> 00:01:01,129
talented artists in the beauty community

33
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:02,600
she inspired me to get my channel

34
00:01:01,129 --> 00:01:04,250
started and has always pushed me to take

35
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:10,130
my content to the next level Nikki

36
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:12,200

some stars lined up I am the first one

00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:22,369
to kick it off for you today and I am

42
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:24,229
doing foundation but the number one rule

43
00:01:22,369 --> 00:01:27,979
before applying any foundation is

44
00:01:24,229 --> 00:01:29,869
surprise because not true prime is a the

45
00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:31,940
foundation I'll be wearing today is my

46
00:01:29,869 --> 00:01:35,990
NARS this right here is the natural

47
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:37,899
radiant foundation so how is everyone

48
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:40,640
holding up during this quarantine

49
00:01:37,899 --> 00:01:43,369
madness and not just quarantine madness

50
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,770
I'm talking 2020 madness a lot of you

51
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:47,810
guys know that earlier this year I came

52
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:50,570
out as transgender not by free will

53
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:52,429
unfortunately for the full story please

54
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:56,030
check out my video but if there's one

55
00:01:52,429 --> 00:01:58,550
thing that 20/20 has made very clear for

56
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:59,869
me is that there are so many good people

57
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:02,119
left in this world

58
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:04,520
I know as beauty gurus face negativity

59
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:07,009
every single day we faced backlash every

60
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:09,259
single day but the moment I opened up

61
00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:11,780
and showed my vulnerable side and told

62
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:16,010
you my truth the warmth and the love

63
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:18,829
that I received was unmatched it was so

64
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:21,410
unreal and I cannot believe that I'm

65
00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:23,480
living my truth so openly and freely and

66
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:24,650
feeling so loved by all of you and one

67
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,269
thing and that's why I'm really excited

68
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:28,070
that we're doing this here today one

69
00:02:26,269 --> 00:02:30,410
thing that has really helped me through

70
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:32,510
the stress and the anxiety and just all

71
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:35,420
of it concerning my coming-out was

72
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:37,070
makeup makeup will always and forever be

73
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,200
that one thing in my life that keeps me

74
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:40,489
grounded and is sort of like my coping

75
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,190
mechanism like if what I'm doing here

76
00:02:40,489 --> 00:02:46,640
right now do my makeup is what keeps me

77
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:48,170

78
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,420
people that you're about to see on your

79
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:52,370

108
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,750
influencer I love what he's doing for

the community it's a very beautiful

110
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:57,470
industry it's a very crazy industry but

111
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,690
I think it's really meant to be and

112
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:01,880
speaking of industry I've been

113
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:02,840
discovering new talent on tik-tok and

114
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,630
that's what I've been doing during my

115
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:08,150
quarantine and keeping me busy and away

116
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:09,709
from the reality that we are living in

117
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:11,360
just to kind of get my mind off things

118
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:13,160
like I said the powder that I'm going to

119
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,989
use is my Patrick Starr powder that I

120
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,880
did with Matt cosmetics I poured it onto

121
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:18,799
a plate like pouring it onto a plate so

122
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,979
I have more control just any ol plate

123
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:23,330
I'm just baking right under the eye okay

124
00:04:21,979 --> 00:04:25,220
so last but not least for this step of

125
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:27,289
the concealer I'm baking this airspun

126
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:30,020
powder is so thick so heavy it's a drag

127
00:04:27,289 --> 00:04:31,789
queen staple if you ask me like to take

128
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:34,559

131
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:40,499
concludes of my concealing and baking I

132
00:04:39,539 --> 00:04:43,439
hope you guys learned some techniques

133
00:04:40,499 --> 00:04:44,939

142
00:05:01,559 --> 00:05:03,659

144
00:05:03,659 --> 00:05:08,279

145
00:05:06,179 --> 00:05:09,659
crazy I'm gonna be honest you guys they

146
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:11,909
definitely have been going through it I

147
00:05:09,659 --> 00:05:13,439
think you know even bad [ __ ] have

148
00:05:11,909 --> 00:05:15,089
feels as well and I feel like this is

149
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:17,939
just a moment to be extremely reflective

150
00:05:15,089 --> 00:05:24,059
and kind of pause I mean the world is on

151
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:25,649
pause so we all need to you know you

152
00:05:24,059 --> 00:05:27,569
know I feel like I was humans and just

153
00:05:25,649 --> 00:05:29,309
in this crazy lifestyle we're so used to

154
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:30,749
being on to the next thing on to them

155
00:05:29,309 --> 00:05:32,729
what can I do more and just wanting to

156
00:05:30,749 --> 00:05:34,799
be so rampant I think we never like slow

157
00:05:32,729 --> 00:05:36,089
down and really look at all we have and

158
00:05:34,799 --> 00:05:38,339
I feel like it especially at this time

159
00:05:36,089 --> 00:05:39,899
we we kind of see how valuable just like

160
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:41,699
health is without even realizing it you

161
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:43,289
become so selfish you become so like oh

162
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:44,819
my god what do I need oh my god I need

163
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:46,019

164
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:47,610
really don't need those things you know

165
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:49,049
like I said I think we're all kind of

166
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:51,539
going through it in a way and

167
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:53,039
reminiscing and replaying little moments

168
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:59,339

00:06:26,549 --> 00:06:32,249
I clearly don't have any catch [ __ ]

185
00:06:29,659 --> 00:06:34,499
thanks Nikita let's find my eyebrows so

186
00:06:32,249 --> 00:06:35,430
I'm using Katie D's super brow pomade to

187
00:06:34,499 --> 00:06:37,020
start filling in

188
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:38,340
missing eyebrows you're probably

189
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,410
wondering what happened to my eyebrows

190
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:43,440
and the truth is I lost them in a fight

191
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:45,150
with squirrel is that but anyway in

192
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,789
quarantine I've been spending a lot of

193
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:50,190
time with my favorite creatures on earth

194
00:06:47,789 --> 00:06:51,330
that includes my boyfriend Anthony been

195
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:53,130
getting to spend a lot of quality time

196
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:55,740
with him which I really really really

197
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:57,720
enjoy and spending it with my dog Ripley

198
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:00,240
and my newest favorite creature in the

199
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,130
house my new dog his name is creature

200
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,870
since creature is new to the world I've

201
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,880
been spending a lot of Quarantine time

202
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:08,520
teaching him new tricks and trying to

203
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:12,870
teach my first dog how to adapt to our

204
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:14,970
new dog there has never been a more

205
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:18,210
appropriate time to say this but I aim

206
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:20,220
for sister's squirrels can't stop me now

207
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:22,169
okay I think it's time for eyeshadow so

208
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:24,960
I will be passing at this palette on to

209
00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:27,599
the most super sister there is a man who

210
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:31,849
needs no introduction because it's his

211
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:33,750
channel no one the only James Charles

212
00:07:31,849 --> 00:07:35,310
thank you so much Mikey

213
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,780
hello you guys James here of course of

214
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:38,250
my mini palette let's just dive right

215
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,300
into the eyeshadow portion the one thing

216
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,169
that has really been helping me get

217
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,180
through quarantine and keep a positive

218
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:43,919
attitude has honestly been watching a

219
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:45,570
lot of nude YouTube content that is not

220
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:47,099
related to beauty since beauty is my job

221
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:48,389
and I do it every day I really don't

222
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:49,860
watch that much beauty content on

223
00:07:48,389 --> 00:07:51,510
YouTube anyway but during this

224
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,340
quarantine I have been going deeper and

225
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:54,570
deeper into the depths of YouTube and

226
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:57,000
watching a lot of content that you guys

227
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:58,380
probably never expect a few days ago I

228
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,090
actually put out a tweet saying I had

229
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:01,260
experienced new levels of boredom

230
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:02,940
because I spending my night watching

231
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:04,860
somebody play a Sudoku puzzles on

232
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:06,150
YouTube I discovered this puzzle channel

233
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,800
on YouTube called cracking it at the

234
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:09,389
cryptic and I have fallen in love with

235
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,770
their videos my absolute favorite

236
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:12,240
pastime in the entire world is doing

237
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:13,979
escape rooms but since the road is

238
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,389
obviously closed out I'm not able to do

239
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:16,889
that so if you guys are fellow nerds

240
00:08:15,389 --> 00:08:18,030
like me and you love solving puzzles I

241
00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:19,380
would deathly recommend checking out

242
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:21,300
their channel I've also been watching an

243
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:22,650
alarming amount of Minecraft videos I

244
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,659
would definitely recommend checking out

245
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:25,830
mumbo jumbo and also exhume avoid oh my

246
00:08:24,659 --> 00:08:27,389
god I almost forgot to mention to you

247
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:29,520
guys I have just recently got into a

248
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:31,680
survivor the TV show okay I know I'm

249
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,419
super super late in fact I'm 40 seasons

250
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,190
late but my friend caught me into this

251
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:37,140
new season two winners at war and I have

252
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:38,370
become so addicted I'm literally ready

253
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,750
to give up a month of my life and go

254
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:41,430
survive on a deserted island at this

255
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,390
point because it seems so far but I

256
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:44,610
haven't been watching

257
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:46,260
the show literally non-stop you guys

258
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:47,459
should definitely leave me a comment

259
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,660
down below and let me know what you've

260
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:50,070
been watching to stay entertained it

261
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:52,709
during this quarantine and helpful hint

262
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:54,029
it better be it's the influencer alright

263
00:08:52,709 --> 00:08:55,800
that is the eyeshadow portion all

264
00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:56,730
complete but as you guys can see we

265
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,500
still have a little bit left to go on

266
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:00,390
the eyes and of course the rest of the

267
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,040
face so I'm gonna grab a fresh pair of

268
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:03,209
Lillie lashes and I'm gonna hand them to

269
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,500
somebody who could always make me smile

270
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,730
no matter what I'm going through and it

271
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,040
was also taught me that even though this

272
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:09,360
is my job it's okay to have fun I never

273
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,940
take life too seriously and most

274
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:22,140
importantly it to be a bad [ __ ] well

so I'm going to be doing it my nails so

355
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:45,579
while a quarantine I've been spending

356
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:47,260
time with my family since normally we

357
00:12:45,579 --> 00:12:48,970
all have a really busy days I feel like

358
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:50,980
I never really get to spend that time

359
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:53,260
with them so now that we're all at home

360
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:54,820
I finally get that family time I'm very

361
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:56,440
family-oriented so I'm definitely taking

362
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:58,329
advantage of this time to spend it with

363
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:00,640
my family since I'm always on the road

global pandemic and we know that

the virus and Cova 19 our relief if you

406
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,900
look over right here on your YouTube

407
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:46,400
screen you will see a donation button it

408
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:48,140
is definitely not necessary or required

409
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,640
but if you have a little bit of extra

410
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:51,050
money lying around and you're able to

411
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,760
donate I strongly encourage you guys to

412
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:54,290
use the box right up here and what's

413
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,970
even cooler about this is that Google

414
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:58,100
actually made a valve to match every

415
00:14:55,970 --> 00:15:00,080
single dollar donated it with two so

416
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,970
basically three dollars from every one

417
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,020
dollar which is super super cool and I

418
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:04,160
would love to work together as the

419
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:06,380
beauty community to make a positive

420
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,520
impact just wanted to add it since we

421
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,150
were able to put this together for my

422
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,440
youtube channel

423
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:10,820
I thought it'd be only appropriate to

424
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,340
get the fundraiser started I'll be

425
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:15,550
personally donating at $25,000 to copa90

426
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:18,200
relief which thanks to Google becomes

427
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:20,300
75,000 I know these times are really

428
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:22,910
hard if we work together as a community

429
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:25,790
we can get through this always remember

430
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:28,820
