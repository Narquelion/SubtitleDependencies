00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:58,469
alerts in today's video we challenged a

28
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:00,300
contestants to do their ultimate drive

29
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:01,800
at transformation doing drag is not easy

30
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,290
and do direct for the first time at a

31
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,540
competition I mean that is not no those

32
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,760
people were struggling but a lot of them

33
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,150
really did it turn it out so for today's

34
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,590
video

35
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,880
I thought it'd be really fun at 4 tricks

36
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,040
tonight to sit down together and do our

37
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,210
ultimate Drive transformations I know

38
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,740
that there's probably people that are

39
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,390
like matha that you're not transforming

40
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:20,130
me but I feel like you've done so many

41
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:22,530
trips to transformations at this point

42
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,670
yeah only I'm not my makeup on other

43
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,740
people we all look exactly the same

44
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:28,290
that's great it's such a signature like

45
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,939
damn thing every time so that'll be it

46
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,979
much more fun to just get ready together

47
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:33,600
in drag do our own ultimate drug

48
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:34,829
transformations talk all about to try

49
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,750
grace the different shows you've worked

50
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:39,000
on it into influencer behind the scenes

51
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,340
t from the show and so much more so if

52
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:47,030
you guys want to see us go from this to

53
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:47,030
this and then we're exactly the same

54
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:55,730
keep on hunting

55
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:55,730
[Music]

56
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,860
you clean your brows down yeah I don't

57
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:07,439
know this you didn't have to snap so

58
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,880
hard pop off why did you say that what

59
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,679
is that problem I'm just very young and

60
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,630
I like I like I say a lot of young

61
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:15,480
things I will say when I got to judge

62
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:17,519
innocent but it when I got to judge on

63
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,410
instant influencer it was exciting but I

64
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:21,269
had to judge after Paris Hilton so it

65
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:23,130
was a little bit like oh you know Paris

66
00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:25,500
Hilton was just here she is so yeah but

67
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:27,300
your check secret oh yeah but I was so

68
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,630
jealous she was there the day before me

69
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:33,390
like oh okay to be honest I literally

70
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:34,950
love Paris but do you were honestly

71
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,880
probably the guest judge that I was most

72
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,200
excited about

73
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,459
I got the opportunity to work with

74
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,019
because I wrote Alice I have met before

75
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:41,549
and I've gotten to work with before you

76
00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:43,200
were like kind of the one person that I

77
00:02:41,549 --> 00:02:45,299
have like loved and respected and looked

78
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,380
up to for so long I'd like Deanne back

79
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:47,610
and forth like a few times and stuff but

80
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,170
never really got the opportunity to

81
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:51,090
actually like murk on a project together

82
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,470
building was so much fun for me but I'd

83
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,640
be completely lying if I said that like

84
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,900
being on set wasn't also really

85
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,180
stressful because it was like 14-hour

86
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,519
days for me so you yeah being on set

87
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:01,290
made me smile so hard and made me laugh

88
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,739
the entire time and like made Ian

89
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:08,160
experience so enjoyable so she does her

90
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:09,329
own makeup who you oh I don't know if

91
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,340
people know that you put your own makeup

92
00:03:09,329 --> 00:03:12,600
on the show yeah always who why to be

93
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,790
judging a makeup competition if I can't

94
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,140
even do my own makeup T there we go and

95
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:18,329
also I was so excited to do it because

96
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:20,820
I'm not like a TV watcher I'm a like

97
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:22,200
digital media consumer I'm upset I mean

98
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,220
everything I love is from YouTube so

99
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,100
especially since it was a youtube

100
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:28,530
original I was like this is my HBO time

101
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:33,120
young I am only 30 but I know that in

102
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:34,380
this room that means 50 okay I normally

103
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,049
don't even do this I just want to feel

104
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:39,000
included I want to talk about the first

105
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:41,710
time that we met it was at the movie

106
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,600

like heard you talking behind me does it

112
00:03:55,879 --> 00:04:00,720
I was so scared to even look back

113
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:02,310
because I let me thought that you hated

114
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,599
me well I didn't help that I got really

115
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:08,970
close to here and said well it was

116
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:12,540
because of the fandom drama that had

117
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:13,590

00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,780

people sitting on a chair talking if

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,740
some drama that may or may not be real

123
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:25,110

00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,490
a roll of Froot Loops I'm happy for you

125
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:28,650

128
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,500
the color that I chose to put on myself

129
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,240
yeah what okay I know doesn't look that

130
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,820
breezy I got really burn in the Sun I'm

131
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,470
gonna listen it's okay to go darker here

132
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,849
when you go lighter here right we're

133
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:49,620
gonna later that's all right don't worry

134
00:04:47,849 --> 00:04:51,060
with the show thing like literally it

135
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:54,000
was so crazy to you that that started

136
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:55,530
such a like war in between my fans and

137
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,760
yours because literally like people knew

138
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:58,020
that I was the biggest fan of you and

139
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:01,229
like we talked about it and the episode

140
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,889
be like yeah this is inspired by oh this

141
00:05:01,229 --> 00:05:04,139
is so crazy

142
00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:06,210
didn't Chris edit it yes okay the guy

143
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:08,430
who edited that was originally an editor

144
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:09,270
on on so like we hired at the original

145
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,500
artists which I definitely think a

146
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:12,419
support like we had people that were

147
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,380
offering to like try to replicate it but

148
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:14,639
I was like you know if we're gonna do

149
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,260
this sound inspired by that I'm like I

150
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,090
want to pay the original person who like

151
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:20,010
did it you know yeah by the way speaking

152
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:21,870
of inspiring you know confident I get to

153
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:23,639
use this every single day oh god do you

154
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:25,650
really yes because what's like a DM

155
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:27,449
getting a drag usually and she is not

156
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:29,699
that like her relationship with makeup

157
00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:31,590
is completely utility based if you can

158
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:33,330
get ready fast and easy she likes it

159
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:36,360
okay I have a fun question for you I

160
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:38,940
love fun after being on drag race season

161
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,050
7 and then winning all stars 3 I know

162
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,810
that you said you never wanted to

163
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:44,940
compete in like again yeah now that

164
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:46,199
you've also judged into influencer do

165
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,099
you like competing or judging better

166
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,380
Chachi

167
00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:51,970
oh my controversial opinion

168
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:54,790
plugs on you because you don't like the

169
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:56,620
judges they do nothing they do not lies

170
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:59,770
they're lit well and they're giving

171
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:02,560
their opinion of others but competing is

172
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:04,810
so anxiety-ridden yeah I am such a

173
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,850
competitive person that like you are yes

174
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:08,890
would you ever do a competition yes what

175
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:12,610

do it I want to know what were your

182
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:26,530
expectations of an influencer before

you've out there oh this is really good

184
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:30,040

185
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:31,360
you finished and now what do you think

186
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,070
now that you've seen the episode it was

187
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,750
filmed at the YouTube original space

188
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:36,610
look at the YouTube space which is like

189
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:39,250
a whole day Airport hangar right yeah so

190
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:44,740
it's huge she was really really

191
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:47,470
high-quality like he said your story is

192
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:49,660
not interesting I love that you've been

193
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:52,420
sadly one of the only Queens to really

194
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:55,030
embrace YouTube for a contest I mean

195
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:57,040
especially like with um I owe everything

196
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:58,570
to that show right and everything to the

197
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,920
fact that people watch my show on the

198
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:01,540
Internet so like especially when I

199
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,280
started producing more Beauty content

200
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:04,870
but kind of like making it which by the

201
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,370
way my channel is just Trixie Mattel as

202
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:07,930
well it's like how can we marry Beauty

203
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:09,580
content but make it really comedy

204
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:11,770
content you know what I mean yeah I mean

205
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,000
even my channels like it's makeup at the

206
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:17,410
end of a but like it's so much more

207
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,910
idiocy I'm so horrified how my face is

208
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:20,890

209
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:22,420

214
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,400

215
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,720
works I mean honestly this season has

216
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,460

217
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,970

00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:41,740

00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:50,920

00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:54,070
sickening but I can't I'm not gonna get

the other one to map what are you using

228

230
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:06,330
[Music]

237
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:22,529
saw each other outside of drag Con two

238
00:08:20,999 --> 00:08:25,439
years ago and me and kimchi were like

239
00:08:22,529 --> 00:08:27,240
sitting on a sock no wig on my krottas

240
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:29,249
and then you came around the corner in

241
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,379
that white gown how was your drag calm

242
00:08:29,249 --> 00:08:32,729

243
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:34,680
never been a drag Con it really is

244
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:35,759
Disneyland I mean it's crazy

245
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,649
it was so fun I had the best experience

246
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:38,639
cuz like I had done transformations I

247
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:40,019
have done the makeup I've done the wigs

248
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:41,459
and stuff but like I have never been

249
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,930
like how to coerce it before that I had

250
00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:44,519
never like actually the house like a

251
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:45,810
full you know the full moment but I also

252
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:47,699
got to meet so many queens that I have

253
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:49,649
been looking up to forever I'm either

254
00:08:47,699 --> 00:08:51,630
meeting people or I'm doing the press so

255
00:08:49,649 --> 00:08:53,220
I'm like just go on right if you want to

256
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:54,660
meet Trixie you have to cut through a

257
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,279
line of 100 teenage girls and they will

258
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,569
kill you mmm don't get me started on

259
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:59,639
cutting the lines at our club you know

260
00:08:57,569 --> 00:09:01,680
people heard people still to this day

261
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:03,300
bring that up about me still would you

262
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,009
like to clear the air yes I would love

263
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,480
to clear the air so two years ago I got

264
00:09:05,009 --> 00:09:07,589
invited to go to Drakon and I was

265
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,910
supposed to do a meet and greet this is

266
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:10,649
what I held like a million followers I

267
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:12,029
think and I woke up that morning feeling

268
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:13,470
like really nauseous just like it was

269
00:09:12,029 --> 00:09:14,970
not a good day to wake up with 6:00 in

270
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:17,160
the morning to get into full drag to

271
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:18,149
then go in and for five people so later

272
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,130
on that day like right when it's about

273
00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:21,180
to end I notified like the team that I

274
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:22,740
was working with and I was like hey I

275
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:24,600
would really still love to go and just

276
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:25,889
pop in like how I still go oh my gosh

277
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,930
yes of course like we'd love to have you

278
00:09:25,889 --> 00:09:29,579
and I got there and started getting mom

279
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:31,170
like it was like crazy so as soon as I

280
00:09:29,579 --> 00:09:33,569
got there they gave me a full security

281
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:35,009
team to walk me around I wanted to see a

282
00:09:33,569 --> 00:09:36,720
few different drag queens itself and the

283
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:38,399
security team that was with me brought

284
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,810
me to the front of the lines so I could

285
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,639
meet the Queen's get a photo and get out

286
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:43,199
and listen I get it like even I like

287
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:44,759
don't like honey Lyons but the reality

288
00:09:43,199 --> 00:09:46,470
is you have to be saved but you have to

289
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:48,420
be smart so they wanted to get me in and

290
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:49,829
get me out because the DA is gonna start

291
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,480
a problem like that it's when kids start

292
00:09:49,829 --> 00:09:52,889
lining up or asking for photos or

293
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,420
crowding and then that's when the people

294
00:09:52,889 --> 00:09:55,889
in line get angry that some people get

295
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,329
hurt some people get trampled and it was

296
00:09:55,889 --> 00:09:58,100
never

297
00:09:56,329 --> 00:10:00,379
attention to her anybody or to make

298
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,850
anybody feel lost data but still doesn't

299
00:10:00,379 --> 00:10:03,319
say that scandal follows me around the

300
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:05,239
drug community I've heard that before

301
00:10:03,319 --> 00:10:07,309
too so they are three years later I

302
00:10:05,239 --> 00:10:08,989
still do not think that I'm superior to

303
00:10:07,309 --> 00:10:10,579
anybody I don't think time superior to

304
00:10:08,989 --> 00:10:12,769
drive me literally to seeing it to get

305
00:10:10,579 --> 00:10:15,559

306
00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:17,209
teenager confirmed oh I mean that 40 on

311
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:25,100

00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:07,589
into the art of drag and like what

365
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:09,720
advice would you give to future Queens

366
00:12:07,589 --> 00:12:11,399
I've been doing drag 12 years I'm at the

367
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,899
point where people who are now 18 or

368
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:14,550
whatever I'm their first reference now

369
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:16,529
like that's what ya do it especially

370
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:17,880
with kotti I'm like ah because people

371
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:20,459
like comedy or they like country music

372
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,660
I'm what gets them into drag it's really

373
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:23,160
cool because when I try to draw

374
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:25,649
parallels in my own life I'm like oh my

375
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:27,060
god what if I'm I love Lady Bunny what

376
00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:29,040
if I'm someone's Lady Bunny you know

377
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,149
like that's oh it's just cool definitely

378
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,800
one of the ones that caught me in spirit

379
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:33,839

380
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,579

381
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,620
about 80 pounds of makeup and several

382
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:39,420
hours of good conversation later these

383
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:40,589

384
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:42,089
