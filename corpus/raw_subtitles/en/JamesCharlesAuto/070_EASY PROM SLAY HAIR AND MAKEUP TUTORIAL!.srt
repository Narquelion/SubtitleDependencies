00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:09,360

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:10,889

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,599

4
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:14,400
special guest and one of the og sisters

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,230
sister Laura since it is the beginning

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,330
of math that means prom season is here I

8
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,500
am so excited to see all my beautiful

9
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,090
friends going to prom

10
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,619
I remember last year for me prom was one

11
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,210
of the most magical experiences of my

12
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:28,710
entire life and I know it's like a dream

13
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,150
for everybody so for today's video I

14
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:33,329
teamed up with sister Laura of course

15
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,559
but also with Ava hair NYC those are you

16
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:36,270
guys who don't know before I actually

17
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,010
did makeup or ever even try and make up

18
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,870
in the first place I didn't used to do

19
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,059
hair styling and that was my big passion

20
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,980
and job forget like two or three years

21
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:45,660
before I ever picked up a foundation or

22
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,550
blending marks or anything of the sort I

23
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:50,219
was holding hairspray curling wands and

24
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,930
lots of coltan of bobby pins it has been

25
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:53,460
a good two or three years since I've

26
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:56,430
actually picked up a hair styling tool

27
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,989
so it was so fun and crazy to think this

28
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,160
look I am honestly so shocked that I

29
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:00,840
still have this in me

30
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,300
I created this like braided updo

31
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,799
situation on sister Laura I'm really

32
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,720
really proud of how it turned out we

33
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,150
even have her extensions hidden which is

34
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,100
a very very very hard thing to do

35
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,810
when it comes to hair styling so we were

36
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,060
super one anothers it turned out and I

37
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,979
also created this makeup look - it's

38
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,020
very very light airy duty with just a

39
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:20,670
simple Papa glitter on the leg perfect

40
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,710
for prom I would say if I makeup it's

41
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,729
fun to be super super glam but just like

42
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:25,439
it's the best version of yourself

43
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:27,990
because it even want to be photographing

44
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,729
well no flashback Mary's situation and

45
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,750
just a whole lot of like beautiful fun

46
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:32,490
pictures with all of your good friends

47
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,049
on this very special high magical night

48
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:36,360
that being said this is going to be a

49
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:37,470
crazy combination at tutorial all in one

50
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,610
so I'm going to show you guys how to

51
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,780
think this hairstyle first then we're

52
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:41,520
gonna go right into the super easy

53
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,990
makeup look so if you wanted to see how

54
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,920
you created at both of these looks make

55
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:47,939
sure you keep on watching alright guys

56
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,619
so we're starting off with Laura's hair

57
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:51,299
already pre-washed off Cameron's in the

58
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:53,220
clean it up shampoo and a soften up

59
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:54,360
conditioner we then went to the therapy

60
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,040
session hair masks which are all

61
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,719
scientifically proven to strengthen hair

62
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,850
we did this off-camera or let it be

63
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:01,320
sitting here for like 54 hours and then

64
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,880
we went on with the main magic time in

65
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,870
wanna primer we're gonna be using a

66
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,070
whole lot of product today

67
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,510
I'm just gonna spread says all over the

68
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:08,520
air to make sure it was really locked in

69
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:10,950
place and ready to go for styling of all

70
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,480
of that sorts of stuff I they don't live

71
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:14,220
it with the steerer but just to prep the

72
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,990
tips and middle of the hair to protect

73
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,490
from heat because obviously very amusing

74
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:19,500
lots of tools like will gyro

75
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:20,580
straightening iron curling wands we want

76
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,010
to make sure if Laura's hair is very

77
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:25,020
very safe and protected because yeah we

78
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,980
don't want it to die and fry off and

79
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,870
we're going to go into this hair dryer

80
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:30,060
and just dry Laura's hair because it is

81
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:31,260
still wet we did just wash it up few

82
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,610
minutes ago and obviously if the hair

83
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,350
needs to be drying for it to be silent

84
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,240
so I'm just using this hair dryer and a

85
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:38,220
flat brush just to a bun boot brush

86
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,080
through the hair on the hair dryer so it

87
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,490
straightens at the same time and then

88
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,350
we're going to go with the straightening

89
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:44,400
iron as well just to go over all of

90
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:46,170
Laura's care to make sure it is

91
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,340
SuperDuper straight and prepped for

92
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:48,570
asylum

93
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,640
I'm just going to take small little

94
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:52,980
sections as always and just straighten

95
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,720
the hair all the way around including

96
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,400
like these for these parts in the front

97
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,110
because Lord does have extensions in her

98
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,540
hair so for the most part the extensions

99
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:01,770
are straight for her normal hair is not

100
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:04,320
straight so we need to make sure they

101
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:06,000
are really really blending together to

102
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,890
begin the curling process I'm going to

103
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,100
section off Lois hair and split it right

104
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:13,020
in half down the town of behind that was

105
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:15,780
enough for some reason and then I went

106
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:17,100
to the IVA NYC at texturizing spray this

107
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,420
is really going to help to style the

108
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:20,610
hair and make sure it is super super

109
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,739
locked in place and ready to go and also

110
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:24,150
provides a lot of volume I'm then going

111
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:26,070
to this color one and look like to just

112
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:27,959
begin curling all of Lauren's hair I'm

113
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:29,700
going to just wrap the hair around in

114
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:31,709
small sections and then once that coat

115
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,910
is done I'm gonna hold it in my hand

116
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:34,860
just to make sure it is really really

117
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:37,380
locked in place before I let it down

118
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:38,850
just like that I'm gonna go around and

119
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:40,110
crawl all of those hairs is done we're

120
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,100
gonna take a little bit of time but I

121
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:43,080
would have had my sped up the process

122
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,790
and cut a ton of out rolls do you guys

123
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,070
have to be sitting here for 16 hours

124
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:48,780
only crawl for her but yeah I'm just

125
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:50,190
gonna curl it all in to loose sections

126
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,420
I'm also switching up the direction as

127
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:53,190
well so they all don't look very very

128
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,959
unifying we do not want them to be like

129
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:56,070
all super tight bringing that curls but

130
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,910
they are gonna start off a little type

131
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:58,739
of we're just gonna brush them through

132
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:00,530
later on and they're going to loosen up

133
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:02,240
and look much more better

134
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:03,890
a lot more like natural and kind of

135
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,569
warned that is the look we were going

136
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:08,510
for today and that'll be perfect for

137
00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:10,400
styling the updo coming in a few seconds

138
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:11,870
I'm going ahead and I took down the top

139
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,060
of Laura's hair which as you can see is

140
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:15,620
very very frizzy and maybe my dad was

141
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,790
saying before she does have extensions

142
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,989
so I'm not just going to go ahead and

143
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:19,579
I'm going to curl the top sections as

144
00:04:17,989 --> 00:04:21,320
well making sure they blend well

145
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:23,060
together with the bottom portions and

146
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,130
then I'm just going to brush everything

147
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:27,290
together next I want to start doing this

148
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:29,060
tiny little braid on Laura's hair she

149
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:30,919
does have a side part not a middle part

150
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:33,440
so I'm starting this on the lower of the

151
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:35,210
two parts if that makes any sense at all

152
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,190
I'm just starting by up doing a normal

153
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:39,830
braid with three strands then I'm adding

154
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:41,510
hair as I go over the middle strand I

155
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:42,740
think this is pretty hard to explain

156
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:44,510
I've never actually done a hair video

157
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,770
before so if you guys want me to do more

158
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:47,210
I can definitely try to like get better

159
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:48,560
at angles or like explaining these type

160
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:50,150
of things I've been doing this for years

161
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,160
now so it just kind of comes firsthand

162
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:54,560
to me but I am just doing a normal braid

163
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,750
and adding sections in very very tiny so

164
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,130
it creates a smaller ablated effect and

165
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,570
like I said lower does have extensions

166
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:01,580
Illinois are these tiny sections and

167
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:03,380
pull this braid up to the head I'm being

168
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:05,180
very very strategic in line place then

169
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,560
just make sure those extension tapes are

170
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,450
very very well hidden

171
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,919
once that brings all done I'm just

172
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:11,419
finishing off and braiding off the rest

173
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:13,520
of the hair and then I'm going to go in

174
00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:15,020
I'm going to a pancake the braid this is

175
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,340
a technique I learned from a cute girls

176
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:18,050
hairstyles here on YouTube they are an

177
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:19,610
amazing channel but I'm just taking the

178
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:21,350
hair and I'm lightly pulling out the

179
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:23,240
sides of the Strand just make the bring

180
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:24,740
up a lot more volume and kind of make it

181
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,229
look like effortless and kind of like

182
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:29,419
lived and now I'm gonna fake this little

183
00:05:27,229 --> 00:05:30,680
like poop on at the top this is often in

184
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:31,850
a lot of wedding hairstyles and I'm

185
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,140
gonna add it for this hairstyle today

186
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:34,760
but I didn't really don't want to do a

187
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:36,320
lot of TV because Laura's extensions

188
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,850
make that very very far so I'm taking

189
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,039
this section from the crown boy's head

190
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:41,510
and tying it off into a high pony and

191
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:43,340
then I'm gonna just grab some bobby pins

192
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:46,100
and I'm going to push that ponytail

193
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:48,110
upwards creating a little pouf in the

194
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:49,700
back and it's gonna pin that in place I

195
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:51,440
use like 4 or 5 bobby pins make sure

196
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,539
it's really really locked in there but

197
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,950
by having this hair tie there it does

198
00:05:53,539 --> 00:05:56,870
allow us to push that ponytail up

199
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:58,760
creating that focu without having to use

200
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:01,340
like 54 million pounds of hairspray and

201
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,560
bobby pins I'm a-goin and leaving out

202
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,270
small sections on the left

203
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,770
the hair but seeing a large chunk of

204
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:08,020
curls from the middle and I'm going to

205
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:09,610
tie these together this is one of my

206
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:11,650
favorite tricks to do it very very super

207
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:13,360
quick updos I can pull the updos

208
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:15,040
together in like 30 or 40 minutes when

209
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,990
sometimes it takes up like an hour or

210
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,820
two hours depending on little curls in

211
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:20,500
place so all I did with scraps together

212
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:22,810
the big chunk of curls into a ponytail

213
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,940
and I'm just pinning the little sections

214
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:26,169
to the back of Laura's head this is kind

215
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,730
of hard to explain but just watch as I

216
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:29,230
go and now I'm taking the sections from

217
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:30,669
the left and right sides as well just

218
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:32,200
forming them and little curls little

219
00:06:30,669 --> 00:06:34,419
ringlets and just pin them to the sides

220
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,160
of the head this creates the effect as

221
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:37,780
if I literally sat there and each curl

222
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,610
to the head when in reality we just

223
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:41,740
created them into a big little like big

224
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:43,090
curly fun but I think the same effect

225
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:46,210
than it looks equally as beautiful and

226
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:47,169
it saves you so much time like I said

227
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:48,910
before I'm just playing around with

228
00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:50,290
different areas different places kind of

229
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:52,570
just playing around with the hair thing

230
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:54,520
where I would say sure that kind of be I

231
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:55,720
decided to take these left and right

232
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,460
sections and pin them underneath the

233
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,260
hair just to kind of give it the bond a

234
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:00,669
little bit more shape and volume just

235
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:02,320
ratio that nothing was I really flying

236
00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:03,940
around and just kind of locks it in

237
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,200
place I know that excess hair I was

238
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,640
gonna pin it I think right up to the

239
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,580
slide yeah I just pinned it right up

240
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,990
again then it finished all I was gonna

241
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:12,820
grab the braid and pin it right over the

242
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:15,280
top of the bun and just lock it in place

243
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:17,140
beep in the excess and light as well and

244
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,250
that is the completed updo and I'm just

245
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:20,010
gonna finish off by spraying it with

246
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:22,240
some dry shampoo to lock it Anna please

247
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:24,400
now we're gonna talk with Lois to make

248
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,050
up for today for her foundation I went

249
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,520
into the Urban Decay all nighter this is

250
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:29,289
Laura's pret favorite foundation that

251
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,180
she absolutely loves it and it just like

252
00:07:29,289 --> 00:07:32,650
the name says this is for prom obviously

253
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,940
so we do want to be wearing it all night

254
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:35,530
long and you want to last through all

255
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:36,430
the dancing and getting tough on the day

256
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:39,639
before and hopefully

257
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:40,990
Conde so yeah it's a great foundation or

258
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:42,610
concealer tonight little using the apart

259
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:44,470
shape concealer as I said this is my

260
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:46,030
all-time favorite and it is more as well

261
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:46,840
I definitely got her hooked on this so

262
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:48,340
we're just putting this in the high

263
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,660
points of the face and then it's gonna

264
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:51,759
blend it out really really quickly using

265
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:53,199
my Beauty Blender I know I'm going

266
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,639
through this super super fast but

267
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,039
there's a lot going on in this tutorial

268
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,330
it is two parts like I said before so if

269
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,830
it was like a normal time it would

270
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:01,120
really be here for 54 hours so I really

271
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:03,160
hope you guys are like understanding

272
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,780
what's going on and then I'm going to

273
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,580
set Loris face in place using the RCM a

274
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:07,960
no color powder I've never actually

275
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:09,550
tried this powder this is my first time

276
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,110
using it today but Laura loves and

277
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:12,850
recommended it to me and I love it as

278
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:14,979
well now so I definitely will be a buy

279
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:17,020
myself a bottle and trying it out for

280
00:08:14,979 --> 00:08:19,120
sure I just went ahead in my bronze

281
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:20,500
alloys face using hoola bronzer this is

282
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,760
both of our all-time favorite balancers

283
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,080
and it works very very well for both of

284
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,460
our skin tones so I'm just really

285
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,750
broadening at my face lightly I don't

286
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:27,699
want to really be doing a lot of a

287
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:29,020
contouring and then it's going in with a

288
00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:30,760
Beauty Blender once again and one that

289
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:32,469
RC made no flower powder just to lightly

290
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,880
baked lower space underneath those

291
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:36,339
highlighted area so just lock everything

292
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,750
in place for brows today I'm using the

293
00:08:36,339 --> 00:08:39,909
benefit from system eyebrow pencil in

294
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,479
the shade number 4 I apologize this is

295
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:41,830
out of focus

296
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,880
I'm not really sure why for some reason

297
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:44,200
to call down to my face which is

298
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,820
obviously not the purpose of this video

299
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,500
so I'm sorry but I'm just lightly

300
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,910
filling in her eyebrows and then of

301
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,350
course with an angle brush and some more

302
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:53,339
shape to concealer just to clean them up

303
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:55,570
and shake them like they're all good and

304
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:56,920
so I started I'm using a modern

305
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:59,470
undisclosed palette and I'm working with

306
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,540
this burnt orange shade on my morphe m4

307
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:03,610
23 brush and this we're doing a really

308
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:05,350
really light halo eye I just picked up

309
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:06,279
this orange shade on the one thing and

310
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,540
that same brush and I'm going to be

311
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:09,459
doing that in the outer and inner

312
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:11,410
corners and just lightly blending that

313
00:09:09,459 --> 00:09:12,610
out then I'm gonna go into the shade of

314
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:13,900
the mirror on this light fluffy brush

315
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:15,070
and just pop this in at the very very

316
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,350
center of it

317
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:18,700
this color is so beautiful I absolutely

318
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:21,010
love it and it just creates a very very

319
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:22,209
open and beautiful effect I'm then going

320
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:23,560
to over line it with the Urban Decay

321
00:09:22,209 --> 00:09:26,460
glitter liner in the shaded Midnight

322
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,690
Cowboy just create a pop of bitter on

323
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:29,100
and then going to the bottom I shied

324
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:31,500
away with you or about four orange

325
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:33,180

Laura she's in her promise I know it

337
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,810

338
00:09:55,530 --> 00:10:00,990
