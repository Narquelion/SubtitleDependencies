4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,490
I've never actually done on the channel

7
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,130
honest to do and tell you okay that

8
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:15,660
there is a reason that I've never done

9
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,150
and makeup hacks video and that is

10
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,880
because I think may come have some

11
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:22,619
stupid can I would say God listen I am

12
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,689
all here and I'm super supportive of

13
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:26,099
whatever tips techniques and tricks that

14
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:27,840
you want to do to finish your makeup

15
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:29,189
routine and for being honest if you're a

16
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,750
beginner makeup artist a gift can be a

17
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:32,009
really really tricky and sometimes there

18
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,809
are really helpful tips and techniques

19
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:35,190
online and as long as you feel beautiful

20
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:37,230

that is truly all it matters so do

22
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:41,070
whatever you got to do but the reason

23
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:43,260
that I personally hate these like makeup

24
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,030
hacks videos that have been popping up

25
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,610
on tik-tok and on YouTube and on my

26
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:50,910
Instagram is because 99% of the time

27
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:52,410
they just do not work so for the past

28
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,910
few weeks I've been paying very very

29
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,530
close attention across the different

30
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,420
social video platforms at these

31
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,980
advertisements for these makeup hack

32
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,559
products that claim to make my routine

33
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,969
18 million times easier they're all

34
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:04,439
sitting here in front of me and for

35
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:06,150
today's video we're going to put these

36
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:07,680
makeup hacks to the test

37
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:13,170
so let's get started

38
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:15,250
[Music]

39
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,990
I'll write you faces when we jump into

40
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:18,370
our actual makeup routine this at first

41
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:20,920
hack is something that has to be done

42
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:23,110
before the makeup goes on and that is an

43
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,610
eyebrow lamination now I do not know

44
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:27,670
what laminating and eyebrows is

45
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:29,740
basically it's like a technique that

46
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:31,780
like locks your hairs in a certain

47
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:33,280
direction that sounds crazy mother just

48
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,420
open this up and get this started so we

49
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,950
can see what we're talking about here

50
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:37,180
it's like if you just like put brow gel

51
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:39,750
in your hair and then just like left it

52
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:43,420
there for a few weeks

53
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:45,700
eyebrow elimination upkeep eyebrows dry

54
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:46,990
for 24 hours I mean if I'm just careful

55
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,360
with my foundation I feel like it'll be

56
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:51,430
fine right

57
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,950
Yolo so first it says use a cleanser

58
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:59,350
which is solution number 4 use a clean

59
00:01:53,950 --> 00:02:03,430
micro brush to apply lift solution oh my

60
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:05,350
god that smells rotten

61
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:12,100
ok I'm gonna just brush this through the

62
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:13,900
hairs yeah oh it's worm it's a chemical

63
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,640
reaction okay so I feel like in the

64
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,930
meantime of at the brothel is really

65
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,030
laminating we could get started on

66
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:21,370
another makeup ha and this one I have

67
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:24,910
honestly been the most hated to try and

68
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:27,220
that is this makeup brush cleanser so

69
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:29,709
basically what this is is a fun little

70
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:31,030
fishbowl is the what this looks like a

71
00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:32,350
thing that looks like a nose hair

72
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:34,750
trimmer we're gonna grab this morphe i'm

73
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:36,310
5 to 7 this is normally my bronzer brush

74
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,500
and as you can see it is very very dirty

75
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:40,420
it normally looks like this so clearly

76
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,530
quite the color difference going on and

77
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:43,090
I'm gonna grab and wanted like the

78
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:45,250
little rubber thing he said shove it on

79
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:51,989
the end we're gonna shove this now onto

80
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:54,989
our spinner like this what does what

81
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:54,989
whoa

82
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:00,260
give her a nice fish bowl filled with

83
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:05,340
some cleansing solution and our water

84
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:08,100
dip oh whoa

85
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,370
really turning around this is taking too

86
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:16,830
long

87
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:23,850
I'm all over this oh that's definitely

88
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:24,990
not clean now like okay let's does a few

89
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:26,520
other brushes before we make our

90
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:28,410
decision so we took out this morphe i'm

91
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,450
4-3-3 and as you can see this one has it

92
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:32,250
some nice red a shadow on it and if you

93
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:35,190
remember back to 2018 when I really like

94
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:40,740
how we know that this color stains yeah

95
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:42,300
now we're gonna clean it off oh no can

96
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:45,450
you give a nice zoom into that wait here

97
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:47,340
oh yeah that's a nice and a ruined brush

98
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:48,750
right there ooh okay I'm gonna go ahead

99
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,760
and call it quits on this makeup brush

100
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:52,920
cleaning huh as you guys can see both

101
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,780
brushes are in fact actually cleaned

102
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,940
which is not really surprising to me I

103
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,410
mean it's water and makeup soap and

104
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,880
brushes which is always gonna be a

105
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:02,070
foolproof thing we're really talking

106
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:04,019
about this whole spitting situation as

107
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:05,700
the actual high and I'm gonna say this

108
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:07,170
actually would not recommend and I'm

109
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,280
going to tell you why okay when you're

110
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:09,600
cleaning your maker brushes obviously

111
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,250
everybody has different techniques some

112
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:14,820
people don't even ever clean them which

113
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:16,500
okay hello there are some definite

114
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:18,660
recommendations and spinning your

115
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,890
brushes at a very very high speed to the

116
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,780
point where they get flattened

117
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:23,580
and ruin their shape is definitely not

118
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:24,630
the ideal technique I'll tell you that

119
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,729
right now they're going to basically

120
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:28,320
like to stay the shape forever and then

121
00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:29,669
you're a twenty dollar bronzer brush

122
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,350
that you spent your hard-earned money on

123
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:33,900
is now going to be a nice little

124
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:35,280
mushroom situation alright so moving on

125
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:38,550
at this point I'm pretty sure we are

126
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,110
right oh that is triggering the lifting

127
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:43,140
solution has been on for 12 minutes now

128
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:44,370
so we're going to peel this off now

129
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,810
we're going to take another clean brush

130
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:49,140
with a solution at number two which is

131
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:50,910
blue oh this one smells fine thank God

132
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:52,919
okay and we're going to apply this to

133
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:54,210
the brows once again and I guess the

134
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:55,650
solution that's going to like lock the

135
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,060
brows in place so we're going to make

136
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:59,700
sure that we get them in the

137
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:01,050
right position okay now that we have

138
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,550
this around a pond I'm going to let the

139
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,870
solution set once again for eight to

140
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:05,730
twelve minutes and this time I do not

141
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:07,830
have any Hawks to do in the meantime so

142
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:09,420
I'm going to set my alarm right now on

143
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,890
at my phone and we're going to cut and I

144
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:18,210
will see you guys hopefully with some

145
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:20,250
very very fluffy brows malleus has used

146
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:22,920
the nutrition who's gonna nourish and

147
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:23,880
stimulate my eyebrows stimulate I think

148
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:27,650
the point is just again whatever

149
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,650
direction you push them in they'll go I

150
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:33,840
mean cool I feel like it kind of yeah

151
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:35,130
this is good all right you guys well I

152
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,140
think that is the eye brow and lash

153
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:39,690
lamination part of this makeup hack all

154
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:41,760
complete and I will honestly say I feel

155
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:43,560
like this was a definite success which I

156
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,450
was not expecting at all I think this

157
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,410
kit was like $40 on Amazon and I'm gonna

158
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:48,540
put the link below if any of you guys

159
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:50,670
want to actually check it out I do not

160
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:53,040
think that for me this was necessary but

161
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:55,830
I do like the result a lot I feel like

162
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:57,300
this would be so so useful to people who

163
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,740
have a little bit of thinner brows or

164
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,600
not as many brow hairs I would

165
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,610
definitely definitely recommend just

166
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,230
don't sniff a solution to number one and

167
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:05,970
you should be good to go yeah let's move

168
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:07,500
on all right you guys we're back in our

169
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:08,910
base is all on it but as you can see

170
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,130
we're looking a little bit flat we're

171
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:12,930
all one color which means it is time to

172
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:14,610
contour now normally I would describe up

173
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:16,650
my contour kit lying around and a nice

174
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:22,320
fluffy contouring brush but for today's

175
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:24,180
video we have this it looks like a

176
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,980
flamingo this PC a contouring tool and

177
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:28,950
apparently if you hook it on your ear

178
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:32,570
like this and then well contour should

179
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:32,570
never be like why would it go this way

180
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:43,860
yeah I can already say this is stupid I

181
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,300
feel like the biggest mistake that

182
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,980
people make when conjuring is they don't

183
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,450
know where to put the actual product and

184
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:49,710
like the angle of which to put it and

185
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:51,300
this doesn't help like because you could

186
00:06:49,710 --> 00:07:08,820
literally rotate this at any angle and

187
00:06:51,300 --> 00:07:11,520
put your conch parts still anywhere no

188
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:12,750
it's not no idea 3d I am so sorry

189
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,130
while I'm trying to fix this and blend

190
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,330
this out as best as I can general rule

191
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:17,040
of thumb if you were somebody at home

192
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:18,780
that has struggled with contour in the

193
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,520
past and you would ever feel like you

194
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,870
might need a hack to help you out the

195
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,250
best trick that I ever learned is to

196
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:24,900
pretend that there's a line from the top

197
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,550
of your ear to the corner of your mouth

198
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,780
and that is where you should start the

199
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,890
contour also if you literally just take

200
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,000
the end of your makeup brush they can

201
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,350
you can feel where your cheekbone is

202
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,910
mine is right here and you want to keep

203
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,440
that product right on like the base of

204
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:36,000
your cheekbone and blend upwards to

205
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,470
create a natural shadow alright you may

206
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,420
sit for the Isetta portion of this look

207
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:41,100
today I actually have a ton of different

208
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:42,300
Beauty hawks some of them I'm excited

209
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,490
about and some of them I am just

210
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,600
dreading and horrified to even try at

211
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:47,100
this point but we just need to go ahead

212
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,570
and get started and the first thing

213
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,670
we're gonna do for our shadow is of

214
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:52,170
course crabber eyeshadow palette now we

215
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:54,090
picked up this one right here that I've

216
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:55,380
seen a few different ads about and if

217
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:57,030
you open it up it just looks like a

218
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,530
plain you know eyeshadow palette there's

219
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:00,180
a ton of different colors nothing really

220
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:02,730
that special for being honest but what

221
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:05,160
makes this crazy is you actually take

222
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:07,020
off the top layer and there's some more

223
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,240
in there Plus long and then you can take

224
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:13,050
off that layer and there's even more in

225
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:15,000
there this eyeshadow palette is 250

226
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:16,800
colors for twenty to twenty dollars or

227
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,660
twenty dollars the James Charles export

228
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,770
yourself it could never of course I'm

229
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,180
laughing at this because two hundred

230
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:22,710
fifty two shades for twenty dollars

231
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,270
probably means that these shadows are

232
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,710
gonna be pretty cheap quality but we're

233
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,750
gonna give them a fair shot and try them

234
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:29,250
out and this is almost like nostalgic to

235
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:30,690
me because that the first thing that I

236
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,220
ever bought when I first started doing

237
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:33,780
makeup was one of those BH Cosmetics

238
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,070
palettes that have like a million

239
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:37,260
different colors in it I saved up for

240
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:39,000
weeks on end and I bought it and the

241
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,680
shadows were definitely not great VHS

242
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,090
shadows are really really good now so

243
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,529
they've improved quite a lot but if you

244
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:44,939
are an OG at makeup community

245
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:49,259
probably had one of these in your

246
00:08:44,939 --> 00:08:52,319
collection this is sidewalk chalk oh

247
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:53,910
this is hey I definitely want to put

248
00:08:52,319 --> 00:08:55,860
that to the test today for a finer

249
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:57,329
rainbow look since it is June it is

250
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:59,970
Pride Month happy Pride to all my fellow

251
00:08:57,329 --> 00:09:01,920
lgbtq+ sisters out there I'm sorry for

252
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:03,720
how homophobic this eye shadow look is

253
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,920
probably about to turn now so first I'm

254
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,170
gonna dip into this beautiful yellow

255
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:09,420
shade called miracles right it's gonna

256
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:11,610
really pop it onto the eye next I'm

257
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:13,439
gonna dip into this nice Tropicana shade

258
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:17,279
right up in here and we're gonna blend

259
00:09:13,439 --> 00:09:18,720
that next to the bumble bee this isn't

260
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,610
supposed to be like a pastel look but

261
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,709
like if you were going for a pastel bark

262
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:24,660
like next I'm gonna dip into the shade

263
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:28,259
called Tampa and right up in here and

264
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:31,709
we're going to and we're gonna blend it

265
00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:33,629
into emergency tablet okay so next one's

266
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:37,100
gonna dip into this a nice light pink

267
00:09:33,629 --> 00:09:37,100
shade right here called labia minora

268
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,509
this is a good nice like pastel look so

269
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,220
now I'm gonna dip into this nice green

270
00:09:42,509 --> 00:09:45,870
shade called Lima Bean right here and

271
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,970
we're going to a little bit of this one

272
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:50,779
too I just really place it now gonna dip

273
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:53,970
into this blue shade called bubble bath

274
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:55,170
yeah oh yeah every literally about a

275
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:57,629
follow up that's happening here all

276
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:58,829
jokes aside is like that's from

277
00:09:57,629 --> 00:10:00,629
literally dipping into the blue shake

278
00:09:58,829 --> 00:10:02,220
like one this is chalk the house

279
00:10:00,629 --> 00:10:03,449
downwards and then if I I'm gonna dip

280
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,430
into this nice purple shade called

281
00:10:03,449 --> 00:10:07,350
Barney was arrested and we're going to

282
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:08,879
finish off the cut crease all right so

283
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:10,379
now all the colors are laid on there and

284
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:11,519
honestly at this point it's not looking

285
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:12,540
it's too bad like I said in the

286
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,949
beginning okay this is one of like the

287
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:15,509
first products that ever bought and

288
00:10:13,949 --> 00:10:17,490
although the quality is definitely not

289
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:19,170
ideal you're able to make looks work I

290
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:20,759
mean I definitely did it I know a lot of

291
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:21,750
people out there have as well so you can

292
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:23,370
make your own decision or whether not

293
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:25,050
this makeup Hawk is a fail or a success

294
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:26,579
but anyway I decide to onto our next

295
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:28,620
thing which is going to be a cutting my

296
00:10:26,579 --> 00:10:30,929
crease and instead of using a brush and

297
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:33,360
some concealer we have this cut crease

298
00:10:30,929 --> 00:10:34,410
stamp now this for me I feel like is

299
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,300
where this look is going to go very very

300
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:37,679
self very very fast but we're gonna try

301
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,779
it out and see what we can actually do

302
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:41,339
basically you're supposed to grab you

303
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:43,019
want to like crease cutter of choice

304
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:44,519
whether it be a light concealer or like

305
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:45,959
a liner put it on here and then you

306
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:48,809
stamp it onto the eyeball and it's

307
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:50,040
supposed to be a perfect cut alright you

308
00:10:48,809 --> 00:10:54,740
guys so I just went ahead and put on my

309
00:10:50,040 --> 00:11:10,940
favorite white concealer and now me too

310
00:10:54,740 --> 00:11:12,170
oh no it Louis no it doesn't why did

311
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:13,910
this one end up so much higher than the

312
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:15,430
other one I mean come on

313
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:17,930
we knew that was gonna be a fail horse

314
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:20,000
Liza so now to set these really

315
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:21,140
beautifully cut creases in place I'm

316
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:31,550
just gonna grab this shade right here

317
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:33,589
called goat's milk our next step so this

318
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:36,170
apparently life-changing eyeliner

319
00:11:33,589 --> 00:11:38,360
product is called the flexed and now my

320
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:39,589
liner is still to this day probably the

321
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,690
thing that I get the absolute most

322
00:11:39,589 --> 00:11:42,890
questions comments team's emails about

323
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:44,870
like everyone said oh how to do their

324
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:47,660
eyeliner and it is very very tricky so I

325
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:49,070
can definitely see why a eyeliner Hawk

326
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:51,020
would be very very helpful but

327
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:53,300
apparently this flick stick is an

328
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:55,430
eyeliner stamp the tip of this marker is

329
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,959
not an actual tip it's literally it's a

330
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:58,040
stamp and it looks like the wing of an

331
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,690
eyeliner so I guess you're just supposed

332
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:02,240
to stamp this on your face and then the

333
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:05,300
other side it's a regular eyeliner I

334
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:12,800
mean it okay yeah it definitely creates

335
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:15,020
like the stamp let's see no it's not

336
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,550
let's go ahead and finish the wing using

337
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:22,100
the other side this literally feels like

338
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:23,750
I'm using a sharpie oh all right you

339
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,700
guys finally we are on to our last

340
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:27,649
makeup hack of the day and this is one

341
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:29,930
that is notorious and the makeup world

342
00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:31,490
you all I am positive at some point I've

343
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:34,070
seen an advertisement for these and

344
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:35,480
these are magnetic eyelashes now before

345
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:36,260
I even put these on I'm gonna tell you

346
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,360
spoiler alert

347
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:41,600
these are a scam and they're stupid they

348
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:45,320
do not work like why okay so these

349
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,700
eyelashes are longer on this side so I'm

350
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,440
gonna take these like this and I'm gonna

351
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:51,410
put them how do you even get them just

352
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:53,510
like to these tweezers are also metal so

353
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:54,800
the magnet is sticking to them oh I'm

354
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,280
gonna literally scream I'm getting mad

355
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:00,730
now

356
00:12:55,280 --> 00:13:00,730
[Music]

357
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:09,030
okay it this way I have had enough of

358
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:10,740
the makeup Hawks cut it quit its video

359
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:12,210
it's over weigh the Fallen all okay I

360
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:14,190
stand behind what I said in the

361
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:15,690
beginning of today's video if you were a

362
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:17,430
fellow makeup artist it really does not

363
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:18,720
matter what you want to do to get to the

364

you can use that I am fully supportive

367
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:23,970
of doing those that I would almost

368
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,110
teachers recommend checking out some

369
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,370
different channels here on YouTube and

370
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:27,510
if you do want to be an artist I would

371
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:29,160
definitely recommend learning the actual

372
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:31,350

00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,880
