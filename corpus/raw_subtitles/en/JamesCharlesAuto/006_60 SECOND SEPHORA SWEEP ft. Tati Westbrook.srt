been meaning to hop in for way too long

13
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,239
we've literally I don't know how it's

14
00:00:30,949 --> 00:00:34,320
literally was an accident so talk to you

15
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:36,600
I have actually been friends for like

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,590
two and a half years now probably she's

17
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,850
they've been here since the beginning of

18
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,739
my makeup repair she helped me move out

19
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,809
to Los Angeles I went to her in James's

20
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:44,100
wedding in Hawaii literally they flew me

21
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:46,200
there and bought me pants because I

22
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,379
could not even afford to be there which

23
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,960
is so crazy that like how far you have

24
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:53,340
come like honestly it's been like okay

25
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,030
like I'm gonna break about you on your

26
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:59,460
channel for most places who texted me I

27
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,649
remember I'm about to get married and

28
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,420
I'm all like ah you know and James was

29
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:05,670
so sweet he did my makeup it was such a

30
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,979
beautiful experience but you could not

31
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:10,470
find pants and you were so stretched

32
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:13,140
then you know YouTube hadn't become a

33
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:16,170
livable paying job yet

34
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,759
so it's just you know it's so insane to

35
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,310
see how far you've come and how far

36
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,990
you've grown and I reached out to James

37
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,900
you know way back when because he was so

38
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:30,930
mega talented and like it's so cool to

39
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:32,100
watch you know what we mean that so we

40
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:33,960
just have so much love for each other

41
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,250
and like I'm so happy to be here we've

42
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,049
been friends for three years for some

43
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,460
reason it literally this happened by

44
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:40,200
accident swear to god she's never been

45
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,280
on my channel before I haven't on her

46
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,170
staff you times we thought it was only

47
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,420
right to do something iconic for today's

48
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,640
video thank you for being here this idea

49
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,829
is actually taught to you so I live here

50
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,630
so Tati actually came up with the

51
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:53,729
craziest idea ever I have a younger

52
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,229
demographic so they were probably not

53
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:57,240
alive yet I don't know if I was alive

54
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:59,670
yet for this you don't know how many of

55
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,229
you remember supermarket sweep but it

56
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,270
used to be this game show where people

57
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:05,009
would have time to go like down the

58
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,659
aisles and they'd like you know knock

59
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:08,580
over things from the aisle into their

60
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:09,530
cards and they'd have like 60 seconds to

61
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,180
do it and

62
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:12,410
I was seeing a bunch of memes about this

63
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:16,160
and I was like oh my god it would be so

64
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:18,200
fun if we went into a Sephora and had 60

65
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,970
seconds to literally just like grab grab

66
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,850
grab grab grab to get our entire

67
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:24,890
mentality yes and sit down and have to

68
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:27,560
create a look off of that I'm nervous

69
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:29,300
I'm so ready for that like when you text

70
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,530
you this idea I was like oh my god we

71
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,390
have to do this right now

72
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:34,220
such a cool idea like a blast from the

73
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:35,720
past I watched a few clips of it last

74
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,430
night from YouTube and it sounds like

75
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,030
it's gonna be so much fun so for today's

76
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,230
video

77
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:41,780

81
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:49,760
to grab as many products as we possibly

82
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,080
can for our makeup routine have you

83
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,390

game I do I have a Saturday I have kind

85
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:56,390
of a small one but I'm I don't think we

should share it with each other no I'm

87
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:59,989
not going to but I was actually kind of

88
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:02,330

89
00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:04,850

if there's any sisters

102
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:53,150
it's like a speed bump there's so many

103
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:53,150
points

104
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:02,610

[Applause]

112
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:35,560
you got so many things I don't

113
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:40,960
understand all right sisters we are back

114
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:41,410
from Sephora and I have one gun of a few

115
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,530
things

116
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:46,240
Chucky has two entire bags of product I

117
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:48,040
would love to know what your strategy

118
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,660
was what I did is I went in and I knew

119
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,550
that if I grabbed my foundation then I

120
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:56,080
could go to like this sample type area

121
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:58,180
and just be like oh that's smart okay

122
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,790
but then I had this moment where I

123
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:02,290
totally forgot like what I had even

124
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:04,540
picked out where I kind of almost like

125
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:06,070
blacked out in the middle of Sephora and

126
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:07,390
I was like time's running out and it got

127
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:09,340
really dramatic and so I just started

128
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:10,750
like grabbing things and in the back of

129
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:12,340
my head I was like you know what I'll

130
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:14,140
just put this in a giveaway like that

131
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:15,850
low good thinking right so I was like

132
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:18,430
just go ahead overdo it because you have

133
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:19,540
no strategy you suck at this and I

134
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:24,300
really thought that you were gonna be

135
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:30,660
like well I did have a shot what was it

136
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:32,830
products you watch your opposite ma'am I

137
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:35,290
wanted to go I was gonna go right to

138
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:38,440
two-faced and then Stassi which I did

139
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:40,060
but it took me probably 20 seconds to

140
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,950
find the anasazi encounter which is an

141
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:44,380
issue but I knew by hitting them both I

142
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:45,880
could get foundation and then concealer

143
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:48,280
and then powder all from Too Faced

144
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,900
because I like the whole line the Born

145
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,670
This Way and then the peach powder and

146
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:55,570
then Anasazi I can get contour in brows

147
00:06:51,670 --> 00:07:01,570
and lip did you I misled from Anasazi

148
00:06:55,570 --> 00:07:03,100
but I have everything else so I'm gonna

149
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:04,660
have a really good base going on today

150
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:07,030
but I don't know about much else but

151
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:08,770
that's okay yeah I can go for a nice

152
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:10,690
natural look I can literally recreate

153
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:14,800
this exact oh I don't have a highlighter

154
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:17,980
I do oh wait how how did this even

155
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,510
happen that I this I think has a harness

156
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:22,600
does it oh yeah it has a highlighter

157
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:25,120
okay dude I have highlight liquid and

158
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,860
pressed from Becca what and

159
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,900
lashes I don't understand how you even

160
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:34,510
grabbed that many things like that

161
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:36,340
stolen my makeup look so pretty right

162
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:39,100
now to take it off and make it look I'm

163
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:47,080
actually having a good makeup date our

164
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:49,240
legs are so hard why because I feel like

165
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,160
you've gotten very advanced very

166
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:53,139
creative with it because I always stress

167
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:55,060
a little bit I'm like oh I hope my wing

168
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:57,010
liner is suitable to be in public with

169
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:58,449
James I won't embarrass oh my god

170
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,830
well I mean you don't see my red carpet

171
00:07:58,449 --> 00:08:02,289
in this way throwing everything on and

172
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:04,690
hoping to try to sleep eyelashes on

173
00:08:02,289 --> 00:08:07,570
leave the lashes on I will allow that

174
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:16,030
and permit it in our fake challenge of

175
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:18,699
no rules what you're kidding I don't

176
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:22,900
understand how you got everything so I

177
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:24,400
have the Dior air flash which I never

178
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:28,289
touched on before remember

179
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:30,729
I love this so much and I needed more

180
00:08:28,289 --> 00:08:32,709
this will work for me I knew what shade

181
00:08:30,729 --> 00:08:36,760
I was I didn't have to like it's a

182
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:38,409
number so it's just like oh yeah 3:01 I

183
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:40,000

why not so if you sisters follow me on

203
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,589
Twitter which if you don't you

204
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,529
definitely show because let me tell you

205
00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:24,130
my twitter is a good and first time I

206
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:28,350
voted smell some tea

207
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:28,350
so some Tati

208
00:09:29,329 --> 00:09:33,619
so I was tweeting that I was working on

209
00:09:30,619 --> 00:09:34,699
a really really big project and then I

210
00:09:33,619 --> 00:09:35,809
tweeted saying that I wasn't gonna be

211
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:37,939
doing that project because it was really

212
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:40,879
risky and I never told you what it was

213
00:09:37,939 --> 00:09:42,679
why did did I say what it was basically

214
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:44,720
right now the beauty community is in

215
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:46,309
shambles and talk to you I will happen

216
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,290
to be ones that are on the outside Chile

217
00:09:46,309 --> 00:09:50,379
having a really wonderful time living

218
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:52,730
our lives love that frost okay basically

219
00:09:50,379 --> 00:09:54,920
long story short I have not been doing

220
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:57,170
well this month for many reasons one of

221
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:59,420
the reasons being I spent an entire week

222
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:01,670
of my life planning a documentary which

223
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:03,949
is now never going to happen about the

224
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:06,739
downfall the beauty industry and why it

225
00:10:03,949 --> 00:10:08,449
is everyone it involves fault and that

226
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:10,279
may sound crazy but me and Todd you were

227
00:10:08,449 --> 00:10:11,809
actually talking a lot about it during

228
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:13,279
the planning process because it's

229
00:10:11,809 --> 00:10:14,509
obviously a very touchy subject and a

230
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,920
thing that I am really passionate about

231
00:10:14,509 --> 00:10:18,350
and I know he's really passionate about

232
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,399
so I figured for today's video while

233
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:20,989
we're like getting ready using our

234
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:22,220
products I thought it could actually be

235
00:10:20,989 --> 00:10:24,170
really interesting since we're obviously

236
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:25,759
not doing like the full-on documentary

237
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:27,259
to kind of touch on some of the things

238
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:28,699
we wanted to discuss because I feel like

239
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:30,189
we're both so really polished about it

240
00:10:28,699 --> 00:10:33,470
and like it could be fun to talk about

241
00:10:30,189 --> 00:10:35,239
also you've been in industry for a very

242
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:37,129
long time and even someone that I've

243
00:10:35,239 --> 00:10:38,329
looked up to obviously since day one and

244
00:10:37,129 --> 00:10:40,519
I'm very blessed to call you a close

245
00:10:38,329 --> 00:10:45,410
friend now but before I was here you

246
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:47,629
were here so obviously you know my

247
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:50,299
thoughts on all this but how do you feel

248
00:10:47,629 --> 00:10:52,309
about it I agree with you that there are

249
00:10:50,299 --> 00:10:54,079
so many different sides to look at it

250
00:10:52,309 --> 00:10:56,119
and that in a way everybody could be

251
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,410
doing things better like you can't just

252
00:10:56,119 --> 00:10:58,669
point fingers and be like you're doing

253
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:00,410
it bad you're doing it bad it's like

254
00:10:58,669 --> 00:11:01,970
well everybody's at fault everybody's at

255
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:03,559
fault let's kind of see where we can

256
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:05,419
adjust things like this stuff actually

257
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:08,509
makes me super uncomfortable talking

258
00:11:05,419 --> 00:11:10,489
about it but to me it's really important

259
00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:12,649
to I've had to navigate through this

260
00:11:10,489 --> 00:11:14,899
business in a very unique way I don't

261
00:11:12,649 --> 00:11:15,829
have a manager I don't have an MCN I

262
00:11:14,899 --> 00:11:18,499
don't have an agent

263
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:19,910
I do work with a lawyer if I need to go

264
00:11:18,499 --> 00:11:21,709
through contracts like I'm smart about

265
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:23,929
it yeah and that's a very unique thing

266
00:11:21,709 --> 00:11:25,639
most people do work with the team and I

267
00:11:23,929 --> 00:11:28,100
do you know I do have people that help

268
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:29,449
me out but there has been no book like

269
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,799
you don't sign up to YouTube and they're

270
00:11:29,449 --> 00:11:32,389
like here you go these are the rules

271
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:34,009
right so I think everybody's kind of

272
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:35,569
scrambling to do the right thing the

273
00:11:34,009 --> 00:11:36,470
best that they can for their audience

274
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:38,059
for themselves

275
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:41,040
it's exciting to want to work with big

276
00:11:38,059 --> 00:11:42,990
brands so I get all the excitement

277
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:46,110
and I get where people feel pressured to

278
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:48,540
not disclose but we're Adam no it's

279
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:50,970
really not that hard no it is I mean I

280
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:52,320
don't do sponsorships because really my

281
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:55,200
audience does not like them and they

282
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,820
feel that it cuts down on my level of

283
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,860
trust well that gets into the

284
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,000
conversation about the consumer for

285
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:02,010
influencers I'm saying it's not

286
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,480
physically like there's no challenge

287
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:06,480
behind posting a caption saying and this

288
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:08,550
is sponsored no but I honestly don't

289
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,340
think that I would have the success or

290
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:12,900
credibility that I have if I had done a

291
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:15,840
ton of sponsorship so I have been

292
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:18,210
someone that really has not done a ton

293
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:20,010
it's been challenging because there have

294
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:22,320
been people that will take sponsorships

295
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:24,150
and say that it hasn't been sponsored

296
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:28,200
and I know that it has because the same

297
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:29,940
we've seen the help in Atlanta it's

298
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,520
unique I think from our standpoint we

299
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:35,220
see it all and there's so much that the

300
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:37,320
audience doesn't see well I think that

301
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,790
is a huge part too in my documentary and

302
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,920
neces gonna come across as very

303
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:42,930
controversial but I believe there are

304
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,610
issues on all parts being influencers

305
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:46,230
the main thing being disclosing of

306
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:48,060
course there's lots of other factors as

307
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:49,590
well I'll talk about brands in a second

308
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,210
because that's my favorite topic but

309
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:52,680
consumers I think one of the major

310
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:54,600
issues is that there's really a

311
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:57,750
disconnect in the sense that a lot of

312
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,550
consumers hold youtubers to two

313
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:01,230
different standards at the same time and

314
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:03,390
I think that they hold youtubers at the

315
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:04,500
standards of celebrities and the sense

316
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:06,600
that they want them to have a perfect

317
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,370
track records perfect backgrounds behave

318
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:11,040
well be on a very very tight schedule

319
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:12,540
never mess up and just like be a role

320
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,100
model at the same time though a lot of

321
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:16,290
people completely disregard that

322
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,970
standard and then say that YouTube isn't

323
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:20,100
a real job that people should not be

324
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:21,840
paid anything and that people are money

325
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,790
hungry and then when people do do

326
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:25,500
sponsorships and disclose people say oh

327
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:27,360
we are selling out or oh my god like

328
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,010
well I do need money that badly or like

329
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,330
it's a little bit of a twisted system

330
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:33,330
and I think that at the end of the day

331
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:35,280
consumers are consumers and it sounds

332
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:37,020
really blunt and stupid to say but it's

333
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,700
like consumers get to choose what they

334
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:40,770
want to consume and at the end of the

335
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,210
day it's up to the consumers you sisters

336
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:44,670
at home watching to make an educated

337
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:46,110
decision on who you want to watch who

338
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:47,820
you want to support what brands you want

339
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:49,680
to buy from and that's that on that like

340
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,610
there's there's no I actually I feel

341
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,350
similar I

342
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:54,180
get that there's just no way to dice it

343
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:55,260
we are role models I think that's

344
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,670
something you do have to be mindful of

345
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,500
if you're in this business is that you

346
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:01,380
have a lot of eyes on you whether you

347
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:03,300
like it or not right you are in some way

348
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:05,730
shaping the world which sounds really

349
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:08,519
crazy but when you have millions of

350
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:10,890
people watching and you are you know

351
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:13,050
sharing your opinion and whatnot like we

352
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:14,700
are role models but yes

353
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:16,560
it is up to the consumer to really

354
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:18,329
decide and do research and not just go

355
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,040
down one Avenue I think that a lot of

356
00:14:18,329 --> 00:14:22,230
people have gotten overexcited and maybe

357
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:24,120
they say yes too often like wait last

358
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:26,610
month you loved that Foundation and this

359
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,560
month you love this one and which one is

360
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:31,230
it right and if it's not just like

361
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,670
constant review constant review you know

362
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:34,740
I do a five-day week show so I'm

363
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:36,540
constantly in product it's not

364
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:38,399
necessarily stuff I use and travel with

365
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:40,320
every single day I'm just kind of

366
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,000
breaking it down and giving you my

367
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,940
immediate feedback so that's kind of my

368
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,990
gig so my whole thing is I wish that our

369
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:48,600
community was a little bit more

370
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:50,339
selective and I think sometimes it's the

371
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,930
managers that are a little aggressive

372
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:53,730
because they're making money off of us

373
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:56,730
too I'm gonna go to the peach powder

374
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:58,740
while we talk you brought our brands and

375
00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:01,260
this is a topic that I am very

376
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:02,760
passionate about okay obviously you know

377
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:04,230
this and all the sisters on this too my

378
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,180
biggest passion aside from makeup is

379
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:07,380
marketing yeah and I really like

380
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,850
business it's like my favorite thing to

381
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:11,100
do I'm just very passionate about it I

382
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:12,510
like the inner thank you that means a

383
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,680
lot I just really like the inner working

384
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:16,620
as in things it's always very much

385
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:19,890
interested me and the business of beauty

386
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:22,490
is something that is really messed up on

387
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:26,010
a lot of different levels that's a very

388
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:27,660
broken system it sure is

389
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:29,519
I think the major thing with brands and

390
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:31,800
beauty is that a lot of brands and I'm

391
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,970
not naming anybody specific so don't

392
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,829
even try to start down with this I'm

393
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:36,959
speaking very generally because the

394
00:15:34,829 --> 00:15:39,360
reality is this is - a lot of different

395
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,670
brands a lot of brands don't really know

396
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,250
how to target their right demographic

397
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:46,050
and therefore spend their advertising

398
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,190
dollars in the wrong way I can't believe

399
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:49,920
I'm even gonna discuss this on camera

400
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:51,149
but honestly might as well there was a

401
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,949
video that just went up recently by

402
00:15:51,149 --> 00:15:55,170
Marlene Estelle the owner of makeup geek

403
00:15:52,949 --> 00:15:57,240
and it was talking about her truth of

404
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:58,829
the industry it really created quite the

405
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,260
rock ass makeup gigas brand that I've

406
00:15:58,829 --> 00:16:02,370
loved since day one I really were just a

407
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,050
lot of their shadows they're one of the

408
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:04,550
first bands that

409
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:06,529
I thought their shadows were phenomenal

410
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:08,830
over the past year makeup geek is kind

411
00:16:06,529 --> 00:16:10,790
of like slowly slipped under the radar

412
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:11,870
and like the beauty fades people don't

413
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:15,230
really talk about them that much anymore

414
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:16,760
and Marlena made her video about her

415
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:18,260
truth for the beauty industry I actually

416
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,490
agree with a lot of the points that she

417
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,630
was making in the video wanting to

418
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:24,709
support smaller artists and like the

419
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:25,820
industry changing forget it and but

420
00:16:24,709 --> 00:16:27,920
there was one thing that she said in the

421
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:29,870
video that literally like shook up the

422
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,269
beauty industry so much she basically

423
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:34,130
said that makeup geek is failing because

424
00:16:32,269 --> 00:16:35,930
of the fact that she refuses to charge

425
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:37,220
big influencers 60 thousand dollars

426
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:39,890
which is the rate that she's been given

427
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:42,110
because of that personal thing that

428
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:44,570
happened and her being on video the

429
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:46,970
whole 60-thousand thing created a witch

430
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:49,459
hunt against influencers and i have

431
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:51,740
never had so many hate comments on

432
00:16:49,459 --> 00:16:53,000
videos about product placement before

433
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:55,430
you really don't do that many

434
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,350
sponsorships I don't make it haunted

435
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:58,910
like because I was like gosh you know am

436
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:01,700
I am I in this like I don't really know

437
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:04,069
out of the past hundred and twenty

438
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:08,030
videos that I have produced look I

439
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:10,429
believe there is six maybe six maybe

440
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:12,079
seven yeah um you know and they weren't

441
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:13,520
and I I don't even think all of those

442
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:17,510
were dedicated videos they're just like

443
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:20,209
mentions yeah so I really I try so hard

444
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:22,220
to run my business in a way that makes

445
00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:24,620
sense where I can support my own brand

446
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:26,510
which I invested everything in myself I

447
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:28,370
don't have any outside funding I wanted

448
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:30,559
to run it in my way so I've worked

449
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:32,830
really hard to be smart support brands I

450
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:35,150
love be smart about that know my worth

451
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:37,040
like I've done this in it in the right

452
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:38,750
way and like you have done this in the

453
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,790
right way to where you're so creative

454
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:42,559
you pour everything into your channel

455
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:43,910
you have to have financial support

456
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,590
somewhere because you do have to pay for

457
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:47,300
your team yes you do have to pay for the

458
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:49,700
lights you do have to pay for the makeup

459
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:51,530
you do have a lot of expenses so once

460
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:53,600
you get to this level it is it's very

461
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:55,340
expensive to run a business and I will

462
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,809
the reason I didn't do the documentary

463
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:59,990
is because I truly believe that this

464
00:17:56,809 --> 00:18:01,669
industry is based on ignorance and the

465
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:03,470
people believing that this is just like

466
00:18:01,669 --> 00:18:04,640
a really good time of people that they

467
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:05,780
love and look up to just putting on

468
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,910
makeup and calling it a day

469
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:09,050
when in reality this is a business if

470
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:10,730
you don't want to look at it that way

471
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:11,960
that's fine because you can just enjoy

472
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:13,880
the content we're working hard for you

473
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,080
guys we're obviously here to make

474
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,940
everybody happy like it's what we love

475
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,230
doing

476
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:19,629
you can't accept the fact that this is a

477
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:22,389
business I don't to tell you and the

478
00:18:19,629 --> 00:18:24,909
60,000 was thrown around and it was such

479
00:18:22,389 --> 00:18:27,669
a controversial number because $60,000

480
00:18:24,909 --> 00:18:28,870
is so much money but I will say the best

481
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:30,100
way I can think about it is this goes

482
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:31,600
back to the consumers a lot of the

483
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,710
consumers say you tubers should not be

484
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,759
paid this they're just setting for

485
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:35,799
Medicare they don't deserve to make any

486
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:38,379
money okay fine you want to think that

487
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:40,000
great consumers are the ones spending

488
00:18:38,379 --> 00:18:41,679
the money so consumers are the ones who

489
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,509
buy makeup and it's unrealistic to just

490
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,559
say if you hate the beauty industry stop

491
00:18:43,509 --> 00:18:46,149
buying makeup because it's never gonna

492
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,009
happen it's a billion dollar industry

493
00:18:46,149 --> 00:18:50,830
consumers are the ones who put the money

494
00:18:48,009 --> 00:18:53,470
in the brands pockets and the brands

495
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:55,929
help to advertise brands that don't

496
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:58,360
advertise fall under the radar and all

497
00:18:55,929 --> 00:19:02,070
brands have advertising budget every

498
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:04,779
single brand ever as a mine what

499
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:06,309
most brands well you're the advertising

500
00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:08,259
budget but you just don't have to pay

501
00:19:06,309 --> 00:19:09,580
for because it's you feel bad for me of

502
00:19:08,259 --> 00:19:11,440
no budget yes

503
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:13,690
I've already been taking mine so I'm on

504
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,820
I only have a few days left in my bag it

505
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:18,490
is true though okay jokes aside most

506
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:21,250
brands have huge budgets and what they

507
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:23,230
spend in traditional media would be you

508
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:24,490
would just be Shh right so think about

509
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:26,440
it this way if a brand wants to do a

510
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:28,929
campaign right say influences are off

511
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:30,370
the table we hate influencers buy your

512
00:19:28,929 --> 00:19:32,289
jobs over that leaves a brand to do a

513
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:33,100
traditional media campaign I'm going off

514
00:19:32,289 --> 00:19:34,360
on this this is something I'm very

515
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,649
passionate about you want to do a

516
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,029
traditional media campaign you don't

517
00:19:35,649 --> 00:19:38,320
have to assign the work to the people

518
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:40,000
that are in your internal team and they

519
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,889
have to plan the whole campaign great

520
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,509
once the campaign is planned you have to

521
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:45,309
rent a studio space which is very very

522
00:19:43,509 --> 00:19:47,169
expensive in Los Angeles then you have

523
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:49,210
to rent all of the equipment you have to

524
00:19:47,169 --> 00:19:51,100
hire a videographer you have to hire a

525
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:53,139
photographer you have to hire a producer

526
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:54,820
you have to hire all the models and pay

527
00:19:53,139 --> 00:19:56,799
their day rate you have to hire hair and

528
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:58,629
makeup to do their entire faces to get

529
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,159
them ready for the commercial you have

530
00:19:58,629 --> 00:20:02,019
to hire an editor to then work on the

531
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:03,340
finished product and higher probably

532
00:20:02,019 --> 00:20:05,019
assistants to help you and make sure

533
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:06,220
that the set day runs smoothly that's

534
00:20:05,019 --> 00:20:07,389
why we're gonna cost upwards of like two

535
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:09,909
hundred to three hundred thousand

536
00:20:07,389 --> 00:20:11,320
dollars per day of shooting that's true

537
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:12,759
but that's not it because then once you

538
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,529
have the finished commercial fully done

539
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:16,120
it's not just gonna sit on your little

540
00:20:14,529 --> 00:20:17,950
flash drive at your desk you actually

541
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,480
have to get it shown and that's what the

542
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:21,519
things get really pricey because then

543
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:23,889
these brands have to pay for advertising

544
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:25,240
space and let me tell you because this

545
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:28,120
is a constant battle that youtubers are

546
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:30,850
always fighting advertising is very ver

547
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:32,380
expensive to get ads running on TV

548
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:34,090
networks on popular channels during the

549
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:36,520
Superbowl it cost several hundred

550
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:38,650
thousand dollars for a few seconds so

551
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:40,210
you probably spent let's say five

552
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:43,060
hundred thousand dollars to get this

553
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:44,140
commercial made and now shown right and

554
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:46,300
your goal is to make a million dollars

555
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:49,600
of sales your profit margin has now been

556
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:50,980
50 percent this is a lot of math it is

557
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,420
and this model has been around for

558
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:54,550
hundreds and hundreds of years and it's

559
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:57,820
worked very very well for major brands

560
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:59,110
so a brand pays an influencer back to

561
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:00,640
the original decision brain wants to do

562
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:02,170
a campaign traditional media buy

563
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,400
influences are back you get your job

564
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:04,690
back you're welcome you want to do it

565
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,310
camp into that influence are great so

566
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:08,560
they say hey James we want you to do a

567
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:09,850
video about our product right they don't

568
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,720
have to pay for the studio space because

569
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,860
it's already in the house

570
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,000
and they'd have to pay for the equipment

571
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:14,770
because it's already in the house they'd

572
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,050
have to pay for the videographer editor

573
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:19,150
photographer or model because that's

574
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:21,310
already the influencers job they do that

575
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:22,870
already on YouTube once the video is

576
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:24,250
already fully produced they don't have

577
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:26,410
to pay for advertising space either

578
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:28,210
because the YouTube channel of the

579
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,890
influencer is already getting viewed by

580
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:31,420
millions of people say the brand's -

581
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:33,430
let's make a million dollars dr.

582
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:35,530
Martinez video they pay said influencer

583
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:38,440
at sixty thousand dollars their profit

584
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:40,870
margin is now at ninety four percent why

585
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:43,390
in any way shape or form what a brand

586
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:45,370
pay five hundred thousand dollars when

587
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:48,310
they could pay sixty thousand dollars

588
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:50,110
and get a very same if not maybe even

589
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:51,700
better because right now a lot of people

590
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:54,670
are looking to influencers for true

591
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:55,540
honest reviews result yes why it doesn't

592
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:56,920
make any sense

593
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:58,240
influencer marketing regardless of

594
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:00,940
whatever your personal opinion on it

595
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,380
maybe it's a system that works it's a

596
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:03,790
system that is very very efficient and

597
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:05,680
is a system that is very very cost

598
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:07,240
effective and it's probably not going to

599
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:09,130
go away for a very very long time

600
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:11,920
so I think it's up to the public to

601
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:14,050
educate themselves on it and not hate it

602
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:15,910
because it's not the influencers problem

603
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:17,830
that they're taking a deal if the fact

604
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:19,870
that advertising exists in every single

605
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:22,570
industry and the beauty industry is a

606
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:23,680
billion dollar industry and everybody

607
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:25,900
needs to make money and support

608
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:27,550
themselves somehow from the consumer to

609
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:29,140
the influencer to also the brand owner I

610
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:31,930
think that you have to look at the

611
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:34,480
realistic overall you know math of

612
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:37,240
everything and again it gets a little

613
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:39,460
bit cluttered when you look at one

614
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:41,590
person who has X amount reach another

615
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:43,600
person has a different reach

616
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:46,240
really like throwing out a broad number

617
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:48,159
like 60k made everybody feel like that

618
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,720
was just a universal number for every

619
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,980
single person words of content and

620
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,860
that's just not the case I was just very

621
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:55,179
irresponsible if I'm I yeah well I mean

622
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:57,039
I have to agree with that

623
00:22:55,179 --> 00:22:59,289
I like Marlena I've loved her products

624
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:01,360
for so long you know I put in my truth

625
00:22:59,289 --> 00:23:02,830
video an email exchange not wanting

626
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,179
money from her I think a lot of people

627
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:06,159
have loved her brand a lot of people

628
00:23:04,179 --> 00:23:07,450
have loved her product I think she

629
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:11,110
probably has a lot of frustration with

630
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:14,649
you know relationships falling apart

631
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:16,870
like that whole behind the scenes I'm

632
00:23:14,649 --> 00:23:18,070
not gonna get into no it's nobody's

633
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:20,770
nobody's business

634
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:23,140
I mean I have so much that I could just

635
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:24,610
lay out on my channel all the time but

636
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:26,289
it's just not appropriate because you

637
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:27,970
guys don't come to see me for that you

638
00:23:26,289 --> 00:23:30,730
come for reviews you come to escape the

639
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:33,330
world right I do my best to not throw

640
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:36,340
all of that information that's private

641
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:37,690
your way to confuse you so I do agree

642
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:39,010
with that number being thrown around was

643
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:41,500
kind of like wait what whoa

644
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:44,380
it stirred up a lot of dirt it really

645
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:45,909
did it started this weird tension of

646
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:49,570
what's the right way to do this business

647
00:23:45,909 --> 00:23:51,490
and everyone can do it their own way

648
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:54,250
yeah you know and as long as you are

649
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:56,140
being honest with your subscribers great

650
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:58,059
I think that the influencers need to be

651
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:59,500
more honest and I need to be very open

652
00:23:58,059 --> 00:24:00,460
when they're doing sponsorships I think

653
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,570
the influencer should only take

654
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:03,610
sponsorships when it's a product that

655
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:04,750
they actually care about one I think it

656
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:06,909
makes everybody else look really bad

657
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:08,860
yeah - you're deluding everybody else's

658
00:24:06,909 --> 00:24:10,299
rate card three you're gonna lose the

659
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:11,919
trust of your own subscriber so you're

660
00:24:10,299 --> 00:24:13,570
yes there's my piece of advice for you

661
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,460
you're ruining it for yourself as for

662
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:17,080
brands I think that they need to do a

663
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:18,880
better job of educating themselves on

664
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,380
how marketing works and who they want to

665
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,299
work with hiring some five million

666
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:23,980
followers and they're getting 10,000

667
00:24:22,299 --> 00:24:25,090
likes that engagement is very very low

668
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:26,679
and it's probably not someone who's

669
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:28,270
going to make you that money back

670
00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:29,440
whereas you can hire someone with five

671
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:31,059
million followers that's getting five

672
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,470
hundred thousand likes 10% engagement

673
00:24:31,059 --> 00:24:34,450
which is usually a very good a typical

674
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:36,640
number you're probably gonna make your

675
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:38,230
money back it's up to the brand make the

676
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,330
right decision do your research on who

677
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:41,679
is doing well who's name is being talked

678
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:43,600
about a lot and who has good engagement

679
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,669
and who can really convert to sales and

680
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,140
it's for the consumers make an educated

681
00:24:45,669 --> 00:24:49,059
decision on the industry that you're

682
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:50,200
supporting pick people that you want to

683
00:24:49,059 --> 00:24:51,820
watch that you believe are generally

684
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,899
here for the right reasons pick people

685
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,940
that you see working really really hard

686
00:24:52,899 --> 00:24:56,440
there's nothing wrong with doing

687
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:57,790
answer ships as long as you truly

688
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,960
believe that they like the product and

689
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:01,600
one thing and that's up to you as a

690
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,100
consumer to decide how January they're

691
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,630
actually being also at the same time

692
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:06,280
though mine here on business

693
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:07,870
love you sisters the most you guys are

694
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:09,490
very good about this I'm not saying this

695
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:10,930
is you but it's a general issue in the

696
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:12,100
beauty community these numbers should

697
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:13,270
have never even been brought to the

698
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,680
surface in the first place

699
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:17,860
there were nobody's business and I think

700
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:19,120
it's very responsible no and I think

701
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:21,310
because it's out there that's why I feel

702
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,870
ok to discuss it it's a business whether

703
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:24,640
you want to admit it or not and of

704
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:26,530
course yes I'm here to inspire people

705
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,420
and to make people happy trust me I

706
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:30,250
would not be here anymore if it was not

707
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:32,350
for that because this job behind the

708
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:33,910
scenes can be so insane so I am gonna

709
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:36,220
touch on the whole you know this is a

710
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:38,380
job this is a business you know for me I

711
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:40,540
have employees I do have to show up to

712
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:43,330
work every day there's just no different

713
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:45,220
way to slice it so I do approach this as

714
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:46,660
a business and I take it very seriously

715
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:48,250
and that doesn't mean that I'm not

716
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:51,040
passionate about it that doesn't mean I

717
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:52,840
don't love it it just means that this is

718
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:54,940
something really incredible that turned

719
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:57,100
into the best job ever and I'm not

720
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:59,050
ashamed of that you know you shouldn't

721
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:01,270
be either but so many people are and

722
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:03,490
they're like oh I hate that YouTube

723
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:05,860
feels like a job you know and it's like

724
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:09,550
well but it's the best job it is you

725
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:11,200
know and I feel really privileged so on

726
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:12,910
one hand I feel like oh my gosh I'm so

727
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:16,000
grateful I don't want anybody to get the

728
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:19,150
vibe then I'm not but there are a lot of

729
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,640
things that are very stressful and they

730
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:23,500
give us just a feeling of pressure a lot

731
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:25,000
of the time and I think that number

732
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:27,430
being released kind of made us all feel

733
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,440
like oh my God we're all the bad guy we

734
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:31,870
should feel horrible when that was just

735
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:34,150
one isolated incident and I think as far

736
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:36,820
as ROI goes for business

737
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:39,790
you are so spot-on with that like I

738
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:42,100
really feel that brands need to do more

739
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:43,810
education don't be afraid to ask for

740
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,340
analytics they're there I think these

741
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:46,870
issues are all very fixable

742
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,830
I think everybody just had a little bit

743
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:50,020
more respect for everybody else

744
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:51,610
everybody did their proper research on

745
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:53,050
who they want to support who they want

746
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,580
to buy from who they want to watch

747
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:56,770
this industry would be much better off

748
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:58,270
and I really just wish everybody would

749
00:26:56,770 --> 00:27:00,180
stop being greedy whether it be for

750
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:03,030
money for brand deals or for information

751
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:05,870
and just get back to what it really is

752
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:07,550
it's just makeup I think that we

753
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:09,320
move in a more positive direction and I

754
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:10,580
think the community it needs to be more

755
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:12,140
respectful of each other instead of

756
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:14,270
pointing fingers and playing the blame

757
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:16,760
game because like we're all in this

758
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:18,920
together and I don't like hearing that

759
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:21,200
the community is falling apart you can

760
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:23,240
only trust yourself like I try so hard

761
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,710
to not be jaded in this community right

762
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:27,500
like you have to keep some openness

763
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:29,030
about you yeah right and you have to

764
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,680
believe that there can be good and I

765
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:32,720
think we have the best job on earth and

766
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:34,250
it it's so exciting and we're so blessed

767
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,320
that doesn't mean it's not hard it

768
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:40,190
doesn't mean it's not a ton of work and

769
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:42,410
a ton of pressure but it is good and you

770
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:45,020
guys give us that and I am so grateful

771
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:47,480
and James is so grateful I just think

772
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:49,160
people are tired of being dragged you

773
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,840
know in every which direction it's like

774
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:53,780
hey let's all have a better attitude

775
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:55,970
about it let's all disclose let's all be

776
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:57,440
a little not honest and let's all see

777
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:59,600
you're a part of it instead of pointing

778
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,010
a finger at everybody else amen and the

779
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,840
setting sprays coming through that's

780
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:04,370
gonna say speaking of makeup let's go

781
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:06,200
back to our makeup I'm almost done with

782
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:07,400
my routine because I only have because

783
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,800

871
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:26,820
like little business conversation I know

872
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:28,830
this is not planned

873
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:30,420
like came out of nowhere I was like hey

874
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:33,690
I was thinking of this thing let's chat

875
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:34,800
about this is a topic that I know both

876
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:36,360
Dante and I are very very passionate

877
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:38,040
about this industry something that we

878
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,750
care a lot about I mean clearly it shows

879
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:41,580
this woman has been here for eight years

880
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:43,290
Asli killing it being such a huge role

881
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:46,290
model to me and everybody else involved

882
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:47,550
and it's an industry that we don't want

883
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:49,410
to see fail and right now I feel like

884
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:51,420
it's in a very very uncomfortable and

885
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:52,410
weird place and everybody has just a

886
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,580
little bit of a weird feeling in their

887
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:55,830
heart so I just wanted to address these

888
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:57,210
issues head-on because I went from being

889
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:59,310
someone who literally could not even

890
00:31:57,210 --> 00:32:00,930
afford to buy makeup to being a smaller

891
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:02,490
influencer to being a bigger influencer

892
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:04,290
to then being at the level of literally

893
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:06,420
working on consulting and marketing with

894
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:08,640
these brands so I've seen all aspects of

895
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:09,090
it and I truly believe that it can be

896
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,410
fixed

897
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:12,690
I believe that we're all here for one

898
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:13,830
shared life yeah being makeup and I just

899
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:15,900
want to see it go back to that and

900
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:17,610
everybody has to work hard and put food

901
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:19,890
on the table and nobody can eat lipstick

902
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:22,020
forever so let's leave it at that

903
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:23,580
also amen yeah if you like my sister's
