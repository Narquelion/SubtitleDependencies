00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,049
hi sisters James Charles here and

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,279
welcome back to my youtube channel so if

3
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:07,230
he wants to go I did a video on my

4
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,330
channel called testing a fake makeup

5
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,650
where I went down to Santee alley and if

6
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,540
you are an alley native you know that

7
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,190
that is like the holy grail of all fake

8
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,139
products and all I can knock off or

9
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,820
really really cheap goods and I did a

10
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:19,500
video testing out fake makeup products

11
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,750
where I did like knockoffs of all like

12
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,010
high-end name-brand stuff you guys

13
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,180
absolutely love that video and there's

14
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,650
one of the most dude on my entire

15
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,330
channel so thank you for that and I got

16
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,740
so many comments ask me to do it again

17
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,910
and what are the main comments that I

18
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,590
got in the video as well as that I

19
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,820
should have gotten the real versions of

20
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,410
all the fake products and tested them

21
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,930
out half and half which I was like oh

22
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:39,660
yeah that would've been a really smart

23
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:42,270
idea so today I'm coming at you with a

24
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,710
part two of testing fake makeup I have a

25
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,210
ton of new products that I do not try

26
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,710
out in the last video the real versions

27
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,600
and the fake versions as well so we're

28
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,010
gonna do half and half and compare how

29
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,260
the real products compared to the fake

30
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:58,920
ones so yeah without further ado let's

31
00:00:52,260 --> 00:01:00,359
go ahead and get started so I actually

32
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,710
don't have any base products that test

33
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:03,539
out for you guys the only foundation

34
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,189
that I've ever seen a fake version of is

35
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:08,130
the Mac one that I used in last video

36
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:09,869
but what I do have is a knockoff Beauty

37
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:11,189
Blender that I found so I'm gonna go

38
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:13,049
ahead and use a knockoff Beauty Blender

39
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:14,250
and a real Beauty Blender on different

40
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:15,390
sides of my face using my regular

41
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,340
foundation and we're gonna see how they

42
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,259
actually apply if they apply the same if

43
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,490
they're different so yeah what I find

44
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:22,049
weirdest about this knockoff Beauty

45
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,270
Blender is the fact that it comes in a

46
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:25,650
plastic package that literally says the

47
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:27,090
original Beauty Blender and I've had at

48
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,369
many Beauty blenders in the past and

49
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,479
this is literally the same exact plastic

50
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:32,400
packaging that the regular Beauty

51
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,960
Blender has come in which is very very

52
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,509
suspicious but if you take the actual

53
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,670
sponge out it is definitely a different

54
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:41,189
shade of pink a different shape as well

55
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:43,979
this one is slightly more fat and the

56
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:45,360
texture is completely different Oh God

57
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:47,520
alright so these are both completely

58
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,780
soaked and then wrung out this is

59
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,549
obviously the fake one it has not

60
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,869
changed in size in the slightest and

61
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:54,450
this is the real Beauty Blender which is

62
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:55,829
now like probably doubled in size so I'm

63
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,000
gonna grab my Too Faced Born This Way

64
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:58,530
Foundation which is only a longtime

65
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,880
favorites right now and just pump a

66
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,799
little bit on the back of my hand and

67
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,390
then we're going to apply it so this is

68
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,340
literally incredibly hard and not like

69
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,899
remotely comfortable in the slightest

70
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,429
you know makeup gurus are always coming

71
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:10,830
and I'm beating my face like I am

72
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:12,599
literally having to beat my face at this

73
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:14,099
product I'm gonna go ahead and now grab

74
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:15,330
my real Beauty Blender into the Born

75
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:22,440
This Way Foundation and do the rest of

76
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:23,819
my face oh so much better so the non

77
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,860
Beauty Blender i bought at Sanchi alley

78
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:27,330
for a total of nine dollars and the real

79
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,819
Beauty Blender retails at like most

80
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,200
makeup stores for I think $20 obviously

81
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:32,790
you are saving money by getting the fake

82
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,590
version but clearly it is not really

83
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:36,209
working out that well for me you have to

84
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:37,530
blend it out really really really hard

85
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:38,970
and just soak up a lot of projects as

86
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,560
well so ultimately at the end of the day

87
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:41,910
you're just losing money because you are

88
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,200
using more your foundation and I'm

89
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,700
assuming your concealer when we get to

90
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,650
that stuff in a second which I am

91
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,989
literally horrified for but literally to

92
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:50,220
spend the extra $11 if you have it of

93
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:52,170
course and get the real version because

94
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,400
it pays off so much better so like I

95
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:55,290
said with the foundation I didn't find

96
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,670
any base dupes so I'm gonna go ahead and

97
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:58,379
use the Tarte shaped tip concealer in

98
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,580
the shade light/medium on both sides

99
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:00,780
then we're just gonna use the different

100
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,000
Beauty blenders to blend them out

101
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,290
I'm literally hitting myself so hard to

102
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,060
actually like blend out and distribute

103
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:07,739
this product which is not what I want to

104
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,450
be doing right now using the original

105
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:11,519
issue so much more effortless and not as

106
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:13,050
violent alright so now that the base is

107
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,610
all on our next step is going to be to

108
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:16,440
powder and once again you guys know that

109
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,730
I love my Beauty Blender for this so I

110
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,110
just have my regular Laura Mercier

111
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:21,209
translucent setting powder and I'm gonna

112
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:23,670
first got my knocked off Beauty Blender

113
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:25,080
and dip into the powder and I am so

114
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:28,500
horrified for this one being first gonna

115
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,670
do my nose on the fake half Oh God

116
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,500
normally when I do with my regular

117
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:33,000
Beauty Blender it really helps to melt

118
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,980
the powder into the skin which creates a

119
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,720
really flawless finish I am definitely

120
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,519
not achieving that with this sponge at

121
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,920
all which is why I'm getting like a lot

122
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:43,140
of excess and residue powder on my nose

123
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,940
under my eyes as you can see posh like

124
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:49,080
Mary is trying to come back today and we

125
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:50,879
are not about to have that happen so I

126
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,010
face is aweso and I am currently baking

127
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,840
at 350 degrees to my face locked in

128
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:56,640
place and all snapped and ready to go

129
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,560
and of course the next step along always

130
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,510
baking is my eyebrows and I do have a

131
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,900
knockout product for those and that is

132
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:05,340
the Anastasia brow definer now I did

133
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,170
have a bra definer in the same exact

134
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,239
shade and I got dark brown and the fake

135
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:11,790
one but I just put on a trip and

136
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:13,019
happened to leave mine there so I had to

137
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:14,220
improvise and instead of using the brow

138
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:16,440
definer today I'm gonna use the

139
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:18,390
Broadway's they are both in the shade of

140
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,470
dark brown I figured the actual shaper

141
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,940
the product doesn't really matter that

142
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:22,740
much I'm just gonna compare it to color

143
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,810
the price and the firm tool and how they

144
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,970
actually look on the brows you guys get

145
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:28,080
the point my dumb master shouldn't have

146
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,030
lost their product in the first place

147
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,590
let's go ahead and swatch it on my hand

148
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:34,080
to actually see how the colors compare

149
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:39,060
so this is the dark brown brown define

150
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:40,470
our oh wow okay so the forma is super

151
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,630
super soft as you can see it just broke

152
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:45,060
off almost instantly swatching this on

153
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:46,140
my hand I'm gonna try that again so as

154
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,730
you guys can see I just went ahead and

155
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:49,980
applied the real of dark brown for about

156
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:52,230
from honest Asya and the fake dark brown

157
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:54,540
is actually darker Brown and the real

158
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:56,100
dark brown from actually I besides you

159
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,120
know this is a mess that you guys should

160
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,310
understand what I'm saying at this point

161
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,410
and the real dark brown is actually a

162
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:03,300
lot more gray toned and the fake dark

163
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:04,710
brown as well this is a definitely has a

164
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,720
more red undertone so this is definitely

165
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:08,820
look like more realistic brown hairs on

166
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,440
the real side but let's go ahead and

167
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,700
apply the fake version to the left side

168
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,169
and the real version to the right side

169
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,760
like we did with the Beauty blenders and

170
00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:16,169
let's see which one actually applies it

171
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,840
better when I'm instantly noticing right

172
00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:21,450
away - is that the point on the fake oh

173
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,490
my god ow the point of the actual like

174
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:25,650
tip of the product is not nearly as

175
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:27,870
sharp or defined despite the fact that

176
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:29,669
it is the Anasazi a brow definer as the

177
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:31,410
original version I'm applying these

178
00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:33,810
lines and they're coming out very very

179
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:35,880
thick and usually I'm able to get a very

180
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:38,430
very sharp edge which makes my brow look

181
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,720
super super chiseled out but as you can

182
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:41,610
see looking at the tail right here it is

183
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:47,970
not chiseled out in the slightest it

184
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:51,150
looks very very messy oh you're kidding

185
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:52,860
No okay this eyebrows will be like

186
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:54,840
throwback to original Jade Charles

187
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,690
Beauty Instagram block eyebrows this

188
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,620
looks the worst normally I would go

189
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,880
ahead and do my other brow and then

190
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,470
conceal after but either way cannot

191
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,820
stand to look at this any longer I'm

192
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:04,260
gonna grab some charts shaved and just

193
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,770
fixed up with my morphe for anything you

194
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:09,570
brush as always because this is looking

195
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:11,970
I don't think I've ever had to work at

196
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:13,650
fixing an eyebrow that badly ever like

197
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:16,440
in my entire life as a makeup artist

198
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:18,060
that took like at least 30 minutes to do

199
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,979
this one eyebrow and that should never

200
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,390
ever be the case like I get something to

201
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:23,400
finish my entire makeup routine in 30

202
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:24,870
minutes if I'm really going fast so that

203
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,090
was awful I definitely would not

204
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:27,930
recommend this wanna be asked brow

205
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:30,300
definer from

206
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:32,160
Anasazi of Beverly Hills I think this is

207
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,510
a total of 14 dollars at Santee alley

208
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,150
and I think the regular one retails for

209
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:38,820
21 dollars so definitely would not

210
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:40,770
recommend her at all come with the

211
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:42,210
original because you don't want to end

212
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:43,860
up with a block eyebrow from the

213
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:45,990
original J Charles Beauty on Instagram

214
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:48,270
those are dark days and we are so glad

215
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:50,340
to be away from them let's not go back I

216
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:52,500
think today for the first time ever my

217
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,820
right eyebrow is my better brow today

218
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,160
I don't know this fake bride a finer

219
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:57,870
just really did not do it for me but the

220
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,880
original brow was came to slay and came

221
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:01,290
to safe today let's go ahead and move on

222
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,850
from the brows thank god we've been on

223
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:04,590
the step for way too long and move on to

224
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:05,670
the eye shadow so for the eyes today

225
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,200
we're gonna be using one palette that I

226
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:08,880
absolutely stand by interviews many

227
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,070
times on this channel and that is the

228
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,930
morphe brushes collaboration with Jaclyn

229
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:15,330
hill the real version is in this hand

230
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:17,700
and is $38 at morphe brushes dot-com or

231
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:19,230
if you news code change for 10% off and

232
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:21,510
then there's the fake version which I

233
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:24,420
got at San cially for a total of $12 so

234
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:25,710
I definitely price different but let's

235
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:27,660
put it actually see if the quality is

236
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:29,730
different because let's be real they're

237
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:31,830
probably gonna be a lot of the colors do

238
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:33,690
look very very similar but there are

239
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:35,670
some huge noticeable differences such as

240
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:37,530
this shade right here I mean this is a

241
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:39,150
shimmery Bravo highlighting how it and

242
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:40,710
this is like literally a bright awesome

243
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:42,450
neon chartreuse color which is

244
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:44,580
definitely not even close to what it is

245
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:46,320
supposed to be this gold shade and the

246
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:48,510
fake version is nowhere near to the gold

247
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,860
in the original wide this dark brown

248
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:51,660
shape in the original color which is a

249
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:59,130
brownie red undertone is loading another

250
00:07:51,660 --> 00:08:00,780
black in the fake palate so oh yeah so

251
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:02,460
this one obviously is the real version

252
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:04,170
is much more pigmented and the color is

253
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,970
much deeper and more defined as well

254
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:07,830
whereas the fake version definitely is

255
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:09,900
not nearly as shimmery as the real one

256
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:12,060
it did honestly swatch much farther than

257
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,830
I was expected it's not like awful by

258
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:16,080
any means but clearly the original

259
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:17,070
palette is a lot better this is the brow

260
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,319
bone highlighting shade which is

261
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:21,539
absolutely stunning I love this color

262
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:22,860
and this is the brow bone highlighting

263
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:25,680
shade from the fake palette which is

264
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:28,289
that I just pale rusty dusty looking

265
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,449
chalk so first go strong with my morphe

266
00:08:28,289 --> 00:08:32,219
m5 13 brush and dipped into this warm

267
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:34,529
torn orange shade right here in the fake

268
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:38,039
palate and as I start off by décima in

269
00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:39,329
the crease oh that is not pigmented and

270
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,769
then using a clean version of the same

271
00:08:39,329 --> 00:08:42,419
brush I'm going to go to the same exact

272
00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:43,800
shade corresponding in the original

273
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:45,180
chocolate palette and do the same thing

274
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,920
already as you can see the original

275
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:48,839
palette has a lot more pigment and

276
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:51,180
payoff and is blending up very very

277
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:52,740
nicely next intagram IM poor 3/3 brushes

278
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:54,839
my all-time favorite fluffy brush for

279
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:57,839
creases and smokey eyes and there's a

280
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:59,819
gif light brown shade from the pink I'm

281
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,110
gonna pop this on the lid the shadow is

282
00:08:59,819 --> 00:09:02,579
definitely not letting out as well as

283
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:04,139
the first edited I honestly thought that

284
00:09:02,579 --> 00:09:05,910
I might be struck to the core and have a

285
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:08,279
better version in the end which I was a

286
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:10,019
little bit spooked about but this shadow

287
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:11,370
is nowhere near blending up very well as

288
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:13,259
you can see it's looking a super super

289
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:14,430
she and this like outer crease region

290
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:16,589
I'm gonna go ahead and grab some more

291
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:17,940
pigment onto the brush and really pack

292
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:20,610
it on there to try to create a more

293
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:22,470
uniform color but this is now looking as

294
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:23,790
free as I was expecting it to look well

295
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:25,620
I wasn't expecting it to look good but

296
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:29,220
then I was a little bit shocked and now

297
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:31,440
I'm unsure you get the point I'm gonna

298
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,910
grab my other M 4-3-3 brush and dip into

299
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,260
the same exact shade corresponding from

300
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:35,880
the real version of the chocolate

301
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,079
palette and put that on the other lid

302
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,120
next underground Miami

303
00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:41,160
5:07 brush and dip into this dark brown

304
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,959
shade in the bottom half of the palette

305
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:48,750
and use this too deep enough to smokey

306
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:50,459
eye for being fake shadows honestly

307
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:52,800
these have a ton of pigmentation and are

308
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:54,959
going on a super nicely but they're just

309
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,660
not blending out like in the slightest

310
00:09:54,959 --> 00:10:01,920
this literally looks the worst ever like

311
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:04,019
that is not how a smokey eye should be

312
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,029
blunt action okay so my camera decided I

313
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:08,220
didn't catch it in time but I just use

314
00:10:06,029 --> 00:10:09,689
my morphe m14 line pencil brush and

315
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,490
dipped it into this blue shade in both

316
00:10:09,689 --> 00:10:13,680
the fake version and the real version

317
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:15,420
and apply them and they are definitely

318
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,769
looking very very different the real

319
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,240
version is a lot more blue and a lot

320
00:10:16,769 --> 00:10:19,800
more pigmented whereas the fake person

321
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,660
is a lot more green tone and is nowhere

322
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,279
near as pigmented as the real version

323
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:25,680
there is no sparkle to this whatsoever

324
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:27,689
so definitely the real version is a lot

325
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,459
better maxilla gonna have an e at 19

326
00:10:27,689 --> 00:10:30,310
brush and dip into the brow bone

327
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:32,770
highlight

328
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:41,920
with just this right that's yellow and

329
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:44,080
the top corner Oh God oh no not did

330
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,790
absolutely nothing okay let's try that

331
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,260
again using the same exact brush the

332
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:53,890
clean version and dip into the real

333
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:55,600
problem shaking ah there we go

334
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:57,160
at least that definite looks a whole lot

335
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,860
better than that musty crusty dusty

336
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:02,230
yellow that literally looks like nothing

337
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:03,970
so that's good at least alright so those

338
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:05,500
are both smoky is all complete from the

339
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:06,820
fake palette I was honestly really

340
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:09,279
surprised to see that the shadows were

341
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:10,960
pretty pigmented but as you could see

342
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,700
they really do not blend out at all

343
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,320
there is so much passion is going on

344
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,700
especially out in this outer corner from

345
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,980
the dark brown shade that just did not

346
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:19,150
want to blend at all and this blue shade

347
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,950
on the lower lash line is nowhere near

348
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:21,970
as pigmented as the real version wears

349
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:23,140
on this side of the smokey eye is

350
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:25,240
definitely a lot more blown oh and

351
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:26,410
blended it is a more nutritional smokey

352
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,180
eye whereas on this side somehow it

353
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:31,270
became bright ass orange which I do not

354
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:32,529
want their arse a nice blue pop of color

355
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:34,630
on the lower lash line which actually

356
00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:36,280
shows up and the highlights are also

357
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:38,680
there as well and not looking talky and

358
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:40,240
invisible whereas on this side they're

359
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,010
gone the real version is obviously a lot

360
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,140
more expensive but you're paying for

361
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:45,310
quality pigmentation and blend ability

362
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:47,320
which this palette obviously does not

363
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:49,120
have so if you're gonna buy heading out

364
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,950
of the - same theme as everything else

365
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,480
so far oh this video by the real version

366
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:55,210
spend a little bit more money and get a

367
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,290
great house product moving on for the

368
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:59,500
Highlanders today we're gonna be using

369
00:11:56,290 --> 00:12:01,089
the iconic Kylie cosmetics watts at and

370
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,830
this is the real version and this is the

371
00:12:01,089 --> 00:12:04,150
fake version when you open them up the

372
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:05,440
pan sizes are obviously a whole lot

373
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:07,120
bigger and the real version than the

374
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,260
fake version and for the most part the

375
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,210
colors actually look pretty similar

376
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:11,770
except for the thought that

377
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:13,780
do-not-disturb was obviously a whole lot

378
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:15,850
more bright pink and the fake version

379
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:17,290
then in the real version to do a swatch

380
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:19,660
comparison I'm gonna grab a privacy

381
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:21,940
pleat on my pointer finger and then I'm

382
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:24,660
gonna grab it on my middle finger on the

383
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,660
other hand

384
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:31,189
whoa okay so privacy please from the

385
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:32,750
original Kelly Paula is ridiculously

386
00:12:31,189 --> 00:12:34,399
penguin said I've actually never tried

387
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:36,019
these calendars out before this promise

388
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,220
actually my baby Amanda and things still

389
00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:39,500
thank you to her for letting me borrow

390
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:41,269
it and then the privacy please from the

391
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:43,189
big Charlie Paula is a lot less

392
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:45,290
pigmented as you can see and definitely

393
00:12:43,189 --> 00:12:47,180
nowhere near as a metallic or reflected

394
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:48,949
as the original it is just kind of like

395
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,329
white satin finished kind of like more

396
00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:52,579
like an eyeshadow rather than an actual

397
00:12:50,329 --> 00:12:56,209
highlighter this is really really

398
00:12:52,579 --> 00:12:58,129
stunning oh that was really

399
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:59,300
underwhelming place oh there's literally

400
00:12:58,129 --> 00:13:01,579
just like no pigmentation in this

401
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,899
whatever this is after three different

402
00:13:01,579 --> 00:13:06,290
dips into the highlighter and as you can

403
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:07,850
see this claw is a little sad as you can

404
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:09,470
see for literally just one dip into the

405
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:11,720
original palette it is a whole lot more

406
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:13,160
pigmented a lot more blending the highly

407
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,509
is a lot more sparkly as well but I

408
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,959
honestly really really like how this

409
00:13:14,509 --> 00:13:18,939
looks

410
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:20,810
whereas on the fake side we get nothing

411
00:13:18,939 --> 00:13:22,040
obviously I can't believe put my nose in

412
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:23,240
half so I'm just gonna use the real

413
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:26,810
version on my nose so it doesn't look

414
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:30,860
the worst Papa oh well that is a

415
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:32,300
blinding highly oh my gosh whoa okay so

416
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:35,540
now that the blow is all complete I

417
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:36,800
guess kinda sorta our last steps it is

418
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:38,930
gonna be the lipid II doodahs and I

419
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,089
think I have the funniest comparison yet

420
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:45,470
and those are the k'kaw creme lipsticks

421
00:13:41,089 --> 00:13:52,009
from Kylie cosmetics and yeah this is

422
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:54,589
what we got oh my god oh wait the the

423
00:13:52,009 --> 00:13:56,329
colors the most nude light shade in the

424
00:13:54,589 --> 00:13:58,550
real version is literally like bright

425
00:13:56,329 --> 00:14:00,230
ass orange this looks like Anastacio

426
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:02,300
Ashton liquid lipstick in the fake

427
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:03,350
version was good and apply these and see

428
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:06,290
what they actually look like next to

429
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:09,410
each other oh it smells like paint it

430
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:12,439
literally smells like acrylic paint this

431
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:14,209
is probably so unsafe but I'm gonna go

432
00:14:12,439 --> 00:14:17,410
out and apply this shade camee to the

433
00:14:14,209 --> 00:14:17,410
fake side of my lips

434
00:14:21,289 --> 00:14:25,289
okay so the actual chemi smells like

435
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:26,609
nothing which is great I'm gonna go

436
00:14:25,289 --> 00:14:29,279
ahead and apply the real version on to

437
00:14:26,609 --> 00:14:30,629
the real half of my face you get the

438
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,249
point right now so I know that's like

439
00:14:30,629 --> 00:14:34,349
k'kaw cream liquid lipsticks are

440
00:14:32,249 --> 00:14:35,399
supposed to not dry down obviously the

441
00:14:34,349 --> 00:14:37,019
real version is still like a white

442
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:39,179
looking whereas the fake version have

443
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:40,469
dried down completely matte but even

444
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:42,269
just formula aside though if you're

445
00:14:40,469 --> 00:14:43,679
gonna disrespect a brand and all the

446
00:14:42,269 --> 00:14:46,559
hours and money that they put into a

447
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:49,189
product by copying them like can we at

448
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:52,799
least try to get the color like

449
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:54,779
relatively similar I mean like what is

450
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:56,099
that okay so normally my last step and

451
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:58,199
obviously beaches at my face in place

452
00:14:56,099 --> 00:14:59,159
but this just looks the worst ever so I

453
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:01,349
definitely do not want to keep this

454
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:04,049
makeup on for any longer and that is my

455
00:15:01,349 --> 00:15:06,569
full face of like us half face of fake

456
00:15:04,049 --> 00:15:07,709
makeup part two I'll complete I really

457
00:15:06,569 --> 00:15:08,939
really hope you guys know this video and

458
00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:10,589
definitely become a down below and tell

459
00:15:08,939 --> 00:15:12,299
me what side of the face you think looks

460
00:15:10,589 --> 00:15:13,589
better after testing out all these

461
00:15:12,299 --> 00:15:14,969
products I'm definitely gonna have to

462
00:15:13,589 --> 00:15:17,249
say that the real side of makeup

463
00:15:14,969 --> 00:15:18,839
definitely is my winner here a lot of

464
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:20,639
these fake makeup products cannot even

465
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:23,339
close to compare to the real versions

466
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,720
listen I know the low price tags can

467
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,889
sometimes be really really appealing to

468
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,449
you grant or on a budget

469
00:15:25,889 --> 00:15:30,509
trust me I get it makeup can sometimes

470
00:15:27,449 --> 00:15:32,039
be so so expensive but by putting all

471
00:15:30,509 --> 00:15:34,019
these fake products on today I am taking

472
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:35,609
a huge risk a lot of times these fake

473
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:36,929
products are nowhere near the same

474
00:15:35,609 --> 00:15:38,639
chemical composition as the real

475
00:15:36,929 --> 00:15:40,470
versions they can sometimes contain a

476
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,909
really really harmful and bad chemicals

477
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:43,139
to your essence put on your face then

478
00:15:41,909 --> 00:15:44,819
you're not just inhale and like your

479
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:46,229
lips or your eyes so if you can

480
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:47,609
definitely some of the action money's to

481
00:15:46,229 --> 00:15:49,739
get the real versions I mean it's gonna

482
00:15:47,609 --> 00:15:51,659
pay off in a frontal on peg rotational

483
00:15:49,739 --> 00:15:54,139
makeup in general so I definitely not

484
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:56,099
recommend any of these products at all

485
00:15:54,139 --> 00:15:57,389
alright sisters if you guys enjoyed

486
00:15:56,099 --> 00:15:59,099

488
00:15:59,099 --> 00:16:02,399
definitely would like to turn this

489
00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:02,759
testing fake makeup videos into like a

490
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,139
full-on

491
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:05,729
series where I go to Santee alley and

492
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:07,439
just get fake products all the time I

493
00:16:05,729 --> 00:16:08,999
mean these guys are really freaking

494
00:16:07,439 --> 00:16:10,049
quick anytime that there's a new release

495
00:16:08,999 --> 00:16:11,489

496
00:16:10,049 --> 00:16:12,569
instantaneously so I would love to keep

up with that and show you guys the

498
00:16:12,569 --> 00:16:15,689
comparisons between the real and the

499
00:16:14,219 --> 00:16:17,669
fake because I think it is very very

500
00:16:15,689 --> 00:16:19,409
interesting to learn as a consumer and

501
00:16:17,669 --> 00:16:20,999
