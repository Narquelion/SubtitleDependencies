17
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,590
feel like there's been a tutorial for

18
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:52,589
every different Halloween look at least

19
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:54,750

00:00:52,589 --> 00:00:56,399
was feeling lazy today I know you how to

21
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,690

00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,949

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,970
before but it is still one of the most

29
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:13,740
requested looks every single season and

30
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:15,600
apparently I've actually never done them

31
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,100
before according to my Instagram makeup

32
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,939
and YouTube history which is actually

33
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,770
it's so crazy

34
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:21,240

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,180
beautiful eye look planned I have some

39
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,380
special effects planned and we're just

40
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,430
gonna look like I just crawled out of

41
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,930
the depths of the sea

42
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:33,680
ready to slay Halloween season 10

43
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:36,819
without further ado let's get started

44
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,819
[Music]

45
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:42,060
hi sisters at James house here and

46
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,320
welcome back to my DIY okay so before we

47
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,450
actually get to the makeup application

48
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,400
portion of this mermaid on the face I do

49
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:48,870
have like any kind of scale I do that I

50
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,430
want to do on the neck inspired by

51
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:52,020
Channing Judith you guys may remember

52
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,369
that name that is our see the artist

53
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,960
that did my amazing transformation for

54
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:56,280
my beauty con series she is so

55
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,590
incredibly talented and that is actually

56
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,970
how I found her or that series was the

57
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,770
picture that she posted on Twitter of

58
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:03,180
mermaids killed on somebody's leg that

59
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,710
she did with special effects and I want

60
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,780
to do my best to recreate the same exact

61
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:08,070
thing on my night today but on a budget

62
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,720
and make it really really easy for you

63
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:11,880
guys all we're going to need is two

64
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,980
things a hot glue gun I got this other

65
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,390
Castro for a whopping 11 dollars glue

66
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,709
stick got these for three dollars now

67
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:19,800
these are fun glue sticks because

68
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:21,270
they're glittery can you see that great

69
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,320
I thought these would be really easy for

70
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,820
the marina boat since I have green

71
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,220
sparkle in them and we're gonna add a

72
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:28,110
green sparkle on top anyway so saving

73
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:30,209
ourselves some time if you're under the

74
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:32,370
age of 13 don't do this unless you have

75
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:33,690
a parents help I don't want to get sued

76
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:35,550
for one of you burning yourselves with a

77
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:37,530
clue so this has been a PS I thank you

78
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:39,600
for coming to my talk I can't find

79
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:41,760
parchment paper most because I forgot to

80
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,380
buy it so what we're gonna do is take

81
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,209
this classic green sheet and hope that I

82
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:47,160
don't burn it and stick at the glue

83
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:48,810
stick in the glue gun

84
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,390
basically what I'm gonna do is take the

85
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:54,480
glue stack and take this sheet and I'm

86
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:57,600
going to just squeeze it real good and

87
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,880
just put a dollop of glue on there and

88
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,310
kind of the shape of a mermaid scale

89
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,690
kind of just like that and I'm gonna

90
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:06,090
give the gun a good twirl to get that

91
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:07,500
straight off and then sit there first

92
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:09,360
like that because in case you didn't

93
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,890
know hot glue is very hot once again

94
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,150
thank you this is what a fuse bag so

95
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:14,190
once this is how to second to cool down

96
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:16,500
I'm gonna take my clean finger and I'm

97
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:19,049
going to lately press on the glue and

98
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,150
flatten out a little bit right before it

99
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:23,519
fully hardens and you'll notice that the

100
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:24,810
glue is slightly moldable so you can

101
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,610
kind of form it into the shape of a

102
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:29,160
scale to say thoughts kind of like round

103
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:33,790
and flat like that is literally it so

104
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:36,700
we're just gonna make like a lot of them

105
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:39,380
[Music]

106
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:40,490
so once you have like a lot done final

107
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:44,380
here to do is describe a pair of it

108
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:47,729
really sharp tweezers I'm gonna use this

109
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:47,729
[Music]

110
00:03:48,100 --> 00:04:03,830
oh this is not playing well

111
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:18,560
oh my god the next thing this dope turns

112
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:19,370
out my face is gonna burn down am I

113
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:24,890
crazy

114
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:26,090
you saw that oh it's right here oh no so

115
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,320
as always I always like to start off my

116
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:28,850
foundation at first I'm gonna grab my

117
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,230
Too Faced Born This Way Foundation if

118
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:31,850
this photos in the shade natural beige

119
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:33,860
and I'm gonna tell you right now the

120
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:36,440
shade is far Tanner than I am we're

121
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:37,850
going for a mermaid look okay we're

122
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,980
gonna be tan and I'm also gonna grab a

123
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:41,360
little bit of the Mac strobe cream and

124
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,800
gold light as well

125
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,150
I know desi Perkins actually just

126
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,400
uploaded a mermaid tutorial and her look

127
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,750
was so incredibly beautiful and inspired

128
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,430
me to do a little bit more of a glowy

129
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,990
look for today just gonna grab my beauty

130
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:53,090
sponge and mix that together on the back

131
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:55,990
of my hand and then just plop it right

132
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:55,990
on there and blend it

133
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,410
and then with the access foundation on

134
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:02,509
the back of my hand I'm just gonna take

135
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:05,449
an m4 3:9 and I'm going to really dip

136
00:05:02,509 --> 00:05:06,800
into that and blend down my neck one to

137
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:08,180
avoid getting a million comments saying

138
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,669
that my foundation doesn't match because

139
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:12,080
I know and two because you guys just saw

140
00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:13,490
me making those skills earlier and those

141
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,080
are going to be going on my neck later

142
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:16,310
on in the video so I definitely need

143
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,960
everything to blend together seamlessly

144
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:19,669
next I'm just gonna grab a concealer

145
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,259
this is the Attar shave tape as always

146
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:24,050
and apply this to the high points of my

147
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:25,729
face to cover up my under eye bags and

148
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:26,990
also just to add some more dimension

149
00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:29,120
just because I really like how the

150
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:30,110
attention goes right down to the center

151
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:35,449
and just really makes everything look

152
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:36,740
super pretty from products that I'm

153
00:05:35,449 --> 00:05:38,300
actually gonna use two different ones

154
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:39,650
the first one begin the regular Laura

155
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,599
Mercier translucent setting powder this

156
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:44,180
is so my all-time favorites and also the

157
00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:45,320
brand-new Laura Mercier glow translucent

158
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:47,000
powder I haven't really tried this

159
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,410
without yet but I do all my stay to be

160
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,270
very very dewy today so first

161
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:51,949
impressions time I'm gonna dip my Beauty

162
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:53,840
Blender into the regular powder and use

163
00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:55,039
this to set right underneath my eyeballs

164
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,750
just because I really need to set this

165
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,970
in place and also just right on top of

166
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:01,070
the Dinos bridge as well in the center

167
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:02,840
of the forehead just to get those

168
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:04,820
creases gone to contour today I was

169
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,530
gonna go buy a before Oh fire brush usko

170
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:08,840
J's for 10% off and dip into my

171
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:10,909
anastacio contouring a kit and just dip

172
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,740
into this middle cool tone shade right

173
00:06:10,909 --> 00:06:14,300
open here I do already normally tend to

174
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,199
go a little bit harsh with the contour

175
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,430
just because I really like the way my

176
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,849
face looks when it's really tough

177
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,080
loadout

178
00:06:16,849 --> 00:06:19,430
but for today I do actually want to go

179
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,260
even a little bit harsher than normal

180
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:25,010
especially with the bronzer because this

181
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:29,060
is obviously a mermaid sunkissed kind of

182
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:30,500
type of look and the next undergo am

183
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:32,750
about five to seven brushes is just a

184
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,550
beefy big a bronzer brush and dip into

185
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:36,050
this kind of more a caramel shade or

186
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:37,220
right next door to that one and I'm

187
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:39,289
gonna use this to blend together my

188
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:40,190
contour and normal skin tones I'm gonna

189
00:06:39,289 --> 00:06:41,389
save the blush and highlight for a

190
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:43,490
little bit later on I'm mostly because

191
00:06:41,389 --> 00:06:44,720
I'm not exactly sure what combination

192
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:47,389
I'm gonna be feeling when it comes to

193
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,419
the eye look so for right now what I am

194
00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:51,590
going to do is it for once not baked

195
00:06:50,419 --> 00:06:53,060
because I definitely don't want to look

196
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:55,130
at any more powder than I are do I

197
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:57,620
really want that dewy look so I'm going

198
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:58,909
to grab my mac fix+ of gold light as you

199
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:01,400
can see this bottle has definitely had

200
00:06:58,909 --> 00:07:02,620
quite the usage this is like one of my

201
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,780
favorite makeup products

202
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:06,310
early in the entire world it is just so

203
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07,630
pretty and it is just like fix+ butter

204
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:09,460
does have a slight glitter in it that

205
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:12,930
just reflects so nicely on the skin I'm

206
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:12,930
gonna get myself a quick sister spreads

207
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:19,630
I'm gonna do a rose quickly using the

208
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:22,120
Anasazi eyebrow was in the shade and

209
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:23,500
medium brown air pencil all time and I'm

210
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,300
gonna do these a little bit more like

211
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,440
fluffy and a wispy than normal I

212
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,720
definitely don't want them to be like

213
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,620
normal James Charles Instagram brow I

214
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,590
want a little bit more of like a

215
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:33,070
underwater wet moment does that make

216
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,960
sense

217
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:36,640
you'll see okay sorry line I literally

218
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,980
filled them in exactly and like I'd

219
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:41,170
normally do but and then it's gonna grab

220
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:43,420
the anasazi clear gel after that and I'm

221
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:45,190
going to go right through and kind of

222
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:46,450
brush those hairs upwards to kind of get

223
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:47,380
rid of a little bit of that brow pencil

224
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:49,330
to really make them a little bit more

225
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:52,720
light and fluffy and just to make them

226
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:54,370
look spiky by Seljuk at brow hello I

227
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,260
kind of like low-key don't even want to

228
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:57,880
conceal under Neath my eyebrows but I

229
00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:00,160
also feel like I need to it's cleaner

230
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,840
really really lightly go right

231
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,150
underneath that brow not even really to

232
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,710
clean it up just to literally cover over

233
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,810
the foundations I'm just gonna pull that

234
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:10,150
concealer right down onto the eyelid to

235
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:11,380
prime for eyeshadow so that is the face

236
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:12,940
all done and now I get to move on to my

237
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:14,560
all-time favorite part always which is

238
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:16,090
going to be the eyes and for its today's

239
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,530
like I actually have a really fun look

240
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:19,660
picked out from an artist that I fall on

241
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:22,060
Instagram her name is Gabrielle with two

242
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:25,030
axes and is this like neon green to dark

243
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:26,740
blue kind of cut crease with the glitter

244
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:28,930
liner look that she has going on it is

245
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:30,100
so crazy so intense but it's like it's

246
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:31,330
going to look absolutely perfect with

247
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,220
this mermaid lips today and we're gonna

248
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:34,570
attempt hopefully hate to make this look

249
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:36,520
good so I'm first gonna start off with

250
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:38,470
any fluffy brush this is the Emma 5:13

251
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:40,570
and just dip into a neon bright green

252
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:42,940
shade and I'm gonna pop this right in at

253
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:44,530
the inner corner right here just

254
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,460
starting by topping it in so it's super

255
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:46,840
super pigmented

256
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:48,400
and then I'm just going to lightly blend

257
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:50,080
out those edges to make sure those edges

258
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,970
have blended out on an m4 33 I'm just

259
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,530
gonna dip into a bright yellow shade and

260
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:55,300
a tiny bit of that green as well and

261
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:57,730
just go right over the edge

262
00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:00,340
that's too yellow I'm just kidding going

263
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:02,440
back into the green on another I'm 433

264
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:04,810
I'm gonna dupe into a light teal shade

265
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,580
and place that right next door

266
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:08,320
focusing this color right above my

267
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:10,000
natural crease with any excess I'm just

268
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,500
going to lightly blend this up going

269
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,030
back into that green take sure we didn't

270
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,710
lose any of it with the same exact brush

271
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:16,480
on the teal I'm going to dip into more

272
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:19,600
of that tail shade and I'm going to use

273
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,770
this color to form that outer V starting

274
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,030
off by just kind of stamping that shade

275
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:23,590
on there and then of course going in

276
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:24,700
after to blend it out and my outer

277
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:26,410
corner I'm just gonna take a little bit

278
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,510
more of a fluffy packing brush and dip

279
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:30,760
into a darker blue I don't know places

280
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:31,930
right in the outer V and just pack it on

281
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,790
there and I'm just putting that shade

282
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:36,160
right up into the crease

283
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:37,630
okay sorry hello I am back the camera

284
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,190
just accidentally stopped recording it

285
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:41,170
has only been over a year since I filmed

286
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:42,760
this tutorial so sorry about that

287
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:43,870
once this shadow was all planned out the

288
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,340
way I liked it I'm just gonna go ahead

289
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:46,990
and cut my crease using a a small

290
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:48,730
concealer brush and some shave tape on

291
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:52,270
the back of my hand this is gonna have

292
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:54,040
so far I'm gonna grab a small pocket

293
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:56,050
brushes the a matte one to four and just

294
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:58,120
pack on a light teal shade I mean like

295
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:59,740
Hello right on the inner corner just

296
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,720
packing the shade on there right on top

297
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:03,370
of the concealer being super careful not

298
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,720
to get it over the line it's okay if the

299
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:06,100
shade doesn't purposely touch that cut

300
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,200
crease as well because they had to be

301
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:10,030
using a liquid liner in a few short

302
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,990
minutes just to line out the crease and

303
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:12,520
then without saving that brush I'm just

304
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:16,210
gonna dip into more of a that metallic

305
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:17,080
like aqua shade literally oops I had

306
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:18,820
literally don't know how to do tutorials

307
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:21,100
and I'm just gonna place that right or

308
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:23,680
that kind of line between it the light

309
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:25,270
teal and dark blue just to blend them

310
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,560
together I'm just kind of patting it on

311
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:28,630
there and then using a slight like

312
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,280
back-and-forth rubbing motion to blend

313
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:31,780
at the same time so for the inner corner

314
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:34,120
little liner I actually don't have like

315
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:37,420
a sky blue liquid liner so what I am

316
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:39,399
going to do is use this white liner from

317
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:40,540
I don't even know what Brendan says my

318
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:42,220
friend hey-zeus gave me this one but

319
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:44,769
this brand it's just a really good white

320
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:47,019
liner mixed with literally the tiniest

321
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:52,779
bit of the ofra liquid lipstick in the

322
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:55,269
shade on my beach now I think I'm going

323
00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:57,910
to use the yellow liner I'm going to

324
00:10:55,269 --> 00:11:00,579
follow that line and wing it out just

325
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:01,689
like that oh my god pretty okay and then

326
00:11:00,579 --> 00:11:03,369
once that later is dry I'm just gonna

327
00:11:01,689 --> 00:11:05,079
grab the Urban Decay glitter liner in

328
00:11:03,369 --> 00:11:07,329
the shade a Midnight Cowboy and go right

329
00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:08,499
over top of that yellow so I think for

330
00:11:07,329 --> 00:11:11,079
the liner I'm once again gonna grab a

331
00:11:08,499 --> 00:11:14,319
little bit more concealer on the back of

332
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:16,299
my hand and yet another tiny brush this

333
00:11:14,319 --> 00:11:18,730
one is the morphe at 19 and I'm going to

334
00:11:16,299 --> 00:11:21,220
cut the lid kind of like again I guess

335
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:22,449
but like only in the liner area using a

336
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:24,189
really tiny pocket brush I'm just gonna

337
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:26,949
tap on that metallic teal shade from

338
00:11:24,189 --> 00:11:27,850
before right onto that concealer carving

339
00:11:26,949 --> 00:11:30,399
a little bit of the peaches and cream

340
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:31,809
and glitter makeup base on the e30 7

341
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,879
brushes just a tiny little brush and

342
00:11:31,809 --> 00:11:36,309
just packing that right on top of the

343
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:38,319
liner Ivor's gonna pack on a gold

344
00:11:36,309 --> 00:11:39,519
pigment right on the inner corner then

345
00:11:38,319 --> 00:11:40,899
just placing got some chunkier glitter

346
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,579
that I found at the craft store right in

347
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:44,980
the center just gonna go the Urban Decay

348
00:11:42,579 --> 00:11:47,230
Midnight Cowboy liner one last high and

349
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:48,549
pop it over top of that inner corner so

350
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:50,379
that is the upper eyelid all complete

351
00:11:48,549 --> 00:11:50,919
and I'm actually really happy how that

352
00:11:50,379 --> 00:11:52,239
turned out

353
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:54,009
didn't really have too much confidence

354
00:11:52,239 --> 00:11:56,230
myself not gonna lie but kind of looking

355
00:11:54,009 --> 00:11:57,910
good and fresh so I'm gonna finish out

356
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:59,679
the eye now using the amp or three three

357
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:02,290
and first dip into that same aqua shade

358
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:03,669
from before and start placing this on at

359
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:05,350
the lower lash line making sure to

360
00:12:03,669 --> 00:12:07,089
connect to in from that outer V region

361
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:09,249
and then go in the deep blue shade on em

362
00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:11,619
506 and just tucking that right up into

363
00:12:09,249 --> 00:12:17,679
the outer corner and pumping it up into

364
00:12:11,619 --> 00:12:18,910
the lash line as well any time use a

365
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:20,619
little bit of green or right in that

366
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:22,239
inner corner I'm gonna use the Tarte

367
00:12:20,619 --> 00:12:23,379
press payment in the shade at top yacht

368
00:12:22,239 --> 00:12:24,879
to highlight my brow bone and inner

369
00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:26,379
corner to finish off the light in my

370
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:28,389
waterline I'm gonna put the Tarte

371
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:29,889
claypot in the shade of blue moon right

372
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:31,839
up in there and then four locks I'm

373
00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:33,459
gonna pop on a pair of Yas Queen from

374
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,049
Lily lashes these are brand new and they

375
00:12:33,459 --> 00:12:35,440
are literally Miami's except one time as

376
00:12:35,049 --> 00:12:37,660
long as

377
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,970
the other this is everything that I've

378
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:41,650
ever needed in a lodge all right sisters

379
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:43,180
and that is one I of this mermaid look

380
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:44,410
all complete I'm gonna go in and if they

381
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,610
want off camera quickly they save some

382
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:48,460
time because that literally just took me

383
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:50,680
an hour half I'll be right back to

384
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:52,990
finish out the rest of this hug we're

385
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:56,200
back it's been another hour but I am

386
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:58,570
still going strong kind of those Lea's

387
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,910
all complete and low-key like hello I

388
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:02,560
snap like this looks so pretty I

389
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:03,820
absolutely I'm obsessed of how this

390
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,320
turned out thank you so much to

391
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:07,330
Gabrielle for the inspiration at today

392
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:09,580
but let's move on to it the rest of the

393
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:10,690
face to finish up this mermaid look so

394
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,890
to put on my blush and highlight and

395
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:13,450
like everything else today I wanted to

396
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:15,130
grab a pair of a fishnet tights because

397
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:18,430
that creates a whole like scale effect

398
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:20,200
and I forgot to buy them so instead I

399
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:22,330
have to use my very very expensive at

400
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:25,030
Swarovski crystal tights that I wore to

401
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:28,500
Drakon I'm very annoyed about this and

402
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:37,840
I'm going to try not to ruin them a

403
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:45,640
little bit on us that literally barely

404
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:50,230
did anything you're kidding you can see

405
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:51,550
it but like that is not okay so this

406
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:52,840
gift obviously did not work but it's

407
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:55,900
okay because we're gonna have scales on

408
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:57,370
our neck later on light hopin it spot I

409
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:59,500
do want to add something to my face so I

410
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:05,530
picked out these half little pearls that

411
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:08,760
I want to stick on kind of fun oh my god

412
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:08,760
doing things those nails are so hard

413
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:23,630
I put one right up in here and one right

414
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:25,550
on that one too okay so that is pretty

415
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:27,529
much the face all complete I think I'm

416
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:28,490
going to add on the Anasazi Beverly

417
00:14:27,529 --> 00:14:30,980
Hills liquid lipstick in the shade

418
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:32,420
insomniac as a base and I'm gonna pop on

419
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,920
a little bit of the Mac reflex in the

420
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:40,430
shaded teal right on the center all

421
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:41,660
right you guys see that it already

422
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:42,740
sensors I'm just gonna finish this off

423
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,730
once again with a little bit of the

424
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:46,370
mac's fix+

425
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:48,380
gold setting spray and that is pretty

426
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:50,210
much this look all complete so you could

427
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:51,920
totally stop here throw in a wig some

428
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:54,410
seashells a cute little bra and a

429
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,670
mermaid tail and call it today but this

430
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:56,960
is the James Charles youtube channel and

431
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:59,270
you guys don't really take it a step

432
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:01,220
further so I want to add some special

433
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:02,960
effects to the mix I'm first gonna start

434
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:04,490
by over my makeup forever flash palette

435
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:07,190
you can use this or like literally any

436
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:08,839
face paint it does not matter okay

437
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:10,250
totally what I'm actually gonna start by

438
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:11,960
doing is scraping my liquid latex from

439
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:13,430
Ben Nye and a roll of toilet paper now

440
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,740
special effects is very very complicated

441
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:17,210
but I'm a beginner and I do definitely

442
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,589
want to learn more there may or may not

443
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:20,780
be a video on that coming very very soon

444
00:15:18,589 --> 00:15:22,339
but for now this is all you're gonna

445
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:23,870
need I'm gonna pour a little bit of it

446
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:26,660
out into this little hole in my lash

447
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:28,130
thing just for easy access and then just

448
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:30,110
using a disposable cross buns I'm just

449
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:32,300
going to start by applying this to my

450
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:34,940
neck I'm gonna focus in on little areas

451
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,570
at a time as well because it does dry it

452
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:37,190
pretty quickly

453
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:38,810
so literally that's all I need then I'm

454
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:40,790
gonna grab just a sheet of toilet paper

455
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:42,710
I'm going to shred it up into little

456
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:44,120
pieces and I'm gonna lay it right on the

457
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:45,530
skin and then once I does on that I'm

458
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,510
just gonna go back in with a little bit

459
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:48,950
more on the brush basically what we're

460
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:51,230
doing here is creating like a second

461
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:53,360
layer of skin over top of the area that

462
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:55,010
I want to have the scales on so once the

463
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,589
latex is completely dry I can actually

464
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:59,720
peel up a hole in the middle and it'll

465
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:00,709
look like my skin is like ripping there

466
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,570
are a lot of different ways you can

467
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:03,980
actually achieve this look as well I

468
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:04,459
think Channing and her original photo

469
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,560
used

470
00:16:04,459 --> 00:16:08,420
scar wax which I do have it right here

471
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,459
you can like mold this kind of like clay

472
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:11,779
on the skin but it's definitely a lot

473
00:16:10,459 --> 00:16:13,230
more work and it's for people who really

474
00:16:11,779 --> 00:16:16,130
know what they're doing and

475
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:16,130
That's not me

476
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:20,670
well unsexy she's all on there I'm just

477
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:22,410
gonna take another bag a glob of liquid

478
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:24,630
latex on the spine and I'm just gonna go

479
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:26,640
lightly over the entire surface just

480
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:27,900
kind of brush it to make it smooth and

481
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:30,000
then with that access product I'm just

482
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:31,560
gonna go around and really really

483
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,200
lightly and kind of feather the look of

484
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:36,000
latex now on the edges obviously it is

485
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,830
going to try obviously we're gonna put

486
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,780
foundation over it to fix the color but

487
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:41,490
we want the actual formula and the

488
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:42,360
texture to blend with the skin as much

489
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:43,500
as possible

490
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,330
I'm just gonna let this dry down for a

491
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,470
few minutes I'll be right back what does

492
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:47,910
pretty much fine I'm just gonna grab a

493
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:49,770
fluffy brush and some translucent powder

494
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:51,360
and just tap that right on the surface

495
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:53,760
just to make sure everything is in place

496
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,900
and nothing is still wet by accident

497
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,820
and if you're doing this at home as well

498
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:58,710
your neck should feel really really

499
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,850
tight right now that's okay it's a good

500
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:01,320
thing then I'm just gonna grab once

501
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:03,540
again at my Too Faced Born This Way

502
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,130
Foundation and my own for 3:9 and I'm

503
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,900
just going to stipple that and then just

504
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:08,100
going to powder that once again okay so

505
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,320
now comes the fun part where this stops

506
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:12,420
looking like a gross scary rash and

507
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,440
starts looking like mermaid scales so

508
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:15,150
I'm just gonna grab my tiny little

509
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:17,460
scissors that I use with my lashes now

510
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:19,080
be careful during this time please do

511
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:21,240
not cut yourself but I'm just going to

512
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:23,550
lightly go in and start picking at the

513
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:28,800
center of the latex now once you're in

514
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:30,360
you should be able to start cutting so

515
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,130
crazy okay and you're basically just

516
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:37,410
gonna cut out a big hole right around

517
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:39,390
this entire area and then once you have

518
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:41,700
that oval I'm just gonna cut little slit

519
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:44,360
into the edges to kind of like ruffle

520
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,360
them off a little bit

521
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,460
you

522
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,820
kind of lightly tug on it as well now

523
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,929
I'm going to grab my m2 g4 brush and my

524
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,690
make up forever flash palette and I'm

525
00:17:51,929 --> 00:17:56,520
gonna dip into the teal blue and green

526
00:17:54,690 --> 00:18:00,679
shades and it's kind of mixed them all

527
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:00,679
together and plopped them right in there

528
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,450
then it's gonna grab a little bit of

529
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,770
block kind of a lot a bit of block

530
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:09,360
honestly I don't it's going to use this

531
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:11,100
and shove it right in the outer edges

532
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,790
just to create some more dimension and

533
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:15,530
to make it look like it's an actual hole

534
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:17,789
[Music]

535
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:19,169
so finally now we get to all the hot

536
00:18:17,789 --> 00:18:21,299
glue scales we literally spent two hours

537
00:18:19,169 --> 00:18:23,580
making today half of which are now

538
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:25,260
missing inside of my stove can't wait to

539
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:27,120
burn my house down to apply this I'm

540
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:28,289
just gonna grab some Kryolan at Spiricom

541
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,419
as you can see mine has clearly been

542
00:18:28,289 --> 00:18:32,130
through quite a lot at this point still

543
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:34,470
works just as well basically this is

544
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:37,020
just kind of like insanely strong glue

545
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:38,370
and all you do is put it right on the

546
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,990
area it's gonna wait for it to dry a

547
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:42,260
little bit and then stick on some sister

548
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:42,260
scales

549
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:54,960
[Music]

550
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,960
you

551
00:18:56,530 --> 00:19:08,720
you guys about liquid latex on them like

552
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:10,580
without do anything once that is all dry

553
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,870
and set in place thank God

554
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:14,000
I guess the answer is to use liquid

555
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:16,250
latex and not Spiricom we're learning

556
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,780
together now I went to gravel once again

557
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,100
that same little brush and just too big

558
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:20,330
into the makeup Rover flash palette I'm

559
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,590
just going to grab a mixture of those

560
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:23,570
colors and we're going to stipple them

561
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:25,460
over top of the skills just to bring

562
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:27,590
some of that color back since the tan is

563
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:29,330
clearly not what we're looking for a

564
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:34,490
little bit of reflex teal right up in

565
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:37,150
there I should put some little glitters

566
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:39,380
in there too just for funsies Oh Katie

567
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:41,930
already sisters and that is this under

568
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:43,490
the sea a mermaid look all complete yeah

569
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:45,050
I did for this look came very very last

570
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:46,790
second and I have not done a tutorial in

571
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:48,440
a very very long time I definitely

572
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:50,660
apologize if the city was a little bit

573
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:52,130
of a mess but then again so is every

574
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:54,950
single James Charles video and in the

575
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:56,870

576
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:58,910

today that's what the Ark so special

582
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:09,020
effects not the best but I still think

583
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,310
it gets the point across I definitely

584
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:12,770
need more practice I literally have not

585
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:13,310
done it in over a year now but can

586
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:14,870
always get better

587
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,980
