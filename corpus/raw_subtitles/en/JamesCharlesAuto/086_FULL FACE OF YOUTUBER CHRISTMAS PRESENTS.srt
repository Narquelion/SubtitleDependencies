5
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:10,440
this year apparently Santa has decided

6
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,240
to bring me a sty I have not been able

7
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,370
to put on makeup for six days now which

8
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,570
has been so incredibly inconvenient if

9
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,890
you've been following me on snapchat you

10
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,180
know that literally a few days ago it

11
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:20,160
was so swollen that I could barely even

12
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,960
open it so now we have definitely made

13
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,340
improvements please do not leave any

14
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,779
comments I am well aware of the fact

15
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,740
that I look like I am looking in two

16
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:27,660
different directions

17
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,580
we're just gonna roll with it I have to

18
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,170
get this video done for today's video

19
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,579

20
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,719
plan that I am very excited to do in

21
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:35,610
honor of the holiday season

22
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:38,040

23
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:40,559
see your family at time for friends love

24
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,149

25
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,440
season of giving I personally love

26
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:44,789
giving gifts to all my friends and

27
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,899
family it is so much fun for me to be

28
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:47,100
able to think of really really cute

29
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:49,079
things just to give back to the people

30
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,070
that mean the most to me and this is

31
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:51,510

32
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,399

Christmas I'm gonna be here in LA all

34
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:57,989
alone so in order to compensate for that

35
00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:00,149
I force all my close friends to give me

36
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:01,829

00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,140
routine and they all picked out a

43
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,280

sample size I don't usually use like

69
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,550
primers that you put on with your hands

70
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,289

71
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,979

I feel like I don't have as much

74
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:17,430
experience with primers as you probably

75
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:20,430
do but I do like this one and it smells

76
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:21,450
nice when it goes on your face anyway I

77
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,489

thank you sister Sofia so now that our

81
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,330
piece is all primed ready to go our next

82
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,310
up is going to be a foundation and for

83
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:35,790
this I assigned it the queen of skin

84
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:38,069
talk to us Brock hey sister James so by

85
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:41,610
now I'm sure you have looked in the bag

86
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:44,459
this is the lemare soft fluid liquid

87
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:46,500
foundation that is expensive but it is a

88
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:48,299
miracle product and I'm curious what

89
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,060
your thoughts are on it you already have

90
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:53,610
pretty awesome skin but I think that it

91
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,680
is time for you to branch out and try

92
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:58,500
new things that are not your makeup

93
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,069
forever stick foundation oh okay I hope

94
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,900
you love it

95
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:03,200
I'm curious to see how your luck turns

96
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:06,989
out and I love you lots

97
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,790
Oh so mama Westbrook wanted to come for

98
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:10,680
me today I see how it's gonna be shot

99
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:13,170
see let's go ahead a plan is talk to you

100
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,900
got me shade number ivory Oh - so

101
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:18,209
hopefully it is a good match for my skin

102
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,319
it's a good match you guys know I'm

103
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:21,299
definitely a very very full coverage

104
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:22,889
type of Queen even when I'm doing a more

105
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:24,750
natural look I'll still use a light

106
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:26,069
foundation and just sheer out I would

107
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,690
normally never reach for a foundation

108
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:29,519
dish share but I actually feel like it

109
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:30,750
layered beautifully on the skin so I'm

110
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,730
very excited to keep using this and

111
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:34,260
trying it out thanks sister Tati

112
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,910
so our next step is gonna be to hide our

113
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,319
under-eye bags and make our face nice

114
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:39,090
and bright like the star top of the

115
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:40,590
Christmas tree and for this we're gonna

116
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:43,319
be using concealer which is sent to me

117
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:47,519

118
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:49,079
sister Nicole so my gift to you is tart

119
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,200
shape tape because I really feel like

120
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:54,769
that was such a staple product of 2017

121
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:57,630
it was everybody's favorite and I know

122
00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:59,700

123
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:02,760

126
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:07,530

127
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:09,030

128
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,950

right places son sister toffee sent us a

130
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,950
very very light coverage foundation

131
00:04:12,359 --> 00:04:15,599
today obviously you guys know shape tape

132
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:16,500
it's a very very full coverage so I feel

133
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,329
like these two will balance each other

134
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,979
out really nicely to create a beautiful

135
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:21,510
base okay so now that the foundation

136
00:04:19,979 --> 00:04:22,150
that conceals are all in place obviously

137
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,979

143
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:36,340

00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:41,800

162
00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:13,690
favorite youtubers Rob Beauty by

163
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,760
Christie she sent me this pocket right

164
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:18,370
over here let's see what she got us hey

165
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,770
sisters today James asked me to pick a

166
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:22,060
contour product and I was like what

167
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:22,750
product should I pick and I thought

168
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,639
initially

169
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:26,500
Kat Von D shade + light I know I love

170
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:30,010
that one and I know James does too but

171
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:31,960
then I thought what would James do and I

172
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:34,720
think he would use code James for 10%

173
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:37,479
off so today I decided to go with the

174
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,729
morphe 9 C palette so have fun

175
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:44,080
contouring and don't forget to use code

176
00:05:39,729 --> 00:05:45,700
James like you ever could oh she is the

177
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,349
cutest ever and also this pocketing is

178
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,889

00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:03,669
off this holiday season even though our

186
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:05,800
faces all chiseled out we are missing

187
00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:07,539
one thing and that is blush when I think

188
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,680
of beautiful skin and just happiness and

189
00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:12,300
beautiful rosy cheeks

190
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,300
I think of Alyssa Ashley

191
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:20,920
[Music]

192
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:22,780

196
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:32,560
more of Patrick's powder and I'm going

197
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:34,510
to bake my face so while our base is

198
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,950
baking in place at 350 degrees and we

199
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:38,350
are making some beautiful Christmas

200
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:40,060
cookies we're gonna move on to the

201
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:42,010
eyebrows normally I would say eyebrows

202
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:43,630
are supposed to be sisters and not twins

203
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:46,030
but obviously you want them to be as

204
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:47,440
close as we possibly can get so to start

205
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:49,390
my brows in place today I asked my

206
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,730

holidays I was able to send you an expo

00:06:56,290 --> 00:07:00,520
marker for your eyebrows because I feel

211
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:01,900
like this is a very underrated product

212
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,280
in the makeup world and it's gonna get

213
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:05,890

224
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:38,850
this work

225
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:43,920
[Music]

226
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:43,920

231
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:54,820
say so myself

232
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,410
thanks a big wrecking to Vaughn to the

233
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,490
eyeshadow you guys don't I started

234
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:58,930
updating makeup I was in it for the

235
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:00,460
really really colorful beautiful

236
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:01,900
creative looks and when I think of

237
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,910
eyeshadow and really really beautiful

238
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,660
vibrant colors I first think of a sister

239
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:07,390
Jackie ina

240
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:09,640
hi James it's a girl Jackie O what it's

241
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:11,650
so do I really have to explain why I

242
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:14,020
chose a Pat McGrath eyeshadow palette

243
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:16,330
come on come on is fab grad like come on

244
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:17,680
seriously you Billy you Billy Pat

245
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,910
McGrath is not only one of my favorite

246
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,920
makeup artists but I really kind of feel

247
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:22,180
like you know how to push the envelope

248
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,620
and the boundaries when it comes to

249
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:26,830
color and playing with the eyes and

250
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:28,450
shadows so I chose one of my favorite

251
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:30,550
palettes from her collection I know that

252
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:33,060
you can put whatever your heart desires

253
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:34,330
to using that palette so good luck and

254
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,980
have fun

255
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:38,700
sister jockeys that we the Pat McGrath

256
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:41,140
mothership palette I've actually never

257
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:42,370
I've actually never tried it Pat McGrath

258
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:44,290
shadow before but I've heard they're

259
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:45,820
absolutely legendary Pat McGrath is an

260
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:47,140
iconic makeup artist on it very very

261
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,790
excited to play with this today I'm

262
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,830

and put this on my crease I'm gonna go

265
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:55,060
in pretty lightly with this because this

266
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:56,260
power actually does not have a lot of

267
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:57,460
matte shade so I really want to make

268
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:00,610
sure that this is blended out really

269
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:01,960
nicely and doesn't look too crazy next

270
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:03,220
add some holiday cheer I'm gonna grab

271
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,020

276
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,970

instead of been able to play with color

295
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:52,279

296
00:09:49,609 --> 00:09:53,449

the lashes from sister Laura Lee I also

applied some mascara to blend together

320
00:10:45,169 --> 00:10:48,470
that the real ones and the fake ones

321
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:50,149

the eyes I didn't really want to apply

323
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:53,509
too much mascara or any eyeliner so if

324
00:10:51,889 --> 00:10:55,220
they look a little bit wonky your just

325
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:57,319

00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:58,579

327
00:10:57,319 --> 00:11:00,169

328
00:10:58,579 --> 00:11:01,970
rest of the face and of course our next

329
00:11:00,169 --> 00:11:03,589
step is going to be the glow when I

330
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:05,600
think of a beautiful dewy skin and the

331
00:11:03,589 --> 00:11:07,459
highlight are ready to blind everybody

332
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,129

am extra just as we all are

337
00:11:17,689 --> 00:11:22,129
I could not narrow it down to just one

338
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:25,399
highlight so I sent you three three of

339
00:11:22,129 --> 00:11:28,309

344
00:11:36,739 --> 00:11:39,589
pop we all know this beautiful and

345
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,350
iconic highlighter

346
00:11:39,589 --> 00:11:43,610
she also sent me the Stila heavens q hi

347
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:45,679
leader I've actually never tried this

348
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:47,449
one up before as well as the makeup

349
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:49,819
rubber pigment in number and guarantee

350
00:11:47,449 --> 00:11:51,439
it number 13 I love this one as well

351
00:11:49,819 --> 00:11:54,110
this is definitely a recipe for a

352
00:11:51,439 --> 00:11:55,519
blinding glow okay literally I'm just

353
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:57,259
gonna apply all three highlighters say

354
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,879
because we gotta be extra for the

355
00:11:57,259 --> 00:12:00,829
Christmas season and of course gotta be

356
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:02,149
extra like sister Jacqueline so first we

357
00:12:00,829 --> 00:12:03,709
make our way I'm 501 Russians have been

358
00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:05,809
to the store in the shade

359
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:07,789
this calendar is really really sunny

360
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:09,319
it's like a beautiful pinky shade but

361
00:12:07,789 --> 00:12:10,909
it's definitely like a glow from with an

362
00:12:09,319 --> 00:12:12,529
type of highlighter not like a blinding

363
00:12:10,909 --> 00:12:20,509
glow so I'm gonna go over top of it with

364
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:21,860
a champagne pop and last but finally not

365
00:12:20,509 --> 00:12:23,149
least just for an extra pop of this

366
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:25,189

377
00:12:41,089 --> 00:12:45,309

378
00:12:42,439 --> 00:12:45,309

type of person until the last few weeks

386
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:02,340

00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:03,210

388
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,980

thank you sister project for the amazing

390
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:08,340
collection and for the amazing gifts so

391
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:10,710
last but certainly not least our faces

392
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:12,330
obviously all complete but we have one

393
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:14,130
last step and that is to set our face in

394
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:15,840
place so it lasts all day long to all

395
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:18,240
the Christmas festivities and all the

396
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:20,460
holiday cheer and for this product I

397
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,290
signed it to a youtuber that I have

398
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:24,050
loved for ever have looked up to for so

399
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:27,150
long but knows absolutely nothing about

400
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:28,050
beauty and that is this sir Shane Dawson

401
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:31,110
Wow

402
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:31,590
I love Christmas promo code Christ hi

403
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,180
James

404
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:34,770
so you wanted me to send you a setting

405
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:37,020
spray and I don't know what that means

406
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:41,010
now it's not technically a setting spray

407
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:42,570
but it is a catnip fray called yawa

408
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:44,040
Juwanna and you're not supposed to

409
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:49,830
ingest it or have it anywhere near your

410
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:52,320
face so good luck sister oh my god well

411
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:53,760
I may not be able to attract any boys

412
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,380
under the mistletoe this holiday season

413
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,900
but at least I know I'll be able to

414
00:13:55,380 --> 00:14:05,010
attract some Merry Christmas sister

415
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:07,110

00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,730

my favorite youtubers and friends I

418
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:12,510
throat Akkad I had zero idea what any of

419
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:14,010
these products were and I'm honestly so

420
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:15,390
proud of myself for holding back and not

421
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:17,520
opening it any of these presents that oh

422
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:19,020
filming this video but looking in the

423
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,880
mirror I feel like even though all these

424
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:22,350
products were a complete surprise we did

425
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,880
a really really good job and I honestly

426
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:26,310

427
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:28,650
