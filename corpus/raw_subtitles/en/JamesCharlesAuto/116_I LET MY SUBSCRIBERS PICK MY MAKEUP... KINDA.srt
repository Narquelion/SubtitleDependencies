the allure Mercier one with a 40% which

103
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,310

sweet peach whoo

105
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:20,250

107
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,760

underneath the eyes

126
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,590
our face is offset in place but we need

127
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,450
to add a little bit more dimension

128
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:06,940
because we're looking a little bit Flat

129
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:10,390

146
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,860

155
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:08,169

160
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,030

that's honestly so so dope

163
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:24,430
but let's put a twist on this I want the

164
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,140
city to be interesting so from this

165
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:28,720
point on I'm gonna be picking all the

166
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:30,460
least voted items from the poll to keep

167
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,010
this good and fresh so new products are

168
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:34,810
being used so to contour my face I'm

169
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:38,860
going to use the oddest Asya contouring

170
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:41,650
kit which has a 23% and then Mac oh God

171
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:45,130
dolly max I just definitely screwed

172
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:46,930
myself over which has 11% oh I regret

173
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:48,520
this I'm gonna grab this middle shade

174
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,830
right here in the palette it is the most

175
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:52,030
cool tone shade and I'm gonna use that

176
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:55,060
to start chiseling

177
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:58,210

178
00:05:55,060 --> 00:06:00,010

182
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:07,600

185
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:16,900
not going to blend this out very happily

186
00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:19,840
I'm just gonna pawn this latest that up

187
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:21,509
the dolly books blush that's enough

188
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,470
that's enough I can work with that

189
00:06:21,509 --> 00:06:25,300
it's for the video it's for the video

190
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:26,349
it's for the video all right so long my

191
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,120
face is baking in the oven we're gonna

192
00:06:26,349 --> 00:06:29,830
move on to the eyebrows and you guys

193
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,620
know I definitely always use a brow

194
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:34,180
pencil all the time so I'm a little bit

195
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,470
scared because I haven't feel like if

196
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:37,180
this is continuing to go how it's been

197
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:39,099
going that this is gonna win and that

198
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,690
means that another option we're gonna

199
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:43,000
have to use but regardless let's go

200
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:44,949
ahead and create the pole so today's

201
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,500

London liquid a brow cushion benefit of

foolproof brow powder which I literally

205
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:55,630
I don't think I've ever actually used in

206
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,460
my entire life and then the oddest Asya

207
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:58,750
dip brow pomade so we're a few minutes

208
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:00,819

39% it is at a hot minute since I've

211
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,759
used this baby and as you can see she's

212
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:12,190
basically a pretty much empty this was

213
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,409
like the number one recipe item for

214
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:18,190
getting the James Charles block brick

215
00:07:14,409 --> 00:07:19,780

that's the winning item no we obviously

220
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:31,539
use the brow powder no ah okay just

221
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:34,000
kidding I literally already forgot that

222
00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:36,070
I'm switching things up so the one who

223
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,139
is pulling the least sorry sweetie is

224
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:40,150
the benefit foolproof brow powder I

225
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:42,070
don't think I've ever once done my

226
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:43,180
eyebrows with powder I really don't

227
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:45,340
enjoy it I feel like that would just

228
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:46,930
look weird but you know what we're gonna

229
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,940
make this work so I'm gonna grab this

230
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:51,370
powder and an angle brush and try to

231
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:53,409
slay this these brows may take me a hot

232
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:55,900
second to get a snatch and on fleek I'm

233
00:07:53,409 --> 00:07:56,949
a little bit scared so while I'm doing

234
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,690
my brows I'm actually gonna post the

235
00:07:56,949 --> 00:08:00,190
poll for my eyeshadow palettes see your

236
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:02,020
sisters have plenty of time to vote

237
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:04,330
we're gonna choose between the Jocelyn

238
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:06,520
Hill palette from morphe the BH

239
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:09,250
Cosmetics take me back to at Brazell

240
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,599
palette the anasazi Beverly Hills soft

241
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:13,509
glam eyeshadow palette

242
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:15,999
and the brand-new kkw ex mario den

243
00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:18,189
ivanovitch huh as well alright the poll

244
00:08:15,999 --> 00:08:19,779
is up now let's try to slay these brows

245
00:08:18,189 --> 00:08:21,460
I think I may have a slight advantage

246
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:23,889
here being that I definitely do already

247
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:25,419
have a lot of brow hair so this is kind

248
00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:27,129
of just like filling in and shaping up

249
00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:29,259
but I literally cannot imagine trying to

250
00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:30,490
use a brow powder first of all that

251
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:32,500
doesn't have a lot of eyebrow hairs like

252
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:33,610
Hello I use a brow pencil or a pommy

253
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,620
because I feel like it adds a lot of

254
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:38,409
pigmentation and it really allows to

255
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:40,570
shape the brow whereas like powder like

256
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:42,099
Hello what is it even doing where is she

257
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:43,360
I feel like brow powder is definitely

258
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:44,769
for like the type of person that wears

259
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,519
makeup every day but doesn't want to

260
00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:48,519
look like they're wearing makeup

261
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,420
everyday boring cannot relate but I

262
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:50,560
think that's why I'm having so much

263
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:52,389
trouble with this because it's like

264
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:56,410
literally not showing up that I'm used

265
00:08:52,389 --> 00:08:57,970
to like brick block Lego sharpie eyebrow

266
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:59,260
moment but that's what I'm known for and

267
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,699
that's what I really really love I've

268
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:02,199
gotten to a point with my brows now

269
00:09:00,699 --> 00:09:03,519
where I actually I'm really happy with

270
00:09:02,199 --> 00:09:04,810
the shape and the amount of hair that I

271
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,459
have I can usually do them with a brow

272
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:09,430
pencil in less than time that it's at

273
00:09:06,459 --> 00:09:12,310
this point both eyebrows just took me 34

274
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:15,790
minutes and they still look that I don't

275
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:17,769
think I will ever ever do that again

276
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:19,149
once both rows are filled then I'm going

277
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:20,740
to use as my normal concealer that we

278
00:09:19,149 --> 00:09:22,839
got from before and a flat top brush

279
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:24,910
just to clean up underneath and then use

280
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:26,470
that concealer as an eyeshadow primer or

281
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:27,579
wherever look we decide to do wow I

282
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,720
literally don't even know where to put

283
00:09:27,579 --> 00:09:29,920
this concealer to define the brow

284
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,600
because I can't even see where the

285
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,790
eyebrow is in the first place let's move

286
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,910
on to eyeshadow so the pole has been up

287
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:39,100
for 20 minutes now and after 15,000

288
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:42,130
votes the Jaclyn hill paula is number

289
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:43,540
one with 35% jacqueline lover girl but

290
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:45,819
that pile has been used on the channel

291
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:47,230
way too many times so at this point I'm

292
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:49,930
kind of glad we're doing this twist and

293
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:52,720
a BH soft lamb is our loser today with

294
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:54,399
16% of both but she's not loser in my

295
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,110
heart because we're gonna use this

296
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,579
palette to create some type of look and

297
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:59,800
now I'm gonna run a poll to see it what

298
00:09:57,579 --> 00:10:03,430
style of eyeshadow we should use let's

299
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:05,319
see what type of eyeshadow look should I

300
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:08,139
do question mark

301
00:10:05,319 --> 00:10:10,589
let's do cut crease let's see choice

302
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:13,540
number two could be half cut crease

303
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:15,100
choice umber three smokey eye choice

304
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:17,140
ever poker beat halo

305
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:18,850
let's see what the sisters have to say

306
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:20,769
okay I clearly play myself because I

307
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:22,990
wanted to switch up but you sisters are

308
00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:24,339
way too smart and you caught on to the

309
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:27,970
fact that the everyday stuff was winning

310
00:10:24,339 --> 00:10:30,100
so I'm gonna reverse reverse

311
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:32,500
and go back to figure you number one

312
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:34,779
option because I never do halo eyes so

313
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:38,370
I'm gonna put on a halo eye because 40%

314
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:40,570
of people want a helo eye this is a mess

315
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:42,040
but let's be real what James Charles

316
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:43,990
video isn't a mess I'm gonna start off

317
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,459
our car be in the shade oranges soda and

318
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:47,290
using that as my transition and popping

319
00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:49,300
that right in my crease so everything

320
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:50,920
blends nicely together I'm just gonna

321
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:52,630
use circular windshield wiper motions as

322
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:54,339
usual but I'm keeping the shadow

323
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:56,800
actually more a rounded shape but you

324
00:10:54,339 --> 00:10:58,269
guys know I love a good winged out

325
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,459
shadow moment that really lifts up the

326
00:10:58,269 --> 00:11:01,870
eyes but for a sister halo eye I

327
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:04,899
definitely want to keep it more round

328
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:07,300
and really accentuate the circular halo

329
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:09,100
shape next to the morphe m4 33 I'm gonna

330
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:11,050
grab the shade of burnt orange and I'm

331
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,190
gonna pop that right in the crease once

332
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:15,519
again making sure to keep the eye shape

333
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:17,740
really really circular and large we love

334
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,850
a blended sister okay next is the more

335
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:20,500
defined blending brush I'm gonna dip

336
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:21,910
into the shade it's Janna right up in

337
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,500
here and use this to it define out the

338
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:25,149
crease a little bit more and then

339
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,220
finally using a really tiny a tapered

340
00:11:25,149 --> 00:11:28,420
blending brush whoo that's a mouthful

341
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,430
I'm going to dip into the shades

342
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:32,320
mulberry and a little bit of Cypress

343
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:34,300
number and just really deepen up the

344
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,589
crease one last time I feel like it's

345
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:37,779
been a hot minute since I've done like a

346
00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:39,190
darker smoky type of look I think I've

347
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:41,800
been doing it that's why it looks a lot

348
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:43,540
recently so holding this video let's

349
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,550
switch it up a little bit make her dark

350
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:47,680
make her a little bit spooky why not

351
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:49,240
this outer corner still is looking at

352
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,339
walki though why don't it's not blend

353
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,779
out it is clearly been a hot minute

354
00:11:51,339 --> 00:11:54,490
since I've done a halo eye because I

355
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:57,310
cannot figure out how to blend this

356
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:58,990
outer edge to save my life points let's

357
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:00,370
play on hello so now that we have the

358
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:01,630
crease I'll blend it out and define I

359
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:04,930
want to make this into an actual halo

360
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:06,670
eye so I'm gonna grab my morphe m42 one

361
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:09,420
brush and a little bit of my concealer

362
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:11,740
from before and I guess cut the crease

363
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:12,970
those muscles of your cut crease but

364
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:14,649
just in the center portion so we can

365
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:15,610
build out that halo to do the actual

366
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:16,990
heal the way I'm going to do the same

367
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:19,180
exact colors that I used in the crease

368
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:20,290
and the same order as well popping them

369
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,640
right on top of the concealer and I'm

370
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:23,680
gonna start off with the shade orange

371
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,660
soda and pop that right in the center

372
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,730
but I am gonna leave a little bit of a

373
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,260
strip in but

374
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:29,730
you know for a shimmer shadow in a

375
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:31,529
second I'm just packing the shade on

376
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:33,899
there making sure to get right up to

377
00:12:31,529 --> 00:12:36,180
that line of concealer so we get that

378
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:37,860
cut halo I type of love I'm gonna grab

379
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:39,510
the shade see Jana and pop that right

380
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:41,220
next door next we're gonna use Cypress

381
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:43,589
Ember on a fluffy pencil brush and pop

382
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:45,360
this on the inner corner as well as the

383
00:12:43,589 --> 00:12:46,649
outer corner next to the small concealer

384
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,600
brush like this one this is the morphe

385
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:51,029
at 19 I'm gonna dip into the shade or

386
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,769
right up here called a bronze and I'm

387
00:12:51,029 --> 00:12:54,930
gonna give my brush a good spread of mac

388
00:12:52,769 --> 00:12:56,760
fix+ so it's very very pigmented and

389
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:58,529
metallic and I'm gonna pop that right in

390
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,610
the center of that little halo so the

391
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:01,470
upper lip portion of the shadow is

392
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:03,329
finally Donna thank God I was not too

393
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:04,949
confident this at first but I'm really

394
00:13:03,329 --> 00:13:07,740
liking the direction that's going now so

395
00:13:04,949 --> 00:13:09,209
let's talk liner do we want to do it we

396
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:12,389

choice number three glitter liner for

400
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:24,209
this portion and choice number four

401
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:26,399
would be black and glitter liner let's

402
00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:28,440
see so once this pulls done am i picking

403
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,420
the most voted option now or the least

404
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:33,420
voted option now this would be a fast I

405
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:34,680
know what I'm doing Oh while I'm waiting

406
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,970
for the results to come in on the liner

407
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,410
Paul I'm gonna quickly go ahead and do

408
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:38,699
the eye shadow off-camera on the other

409
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:40,290
all right I'll be right back to finish

410
00:13:38,699 --> 00:13:42,420
off the look so we are back and both

411
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:44,160
eyes are currently done and a slave and

412
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:45,959
as even as I could possibly get them I

413
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,190
always hate doing a halo eyes or eye

414
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:49,410
shapes like this because my eyes are

415
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:50,850
very very uneven and always is a little

416
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:52,649
bit wonky but you know what I'm happy

417
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:54,060
with where we're at the polls are

418
00:13:52,649 --> 00:13:55,649
running for 20 minutes now and at low

419
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:58,769
state the results are black and glitter

420
00:13:55,649 --> 00:14:00,000
liner is waiting by 40% let's do it I'm

421
00:13:58,769 --> 00:14:02,310
gonna use the Urban Decay Midnight

422
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,380
Cowboy glitter liner and first pop that

423
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:06,120
on the center of the lid to really make

424
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:07,920
that halo eye pop and then I'm also

425
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:10,920
gonna trace out a really thin line right

426
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,839
at the top of that halo to cut the halo

427
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,130
crease might as well go all out and be a

428
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:15,660
little bit extra at this point I'm gonna

429
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:18,510
throw in a black winged liner as well

430
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:20,550
using the NYX matte liquid liner you

431
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:21,899
guys did before a glitter liner too so

432
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:23,940
not only am I gonna put it on the lid

433
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:26,399
but let's be a little bit extra today I

434
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:28,110
want to do a double glitter winged liner

435
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,730
I may be regarding that but you know

436
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:32,190
what go big or go home

437
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:34,640
I forgot how hard this wants to do oh my

438
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:36,590
god okay she's on there

439
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,640
oh that was a lot I don't even know if I

440
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:40,040
like this anymore

441
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:44,030
whatever too late now oh my god had to

442
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:46,940
throw in the other I know what okay

443
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:48,830
honestly it has been a very very very

444
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:50,180
long time since I have finished my

445
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:51,950
makeup and looked in the mirror and not

446
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:55,760
been happy with the result but for some

447
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:57,500
reason I absolutely hate how this is

448
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,580
turning out I don't know why but you

449
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,040
know what we're just gonna keep trucking

450
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:03,590
through hopefully it'll come together in

451
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:06,830
the end but next up is going to be the

452
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:08,800
eyelashes and at this point go big go

453
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:12,920
home so today we were choosing between

454
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:16,160
Lily lashes in the style mikonos house

455
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:20,270
Elijah is ikonics Lily lashes and the

456
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:23,590
style Miami's and a good and fresh 301

457
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:26,120
[Laughter]

458
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:28,070
you're kidding the poles been going for

459
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:31,070
10 minutes now and unfortunately my

460
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:32,870
sister 301 did not win we're gonna pump

461
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:34,490
on a pair of the Lily lashes Miami's

462
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:36,800
today I thought I'd wear these all the

463
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:39,400
time are you guys I love that you know

464
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:44,180
my makeup routine so well but this video

465
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:45,530
I had never wanted a video to be over

466
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:48,470
with more in my entire life I don't know

467
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:49,730
what its way on right now let me hear

468
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:51,440
that I just accidentally cut off half

469
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:53,150
the eyelash you know how I said earlier

470
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:58,760
that lashes could potentially save this

471
00:15:53,150 --> 00:16:01,190
look I lied I still don't love it but I

472
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:03,800
will say that it does look significantly

473
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:06,110
better and less like horrible with a

474
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,310
pair of lashes on and although it's not

475
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:08,600
my favorite look that I've ever done I

476
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:11,150
will say that it does kind of look

477
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,770
relatively pretty relatively okay and

478
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:13,760
maybe can be fixed with a little bit of

479
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:15,650
sister phase tuned

480
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,300
so I'm trying to stay positive I'm kind

481
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:18,500
of stay motivated because I want to

482
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:20,990
finish this video and I'm honestly

483
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:22,850
having a lot of fun doing this so now

484
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:24,500
that the eyes are all complete let's

485
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:25,580
move on to the rest of the face starting

486
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,110
off with highlighter

487
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:29,060
we're gonna choose between for today

488
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:32,120
starting off with mary lou manizer from

489
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:34,460
the balm the Anasazi beverly hills exxon

490
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:37,040
resi collab Anasazi beverly hills so

491
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:39,560
hollywood might go to or the jeffree

492
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,390
star cosmetics 24-karat highlighting

493
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,950
palettes the results are in and by an

494
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:46,850
overwhelming majority the jeffree star

495
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:48,290
skin frost palette won with 55% of the

496
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:51,560
boat who i'm going to

497
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:53,690
myself a good spread of mac fix+ because

498
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:56,139
I've been having a lot of powder on my

499
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:58,550
face and I'm gonna dip into the shade

500
00:16:56,139 --> 00:17:02,660
sarcophagus in this palette and get my

501
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:04,189
glow on oh you're kidding me

502
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,360
I know Geoffrey does not play around

503
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,850
when it comes to his makeup and

504
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,049
pigmentation but that is probably the

505
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:12,260
brightest highlighter I've ever seen in

506
00:17:09,049 --> 00:17:14,600
my entire life like what the hack I was

507
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:16,370
going for a more soft and subtle look

508
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,230
today by I guess this is gonna have to

509
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:20,780
do I'm gonna mix a little bit of the

510
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:22,370
shade King Tut in with the sarcophagus

511
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:26,750
for the next cheek so it's not like

512
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:28,459
overwhelming wow that's insane a whole

513
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:30,470
I'm gonna pop a little bit of this right

514
00:17:28,459 --> 00:17:32,270
above my brow bones as well you guys

515
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:33,740
know I love having up here to widen out

516
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:35,720
my face a little bit and just bring more

517
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:36,710
attention to this region I feel like it

518
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,540
gives a really really natural and

519
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:40,220
beautiful like glow from within take a

520
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:42,860
look even though this palette is not

521
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:44,570
exactly a glow from within type of the

522
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,830
highlighter clearly also how would you

523
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:47,030
guys feel about a sister James and

524
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:49,730
Geoffrey collab I feel like that would

525
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:50,900
low-key be kind of iconic let me know

526
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:52,280
I'm actually gonna skip out on

527
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,450
highlighting the inner corners today

528
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,919
because I really want to keep the focus

529
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:57,200
on the halo eye right in the center of

530
00:17:54,919 --> 00:17:58,610
the eyes and not like in the corners of

531
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,320
the eyes if that makes sense

532
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:03,169
but I am gonna grab a little bit more of

533
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:05,840
a sarcophagus mixed with King Tut tap

534
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:07,549
the excess off the brush then I'm going

535
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:10,940
to use this to highlight right down the

536
00:18:07,549 --> 00:18:12,320
tip of my nose Oh what from this angle

537
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:15,470
this look looks really pretty actually

538
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:19,130
okay maybe this isn't the worst only

539
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:22,100
from this angle though hmm and last but

540
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:24,200
certainly not least thank you lord if we

541
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:26,480
have the Liberty to us and for this at

542
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:29,840
once again we have four options starting

543
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:34,790
off with a glossy nude a kind of a brown

544
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:36,380
a cool tone gray lip a red or a pop of

545
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:38,240
color and I didn't pick out a color for

546
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:40,520
pop of color if that one went I'll host

547
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,890
a separate poll again letting everybody

548
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:44,600
else pick a pop of color let's do it you

549
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:46,260
guys want the results are in in our last

550
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:49,380
poll as

551
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:52,950
a glossy nude honestly not surprised and

552
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:54,840
it won with 36% out of 10,000 votes in

553
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:56,850
only nine minutes you guys literally yes

554
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:59,970
laid this challenge I feel like a purple

555
00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:02,160
or a blue or a green what I've looked

556
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:04,350
literally so bad at this look and I feel

557
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,299
like at least a glossy nude will kind of

558
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:08,010
tie everything together even though I

559
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:11,370
still hate bass you guys

560
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:13,830
it is currently 436 here in California I

561
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:16,650
started filming this at 11:30 this

562
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:20,040
morning it has been five hours now this

563
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:21,090
has been a crazy wild ride we had a lot

564
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,679
of ups and downs

565
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:25,169
a few emotional breakdowns on the way

566
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:27,179
but we are finally done with the

567
00:19:25,169 --> 00:19:29,190
completed look completely chosen by you

568
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:30,840
guys even though I'm not obsessed with

569
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:32,070
the finished look today I think that

570
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,720
having you guys pick my makeup routine

571
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:35,640
and products is one of the most fun

572
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,230
things I've ever done and I really

573
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,610
really really love this challenge I

574
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:40,049
forgot to say this was slowing the outro

575
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:41,880
earlier sorry guys I was very very

576
00:19:40,049 --> 00:19:44,400
focused on finishing the video and

577
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,870
getting my makeup off my face but thank

578
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,179
you so much everybody who participated

579
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:49,549
in that like seriously oh my god it

580
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:52,169
means so much to me that literally

581
00:19:49,549 --> 00:19:53,790
thousands of you guys we're sitting and

582
00:19:52,169 --> 00:19:55,710
literally waiting for me for five hours

583
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:57,299
so I found that video to vote on those

584
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:58,740
polls and to pick which products I would

585
00:19:57,299 --> 00:19:59,790
put my face like that is really really

586
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:02,160
so cool and just goes to show how

587
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:03,570
amazing you guys are and obviously we

588
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,559
did it do a little flip flop and I was

589
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,820
making fun of the fact that all my

590
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,860
everyday makeup products were being

591
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:09,419
picked but that just shows that you guys

592
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,620
that really do care about my videos and

593
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:12,000
that you pay attention to the products

594
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:13,440
that I'm using and that I'm loving so

595
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,429

599
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:21,750
