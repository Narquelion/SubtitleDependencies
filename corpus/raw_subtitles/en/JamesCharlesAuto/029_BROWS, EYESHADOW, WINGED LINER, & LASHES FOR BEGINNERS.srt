step of my eye makeup is always my

57
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,659
eyebrows some people like to do them

58
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,399
first I really don't understand how they

59
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:48,990
do that hurry personally I always like

60
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:50,549
to do them after I base and before the

61
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,649
eye shadow and then carve it out Suika

62
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:53,670
are really really nice and even base so

63
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:54,990
I'm just gonna show you guys how I like

64
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,399
to do with mine today here in the makeup

65
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,740
community there's a very famous saying

66
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,750
about brows and that is that brows frame

67
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,340
your face and this is probably one of

68
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:04,229
the most true things I have ever heard

69
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,460
in my entire life the most common

70
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:07,590
question I get when it comes to brows is

71
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,789
how do I find at the perfect shape if

72
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,289
you guys want to start day for a very

73
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:12,780
very long time you would know that my

74
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:13,470
brows have undergone quite the huge

75
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,480
transformation

76
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:17,430
and definitely for the better when I

77
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,190
first started off they were super super

78
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:22,680
thick and had literally no arch to them

79
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:24,480
and this brow shape after very very long

80
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,670
time and a lot of nasty comments I

81
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,010
finally realized was driving my entire

82
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:31,770
face down no matter how hard I some eyes

83
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:34,080
or smiled it still somehow looked like

84
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:35,730
my brows were frowning and I obviously

85
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,410
realized that this was not the looks

86
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:38,760
that I wanted to go for once I solved my

87
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:40,620
pride and finally admitted that my

88
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,800
blocked brows were absolutely awful i

89
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,690
tweeze a ton of my eyebrows off to make

90
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,250
them a lot more arched my eyebrow

91
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:49,140
transformation was still not exactly

92
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:51,420
complete though I wore those eyebrows

93
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:53,910
for a good hot minute you guys love them

94
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:56,130
I love them but more recently I actually

95
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:58,800
changed them a little bit more by

96
00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:01,290
tweezing off almost my entire brow tail

97
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,300
my eyebrows used to grow to around down

98
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:05,220
here so more recently I've been lifting

99
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:08,100
my tail upwards which gives my face a

100
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:09,840
more lifted and snatched look and also

101
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:12,270
gives me a more room for eye shadow as

102
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,800
you can see over on this eye brow shape

103
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,850
is a very very personal thing and of

104
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,160
course I'm gonna give you guys a few

105
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:18,600
tips and tricks in a second but I would

106
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:21,180
say that the absolute best way to figure

107
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,860
out your best brows is by taking selfies

108
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,570
it was through that that I realized the

109
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,280
errors that I was doing with my brows I

110
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:28,019
was able to kind of fix them and perfect

111
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,160
them through experimenting I understand

112
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:30,780
that you guys don't have hours every

113
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,550
single day to experiment

114
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:35,160
so I'm gonna show you one super helpful

115
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:36,720
rule / tip and trick that can really

116
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,700
help you shape your brows this super

117
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,840
simple Brown trick involves three lines

118
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,700
of reference and all you're going to

119
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,260
need is your favorite brow pencil today

120
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,450
I'm using the Anasazi eyebrow pencil in

121
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,890
the shade medium brown the first rule of

122
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:48,930
thumb is that the inside of your brow

123
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:51,150
should always align with the outside of

124
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:53,610
your nostril so if you can see on this

125
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:55,590
side right here it starts right when I

126
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:57,390
align it my brow pencil if we move over

127
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:59,040
to this eye we can see that they align

128
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:01,620
at once again perfectly so I'm just

129
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,330
going to draw one little line to mark

130
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:05,190
the center of my brow the next rule of

131
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:07,230
thumb is that when looking forward at

132
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:09,510
the beginning of your brow arch should

133
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:11,489
align perfectly with the outside edge of

134
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:13,080
your pupil and as you can see they do

135
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:15,330
moving over to the other side you can

136
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:18,030
see bingo right here

137
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:20,130
so I'm just going to make my mark and

138
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:21,630
finally for the tail of your brow if you

139
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:23,130
hold your brow pencil at the corner of

140
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:26,190
your nose and head it out the

141
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:28,050
of your eye your browser Tut's just like

142
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:30,270
that so once again coming to this site

143
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:32,820
if I hold my pencil right like this I'm

144
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:34,020
gonna my brow tail right there now that

145
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,220
we have all three of those points mapped

146
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:37,110
out let's go ahead and actually start

147
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,430
filling in the brow the most common

148
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,350
question I get when it comes to drawing

149
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:43,050
your brows is how do I make them look

150
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:45,450
define but still a natural and hair like

151
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:46,650
my answer to that question is always use

152
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:48,300
a brow pencil

153
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:50,160
I love broad pencils because the tip is

154
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,200
fine so you can really sketch in a tiny

155
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,180
little hairs for a natural and realistic

156
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,190
effect and you can also change the

157
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,750
pressure for a darker look on the tail

158
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:59,610
and a lighter look in the inner corner

159
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:01,800
so you still get that beautiful ombre

160
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:02,640
defined look to start filling them and I

161
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,470
always like to start in the inner

162
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,840
corners I'm gonna hold my pencil

163
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:09,300
vertically to my face and I'm gonna use

164
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,490
a very very light pressure and just

165
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:13,260
lightly place my pencil and just kind of

166
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:16,050
flick it upwards to create

167
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:17,100
natural-looking hair strokes you

168
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,720
definitely gonna want to start off with

169
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,520
light pressure and then press harder as

170
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,590
you get through the brow if you start

171
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,850
off too dark in the inner corner you're

172
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:25,260
gonna end up with the block broad which

173
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:27,030
is obviously not the look that we're

174
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:29,310
going for once the area is although then

175
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:31,740
I like to take my pencil and keeping our

176
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:34,830
guidelines in sight I just like to

177
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:36,900
underline the bottom of the brow and

178
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:39,360
just kind of map out where I'm going to

179
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:41,460
go once again using really really light

180
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:45,150
pressure and creating hair like little

181
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:46,710
strokes so it looks natural right to the

182
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:48,990
dot that we've created for the tail and

183
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:51,200
then once I have the tail I'm just going

184
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:54,500
to start by filling in that outer

185
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:57,570
triangle and start to bring it back

186
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:59,220
upwards right back into the eyebrow when

187
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:00,720
purchasing a brow pencil if possible of

188
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:03,000
course you should always get one that

189
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,290
has a spoolie at the end I freaking love

190
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,520
these things that they are still half of

191
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:06,930
while doing brows and throughout the

192
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,700
entire process I always like to go

193
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:10,230
through and kind of brush through the

194
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,670
hairs just make sure the product is

195
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:14,400
getting blended together so nothing

196
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:15,540
looks too intense and too harsh and also

197
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,190
moves the hair around so you can kind of

198
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:19,110
see areas that you missed I need to add

199
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:20,760
a more product to once I have the bottom

200
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:21,630
and the tail all sketched out and don't

201
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,430
worry if it's Bessie we're going to

202
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:25,370
clean it up later of course I like to

203
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:28,200
take my spoolie and brush the hairs

204
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:29,940
downwards and then I like to do the top

205
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,620
of the brow I always like to make sure

206
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,850
that I'm brushing my hair away so I can

207
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,650
really see the area that I need to fill

208
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,310
and because if I do it this way it's

209
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:37,140
really easy to

210
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:38,370
time's go above the brow and then your

211
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,840
brows just keep getting thicker and

212
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:42,600
thicker and thicker and thicker and that

213
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,250
is usually not the best look similar to

214
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,200
the front I'm using medium pressure and

215
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:49,230
just sketching in light hair like

216
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:51,930
strokes just to structure out the top of

217
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:53,340
the brow just like this and once I get

218
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:55,740
to the outer corner I'm just going to

219
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:57,750
connect it right into the tail and make

220
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:59,490
sure I didn't miss any areas filling it

221
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:01,020
and once I'm happy with how the brow is

222
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:03,360
filled and I always like to take a brow

223
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,290
gel now this step is totally optional I

224
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,090
would definitely recommend it for people

225
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:07,320
like me if you have a lot of brow hairs

226
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:08,640
and you want to make sure that they're

227
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,440
laying in the right direction up but you

228
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,240
can totally skip this and save a lot of

229
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,940
money if you have not a lot of brow

230
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,250
hairs totally up to you but I'm gonna

231
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:18,630
using the benefit 24-hour brow center I

232
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:21,150
really like this one because it is like

233
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:23,220
cement for your brow hairs it really

234
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:24,570
locks it in place and I'm gonna do is

235
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,220
just run through the brow hairs and

236
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:28,020
brush them right in the right direction

237
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:30,480
so they're laying inside of where I

238
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:31,770
filled in that brow as you can see by

239
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,300
doing that too and moving around the

240
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:34,800
brow hairs I'm definitely missing a

241
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,660
little bit of definition right up in

242
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,700
here so I'm just gonna go back into the

243
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:41,040
pencil and add in a few more light

244
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:42,300
strokes just to fill it in now the last

245
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,340
of my brow routine which is always my

246
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,720
favorite part is cleaning them up to do

247
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,580
this I'm just gonna grab a lot top

248
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,920
concealer brush like this this is the

249
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:51,630
morphe m-43 - and your favorite full

250
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,670
coverage concealer for me it is

251
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:55,260
heart-shaped tape and I'm just gonna put

252
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:57,120
a little bit of a dollop of this on the

253
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:58,890
back of my hand get a little bit on with

254
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,120
that brush and then I'm just gonna go

255
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:05,700
right in and start cleaning up the brow

256
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:07,020
very very carefully I really love

257
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,460
cleaning up the brows because not only

258
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,680
does it give them a much cleaner

259
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:12,120
appearance but if you make anyone's

260
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,980
takes while filling it it can see there

261
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,870
is the perfect way to fix them up and

262
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:17,490
make sure they are super super snatched

263
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,140
once I'm satisfied with the line I

264
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:21,120
always like to take the excess of that

265
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:23,040
concealer on that same exact brush and

266
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,110
put the remainder of it right on my

267
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:27,570
eyelid and I'm gonna use this concealer

268
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:28,920
today as an eyelid primer which is a

269
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:30,660
really really great hot because I do

270
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,610
almost the same exact thing so it's a

271
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,930
great way to save a lot of money in your

272
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:36,300
makeup routine with the dense packing

273
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:37,740
brush like this this is the morphe m33 5

274
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,420
this is my all-time favorite for setting

275
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,850
the eyelids in place I'm gonna dip this

276
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:43,770
into a little bit of my setting powder

277
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:45,510
pop off the excess and I'm just going to

278
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:46,350
make sure that concealer is right in

279
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:48,540
place because we

280
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:50,640
not one or I shadow to crease throughout

281
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:52,860
the day there we go that is our brows

282
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,960
laid and in place and now we finally get

283
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:56,640
to move on to the fun part the eyeshadow

284
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,380
for today's I try to look I did decide

285
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,970
to go with a sunset half cut crease

286
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,530
which like I said and I was a little bit

287
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:03,060
of a crazy look for most of you guys out

288
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:04,350
there but I have a lot of different

289
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,850
techniques and tips and tricks that I

290
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:07,050
want to talk about because a lot of the

291
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:09,390
questions I received it talked about

292
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:10,920
blending and using a lot of colors makes

293
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:12,780
it really easy for you guys to see how

294
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,980
the blending techniques work before we

295
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:16,380
hop into the shadows I want to quickly

296
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:18,060
talk about makeup brushes because good

297
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:20,370
working tools or an absolute necessity

298
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:21,960
to any successful makeup look you guys

299
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:23,340
know that I have an avid makeup lover

300
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,020
and when it comes to brushes I will

301
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:26,970
admit I'm a little bit of a hoarder I

302
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:28,950
mean this is literally my container of

303
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:31,020
fluffy eyeshadow blending brushes alone

304
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:32,880
but I understand it that is really

305
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:35,610
unrealistic for you guys makeup can be

306
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:37,020
ridiculously expensive so I compiled a

307
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:38,610
list of eight different brushes that I

308
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:40,560
think would be a necessity to any makeup

309
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:42,540
lovers collection and I think that could

310
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,000
achieve any sort of eyeshadow look

311
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:50,280
desire first we have the morphe m4 for

312
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:52,590
one this retails for $6.00 ition shades

313
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:54,390
next we have the morphe m4 is 3 3 yet

314
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:55,980
this is the best crease brush in the

315
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:58,050
entire world and you need this in your

316
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:59,880
collection I could probably do an entire

317
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:01,590
eyeshadow look with just one of these

318
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:04,140
brushes and I'm not kidding when they

319
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:06,900
say I have 27 of them in my collection

320
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:08,910
you obviously did not need 27 but if

321
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:11,130
your eyeshadow lover like me I'd

322
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:12,810
recommend getting at least 3 of these

323
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:15,840
because you can really use them for any

324
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:18,120
single look this is the amma 506 and

325
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:20,280
retails once again for 6 dollars and is

326
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,930
a fluffy pointed brush which i really

327
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:24,090
really love it for detailed crease work

328
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:26,580
or blending out an outer v this is the

329
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:28,530
amat 2 to 4 and it is a round flat

330
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:30,510
concealer brush and this is my all-time

331
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:33,270
favorite brush for either carving out

332
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:35,880
the brows or doing a cut creases this is

333
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:37,890
the amma 205 and it is also a round flat

334
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,930
concealer brush but it is much smaller

335
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:41,940
and instead of using this for concealer

336
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:44,940
i actually used this to pack shadow on

337
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:47,760
the lid finally this is the m14 9 it is

338
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:49,260
a tiny round and a bullet brush and I

339
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,630
use this for highlighting the inner

340
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:53,340
corners highlighting the brow bone and a

341
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:54,780
buffing shadow onto the lower lash line

342
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:57,390
you can get all eight of those brushes

343
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:58,440
for only $35 using code James and I

344
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,899
think those will set you up for success

345
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,699
with

346
00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:01,839
any eye shadow look you want to do for

347
00:11:00,699 --> 00:11:04,509
my silence today I'm gonna be using the

348
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,519
35 B palette I'm first ending at Miami

349
00:11:04,509 --> 00:11:08,529
for 401 which is the biggest fluffy

350
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:09,970
brush and dip into the yellow shade in

351
00:11:08,529 --> 00:11:11,649
the bottom corner

352
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:13,209
for this particular look our yellow is

353
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:14,829
going to act as our transition shade

354
00:11:13,209 --> 00:11:16,600
holding the brush at an upward angle I'm

355
00:11:14,829 --> 00:11:19,509
gonna go in right into my crease and

356
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,910
start using a circular motions to place

357
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:24,339
that shadow right up in there and to

358
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:25,899
blend it out when applying the shadows

359
00:11:24,339 --> 00:11:28,059
I'm making sure to pack the color right

360
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:30,399
in the crease and then doing my circular

361
00:11:28,059 --> 00:11:31,569
motions to blend them out this will make

362
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,040
sure that the shadow doesn't get all the

363
00:11:31,569 --> 00:11:34,929
way up to the brow bone and look muddy

364
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,329
and unblended because that is obviously

365
00:11:34,929 --> 00:11:39,189
not what we want you want to keep the

366
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:41,860
yellow up here in order to make a nice

367
00:11:39,189 --> 00:11:43,629
transition between skintone color and

368
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:44,980
then your crease next we're gonna move

369
00:11:43,629 --> 00:11:46,869
on to our darker shade which in this

370
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:48,610
case is going to be our orange so to do

371
00:11:46,869 --> 00:11:49,540
this I'm gonna grab my AM 4-3-3 which

372
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:51,490
like I was saying is my favorite a

373
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:53,350
crease brush and I'm gonna dip into the

374
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:54,939
bright orange shade I'm still gonna hold

375
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:56,230
my brush at a slight upward angle but

376
00:11:54,939 --> 00:11:58,029
I'm gonna hold this one a lot more

377
00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:00,429
horizontal to my face and is staying

378
00:11:58,029 --> 00:12:02,350
exactly where we want it in the crease

379
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:04,360
and the outside bristles of the brush

380
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:06,339
are gonna do the job of blending it into

381
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,959
that yellow shade without bringing it

382
00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:09,160
all the way up to the brow bone so much

383
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:10,540
of the yellow shade I'm going to Pat

384
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,399
that shadow in there to make sure it's

385
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:14,079
very very pigmented and then just do a

386
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,059
mix of windshield wiper motions and

387
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,769
small circular motions to make sure it

388
00:12:16,059 --> 00:12:18,850
is evenly blended out

389
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:20,259
it's really important to keep in mind

390
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:21,490
the pressure that you're using on your

391
00:12:20,259 --> 00:12:23,829
brush throughout your entire makeup

392
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:25,240
process you want to use heavier pressure

393
00:12:23,829 --> 00:12:26,679
when applying the shadows to make sure

394
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,029
that they really get pressed in there so

395
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:30,040
they're pigmented but when you're

396
00:12:28,029 --> 00:12:32,230
blending them out you want to use super

397
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,569
super light pressure I mean I'm

398
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:36,490
literally barely even touching my eyelid

399
00:12:34,569 --> 00:12:37,839
at this point it is just the tips of the

400
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:39,189
bristles that are running against it

401
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,319
that are really gonna make everything

402
00:12:39,189 --> 00:12:42,879
blended together without placing any new

403
00:12:41,319 --> 00:12:44,379
product on there once you're happy with

404
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:45,879
that blending to make sure it's really

405
00:12:44,379 --> 00:12:47,740
perfect I'm gonna go back into my

406
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:50,410
original transition shade brush dip into

407
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:52,870
a little bit more yellow tap off any

408
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:54,970
excess and then go right over the border

409
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:55,869
between the orange and the yellow to

410
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:57,429
make sure that everything is blended

411
00:12:55,869 --> 00:12:59,889
together and that the yellow doesn't get

412
00:12:57,429 --> 00:13:01,480
lost in all of the blending and brush

413
00:12:59,889 --> 00:13:03,040
work our next darker shade is going to

414
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,799
be our red so once again I'm gonna grab

415
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,580
another M 4-3-3 brush and dip into the

416
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:08,470
wrench

417
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:10,000
right up in here when I hide in this

418
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:12,040
color I am actually holding the brush

419
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,510
almost completely horizontal to my face

420
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,610
to make sure that the color gets

421
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:17,500
distributed into exactly the crease and

422
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:19,839
the crease only and doesn't get blended

423
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,670
anywhere upwards I'm next going to go

424
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,279
back into my empire 3z that have the

425
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:26,260
orange side on it and blend right over

426
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:28,540
that red in between to make sure that

427
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:30,010
the orange doesn't get lost and to

428
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:32,740
ensure that there is an even transition

429
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:34,360
between the yellow and the red it takes

430
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:36,310
a lot of practice a lot of patience and

431
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:38,320
a lot of time to really master the art

432
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:39,970
of blending and the best way to do it is

433
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,610
to really go in and make sure that every

434
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:44,740
color is blended seamlessly together and

435
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:46,750
not cutting any corners next is gonna be

436
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:48,880
our final color which is dark purple so

437
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:51,250
for this I'm gonna con Miami 506 which

438
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,470
is that tiny little fluffy brush and dip

439
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:55,540
it to the cool tone of dark purple shade

440
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:56,920
right up in here when I go into my

441
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:59,709
darker shade of eyeshadow whether it be

442
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:01,510
a purple black dark blue or even maroon

443
00:13:59,709 --> 00:14:03,430
I always like to start off in the outer

444
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:05,529
corner because that's where I really

445
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:07,269
want most of the product to be a focused

446
00:14:05,529 --> 00:14:08,829
and when I grab the product always make

447
00:14:07,269 --> 00:14:10,660
sure to not really put a lot on my brush

448
00:14:08,829 --> 00:14:12,100
as you can see I really just packed it

449
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:14,920
in there and barely anything showed up

450
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:16,390
but that's what we want my best i shadow

451
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,520
tip for you guys to do it would be apply

452
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:20,410
a little bit of product blend it out and

453
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:22,750
then see if you need more and if you do

454
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:24,370
that add more product and slowly build

455
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,990
your way up the worst thing you can do

456
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:28,270
is start off dark and try to fix it

457
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:30,130
because there's usually no going back

458
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:32,020
I'm applying the shadow carefully in my

459
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:33,670
outer V which is just basically like

460
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:35,529
this socket where your Jenner right up

461
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:36,850
in here where your eye sits I did get a

462
00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:38,829
few questions on how to sketch it out

463
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:41,230
but literally just imagine that there's

464
00:14:38,829 --> 00:14:42,910
a V from the corner of your eye right up

465
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:44,529
into your crease if they were to connect

466
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:46,390
and that is where you should have put

467
00:14:44,529 --> 00:14:48,160
your outer V and then will the ever

468
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:50,529
excess shadow I have left I'm just going

469
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,690
to drag that into the crease just to

470
00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:53,829
provide a little bit of dimension you

471
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:55,959
guys should know the joke this plant guy

472
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:58,240
with my red and 4-3-3 it gonna blend

473
00:14:55,959 --> 00:14:59,709
right over the edge make sure that the

474
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,140
purple doesn't get too intense and we

475
00:14:59,709 --> 00:15:03,820
don't lose that red and then finally our

476
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:05,230
yellow we get to take a break from the

477
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,029
shadow for a few short minutes because

478
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:09,070
now we get to the fun part cutting at

479
00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:10,360
the crease you guys know I love about

480
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:11,709
half cut crease and is on my all-time

481
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,149
favorite makeup looks to do and I'm

482
00:15:11,709 --> 00:15:14,980
gonna show you guys how I do mine today

483
00:15:13,149 --> 00:15:17,290
the most common question I get when it

484
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:19,760
comes to cut creases is already put the

485
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:22,010
crease and that is a honestly really

486
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,630
question that I still at 100% not sure

487
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:26,900
the answer to if you grab the end of

488
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:28,760
your brush and lightly lightly poke

489
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:31,460
around your eye area you should actually

490
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:33,080
be able to feel your crease it is the

491
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:35,870
kind of squishy area that you can push

492
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:37,730
in right here right in between your brow

493
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:39,620
bone which you obviously can't push in

494
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:40,910
and your eyeball which you shouldn't

495
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:43,040
push in because I'm not trying to get

496
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:44,450
sued if you go blind tain once again my

497
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,550
full coverage concealer I'm gonna put a

498
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:48,950
dollop of it on the back of my hand and

499
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:50,630
I'm gonna grab a Miami two to four brush

500
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:52,610
which is that flat concealer brush that

501
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:54,290
I was telling you guys about I freaking

502
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:55,910
love this you can use this for concealer

503
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:57,650
or packing a shadow onto the lid or

504
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:59,420
glitter you just need one of these in

505
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:01,700
your collection I'm gonna dip it right

506
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:03,110
into that concealer and before actually

507
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:05,270
going into the eye I'm going to lightly

508
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:06,620
dab off any excess because the last

509
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:08,180
thing you want is to place it on there

510
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:10,880
and get a clump and mess everything up

511
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:12,350
it's happened to me don't do it

512
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,170
once you're all ready to go I'm gonna

513
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:17,390
tilt my head up and backwards so I can

514
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:19,040
look into the mirror and have all of my

515
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:21,110
eyelid a pletely accessible and there

516
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,750
are no wrinkles I'm gonna place my brush

517
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:29,000
right in there and I'm just going to

518
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:29,990
follow the shape of my crease once we're

519
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,240
happy with the shape and the concealer

520
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:34,220
is all tacky I'm gonna quickly grab my

521
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,500
Emma to a fire brush or just any tiny

522
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:38,270
packing a brush and go right back into

523
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,710
the shadow and I'm going to do the

524
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:41,150
eyelid I'm bursting they're gonna be

525
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:42,410
white in the top corner and I'm gonna

526
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:44,240
pack this right on at the inner corner

527
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:45,950
of the eye then with that same exact

528
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,290
brush grabbing the yellow and packing

529
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:50,540
that right next door do not necessarily

530
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:52,220
worry about the blending either by

531
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:53,270
tapping into the colors that Cleo though

532
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,220
they're gonna kind of blend naturally

533
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:57,860
and since the concealer is wet you have

534
00:16:55,220 --> 00:17:00,680
to work fast then grabbing the orange

535
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:03,140
then the red and then finally the purple

536
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:04,459
connecting it right into that outer V as

537
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,660
you guys can see even while packing

538
00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:07,610
these shades on there I still have my

539
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:10,190
head tilted backwards which might look

540
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:11,870
crazy but I promise you this makes it so

541
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:13,610
much easier to get full access to your

542
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:15,140
eyelid and make sure that you don't get

543
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:17,000
any shadow where you don't want it to be

544
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:18,680
and you get it right up to that crease

545
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,240
line similar to up here how we kept

546
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,560
going back in with each individual color

547
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,880
after the fact to make sure it was

548
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,320
blended I'm gonna do the same exact

549
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,390
thing so I'm going to go back into my

550
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:27,670
red and top

551
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:30,250
right over that transition area then the

552
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:31,630
orange before I do the yellow I do want

553
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,860
to add a little bit of a metallic shade

554
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:35,530
on the inner corner just for a little

555
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:37,240
pop of shimmer and for this I'm gonna

556
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:40,210
use the Tarte chrome paint in the shade

557
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,680
of top yacht I love this one I just

558
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:43,780
under grab a tiny little brush and I'm

559
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,980
going to get it right on there and the

560
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:47,140
one tip I have for you guys when it

561
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:50,080
comes to it metallic shadows is to give

562
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:52,300
your brush a good spritz a fix plus or

563
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,400
any setting spray and then it on

564
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:56,110
and it's gonna really make it shine now

565
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,780
I'm gonna go back into the yellow and go

566
00:17:56,110 --> 00:18:00,700
right over the edge of the two of those

567
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:02,770
colors and you guys that is the upper

568
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:04,540
shadow I'll complete see not that that

569
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:05,770
when you really break it down we're

570
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:07,990
gonna take a break from shout out for a

571
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:09,640
second and move on to the winged liner

572
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:11,260
probably right behind a cut crease a

573
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,940
good a winged liner is probably one of

574
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:14,470
the hardest techniques to do and makeup

575
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,790
but I'm gonna show you guys a few tips

576
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:17,740
and tricks to really get your wings

577
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:19,930
snatched ready to cut someone and

578
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:21,160
hopefully very even there are many

579
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:22,600
different products in the makeup world

580
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,140
that you can use to create a winged

581
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,600
liner

582
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:27,400
some people like a pencil I do not some

583
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,190
people like a gel liner with a brush I

584
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:33,790
do not some people like a liquid liner

585
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:36,280
with like bristles I sometimes do but

586
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:38,650
really did not what I really like to use

587
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:40,600
is a felt tip liner for today I'm going

588
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:42,280
to use the Marc Jacobs felt tip liner

589
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,920
just like this and it's basically a tiny

590
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:46,810
little marker this one is $58 which you

591
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:48,220
definitely do not have to buy I get that

592
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:49,960
as ridiculously expensive

593
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:52,030
I know Maybelline has a literally good

594
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,710
and so does Kat Von D but basically

595
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:55,120
you're gonna want to use a felt tip

596
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:57,070
liner if you are like me and you

597
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,440
struggle with this because it makes it

598
00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:00,820
so much easier the most common question

599
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,830
I get when it comes to winged liner is

600
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:04,300
how do you get them to be even let's be

601
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:06,280
real we all have days where our

602
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:08,350
eyeliners are like not even distant

603
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,130
cousins let alone sisters let alone

604
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:11,410
twins

605
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:12,430
but there is one half that I have for

606
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:14,290
you guys that's really gonna hopefully

607
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:16,780
step up your eyeliner game and that is

608
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:18,550
follow the shape of your eyes when

609
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:20,110
drawing in the bottom line of your way

610
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:22,300
you're gonna want to imagine as if your

611
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:23,620
waterline and continued so as you can

612
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,780
see here my winder line goes all the way

613
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:27,550
around goes up and then my winged

614
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:29,890
eyeliner looks like it's a continuation

615
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:32,170
and it follows that same exact shape and

616
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:34,420
is a slight angle upwards which gives my

617
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:36,400
eyes a nice left a lot of people tend to

618
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:37,870
draw their wings straight out which

619
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,420
done correctly can give a really cool

620
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:42,160
editorial look but often times on

621
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:45,490
certain shapes it tends to make the eyes

622
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:47,950
droop and look saggy for some reason a

623
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:49,690
lot of people tend to draw their wings

624
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:52,390
straight up which is literally

625
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:55,090
flattering on nobodies my shape unless

626
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:56,260
your eyes are literal like circles where

627
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:58,600
the liner would make sense to keep

628
00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:00,340
following the shape please to not draw

629
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,120
your eyeliner straight up it does not

630
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,530
belong there

631
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,120
taking my eyeliner pen and giving it a

632
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:06,190
good shake make sure that there's a lot

633
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,750
of product in the bristles I'm going to

634
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:09,430
go towards the corner of my eye and I'm

635
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:11,020
going to kind of rest my elbow on my

636
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:12,730
chest to make sure my arm is not going

637
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:14,500
anywhere and I'm going to start right at

638
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:18,490
the outer corner and I'm gonna draw a

639
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:20,410
line upwards following the shape of my

640
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:21,820
waterline similar to the brows if it's

641
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:23,230
messy it's okay because we're gonna

642
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:25,120
clean it up after once I have that

643
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:27,190
bottom line sketch in it we are golden

644
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,260
we're good to go I'm just gonna take it

645
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:32,440
and I'm going to drag the line right

646
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:33,970
back down to the lashes once the wing is

647
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:36,280
in place all you have to do is lightly

648
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:38,920
place that felt tip right on the base of

649
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:41,560
your lashes and just lightly drag all

650
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:43,750
the way across to finish off that winged

651
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:45,550
liner with a general rule keeping in

652
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:47,200
mind that it should start off a super

653
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:49,390
super thin in the inner corner and get

654
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,460
thicker as it gets to this portion and

655
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:52,780
then of course thin out of the weight

656
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:54,190
once we're happy with the overall shape

657
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:56,440
of the wing following the theme of this

658
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:57,760
video now we get to clean it up I'm

659
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,040
gonna grab my flat top concealer brush

660
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,720
once again a little bit more shaped tape

661
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:05,320
concealer and I'm just going to

662
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:06,940
carefully go right below the wing and

663
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,440
carve it out I'm also gonna take the

664
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:10,030
excess concealer on the brush and blend

665
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:12,280
it downwards overtop of some of this

666
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:13,570
eyeshadow that ended up back here

667
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,160
you don't need to do this it's just

668
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:18,580
personal preference that I really like a

669
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:20,920
cut and clean line when it comes to my

670
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:21,970
eye shadow looks of this kind of style

671
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,860
the hard part is over

672
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:25,120
thank God jumping back into the shadow

673
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:26,440
quickly to finish off the lower lash

674
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,120
line we're just gonna replicate the same

675
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,680
exact colors that we did on the top on

676
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,690
the bottom grabbing a little smudger

677
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:33,580
brush this is the Emma 213 and the dark

678
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:36,700
purple shade I'm just gonna press this

679
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:38,020
right up against the waterline and then

680
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,160
making sure to lightly drag out and

681
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:41,410
connect it with that wing because

682
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,640
nothing it looks weirder than when you

683
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:45,580
have shadow blended out and there's just

684
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:47,020
like a harsh divide right here don't do

685
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,990
that I'm gonna grab that pencil brush I

686
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:50,570
was talking about and dip

687
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:52,640
into the red shadow and he's it to blend

688
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:53,750
out that purple and finally just gonna

689
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,010
give an emperor three three and two

690
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:57,580
potential a little bit of orange and a

691
00:21:55,010 --> 00:22:00,380
little bit of yellow and just blend

692
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:02,030
right now the last and final step before

693
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:04,100
moving on to the lashes is going to be

694
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:06,320
water lines and if you guys are a true

695
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:08,900
sister you would know that I literally

696
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,760
hate them doing my waterline is by far

697
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:13,160
my least favorite stabbed and eye makeup

698
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:15,410
routine I hate it I have never liked it

699
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:17,059
and if you have sensitive or watery eyes

700
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:19,880
like me you might as well just skip it

701
00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:21,800
altogether it has truly saved the life

702
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,660
of my makeup routine I have never once

703
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,490
wore a black eyeliner and my upper

704
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:28,550
waterline and not have it be

705
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:30,410
ridiculously uncomfortable and transfer

706
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:33,050
to my lower lash line by the end of the

707
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:35,000
night so just skip it most helpful

708
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:37,460
makeup tip you'll ever receive as for

709
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,960
the lower waterline though gal I love

710
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:41,540
her there are so many things you can put

711
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,640
on there a pop color for a fun look my

712
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:45,440
Priscilla favorite is a nude liner this

713
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:47,570
one is from pretty vulgar and I just

714
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,280
love this using a nude liner in your

715
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:51,590
waterline is gonna really open up your

716
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,960
eyes make them pop and make them look

717
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:55,910
bigger you guys know I love a good doll

718
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:57,740
like makeup look and I really really

719
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:59,929
love the new it aforethought as you can

720
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:01,610
see it just looks so nice you can of

721
00:22:59,929 --> 00:23:04,040
course use a black liner as well for a

722
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:05,420
more sultry sexy look but just keep in

723
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,940
mind using a black is gonna make your

724
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:09,380
eyes appear smaller so line your

725
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:12,470
waterline accordingly

726
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:15,620
and last but finally certainly not least

727
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:17,059
is going to be the lashes the first step

728
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:18,710
of applying lashes is always to give

729
00:23:17,059 --> 00:23:20,630
them a good curl using whatever color

730
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:22,460
you want I think this one was like $2

731
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:23,570
from CVS and the only tip I have for

732
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:25,940
this one is make sure you're getting

733
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:29,090
right up to the root of the lash right

734
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:30,710
your lash liner for the best curl our

735
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:32,540
next step of course is gonna be a good

736
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:33,950
coat of mascara and for today's video I

737
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:35,960
am so excited to be partnering with NYX

738
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:38,900

739
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:40,460

740
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:42,950
launched a few weeks ago is available

741
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:46,550

00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:47,809
eight dollars hello and is so good you

743
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,640
guys know I don't really do a whole lot

744
00:23:47,809 --> 00:23:51,200
of sponsored videos on this channel it

745
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,610
is pretty rare for me but I've been

746
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,130
testing this mascara out for the past

747
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:56,660
week or so and I really really like it

748
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:58,370
and I'm so excited to show you it today

749
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:00,080
going into the wand once again I'm gonna

750
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,770
tell my headed back so I have a really

751
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,540
easy access

752
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:04,550
my lashes I'm gonna start by bringing

753
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:06,710
this one in starting right at the root

754
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:09,740
of the lash almost in my upper waterline

755
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:11,840
and just wiggling it upwards going from

756
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:13,670
root to tip of the lash and wiggling

757
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,170
your wand all around you will also make

758
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:18,290
sure that all of ours are evenly coated

759
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:20,000
which is obviously ideal and as long and

760
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,200
beautiful as they can possibly be I

761
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,700
really really like this mascara because

762
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,590
it's of a luminizing mascara and

763
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:26,120
obviously who doesn't love a little bit

764
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:27,710
more volume a little bit more dimension

765
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,630
and their lashes I love a good

766
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:30,830
voluminous mascara but often times it'll

767
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:32,860
leave my lashes looking really really

768
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:35,390
clumpy but as you can see if I look down

769
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:37,610
they look nice and separated and so

770
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:39,110
beautiful and also the front of this is

771
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:40,550
really really black which is literally

772
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:42,590
the best ever

773
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:44,990
oh look at how good my bottom lashes

774
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:46,010
look oh my god NYX thank you for

775
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:48,590
partnering with you on this video and

776
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:50,630
sisters do you know what to do go check

777
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:51,800
it out it's worth the hype okay so if

778
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:53,420
you guys are looking for an everyday at

779
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:55,370
natural look when it comes to your

780
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:56,960
lashes at least you could totally stop

781
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:58,730
right here with just a good curl and

782
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,650
mascara and looks beautiful and stunning

783
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:02,000
but if you're like me and you want a

784
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:03,710
little bit more drama a little bit of a

785
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,810
bigger impact today we're gonna do some

786
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:07,430
falsies for today's look I'm gonna go in

787
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:08,840
you guessed it the Lily lashes in the

788
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:10,550
style of Miami these are my all-time

789
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,690
favorite false lashes and I really

790
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:14,120
really like them because they're super

791
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:15,560
super wispy they're not too dense so you

792
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:17,810
can still see the eye shadow underneath

793
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:19,490
and they're also not too long for my

794
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:21,560
eyes it's really important to keep your

795
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:23,300
actual eye shape and the shape of eyes

796
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,890
shadow that you're planning for in mind

797
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:26,510
when picking out a pair of lashes

798
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:27,950
obviously there are millions of

799
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:29,630
different styles of lashes out there but

800
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:31,550
I like to group them into two different

801
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:33,920
categories which I like to call either

802
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:35,720
symmetrical lashes or asymmetrical

803
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:39,020
lashes Lily lashes miami's are

804
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:41,060
symmetrical lashes in my book because at

805
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:43,700
the longest point they are all the same

806
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:45,350
exact length an asymmetrical ma should

807
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:47,600
be a lash that is small on the inner

808
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:50,030
corner but the lashes get longer and

809
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,830
longer and longer as they go out towards

810
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:53,870
the outer portion of your eye and they

811
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:55,670
flare up I definitely prefer wearing

812
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:57,500
asymmetrical last because I feel like it

813
00:25:55,670 --> 00:26:00,020
gives a very very doll-like appearance

814
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:02,090
it makes your eyes look very very round

815
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:04,100
whereas an asymmetrical lash really

816
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:05,960
accentuates almond eyes and makes them

817
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:07,970
kind of look more like snatched and

818
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:09,830
pulled which is also a really beautiful

819
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:11,600
look as well it just depends on what

820
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:12,500
kind of look you're going for once you

821
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,940
have your lashes all picked

822
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,710
and ready to go I'm gonna grab a pair of

823
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:17,660
tweezers and I'm going to pull them out

824
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:19,790
of the package very very carefully

825
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:20,780
most lashes are pretty expensive so

826
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:21,860
you're gonna want to be gentle and

827
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:23,120
pulling them out of the package because

828
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:24,620
the last thing that you want to do is

829
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,390
spend thirty dollars on a pair of lashes

830
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:29,990
and then rip out half the hairs each

831
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:32,300
hair is like 50 cents in here now the

832
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:34,130
absolute biggest mistake that people

833
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:36,500
make when putting on a pair of falsies

834
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:39,740
is taking them right out of the box and

835
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:41,570
popping them right on the eye please do

836
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:43,700
not do that if your lashes are poking

837
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:45,560
you if they are tickling you if they are

838
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:47,390
flying off in the inner corner it is

839
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:49,190
because you have an eyelash glued on

840
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:52,220
where there should not be an eyelash

841
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:54,590
glued on nobody has big enough eyes to

842
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:57,590
ever glue on this big of an eyelash to

843
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:59,720
your eye trim your eyelashes and your

844
00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:02,000
application and your entire life will be

845
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,470
a million times better the best way to

846
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,850
figure out how to trim your eyelashes

847
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:06,680
and what length is going to work best

848
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:08,750
for your eye shape is to take them out

849
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:11,030
of the box and put them on your eye but

850
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:12,710
without any glue the tackiness from

851
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:14,960
whatever was sticking at the lash to the

852
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:17,090
box should be enough to keep the lash on

853
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,980
your eyelid and kind of get a sense for

854
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:20,900
the measurement grab my lashes in the

855
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:22,550
center tightly by a pair of tweezers I'm

856
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:24,680
gonna grab my tiny pair of eyelash

857
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:26,690
scissors and I'm going to trim off the

858
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:30,500
ends for me personally I like to trim

859
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:32,030
off one spike on one and two spikes on

860
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,440
the other end which deathly made a huge

861
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:35,810
difference in the size and although this

862
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,400
may look small the other lashes that we

863
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:39,560
put mascara on are gonna do a great job

864
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:41,180
of blending together the false lash with

865
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:42,710
the real one and this is gonna look a

866
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:44,960
whole lot better than that

867
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:46,010
overwhelming lash from before to final

868
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,160
lashes today I'm going to be using the

869
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:52,070
duo brush on adhesive I love this lash

870
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:53,510
glue this stuff is so bob you need it in

871
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:55,940
your life I'm just gonna go ahead and

872
00:27:53,510 --> 00:28:00,560
open it up and paint a light layer of

873
00:27:55,940 --> 00:28:02,360
glue right on the lash band this glue

874
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:04,430
dries pretty quickly and it goes on blue

875
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:06,050
so once it turns clear you know it's

876
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:07,610
ready to apply so I'm just gonna shake

877
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:09,470
it around a little bit and I'm gonna

878
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:11,420
hold a mirror and just like this one

879
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:13,700
kind of below my face at a very very

880
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:16,400
weird angle trust me on this I'm gonna

881
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:18,890
look in my mirror from below me and I'm

882
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:20,880
gonna place the lash on top of my lid

883
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:22,800
from an upward

884
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,660
angle I'm gonna go to my tweezers and

885
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,700
then just pull on both ends and make

886
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:28,530
sure that the actual lash band is in

887
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:29,790
contact with my lash line

888
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:31,110
that's why holding the mirror from below

889
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:32,910
is super super helpful because you can

890
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:34,680
actually see what you're doing is that

891
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:36,060
I'm just trying to estimate it once our

892
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,620
last band is all glued on there we have

893
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:40,650
our last step but probably our most

894
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:42,540
important step and please be careful

895
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:45,450
while doing this do not poke your eyes

896
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:47,700
out go in super close up to your eyelid

897
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:50,190
with your pair of tweezers and go in and

898
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:53,400
pinch together right up against your

899
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:55,740
lash line the false lashes with your

900
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:57,930
real lashes and doing this is not only

901
00:28:55,740 --> 00:29:00,420
gonna make the lashes blend together and

902
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:02,730
look more real but because the mascara

903
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:04,920
is slightly tacky still it's gonna

904
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:06,510
really stick the lashes together so

905
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:09,090

with literally just grab a pair of

00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:30,450
falsies from like CVS or Walgreens and

917
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:32,310
just sit in front of your mirror and

918
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:33,870
practice gluing them on with no other

919
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:35,970
