mixture of the laura mercier okay making

73
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,370

75
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:27,150
Blender and push those creases up and

76
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:28,590
try not to be too hard as opposed to my

77
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:37,170
favorite makeup tricks that I have ever

78
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:40,190
learned today and truly likes bridge Oh

79
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:46,950
get the mac fix+

80
00:03:40,190 --> 00:04:17,460
drop and pick up the fan we're gonna

81
00:03:46,950 --> 00:04:22,110
spray myself with this morphe m45 brush

82
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:25,050
and i too many steps i came and found

83
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:25,650
the brush the m-52 7 brush but I guess

84
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:27,360
that works

85
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:29,550
contour my cheekbones or something like

86
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,010
that or bronze my cheekbones i think

87
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:34,530
it's called i'm using the morphe m 405

88
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:36,180
brush use KO james for 10% off we're

89
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:38,280
also gonna be using the Anastasia

90
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:40,020
Beverly Hills contour kit the light to

91
00:04:38,280 --> 00:05:02,430
medium I'm gonna grab the palette I'm

92
00:04:40,020 --> 00:05:04,810
gonna dip it into this I will do two

93
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,889
lines on top of my nose

94
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:07,660
if you're someone like me you're trying

95
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:09,940
to kind of fool beyond your nose looks a

96
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:11,770
lot smaller you definitely do not want

97
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:14,380
to follow your non sono save in the

98
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:21,430
situation and the contours where you

99
00:05:14,380 --> 00:06:15,010
wish your nose all right we're gonna

100
00:05:21,430 --> 00:06:17,020
move on so I just really like to kind of

101
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:18,700
reinforce that later on while the face

102
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:21,760
is still really really fresh and kind of

103
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:23,910
do it because it does everything we knew

104
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:26,020
the nose hollow because if you put the

105
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:28,510
completely from the effect of the pitch

106
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:30,310
smells but if you put it just on these

107
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:32,020
honeys tip of the nose range or right in

108
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:33,610
between those two contour lines it's

109
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,720
really gonna further afield lose it and

110
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:37,210
make it look like her that was spread

111
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,460
just literally like wow moving on

112
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:42,940
better saw her face we went to a lightly

113
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:44,590
baked earth base but make on face man

114
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:48,400
once again using my camp you under and

115
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:50,620
dipping into them right on the sides of

116
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,690
my nose to enforce the highlights which

117
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:55,510
once again further the illusion of a

118
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:57,699
pinched and snatched nose and when I

119
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:59,169
wipe this mall in a little while it's

120
00:06:57,699 --> 00:07:01,479
gonna kind of brighten up that entire

121
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:02,620
area and just clean up the contour what

122
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:04,780
just makes it look a little bit more

123
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:07,180
defined it a little bit more copped it

124
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:08,979
fetched I got a white beer to grow and

125
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:13,260
meet only being sixty and I could really

126
00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:13,260
grow a full beard so kind

127
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:24,090

128
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:32,460

130
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:36,930
pencil vertically into my face and I'm

131
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:39,690
gonna use a very very light pressure and

132
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:41,520
just lightly place my pencil I just kind

133
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:44,880
of flick it upwards to create

134
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,289
natural-looking hair strokes all right I

135
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,210
think this eyebrow looks okay I'm gonna

136
00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:49,820

00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:07,650
trust myself with a pair of scissors

173
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:09,330
where I did James's makeup he said I put

174
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:11,130
his lashes on perfectly but I'm not too

180
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:32,090
