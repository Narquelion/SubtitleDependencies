today's YouTube video I am absolutely

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,240
terrified because we are doing a

5
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,460
reaction video what you don't do very

6
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,410
often but it's what we're reacting to

7
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,630
and that I'm scared about and that is my

8
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,830
drunk makeup video by the time this

9
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,449

filming this I have not only not seen it

16
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,960
yet but I also literally remember

17
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:40,860
nothing from the night that we filmed it

18
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:43,079
because I completely blocked to sit down

19
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,390
watch it for the first time and react to

20
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,520
myself getting drunk also for the first

21
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,660
time my friends that unfortunately had

22
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,649
to be with me during the night a film

23
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:53,550
that you're all sitting in the room

24
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:55,379
ready to react to much as well but we

25
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,750
also have a very special guest to

26
00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:00,270
today's video they're supposed to come

27
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,699
in what am I looking at the camera to

28
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:05,129
cover the camera okay my sister Christie

29
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:06,650
B is currently in town and are you

30
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:09,990
excited to react to this video today

31
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:12,659
yeah I am really worried because I've

32
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:14,100
never seen you know you were dying to

33
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:17,790
Barnaby to get drunk for a very long

34
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:20,549
time not drunk yeah no I just wanted to

35
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:22,920
to you drinks and yes you're very

36
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:24,630
intense and everybody knows so being in

37
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,900
here to drink you would just relax a

38
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:30,280
little bit and see if you relaxed no

39
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:33,499

[Music]

42
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:47,299
just to clarify as well okay so I filled

43
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:49,609
the intro to this video completely sober

44
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:51,890
and then we went downstairs took a shot

45
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:53,359
or fine and then came back up to start

46
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:54,619
filming the video because I wanted to be

47
00:01:53,359 --> 00:02:23,030
a little bit tipsy what we first started

48
00:01:54,619 --> 00:02:24,349
but it didn't kick in quite a while know

49
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:26,180
that look that was looser

50
00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:28,190
that's the teaser for what's wrong hi

51
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:30,109
sisters James Charles here and welcome

52
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:31,310
back to my youtube channel if you can

53
00:02:30,109 --> 00:02:32,810
describe me for a while on my social

54
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:34,700
media platforms you've heard me talk

55
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:36,470
openly about the fact that I do not

56
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,030
drink alcohol it's just not really my

57
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,959
thing I never went to parties in high

58
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:41,420
school and I've just never really

59
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,790
thought they need to but that being said

60
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:46,220

61
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:48,019
I never went to a party I know all the

62
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:49,579

00:02:49,579 --> 00:02:55,519
about where I was no I always knew that

65
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:56,870

66
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,150

thought it was going to be but

107
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,269
