00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
hi sisters James Charles here and

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:04,560
welcome back my youtube channel first

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,700
today's video I am very very excited

4
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,550
because we're doing something a little

5
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,840
bit different for me at least obviously

6
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,550
you guys know I don't really do reviews

7
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,900
that often on this YouTube channel I'm

8
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,190
definitely a person that six are the

9
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,920
same makeup products in every single

10
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,990
video I mean if it ain't broke don't fix

11
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,220
it every once in a while I make our

12
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:21,600
brand and the industry will come with a

13
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,010
product that is very very exciting that

14
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,779
everyone cannot stop talking about and

15
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,460
that is what happened today because of

16
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:28,710
my favorite brands of all time Anasazi

17
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,170
at Beverly Hills just launched their

18
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:33,719
brand new at foundation and they're

19
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,430
setting powder duo that get effect

20
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:38,239
that's a little scary

21
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:41,250
3 James is who Kimberly have a bill on

22
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:43,710
let's be real okay and it's no secret

23
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,059
that for me foundation is a little bit

24
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,500
of a sore subject when it comes to a

25
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:47,940
makeup routine like we've had some great

26
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,520
moments we've also had some really

27
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,840
really awful embarrassing moments I'm

28
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,190
not afraid to admit that I'm definitely

29
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,110
not a foundation export in any way shape

30
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:57,239
or form I struggle quite a lot with it

31
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:58,859
honestly but at this point I have tried

32
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:00,690
quite a lot of different foundations to

33
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:02,010
modify like my perfect foundation that

34
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,270
works for me so whenever a new

35
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,629
foundation comes out that I'm excited

36
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,040
about

37
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:06,659
I definitely always want to try it out

38
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,369
and for today's video that is exactly

39
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:09,630
what we're going to do Auto sauce they

40
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:11,070
sent over their entire shade range of

41
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,780
the foundations and their loose powders

42
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,070
and we're gonna test it out I have some

43
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,840
at meetings I have some phone calls and

44
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:17,310
I also have a photo shoot today so we're

45
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,920
doing a full we're test giving you guys

46
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,400
the healthy I'm brand new bodice Asya

47
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:27,520
Beverly Hills foundation

48
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:29,540
[Music]

49
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,040
all right you guys let's just jump right

50
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,060
into this review I'm so excited if

51
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,350
everything that I have to do today

52
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,820
actually this will be really good at

53
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:36,350
where test as well because it will be

54
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,640
wearing it all day long and also through

55
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:39,500
a photo shoot so we'll get to see how it

56
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,910
really photographs in front of super

57
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,010
high definition cameras which could be

58
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:44,840
very very scary or it could look really

59
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:46,490
really bomb Anasazi sent over these PR

60
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,070
packages super early this morning and if

61
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:50,390
you open it up here's what's inside if I

62
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,590
pull one of the shades out of the pr box

63
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,150
this is actually what the packaging

64
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:55,070
component looks like it is just a super

65
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:56,780
simple glass rectangular bottle which I

66
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:58,190
really really like I'm says Anasazi

67
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,750
Beverly Hills luminous foundation on

68
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:02,090
this side and on the other side it says

69
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:03,470
Foundation and really huge black letters

70
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:05,119
and when I first saw this I'm not gonna

71
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:06,229
lie if something did it like it it's

72
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,490
just something that I'm definitely never

73
00:02:06,229 --> 00:02:10,010
seen before and when I thought at first

74
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:11,330
I was a little bit taken aback but I do

75
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:12,740
follow more Vita on Twitter who is the

76
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:14,750
president of Anastacio and as somebody

77
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:16,160
asked her about it and she said that

78
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,480
it's actually for a makeup artist

79
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,830
because when you pack everything in a

80
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,660
kit it can be really really hard to kind

81
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:22,190
of distinguish everything so if it's

82
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,480
labeled you know exactly what you're

83
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:25,160
grabbing for you kind of think that

84
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,840
that's located very very smart and

85
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:29,390
straight to the point now in each bottle

86
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,739
I believe there is yep one fluid ounce

87
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:32,150
of product which is definitely the

88
00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:33,830
universal standard when it comes to at

89
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:35,989
foundations at this point and this will

90
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:38,510
be retailing for $38 which i think is

91
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:42,200
also like kind of the standard - I think

92
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:44,900
the 21 is $35 the two days for this way

93
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:46,850
that I always use is 38 I think the

94
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:48,320
Urban Decay one is 40 of all those

95
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:49,430
prices are right in my head for some

96
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,480
reason so it definitely is like an

97
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:52,730
average price point in terms of the

98
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,900
other foundations of the top-tier brands

99
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:55,190
now in terms of shade into this

100
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:58,040
foundation that there are five different

101
00:02:55,190 --> 00:03:00,830
categories fair light medium tan and

102
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:03,019
deep and they come in a 50 different

103
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:04,580
shades which i think is so what's so

104
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:06,620
beyond incredible there's not a single

105
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:09,019
skip or gap in between there's a nice

106
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:10,820
beautiful ombre from super super pale to

107
00:03:09,019 --> 00:03:12,200
super super dark and everybody I'm sure

108
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:14,180
I can find a shade somewhere in here

109
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,310
hopefully we include it because you guys

110
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:17,660
know that I struggled quite a lot but I

111
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:18,530
think this is really really important so

112
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,400
many brands heard about the makeup

113
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:21,350
industry or coming out with that

114
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,209
foundation lines with like I super pale

115
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:24,860
white color and then a dark brown and

116
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:26,540
are like oh my God we're inclusive what

117
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,730
do you do but in reality there's like 12

118
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,230
shades and

119
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:30,550
undertones are all off all inclusivity

120
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:32,379
means that literally anybody can go to

121
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:33,790
the line and anybody can find their

122
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:35,260
color and I think that it's very very

123
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:36,280
important I'm not gonna swatch all 50

124
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,810
shades because I don't think that's

125
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,069
showcasing the deeper skin tones on my

126
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:41,230
skin tone is gonna help literally

127
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:42,700
anybody purchasing it duh but I do want

128
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:44,170
to give some quick love to Nima tang and

129
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,459
Alissa Ashley they have some of my

130
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:47,590
favorite foundation reviews for women of

131
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:48,879
color and also make up Tiffany J just

132
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,810
because I freaking love her and I've

133
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,099
been obsessed watching her videos

134
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:52,900
recently if you guys want to check out

135
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:54,610
their videos on this foundation I'm sure

136
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,690
they'll be up very very soon I wanna

137
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,340
quickly go over the claims before we

138
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:58,930
actually put the foundation on the

139
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:01,209
anasazi Beverly Hills luminous

140
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:02,890
foundation is water-resistant long

141
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:05,110
wearing with a medium coverage formula

142
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:07,030
okay it gives the complexion a fresh

143
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:09,819
already a lot with a lightweight second

144
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:11,980
skin feeling it is a no flashback

145
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:13,870
formula we will definitely be testing

146
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:15,549
that with our photo shoot later on today

147
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:17,139
it is suitable for all skin types

148
00:04:15,549 --> 00:04:18,400
including sensitive skin which you know

149
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:20,229
is very very important for a lot of your

150
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,180
sisters out there it is clinically

151
00:04:20,229 --> 00:04:23,860
tested dermatologist tested and the

152
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,539
formula is also cruelty free and vegan

153
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,550
lastly before we actually get into our

154
00:04:25,539 --> 00:04:29,410
makeup application I know this intro is

155
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:31,389
very very long at associate also

156
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:33,010
launched their brand new setting powders

157
00:04:31,389 --> 00:04:34,930
as well which I'm a very very powerful

158
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:36,430
and will be using in this video it comes

159
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,870
in at 5 at different change which i

160
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:39,250
think is actually really really cool we

161
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:41,620
have the shade of vanilla for light skin

162
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:44,680
tones we have banana for medium skin

163
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:47,680
tones we have deep peach for tan skin

164
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,780
tones we have golden orange or deep skin

165
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,160
tones

166
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,960
that we also have a translucent which is

167
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,340
the universal shade for everybody

168
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,289
wow that's some good balancing right

169
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:58,360
there look at the on associate setting

170
00:04:56,289 --> 00:05:00,490
powder is a lightweight silky powder

171
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,410
that sets makeup with a flawless matte

172
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:04,720
finish so hopefully there will be no

173
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:06,700
shine fingers crossed it delivers a long

174
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,229
wearing of that to the makeup okay we

175
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,520
will test that today and see hopefully

176
00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:10,900
it wants to do many touch-ups

177
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,389
it has clinically tested and also

178
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:15,940
cruelty-free and vegan and this setting

179
00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:17,770
powder will retail for $36 which is just

180
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,750
like Dee Foundation is very like average

181
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:20,289
pricing oh my god okay the intro is

182
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,729
finally done

183
00:05:20,289 --> 00:05:23,680
this is why I don't do reviews okay that

184
00:05:21,729 --> 00:05:24,970
was like three hours of me just talking

185
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,220
and stuttering and trying to say the

186
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:28,630
same thing over no too much information

187
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:30,940
this is why I just like to put on the

188
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:32,289
makeup and call it a day but I'm so

189
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:34,870
excited to actually get into this in

190
00:05:32,289 --> 00:05:36,099
China but now we have another challenge

191
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:39,450
but if we actually get into our makeup

192
00:05:36,099 --> 00:05:39,450
and that is color

193
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,990
this should be interesting

194
00:05:41,729 --> 00:05:45,029
okay so we have the two hundredths which

195
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:47,430
definite looks like it could be bad for

196
00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:49,409
me we had the three hundredths which is

197
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:51,029
too dark I feel like definitely we have

198
00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:53,009
the 100's which I feel like are two

199
00:05:51,029 --> 00:05:55,139
lights we have the five hundreds which

200
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:56,249
are definitely not right I'm gonna go

201
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:59,520
ahead and test some of the trades in the

202
00:05:56,249 --> 00:06:01,409
light category we have 160 200 210 220

203
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,710
and 240 and see if any of them are a

204
00:06:01,409 --> 00:06:06,149
good match for me let's try it 160 on my

205
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:08,849
hand it looks a little bit light on my

206
00:06:06,149 --> 00:06:11,069
face it looks a little bit light on my

207
00:06:08,849 --> 00:06:13,949
chest it looks a little bit too yellow

208
00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:16,589
let's try 200 W now my hand also looks

209
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:19,589
way too light on my face it looks too

210
00:06:16,589 --> 00:06:22,469
light and on my chest it looks not great

211
00:06:19,589 --> 00:06:23,460
let's try 2 10 neutral under told us a

212
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:24,899
little bit better but it still looks a

213
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:27,360
little bit too light on my hand on my

214
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:29,610
face it looks not anywhere close to

215
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,349
anything on my chest the undertone looks

216
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:33,689
definitely better but still no let's try

217
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:38,550
220 neutral let's go a little bit darker

218
00:06:33,689 --> 00:06:40,409
honestly yeah okay let's try 250 oh wow

219
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:43,099
that like blends in with my neck so well

220
00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:46,680
kind of ish maybe not

221
00:06:43,099 --> 00:06:49,430
I mixed together 250 and 220 let's see

222
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:52,379
how this looks that looks really good

223
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:54,330
that undertone looks really good yeah

224
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:55,469
okay we're going with that one okay out

225
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,659
of all the things that we try it I think

226
00:06:55,469 --> 00:06:59,129
I'm actually going to end up going with

227
00:06:56,659 --> 00:07:00,839
315 and neutral which is a lot darker

228
00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:02,009
than I thought it would be but as you

229
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:04,919
can see this color matches my hand

230
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:06,539
almost like exactly and once I blend and

231
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:08,699
weigh down on my neck it's gonna match

232
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:09,809
touch my body - like I said this process

233
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:11,879
is very very irritating and frustrating

234
00:07:09,809 --> 00:07:12,809
for me to deal with but you gotta do it

235
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:14,610
you gotta do I'm gonna stuff with just

236
00:07:12,809 --> 00:07:16,559
my touch out water cream to moisturize

237
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:18,899
my face before I go ahead and put on the

238
00:07:16,559 --> 00:07:20,729
foundation and then describing a tiny

239
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:22,620
little bit of the dragon Beauty color

240
00:07:20,729 --> 00:07:24,959
corrector just to cover over some beard

241
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:26,490
areas just like I normally do finally

242
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:28,229
let's go ahead and put this on I'm going

243
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:29,580
to spot my face in half and do a Beauty

244
00:07:28,229 --> 00:07:29,849
Blender on one side and a brush on the

245
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,379
other

246
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:33,180
both of these are from morphe which you

247
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:34,889
guys can use KO james for 10% off and

248
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:36,629
will see it which one it looks better

249
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:37,949
well that actually looks like a really

250
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:40,229
good color the foundation claims to be

251
00:07:37,949 --> 00:07:41,699
lightweight and medium coverage which i

252
00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:43,409
will say it is building up really really

253
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:45,330
nicely and it is covering over the color

254
00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:46,529
corrector which is obviously important

255
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:47,819
because we don't want orange

256
00:07:46,529 --> 00:07:50,099
shining through the points just to

257
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:51,569
cancel out those gray tones you

258
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:53,129
definitely can still see my freckles and

259
00:07:51,569 --> 00:07:55,439
a beauty marks to the foundation which I

260
00:07:53,129 --> 00:07:56,639
really really do like but it is doing a

261
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:58,319
great job with evening everything out

262
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,149
which is obviously the point of a medium

263
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,439
coverage okay it's definitely feeling

264
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:02,909
really really nice on the skin it does

265
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,229
not feel super heavy it just like it

266
00:08:02,909 --> 00:08:05,609
cleaned which is obviously it really

267
00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:06,689
really good and I feel like it did a

268
00:08:05,609 --> 00:08:08,819
good job of evening everything out

269
00:08:06,689 --> 00:08:10,649
covering everything it looks really

270
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:12,839
really Bob okay let's go ahead and try

271
00:08:10,649 --> 00:08:14,639
out the brush on the other side I've

272
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:16,079
honestly always just been so confused

273
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,489
and also jealous of people who are able

274
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:19,349
to use a foundation brush and like do

275
00:08:17,489 --> 00:08:21,029
their foundation no matter how much I

276
00:08:19,349 --> 00:08:22,709
blend it out I always feel like I need a

277
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:24,209
Beauty Blender to go and just like make

278
00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:25,679
everything look like perfect and get rid

279
00:08:24,209 --> 00:08:27,329
of brush strokes like is that just me

280
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:28,829
like am i literally crazy I'm definitely

281
00:08:27,329 --> 00:08:29,879
a Beauty Blender type of person no we

282
00:08:28,829 --> 00:08:31,679
just have to blown this down really

283
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:32,999
really far in here okay you guys so this

284
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:34,319
is how the audition looks on the scan at

285
00:08:32,999 --> 00:08:36,180
with a Beauty Blender on one side and a

286
00:08:34,319 --> 00:08:38,610
foundation brush on the other oh wow

287
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:41,039
okay we are close up and ready to go how

288
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:42,300
it looks really really pretty it

289
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,889
definitely is luminous just like it

290
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:46,079
claims but it doesn't look like gross

291
00:08:43,889 --> 00:08:48,329
oily I definitely will be setting this

292
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:50,279
down with a powder and a few minutes but

293
00:08:48,329 --> 00:08:51,720
this is off to a really really good

294
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:53,160
start I definitely do agree that it is

295
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,329
medium coverage even everything got

296
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,040
really nicely but you can still see my

297
00:08:54,329 --> 00:08:57,329
freckles popping through there is this

298
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,500
pimple popping through which is annoying

299
00:08:57,329 --> 00:09:00,689
me but I wonder if I add just a little

300
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,220
bit more if it like buildup oh yeah it

301
00:09:00,689 --> 00:09:04,920
does okay so it is definitely buildable

302
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:06,480
- this is good advice let's do a

303
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,009
concealer quickly for concealer that's

304
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,809
always I'm just gonna grab my shape tape

305
00:09:08,009 --> 00:09:10,559
and highlight the middle points of my

306
00:09:09,809 --> 00:09:11,490
face

307
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:13,259
all right you because that is everything

308
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:14,490
all blended out the concealer layer over

309
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:16,410
top of everything are really really

310
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:18,389
nicely at nothing weird at all and the

311
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:20,220
foundation is looking at so what's so

312
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:21,569
beautiful at this point but I do want to

313
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,949
go ahead and set it and please so we're

314
00:09:21,569 --> 00:09:24,660
gonna test out the brand-new Anastasio

315
00:09:22,949 --> 00:09:26,069
setting powders as well I'm gonna

316
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:28,139
prescribe this shade at vanilla because

317
00:09:26,069 --> 00:09:30,389
these can be used for brighten a I don't

318
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:32,220
know why that I love how big these jars

319
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:33,990
are it feels very luxurious I'm just

320
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,970
gonna dip in my beauty sponge into that

321
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,439
powder and pop this right underneath the

322
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,910
eye to do some nice bright at night

323
00:09:37,439 --> 00:09:40,230
wondering how brightening this actually

324
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:41,339
is that could've been a mistake could

325
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:43,670
also put this right in the middle of my

326
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:46,250
forehead

327
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:47,870
has not to always work its most Whaley

328
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:49,040
well that modified things really quickly

329
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:50,870
what Chrissy was kind of like in the

330
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,790
center of my face then it's gonna grab

331
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:54,020
the translucent shade and with a fluffy

332
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:55,760
brush that's gonna dip into this and

333
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:57,200
he's just too sad do you rest of my face

334
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,460
in place okay so they were not kidding

335
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,140
when they said that it would be very mad

336
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:02,210
wow I'm just gonna get myself a quick

337
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:03,740
spritz of the anastacio doing setting

338
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:05,570
spray just because this is the Luminess

339
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:07,760
of foundation and if i assume you guys n

340
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:09,500
this is what the foundation is looking

341
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,510
like now that is all set in place it is

342
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,760
setting on the scanner so nicely there's

343
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:15,290
no creasing at no fine lines no texture

344
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,220
this is good okay you guys so this is

345
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:18,080
pretty much the base routine all

346
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:20,750
complete and I will say right now I'm

347
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:22,340
really really liking how it looks but I

348
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,690
have a full face of makeup now to add on

349
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:25,400
to this but for my photo shoot which I'm

350
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:26,600
not running very very late for so I'm

351
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,860
going to go into that off camera quickly

352
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,180
I will check in with the finished look

353
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,290
and about an hour for now and then we

354
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,460
will continue checking in throughout the

355
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:33,380
day to see if it continues to look

356
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:35,180
really really good or this could turn

357
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,870
into a major fail later on we're going

358
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,950
to find out together

359
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:38,420
all right you guys of your gawk and this

360
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:39,680
is the finished look all complete this

361
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:41,150
is not a special look it is for the

362
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,250
photo shoot like I said obviously we're

363
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:45,230
focusing on the foundation and as of

364
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:47,030
right now I think it looks so what's so

365
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:48,830
beautiful it is currently 2:30 oh you

366
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:50,030
can't even see it it is currently 231

367
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:51,800
p.m. you're gonna have to trust me on

368
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:53,150
this one I started this video about two

369
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,650
hours ago now but I did have to take

370
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:56,540
about a 30 minute break for a phone call

371
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:58,040
meeting and through talking through the

372
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:59,750
entire thing I did not get any creases

373
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,430
the foundation still looks really really

374
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,690
beautiful I am getting a little bit of

375
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:04,610
shine right here in this area which I

376
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:05,630
don't love but it is a luminous

377
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:07,010
foundation which is a little bit

378
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:08,360
different for me so I'm going to go into

379
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:09,800
this open-minded and just hope that it

380
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,720
doesn't get really really bad later on

381
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,310
if it stays like this I'll be super

382
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,200
super happy okay guys and here's how it

383
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:16,420
looks in it natural lighting - honestly

384
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,330
you guys I think it looks

385
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:20,470
so it's so good I don't know jinx that

386
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:22,270
comes me believe it but a little how

387
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:33,670
about but it looks so Bob and the color

388
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:35,050
like guys let them out this is rare how

389
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:37,720
would you say my foundations looking so

390
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:39,670
far I'm doing a little review today okay

391
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:49,900
it looks really good it looks like a

392
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:51,130
good match okay so about four hours and

393
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:53,410
right now this is pretty good for four

394
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:57,970
hours yeah great

395
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:59,230
hello blog is coming 6:42 p.m. we just

396
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:00,490
finished our photo shoot and I was super

397
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:02,380
hungry because they realize I forgot to

398
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:03,580
eat today don't do that kids it's not

399
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:05,170
good for you I thought I'd be really

400
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:06,790
keen to just like take some photos with

401
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:07,780
my McFlurry and my french fries but I

402
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,950
wanted to do a quick little check in

403
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,360
because as I was looking through the

404
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:11,770
photos of her a little at McDonald's

405
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,960
parking lot photo shoot that we have

406
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:15,880
going on right now the first thing that

407
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:17,530
I noticed was my skin was looking really

408
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,090
really good and I'm very excited about

409
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:20,620
that the foundation has been on for

410
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:23,590
about seven hours by now it was also

411
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:26,290
okay about 105 degrees in California

412
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:28,180
today which was absolutely disgusting

413
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:30,010
I was literally sweating and deimos

414
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:31,390
during my photo shoot TMI start you

415
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:33,580
didn't know that but you do because it's

416
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:35,200
a foundation review I didn't do any

417
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,640
touch-ups but I did have to like blow

418
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,400
myself a tiny little bit with the napkin

419
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:42,970
earlier it's really hard being Instagram

420
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:44,740
model you but point being it still looks

421
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,730
really bomb we are seven hours in at the

422
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,480
foundation wear test it's going pretty

423
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:48,010
well

424
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,050
if I look in the mirror I'm not really

425
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:52,540
seeing any creases aside from just this

426
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:53,080
one in at my mouth region but I get that

427
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,480
all the time

428
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:57,220
my nose region is getting a little bit

429
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,420
oily if this happens literally every

430
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:01,180
foundation that I've ever worn it but

431
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:03,190
it's not bad so I really happy what do

432
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:05,200
you guys think you can't answer that

433
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:07,570
joke then you put over in the comments

434
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,769
Peter on let's get out of here this is a

435
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:19,059
vas

436
00:13:08,769 --> 00:13:21,220
Oh like hell are you kidding all right

437
00:13:19,059 --> 00:13:23,199
sisters we are finally back home after a

438
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:25,059
very very long a but super super

439
00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:26,559
productive day I cannot wait for you

440
00:13:25,059 --> 00:13:30,910
guys to see what we've been working on

441
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:32,649
it is currently 1108 p.m. at night that

442
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:34,119
is how p.m. maids oh my god

443
00:13:32,649 --> 00:13:36,069
I am beyond exhausted and this makeup

444
00:13:34,119 --> 00:13:37,689
has been on for 11 hours now and it's

445
00:13:36,069 --> 00:13:39,610
time to give you guys my final thoughts

446
00:13:37,689 --> 00:13:40,869
I am pretty sure you guys can guess one

447
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42,009
thing about this foundation since I

448
00:13:40,869 --> 00:13:43,720
definitely have made it really obvious

449
00:13:42,009 --> 00:13:44,589
to all the check-ins today but I do want

450
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,420
to give you guys just a quick little

451
00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:47,799
sister summary my skin definitely is

452
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,689
getting pretty oily in a few different

453
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:52,059
places it specifically at my nose region

454
00:13:49,689 --> 00:13:53,619
right here on like my under eye cheek

455
00:13:52,059 --> 00:13:54,850
type of region and then kind of above

456
00:13:53,619 --> 00:13:56,379
the brow bone in the center of the

457
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:57,579
forehead this is pretty typical for my

458
00:13:56,379 --> 00:13:58,779
skin no matter what foundation they're

459
00:13:57,579 --> 00:13:59,769
wearing especially if I don't do stop

460
00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:01,749
shops throughout the day which I

461
00:13:59,769 --> 00:14:02,860
normally do obviously for this review I

462
00:14:01,749 --> 00:14:05,230
did not so I could give you guys the

463
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:06,730
unfiltered result but concerned this is

464
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:08,319
a luminous foundation I really don't

465
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:09,879
think it looks bad at all I think this

466
00:14:08,319 --> 00:14:11,499
is exactly what the foundation claimed

467
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:12,839
to do and if I'm being honest I don't

468
00:14:11,499 --> 00:14:14,470
even think the oiliness looks not bad

469
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:15,610
personally I would definitely take a

470
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:17,559
little bit of powder and touch up this

471
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:18,819
face but I know a lot of people do

472
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:21,220
prefer a more dewy

473
00:14:18,819 --> 00:14:21,970
natural skin like type of finish so for

474
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,350
those of you guys I think this

475
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:24,879
foundation will be absolutely perfect

476
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:26,439
and this is definitely thing that I'll

477
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:28,269
be adding to my kit and using a lot more

478
00:14:26,439 --> 00:14:29,290
often all right you guys that I think

479
00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:30,730
that is pretty much everything that I

480
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:31,629
have for today is a brand new video I'm

481
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:33,040
trying to make sure that I didn't forget

482
00:14:31,629 --> 00:14:35,679

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,119
