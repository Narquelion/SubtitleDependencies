00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:00,390
like an everyday at glam makeup day and

24
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,850
Victor has no idea what any of this

25
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,880
stuff is so let's use all of this I mean

26
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,540
most of it I would use normally oh so

27
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,710
they feel like you just gonna be

28
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,790
throwing all these products on me and

29
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:14,100

30
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:15,540
can't you do it yeah I love the

31
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:19,770
enthusiasm okay if you want to see how

32
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:21,600
are you created I don't think you

33
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:23,220
brought everything I did know like I

34
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,189

whatever so this is please don't shoot

38
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:39,780
you can't just write whatever so this is

39
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,549

40
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:45,119
