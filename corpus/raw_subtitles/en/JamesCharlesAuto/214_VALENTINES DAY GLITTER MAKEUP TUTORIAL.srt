00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:07,220

00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:28,240
welcome back to my youtube channel so

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:30,710
[Music]

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,880
I've been so busy lately doing so many

8
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:33,230
different shoots and so many different

9
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,239
projects that I have barely had any time

10
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:36,380
to get a creative look done so today I

11
00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:37,610
really wanted to sit down and throw

12
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:39,590
something together that was cool and

13
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:41,900
conceptual it is the fish library which

14
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:43,250
means this month is Valentine's Day I'm

15
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,690
not excited it was my least here at

16
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,879
Holiday because I've been single for it

17
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:49,010
for 17 years now and let's be real it's

18
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,450

19
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:51,890

20
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,150
special day with anybody special and

21
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:55,220
I'll be staying at home I thought I

22
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:57,320
would do a more non wearable look so

23
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:59,000
today I created this super fun glittery

24
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,550
pink inspired

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,489
Valentine's Day look with hearts that's

26
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:05,509
cute I don't know what else to say if

27
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:06,950

28
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:08,869

using my benefit Porefessional primer as

31
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:14,600

00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,600

asking my it and pre prime my nose like

41
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:33,530
usual and it is still my favorite trick

42
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:34,729
but I lost my Mac concealer that is used

43
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:37,610
for it and I've been way too lazy to buy

44
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:39,020
any one so yeah as always I'm gonna use

45
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:42,640
my guitar shaped Eva concealer to

46
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,640
conceal and highlight my face

47
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:48,390

about 5 to 10 minutes and while that

64
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,250

88
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,880

34 but I just sorted playing a few days

100
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,700
ago so I think I'm doing it pretty well

101
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,170

102
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,220

download for free like I said I've

105
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:30,870
literally been playing non-stop so let's

106
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,610
see if you guys can beat my level

107
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:34,830
comment down below how far you are and

108
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:36,090
good luck sisters I may have got a

109
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,410
little bit distracted but at least I

110
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,610
beat the level but now that the bag is

111
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:40,290
all done I'm gonna go ahead and just

112
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:43,380
wipe it off so we can move on with the

113
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:44,519
rest of the face just hurt my brows

114
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,720
today I'm gonna use my benefit

115
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:48,590
processing my brow pencil in the shade

116
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,590
at number 6

117
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:57,799
I've been doing my brows a lot more like

118
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:59,989
light and fluffy lately with the pencil

119
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:02,750
as opposed to my usual Anasazi at depo

120
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:04,819
and honestly I'm kind of like loving it

121
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:06,859
so maybe we're saying goodbye to the

122
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:12,980
James Charles brick of an eyebrow

123
00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:14,510
r.i.p she will maybe be mixed with this

124
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:16,459
new style of brow that I've been loving

125
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:18,400
lately as I said I like to kind of fill

126
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:20,989
them in as least as possible and just

127
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,340
shape them and then I'll use the gel to

128
00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:24,680
kind of brush the hair upwards and then

129
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,820
fill in any gaps that I have just to

130
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:29,930
make them look really really light

131
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:31,099
fluffy and like natural and then just

132
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:32,960
setting my eyelid in place using my

133
00:04:31,099 --> 00:04:34,580
morphe e45 brush and some more

134
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,750
heart-shaped tape concealer and then

135
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:39,050
just going over with my translucent

136
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:40,639
powder so show off my eyes today I'm

137
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:42,530
going to be using my very very damaged

138
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:45,020
violet balls holy Vera shadow palette

139
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:46,789
I'm first gonna start off with my m4 4-1

140
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:50,020
dipping into a wine and dine and putting

141
00:04:46,789 --> 00:04:50,020
that in my crease as a transition color

142
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:54,650
I'm just putting this in my crease and

143
00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:56,000
circular motions and when I get to the

144
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:58,190
outer corner I'm also going to pull this

145
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,289
eyeshadow out and up in it like a

146
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:05,479
outward V wingy shape next I'm going to

147
00:05:03,289 --> 00:05:09,099
grab an m4 33 on the same shade wine and

148
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:09,099
dine and deepen up my crease and outer V

149
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:18,459
I'm also dragging whatever the excess

150
00:05:17,019 --> 00:05:19,749
product is on this brush into the lower

151
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:24,219
lash line because we're going to have a

152
00:05:19,749 --> 00:05:26,079
lot of stuff going on down here and then

153
00:05:24,219 --> 00:05:29,309
taking that m4 / one with no product on

154
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:29,309
it and just blending out those edges

155
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:43,070
I'm Mexican to grab the shade a teddy

156
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:45,790
bear on the same brush and deepen up

157
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,790
that outer corner

158
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:52,040
[Music]

159
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:58,300
Oxana take my 35 B and Miami 5/6 to it

160
00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:00,070
dip that into that black shade just to

161
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,330
define the very very outer part I'm

162
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:02,380
gonna be super gentle and light with

163
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:03,550
this to be careful that it doesn't get

164
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:05,410
too dark and messy

165
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:06,430
this look is taking a whole lot of

166
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:08,170
blending and for some reason my eye

167
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:10,270
shadow is not being a cooperative today

168
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:12,100
I mean are we really surprised will

169
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:13,090
there ever be a video with James Charles

170
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:15,790
where something doesn't go wrong

171
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:16,570
honestly it probably not clearly it's

172
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:18,070
not this one

173
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:20,770
to do a half cut crease today I'm going

174
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:21,730
to use my m17 0-0 and this oil pink

175
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:27,580
shade on my lid

176
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:29,830
I forgot my glitter glue at home classic

177
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:31,780
James so I just use my eyelash glue and

178
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:33,640
some craft store glitter both things

179
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:35,230
that are typically not safe and just did

180
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:37,240
this half cut crease I would not

181
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:38,650
recommend that strategy I would

182
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,330
definitely recommend using regular glue

183
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:42,490
and cosmetics great glitter but when

184
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:44,620
you're me sometimes things don't always

185
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:46,630
work out for the lower lash line I'm

186
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:48,370
going back in with my m4 for one and the

187
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:49,540
same shade wine and dine from the violet

188
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:56,650
Voss palette and I'm going to start to

189
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:58,060
blow out that bottom shadow I'm also

190
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:02,260
making sure to connect that pink up to

191
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:04,210
the upper lash line EXA going to grab

192
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:07,200
teddy bear on the m4 3/3 and deepen up

193
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:07,200
that outer corner

194
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:17,159
and then with a 562 and the black from

195
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,490
the 35 B I'm going to just hug the

196
00:07:17,159 --> 00:07:19,490
lashline

197
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,960
for the lower lash that I'm going to be

198
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:29,639
gluing on all sorts of different styles

199
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,680
of glitter I'm going to use this really

200
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:33,000
pink fine glitter [ __ ] litter that's a

201
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,380
little bit more chunky and then these

202
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,380
pink heart sequins

203
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:55,220
oh my god this is pretty I just wanna

204
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,690
have in line my upper and lower

205
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:58,610
waterline using my NYX jumbo eye pencil

206
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:59,990
in black bean to make the lashes blend

207
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:02,090
together then I'm just going to go to

208
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:03,590
Miami 213 in the black shape from the 35

209
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:05,170
B just make sure there's no skin showing

210
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:07,130
between the waterline and the lash line

211
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:08,720
alright guys and that is when I all

212
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,920
complete of course obviously at minus

213
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,210
the lashes I'm gonna do that the one

214
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,890
off-camera quickly to save some time

215
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:14,720
then we can finish up with the rest of

216
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:16,340
the face all right there we go that is

217
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,960
the finished eye look upper lashes today

218
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:24,830
I'm gonna pop on D Lily lashes in the

219
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:26,390
style of Janice okay so I just filmed a

220
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:28,550
video with Tana mojo and I found out

221
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:30,740
that apparently I'm like the only person

222
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:33,200
in human history that puts on mascara

223
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:34,670
then lashes so today I just did lashes

224
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,740
then I'm gonna put on mascara to blend

225
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:38,270
them together and that was the easiest

226
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,430
and eyelash has ever gone on to my eye

227
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:42,020
and now I'm very very angry that I did

228
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:43,100
not know this sooner even out of times

229
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,420
that I've been putting on a lash in the

230
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,400
lid I spent like 20 minutes sitting

231
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:50,630
there gluing it down a million times oh

232
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:53,330
wow I feel betrayed I feel lighter I

233
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:55,040
feel left out like I read all of my

234
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:56,480
comments and literally not a single one

235
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,220
of you who has ever commented saying Oh

236
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,930
James you should try to put on your

237
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:01,760
eyelash first and then do most secure

238
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:03,080
off her because it'll make your life a

239
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,120
million times easier instead of spending

240
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,460
17 years bring them on for once your

241
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,120
sisters have let me diamond life

242
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:09,560
highlighter today I'm gonna start off

243
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,360
with my Anasazi moonchild palette and

244
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,400
the shade pink heart using my morphe and

245
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,590
501 remember you can use code James for

246
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,940
10% off all morphe products and then I'm

247
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,900
gonna layer over top using my star

248
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,520
crushed minerals highlighter in the

249
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:22,490
shade rosy feature and you can use coda

250
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:23,750
James for 50% off all their products I'm

251
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:29,930
also gonna use the same highlighter to

252
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:31,100
highlight the tip of my nose for lips

253
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:34,360
today I could be using the open liquid

254
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,360
lipstick in the shade of the Kuna Beach

255
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:40,550
never mind okay I take it back okay

256
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,780
let's try this again I'm gonna use the

257
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:44,440
morphe liquid lipstick in the shade

258
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,440
now

259
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:51,060
I don't like this one either well last

260
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:54,410
time I'm gonna use Santa Anna from Oprah

261
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:54,410
hopefully this color will be yet

262
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:05,600
honestly whatever at this point I give

263
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:08,240
up I still hate this lip so I'm gonna

264
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,380
layer the shade Angeles on top at this

265
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:17,660
point I don't know where we're going

266
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:19,250
with this honestly just like giving up

267
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:24,980
but I think this is the best we're

268
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:26,540
probably gonna get today we're done I

269
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,800
just put on those two liquid lipsticks

270
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:29,630
then I added at the highlighter on top

271
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,320
from star-crossed minerals and a little

272
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,580
bit of glitter

273
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,320
nobody's gonna wear this look anyways

274
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:35,000
somewhere just go all out and be extra

275
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,830
and I'm gonna set this in place with my

276
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,870
all better settings right because after

277
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:44,660
all this I do not want this to come off

278
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:46,040
I think Urban Decay is sending a message

279
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:49,570
that they want this to come off because

280
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:51,890
I just ran out of a setting spray oh

281
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:53,480

282
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:55,130
