I say anything about this video at all I

8
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,460
first just want to say a major major

9
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:25,800
thank you this project since day one has

10
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,150
been such a dream of mine come true and

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,250
to actually put it out into the world

12
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,080
has been some of the most fun weeks of

13
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,550
my entire life and the fact that you

14
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,320
guys loved it and supported it as much

15
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:36,059
as you did literally means the entire

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,100
world I like at a loss for words

17
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:40,530
although season one has unfortunately

18
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,600
come to an end I feel like this is truly

19
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,460
the beginning of an amazing journey for

20
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,110
the past few weeks every Tuesday after

21
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,399
into influencer episodes we've been

22
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,289
uploading a YouTube video that somehow

23
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:50,789
correlates to the last week's challenge

24
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:52,410

00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:54,120

I cannot wait to learn more about that

109
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:27,569
see what makeup looks they bring to the

110
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:32,009
first day of shooting it that defines

111
00:06:27,569 --> 00:06:35,310
good morning and it's currently 626 in

112
00:06:32,009 --> 00:06:37,650
the morning and I have full glam side

113
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:39,120
without some for it is day one of

114
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:40,949
shooting and we're on the way to center

115
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,319
right now and so dark you can't even see

116
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:44,550
it's still dark outside left we were

117
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,770
pulling up to the YouTube faces right

118
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:48,629
now it is literally a barren wasteland

119
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:50,729
nobody see art as they should have been

120
00:06:48,629 --> 00:07:13,969
you should be sleeping right now so we

121
00:06:50,729 --> 00:07:13,969

122
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:29,389
[Music]

123
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:33,430
we're getting very close I'm getting

124
00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:44,720

okay so we just got our first official

131
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:01,099
cut it's going very very well it's very

132
00:07:58,669 --> 00:08:02,180
weird for me to like be so produce

133
00:08:01,099 --> 00:08:03,289
because we're so used to doing our

134
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,520
YouTube videos and having full control

135
00:08:03,289 --> 00:08:06,110
over everything that we saying

00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,099
everything the review and all the angles

137
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,900
and all the way to get what's happened

138
00:08:07,099 --> 00:08:13,580
it's like we kind of know what we're

139
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:15,710
gonna say just play something puffing

140
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:17,840
stuff but how do you like a four scrub

141
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:20,030
just like really really odd all the

142
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,710

143
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:23,690
I am it's so pleasantly surprised at all

144
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:25,840
Abed and I need to pee really badly and

145
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:28,280
think about who I think should win this

146
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:31,780
we're almost at the end of day one I'm

147
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,780
in my brand new customer

148
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:36,320
I don't know the nation that the

149
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:38,590
conditions have done there anything

150
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,590
together

151
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:46,370
merciless walking seems to do some

152
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:48,890
touching this is where it gets

153
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:51,890
interesting but before that I want to

154
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:55,820
introduce you but before that I want to

155
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:57,560
introduce my introduce but before that I

156
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:59,360
want to quickly introduce our guest

157
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,340
judges for you guys so we're about to

158
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,380
about day one we're on the final shot up

159
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:06,980
the dates and that man's revealing the

160
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:08,360
winner and loser obstinate episode I'm

161
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,860
really really nervous I'm excited to

162
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,050
tell the winner that she literally I

163
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:14,510
went against Paris and Avila for this

164
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:16,700
decision but I feel if I got that Kalyn

165
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:17,780
it deserves this and Oh next I want you

166
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,250
to go buy her product and that's what

167
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:21,010
the channel is all about so hopefully

168
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:23,720
our Vina doesn't hate me and hopefully

169
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:25,190
don't think somehow I really nervous for

170
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:29,120
the elimination I'm not looking forward

171
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:31,540
to that do what I got to do this is the

172
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,350
bowl that I signed up for so let's do it

173
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:36,140
unfortunately say after the judges

174
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:37,970
deliberation at your video was not our

175
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:40,450
favor of the day and you have been

176
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:40,450
eliminated

177
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:50,499
how do you feel I don't know expect the

178
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:55,120
people to be emotional so I don't know

179
00:09:50,499 --> 00:09:57,639
maybe maybe I'm not surprised but I that

180
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,870
was so hard and just like saga always

181
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:00,220
how much she wanted how much was

182
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:02,499
clutched that being said it's like a

183
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:04,059
quarter of the positives everybody was

184
00:10:02,499 --> 00:10:06,220
here for a reason and the other girl who

185
00:10:04,059 --> 00:10:08,499

make up to school I think I did like

204
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:20,560
three times total and it wasn't because

205
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:21,520
I was too scared or I'm confident if

206
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,020
they want to wake up early enough to

207
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:25,020

to the other contestants today the

00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:42,400
week it was very hard self critiquing

225
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:43,870
from software challenge today but I

226
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:47,320
think it's important as artists to know

227
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:51,790
when you do not before to abandon stop I

228
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:53,230

follow him on Instagram as soon as we

230
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:56,110

00:12:56,110 --> 00:13:08,560

00:16:47,079 --> 00:16:51,250

305
00:16:51,250 --> 00:17:15,490
by what I saw right well hey I think we

00:16:56,829 --> 00:17:17,439
have potential to be a beauty superstar

307
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:20,049
there'll be a few special guests and

308
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:23,339
it's hon of surprises but in the end

309
00:17:20,049 --> 00:17:33,340
only one can become an instant

310
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:51,059
influencer coming after we finish

311
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:56,890
majority of this and you are a tonight

312
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:58,960
what I basically means a lot of four

313
00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:01,299
contestants actually hit on to set the

314
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:04,419
tone of a show while going through and

315
00:18:01,299 --> 00:18:05,890
like speak at nothing as if the

316
00:18:04,419 --> 00:18:07,390
competitors are actually standing in

317
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:08,679
order to make sure that you get clean

318
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:12,150
tastes we've actually been enjoy

319
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:14,470
successful so far getting really good

320
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:16,419
how I don't we said are you guys know

321
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:22,920
this but it sounded just kind of a

322
00:18:16,419 --> 00:18:25,180
precaution safety photographers today so

323
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,950
let's go say let's go alright the great

324
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:29,530
it is the end of day at number four I do

325
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:31,840
my final anomaly I would do a scroll

326
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:45,250
with this revenue with others but this

327
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:48,130
beautiful books and the competition okay

328
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:50,080
Lauren eating my toenails I feel so bad

ones got on it and I forgot but

331
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,350
ultimately came down to consistency

332
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,360
throughout the competition and who I

333
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:17,290
think has what it takes to be a beauty

334
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:20,220
superstar our first ever instant

335
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:20,220
