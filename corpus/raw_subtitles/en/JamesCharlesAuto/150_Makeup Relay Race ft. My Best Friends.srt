12
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,840
a very very long time I've known

13
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:29,220
everyone here except for drew for almost

14
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:31,920
more it's like almost four years now

15
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,210
yeah whoa that's so crazy all of us

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,710
starting a group chat together called at

17
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:36,690
the kitty girls and we literally talk

18
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,550
all day long every single day and we're

19
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:41,309
pretty what's together at least like

20
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:42,750
three to four times a week to open the

21
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:44,820
Kathy actually live with me and tours

22
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,039
here almost every night so it's pretty

23
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:56,850
much a family fiesta it's honestly a

24
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:58,170
good first time I think one of my

25
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,609
favorite videos that I've ever filmed on

26
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,350
this channel was a collab with pretty

27
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:03,059
much the entire vlog squad and we played

28
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,680
a game called a make up relay race

29
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:05,640
ironically the same exact game it would

30
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,080
dis been great because we've been

31
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,640
friends for such a long time now we've

32
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,290
been through so much together our

33
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,070
friendship has been tested and I feel

34
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,600
like we've always come out on top

35
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:15,180
stronger than ever

36
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,439
but we've never been tested as makeup

37
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,780
artists and that that's what my youtube

38
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:20,640
channel is all about so for today's

39
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:25,200
video we're going to be playing makeup

40
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,640
relay race everybody excited yeah in

41
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,080
case you guys into the first make up

42
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,909
relay race video basically how it works

43
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,380
is just like a normal relay race we have

44
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:33,030
our numbers 1 through 6 here and the

45
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,229
iconic wall power from last video which

46
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,509
by the way if you've not yet seen it

47
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:38,310

00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:40,500
and everybody's going to pick a number

49
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,939
out of the Hat and then that is going to

50
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,430
be the order that all the Kitty girls

51
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:46,259
will have 5 minutes to do whatever part

52
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,280
of my makeup routine that they want the

53
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:48,540
whole point is that you're only as

54
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,210
strong as your weakest link

55
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:54,470
we do have makeup artists and the screw

56
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:54,470
so this could

57
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:00,400
okay I'm on the ride let's talk about

58
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:01,390
that my booking fee is low let's talk

59
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,850
about this for a second because I do

60
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:05,470
feel like the playfield it's like very

61
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:08,200
even like when it was the bomb squad

62
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:09,700
nobody knew anything about makeup but we

63
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:22,300

64
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:23,800

116
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,740
be like that

117
00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:48,300

121
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:58,919
great start with you later okay oh can I

122
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,630
say in one way that I think our

123
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:02,790
relationship has changed a lot yes I

124
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:04,050
feel like one thing that I really love

125
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:06,570
is that you've almost taken on like

126
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:08,190
almost like a fatherly role with me

127
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:09,450
along sided with Elden too obviously

128
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:11,940
sure especially when it comes to like

129
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:13,320
relationship stuff yeah dealt with a lot

130
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,460

nodine's I don't leave

133
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:17,530
that idea I think you should look at

134
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,760
this play or do it this way like this

135
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,960

136
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:22,210
hurt I'm like I really respect that

00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:25,419
someone who's older but also like I feel

139
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:27,699
like it's a really good husband in the

140
00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:29,770

00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:18,910
I have a few questions lined up to ask

153
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:20,169
you three two one go okay concealer even

154
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:21,940

do her makeup she just does her own

157
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:26,770
thing so this is what a lot of people

158
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,349
may not know is that we actually work

159
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:30,490
together every day and live together -

160
00:06:29,349 --> 00:06:32,470
were just kind of month Alden was

161
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:35,500
actually working as an aerospace a

162
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:38,139
machinist yeah beforehand so very smart

163
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:40,750
organized engineering type of person

164
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:43,690
like going from like aerospace machinery

165
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:44,860
to beauty guru full-time employees very

166
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:47,919
very different I would assume right

167
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:49,960
basically before I was like talking

168
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:51,550
clock out yeah coming to work at like

169
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,740
6:00 in the morning and then leaving

170
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:56,889
like at 3:00 yeah so like you climbing

171
00:06:53,740 --> 00:07:01,500
yeah running out of time we're gonna

172
00:06:56,889 --> 00:07:04,360
bake now so now our schedules like very

173
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,800
sporadic and we travel a lot there's

174
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,210
like so much different things going on

175
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,550
compared to like what I did before

176
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:11,740
before is like pretty routine yeah and

177
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:12,940
like this is like so different I want to

178
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,080
ask what would you say is the best part

179
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,340
of working together what would you say

180
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,920
is the worst part of working together

181
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,720
and you

182
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,790
be honest this is a good question for me

183
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:22,250
as they as human resources department

184
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:25,250
the best part is all the traveling and

185
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:28,070
everything yeah the I would say the

186
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:29,450
worst part is probably well a lot of

187
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:31,490
times Cassie gets to come with us too

188
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:32,840
but it's hard because we have to French

189
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:34,730
bulldogs that we have to leave behind

190
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:37,340
and sometimes Cassie isn't able to go

191
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:39,020
yeah which I would love like for all of

192
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,770
us to go well the whole group would be

193
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,930
awesome job

194
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:43,730
oh I want the worst part of not being

195
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:50,120
able to be there

196
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:53,840
well actually the worst part is we

197
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:57,050
usually have the same food every week

198
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,130
like repeated yeah so like week after

199
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:59,450
week it's like the same thing because

200
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:00,710
you have like your favorite meals and

201
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:03,650
everything I look at California Pizza

202
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:05,600
Kitchen barbeque chicken the way we go

203
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:08,560
around that is when you're out we get to

204
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,560
order whatever we want

205
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:32,780
we are always having a good time look

206
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:38,600
good increase I just ate by flowing so

207
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:39,680
there might like I think all right fine

208
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,600
that's all the talk I'm gonna ask you a

209
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:46,730
few questions about our friendship - I

210
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:54,770
don't want to answer those ones ready

228
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:40,200
favorite things we do together

229
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:41,790
yeah those we both do you kind of the

230
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,650
same thing like I having YouTube channel

231
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:46,290

234
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:51,660
don't like we're not competitive at all

235
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:54,570
yeah there's like no over there's no

236
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,920
overlap but yeah yeah I truly feel like

237
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:57,030
some of my favorite most productive days

238
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,740
or when you and I to sit down together

239
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:00,300
and like just brainstorm ideas and just

240
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,110
like bounce ideas back and forth yeah

241
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:13,020
agreed

242
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:16,230
yeah okay I mean I just going with my

243
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:17,310
finger okay oh wow brave I know I'm a

244
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:18,810
makeup artist okay

245
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:20,850
as a fashion blogger true how do you

246
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:22,830
feel about my fashion I think it's good

247
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:23,550
I think it's definitely developed like

248
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,620
in a good way

249
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:27,990
yeah like I think when I first met you

250
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:30,120
it was very like just like Instagram boy

251
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:31,050
like like Instagram girl or whatever but

252
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,730
now it's definitely come more

253
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:34,860
high-fashion but I still wanna see you

254
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:36,570
like wear more color for sure for sure

255
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,310
like cuz you would still like very

256
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:40,140
Street and like wears a lot of black

257
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:41,850
which is fine like that's what you

258
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:44,010

259
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:45,280
to be more fashion which is introducing

260
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:59,080

obviously still very young

305
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,410

00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:12,450
or a terrible parent if I want to change

307
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:15,510
my mind you know honestly I thought you

309
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:19,320
you know Sunday that we were here I

310
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:20,790
think you took Elliot to play the piano

just going right in yeah okay Cassie the

350
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,360
first thing that I want to ask you when

351
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,980
I was with health and I talked about how

352
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,020
are you and him kind of live with me at

353
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:18,420
this point literally my favorite thing

354
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:20,010
that ever happened to me just constant

355
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:21,780
fun and craziness at the house what has

356
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:23,760
been your favorite thing that's happened

357
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:25,410
with us living together so far and the

358
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,910
worst thing that you've seen like none

359
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:29,420
of it I like that I'll have to see you

360
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:32,760
the best part honestly is because I live

361
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:35,370
an hour but in LA always over two hours

362
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:38,280
with traffic oh wait yeah so like we're

363
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:39,900
always together anyway and it's just so

364
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:42,330
just pretty much live here at that point

365
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:44,370
because tape all the time and gas yeah

366
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:46,920
and we're such a big family here that it

367
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:49,830
is just so enjoyable to be together

368
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:55,260
every single day yeah but I would say

369
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:57,600
the worst part is literally it literally

370
00:15:55,260 --> 00:16:01,110
comes in every single morning and wakes

371
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:03,780
my ass up Cassie I Cassie Cassie I come

372
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:06,360
in every single afternoon acting and

373
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:10,020
wait you are at roughly between 12:00

374
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:11,940
and 3:00 p.m. if you guys don't know I'm

375
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:14,220
nocturnal so I stay up till literally

376
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:16,710
sunrise and I sleep during the day but

377
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:21,030
miss Jamie Charlie over here like a good

378
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:22,470
old sunrise awakening so sometimes

379
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:24,090
they'll come in and like cuddle in bed

380
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:27,410
and then sometime Cassie

381
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:27,410
rise and shine

382
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:32,660
so that is our routine over here you're

383
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:34,550
never gonna break your routine if you

384
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:36,140
and your let you sleep until 4:00 p.m.

385
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:38,060
once you're going to absolutely do if we

386
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:39,290
don't wake you up - so cast a lot of my

387
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:41,120
followers have started to follow you

388
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:42,890
because you upload a lot of vlogs on

389
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,480
your channel a lot of times obviously

390
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:45,440
we're always traveling together so it

391
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,480
happens to be like vlogs

392
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,709
behind-the-scenes footage yes our meet

393
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,269
grace are different events would stop

394
00:16:48,709 --> 00:16:51,950
what's one thing that people might not

395
00:16:50,269 --> 00:16:52,810
know that goes on behind the scenes of

396
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:55,910
the vlogs

397
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:57,890
honestly I feel like we're very open and

398
00:16:55,910 --> 00:17:00,680
pretty honest with you guys like we put

399
00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:05,179
all of us out there but I would save it

400
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:08,689
we're not exactly always PG and so is

401
00:17:05,179 --> 00:17:11,750
YouTube monetization I think we cut a

402
00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:13,579
lot of like our playful vulgar names out

403
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:15,079
a lot of kids onto my videos of a lot of

404
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:16,819
kids watch my videos with their parents

405
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:18,230
I do try to always make sure my channel

406
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:20,179
is appropriate for everybody

407
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:21,949
we're definitely much crazier if that's

408
00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:23,569
even possible behind the scenes yeah I

409
00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:32,540
mean you definitely see more crazy stuff

410
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:43,040
on my channel then you're just very

411
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:44,390
inside inside look a little better but I

412
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:50,179
do get a little carried away talking

413
00:17:44,390 --> 00:18:14,000
