143
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,840

some of them that's for yes or no

145
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:10,400
interesting would you like to elaborate

146
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,080
yeah i think some of the people that

147
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,680
have become famous from tech talk do

148
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,280
deserve it but i definitely

149
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,479
before tick tock the only way to really

150
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,919
get popular the internet was like

151
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,280
youtube where like twitch which i feel

152
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,960
like definitely requires a lot more

153
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,400
work than how a lot of the big tick

154
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,479
talkers think famous

155
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,280

um yeah it's true

171
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,720
i don't think i'm the best singer james

172
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,240
charles yeah do you believe the james

173
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,160
charles x morphe palette is the best

174
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,319
palette ever made

175
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,319
no

176
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,960
why i mean i guess that's good for me

177
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,319
but i think better better is a

178
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,759
subjective term

179
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,680
okay well we're deflecting better in

180
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,000
terms of like formula better in terms of

181
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,039
like

182
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,759
more use was your account hacking

183
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,840
just a ploy just so you could leak your

184
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,840
butt picks

185
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,440
no true

186
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,360
but it was a fun part that was

187
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,319
horrifying but i thought might as well

188
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,879
make the most of it

189
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:56,479
have you ever collabed with someone that

190
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,479
has a bad makeup line out

191
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,680
no you know i'm thinking further

192
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,360
yeah oh see that was an example of me

193
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,639
genuinely thinking that i was giving a

194
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,360
true answer but

195
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,680
that was not true and now i'm realizing

196
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,080
that

197
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,319
