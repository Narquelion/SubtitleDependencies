14
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,250

the bombs in the dressing room and I

22
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,840

00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,610
makeup palette shut for emphasis during

24
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:55,980
her fight and upon further investigation

25
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:58,320
a little bit of a I realize more people

26
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,940

was so cool and a literally within a few

36
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:27,479
hours every single one of the Dance Moms

37
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:29,579

38
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:31,200

42
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,259

43
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,220

saying together I want to teach you how

45

to dance and I said good luck with that

46
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:46,439
because I literally cannot dance to save

47
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,180
my life but I could not pass up this

48
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:49,560
opportunity I want to take a lesson from

49
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,850
the Queen Abby Lee herself if there's

50
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,189
anybody that can teach me how to not

51
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:54,270
have two left feet it is her I heard

52
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:55,710

53
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:57,869

55
00:01:57,869 --> 00:01:59,880
take you guys how they started me

56
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,890
because it's probably gonna be a really

57
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,370
really embarrassing and I can't wait to

58
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,410
get yelled at by Abby

59
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:15,590

[Laughter]

64
00:02:48,269 --> 00:03:00,750
very for now like you should yeah so

65
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,750
feet together and you're just gonna jump

66
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:12,750
[Music]

67
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,579
now you just learned the transfer your

68
00:03:19,349 --> 00:03:27,480
weight your one from the other and

69
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:29,430
that's what dancing is so now you

70
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:32,670
understand there's something copying

71
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:36,650
levy so when you jump do a straddle jump

72
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:39,510

73
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:42,359

00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,940
learning is like the building blocks

80
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:14,519

00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:52,549
he's he's gonna go be lazy and soak in

191
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:54,860
the hot tub you think that he would go

192
00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:57,970
practice in Ellison tomorrow morning you

193
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:57,970
better be here you better know

194
00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:17,519
all right you guys beer back home now

195
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,010
after the dance class but I'm actually

196
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:22,980
filming this outro a few days later I

197
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:24,360
already felt mess but I wanted to redo

198
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:26,940
it right before I'm uploading this video

199
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:29,340
because you will not believe what my

200
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,960
body has went through in the past few

201
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:33,299
days at this point I don't even really

202
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,610
know if I can believe it I like very

203
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:37,620
very confused because doing the routine

204
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:40,200
was very very hard but it was hard

205
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:42,330
because I'm not good at like hand I put

206
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,679
full body coordination at memorizing a

207
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:45,299
routine like that and being able to put

208
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,549
on a performance at the same time is

209
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:49,260
very very hard I gave it the dancers so

210
00:18:47,549 --> 00:18:50,460
much props it was also very very hot in

211
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:53,010
there so I was sweating in my entire

212
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:55,289
face and makeup off but physically the

213
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:58,950
actual like steps were not hard on my

214
00:18:55,289 --> 00:19:01,470
body but for some reason I woke up the

215
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:05,940
next morning so sore but over the past

216
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:08,010
two days it is got so much I like people

217
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:10,500
literally barely even walk and I am

218
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:12,210
getting very very worried i sat in the

219
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:18,690
hot tub for several hours I've tried one

220
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:21,500
of the muscle rollers whoa my friends it

221
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:21,500
gives me massages

222
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:27,540
and my knees are just not exactly

223
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:28,830
functioning so I'm not sure if this is

224
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,660
normal because this is my first time

225
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:33,630
dancing but this is literally the most

226
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:35,970
pain I've ever ever been in and this

227
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:38,670
just goes to show how incredible and how

228
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:40,350
much work and love and physical strength

229
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:41,820
that goes into the actual art of dancing

230
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:43,860
I went to this challenge today already

231
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:45,030
having have so much respect for

232
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,440
everybody in the dance industry

233
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:48,060
everybody from the dancers the

234
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,890
choreographers and the actual teachers

235
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:51,540
as well there's so much that goes into

236
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:53,040
putting together a beautiful routine and

237
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:54,480
just getting to kind of see the behind

238
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,730
the scenes process and be a part of the

239
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,410
job 1 for a few seconds was so much fun

240
00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:00,360
and just maybe respect it that much more

241
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:01,590
I'm very very grateful to both Abby Lee

242
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,670
Miller and the Dance Moms

243
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:05,340
and the girls that were there in the

244
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:08,190
studio helping me out and being so so so

245
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:09,390
patient with me I'm horrified to know

246
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:11,850
how much I would have gotten yelled at

247
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:13,470
if I wasn't a youtuber and I was an

248
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:15,420
actual dance student Abby's an

249
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:17,100
incredible teacher and it's really

250
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:18,780
obvious that she has so much passion for

251
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,040
these girls is wanting them to be the

252
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:22,530
best interest they possibly can be and

253
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:24,510
who knows maybe I could be a performer

254
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:25,590
one day probably not with that

255
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:27,330
performance that you guys just watched

256
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:29,040
but practice makes perfect with just

257
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:30,450
