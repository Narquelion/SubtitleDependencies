16
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:34,890

24
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,039
this video is not sponsored morphe is

25
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,750
not sending me a check for posting this

26
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,399
video and i don't know why people will

27
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,899
always like comment speculating whether

28
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:57,030
or not things are sponsored in case you

29
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:59,219
didn't know it is literally illegal to

30
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,780
have a sponsored video and lie about it

31
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:03,899
like I'm trying to decorate my apartment

32
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,970

the fact that they are this dirty and

41
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,600

00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,150

43
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,409

I don't use my Beauty Blender is the

56
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,110

video is already off to an amazing start

62
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:02,250
the next purse that I want to talk about

63
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:03,509
is the RZ r and this is for 2299 this is

64
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,310
the most expensive brush I'll be talking

65
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:06,840
about today after I do all my foundation

66
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:08,350
and my concealer and blend it and I will

67
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,730
use this brush and go into my trends

68
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:11,740
powder to really really lightly like

69
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:12,850
doses all over the face just to get a

70
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,590
light coverage of powder and just to

71
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:17,260
kind of lock everything in before I go

72
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:18,640
in and really like bake it up and I

73
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:20,650
always use this to blend on my neck as

74
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,080
well because we don't want that line of

75
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:24,130
demarcation keep feeling sisters the

76
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,470
next brush that I use in my routine

77
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:28,810
always is the e-40 it is a pointed

78
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:30,070
powder brush it is $8.99 a this is

79
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:32,200
actually the first brush that I ever

80
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:33,550
bought for morphe after my face is all

81
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,900
set you guys know I love all the

82
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:36,190
coverage in the entire room so I've

83
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,870
always gone with my Mac Studio Fix

84
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:39,130
foundation powder in the shade and three

85
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:40,510
I don't know why I'm telling you that

86
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:41,800
doesn't matter but I always use this

87
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:43,240
brush just to pack this right under the

88
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,740
eyes and in the center of the forehead

89
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,270
chin and then right under the contour

90
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,710
area as well it's just like the perfect

91
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:49,120
brush and it really packs the color and

92
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:51,010
they're in place but doesn't make it too

93
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,870
harsh definitely would recommend this

94
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:56,740
one the next one I always use my routine

95
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:58,960
is the r7 and this one is $15.99 this is

96
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:01,360
my bronzing brush it is so freaking good

97
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:06,430
it's actually like pretty large for a

98
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:08,140
bronzing paddle fluffy type brush I love

99
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:10,810
English this is the perfect brush for

100
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:12,250
bronzing oh it really does a really good

101
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,390
job with like this person the color on

102
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:16,090
the cheeks and then I always lend it up

103
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:17,980
on the temple up to it the forehead the

104
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:20,140
other cheek and then on the jaw line as

105
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:22,030
well the only one my all-time favorite

106
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,110
brushes after bronzing my necks that was

107
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,580
always to contour and for that I

108
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:28,450
actually have two brushes that I always

109
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:31,270
use I have the m4 35 which is $8.99 in

110
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:33,160
the M 405 which is $7.99 and I actually

111
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:34,750
prefer the 405 a little bit better

112
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,920
they are both angled foamy brushes that

113
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,450
are perfect for getting right in the

114
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,370
hollows of the cheeks and right on the

115
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:41,050
edges at the forehead and carving out

116
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:42,520
the drawing as well I like this one

117
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:43,750
because it's a little bit more stiff

118
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,610
than this one it's a little bit less

119
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:48,100
fluffy so it's more of like a defined

120
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:49,180
line anyway they work exactly the same

121
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,850
it might as well just save the dollar

122
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:53,800
and get this one at the M 405 after I

123
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:55,150
contour my face I say a short prayer and

124
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,340
they brace myself because my next step

125
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:59,410
is contouring my nose you guys know that

126
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:01,240
contract my nose has been a long time

127
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:03,430
learning process for me it is something

128
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:05,200
that I have struggled with for a long

129
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:07,060
time because my nose is so early it

130
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,220
never looks good it still honestly could

131
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:10,930
look a whole lot better but the one

132
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:13,270
brush that literally save life in my

133
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:15,820
nose contra is the JT weighty a 182

134
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:16,690
brush with Luxy that is a mouthful but

135
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,950
this brush

136
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:19,900
literally was that from the hem

137
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:21,310
above this brush was gifted to me an

138
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,570
asset at generation Beauty so I never

139
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:24,490
actually bought it so I just went online

140
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:26,320
to luck see beauty com2 look at the

141
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:28,330
brushes and I lied this is the most

142
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,640
expensive brush in this video it is $24

143
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:32,890
but trust me when I say oh my god it is

144
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,150
so worth it I always use the angle tie

145
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:35,680
to kind of sketch out what I want the

146
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:37,300
nose contour to be and then this side is

147
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,320
perfect for blending it out and making

148
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,780
sure that looks like really really

149
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,940
snatched but not to like dry coin me

150
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:45,160
although we love that look - I don't

151
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:46,330
have a cold luck see and I know $24 may

152
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,310
seem like a lot of money to spend on

153
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:50,080
such a small brush but trust me this is

154
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:51,340
so worth it I'm not even kidding this

155
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,420
literally saved away from my nose

156
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:54,340
contour and is probably one of my

157
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:56,470
all-time favorite brushes as stupid and

158
00:04:54,340 --> 00:05:00,550
cheesy as that sounds I seriously would

159
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:01,900
not look decent without it well my face

160
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,700
is faking my next step is always to do

161
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,900
my eyebrows if you've been following me

162
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,820
for a long time now you know that my

163
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,440
brows have gone through a drastic change

164
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:10,240
since the beginning my Instagram page

165
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,890
and it was definitely for the better

166
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,500
when I first started off my eyebrows

167
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:15,850
were huge I would pack on the Anasazi

168
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,250
Beverly Hills different in the shade i

169
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:19,900
bonita they were so freaking dark and

170
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,070
thick when I did do that silent brow I

171
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,490
would always use an angled brush like

172
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,520
this

173
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:26,020
this is the r44 and it is only 399 it

174
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,640
has a spoolie on one end and an angled

175
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,110
brush on the other end but recently I've

176
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,490
been loving using front pencils just to

177
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:32,110
go for the more light and fluffy look

178
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:33,340
that is why it now has pink look a

179
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:35,050
lipstick on this and because I don't use

180
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:37,270
this anymore but if you still like that

181
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:38,560
style of instar brow look definitely

182
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,420
recommend it this one to check out

183
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,100
once eyebrows are all signed plates

184
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:43,390
they're probably looking crazy messy so

185
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,400
I like to go in and clean them up using

186
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:47,880
my favorite concealer and a flat top

187
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:50,170
concealer brush does the e43 and it is

188
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,150
$4.99 this is the only concealer brush I

189
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:54,250
ever use and it is super easy to just go

190
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:56,110
right in and carve out a super straight

191
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,580
and on fleek brow that is all I have to

192
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:59,200
say about this brush it is just really

193
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:00,850
good once I concealer under my brows

194
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,440
it's all pointed out I like to go into

195
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:04,240
the more concealer on the eyelid to then

196
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,400
set my eyes in place to prime for

197
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,930
eyeshadow to do this I always use my e45

198
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,370
and my shape tape and then coating or

199
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:11,260
some powder I use the same brush

200
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:14,050
actually for the powder and liquid and

201
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:15,850
this brush is $5.99 it is just a short

202
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:17,890
domed powder brush and it says on the

203
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:19,510
website it is a mini detail contour

204
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:20,770
brush obviously it's a brush you can do

205
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:22,390
whatever the hell you want with it it's

206
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:23,800
never that serious but I really like

207
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,970
this for packing the eyelid

208
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,560
it gets all the concealer bended out

209
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:27,850
really really quickly and easily impacts

210
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,300
everything in place so I know that my

211
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:30,310
eyeshadow

212
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:32,020
not gonna go any winner with the face

213
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:34,180
all complete and be for the heavens we

214
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:36,310
are not ready for a shadow trust me when

215
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:38,979
I say you need this brush in your life

216
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:40,900
this is the m4 for one and it is $5.99

217
00:06:38,979 --> 00:06:42,430
it says on the website that it is a pro

218
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,199
firm blending crease but there is

219
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:46,389
nothing firm about this brush it is

220
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:48,400
literally the best like big fluffy

221
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:53,229
crease brush ever and I'm not kidding I

222
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:55,060
think I have at least 1 2 3 4 5

223
00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:56,319
I literally have six of them that are

224
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,849
just in front of me and this is just

225
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,289
from filling my looks today all many

226
00:06:57,849 --> 00:07:00,819
other brushes are in the other room it

227
00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:02,259
is always the first person I pick up

228
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:03,849
when I do I shadow I just use my

229
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:05,229
transition shade and I go all over the

230
00:07:03,849 --> 00:07:06,490
crease the I'm four for one is

231
00:07:05,229 --> 00:07:07,629
definitely need in your collection I

232
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:09,940
would definitely recommend ordering like

233
00:07:07,629 --> 00:07:12,159
at least two or three them you will use

234
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:14,139
all of them I promise the next one I

235
00:07:12,159 --> 00:07:15,370
want to talk about is the m4 33 and this

236
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:17,319
is probably my number one if you're a

237
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:19,060
brush from morphe this brush is $5.99

238
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:20,289
and is a fluffy crease brush and it is

239
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:23,319
basically the same thing as the Sigma

240
00:07:20,289 --> 00:07:24,639
e25 in the Mac 217 I was like the holy

241
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:26,650
grail crease brush is that literally

242
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,780
every makeup whoever has at least like

243
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:30,909
50 of it is perfect for hitting right

244
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,900
into that crease area it is condensed to

245
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:33,250
the point where you distribute this

246
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,750
shadow where you want it but it's still

247
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:38,529
flopping so it blends and out while

248
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:40,840
you're putting it there six seven yeah

249
00:07:38,529 --> 00:07:42,490
seven brushes right here once again one

250
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,990
of the ones that I have so many of but

251
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:45,430
literally use every single one of them

252
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:47,740
the next part I want to talk about today

253
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:49,569
is the m56 too and this is another one

254
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,650
of those that I have several of you know

255
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:51,940
when you're doing this multi eye or a

256
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:53,560
half cut crease and you want to deepen

257
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,909
out the darker corner and like you don't

258
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,800
have a darker shade so you know you have

259
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:58,029
to use black but you know if you go in

260
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,440
with a fluffy brush in the black it's

261
00:07:58,029 --> 00:08:01,599
gonna make everything muddy and gross

262
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,129
and way too dark this is the brush you

263
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,539
need in your life it's really really

264
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:06,129
tiny but still fluffy so you can get

265
00:08:04,539 --> 00:08:07,360
right into the crease and outer corner

266
00:08:06,129 --> 00:08:09,909
and blend everything out really really

267
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,349
seamlessly I freaking love this brush

268
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:13,990
the next part I want to talk about is

269
00:08:11,349 --> 00:08:15,699
the m22 four and this one is $2.99 I

270
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:17,620
always will go in with some fix+ or some

271
00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:19,060
setting spray spritz this brush and then

272
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:20,919
dip into like a metallic shadow or a

273
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:22,389
pigment and then pack it right onto

274
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:25,090
either cut the crease or just do a

275
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:26,440
metallic eyelid it is super duper dense

276
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:27,669
so it is absolutely perfect for getting

277
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,500
the shadow on there and making sure it

278
00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:31,449
is all there and SuperDuper pigmented

279
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,860
once the eye shadow is done on the top I

280
00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:34,930
always want the bottom and I always

281
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:36,610
started the m56 to the same brush I just

282
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:38,140
talked about always get like even color

283
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,010
on there and then the brush I always use

284
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:41,770
the m2

285
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:43,990
13 this brush is $1.99 na just a small

286
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:45,490
detailed smudger brush it is perfect if

287
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:47,020
you have like anything in the water line

288
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:48,340
that you want to blend down or if you

289
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:50,050
just want to deep it up right up close

290
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:52,060
to the lash line or do any do to work in

291
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:53,590
general really this is perfect I also

292
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:55,570
use this brush for a smoky winged liner

293
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:56,920
back to that ways pop on lashes and

294
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:59,620
mascara and that's just using tweezers

295
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,030
and mascara not that deep nope artist

296
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:03,070
involved and the last step will be

297
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:04,930
highlighter my first live here for

298
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:07,540
highlighting my cheeks is the amma 501

299
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:10,810
and this one is $7.99 personally I am

300
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:12,610
NOT a fan of fan brushes but I'm right

301
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:14,020
for highlighting my face that was not

302
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:15,490
 funny I feel like it doesn't

303
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,450
blend out the pigment evenly and a lot

304
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:18,130
of times on this end I would like a

305
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:19,870
straight line of highlighter which is

306
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:21,580
never ever the goal so I really like

307
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:25,690
this one instead it just gives like a

308
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:27,370
nice fluffy dispersed heavenly glow the

309
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:30,550
last and final brush in this favorite

310
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:33,100
series thank God is the m43 one this

311
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:35,050
brush is $4.99 and it is a tiny pencil

312
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:36,220
brush most pencil brushes are round at

313
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:37,600
the end but this one is a little bit

314
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:39,580
tapered off and it does have a slight

315
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,140
point so I always use the very tip of

316
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:43,120
this brush to go right in on the tip of

317
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:45,040
my nose and then I'll just go one line

318
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,810
right down the bridge to contour out my

319
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,860
nose then with the same brush and more

320
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:49,420
highlighter I'll just go right on my

321
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,770
inner corners just blending that out and

322
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,810
then I'll pop this on the brow bone as

323
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:54,910
well just for that even highlighter all

324
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:57,400
