hi sisters james charles here and

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,000
welcome back to my youtube channel

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,119
a few years ago you guys know that i

8
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,800

9
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,719
palette and thanks to your guys's love

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,280
and support it sold out in only a few

11
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,879
minutes flat which was absolutely crazy

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,000
because of that though within only a few

13
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,680
days there were fake

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,120
knock-off palettes popping up left and

15
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,000
right so i decided to film a video for

16
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,840
my youtube channel

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,440
called testing out a fake james charles

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,360
palette where i did just

19
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,800
that and a few years later little did i

20
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,760
know it will become one of my most

21
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,920
viewed videos

22
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,760
of all time since that video you guys

23
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,440
have been asking me non-stop to review

24
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,760
more fake palettes but the only problem

25
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,039
is

26
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,199
i haven't released any other makeup

27
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,960

28
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,359
not been any new fake palettes there has

29
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,600
been

30
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,520
quite a lot of fake james charles

31
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,119
products that have popped up online over

32
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,240

okay are you talking about the best in

55
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,040
terms of production quality are the best

56
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,119
just in terms of the actual item

i've ever felt this feels like a bandana

65
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:14,560
this feels like the motel sticks on exit

66
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,599
or motel six is that what that's what

67
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,360

77
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,840

just one fake sister's apparel item

135
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,639
please i would love to see a fake system

136
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,720
hair lighter

137
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,720
let me just say that this item is out of

138
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:57,360
this world

139
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:59,919
oh gosh oh no

140
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,360
yikes literally all they did was take a

141
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,960
picture of the galaxy from google and

142
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,479
blow it up this actually looks like i

143
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,080
put this hoodie into photoshop and then

144
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,600
like put a nice blur on it

145
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,199
and now i'm looking at it somehow that

146
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,880
being said like why would it kind of be

147
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,160
cute to do like a galaxy collection for

148
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,479
sisters apparel

149
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,840
that's not the one no this is not it

150
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,199
this hoodie will not be part of it

151
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,560
like that would be like that would kind

152
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,560
of be everything the inside of this

153
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,160
hoodie feels like a camping tent

154
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,199
like a sleeping bag but not a good one

155
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,759
how much was this

156
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,080
this is trash oh it's also extra what

157
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,800
the oh my god it's like stretch fabric

158
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,520
it might be a tent well this is

159
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,560
definitely fun

160
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,800
i think the worst part about this is

161
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,240
that it was 38 for this piece of trash

162
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,680
and like an actual sister's hoodie

163
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,680
that's good quality and gorgeous

164
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,960
it's 45 like it's only a few dollars

165
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,240
more for the difference between

166
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,759
this and a real one like

167
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:52,800
i want to make sure that you're covered

168
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:55,840
on both ends of your body sure

169
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,600
yeah is this a skirt you've got to

170
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,759
kidding me this is the pencil skirt

171
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,120
with this disgusting photo of me on this

172
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,319
from like 2017.

173
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,160
you know what's he oh my god you're the

174
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,360
worst part about this this photo is from

175
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,639
the sister's apparel website they

176
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,639
literally went on our website

177
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,080
stole one of my images from our actual

178
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,560
merch and then went and produced

179
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,479
other merchandise with our photos my

180
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,639
favorite part is the hair cut off on the

181
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,000
back end of the skirt

182
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,240
oh you're probably wondering where's my

183
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,840
hair oh it's right there oh god do i try

184
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,440
this on this is the thumbnail for sure

185
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,560
oh my feet are asleep

filming this video today up until that

297
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,120

completely ruined

299
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,279
everything i think that's all we have

300
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,480
for today's video i honestly had a lot

301
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,000
of fun going through all these fake

302
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,320
items and trying everything on

303
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,160
i would not recommend any of these

304
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,000
products in today's video

305
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,360
the pricing was ridiculously high for

306
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,639
some reason the quality of most of them

307
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,079
is absolute trash

308
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,680
and most importantly i don't know where

309
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,760

310
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,839
