to me during the whole process so you've

198
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:26,659
kind of been involved with that that's a

199
00:06:25,069 --> 00:06:29,180
beginning it's hard to like know a

200
00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:30,860
secret and like keep it in yeah just be

201
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,270
so excited because yeah I've known about

00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:34,219
this obviously for a while you guys and

203
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:37,490
it's just been so cool to watch James

204
00:06:34,219 --> 00:06:39,409
like think of it create it execute it do

205
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:40,729
the shoots the ad campaigns everything

206
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:42,529
it's been just so fun I've been sitting

207
00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:44,539
on this for so long now so it feels so

208
00:06:42,529 --> 00:06:48,110
good until I finally put out well it's

209
00:06:44,539 --> 00:06:50,569
been interesting it's been a wild ride

210
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:52,129
right okay watching some of these

211
00:06:50,569 --> 00:06:53,599
reviews and stuff of people just talking

212
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:55,310
about it like both positive and negative

213
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,650
it's like a really really overwhelming

214
00:06:55,310 --> 00:07:00,259
oh yeah I want to ask you about that oh

215
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:02,629
so someone that started right away right

216
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:03,740
that has created makeup it's so curious

217
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:05,839
to someone when they finally put

218
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:07,939
something out you're like what has been

219
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:09,620
the biggest struggles I guess besides

220
00:07:07,939 --> 00:07:10,729
seeing reviews I don't to say the

221
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,960
biggest things went Ruggles because for

222
00:07:10,729 --> 00:07:12,949
the most part all the reviews have been

223
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,879
so positive

224
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:15,620
and they've it they really have

225
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:17,089
literally like the whole point of the

226
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:19,430
campaign was to only shoot an artist as

227
00:07:17,089 --> 00:07:20,930
I said 800,000 times last month but like

228
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:23,360
I love that looks that I've been seeing

229
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:24,889
people create are like blowing my mind

230
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,500
yeah oh my god even on the way here that

231
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:29,719
crazy yeah oh my god after this game ago

232
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,860
painting yes I've seen so many artists

233
00:07:29,719 --> 00:07:32,659
that I've like loved and looked up to

234
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,099
test out the palette and just do the

235
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:35,360
coolest things with it and like I

236
00:07:34,099 --> 00:07:37,080
literally sure to cry like looking

237
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,370
through

238
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,140
Just Cause like I mean like that's

239
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:41,850
exactly what I want it like I feel are

240
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:43,020
inspired and they're really going into

241
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:44,280
that's what I'm fairly gonna see in

242
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,480
their view if you would really look at

243
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,970
the palette and I'm inspired and I'm

244
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:49,680
like yes that is what I wanted overall

245
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:52,560
the sentiment has been nothing but like

246
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,660
amazing what's been hard is like

247
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,520
obviously I worked on this for a very

248
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:58,020
very long time and I'm super confident

249
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,430
out of like the product that we put out

250
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,510
but of course there's always many people

251
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,650
who don't like it and who want to

252
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,580
criticize which is fine because

253
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,410
everybody has a right to their opinion

254
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,760
but yeah it's really really frustrating

255
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:06,960
when I feel as though at least I've been

256
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,160
pretty transparent with like the

257
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,360
ingredients and what kind of can't be

258
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,710
used in different techniques that I

259
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,650
think work best that a horse has just

260
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:15,690
been like people love to make up like

261
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:16,920
stories and it's kind of hard because we

262
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:18,300
need when you own a brand or when you

263
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,520
pet a product you don't want it to seem

264
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:23,250
like you can't take criticism criticism

265
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,900
is great I love that that's how I've

266
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,730
learned it improved along the way but I

267
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,870
have seen some people making a blatant

268
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:29,820
lies I don't know if you want to address

269
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:31,920
that I mean I'm open about it like just

270
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:34,770
as a consumer I just think have kind of

271
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:36,570
upset seeing people not be honest I

272
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:38,550
guess or like just saying something for

273
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:40,590
attention well I think like the whole

274
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:42,660
press penguins thing has been really

275
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:44,640
quite a learning experience for both me

276
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:47,100
and the morphe team as well like okay I

277
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,200
obviously don't do makeup production

278
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,210
ever I don't have a company and my

279
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,440
channel is not reviews it's not testing

280
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:53,700
all new products ever it's literally

281
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,040
just like I'm gonna throw this look I

282
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:58,470
hope yes nicer news once in a while in a

283
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,820
blue moon right yeah exactly so for me

284
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:01,260
when I was working with the team and

285
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,670
wanted to create a really super matte

286
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,900
and pigmented rainbow palette I learned

287
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:05,340
that a lot of the shades could not be

288
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,720
firm elated as typical actually doesn't

289
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:08,790
know how to be considered press penguins

290
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,230
and yes dad because that's like the way

291
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:12,000
that you get those formulas to work and

292
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:13,890
our sleep blend out which definitely do

293
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,900
take a little bit of more extra love and

294
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:17,790
care what you have to

295
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,290
percent products but when I was filling

296
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,460
my attend million special video a few

297
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,570
days ago I made a reference to the knock

298
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,710
that's like the palette is made for

299
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,970
artists if you were trying to create a

300
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:25,740
watercolor painting you would never put

301
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:27,600
water clubs on campus or you've never

302
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:29,430
put kerlick paint or oil paint on

303
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,660
whatever because it would through if

304
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:32,010
something is formulated a certain way

305
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:34,020
and somebody's telling you hey this

306
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:35,340
works best this way it really blows my

307
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:37,980
mind that people like don't want to hear

308
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:39,360
that and instead they're yeah oh my god

309
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:42,480
like yours quaint with excuses like the

310
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,190
product just socks it's like no every

311
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,290
product has an instruction whether it's

312
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:47,880
this bottle or this sponge there's less

313
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:50,400
instructions over someone's giving you

314
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,840
advice you know you should take it right

315
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,310
it's not mandatory like you can still

316
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,560
put watercolor on campus you can so put

317
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:57,120
oil paint on watercolor paper it's just

318
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,980
not gonna look as good as it could if

319
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,970
you follow the recommended instructions

320
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,710
you know so just dealing with that has

321
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:03,240
been really eye-opening for me because

322
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:04,980
of course like I want to be as educated

323
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,180
as it possibly can when it comes to my

324
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,710
followers purchasing a palette because

325
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,240
my name is on it but at the same time

326
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:10,470
like I'm not a scientist already

327
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,660
learning and educating myself the entire

328
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:14,040
time there was obviously a few people

329
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,930
that made videos about it I'm like why

330
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,490
on different tangents stuff like

331
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:19,680
different staining which oh my god mark

332
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:21,510
can we talk about that I guess do you

333
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,710
want to yeah I don't think it's a bad

334
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:24,450
thing and I think it's cool that I'm

335
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:26,790
actually here because the blood sugar

336
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:28,770
palette that I created YUM earlier this

337
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:31,500
year has been a huge hit it's sold

338
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:34,140
astronomical but half the palette or

339
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:36,060
pressed pigment yeah psyche Lee talked

340
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:37,770
about this in the video I did not so I

341
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,910
okay a lot of tweets be like oh my god

342
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,950
James doesn't care about his consumers

343
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:43,290
Jeffery always cares he always lists

344
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:45,090
everything and I'm like you guys did

345
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:46,740
everything I did I'm also like Jeffrey's

346
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:49,080
been doing this on his channel for a

347
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:50,760
year he does this every single video

348
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,290
I've never done this before so it's like

349
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:55,020
so people were upset that you didn't

350
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:56,490
fully go into detail by or why so I got

351
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:58,020
I'm in full disclosure half the

352
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,100
polonaise pressed pigments I was very

353
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,600
clear about that and very open and

354
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,800
honest about that you'd have to use

355
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,990
certain techniques and products if you

356
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,860
want it to perform the best and because

357
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:07,440
of the fact that there

358
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:09,690
past payments by FDA standards a lot of

359
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,520
them technically are not I say yes but

360
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:12,900
that being said I abuse every sing one

361
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,760
of them on my eye and I've never had an

362
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:16,740
issue almost all my friends are almost

363
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,450
all my friends are but some people do

364
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:20,760
have sensitive skin and sages eyelids

365
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:22,500
yeah and it will stain some people I've

366
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,750
got insane by every single think I've

367
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,560
ever used things like that I don't care

368
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,820
what brand it is

369
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,020
every single thing I said I wouldn't

370
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,670
stay insane but I've never been

371
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,960
effective but the reality is some people

372
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:32,970
do have sensitive skin and can have

373
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,710
allergic reactions but yes it's up to

374
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:35,970
the consumer to of course read the

375
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:36,330
directions if you're allergic to

376
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,160
something

377
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:39,480
check the box before putting it on yeah

378
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,250
because everybody has different

379
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,350
allergies and different skin they do it

380
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:44,880
can be tricky but I think you just got

381
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:46,140
to read the box right I think that I

382
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,850
don't like here's what I think from

383
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:49,230
someone that is an onlooker and as a

384
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:51,270
friend I don't like when people try to

385
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:52,620
make it seem like you are out to do

386
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:54,360
something that you're not like you are

387
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:56,130
out to stay in everyone's limbs and not

388
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,810
tell anyone I'm like oh my god it's just

389
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:59,070
a ridiculous like and I don't want to

390
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:00,480
say that it's common sense because not

391
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:02,130
everyone is gonna be aware that's my

392
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,960
mistake because I obviously wouldn't

393
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:05,250
make up for a very very long time and I

394
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,080
said many times that I formulate this

395
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:08,760
palette for my fellow artists for people

396
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,720
to travel with for people to take with

397
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,520
them and be able to create literally

398
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,660
right but at the same time I was

399
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,190
watching a few videos and a lot of

400
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:16,470
people pointed out I do have a very very

401
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:18,000
diverse audience a few demos of makeup

402
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:20,400
but also have literally never put it on

403
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,650
and just watch my videos we want to

404
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:24,180
support you and try yes so I may not I

405
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:25,740
will admit that it I shouldn't have said

406
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:28,140
that it was common sense because I guess

407
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:29,430
it's really not but in my hat because I

408
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,780
do this every single day and I've always

409
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:32,670
been standard just like of course my

410
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,990
eyeshadows could stain sometimes but I

411
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:36,120
know I understand but not everyone knows

412
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:37,710
that right but I also think if you have

413
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,970
bought something from my brand or morphe

414
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:40,470
before and it's change your live like

415
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:43,680
you're you know bright shadows are gonna

416
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:45,690
stay in yeah but it's also a learning

417
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,520
experience I think that people lying and

418
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:50,040
trying to get attention from it is

419
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:52,890
annoying but that's part of the game

420
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:54,270
right right but it I guess it sucks when

421
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:56,340
you put so much love and care into

422
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:59,340
something and someone wants to flip it

423
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:01,140
and like it's bad and you're like girl

424
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:03,120
what are you talking about so yeah you

425
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:04,440
know you you get your feelings hurt

426
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,300
you know you get upset because you want

427
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,589
to defend it because you

428
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:08,000
you know it's like come on if you're

429
00:13:06,589 --> 00:13:09,589
proud of your work that's your baby

430
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,480
exactly just gonna dip into a little

431
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:13,250
sister setting dinner how has been

432
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,760
driving really good I'm not very good at

433
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,820
that

434
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,140
okay but no crashes yeah good actually

435
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:21,200
crashing me either

436
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:26,570
you don't have noticed people here suck

437
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:28,850
at driving oh my god nobody uses their

438
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:30,470
turn signals no one can tell you why

439
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:33,470
because I'm from here I can tell you why

440
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:35,149
means - because when you do use your

441
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:37,040
turn signal in LA and you're in traffic

442
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:39,050
no one will let you work well yeah I've

443
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,459
noticed that too so no one does anymore

444
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:42,050
because it's like oh when you turn your

445
00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:46,339
signal on in other parts of the world

446
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:48,560
like Michigan or in you know oh yes

447
00:13:46,339 --> 00:13:50,570
please come into my lane yeah over here

448
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,459

450
00:13:52,459 --> 00:13:55,760
blinker you just gotta cut someone off

451
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,890
or you got to be really safe and keep it

452
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,690
moving people are crazy but I love that

453
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:01,100

sitting next to James I already know

469
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,950
just from all my friends using it that

470
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,880
this palette is great I also am NOT

471
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:42,709
concerned so exactly fine and also you

472
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,500
don't probably I mature enough

473
00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:47,930
like we said criticism is everywhere yes

474
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:50,270
okay cool so I like to use a Paint Pot

475
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:51,589
oh my god yeah I need to see you okay

476
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:53,959
that's funny wait what color

477
00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:55,730
painterly paint really this is not okay

478
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:57,290
what the hell I mean this is not planned

479
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:59,180
I always have been formulated to talk

480
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:00,630
for so long now when I came to promoting

481
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:02,220
these colors like we talked about

482
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:04,199
number-one priority with pigmentation

483
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:05,940
yes am i getting those rainbow mattes to

484
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:07,709
be super super vibrant which is hard and

485
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:09,509
if people don't know that in the lab and

486
00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:10,800
in yeah you know the chemists they

487
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:12,990
really have to work hard to make a

488
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,519
beautiful formula they do it's really

489
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:16,529
really challenging it was important to

490
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:18,300
yeah so I'm the type of person I will

491
00:15:16,529 --> 00:15:19,620
say that I'm definitely difficult to

492
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,269
work with because I know what I want and

493
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:24,509
I will never settle for loss which is

494
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:25,769
good love that hi I'm Sophie tv-like do

495
00:15:24,509 --> 00:15:26,699
it they're like no we count like no I

496
00:15:25,769 --> 00:15:27,959
want you to do it

497
00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:29,790
yeah then we can't do that like yeah see

498
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:31,440
well you're gonna do it yeah I think

499
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:33,269
it's cool cuz maybe you pushed their

500
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,579
boundaries and I did which is kind of

501
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:37,259
cool I did and like I'm really part of

502
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:38,579
the finished product and I've heard like

503
00:15:37,259 --> 00:15:40,079
the morphe team is really proud of it as

504
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:43,019
well good they were and they really are

505
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,639
and I think it's great because you

506
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:45,839
challenge them and they listen they

507
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,060
could have been like no we're good

508
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,680
sweetie but the fact that they like took

509
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,880
everything you said into consideration

510
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,100
and you leave me buddy vision come to

511
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,860

00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:57,990
yeah I love morphe so much say well kind

513
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:59,730
of look at you feeling I'm feeling a lot

514
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:01,259
of color do like a red orange yellow and

515
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:02,910
then what I agree Boober well the other

516
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:04,680
are okay I mean yeah I'm you know I'm

517
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:07,709
down I love that I'm really down the

518
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:09,870
purple first I know I'm gonna grab the

519
00:16:07,709 --> 00:16:11,399
shade of area 51 on my tablet four five

520
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:13,889
six brush this is from my brush that

521
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:16,649
more her okay now let's talk about

522
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:19,230
purple shades they are so hard to make I

523
00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:20,819
know it's funny the purple is the only

524
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:23,639
pressed pigment in the alien pellet

525
00:16:20,819 --> 00:16:26,550
really yeah blood sugar had like 12 cuz

526
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:28,050
you know breads are yes yes I don't know

527
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:30,060
how much I can say but I will say that

528
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:31,889
the purple shade gave me quite an issue

529
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:33,120
in black kala and honestly through

530
00:16:31,889 --> 00:16:34,769
formulating the purple is actually how I

531
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,899
figured out that using an eye primer

532
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:39,240
like paint power or like really how's

533
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:41,699
what makes it work so much better

534
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:44,009
I mean use a packet on which I'm saying

535
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:44,610
the entire time hmm okay where do I

536
00:16:44,009 --> 00:16:46,259
start

537
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:49,709
why am I feeling like blues and purples

538
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:51,149
on one eye yeah should I go in at purple

539
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:54,329

nothing but perfection like I'm such a

547
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:08,860
perfectionist I like I I refuse to do

548
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:10,600
anything that was like very scary going

549
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:12,520
into it I'm just gonna blend this out

550
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:14,620

552
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:18,429
everyone asked you if you want to do

553
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:20,230

554
00:17:18,429 --> 00:17:22,120
an Aussie what snacks I'm like ready

556
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,089
breathe I know right when you launch

557
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:26,620
something everyone will be like what's

558
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:28,750
next what's next really a girl let me

559
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:31,390
breathe for a second for me I definitely

560
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:33,640
don't think that I want my own brand

561
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:34,870
right now at least for right now but

562
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,730
honestly I don't even know about the

563
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:38,110
future I'm not that interested about

564
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:40,210
development to be honest with you it's

565
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:41,530
just got something like this palette for

566
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:43,510
me was like my main project that I'm

567
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:44,559
working on for so long and I'm super

568
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:46,450
passionate about and I've had an idea

569
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,190
for forever okay but I don't really have

570
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:49,750
that many other ideas up my sleeve that

571
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:51,220
I'm like oh this needs to be somebody I

572
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:52,510
love that you're not just doing it to do

573
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,679
it there's a lot of people have you in

574
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:55,240
your position we're just kind of like

575
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,590
okay well let's just wing it and let's

576
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,929
just go for and you're like no honey

577
00:17:56,590 --> 00:18:01,330
there are all ways that I obviously can

578
00:17:58,929 --> 00:18:02,650
make a living and make money and I just

579
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,270
don't want to put my name on products

580
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:05,590
just about anyone products like I refuse

581
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:07,090
to do that I don't need to have them

582
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:09,460
very blast of the following fan base

583
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:11,770
that supports whatever I do yeah so I

584
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:13,120
love those wait and see for right now

587
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:19,780

597
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:45,490
crease region I'm really sure what I'm

598
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:47,530
doing but it's looking a pretty so far

599
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:49,240
what was your inspiration behind the

600
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:51,100
alien palette I've been called an alien

601
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:53,260
forever my nickname in high school was a

602
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:55,330
little alien was it really yeah cuz I

603
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:57,820
shaved my eyebrows in 10th grade so

604
00:18:55,330 --> 00:19:00,340
matches yes so for the photo you did

605
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:01,350
yeah so the first imagine that the first

606
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:04,140
day I show up

607
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:07,169
no brows everyone was like Hello what

608
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:09,260
the heck is going on around here so

609
00:19:07,169 --> 00:19:11,490
alien just kind of stuck and I just love

610
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:17,309
extraterrestrial things I think there's

611
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:17,880
obviously I believe in aliens I'm right

612
00:19:17,309 --> 00:19:19,679
here

613
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,510
what they're not the balloon right but I

614
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,280
really wanted to perfect and have like

615
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:24,990
no kinks in my palate like perfect the

616
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,220
Greens just kind of you're like a whole

617
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:27,450
different story and I really want to do

618
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:29,549
a different shape I think I'm done

619
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:30,960
rectangles for all my palettes thus far

620
00:19:29,549 --> 00:19:32,460
right stick in a while that's very

621
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,490
something different you're the packaging

622
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:37,110
is seconding I love it thank you

623
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:39,120
artistry is so ready that's what he was

624
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:40,500
on your leg literally yesterday yeah so

625
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,030
artistry is made to be like a topper

626
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,980
color so it performs best overtop of

627
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:45,299
like a black or a darker but we're like

628
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,590
a blue like it's meant to really bring

629
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:48,059
out those other shades

630
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:50,159
okay there's two shades like that in the

631
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:51,720
poet actually artistry and this

632
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:52,590
literally some people were sparked and

633
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,000
being like oh my god they're not that

634
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,900
pigmented but that's the point

635
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,640
actually they're supposed to be used

636
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,740
okay which ones that one this one this

637
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:02,549
one literally is bad it's literally

638
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:05,159
literally that's like peachy pink so you

639
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:07,140
can either use it for a highlighter if

640
00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:09,570
you use it lightly which I love it looks

641
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:12,030
so stunning or what I like actually

642
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:13,799
using a lot of it and blending it really

643
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:16,169
blends your powder and blush together so

644
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:18,240
I see okay that's why all that later I

645
00:20:16,169 --> 00:20:22,049
really like this color that which all

646
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:24,929
home color oh baby is like a weird Bobby

647
00:20:22,049 --> 00:20:26,490
Brown yeah I'm gonna take more area 51

648
00:20:24,929 --> 00:20:28,770
right now I'm gonna put it on this other

649
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:31,010
ain't gonna hurt he wants to do black in

650
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:34,310
the center with artistry over it

651
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:35,690
oh yeah I just dip into that once hi I

652
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:37,370
love a good black it's really pigmented

653
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:40,010
I was the drama around the palette to

654
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:41,330
the swatches oh my god I don't put on

655
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:43,250
eye shadow with my fingers unless it's

656
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:46,040
like a really crazy metallic so it's

657
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:46,370
like why does what swatches matter so

658
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,810
much

659
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:50,750
I think we're getting away from that

660
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:51,920
hopefully but it's like girl oh my God

661
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,450
look at that black looks like a liner

662
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:56,780
already look at that let me keep it like

663
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:59,660

wait it's like singing it okay so like I

786
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:45,559
said earlier this launch has been

787
00:26:43,909 --> 00:26:47,179
obviously exciting for me but it's also

788
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:48,139
something new that I I've never dealt

789
00:26:47,179 --> 00:26:49,940
with and there's definitely been

790
00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:51,320
challenges with it and I've gotten upset

791
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:53,269
and stuff and I'm trying my best to

792
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,889
really handle myself maturely and be

793
00:26:53,269 --> 00:26:56,570
professional because that my name is

794
00:26:54,889 --> 00:26:57,950
attached obviously we were talking cuz

795
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:59,360
as soon as I announce that you obviously

796
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:01,250
wanted to film with it which was so cool

797
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,840
and meant the world to me yes I was like

798
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:04,730
give me that right now yeah it's not

799
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:06,110
obviously plans change when you had to

800
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:07,909
come homes we weren't able to get it to

801
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:09,769
you right away yes I know you've been

802
00:27:07,909 --> 00:27:11,090
texting me updates all the time keeping

803
00:27:09,769 --> 00:27:13,159
up with the launch keeping up with their

804
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:14,929
sales and stuff and like tax me a little

805
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:16,309
bit stuff like as someone who was a

806
00:27:14,929 --> 00:27:18,019
friend of mine and has been watching at

807
00:27:16,309 --> 00:27:19,940
all but also someone who was a brand

808
00:27:18,019 --> 00:27:22,700
owner and does this all the time do you

809
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:23,570
have any honest advice for me like what

810
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,279
I do something else in the future

811
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:27,049
because I'm obviously learning a lot

812
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:28,639
about launches and like what I can and

813
00:27:27,049 --> 00:27:30,139
shouldn't say or how I should react and

814
00:27:28,639 --> 00:27:32,240
stuff yeah and opposite this has been

815
00:27:30,139 --> 00:27:33,860
quite a learning experience but I'd love

816
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,990
to hear like what okay and put you wrong

817
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:37,159
you'll hear some Realty yes so I had to

818
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:39,649
learn this the hard way

819
00:27:37,159 --> 00:27:41,779
it's like if something ever really does

820
00:27:39,649 --> 00:27:44,059
happen or someone really does have an

821
00:27:41,779 --> 00:27:46,519
issue is to really hear them out right

822
00:27:44,059 --> 00:27:49,159
and not get so offended or on the

823
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:51,440
defense so ready for some real tea so

824
00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:54,429
this happened when my highlighters first

825
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:56,889
launched my delivery people dropped and

826
00:27:54,429 --> 00:27:59,230
higher palates we're talking like 30,000

827
00:27:56,889 --> 00:28:01,119
units they dropped it off of the

828
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:04,899
forklift without ever telling anyone

829
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:07,179
know every highlighter was shattered so

830
00:28:04,899 --> 00:28:09,429
imagine you don't know this right don't

831
00:28:07,179 --> 00:28:11,559
know until later when all the units are

832
00:28:09,429 --> 00:28:13,659
shipped out so when the first few people

833
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:15,399
were getting them I thought people were

834
00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:16,899
just like coming from me like yeah oh

835
00:28:15,399 --> 00:28:19,389
well your products are horrible right

836
00:28:16,899 --> 00:28:20,769
like I had such success with liquid lips

837
00:28:19,389 --> 00:28:22,149
and lip scrub so when I brought the

838
00:28:20,769 --> 00:28:23,529
highlighter I was so proud of it and

839
00:28:22,149 --> 00:28:26,740
people were getting broken but it was

840
00:28:23,529 --> 00:28:28,720
only one shade the one shade of so

841
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:30,490
someone made a video really going in on

842
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,129
me like this whole thing was shattered

843
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:36,009
they're awful that it uh and I clap back

844
00:28:33,129 --> 00:28:37,570
instead of like listening to the

845
00:28:36,009 --> 00:28:39,100
complaint cuz I was like there's no way

846
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:40,629
my formula is amazing like you're just

847
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,830
trying to lie for attention yeah I

848
00:28:40,629 --> 00:28:43,539
should have never done that and I

849
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:46,059
learned my lesson to really respect the

850
00:28:43,539 --> 00:28:47,830
customer listen to them but it's hard

851
00:28:46,059 --> 00:28:49,539
cuz we talked about being defensive and

852
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:52,269
like and I was it was new it was

853
00:28:49,539 --> 00:28:54,940
literally my like one of my long yeah

854
00:28:52,269 --> 00:28:56,649
first very first launch so to have it go

855
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:58,749
and have something go wrong it was

856
00:28:56,649 --> 00:29:00,759
devastating so I had to do my research

857
00:28:58,749 --> 00:29:02,049
and I had to really you know learn well

858
00:29:00,759 --> 00:29:03,610
I had this like whole likes Campbell

859
00:29:02,049 --> 00:29:05,830
thing happen I did definitely react

860
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:07,269
right away yeah annoyed by it and

861
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:09,129
there's been so many people being like

862
00:29:07,269 --> 00:29:10,059
oh my god he's never had a real job so

863
00:29:09,129 --> 00:29:11,860
he doesn't know how to talk to people

864
00:29:10,059 --> 00:29:13,330
every time we know I did work retail

865
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:15,639
beforehand I know how to talk to me -

866
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:20,019
yeah make you talk to people I things

867
00:29:15,639 --> 00:29:26,980
like I think huh oh my god first I raise

868
00:29:20,019 --> 00:29:28,210
my guard let's hack up I think that in

869
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:29,409
the social media days when it comes to

870
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:31,509
influencers there's a very very

871
00:29:29,409 --> 00:29:33,039
unrealistic expectation that influencers

872
00:29:31,509 --> 00:29:34,210
I don't have said like a lot of people

873
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,769
just think like oh we don't have

874
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:37,600
feelings and that we're all just gonna

875
00:29:35,769 --> 00:29:39,549
like if somebody's screaming in our face

876
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,629
we're just supposed to get over people

877
00:29:39,549 --> 00:29:41,980
we're selling Nirvana

878
00:29:40,629 --> 00:29:43,030
right we all really do have feelings

879
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:45,550
right if someone's

880
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:47,830
lying or like saying something I don't

881
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:49,120
know it's hot it's attached I really is

882
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:50,350

so excited by the greens and the purple

1008
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:34,410
because those colors do not happen in

1009
00:35:32,789 --> 00:35:36,150

1010
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:37,470
