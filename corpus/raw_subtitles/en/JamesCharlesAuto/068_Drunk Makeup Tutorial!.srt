me hi sisters James Charles here and

4
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,439
welcome back to my youtube channel I'm

5
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:27,000
guessing that you guys probably got the

6
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,840
notification for this video and thinking

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,969
what it's doing and trust me I'm sitting

8
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,530
here and I'm thinking the same exact

9
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:36,090
thing if you can suspend me for a while

10
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,620
on my social media platforms you've

11
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,989
heard me talk openly about the fact that

12
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,489
I do not drink alcohol is just not

13
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:42,570
really my thing on everyone to parties

14
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:44,969
in high school and I've just never

15
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,530
really felt the need to but that being

16
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:49,140
said today the day that I'm filming this

17
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,090
is May 23rd and if you know me it is my

18
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,879
birthday not only is my birthday okay

19
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,829
it's my 21st birthday which obviously is

20
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:57,750
the legal drinking age here and America

21
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:59,969
although I do not enjoy drinking I have

22
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,370
always said to myself that I want to try

23
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:04,229
it at least once a mile I just - you

24
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,240
don't feel the vibes see how it is

25
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:08,040
experience it see how I would act and

26
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,479
just see how it would feel overall and I

27
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,520
feel like if there's any time to try

28
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:13,770
drinking for the first time it's on my

29
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,869
21st birthday and I figured if I'm gonna

30
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:17,100
you know try out drinking I might as

31
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:18,210
well get some good content out of it

32
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,900
because this is probably not gonna

33
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,880
happen again

34
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,920

35
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,990

now I do want to make a very quick

40
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:48,040
disclaimer before we jump into this

41
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:49,630
video because I know my audience ranges

42
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,610
from very young kids all the way up to

43
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:53,620
parents in no way shape or form is this

44
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:54,790
video meant to promote alcoholism or

45
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:56,440
drinking if you guys know I have never

46
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:58,600
been an advocate for it I am the biggest

47
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:00,100
advocate and making smart choices if you

48
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,200
are one of my younger followers please

49
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,490
do not drink until you are of age and if

50
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,100
you're gonna drink please drink

51
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:07,240
responsibly and most importantly do not

52
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,770
get behind the wheel if you were

53
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:12,340
intoxicated and don't put anybody's

54
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:13,660
lives or your own in danger I can't do

55
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,130
