21
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,280
promise those things all have answers

22
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,239
and that is because today i am filming a

23
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,079
day in the life

24
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,520
video and i'm honestly really really

25
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,879
excited for it despite the fact that i

26
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,920
am starting so early i

27
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,600
have wanted to film this for a really

28
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,879
long time now because i personally love

29
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,239
watching other people's daily life

30
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,360
videos i think they're super super

31
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,199
interesting and i really want to show

32
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,359
you guys what like my daily work life

33
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,719
looks like obviously it's no secret that

34
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,320
the whole point of these videos

35
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,159
is to make the audience think that your

36
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,360
day is like crazy i feel like you guys

37
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,760
have definitely figured that out at this

38
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,040
point

39
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,320
like what am i gonna do okay film a day

40
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,920

[Music]

125
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,560
okay hi lewis hi luis good morning

126
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,400
now it is time to get started on my work

127
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,720
um i've been doing this for four years

128
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,159
now

129
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,840
i'm so grateful to have an incredible

130
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,599
team around me that helps with all other

131
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,519
aspects of videos but for some reason

132
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,799
i insist i'm doing the thumbnails still

133
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,560
every single time so

134
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,080
i'm going to just head into google drive

135
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,680
go into the beauty battle and then we

136
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,239
took some thumbnails i always go ahead

137
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,840
and look

138
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,799
through them i actually really like this

139
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,480
one that's a little bit uncomfortable

140
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,319
um a lot of these are really smiley but

141
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,159
i think this one was the one

142
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,360
yeah this feels like an actual battle so

143
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,200
i'm gonna go ahead and download

144
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,480
this one and then i'll show you guys my

145
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,519
thumbnail process

146
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,120
i don't really do too much the

147
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,720
thumbnails to be honest i feel like some

148
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,000
people like go crazy which is

149
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,680
more power to them that's just never

150
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,400
been like our you know video style we

151
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,840
usually just do

152
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,759
plain white backgrounds not a lot of

153
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,880
text or emojis or anything so

154
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,000
all right so i'm pretty sure that's done

155
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,360
at this point like i said super

156
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,040
simplistic all i did was just brighten

157
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,960
the colors desaturate the background do

158
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,199
some slight retouching on any blemishes

159
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,639
or

160
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,320
any reshaping that i like to do for my

161
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,759
head personally so that is pretty much

162
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,080

163
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,880

so let's go so that's why i feel like

391
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,160
that works really well in the carousel

392
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,600
i think you should do both though like i

393
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,200
think you should this moment though on

394
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,760
the carousel with orange should make the

395
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,959
outfit look

396
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:53,310
so much better um because i look good

397
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:58,150
like this

398
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:58,150
[Music]

399
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,560

and we're going to change in the car

404
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,079
because our photo location is apparently

405
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,279
right across the street according to mr

406
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,120
lewis who did the locations

407
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,720

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,450
and go take some

410
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:18,450

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,199
looks like chris jenner at 16.

419
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,639
let's do a few more squattings i want to

420
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:43,920

421
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,920
side profile once like we got glasses

422
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:49,040
oh yeah that's the best

423
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,360
we're getting changed in the middle of

424
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,360
the road currently

425
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,360
oh

426
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,199
maybe we're going to cut the camera for

427
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,920
this cut the camera we got into the new

428
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,680
outfit in

429
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,720
the car which was alarming considering

430
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,000
the amount of people that were staring

431
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,680
at me the entire time and walking

432
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,040
by see the problem is right now it looks

433
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,720
gorgeous but the sun

434
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,399
which is back here is not really like

435
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,040
out it's a very very cloudy day which is

436
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,639
definitely

437
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,320
good for some photography but not really

438
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,760
for makeup photography

439
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,839
so we're gonna try our best and see what

440
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,839
we can come up with

441
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,040
give us an arch give us a big arch

442
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,800
all right okay so we're back from the

443
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,399
photo shoot i just filmed three more

444
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,440
tick tocks and stockpiled for this week

445
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,480
which will be really good because we

446
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,240
have another busy week

447
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,440
up ahead with more filming stuff cassie

448
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,120
just got here ready for the party

449
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,040
tonight jesus is fully glam now i have

450
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,880
to decide what i actually want to

451
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,560
wear and look like for the party i was

452
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,760
thinking about wearing this like offer

453
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,760
that i haven't added a fun little like

454
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,639
pop of orange but i honestly feel like i

455
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,399
feel like i just like

456
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,760
need to do like natural which i honestly

457
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,199
love like i love that i've been

458
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,639
throwing less makeup and stuff so i'm

459
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,000
thinking that maybe like my more natural

460
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,000
moment should be just like a simple

461
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,680
outfit like sweat and a sweatshirt

462
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,199
instead of all this i don't know

463
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,199
you guys this is the finished fit for

464
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,240
larry's party tonight he literally just

465
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,440
texted in the group shot saying that

466
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,360
it's an all block party which

467
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,880
unfortunately eliminated my other outfit

468
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,360
but kind of made me go like that anyway

469
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,880

470
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,880
