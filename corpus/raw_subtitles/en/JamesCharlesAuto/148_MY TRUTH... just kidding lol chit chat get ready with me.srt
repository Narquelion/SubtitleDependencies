lamp resistivity so I just figured might

10
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,840
as well just be approved you could sit

11
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:34,079
and do anything if I don't do this very

12
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:38,070
often a lot of course applies now

13
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,570
moisturizer to begin with some touch a

14
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,059
water paint okay

15
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:44,789

21
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,460
really good things happened and I've

22
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:10,979
also had some really bad things happen

23
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:14,399
so emotionally I was down and I don't

24
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:20,060

25
00:01:14,399 --> 00:01:20,060
entire life and I'm so excited about it

26
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:29,009

122
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:18,810
not even knowing the caves adventure

123
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:20,819
right but the story doesn't end there

124
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:22,889
because we tried back to lower which is

125
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:25,229
like the 30 minutes waiting for cans and

126
00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:26,550
we walk into her permit and you guys

127
00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:28,409
have probably notices until the club

128
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:32,250
videos anymore remember on insert of why

129
00:06:28,409 --> 00:06:34,229
I can't believe sit still easily if I'm

130
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:36,449
sitting so I would be jiggling something

131
00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:38,729
will be playing something or like

132
00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:41,129
tapping something and for me one of the

133
00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:42,750
easiest things to play with are the two

134
00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:43,919
priests about me I'll sit there and I'll

135
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:46,199
spin them around and I'll jiggle around

136
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,879
as soon as it's go to Laura's house I'm

137
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:52,289
just sitting in a car for 30 minutes so

138
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:53,969
I need a little little jiggle to my

139
00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:56,400
breasts and guess what isn't there

140
00:06:53,969 --> 00:06:58,439
Mike's dollar party you just include

141
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,279
mail bracelet that has a knock off fly

142
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:03,599
off so I started crying

143
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:05,250
my god I literally just lost every slack

144
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,199
and okay let's figure it out let's find

145
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:09,000
it like Ron emission Nelson stars

146
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,219
so our first instinct of courses tool

147
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,009
injures car we go it's not there's a

148
00:07:11,219 --> 00:07:15,779
nice price ok let me show up hold here

149
00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:19,349
and there's never a time line I'm like

150
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:20,069
line that this actually happened luckily

151
00:07:19,349 --> 00:07:22,469
for me

152
00:07:20,069 --> 00:07:24,810
- had a twenty people take a photo with

153
00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:26,879
me at a public restaurant where migrants

154
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:28,469
are proudly showing bingo thank you

00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,060
sister she being the best so we start

156
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:31,830
running through the people and I not

157
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:34,639
thinking like okay into the fall once

158
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:34,639
it's like disappear

159
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:42,540

163
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:52,330
James is my friend if we use some of the

00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:53,080
similar techniques yeah cuz they're good

165
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:54,490

167
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:59,320
loving him in this world we need like

168

support love it like that because

169
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:56,920
everyone's really mean his side of the

170
00:08:52,900 --> 00:09:01,350
car the story the inspired winner to be

171
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,350
signing his half through the car window

172
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:09,250
is also bracelet that was super super

173
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:10,900
points mean did you know once the team

174
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:13,560
so I'm freaking out gonna figure what we

175
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:17,110
can do still looking for the photos and

176
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:21,090
about one girl outside of the restaurant

177
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:21,090
we did a full body photo I remember

178
00:09:55,379 --> 00:10:02,319
let's say hypothetically something with

179
00:10:00,129 --> 00:10:05,439
me I'm literally looking through the

180
00:10:02,319 --> 00:10:07,449
parking lot or the bracelet 30-minute

181
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:09,189
Dantes that would mean likes going me

182
00:10:07,449 --> 00:10:10,749
the ground wahoo the bronzing obviously

183
00:10:09,189 --> 00:10:13,299
all the parking lot and what was so

184
00:10:10,749 --> 00:10:14,799
sucks and that was a lot of people right

185
00:10:13,299 --> 00:10:17,110
near the parking spot of the where we've

186
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:18,790
ha I think you see it's a sprinkler that

187
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:21,459
looks like a nail and this one girl

188
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:24,970

we're finally alone fix them call Lauren

196
00:10:43,869 --> 00:10:46,179
obviously looking through our time

197
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:49,389
photos like waiting to see if anything

198
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:52,509
appears we posted me in her mom outside

199
00:10:49,389 --> 00:10:55,480
of the restaurant and if you zoomed in

200
00:10:52,509 --> 00:10:57,879
on my rest the race that was already not

201
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:00,100
there sound like great

202
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:03,129
what are just out there on face and burn

203
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:04,600
30 minutes and looking for Glee said

204
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:06,910
that literally was not even there

205
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,960
so that's grades I'm now thinking keeper

206
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:11,510
either loss a loss in the

207
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:13,520
it's literally like somewhere else and

208
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:15,260
all the sudden drew my best friend is

209
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,160
literally like James what you're

210
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:20,330
fighting with again

211
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,860
did your glasses fly off my no sister

212
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:30,529
eyes were in contact and using James

213
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:32,330
your bracelets at your house when you

214
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:34,310

215
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:36,250
glasses how the drugs wearing contacts

216
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:39,140
you think the race looked at your house

217
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:39,770
so we let me drive all the way home 40

218
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,300
minutes from Haines

219
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:42,920
there was somebody speeding down the

220
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:45,110
freeway we're all it was right on it

221
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:47,029

00:11:48,860 --> 00:12:00,320
sitting you're getting on my floor and

225
00:11:53,149 --> 00:12:02,990

hours the ballpark you based on you mean

227
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:06,770

233
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:20,959

you actually like the silent video I

don't do this very often but it is so

288
00:16:19,209 --> 00:16:22,389
much easier than just a regular style

289
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,920

293
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:28,750
opposite because I'm so busy working
