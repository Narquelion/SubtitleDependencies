the beginning of today's video to say a

8
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:16,619

00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:20,550
actually came out yesterday and I was

11
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,920
literally crying all day long I was such

12
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,050
a huge mess because of the reaction and

13
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,150
the comments that literally could not

14
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,220
have been more positive and I am so

15
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,630
incredibly grateful and I cannot wait

16
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,340

new instant influencer episode today but

31
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:00,510
I thought I'd be really cool for our

32
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:02,280
videos in between the episodes on

33
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,110
Tuesdays to do something in relation to

34
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,790
the last week's episode I thought it'd

35
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,110
be fun to discuss some comments and some

36
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,760
constructive criticism from you guys

37
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,560

38
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,119

click right up here and go watch it now

42
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:17,549
before watching today's video and just

43
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,750
overall spilling some tea about the show

44
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:20,280
and more information that you guys

45
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,049
didn't get to see from behind the scenes

46
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,220
in episode 1 all the contestants were

47
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:24,810
challenged with making a marketing

48
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,790
campaign video around a makeup product

49
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,930
that already exists in the industry a

50
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:29,340
lot of the videos were really really

51
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,439
cool up one of them that stuck out the

52
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,229
most me it was Palin's and she had a

53
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,479
beauty sponge as her item how to do your

54
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:38,040
full face with one tool in one tool only

55
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,090
the Real Techniques Beauty sponge of

56
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,740
course we all have a million Beauty

57
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,850
sponges we even used them every single

58
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,320
day when we're getting ready but I

59
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:45,060
really liked Kalin's video because she

60
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,799
interviewed her personality she really

61
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,930
made me want to buy the product and she

62
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,399
also had a theme for the video which was

63
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:51,899
using a Beauty Blender for your full

64
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,220
face of makeup

65
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:54,210
now obviously I'm pretty sure and

66
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,710
kaylynn's commercial she was only

67
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:57,149
talking about her base but when I was

68
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,770
watching her on the judging panel my

69
00:01:57,149 --> 00:01:59,909
gear start attorney and I was like oh my

70
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,960
god this would kind of be a fun

71
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:02,579
challenge but I hadn't at least seen

72
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,469
many people do so for today's video

73
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:06,329
inspired by a Miss Kailyn of brown at

74
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:07,830
the show I let a guy my Duty's funds

75
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:09,479
that I use on an everyday basis

76
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:11,760
and see if I can do my full face of

77
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,530
makeup using only a beauty blender while

78
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,990
filling some tea about the show let's

79
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:21,170
get started

80
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:22,550
[Music]

81
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:23,840
all right you guys say one thing the

82
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:25,400
comments section on the first episode

83
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,330
and when threw in screenshotted a ton of

84
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,100
different things that I want to talk

85
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:29,690
about in today's video but obviously we

86
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,560
do have a challenge to do in Kayla's

87
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,300
video she used the Real Techniques

88
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,830
sponge so in mine I'm gonna grab my

89
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,660
personal favorite which is from a Juna

90
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:37,160
1ko it's a microfiber one so it's really

91
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,810
kind of like fluffy and just applies

92
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,250
everything really really beautifully I'm

93
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:41,930
gonna grab my touch out water cream

94
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:44,570
which is my oyster Iser and start off

95
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:46,400
with some skincare using my sponge I've

96
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:48,620
actually never done this before but you

97
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,880
definitely can so we're just gonna I

98
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:52,550
guess grab some on there and to start

99
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,870
you know applying it to the face also

100
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:55,880
I'm aware that my face looks a little

101
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:57,709
bit crazy right now I promise as much as

102
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,540
it looks like it I did not go crazy with

103
00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:01,130
the blush unfortunately I fell asleep in

104
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:02,900
the Sun a few days ago and I forgot to

105
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:04,340
put on sunblock which is a major lesson

106
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:07,519
to you guys always wear sunscreen and I

107
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:09,680
got very burnt Oh Lois look at how that

108
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,000
looks on camera I have never had a sign

109
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,769
that hurts as much it literally was

110
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,820
painful just to put on their shirt today

111
00:03:12,769 --> 00:03:15,350
were filming this YouTube video so

112
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,670
please do not comment about my

113
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,030
foundation matching okay I'm gonna try

114
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:19,130
my best

115
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,900
I've been applying my Olivera just let

116
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:21,950
me be and wear your sunscreen always the

117
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,390
first comment that I want to address

118
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:24,980
while I'm doing up my foundation of my

119
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:26,750
yet beauty sponge is this one from Zee

120
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:28,010
mystery and they said I really

121
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,690
appreciate that it's free especially

122
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:31,459
during these times

123
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:39,380
now this comet makes me a berry oh I

124
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:39,650
forgot to call it cracked well too late

125
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,450
now

126
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:43,010
now this comet makes me very very happy

127
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:44,600
to hear because it was super important

128
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:46,280
to us that everybody was able to you

129
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,840
know watch the show and enjoy it for

130
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,370
free what's actually crazy though is

131
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,709
that we filmed the entire show in

132
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:54,049
January when Corona was not even a thing

133
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:55,970
here in America yet so our decision to

134
00:03:54,049 --> 00:03:57,350
make the show free literally nothing to

135
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:59,060
do with the parents out there it was

136
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:00,260
actually a goal of ours from day one and

137
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:02,209
when we were talking to our production

138
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,620
company and our partners for the show

139
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:04,970
which obviously ended up being a youtube

140
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,410
originals it was like literally a thing

141
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:08,030
that we negotiated inside we are not

142
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:09,350
doing this if it's not gonna be free so

143
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:10,579
we're very grateful that we were able to

144
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:12,500
make that happen so everybody could

145
00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:14,450
access it and we're even more grateful

146
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:16,070
that it is free during these really

147
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:18,890
really hard times because everyone stuck

148
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:19,910
at home it's fun enjoyable content and I

149
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:21,169
know you all have really important

150
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:23,510
things to spend your money on right now

151
00:04:21,169 --> 00:04:25,550
like bills and staying alive during this

152
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:26,800
awful awful awful time so I will say

153
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:28,419
that I really really

154
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,560
want to continue to do more high

155
00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:31,180
production content for free in the

156
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,110
future as well so fingers crossed they

157
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,500
were able to continue to make that

158
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:35,310
happen

159
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:39,849
the base is looking at gorgeous so far

160
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:42,879
is that cheating's I just cheap fix plus

161
00:04:39,849 --> 00:04:45,190
I just bring down my face I wasn't

162
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,419

163
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:48,310

168
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,930

00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:37,150
some like this for a very very long time

187
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:39,729
and as excited as I was to get started

188
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:40,990
on set I was very very nervous

189
00:05:39,729 --> 00:05:42,520
episode 1 and I don't really get nervous

190
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:43,750
really for anything I kind of go into

191
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,979
everything like ready to go but

192
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:47,409
obviously this was such a new experience

193
00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:48,759
for me and I was surrounded by industry

194
00:05:47,409 --> 00:05:49,990
professionals that were working on the

195
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:51,789
shelves the last thing that I wanted to

196
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:53,380
do was you know get on set and embarrass

197
00:05:51,789 --> 00:05:55,330
myself and how big to redo takes a

198
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,620
million times and of course we still had

199
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:58,210
every do quite a lot of things and get

200
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,620
you know good audio clips and video

201
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:01,029
clips of everything but as we really

202
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:03,909
started getting into filming even on

203
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:05,770
like day one I just felt so confident in

204
00:06:03,909 --> 00:06:07,659
it and really felt like this is what I'm

205
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:09,219
meant to be doing and if you guys

206
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:10,900
thought I was good in episode 1 it

207
00:06:09,219 --> 00:06:12,550
literally got way way way better by the

208
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,719
time of the finale so this means a lot

209
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:15,849
thank you for saying this thank you for

210
00:06:13,719 --> 00:06:18,340

followers on social media since

yesterday's premiere which is so so cool

234
00:06:56,429 --> 00:06:59,129
obviously that's the point of the show

235
00:06:57,689 --> 00:07:00,569
but at the end of the day though you

236
00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:02,039

237
00:07:00,569 --> 00:07:04,019

covergirl clean fresh clean the

covergirl clean fresh cream blush I

244
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:19,679
don't really love cream blushes or cream

245
00:07:17,789 --> 00:07:21,449
highlighters or liquid highlighters worn

246
00:07:19,679 --> 00:07:23,099
liquid blushes or really liquid anything

247
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:24,599
why would you say that like you boo me

248
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:26,249
it's such a like this duck summit comes

249
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:27,899
from Oliver and he says this is a great

250
00:07:26,249 --> 00:07:29,219
show thank you so much for someone who

251
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:31,079
is personally not really into makeup I

252
00:07:29,219 --> 00:07:32,550
enjoyed it so much it wasn't too long it

253
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:34,499
was exciting and the contestants are so

254
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:36,029
talented true I wish we could see the

255
00:07:34,499 --> 00:07:37,529
contestants talking while the judges

256
00:07:36,029 --> 00:07:38,909
deliberate thank you for leaving a

257
00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:41,249
constructive criticism in a really

258
00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:42,479
really cool way I love reading a start

259
00:07:41,249 --> 00:07:44,219
to criticism and seeing what you guys

260
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,360
want to see in the show it was actually

261
00:07:44,219 --> 00:07:46,860
kind of weird because we didn't plan on

262
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,029
filming anything of the contestants

263
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,529
while they were in that like holding

264
00:07:48,029 --> 00:07:51,089
room before going back to their video

265
00:07:49,529 --> 00:07:53,429
mobs mostly because we didn't really

266
00:07:51,089 --> 00:07:54,869
plan for that like to be a full set so

267
00:07:53,429 --> 00:07:56,610
that room literally looked awful on

268
00:07:54,869 --> 00:07:57,899
camera but once we got the footage back

269
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,129
that the contestants like talking to

270
00:07:57,899 --> 00:08:00,059
each other and like gossiping and

271
00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:02,009
talking about the judging and the

272
00:08:00,059 --> 00:08:03,300
challenges we were like oh this is gold

273
00:08:02,009 --> 00:08:04,619
like we have to include this in the show

274
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,209
which is why I love being there despite

275
00:08:04,619 --> 00:08:07,860
the fact that it looks you know not the

276
00:08:06,209 --> 00:08:09,419
best and we definitely longer do this

277
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,709
for season two and who knows it might

278
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:12,389
even end up being something that we post

279
00:08:10,709 --> 00:08:14,279
like on an insta influence or separate

280
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:15,779
Channel because that's like a lot of

281
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:16,949
really good side contact but I think you

282
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:18,509
guys would love to see as well so

283
00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:19,919
definitely us know and definitely keep

284
00:08:18,509 --> 00:08:21,689
us posted with more cultural criticism

285
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,889
and feedback we'd love to see it and we

286
00:08:21,689 --> 00:08:23,550
obviously want to make the show the best

287
00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:25,350
that it possibly

288
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:27,150
Hanabi so wednesday ina Thank You Oliver

289
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:29,370
for the suggestion okay there's hardly

290
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:30,510
time to set this base in place god bless

291
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:31,770
I don't want any more creases so I'm

292
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,720
just gonna grab my beauty sponge at once

293
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:35,970
again and dip right into my translucent

294
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:37,050
setting powder and we're going to lock

295
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:39,060
it in all right you guys that's pretty

296
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:40,200
much the base for now all completes and

297
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,760
of course the next step is going to be a

298
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,140
brows an eye shadow I'm gonna be

299
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,150
skipping my brows because I think they

300
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:46,260
look okay and there's just no way that

301
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:48,180
anything is gonna happen with the brows

302
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,320
I do want to try to do eyeshadow I'm

303
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,640
going to quickly go to the bathroom and

304
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,170
give at both of these Beauty blenders a

305
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,820
quick little cleaning because they're

306
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:56,280
very very dirty but I'll be right back

307
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,840
zoomed in to try to create a look okay

308
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,580
so for eyeshadow today I do have some

309
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,930
cream shadows that I found in my

310
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,340
collection I have never actually used

311
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:03,810
these before I've never even used a

312
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:05,610
cream eyeshadow if I'm gonna be honest I

313
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:07,620
don't have high hopes for this but I'm

314
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:08,520
just gonna try it out and see where

315
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,900
things go

316
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,040
okay so Long's really got this eye

317
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,870
shadow I wanted to talk a little bit

318
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,410
about the judges in the episode and what

319
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:18,360
you guys have thought about that this

320
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:20,010
card from abuse s says Paris is well

321
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,990
Abdul James is Randy Jackson and or

322
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:23,370
veena is Simon Cowell this comment

323
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:24,540
definitely gave me a cute little giggle

324
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:27,510
yesterday because if you're an original

325
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:28,770
American Idol fan you know oh geez Paris

326
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:30,450
obviously came in and was super super

327
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:31,410
nice to the contestants which made sense

328
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,790
because usually when you're a guest

329
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:34,650
judge on the show that's like the role

330
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:36,360
that that person fills and then I

331
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:37,740
obviously as the host was kind of like I

332
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,910
wouldn't say like neutral because I

333
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,740
definitely gave quite a lot of criticism

334
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:42,780
so I tried to match like all of my

335
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,980
criticism with a positive as well so

336
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,090
that way the contestants are able to you

337
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,890
know use that information to their

338
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:47,520
advantage if they make it on to the next

339
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,570
challenge

340
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,490
and then obviously at noir veena is

341
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:52,110
there and she gave quite a lot of you

342
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,310
know more serious critiques and there

343
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:54,900
was quite a lot of comments about it

344
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:56,010
glossy fox said it the face of novena

345
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:58,260
makes are killing me

346
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:59,430
Ariana Guzman said I love nor Venus

347
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,830
Christian show criticism she really

348
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:03,750
knows what she's doing yes I would 1000%

349
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:05,010
have to agree nor veena is one of you

350
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:07,350
know my closest friends in the industry

351
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:08,550
but she's also you know the creative

352
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:10,320
director and a leader of a

353
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:12,300
billion-dollar makeup brand that all of

354
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,800
us know and love so honestly for me it

355
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:16,320
was like a no-brainer to ask taormina to

356
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,180
be on the show nor Vina brings so many

357
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,950
really really strong critiques and

358
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:21,180
knowledge to these contestants from what

359
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:22,060
she's learned from working the industry

360
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:24,220
for the past several

361
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:25,780
and it's really really good I love her

362
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:27,370
because she's so brutally honest but

363
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:28,570
sometimes later in this industry you

364
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:29,800
really need to hear that because it's

365
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:31,210
those cupboards that can really take you

366
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,320
to the next level if you take in that

367
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:34,840
information and use it to your advantage

368
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:44,290
instead of taking it to heart this looks

369
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:45,490
terrible oh this is a bad choice okay

370
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:46,690
you guys I'm just gonna stop here on the

371
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:48,250
eyeshadow and move on to the rest of the

372
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:50,020
face to finish off this challenge I knew

373
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:52,030
this is a bad idea okay I called it

374
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:53,410
there's the footage exists I never even

375
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:55,300
used a cream eyeshadow if I'm gonna be

376
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:57,250
honest I don't have high hopes for this

377
00:10:55,300 --> 00:11:00,520
and it definitely was I don't think it

378
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:02,830
looks awful but yeah I definitely prefer

379
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,970
my morphe brushes heyday of the week to

380
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:05,260
Beauty Blender all right you guys so

381
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:06,880
while we work on finishing up this look

382
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:08,590
and finishing up this challenge I want

383
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,480
to talk about probably the thing that

384
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:12,670
has been most controversial or comments

385
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,560
about since episode one and that is the

386
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:16,000
elimination also once again if you have

387
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,470
not seen the episode please like right

388
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,240
up here because spoiler alerts are

389
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:20,860
coming right now and I don't wanna ruin

390
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,510
it if you guys want to watch it Academy

391
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:24,070
does mess I'm a huge fan of how the

392
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:25,420
elimination is set up it's not made to

393
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:27,040
embarrass the person that is being sent

394
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:28,360
home James tells you personally it you

395
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,890
two are alone and he encourages you to

396
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,060
keep doing YouTube videos James have you

397
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:33,130
read this you're doing a great great job

398
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:34,510
thank you so much Ekaterina Richard why

399
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:35,620
he just says the ending is a bit weird

400
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,820
and the girl is so emotional but

401
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,440
suddenly having to draw her YouTube

402
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,790
channel wall she's about to cry Leah

403
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,900
says everyone's like no Paris but James

404
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:43,480
was so nice to Britney when she was

405
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:45,100
eliminated I cried oMG alright so I'm

406
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,570
going to highlight using my morphe cream

407
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,280
highlighting second the number Effect

408
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:50,080
one no matter what reality show you're

409
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,460
watching the eliminations are always a

410
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,960
little bit controversial because of

411
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,070
course everybody has you know they're

412
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,870
different favorites everybody has

413
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:57,430
different beliefs as to you know who did

414
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:58,810
best in what challenges who should have

415
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:00,520
what home who should have stayed etc etc

416
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:02,170
originally we did actually have it

417
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,820
planned to do the eliminations kind of

418
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:05,440
in like the typical reality style format

419
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:07,600
where we just tell you know the winner

420
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,610
and the loser in the judging room but

421
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,560
since this is like a influencer slash

422
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:12,940
like content creation based show we

423
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,160
thought it would be kind of cool to tie

424
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,480
and elimination with that whole theme

425
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,970
and we came up with the idea of doing

426
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,080
the video lab elimination I personally

427
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:21,340
really really liked how they turned out

428
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,720
because obviously it's good

429
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:24,340
entertainment and that is the point of

430
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,080
creating a show also further points the

431
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:27,400
account arena brought up which is one

432
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,080
it's much more personal just send

433
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,430
somebody home

434
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,020
because you actually get to sit down and

435
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:32,040
talk to them face-to-face to hold her

436
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,390
hand to hug them to make sure that

437
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,980
they're good but also to give them a

438
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:36,930
constructive criticism and feedback for

439
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:38,910
one last time of what they can do to you

440
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:40,740
know better themselves in their career

441
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:43,110
moving forward nothing it's like

442
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:45,600
embarrassing but I would prefer to be

443
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:46,920
eliminated in private and not in front

444
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,530
of all my cast mates who happen to do

445
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:51,420
better I guess it's just because like I

446
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:53,040
don't like that type of confrontation um

447
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:55,110
so I really do it worked out

448
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,850
obviously yes Brittany was very very

449
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:58,020
emotional being sent home and yeah sure

450
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:59,190
I guess it's fair to say that it may

451
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:01,140
have been a little bit awkward to launch

452
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:03,360
Brittany you know cry and have to prohm

453
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:05,100
or herself on camera but first of all

454
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,450
it's better to promo yourself all crying

455
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,650
that I'm probably herself at all and

456
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:09,240
that's the whole point of the show is to

457
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:10,620
give it smaller artist platforms that I

458
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,940
think really really deserve it and we

459
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:13,950
almost wanted to bring it like a full

460
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:15,600
circle and tie it back to being an

461
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:17,310
actual influencer and filming a YouTube

462
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,020
video obviously it's an episode of a

463
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:20,850
show which is not exactly the same thing

464
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:22,500
but you guys are used to seeing me at

465
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:24,270
the end of all my videos sign-off and

466
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,470
you know do my little promo and get you

467
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,580
guys to follow the other socials and

468
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:28,500
that's the last thing that you guys get

469
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:29,700
to see of me on all my content so we

470
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,140
thought it'd be really cool to give it

471
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,820
the artists who do get sent home one

472
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:35,220
last opportunity to shine to plug

473
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:37,380
themselves and to you know make the last

474
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:38,520
impression before going home I'll write

475
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,690
you guys the only thing I'm missing left

476
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,160
in this look is going to be at the lips

477
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:42,720
so I'm gonna grab that crema covergirl

478
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,430
blush once again that I use on my cheeks

479
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,590
and just a little bit of that on the

480
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:48,570
back to my hand and I'm going to use my

481
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:50,010
mini Beauty Blender to finish off the

482
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:51,540
slock I just applied some mascara off

483
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:53,340
camera because let's be real this look

484
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,930
was looking a little bit busted without

485
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:56,760
it and I thought the lips are data that

486
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:59,160
is this full face using only a Beauty

487
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:00,570
Blender all complete you guys I had up

488
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,800
so much fun at doing this challenge

489
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:03,210
tonight and also addressing some

490
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,280
comments and questions that you guys had

491
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:06,840
about the show I hope I answered some

492
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,310
questions and further clarify it at some

493
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,720
things as much as putting this look

494
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:10,950
together was a little bit of a mess I

495
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,810
honestly don't really think it came out

496
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:14,340
that bad and I am obsessed I think this

497
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:16,080
looks so beautiful especially using the

498
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:17,130
cream blush and cream highlighter to I

499
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,660
was on the biggest fan of them but

500
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:20,340
honestly I might want to use them a

501
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:22,530
little bit more often at the eyes on the

502
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:24,960
other hand I wanted to try it out okay

503
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:26,550
it was definitely a fail but and then a

504
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,540
