00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,380
putting call videos I was literally the

10
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,850
kid growing up that like would actually

11
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,960
start freaking out if like one of the

12
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,430

13
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,480
teacher or started talking back or like

14
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,929

16
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:33,570
