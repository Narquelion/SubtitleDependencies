00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,659

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:05,069
welcome back to my youtube channel today

3
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:06,660
we're in the studio I made my little

4
00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:08,790
sister's a bathrobe available now and

5
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,349
sisters Esther Perel calm and of course

6
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,490
is going to be getting ready but for

7
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:13,139
today today I wanted to do something a

8
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,219
little bit different if you've been

9
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:15,990
watching my channel for a while it is

10
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:17,609
definitely no secret let's be real hope

11
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,140
that I had my holy grail beauty products

12
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:20,189
that I pretty much use all the time I

13
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,840
definitely get a lot of comments about

14
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:22,980
it people ask me to use new things and

15
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,660
I'm not even gonna lie to you guys at

16
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,130
this point I'm honestly getting a little

17
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,660
bit bored too I want to switch it up I

18
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,340
want to try out some new things and I

19
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,439
figured out a really fun way to do that

20
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,690
we'll be testing celebrity makeup hacks

21
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,670
now so my favorite videos in the entire

22
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,140
world are the vogue beauty secrets

23
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,550
series I'm sure you guys have seen them

24
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,079
in your recommended feed on your YouTube

25
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,850
homepage they always pop up for me and I

26
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,500
have watched so many them and personally

27
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,579
I really really love the vogue beauty

28
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,010
secrets videos because they're kind of

29
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,300
like a fun chill intimate inside look

30
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,530
into what the glamour routines of these

31
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,660
celebrities look like on an actual

32
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,800
everyday basis obviously over the course

33
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,120
of their careers they are used to

34
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,680
sitting in a glam chair and working with

35
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,390
different artists so from doing that

36
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,859
they obviously pick up a lot of tips and

37
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,120
tricks and wealth of knowledge from all

38
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:01,710
these artists and it's really cool to

39
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,059
see it what they picked up and also what

40
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,470
they've implemented into their daily

41
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:05,880
routines if that really works for them

42
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,409
so last night I was bench watching a ton

43
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,760
of the videos I took notes on a bunch of

44
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:10,439
my favorite tips and checks froy they

45
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,640
were celebrities I got in my bathrobe I

46
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:13,080
did try to film this video in my

47
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,159
bathroom I thought it'd be so much cuter

48
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,210
but I could not figure out how to get

49
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,619
the lighting and the camera angle all

50
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,180
correct if anybody works at Vogue and

51
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:20,759
wants to inform me so we can do a part

52
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,049

00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:36,240
all right defense before you even put on

59
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,070
a stitch of makeup skincare is super

60
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,420
super important obviously Asda probably

61
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,100
my favorite video of the entire series

62
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,869
is from an 80s supermodel named joan

63
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,759
severance I love her video because she

64
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:46,439
is so happy and so upbeat and she talks

65
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:47,700
about all different age defying a beauty

66
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,960
secrets she just says that she wants to

67
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,729

68
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,950

69
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:54,360
supermodel clearly she knows good tips

70
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,130
and techniques and even though I'm only

71
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,570
20 I would love to look like her when I

72
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:00,000
get older so I'm gonna test out her

73
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:02,159

74
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,560

00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:24,000
like this on a daily basis this looks so

83
00:02:22,049 --> 00:02:25,380
freaking cool it literally looks like

84
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,299
those Instagram filters that has like

85
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,560
the okay then it's lower there's a

86
00:02:27,299 --> 00:02:29,640
little bit of bulk filter that has the

87
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,650
Bogue logo above your head with your

88
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,660
skin like this it's meant to be in this

89
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:41,840
vogue video okay that's everything

90
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:41,840
oh yes oh wow this is good big chunk

91
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:45,870
this is it that I heard thing that I've

92
00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:49,769
ever done

93
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:51,390
oh that looks so nasty wow that was so

94
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:52,650
good I'm gonna quickly wash my face with

95
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:54,239
water to get off any excess and we're

96
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:55,470
gonna move on to the next step all right

97
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,880
okay so my next type is just going to be

98
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,170
applying some moisturizer and today I'm

99
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,569
using the old Hendricks in @ci

100
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:01,769
frightening at gel cream I love this one

101
00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:04,109
and I did a campaign to them a few

102
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:06,269
months ago I'm never losing it her sense

103
00:03:04,109 --> 00:03:07,440
it isn't bomb health and the next step

104
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:09,750
is going to be from one of my favorite

105
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,660
models in the entire world Ashley Graham

106
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:16,650
now in her video after she puts on her a

107
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:18,299
moisturizer she uses a roller to roll

108
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:19,680
her skin in I'm gonna be honest with you

109
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:21,090
guys I've literally never used one of

110
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,350
these before in my entire life I think

111
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,510
even Ashley in her video is like

112
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:26,400
sometimes I wonder why I are rolling my

113
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:27,930
face sometimes I wonder why I'm rolling

114
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,130
too but basically it gets the blood

115
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:30,170
flowing throughout your face that helps

116
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:31,849
deep up everything because

117
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:32,810
like a lymphatic massage our state's

118
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:35,450
pains that really really well so I'm

119
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:36,800
just going to go ahead and get deep

120
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:38,569
huffing you know you see all these

121
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,400
people rolling all the time you wonder

122
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:42,380
why they're rolling sometimes I wonder

123
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,660
why I'm rolling too but I know it's for

124
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:47,090
the contour it's for the deep huffing

125
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:48,230
and my skin nice and tight already best

126
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,850
another why skin prep is all done

127
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:52,700
normally next I'd go to the foundation

128
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:53,930
but almost literally every single person

129
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,970
that filmed one of these videos did

130
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:57,410
their eyebrows first which if you know

131
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:59,420
me you would know is not exactly my

132
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:00,530
personal favorite technique I just

133
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,730
really like to have my full base on and

134
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,870
then put the eyebrows overtop because I

135
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:04,250
feel like it's so hard to just carve

136
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:06,500
them out and just get everything around

137
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:07,580
them but that being said there's no it

138
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,590
specific way that you have to do makeup

139
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,310
so I'm gonna try it for today and we're

140
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:13,400
gonna see how it goes

141
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:20,630
fingers crossed first I start with my

142
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:22,550
brows I never used to be good at brows

143
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:26,750
Jordan was always like used to do my

144
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:30,320
brows I conceal right underneath to

145
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:32,210
shape the brow and then I actually hmm

146
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,290
well alright okay so the eyebrows are

147
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:36,080
both odd and I would do that there

148
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:37,850
looking like okay I honestly will say I

149
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,010
do like how they don't look as like

150
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:41,150
intense and bold because the fact that

151
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:42,289
there's no like foundation in powder and

152
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,760
everything underneath them so it's

153
00:04:42,289 --> 00:04:45,890
really just like my skin and the hair

154
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,240
which looks really good but I did have a

155
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:48,530
lot of trouble getting them even without

156
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,450
kind of like the rest my face to work

157
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:51,740
off of so I'm not sure maybe I'll

158
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:53,600
practice this technique more in the

159
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,800
future but regardless let's go ahead and

160
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,660
move on to our next step which is

161
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,310
finally going to be our foundation and

162
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:00,200
this next tab keeping in the Kardashian

163
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:02,690
family is from Courtney and she applies

164
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,280
her foundation with her hand now this

165
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:05,720
tip may seem a little bit crazy for

166
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,280
those of you guys who are like me it's a

167
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,660
group with beauty gurus and have Beauty

168
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,070
blenders and morphe Beauty sponges and

169
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:11,870
literally everything in between

170
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:13,220
but the reality is is that a lot of

171
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:14,900
people use at their hands for their

172
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:16,610
foundation and a lot of celebrity makeup

173
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,020
artists swear by using their fingers in

174
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:19,310
their hands because the natural heat of

175
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,690
the body does a really good job of kind

176
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:22,460
of blending everything in and making it

177
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:24,950
look smooth I don't like doing this

178
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:27,350
because I have a very very weird like

179
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:28,669
phobia of getting makeup on my fingers

180
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:30,620
and nails I don't know what it is I

181
00:05:28,669 --> 00:05:31,830
literally keep makeup wipes right next

182
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,930
to me at all times and I clean

183
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:35,070
my hands so often I'll do my makeup and

184
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:36,930
my little bit crazy or does everybody

185
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:38,340
else do this like I just do not like the

186
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:39,600
feeling of having makeup on my fingers

187
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,160
and just makes me feel like the process

188
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,120
is in a dirty and phimka gross that my

189
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,770
nails are good we're gonna do it today

190
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,300
an honor of sister Courtney it might

191
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:48,030
work out but I don't have any complaints

192
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:52,440
I'm ready to clean up after I apply this

193
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:58,650
with my hands I also do my skin before

194
00:05:52,440 --> 00:06:02,100
my eyes I think I told Kendall about

195
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:03,330
this too using my hands first of all was

196
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,800
not as nasty as I thought it was going

197
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:06,300
to be I just clean it afterwards and I

198
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,820
was completely fine at the nails are all

199
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,530
good and I did not freak out and I will

200
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,510
admit that using my hands that kind of

201
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:13,710
low-key Heike made me feel like one of

202
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:15,000
those supermodels that just like rubs

203
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:16,470
everything on and gets clam in five

204
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,030
minutes and somehow it looks really chic

205
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:21,180
like it does look very very beautiful

206
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:22,560
but sees my fingers took way way longer

207
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,030
than it does when you think it's fun so

208
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,500
who knows I might use this again in the

209
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:27,900
future and I'm on a time crunch though

210
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,340
absolutely not but that being said to

211
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,140
each their own and now I decide to move

212
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:33,150
on to the next step and that is from

213
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:36,000
Taylor hill and normally my next MOV

214
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:38,400
concealer but Taylor hill likes to use a

215
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,350
powder brush and set pretty much her

216
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,480
entire face with a little bit of powder

217
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:43,500
before her concealer now as you guys

218
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,880
know they're obviously no rules to

219
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,700
makeup but kind of one of the more

220
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,200
unspoken suggestions is that it's not

221
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,430
really great to put creams or liquids

222
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,960
overtop of powder because they don't

223
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:53,400
waste much well without being sad if

224
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,810
it's working for we're gonna test it out

225
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,760
today that is the beauty of this video

226
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:59,550
so I'm just gonna grab my little setting

227
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:02,190
powder mixture and a fluffy brush and

228
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:06,960
I'm just going to lightly set my face

229
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:11,370
and please next I'm just gonna use a

230
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:16,380
little bit of powder I put powder all

231
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:18,780
over my face next is concealer sometimes

232
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:21,210
I use brushes but for the most part like

233
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:23,370
if it's more natural the makeup I like

234
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:26,010
to use my hands because I feel like it

235
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:28,770
blends the product better I mean that

236
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:30,720
worked really well cool I am pleasantly

237
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:32,250
surprised with the result of Miss Taylor

238
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,570
Hills a technique I think my skin is

239
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,279
looking a beautiful to concealer blend

240
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:36,499
it out to one

241
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:37,579
and I am loving this so far that being

242
00:07:36,499 --> 00:07:39,049
said that my face is looking a little

243
00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:40,789
bit flat and I am definitely ready to

244
00:07:39,049 --> 00:07:42,439
add in some more dimension with some

245
00:07:40,789 --> 00:07:42,739
contour today I'm gonna be following it

246
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:45,139
tonight

247
00:07:42,739 --> 00:07:46,189
EKOS fun fact a few weeks ago on Twitter

248
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:47,749
I tweeted her thing she was beautiful

249
00:07:46,189 --> 00:07:49,159
and to your pilot said that I was also

250
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:50,299
beautiful and I was very excited about

251
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:51,889
it so I think it's safe to say we're

252
00:07:50,299 --> 00:07:53,119
both fans of each other which is kind of

253
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:54,709
everything I'm just gonna grab my normal

254
00:07:53,119 --> 00:07:56,869
contouring I'm brush and dip into my

255
00:07:54,709 --> 00:07:58,369
narwhal contour shade at least for the

256
00:07:56,869 --> 00:08:01,639
cheekbones and forehead portion but I'm

257
00:07:58,369 --> 00:08:04,759
gonna go soft kind of to it I like to

258
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:06,529
just follow my natural curves for her

259
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:08,119
contour differentiates on her nose

260
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:09,739
contour instead of tonight doing a

261
00:08:08,119 --> 00:08:12,019
superest notched nose like I personally

262
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:13,279
her fur she actually contours like a

263
00:08:12,019 --> 00:08:15,319
little ball on the tip of her nose and

264
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:17,029
gives that like that button look which I

265
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:19,339
actually already have I normally try to

266
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:21,499
hide it so let's try it out for my nose

267
00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:25,009
I like to create like a little button

268
00:08:21,499 --> 00:08:27,009
no do a little circle at the point at

269
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:30,799
the I don't know whatever that's hot

270
00:08:27,009 --> 00:08:33,680
then I use my finger and I go right here

271
00:08:30,799 --> 00:08:34,969
to give it like a cute little all right

272
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:39,139
you guys said this next up comes from

273
00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:42,979
Emily radda radda chomsky right at

274
00:08:39,139 --> 00:08:44,240
akatsuki Hirata - I don't want to get

275
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:45,529
dried from restaurants in her last name

276
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,910
her Instagram was Amerada she's a

277
00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:49,160
beautiful supermodel and this is her

278
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:50,750
five-minute date night look now at

279
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,250
Emily's video she used a cream a

280
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,480
highlighting stick pretty much like all

281
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:55,009
over her face TIFF I'm going to be

282
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,379
honest I don't think this technique

283
00:08:55,009 --> 00:08:59,269
would really work for a lot of people

284
00:08:57,379 --> 00:09:01,129
who don't look perfect like her for

285
00:08:59,269 --> 00:09:02,899
example media but I'm definitely down to

286
00:09:01,129 --> 00:09:04,490
try this out and see what ends up

287
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:07,550
looking like a little bit of highlighter

288
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:09,970
I just take the stick a little bit on

289
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:18,489
the nose put on my lip

290
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:20,349
into the eye yeah and realizing that my

291
00:09:18,489 --> 00:09:22,299
skin looks so pretty I'm not a sweetie

292
00:09:20,349 --> 00:09:23,079
I'm so sorry that I doubted you even for

293
00:09:22,299 --> 00:09:25,059
a moment

294
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:26,319
like what first Shore going to be using

295
00:09:25,059 --> 00:09:28,179
this technique in the future I don't

296
00:09:26,319 --> 00:09:29,679
think this technique would really work

297
00:09:28,179 --> 00:09:31,569
okay so the next time is going to be of

298
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:33,669
course I showed up unfortunately not

299
00:09:31,569 --> 00:09:35,409
many of the celebrities actually put on

300
00:09:33,669 --> 00:09:37,869
eye shadow looks in their videos which

301
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:39,909
definitely sucks so one trick that a lot

302
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:41,859
of people did use however is using their

303
00:09:39,909 --> 00:09:43,329
bronze are in contour to really chisel

304
00:09:41,859 --> 00:09:44,499
out of their eyelids which I actually do

305
00:09:43,329 --> 00:09:46,599
all the time when it comes to my

306
00:09:44,499 --> 00:09:48,789
everyday glam so we're going to do that

307
00:09:46,599 --> 00:09:51,039
inspired by a kendall Jenner I learn a

308
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:54,999
lot from being on set I usually just

309
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:56,199
take my bronzer and do it by phone I may

310
00:09:54,999 --> 00:09:58,329
have like a little bit crazy

311
00:09:56,199 --> 00:09:59,709
using the brush hair on my eyelid look I

312
00:09:58,329 --> 00:10:01,689
am just not used to this whole natural

313
00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:03,009
glam type of situation but this does

314
00:10:01,689 --> 00:10:04,299
gonna show that using a few different

315
00:10:03,009 --> 00:10:06,009
shades of brown can create a really

316
00:10:04,299 --> 00:10:06,759
really stunning I look even if it is it

317
00:10:06,009 --> 00:10:08,229
very simplistic

318
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:09,189
and I think this looks gorgeous we're

319
00:10:08,229 --> 00:10:11,109
about to move on to our next step which

320
00:10:09,189 --> 00:10:12,729
is going to be eyeliner well my favorite

321
00:10:11,109 --> 00:10:14,859
people of all time elect said to me at

322
00:10:12,729 --> 00:10:16,599
from a euphoria did her book video and

323
00:10:14,859 --> 00:10:18,339
she's like taste like my style icon

324
00:10:16,599 --> 00:10:20,229
right now and she did a very very

325
00:10:18,339 --> 00:10:21,999
beautiful block wing on both the outside

326
00:10:20,229 --> 00:10:23,619
and inside of her eyes so I'm gonna

327
00:10:21,999 --> 00:10:27,519
follow her techniques today so I see

328
00:10:23,619 --> 00:10:33,009
this Pat McGrath pen I start at the on

329
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:37,239
the outer I like a really like pointed

330
00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:40,500
so I kind of just start like that and

331
00:10:37,239 --> 00:10:44,580
then I always get a q-tip and

332
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:48,790
[Music]

333
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:50,470
no that is a fail okay this is the first

334
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:51,670
step so far that has been a fail oh it

335
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:52,900
sucks to say what this is the first

336
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:55,120
technique of this video that did

337
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:56,560
absolutely not work for me putting on

338
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,910
the winged liner it was super easy but I

339
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,290
did kind of mess up a little bit and I

340
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:01,840
wanted to follow Alexus technique of

341
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:04,900
kind of licking a cotton swab a cotton

342
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:06,370
swab if you are a fast refresh watch I

343
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,960
tried it sucking on the q-tip cleaning

344
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:09,940
up eyeliner to fix it all did was just

345
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,800
drag the actual ink like everywhere it

346
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:13,300
did not look at it from nation I had to

347
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,710
go back and conceal any way to fix it up

348
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,420
so definitely will not be trying that

349
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:17,470
one again regardless Alexa looks

350
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,940
beautiful I really love this winged

351
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:20,320
liner and the inner corner points I

352
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,520
really like this technique and might try

353
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,440
this more often because it very much

354
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:25,870
gives you that like snatched pull back

355
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,820
feline cat table book which I'm done for

356
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:29,200
any day of the week but that being said

357
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:31,090
that is pretty much this I look all

358
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,290
complete super simple super cute I'm

359
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:33,820
gonna go in and do the mascara and

360
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:35,470
lashes off camera because everyone is

361
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:37,480
pretty much dead regular lashes mascara

362
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:39,100
I'll be right back to continue on with

363
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,510
these tips and tricks so that this point

364
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:42,250
the look is pretty much almost complete

365
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:44,620
we only have the lips left and it is

366
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:45,970
still looking at so beautiful now before

367
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,680
I actually gonna put on any lip products

368
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:49,830
I want to take one tip from Josefina

369
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:52,990
scrubber who's a Victoria's Secret model

370
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:54,520
huh she's still beautiful and that is to

371
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:56,110
scrub your lips with a tooth brush

372
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,520
before actually putting on a lip product

373
00:11:56,110 --> 00:12:00,460
to exfoliate get rid of any of those

374
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:03,220
disgusting Krusty's and also plum I love

375
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:05,320
to brush my lips it was always a little

376
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:08,320
bit of a dead skin on them and it makes

377
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,940
them swallow a little bit more okay my

378
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,950
lips are definitely tingly I don't know

379
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:14,260
it's actually being a plunked but this

380
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:15,490
toothbrush is very very like dense so it

381
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:17,320
like definitely did a good job look like

382
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:19,000
roughening up Phillips it did do its job

383
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,560
of exfoliating it I honestly might

384
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,940
continue to use this for me whenever I'm

385
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,560
actually doing my makeup routine I

386
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:26,050
always it wait to brush my teeth until

387
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:27,339
right before I do my lipstick so if I am

388
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:28,420
doing my makeup routine next time and I

389
00:12:27,339 --> 00:12:29,800
go into the bathroom to wash my teeth

390
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:33,280
before doing lipstick maybe I'll go

391
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:34,720
ahead and brush my lips beforehand kind

392
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,250
of fun now for lips I took one more

393
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,480
check from Ashley Graham's video but

394
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,010
before she actually goes in with the

395
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,200
lips she actually takes a dark brown

396
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:44,020
eyeliner pencil and re like dark and

397
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,220
slash shades in her moles to accentuate

398
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,780
them which i think is super super cool

399
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,310
obviously you guys seen my face without

400
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,510
makeup on and I have quite a lot of

401
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,300
moles all around so I'm not really sure

402
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:53,690
how this is going to

403
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:55,600
but I'm gonna try it now I also like to

404
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:58,670
color in there's this like amazing

405
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:01,670
eyeliner and I don't use it on my eyes I

406
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:08,900
use it on my mole I love to color in my

407
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:12,830
malls and make them darker oh no oh no

408
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:15,290
this was a just did a bad thing

409
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:16,970
this is that's the Little Dipper oh my

410
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:18,770
god it looked so cute when Ashley did it

411
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:20,330
why does it look so stupid on me

412
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:22,190
first of all I feel like I use a shade

413
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:23,510
that was definitely too dark like her

414
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:24,710
looks nice and cute and natural like it

415
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:26,210
still kind of poke into the foundation

416
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:28,700
this looks like literal connect the dots

417
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:30,170
like this is not okay I'm gonna cheat

418
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,490
the system a little bit and grab some

419
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:37,190
test powder and kind of fix this because

420
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:38,630
this is bad well not what I will

421
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:40,370
definitely not be doing again I think

422
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:42,620
this is a good learning lesson that

423
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:45,380
everything can be okay in moderation and

424
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:46,940
this was not moderated I should have

425
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:48,470
used the later brown brow pencil first

426
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:49,820
or I should not have done all of my

427
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:51,770
moles because this just looks billy

428
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,700
stupid that being said I think it looks

429
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:54,200
really cute on Ashley and I definitely

430
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,550
want to try this again be using a better

431
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,050
technique and kind of reaccelerating

432
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:58,340
them because I do love my moles never

433
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:59,630
leave before putting on our new lipstick

434
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,310
Ashley talked about using a brown

435
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,630
eyebrow pencil to lightly contour out

436
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:04,880
your lips before putting on a nude

437
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:08,300
lipstick overtop this is my eyebrow

438
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:15,290
pencil that I use for my lips and it

439
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:16,740
just kind of contours your lips they do

440
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:18,700
the rest of my finger

441
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:20,500
alright you go ahead with the lipstick

442
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:22,000
all odd and contoured things too miss

443
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:24,220
Ashley Graham I'm just gonna apply a

444
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,079
little bit of some setting it's ready to

445
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:27,610
lock this all in place and I think that

446
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:30,070
is this makeup tutorial and using all

447
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:41,410
celebrity and makeup hacks all complete

448
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:42,820
I had so much fun binge watching all

449
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:43,959
these boat videos last night and bed it

450
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,850
was literally 3:00 in the morning and I

451
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:48,040
wanted to get up and do a makeup look so

452
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:49,300
badly I was just feeling so inspired and

453
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,680
I think this is a really good way for me

454
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,360
to kind of break out of my shell stop

455
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,260
using the same products over and over

456
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,790

457
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:56,410
