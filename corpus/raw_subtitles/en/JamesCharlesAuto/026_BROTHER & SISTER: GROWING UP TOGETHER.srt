talking about childhood memories

9
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,929
we actually had probably the worst hell

10
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:37,320
had ever together yeah we hate each

11
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:41,489
other yeah like pretty bad now we're

12
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:43,649
closer kind of if you guys did not know

13
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:45,329
I have 18 and Ian is 16 so that is a two

14
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:46,469
year age difference and now it means

15
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:49,890
nothing but when we were younger

16
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:52,230
Oh two years goes a long way and

17
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,610
obviously I am loud and obnoxious in

18
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,340
that race get my way and Ian was always

19
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:57,449
quiet defi was like the good younger

20
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,949
brother like would always just beat down

21
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:02,280
for anything would always be like nice

22
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:03,840
kind could not relate I was honestly

23
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,549
nothing like a really huge bully

24
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,250
well we fought a lot and it was up

25
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:12,350
always my fault but it was usually my

26
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:16,170
apology would painfully hurt me well yes

27
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:17,909
but I remember there was one time we

28
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,530
were fighting about something at dinner

29
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:22,799
he was still staying in a high chair

30
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:26,009
everybody got so huge where I got up out

31
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,590
of my regular dining chair and I kicked

32
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:30,150
the leg of his high chair over and his

33
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,920
high chair fell back and we had a

34
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,350
radiator right behind our dinner table

35
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,490
and he caught his entire lip open and

36
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,200
sort of bleeding and had him to the

37
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,899
hospital

38
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:41,689

39
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:43,490

40
00:01:41,689 --> 00:01:45,979

44
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:56,000
to sound like I was some psychotic

45
00:01:49,969 --> 00:01:57,439

47
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,579
fighting keep chasing inside one time in

48
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:03,560
our old house and I remember I slammed

49
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:05,299
the front door so he couldn't get to me

50
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,860
and I stand his entire hand in the door

51
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:09,049
and he broke his fingers me heading to

52
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:11,620

00:02:09,049 --> 00:02:13,610
that that was yeah but you had a coming

54
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:16,400

NOT a rower in any way shape or form I

back to me right now

118
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:38,150
I had one reoccurring dream where I was

119
00:04:35,539 --> 00:04:39,470
on a Barbie cruise ship maybe it's all

120
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,910

with and do their hair of every single

122
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:46,220
day hello gay from day one and then they

123
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,560
would drive into like the city of

124
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:50,479
Manhattan and it would like plow through

125
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,030
the city and then I would get thrown

126
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:55,400
overboard from like a hundred two

127
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:56,990
hundred feet up in the air and die every

128
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,910
time that I had the dream it was so

132
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,979
thud and she came into the room and she

133
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:08,300
saw that I was lying on the floor so she
