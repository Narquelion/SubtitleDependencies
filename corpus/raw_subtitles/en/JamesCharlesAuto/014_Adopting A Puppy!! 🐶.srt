23
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,840
about this and planning this for

24
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:50,760
literally almost idea now I almost

25
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,890
actually adopted during a Christmas time

26
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,120
of last year but with the palette coming

27
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,590
out I knew I was gonna be traveling up

28
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,059
so much and I really wanted to wait for

29
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,590
my a kind of life and work schedule to

30
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:00,000
calm down a little bit to make sure that

31
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,590
I was able to give at the right amount

32
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,510
of love and attention to a popper

33
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:06,000
joining the family and we finally have a

34
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,950
few quiet months and it is the absolute

35
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,049
perfect time to start looking at

36
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,250
shelters and try to adopt a new member

37
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:12,270
into the family I've already been

38
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,400
through raising and training a puppy

39
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,409
once it is quite the challenge but I am

40
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,509
so excited and ready to do it again and

41
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:20,070
have him be a long time a family member

42
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:21,810
and a best friend here in the sister

43
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,250
household and hopefully you guys will

49
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,619

[Music]

54
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:45,640
originating your hair at the Los Angeles

55
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:48,340
County Animal Care Center about to go

56
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,509
look at some of the puffers we're on the

57
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:51,460
way upstate earlier this morning and we

58
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:52,630
called and they do have a few different

59
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:54,460
pups that we were very very interested

60
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:56,649
in and that could have an amazing home

61
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:58,450
with us at the house so we're going to

62
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:59,890
go and make the stop and hopefully get

63
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:00,939
to play with them a little bit obviously

64
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,810
we're gonna go in and see the dogs and

65
00:02:00,939 --> 00:02:03,100
we want to make sure that we have a

66
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:04,929
really good at connection and at the

67
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,939
puppies like us and trust us and that we

68
00:02:04,929 --> 00:02:08,619
like them and wanna cuddle indeed best

69
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:10,269
friends so hopefully we end up taking

70
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:11,650
your dog home today but if not obviously

71
00:02:10,269 --> 00:02:13,989
want to wait for the absolute perfect

72
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:15,730
match that'll be for us but who knows he

73
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:26,799
could be right here in the shelter and

74
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:30,780
I'm some fitted to go see so all the

75
00:02:26,799 --> 00:02:30,780
puppies that are actually all the same

76
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:39,810
and then I think that one's tiny where

77
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,620
that one's tight we'll see I warned

78
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:53,370
stick those in Hershey

79
00:02:40,620 --> 00:03:02,510
yeah Big Momma we call all Don's mommies

80
00:02:53,370 --> 00:03:04,889
no ID why we started with our dog yeah

81
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:06,480
and like Oh your other people call their

82
00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:07,439
dogs but your 20 Stefan calls his dog

83
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,700
vomit yeah

84
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:11,060
we have no idea where they started from

85
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,060
but

86
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:30,230
I don't know why I'm really feeling this

87
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,189
alright you guys see this - oh the

88
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,569
little poppers and I think that we have

89
00:03:39,189 --> 00:03:42,099
a four or five we're gonna play with

90
00:03:40,569 --> 00:03:43,239
we're not exactly sure because I know

91
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:44,560
one of them did just get spayed or

92
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:46,090
neutered so you might be in the clinic

93
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,349
and then also one of them says that

94
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:50,019
they're not gonna be available until

95
00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:52,540
literally midnight on the 13th which is

96
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:53,739
in 8 hours from now so fingers crossed -

97
00:03:52,540 --> 00:04:11,400
and let us get a chance to play with the

98
00:03:53,739 --> 00:04:11,400
little peppers but every teacher

99
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:23,019
he really wants to pee everywhere

100
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:43,070
he's an acrobatic Seth is not interested

101
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:48,860
in you don't worry a lot of people are

102
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:50,240
in no all right you guys so we're

103
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:52,370
currently on the way home from the

104
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,620
shelter and unfortunately we are coming

105
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:55,790
home empty-handed like I said that we

106
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,139
are not an idea brush we want to make

107
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:58,419
sure we find the perfect match for our

108
00:04:57,139 --> 00:05:00,860
family oh wow

109
00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:02,030
okay so the three-year-old of life

110
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:04,250
pitbull that we had a chance to play

111
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:06,740
with really wanted no part of us at all

112
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:08,150
let's be honest what definitely did hurt

113
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,590
because he was so cute and cuddly in his

114
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:12,229
kennel but when it came to actually mind

115
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:13,520
exploring he literally just wanted no

116
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:15,080
part of us which is totally fine

117
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,850
obviously the vibe has to be right and

118
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,930
he was three years old as well which

119
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,310
there's nothing wrong with he so wanted

120
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:24,320
to give it a shot but we would prefer to

121
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:25,820
raise a puppy from puppy to dog and as

122
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,660
well we did ask about the other puppies

123
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,310
that I thought I had a special

124
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:31,100
connection we have like Snickers and

125
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:33,110
Zuma and Hershey's you just have to say

126
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,280
his name that was Emma and I firstly we

127
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,390
were not even able to play with those

128
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,760
puppies because they already had people

129
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:40,280
that were said to about them and a long

130
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:42,380
waiting list of people just in case that

131
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,820
adoption person didn't work out so all I

132
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,020
can wish is that those homeys go to a

133
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:47,570
really really amazing home when they do

134
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:49,070
get adopted and like I said we are in no

135
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:50,930
rush it is really about finding the

136
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:52,160
perfect pump to come home with us and we

137
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:53,570
wanna make sure it's a good vibe we have

138
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,620
about an hour-and-a-half drive home and

139
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:56,060
on the way home we're just going to do a

140
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:58,360
little bit more research into some local

141
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:00,159
shelters hopefully ones that aren't and

142
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,240
one half to two hours away we have

143
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:03,400
pretty much today tomorrow a on the

144
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,469
whole weekend dedicated to our puppy

145
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,039
search so who knows what'll happen in

146
00:06:05,469 --> 00:06:08,349
tomorrow

147
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:10,419

illuminae are currently on the way to

151
00:06:14,979 --> 00:06:20,490
tomorrow because every single weekend

152
00:06:26,759 --> 00:07:28,740
the world knew that we were I guess this

153
00:06:30,430 --> 00:07:31,810
weekend yes it was a sarcastic okay well

154
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:34,360
I love waving you on and then going

155
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:36,370

156
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:40,080
drive in Los Angeles but we've been - no

157
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:40,080
II know that's a cupcake truck

158
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:57,039
thank you all right you guys we're back

159
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,639
in the car again and pets Murr was a

160
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,930
bust

161
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:00,669
they're supposed to be having this like

162
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:02,680
major adoption event all weekend long

163
00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:03,909
but there was literally only four dogs

164
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,469
so you might try to check out a few

165
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:06,580
other pet smart locations today I did

166
00:08:05,469 --> 00:08:08,020
tell some my close friends that we were

167
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:10,270
planning on adopting a puffer into the

168
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:11,589
family and I'm super super pumped

169
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:12,789
because I just got a call from one of

170
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:14,169
that lover and so depends who are

171
00:08:12,789 --> 00:08:16,419
waiting for the other ones to get there

172
00:08:14,169 --> 00:08:18,370
saying that their neighbor's dog gave

173
00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:20,559
birth a few weeks ago to a litter of

174
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:21,039
puppies and they are ready to go up for

175
00:08:20,559 --> 00:08:22,659
adoption

176
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,129
they are not a breeder family they just

177
00:08:22,659 --> 00:08:25,270
literally want to find a good homes for

178
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:27,400
them because they cannot take care of

179
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:29,529
all of them and we're gonna see if they

180
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,210
have time for us to go see them today

181
00:08:29,529 --> 00:08:32,800
this literally could be perfect I'm so

182
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:34,449
excited right now I'm trying not to get

183
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,889
my hopes up just in case so you're there

184
00:08:34,449 --> 00:08:38,649
see you guys and other adoption of it or

185
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:40,029
at their house all right you guys I have

186
00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:41,260
a little bit of an update we weren't

187
00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:43,329
really having much luck out the actual

188
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:44,860
shelters when it comes to hobbies so

189
00:08:43,329 --> 00:08:46,269
getting a call from my family who just

190
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,769
wanted to find good homes for these pups

191
00:08:46,269 --> 00:08:52,329
was like literally the absolute best

192
00:08:47,769 --> 00:08:54,100
case scenario and so we drove over and

193
00:08:52,329 --> 00:09:15,399
they asked us not to come in the house

194
00:08:54,100 --> 00:09:16,930
which we obviously respected because we

195
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:18,699
just played with the whole litter for

196
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:19,990
like a good two hour trying to figure

197
00:09:18,699 --> 00:09:22,329
out which one we absolutely liked best

198
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:24,069
and this angel right here come running

199
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:25,149
back to us we actually had up treats for

200
00:09:24,069 --> 00:09:26,920
him and we were trying to teach him how

201
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:28,300
to sit and it seemed like he picked it

202
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,010
up really really quickly as well so

203
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:31,480
you're a smart little pup I get to go to

204
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:33,310
that store and pick up a collar and a

205
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:36,449
good food and the kennel and a whole

206
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:36,449
bunch of things but

207
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,840
he's perfect

208
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:53,980
that's the angle I want I want to see

209
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:59,290
him on this video and let us know

210
00:09:53,980 --> 00:10:00,790
whatever dog you think he looks for him

211
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:01,840
he does have all the shots as well thank

212
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:10,030
God we do have to get them spayed or

213
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:13,720
neutered but hi buddy a little chicken

214
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:15,670
chop from our heart is pretty much fault

215
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:18,100
we got a collar a leash dog food treats

216
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:19,930
bulls and peppy pubs a little scene or

217
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,790
remover in case he decides to make a

218
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:23,080
mess some a few little choice we can

219
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:25,990
shove a little peanut butter in there so

220
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:29,680
it has no nice snacks some first stuff

221
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:38,860
because he is already shutting quite a

222
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:40,300
lot so nice dog brush the crates lots of

223
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,620
things we have a bargain food already

224
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,510
from the family that we adopted him from

225
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:45,460
but they do not actually sell the exact

226
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:47,020
type of food here if you order that from

227
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:49,540
Amazon the second week at home pressure

228
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:51,760
I can sponsor but hash tag really please

229
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:56,530
should be but I think that's everything

230
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:58,030
so little puppy is in the and we're

231
00:10:56,530 --> 00:11:00,930
gonna check out and ahead home and let

232
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:00,930
him stay house the first time

this up and because he needs to have a

237
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:38,879
second water it is just a suicide look

238
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:38,879
at the little trot oh that's a good trot

239
00:11:43,679 --> 00:12:21,329
oh let's go outside you won't go

240
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:21,329
anywhere unless both of us are good boy

you went to the bathroom in this house

245
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:57,839
was completely outside oh yeah I think

246
00:12:46,589 --> 00:13:00,779
he's done with stairs for now that was

247
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:06,899
not a that was not a dog park that was a

248
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:09,139
human park that was you probably smells

249
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:09,139
worse

250
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:23,410
we've already noticed he starts crying

251
00:13:21,319 --> 00:13:26,410
as soon as either one of us were inside

252
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:26,410
okay

254
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:33,679
all right II know you go to stay outside

255
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:35,720
booty you had to get trained he's gonna

256
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:37,339
be inside for the first few weeks but we

257
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,269
have to train him as quickly as possible

258
00:13:37,339 --> 00:13:39,829
I deal with this a lot when we were

259
00:13:38,269 --> 00:13:41,059
growing up with training my dog I'll

260
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:43,009
need to do is just bring him outside and

261
00:13:41,059 --> 00:13:45,410
make sure that he learned to pee outside

262
00:13:43,009 --> 00:13:48,379
instead and we can just clean it up

263
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:52,369
carpets can be replace the wall puppies

264
00:13:48,379 --> 00:14:15,230
however it cannot be so it's fine oh are

265
00:13:52,369 --> 00:14:17,869
you still so cute like the amazing

266
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:19,850
youtuber than I am but the puppy is his

267
00:14:17,869 --> 00:14:21,230
first official meal with us we gave him

268
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:23,179
like a cup and a few little extra

269
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:25,009
kibbles of food and then a little bit of

270
00:14:23,179 --> 00:14:26,569
warm water this one's nice and bushy on

271
00:14:25,009 --> 00:14:27,709
his teeth and he literally ran I went up

272
00:14:26,569 --> 00:14:29,360
to the bolt and sort of eating which is

273
00:14:27,709 --> 00:14:30,589
amazing it year she just a little part

274
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,059
up and his bear over there for a good

275
00:14:30,589 --> 00:14:33,379
like alimony and Louise came out the

276
00:14:32,059 --> 00:14:35,269
house we have some folks that my

277
00:14:33,379 --> 00:14:37,790
oversight that little poplar get to meet

278
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:39,439
but the first time and I think it's

279
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:41,889
going on so you're basing somewhere he's

280
00:14:39,439 --> 00:14:41,889
loving the house

[Music]

282
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,490
okay guys it is the first night with our

283
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:59,670
popper and he is downstairs in the crate

284
00:14:50,490 --> 00:15:02,640
and he is oh this breaks my heart but

285
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:04,800
crate training is so so so important we

286
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:06,450
are almost the time but of course we

287
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,760
teach I will have had to go to meetings

288
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:10,740
and total day it's most important that

289
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,180
he is crate trained and protected and

290
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,740
feels like his crate is like his safe

291
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:15,540
place whenever we are not here obviously

292
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:31,830
right now it's like very scary for him

293
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:35,690
but once you get to sleep it's all right

294
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:35,690
so we cave and we brought him upstairs

295
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:44,190
basically what's crazy is every time

296
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:47,490
either me or Luis I get within his eye

297
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:48,960
sight he stops crying which is like

298
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:51,630
really crazy he's definitely already

299
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,860
attached which is incredible but the

300
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:55,860
last thing that I want to do is like

301
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:57,930
create separation anxiety for him on the

302
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:59,880
first day especially so we were keeping

303
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:01,440
him definitely in the crate for the

304
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,810
night but he's here he can see us

305
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,250
he's still being a grumpy and quite

306
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:07,490
every few seconds but it's definitely

307
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:10,600
not nearly as bad with the holy instant

[Music]

309
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:26,850
oh you guys we were on a date to it with

310
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:29,010
the pepper we just got home off to a

311
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:30,840
little while he was in the crate and he

312
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:32,790
is literally solo with all the training

313
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,350
and behavior so far he has not gone to

314
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:36,390
the bathroom once and his crate which is

315
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:38,250
made me so happy he's only gone to the

316
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:43,200
bathroom twice in the house like I said

317
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:44,820
excuse me oh that's my entire arm oh he

318
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,960
is teething clearly as you can see we

319
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,370
did get him a bone and he's been tight

320
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,930
with that but when the bone is not

321
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:51,270
renewable on earth which is not

322
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:53,160
acceptable he's doing it really really

323
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:54,930
well where the potty trainer he wins

324
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,220
anyone's well side which we will

325
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,449
obviously teach who knew about that but

326
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,129
for now if they cease notify

327
00:16:57,449 --> 00:17:00,119
I don't think he's potty-trained because

328
00:16:59,129 --> 00:17:01,949
he's definitely not but like he's doing

329
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:03,359
really really well that's still my

330
00:17:01,949 --> 00:17:05,069
finger we were actually loving him we

331
00:17:03,359 --> 00:17:07,049
were hovering some friends over tonight

332
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:09,360
to meet him for the first time and we're

333
00:17:07,049 --> 00:17:12,649
about to feed him some dinner so it's

334
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,649

grows up and I will obviously make sure

be
