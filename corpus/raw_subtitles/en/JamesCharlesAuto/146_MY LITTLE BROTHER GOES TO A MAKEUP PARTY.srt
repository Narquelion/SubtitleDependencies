101
00:08:50,769 --> 00:08:53,950
best feeling in the world I know this is

102
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:55,570
something that you really did not want

103
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,880
to do this morning when I proposed the

104
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:58,839
idea to you but did you end up actually

105
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,190
having a good day tonight

106
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:01,600
I mean it's pretty interesting to see

107
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:03,220
like what you go through every day and

108
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,450
like your life and all the people you

109
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,770
know it's really a lot of people think

110
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,490
youtubers do nothing but that's not

111
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:08,560
really true

112
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:10,570
I mean James's day was extremely busy

113
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,130
and it was pretty stressful actually

114
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:13,270
behind the scenes stuff that no one

115
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:14,589
actually sees is probably the most

116
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:16,500
stressful part I give him a lot of

117
00:09:14,589 --> 00:09:18,640
credit for doing his job so well oh

118
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,800
sweet of you I know you did not want to

119
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,930
do this like and this lady's bad oh not

120
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,829
at all actually not at all but it really

121
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:25,570
did mean a lot to me that you were

122
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:30,910
willing to like be such a true sister

123
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:33,339
and a true sister and live my life with

124
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:34,570
me today let's do it Peaks intense what

125
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:36,160
was your favorite part and what was your

126
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:37,360
least favorite part of the day my

127
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,070
favorite part was probably the event

128
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,510
Kosar interesting to me all these makeup

129
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:41,890
artists I've never really met before and

130
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:43,720
at least favorite part was probably just

131
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:45,399
singing because I can't sing for my wife

132
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:48,070
you didn't mind the eyelashes or the

133
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:49,750
nails oh yeah well that was awful too so

134
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:51,880
even a lot of today was makeup tailored

135
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:54,040
we did go to a photo shoot post on

136
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:55,959
Instagram do some comments you applied

137
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:58,360
to a few business emails as well and

138
00:09:55,959 --> 00:09:59,860

143
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:07,040
youtuber but probably not makeup base

144
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:08,420
but it was really nice to see all the

145
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,360
hard work that paid off at the end of

146
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:12,560
