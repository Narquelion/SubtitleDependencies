hi sisters james charles here and

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,359
welcome back to my youtube channel a few

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,120
weeks ago if you guys are familiar with

4
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,639
the tech world apple held their annual

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,840
event where basically every year they

6
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,120
announce their new

7
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,480
products their new way of how they're

8
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,840
all going to get us to spend thousands

9
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,320
and thousands of dollars

10
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,199
should i say that it's not funny should

11
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,640
i say that

12
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,240
every year there's always a new iphone

13
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,840
this year however they did not announce

14
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,600
that which honestly i'm a little bit

15
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,760
annoyed about but what did launch

16
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,039
is ios 14 and oh my god i think it's

17
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,640
been a pretty long time since any of the

18
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,240
apple updates really caused like an

19
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,040
excitement or like a splash

20
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,800
in society but i will say apple really

21
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,000
did sister snap with ios 14 because

22
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,360
there are so many really

23
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,600
really cool exciting features that i

24
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,440
have been loving so far especially

25
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,640
the ability to customize your home

26
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,239
screen i've already seen

27
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,520
so many people across all different

28
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,239
social media platforms posting

29
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,079
screenshots

30
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,680
and getting creative with their home

31
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,199
screens now mine still looks really

32
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,640
really boring i will show you guys it's

33
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:54,160
literally just my regular apps and i

34
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,600
added a fun little calendar widget so i

35
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,719
can see what's going with my day and i

36
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,160
really want to figure out how i can

37
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,600
customize my own home screen

38
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,120
but until then i thought it'd be so much

39
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,399
fun to sit down take a look at what you

40
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,519
guys have created and do

41
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:13,280
my makeup inspired by your ios 14

42
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:14,880
home screen

43
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,240
okay you guys i'm super excited to get

44
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,840
started and just sit down and play with

45
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,360
makeup today i tweeted earlier asking

46
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,040
you to send me screenshots of your ios

47
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,159
14 home screens and i am

48
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,240
so jealous of how some of them are

49
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,759
looking so far and the first home screen

50
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,520
that i want to show you guys is from

51
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,119
chloe and hers looks like

52
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,479
this looking at chloe's home screen i'm

53
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,240
definitely noticing a few things right

54
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,520
off the bat it is very cute it's very

55
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,880
bright and it's also very

56
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,119
soft which is definitely giving me a lot

57
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,560
of inspiration for a fun makeup look to

58
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,000
combine all these elements in her

59
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,680
background she has these orange

60
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,360
butterflies and there's a user on

61
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,640
twitter that i follow named lauren her

62
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,240
at is raggedy royal

63
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,920
she had this whole like butterfly eye

64
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,880
look trend which could be really really

65
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,880
fun to do and

66
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,240
all of her app icons are pink and

67
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,840
glittery which i normally

68
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,520
don't love her makeup looks you guys

69
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,880
have heard me talk about this but i feel

70
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,439
like i have a really good idea of how i

71
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,840
could pull

72
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,200
all these elements into a fun look so

73
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,680
let's go ahead and see what we can come

74
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,040
up with

75
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,079
okay you guys so for the first step as

76
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,079
always i'm just going to grab a little

77
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,439
bit of concealer and put this on my

78
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,959
eyelid to act as my

79
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,959
rhymer and then we're just going to go

80
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,160
right in with our shadows so i think i'm

81
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,800
going to start

82
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,840
first by grabbing actually let me not

83
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,400
use my palette for once i'm going to

84
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,920
grab the

85
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,200
perfect cosmetics like stacy marie

86
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,560
carnival palette and i'm going to dip

87
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,200
into this shade up here called

88
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,200
slow burn it's just a really pretty like

89
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,920
burnt orange color and i'm going to

90
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,200
pack this in the outer corner now that

91
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,560
that's laid down i'm just going to grab

92
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,400
a little fluffy brush

93
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,879
and dip into honestly maybe a little bit

94
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,080
of a 518 and just blend that out if i

95
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,519
was gonna do this look myself i would

96
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,120
honestly probably start off with a much

97
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,040
darker color just because i really like

98
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,440
high contrast but chloe's home screen is

99
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,120
so

100
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,720
soft that i honestly feel like this will

101
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,480
be perfect i really want to match

102
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,360
chloe's muted pink tones as much as i

103
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,519
possibly can

104
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,319
so i'm gonna grab the shade mary from my

105
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,260
palette on an m456 and use this color

106
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,680
to further like the crease

107
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:58,480
[Music]

108
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,360
um just put this here and i'm gonna grab

109
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,360
some pinkity

110
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,560
drinkity just on a fluffy brush and

111
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,920
blend out that

112
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,680
mary and i'm just gonna use a little

113
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,959
flat top concealer brush and some more

114
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,640
concealer to cut

115
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,319
my crease now i'm just gonna grab a

116
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,959
little bit of sister which is like the

117
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,120
metallic

118
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,159
champagne shade i'm just gonna pack this

119
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,400
right onto

120
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,879
the lid i'm also gonna use the shade to

121
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,959
highlight the inner corner as well

122
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,400
why does this look so patchy down here

123
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,640
it's a pumpkin patch

124
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,840
yeah what is going on i guess it won't

125
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,480
really matter to be honest because it'll

126
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,560
be covered in

127
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,680
a butterfly anyway there we go that's

128
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,760
the shape that i'm going for

129
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,080
okay now i'm gonna apply some nice

130
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,480
glitter adhesive oh god i

131
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,840
hate hate using glitter it's just gross

132
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,879
like once you put on glitter you're

133
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,120
stuck with it for the next

134
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,920
roughly three to four business days okay

135
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,560
so just mark

136
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,720
a general note that i'm noticing i'm

137
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,159
just not feeling a lot of enthusiasm as

138
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,519
i'm looking at the screen so i think

139
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,560
that might read across

140
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,959
the audience are you still filming yes

141
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,480
and that looks okay okay so now that the

142
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,400
overall shapes and glitter are all on

143
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,239
there it is time to add our butterfly

144
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,080
design so it's going to take my nice

145
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,879
liquid liner and i'm going to just do a

146
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,319
regular

147
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,959
wing okay now i'm just going to draw a

148
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,400
gigantic wing basically

149
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,400
and i'm just going to add in the little

150
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,799
lines okay so now the same thing on the

151
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,000
little

152
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,879
lower wing situation okay and now the

153
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,560
last step of this

154
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,400
butterfly eye is just take a little bit

155
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,919
of white eyeliner

156
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:25,600
and add in the dots oh hey

157
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:28,160
oh no hey oh he just peed

158
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,199
like the most p i've ever actually seen

159
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,320
great

160
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,080
mascara time all right you guys so this

161
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,360
is one eye of this look all complete i'm

162
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,720
gonna cut into the other one off camera

163
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,280
quickly and i'll be right back with the

164
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,280
finished

165
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,400
look i matched the other eye off camera

166
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,560
added a ton

167
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,000
of this beautiful baby pink blush some

168
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,240
pink highlighter and just did a cute

169
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,720
little ombre glossy lip and i think that

170
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,960
is this

171
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,080
soft pink butterfly look inspired by

172
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,919
chloe's home screen

173
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,520
all complete i really love how this look

174
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,360
turned out today the soft orange and

175
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,960
pink tones work so beautifully together

176
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,160
and remind me so much of the fall season

177
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,280
coming soon and even though the

178
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,639
butterflies on the eye

179
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,080
do look like a really really vibrant

180
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,520
statement piece they were actually

181
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,720
really really easy to do and i think

182
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,479
this look was super

183
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,160
super cool thank you once again to chloe

184
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,280
for suggesting it to me and i think it

185
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,639
is now time to move on to

186
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,320
the next one yo yo

187
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,919

189
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,280
and she sent me these screenshots of her

190
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,199
phone now as you guys can see it's very

191
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,720
like purple very periwinkle which is by

192
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,199
far my favorite color in the entire

193
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,320
world

194
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,840
and it's very just like common calming

195
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,440
yes is it weird to say like this would

196
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,720
remind me of like that lavender like

197
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,160
pillow spray that would like put you to

198
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,400
sleep relaxation

199
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,199
calming down ending off the day on a

200
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,880
positive

201
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,880
beautiful note vibes

202
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,720
sure i don't do makeup looks with this

203
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,240
color very often so i'm definitely

204
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,039
excited for this and as you guys can see

205
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,199
on her little

206
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,880
widget smith app she has it's like this

207
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,120
very like purpley pinky

208
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,880
sky with little planets and stars like

209
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,759
drawn in as a cartoon over top which i

210
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,000
think is so

211
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,360
so cute so i'm going to use that as my

212
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
source of inspiration for this makeup

213
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,960
look today

214
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,720
as always i'm just going to take a

215
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,360
little bit of my concealer and use it as

216
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,039
my eye

217
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,479
shadow base that i am using a really

218
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,560
light shade this time just because

219
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,960
since we're working with pastels we want

220
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,160
them to really pop

221
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,080
first i'm just going to grab a little

222
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,880
fluffy brush and just use some different

223
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,600
shades of purple

224
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,919
uh maybe a little bit of single which i

225
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,720

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,520
white

good one

246
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,919
now i'm just gonna start drawing in some

247
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,919
nice planets that's

248
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,840
saturn

249
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,280
shall we cut or just keep rolling no

250
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,639
let's just keep rolling

251
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,840
who knows maybe something great will

252
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:16,080
come out of this tell us

253
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,360
really shitty it just seems like every

254
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,520
time that i find somebody great

255
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,039
it's like three seconds later they're

256
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,400
not but it's also like

257
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,240
if it's not gonna work it's not gonna

258
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,880
work i mean i think by constantly saying

259
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,479
that at least

260
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,080
forever and all that you put that out

261
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,599
there that's what comes back to you

262
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,280
i know it's just really hard to think

263
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,759
otherwise with all this like stupid [ __ ]

264
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,919
that i've

265
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,680
dealt with to finish off the eyes i'm

266
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,680
just going to apply a little coat of

267
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,120
mascara since we did the white liner and

268
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,639
then also all the little white drawings

269
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,680
i honestly don't want to do a full lash

270
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,880
because this is going to cover up all

271
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,160
the work that we just did

272
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,599
for my lips today of course i'm going to

273
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,440
match it right to it the eye so i'm

274
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,440
going to grab the ofra las vegas

275
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,639
liquid lipstick all right you guys will

276
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,800
know that the lips are all on and

277
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,720
matching the eyes very very perfectly

278
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,800
i think that completes this pastel skies

279
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,280
look inspired by leah's ios 14 home

280
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,560
screen

281
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,919
honestly this might be one of the first

282
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,440
times while doing these like recreating

283
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,240
art videos that i haven't been in love

284
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,080
with the final

285
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,599
look usually i'm like obsessed with them

286
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,919
but honestly this time i don't really

287
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,360
know

288
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,960
leah's home screen in the color scheme

289
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,319
is so so cute and i feel like i had a

290
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,840
really good vision for this look in my

291
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,360
head but i honestly just feel like i

292
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,639
didn't do the best job executing it i

293
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,160
think the colors are really cute i think

294
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,599
like the white liner idea

295
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,879
was really really cute as well but i

296
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,080
just feel like this could have been a

297
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,800
lot better but i don't really know what

298
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,560
i would have done

299
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,240
to change it i would love to see how you

300
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,440
would recreate this and hopefully do it

301
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,120
a whole lot better than mine

302
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,639
it's a cute idea so regardless i hope

303
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,080
you guys enjoyed this look and now it is

304
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:34,080
time to wipe it off and move on to

305
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,080
the next one okay so when i tweeted it

306
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,880
so when i tweeted you guys asking to

307
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,560
send me photos of your home screens

308
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,200
there was a million different themes and

309
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,719
aesthetics

310
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,560
but i did notice that there was one

311
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,839
style in particular that a ton of

312
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,399
different people were using

313
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,760
and that was neon icons i picked out

314
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,600
this photo from autumn

315
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,040
diane as you guys can see she has a very

316
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,880
like billy eilish green

317
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,160
and black neon inspired lock screen

318
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,519
which i think looks super

319
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,279
super cool so i thought that this would

320
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,640
be a really fun trend to pull into

321
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,160
a makeup look basically what i'm

322
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,760
envisioning for this look today is a

323
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,480
graphic liner that looks like it's like

324
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,959
a neon

325
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,240
light against like a black backdrop

326
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:09,120
normally i would lay down the black

327
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,360
first but i'm definitely concerned about

328
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,800
putting a collar over top of black

329
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,640
whatever let's just try and see what

330
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,000
happens i guess just placing the shadow

331
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,399
in the general area where i want it to

332
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,760
be

333
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,360
obviously we're going to blend that out

334
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,519
but i don't want to go too crazy with

335
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,920
the block just yet because

336
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,920
i mean y'all already know looks like a

337
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,040
like a literal drag queen eyeliner

338
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,959
okay now i'm just taking a little bit

339
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,959
more of that black i'm going to use this

340
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,680
on a fluffy brush to diffuse out these

341
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,720
edges

342
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,240
very very very very carefully put this

343
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,760
on the lower lash line as well

344
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,440
so now basically what i'm going to do is

345
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,040
grab a little bit more of this white

346
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,640
liner you see lots of white liner in

347
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,760
this video i don't know why that ended

348
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,720
up happening that way but

349
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,360
basically i'm just going to grab a

350
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,360
little liner brush and sketch out

351
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,640
like the graphic liner that i want to do

352
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,839
but i'm actually for ones

353
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,200
not going to worry about it being too

354
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,640
precise because we're going to blend it

355
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,440
out and now i'm just going to grab

356
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,320
a little fluffy brush i saw a ton of

357
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,760
people doing a green

358
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,519
nia but i also saw a lot of people doing

359
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,200
blue so maybe i'll actually do like an

360
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,760
ombre of the two colors do you think

361
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,760
that'd be cool yeah i'm just gonna grab

362
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,120
some shadows just like this and i'm

363
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,680
going to pack that

364
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,360
right on top of that white liner just

365
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,440
like this

366
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,800
that looks so cool oh that actually does

367
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,800
look kind of cool

368
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,640
oh period now i'll just switch it over

369
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,680
to a little bit of teal in the middle

370
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,160
i'm just gonna place a little bit of

371
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,680
that green neon shade right in the inner

372
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,880
corner because we'll place a highlighter

373
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,920
there later on so now that we have the

374
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,000
colors kind of messily

375
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,839
placed on there and like i said this

376
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,600
mess kind of was on purpose because this

377
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,200
is basically going to be like the glow

378
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,040
of the neon we don't want this to look

379
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,640
like the actual light just yet that's

380
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,399
going to be what happens right

381
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,160
now with a tiny little liner brush and a

382
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,880
little bit more white liner i'm going to

383
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,200
go in with a

384
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,399
second layer in that same general shape

385
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,120
but this time i'm going to be much more

386
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,440
precise

387
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,200
with my line oh i definitely want to add

388
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,079
in that color to my

389
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,440
lash line oh my kind of fun wow that

390
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:58,839
actually turned out really good

391
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:01,839
we love her off the juice cody guppy

392
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:01,839
tripping

393
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,279
all right you guys well that was fast i

394
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,959
think that is one eye of this neon look

395
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,160
all complete i was definitely worried

396
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,200
about this technique at first but i

397
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,640
think that i got it down

398
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,920
pretty fast and i am loving how this is

399
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,760
looking at so far i'm gonna go ahead

400
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,959
i'm gonna go ahead and do the other one

401
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,000
off camera quickly and i'll be right

402
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,839
back with the finished

403
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,440
look okay you guys the lips are on and i

404
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,440
think that they added such a cool like

405
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,519
punk vibe to this makeup look and i

406
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,839
think that is this neon look inspired by

407
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,360
diane's home screen all complete when i

408
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,079
first saw people using neon icons in

409
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,839
their home screen

410
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,680
right away i knew the makeup look that i

411
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,000
wanted to create and spoiler alert it

412
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,519
was

413
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,560
this one but i wasn't sure how i was

414
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,160
actually going to achieve that just

415
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,600
because sometimes layering on a bright

416
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,720
colors over top of black is like

417
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,399
literally impossible

418
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,000
but i think that we nailed the technique

419
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,600
and this looks so so

420
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,040
so cool i've seen a lot of people do

421
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,720
this neon liner before so i'm absolutely

422
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,160
not taking credit but i would love to

423
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,360
see what you guys can come up with after

424
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,399
seeing this technique with all that

425
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,160
being said i have been down in the

426
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,440
studio for hours now voting this video

427
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,360
and i think that it is time to bring

428
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,360
this one to a close i had

429
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,880
so much fun recreating these three very

430
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,760
different makeup looks from these three

431
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,720
very very different ios 14 home screens

432
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,000
