00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,780
hi sisters James Charles here and

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,770
welcome back to my youtube channel for

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,509
today today I have something a little

4
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:08,429
bit different and very very fun plan

5
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:11,040
that I'm actually so excited for this

6
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:13,290
morning I got up at the crack of dawn I

7
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,139
arose for my beauty sleep with a rude

8
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,789
alarm awakening but I went to the Grove

9
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:21,630
here in Los Angeles and waited in line

10
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:22,619
to get this the brand new iPhone acts in

11
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,449
case you missed an apple just released

12
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:26,099
two brand new iPhones beating the iPhone

13
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:28,289
8 and the iPhone acts I guess they

14
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:31,289
skipped the iPhone 9 because two seven

15
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:32,669
eight nine huh anyway regardless the

16
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:34,050
iPhone ACTU the iPhone 10 is the

17
00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:34,980
brand-new anniversary I have one edition

18
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,120
and there are a lot of brand new

19
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:38,010
features to this phone that have never

20
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,540
been on an iPhone before one of the main

21
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,250
ones being that the way to unlock this

22
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,440
as you can see there was no home button

23
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,430
is a facial recognition unlock feature

24
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,719
there's been a lot of different

25
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,160
conspiracies about this some people

26
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:48,450
think it's really really dope some

27
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,250
people think that Apple is gathering a

28
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,899
facial recognition software to give to

29
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,670
the government I don't even know what

30
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:55,230
the hell is going on but this thing is

31
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,680
supposed to open up when I show my face

32
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,930
to it

33
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,609
and it's supposed to be really really

34
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,989
accurate you guys know that my job is

35
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:02,640
that makeup artist so most days also

36
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:04,559
enough like this but a lot of times

37
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,869
after a good long glam session I'll end

38
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,310
up with a even skin tone very very

39
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:10,530
contoured shakes a little bit I mean

40
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,119
lowered hairline with the facetune tool

41
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,619
a good highlight on the cheekbones

42
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:15,479
different eyebrows sometimes we have

43
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:17,759
crazy ass lashes on and sometimes even a

44
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:18,869
wig if it's a toggle as well so I'm

45
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,909
definitely very into the art of

46
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:22,830
transforming and pulling out different

47
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:24,630
looks so for today's video we're gonna

48
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,710
be using the brand new iPhone X and

49
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:27,780
we're gonna be applying a whole lot of

50
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:29,880
makeup today and seeing how much makeup

51
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,200
can really unpack the iPhone X to the

52
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,540
point where it won't recognize my face

53
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,490
anymore without further ado let's start

54
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,140
getting glam and transform as much as

55
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:39,479
possible to see if the iPhone will still

56
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,280
a mock once I glam session is complete

57
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:42,840
also make sure you stay tuned until the

58
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,070
very end of this video for to a very

59
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,220
very special announcements

60
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:48,220
[Music]

61
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:51,289
so before we actually apply any makeup

62
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:53,060
today I'm actually gonna go ahead and

63
00:01:51,289 --> 00:01:55,250
set up the facial recognition software

64
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:57,170
so I'm gonna go into my settings on my

65
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:59,270
brand new iPhone and go into the face ID

66
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:01,670
and passcode I'm gonna turn on use face

67
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:03,979
Indy for iPhone unlock and I guess I'm

68
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:05,810
going to have to set my face ID so of

69
00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:08,300
course I'm going to start this off by

70
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:09,619
using my bare face whoa this lady makes

71
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,849
my face look so bad

72
00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:12,590
face ID is messed up I guess it was

73
00:02:10,849 --> 00:02:14,870
literally that easy so let's hit done

74
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:16,970
and just to touch this out let's go

75
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:21,890
ahead and lock the phone and if I open

76
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:23,000
it up hello so I guess I've seen when

77
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:24,290
you put your face up to the phone it

78
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,610
would automatically open but that is not

79
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:27,590
the case as you can see there's a lock

80
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:29,690
icon at the top and when I put my face

81
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:31,579
in front of it it recognizes me and then

82
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:35,090
it turns to an open lock and then I can

83
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:36,079
swipe up hello and now the phone is open

84
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,760
this is complicated

85
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:39,500
jessa test is how I have sister Anthony

86
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,720
here with me as you can see the phone is

87
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,459
locked right now come on down I need you

88
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:47,079
to hold this up and test it to your face

89
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:51,530
and see if the thing changes to unlocked

90
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:53,480
no okay thank you so much we love

91
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:55,670
technology Hey so now we know that this

92
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,260
whole face ID thing works for now while

93
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:58,970
I have no makeup on let's go ahead and

94
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,530
put on a full face of Graham transform

95
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:02,420
ourselves and try again at the end and

96
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,500
see if this thing it still works I'm

97
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,000
first gonna shot off by applying my

98
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,019
makeup from from Ultra HD foundation SiC

99
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,150
don't forget to blend down the neck of

100
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,620
course and then I'm gonna grab a beauty

101
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:11,329
blender and blend this all in so based

102
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,799
on apples information face ID works on

103
00:03:11,329 --> 00:03:14,480
your facial structure so I guess it's

104
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:16,010
supposed to measure the depth of your

105
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,690
face so even though we're gonna be

106
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:19,400
contouring a lot today it really Chezza

107
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:21,769
ourselves out and try to fool the camera

108
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,299
I'm sure that the technology may be

109
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:25,160
advanced enough to actually like do

110
00:03:23,299 --> 00:03:26,540
measurements I'm really not sure how

111
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,950
this stuff works even though it says it

112
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,299
does measures distance I'm sure it does

113
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:31,400
measure things as well such as like eye

114
00:03:29,299 --> 00:03:32,630
color and skin color obviously the goal

115
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,250
with your foundation is to get your skin

116
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:36,139
cloud to be as accurate as possible to

117
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,489
your normal skin color but for people

118
00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:38,959
like me and my face is definitely a lot

119
00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:40,069
more red than the rest of my body I do

120
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,019
have a lot of pimples and a lot of

121
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:43,310
rosacea as well so skin color may affect

122
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:44,359
it as well foundation is all apply it

123
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,849
I'm gonna grab my phone and I'm gonna

124
00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:47,959
test this one out

125
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:49,310
still on lock's I'm not gonna get my

126
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:51,440
shake tape concealer in the shade light

127
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:52,489
sand and just highlight my face I'm

128
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,290
gonna make sure to make my highlights

129
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:56,239
and contours very very very intense

130
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:57,829
today to try my best to fool the system

131
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,420
I'm actually gonna take the Kat Von D

132
00:03:57,829 --> 00:03:59,990
whiteout concealer as well obviously

133
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,670
this is in

134
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:04,040
show you white and I'm gonna play those

135
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:05,480
to the very high points of my face just

136
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,860
to once again intensify those highlights

137
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,210
this for the hell of that I'm gonna go

138
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:12,230
ahead and also try this wall the stuff

139
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:13,340
is on my face unblended still works once

140
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:16,520
again just gonna blend it out using a

141
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:18,380
and damp Beauty Blender oh oh oops I'm

142
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,700
still work I'm gonna take my sponge into

143
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:21,980
a little bit of laura mercier Jeb's is a

144
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,780
setting powder to set my face in place

145
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:25,220
so it doesn't move around so now that my

146
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:27,050
face is all set in place I'm going to

147
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:29,090
use the Kat Von D shade and light

148
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:31,310
palette and I'm going to contour the

149
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:33,440
crap out of my face using my morphe m

150
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:35,270
405 brush you guys know you can use

151
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,890
coded change for 10% off for a few

152
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:38,300
products and I'm really gonna go in

153
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:40,010
intense with this I'm gonna use and mix

154
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:42,050
up the middle and right hand shades

155
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:44,360
obviously I would never instruct on

156
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:46,160
doing a contour this straw I mean if you

157
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,500
really want to chill yourself out like I

158
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,270
don't blame you girl but I usually go

159
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,770
more soft contour but today we're trying

160
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:52,940
to create a completely false facial

161
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:54,920
structure here let's see if we can

162
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:56,210
really define these cheeks I'm gonna use

163
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,590
this contour brush and kind of pull it

164
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:59,150
down slightly right in this region as

165
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,980
well to create the illusion of a more

166
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:02,450
sunken in cheekbone to see if that will

167
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,980
flow as well of course we have to

168
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:05,540
contour the hell out of the forehead but

169
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:07,910
let's be real I do this in all my looks

170
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:08,960
regardless so does a normal step for me

171
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,580
then of course we're gonna contour our

172
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,020
jaw lines and make sure that the Dolan

173
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,970
twins aren't quaking I'm gonna contour

174
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,260
my nose as well using a really really

175
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:17,840
dark powder on a fluffy blending brush

176
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:18,950
oh my that looks the worst we're gonna

177
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,750
grab a lighter powder that's really

178
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:22,400
close to my skin tone and put this on

179
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:24,380
the sides my nose to really enhance the

180
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,790
look of the pinch okay so my faces a

181
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,680
little bit just lit out if I do say so

182
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:29,240
myself obviously this is not what my

183
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,590
normal makeup looks like I promise if

184
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,120
you're new to the sisterhood please

185
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:33,680
check out some of my other videos my

186
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,660
makeup usually looks a lot better than

187
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,030
this or at least I hope it does but

188
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:40,130
let's go ahead and try this out

189
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:41,180
it's still on locks oh my god

190
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:42,620
I'm gonna take a powder puff and we're

191
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:44,570
going to bake the highlights of my face

192
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:45,800
to really intensify this even more gonna

193
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:49,370
go right up against the line of the nose

194
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,540
contour okay I'm a little bit stuck

195
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:52,370
right now I really thought this is gonna

196
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:53,930
not work a whole lot sooner than it

197
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:55,130
already is and I'm not realizing that

198
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:56,930
I'm gonna have to probably go a lot

199
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:59,480
farther into my makeup routine then

200
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:02,030
anticipated so die of the mood to do

201
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:03,380
that right now but guys we have to

202
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,460
figure this out well my face is baking

203
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,690
in the oven I'm gonna go to my benefit

204
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:08,570
purse I see my brow pencil in the shade

205
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:11,210
at number 4 and to find out my eyebrows

206
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:13,120
who knows if it's not my freakin facial

207
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:15,490
shape maybe my eyebrows will fool that

208
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,570
oh you know what while we're at it let's

209
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:17,860
go ahead and try out the brand-new

210
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:19,720
camera on this too because it's

211
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:23,380
apparently supposed to be really oh my

212
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:25,000
god I'm scared my pores oh this is like

213
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:26,620
scary good quality okay let's go ahead

214
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,169
and try to use this as an actual mirror

215
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:31,270
oh you're kidding

216
00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:32,949
okay this idea was cancelled alright

217
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:34,870
let's go ahead and see if brows the fact

218
00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:36,389
this at this point I'm starting to lose

219
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:39,940
my hope here

220
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:41,080
No Oh virtually for this video I

221
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,010
honestly did not have high hopes for

222
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,419
this I thought I was gonna be able to

223
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:44,680
pull this really easily I was gonna do

224
00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:46,660
my everyday makeup routine for you guys

225
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,880
but clearly this is not working out as

226
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:50,620
well as I had planned so instead of

227
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,570
doing my normal Lily lashes miami's I

228
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:54,460
let it go on my three oh ones which is

229
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:56,950
you guys know if you are drag fans that

230
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:59,350
these are the classic drag lashes they

231
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:02,669
are huge they're very very long and

232
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:04,600
they're gonna take out my entire eye but

233
00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:06,400
maybe it'll look like a different person

234
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,500
okay so this is definitely not the look

235
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,940
I had intended on going for today but I

236
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:12,400
guess you got to do what you got to do

237
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:13,930
so would these lashes applied let's go

238
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,490
ahead and blend them together with some

239
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:17,020
mascara I'm going to mix together my

240
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:19,180
real lashes with the fake ones make this

241
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,919
look as real as possible despite the

242
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:22,990
fact that I have literal spiders glued

243
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:28,780
onto my eyes right now and we're going

244
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:37,180
to test this thing out okay iPhone locks

245
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:39,430
oh and this we're really not sure what I

246
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:40,900
can do to make this not work I guess I'm

247
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:43,090
just going to wipe off my bake here and

248
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:44,410
then apply a crazy-ass lip and some

249
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:46,000
highlighter and if that doesn't work

250
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:47,800
we're gonna have to take some drastic

251
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,849
measures here I'm next gonna take my

252
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,680
makeup of our pigment in the shade

253
00:07:48,849 --> 00:07:52,210
number 13 this is probably the most

254
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:55,030
blinding highlighter that is in my

255
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:58,090
collection it is the most pigmented and

256
00:07:55,030 --> 00:08:00,130
is so so so bright when I do use this I

257
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:01,810
only use the slightest bit I'm gonna pry

258
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:03,940
this using my more of um of 501 brush

259
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:05,830
you see what I'm talking about here to

260
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:07,120
the high points of my face so since none

261
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:08,380
of this work the last step in my makeup

262
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,950
routine is always gonna be the lipid you

263
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,300
doodahs

264
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:11,770
go for today it's like I'm gonna use the

265
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,990
Anasazi liquid lipstick in the shade of

266
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:16,150
paint and I'm going to go a little bit

267
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:19,790
crazy with the over lining

268
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:23,840
laughs injections never heard of her

269
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:27,950
let's try this you're kidding

270
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:30,770
you've got this is God to be a joke how

271
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:36,230
I'm out of makeup tips let's go ahead

272
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:40,940
and try a little bit harder here phone

273
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:42,530
oh my god I am so shocked right now

274
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,700
this is not what I wanted I thought this

275
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:45,560
video is gonna take me five minutes to

276
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:48,080
film I really thought my ass was gonna

277
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:50,240
have Apple quaking as soon as I got like

278
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,920
the nose contour I'm annoyed because not

279
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,930
only did I have to put on makeup for the

280
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,360
seven times today now I look really

281
00:08:53,930 --> 00:09:06,260
stupid and I have places to go after

282
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:08,540
this so at this point I'm a little

283
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:10,880
stumped clearly the crazy makeup did not

284
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:12,500
work like I wanted it to the wigs did

285
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,300
not work like I wanted them to so my

286
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:16,670
last and final step today is gonna be to

287
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:18,200
try out a photo of myself no Apple seems

288
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:20,000
the photos do not work you have to be

289
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,260
like alive and breathing for the phone

290
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,910
to recognize you which is great

291
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:25,610
considering my job this ability to post

292
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:26,810
photos myself online so thank God if my

293
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:29,390
phone gets stolen at least on all that a

294
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:31,610
photo can open it up but let's go ahead

295
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:32,420
and try out and see the real tape all

296
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,680
right so this is my most recent

297
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:35,690
Instagram photo I just posted this

298
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,340
earlier on today if your true sister

299
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:38,330
will give it a double tap and if you're

300
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,590
not following me on Instagram

301
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:41,480
you should totally do that for a cute

302
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:42,890
very face to him selfies every once in a

303
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,480
while I promise it is a very very good

304
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:46,490
time come on shameless self-promotion

305
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,430
but I'm gonna take this photo on

306
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:51,200
Anthony's phone and my new iPhone X and

307
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:54,210
then hold them right up in front of each

308
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:57,180
other and see if this works

309
00:09:54,210 --> 00:10:02,340
[Music]

310
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:04,260
hello she's not working Mary Wow that's

311
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:06,480
thought after an hour of making herself

312
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:08,040
look absolutely ridiculous all I needed

313
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,930
to do was hold up a photo of myself in

314
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,940
front of it it probably knows that it

315
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:13,500
was facetune Harbor okay so that's all I

316
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,480
have for this videos today clearly this

317
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,010
did not exactly go as I had planned

318
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,690
honestly at this point I am really

319
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:20,490
really shook and impressed by the new

320
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:22,680
iPhone X facial brush to make facial

321
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:24,390
bracket and honestly at this point I am

322
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,560
really really shocked and impressed by

323
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,480
the new iPhone facial recognition

324
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,680
software I really did not think I was

325
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,970
gonna be this good I thought I would

326
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,320
easily be able to crack it at some point

327
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:32,430
throughout this routine the only thing

328
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,930
we got it with today was the picture

329
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:35,640
which is actually a really really good

330
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:37,320
thing so I'm actually very glad to know

00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,700

00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:30,180
let's be honest at keeping up a

364
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,010
consistent posting schedule but because

365
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,360
of a few videos that had to be uploaded

366
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:35,730
on a certain day coming up within the

367
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,900
next few days I figured might as well

368
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:41,670
make this week a big big bang so

369
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:45,000
starting today Saturday there will be a

370
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:47,370
new upload every single day up until

371
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,930
next Friday so this week overall is

372
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:51,240
gonna be so much fun and I hope you guys

373
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:53,010
