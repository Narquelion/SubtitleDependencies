30
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,579
few hours

31
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:57,899
oopsies it was such a world welcomed by

32
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:59,699
all the Murphy staff members who were

33
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:01,079
all wearing my palette on the eyes such

34
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:03,300
beautiful looks and speaking of

35
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,710
beautiful looks I've ever been more shut

36
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,570
by a meet and greet card in my entire

37
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:08,549
life because so many of the sisters

38
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:10,560
there had the most beautiful eye makeup

39
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:13,110
looks I have ever ever seen and they're

40
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,030
all so beyond nice and for the UK media

41
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,619
but regardless it was an incredible

42
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,729
experience that I will truly never

43
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:19,799
forget and I'm definitely looking

44
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:22,740
forward to going back very very soon but

45
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:25,140
we are now home back in LA for his warm

46
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,000
and cozy and it is time to get work done

47
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,420
and that brings us to today's a brand

48
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,950
new video

49
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,020
while I was over in the UK between

50
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:32,549
London and LA there was an 8 hour time

51
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,740
difference and I usually can pass out

52
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:35,970
literally just about anywhere but for

53
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,560
some reason I was having really really

54
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,400
bad at sleep issues while I was there so

55
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,470
I found myself strolling through

56
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,119
Instagram a lot and I discovered that

57
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,950
there is a brand new trend going on here

58
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:45,810

00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,950

60
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,930

62
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:53,640

63
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:56,159

traveling and I'm not gonna text me with

81
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:25,090
makeup in a very very long time I

82
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,010
thought I'd be so much fun to try out

83
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:29,530
this challenge for myself to use a whole

84
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:32,930
lot of makeup my palate a wig and outfit

85
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:38,280
to turn myself into a Bratz doll

86
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:40,360
[Music]

87
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,620
all right sisters this is going to be

88
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,120
quite the transformation so I just want

89
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,650
to go ahead and get right into the video

90
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,600
well I was traveling I came across and

91
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:48,220
stalked so many of these different doll

92
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,810
accounts kind of figure out what's look

93
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,860
I wanted to recreate there were so many

94
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:52,030
of them and I think it's so cool that

95
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,950
this actually can art form that people

96
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:55,720
are doing right now somebody even said

97
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:56,950

102
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,700
jock which I thought was so cool but

103
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:04,900
after going through and finding a bunch

104
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:07,060

super long blonde hair slicked back

00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,310
fishnets thigh highs that of course a

111
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:19,420
cute little for a backpack I think this

112
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:21,160
bra stall is literally like the

113
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:23,500
sportswear a female version of me and

114
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,760
I'm so excited to become her today I'm

115
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,050
first gonna start by putting a wig cap

116
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,880
on at first all because my hair is

117
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:29,290
looking at literally disgusting I'm

118
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,880
gonna make my head look like the AG that

119
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:32,770
broke the answer I'm like record if I

120
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,209
have a kind of a plain base to work on

121
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:35,709
so the first of the transformation is

122
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:37,330
going to be to glue down at my eyebrows

123
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:39,370
obviously I have very thick and dark

124
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:40,150
bushy brows whereas this bra still has

125
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:42,430
nice and lifted

126
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:44,170
thin blonde eyebrows so I'm gonna grab

127
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,760
my Elmer's a washable school glue stick

128
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:46,930
and just go right in I've done a few

129
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,950
different tutorials on carving my brows

130
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:49,269
before Oh still they should link them

131
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,440
right up here but I'm just gonna speed

132
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:52,620
through this and we'll go on to the next

133
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,620
step

134
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:03,150
[Music]

135
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:07,290
all right so we've made it to this

136
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:09,180
lovely stop right here at the browser

137
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,320
laid down and ready to be covered and

138
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,670
normally next I'll go into the

139
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,500
foundation which I definitely it's still

140
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:15,000
not going to but you guys know I

141
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,010
definitely - laid out a kind of base

142
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,329
first that we're not going to be doing

143
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:19,709
today because the fact that this eye

144
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:21,570
look is so interpreted it's gonna be a

145
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:23,370
lot of like kind of art and fine details

146
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:24,750
I don't want to laid out a full base and

147
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:26,820
then God forbid I mess up and have to

148
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:28,770
wipe it all off so I'm just gonna kind

149
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:30,210
of focus the foundation in this area and

150
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:31,650
then kind of build up the rest later

151
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:33,690
I've never really done this before but

152
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:35,190
hopefully it works out regardless I'm

153
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,540
gonna use the Krylon TV paint stick in

154
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:38,610
the shade and be and cover everything

155
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:41,730
right up there taking morphia beauty

156
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:43,470
sponge and blend this right now it no no

157
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:46,169
actually I'll use the fenty beauty

158
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:47,580
sponge TV that blends it so well no

159
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:49,830
matter how many times I do drag or I'll

160
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,480
cover this is always so horrifying to me

161
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:52,919
okay so well my foundation is still I'm

162
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,720
gonna go in with an angled brush and the

163
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:56,220
anasazi a dip brow pomade in the shade

164
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,110
taupe because obviously you want to do a

165
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,550
blonde brown today I'll do this my

166
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:01,350
foundation is still wet so just in case

167
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:03,180
I mess up I can easily fix it before

168
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:05,010
it's all set with powder so I'm just

169
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:07,620
gonna go right in and I'm just going to

170
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:09,030
start sketching at this Brown oh I'm

171
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,410
gonna start the bottom line of the brow

172
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:12,090
in the same place as I normally would

173
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:14,729
but we're obviously gonna make this a

174
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:15,870
lot more arched than normal and I'm

175
00:05:14,729 --> 00:05:17,700
keeping the photo right next to me for

176
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:19,020
reference and then if I look forward

177
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,240
right about at the edge of my people I'm

178
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:22,770
gonna start turning that brow kind of a

179
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,180
little bit more down if you guys have

180
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:25,590
seen my drawing videos before even

181
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,490
honestly like my regular makeup - and

182
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:28,410
you definitely know that I like to have

183
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:29,700
my brow tail out really really far and

184
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:31,650
make this kind of like a super super

185
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,970
straight but in this photo she does have

186
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:34,380
a little bit of a shorter tail so I'm

187
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,850
definitely try to emulate that as close

188
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:38,370
as possible and then it's gonna sketch

189
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:39,660
in the other end of the tail I really

190
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:41,070
really like using the anasazi at Deborah

191
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:42,660
for this stuff just because like I said

192
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:44,370
it is a cream product so if I mess up I

193
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:46,110
can really easily wipe it away and fix

194
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:47,550
it but it's also a really really

195
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,840
buildable product so I could either use

196
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:50,220
a little bit of it and get kind of a

197
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:52,200
lighter coverage like I'm going to do in

198
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:54,360
the inner portion or a packet on for

199
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:56,699
that full coverage kind of Instagram

200
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,680
prowl 2016 James wouldn't really

201
00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:00,569
recommend for that but it is possible if

202
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,879
you want to do that okay so she just

203
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:03,990
fully hosted very very like straight all

204
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:05,490
the way through once we have the shape

205
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:07,319
all outlined I'm gonna grab the shade of

206
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,490
blonde of dipbrow which I definitely

207
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:10,289
should have used to out what I just

208
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:12,509
couldn't find it and now I did um and

209
00:06:10,289 --> 00:06:13,650
also the shade Albert as well it kind of

210
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:14,849
mixed them a little bit together just

211
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:16,259
because the brown so does definitely

212
00:06:14,849 --> 00:06:17,849
have like strawberry blonde type of hair

213
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:19,139
and coincidentally so is the week that I

214
00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:20,520
have for later on it so I just so make

215
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:22,500
sure everything matches its going to

216
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,669
lightly feather that color in there okay

217
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,199
I'm gonna clear this table concealer in

218
00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:26,669
a second but this is looking pretty good

219
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,229
so far so I'm gonna try my best to

220
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:30,360
mirror this on the other side they are

221
00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:32,159
not even okay let me just conceal this

222
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,659
before I go crazy and then we'll worry

223
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:35,189
about reshaping okay I don't go to take

224
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:36,810
shave tape and this is in the shade fair

225
00:06:35,189 --> 00:06:38,819
beige just like a little bit of a

226
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:40,919
lighter under Brown moment gonna blend

227
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:42,000
this up using a mac 242 brush now that

228
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:43,229
that is all looking and really really

229
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,979
good and I definitely do not want to

230
00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:45,509
change out I'm gonna grab some

231
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:47,550
translucent powder once again in a

232
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:49,289
powder puff and I'm going to lock this

233
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:50,039
in place now that the brows are all set

234
00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:51,750
and not going anywhere

235
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:53,729
thank God we get to move on to the fun

236
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:57,210
part which is going to be the eyes now

237
00:06:53,729 --> 00:06:58,469
this is obviously going to be a lot so

238
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:59,909
before I actually go in and put anything

239
00:06:58,469 --> 00:07:01,589
on I do want to go ahead and try to

240
00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:03,419
sketch this out just my face kind of

241
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:04,949
lightly just we get kind of like a

242
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:06,900
general idea of where this is gonna go

243
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:08,550
so I don't look really really stupid

244
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,620
wiping it off later on I'm just gonna

245
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:12,839
grab a regular Anasazi eyebrow pencil

246
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:15,330
and I'm going to start doing this okay

247
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:17,159
so I'm debating if I want to do like the

248
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:20,099
anime eye where people actually draw in

249
00:07:17,159 --> 00:07:21,750
the pupil on the lower lash line or just

250
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:23,819
expand the white I probably should draw

251
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:27,000
on the eye I'm gonna continue my upper

252
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:29,339
lash line down to right about there just

253
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,529
imagining like the liner and then it's

254
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:33,180
gonna come to about here like I said I'm

255
00:07:31,529 --> 00:07:34,469
just like lightly sketching this into

256
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,909
definitely does it have to be perfect

257
00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:37,620
I'm obviously going to cover this all up

258
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:39,240
but I just want to kind of get a rough

259
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:41,610
idea okay

260
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:44,540
the winged liner will be will come up to

261
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:46,820
here okay and then winged liner going up

262
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:50,600
there we go okay so when later we'll be

263
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:52,370
like right here yeah okay not bad so far

264
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,740
that I need to put in her like actually

265
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:57,290
defined crease which looks like it's

266
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:59,180
about I don't know I shouldn't put the

267
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:01,160
crease in my actual crease no no no no

268
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:02,780
no that'll ruin the illusion so I'm

269
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,040
gonna draw the crease higher than my

270
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:06,140
regular crease but we're gonna actually

271
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,180
like draw a black line in there and make

272
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:08,690
it look like it's a new crease does that

273
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,400
make sense

274
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:11,990
that's it that's the shape right there

275
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,250
so this is the shape of one on kind of

276
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,690
all mapped out obviously we're going to

277
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:16,910
add a shadow and like always I'm gonna

278
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:18,380
do one eye at a time but just make sure

279
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:19,490
everything looks kind of symmetrical in

280
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:21,170
the end I'm gonna go ahead and knock

281
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:22,640
this one out quickly and then move on to

282
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:24,260
the eye shadow so give me once again I

283
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:27,670
think I want to start off with the I set

284
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:29,750
off first and then do the outlines later

285
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:31,130
hopefully that doesn't mess me up but

286
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,990
I'm gonna grab of course the James house

287
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:34,490
X morphe palette and I'm gonna dip into

288
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:35,900
the shade at boutique and use this and

289
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:37,280
layer that's all over the lid gonna lay

290
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:39,290
down some Mac Paint Pot in the shade of

291
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,570
painterly on the lid then bringing this

292
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:43,970
all the way down to my nose area as well

293
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:45,830
then is packing on a boutique with an m1

294
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:47,510
to floor brush this is literally the

295
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:49,280
perfect color for this look I'm

296
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,730
literally just filling in this entire

297
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,230
area

298
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:53,240
this is definitely gonna be one of those

299
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:55,010
looks that looks so wrong until it gets

300
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,090
right you guys have no idea how excited

301
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:58,010
I was to be doing this challenge today

302
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:59,960
oh my god I don't look like a [ __ ]

303
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:01,780
before on my channel but I used to play

304
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:03,890
it with a black and Barbie dolls

305
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:05,270
religiously as a little boy I don't they

306
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:07,130
actually make it anymore but I used to

307
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:08,390
have this brought styling head thing

308
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:10,430
that was literally just a gigantic a

309
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:11,510
broad stalk with like a long hair they

310
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:12,950
literally just sit there and play with

311
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:14,750
it and do its hair all day long and

312
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:16,100
different braids and updos and styles I

313
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,450
remember one time actually drawing on

314
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,460
the Barbie head with pencils too and

315
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:21,410
getting screamed at by my mom who was so

316
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:22,550
mad that I mess up her poor face but in

317
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:23,900
my five-year-old had a house making her

318
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:25,100
beautiful but I just think it's so funny

319
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,720
that literally brought stalls is how I

320
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,860
actually learned how to do hair and a

321
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,930
later on in life I actually started

322
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:31,730
doing hair for girls for prom and ball

323
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:33,230
and then my love for hair send it to me

324
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:34,940
a love for makeup so like in a really

325
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:36,980
weird way without Bratz dolls I might

326
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:38,900
not even be doing this job today

327
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:40,940
it's so cool helpful circle that is

328
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:42,530
right now I'm using lob down an m4 3 3

329
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:43,670
by the way to buff out that edge next

330
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:46,410
we're going to shade it you're kidding

331
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:47,970
on an m4 3 3 and just pop this on

332
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:49,770
just to kind of lighten it up a little

333
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:51,000
bit I noticed in the original picture

334
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:52,860
I brought sell definitely had a little

335
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,080
bit more of a light lit compared to her

336
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:57,510
crease and I forgot to do that so oops

337
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:59,910
okay so now I want to do her eye liner

338
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:02,100
I'm gonna grab the next liquid liner in

339
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:03,660
black and I'm going to use this to start

340
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,040
sketching out keep in mind we obviously

341
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,480
have this gets going too so I'm actually

342
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,920
not gonna start my eyeliner at the

343
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,720
normal place we're gonna pull that from

344
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,850
the outer edge and pull it back and then

345
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,590
we're gonna sketch it in and fill in the

346
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:15,210
lines he's gonna look really stupid at

347
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:17,280
first but just have patience this

348
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:19,140
eyeliner line needs to come down here so

349
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:22,110
now I have to draw like the little D

350
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:24,630
like crease oh god here we go okay so

351
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:25,530
this is going like here this is so hard

352
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:27,090
holy crap

353
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:28,410
now for the bottom I'm gonna start by

354
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:29,910
grabbing the Jeffrey's our liquid

355
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:32,130
lipstick in the shade a drug lord this

356
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:34,350
is a really great white kind of product

357
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:37,110
we're gonna use and I'm gonna just

358
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:38,820
basically fill my eyeball and looking

359
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:41,550
good so far and I'm also gonna put this

360
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:44,100
in my waterline as well this is so

361
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:45,630
creepy looking oh okay I'm just gonna

362
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,310
have a little bit of a flashback from of

363
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:48,990
course DJ halls palette I'm just the

364
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:50,550
flat packing brush and set that right in

365
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:51,930
place now I'm gonna grab the black liner

366
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,520
once again we're gonna outline the

367
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:55,740
bottom of the eye

368
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,660
who's gonna follow that eyeliner oh my

369
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:59,460
god okay it's starting to come together

370
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,930
great okay I'm gonna add more cranberry

371
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:02,340
on eyeshadow and lashes of course later

372
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:05,370
on but I'm going to do that after the

373
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:07,050
base um so now I think I have to draw in

374
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:08,850
the eyeball okay so this is where things

375
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:10,260
get tricky so now we have to do like the

376
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:12,030
whole illusion part which is basically

377
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:14,130
making my eyes look like they are huge

378
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:15,150
we're already running into one issue of

379
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:16,470
this is that when you do this you're

380
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:18,360
supposed to wear a circle lenses which

381
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:20,910
are basically just really really large

382
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,200
contacts I can't wear those because they

383
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:23,910
wasn't actually able to find any that

384
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,890
come in prescription and a lot of

385
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:27,960
prescription I can't see anything so

386
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:29,100
this Barbie would have looked botched um

387
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,480
therefore we're just gonna have to make

388
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,100
it work I'm going to Photoshop the

389
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,510
picture that I post on Instagram heads

390
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,740
up as if I don't Photoshop every other

391
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:36,360
picture anyway we're gonna have to do

392
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:38,010
your best to visualize it but regardless

393
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,360
we're drawing on another eyeball to make

394
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:41,730
it look like my eyes are bigger when I

395
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,560
do this I'm going to look forward I also

396
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:44,730
have very long lower eyelashes which is

397
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,990
going to make this illusion even more

398
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:47,280
difficult because they're going to get

399
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:47,790
in the way I have to paint them as well

400
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:51,870
so

401
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:53,579
lord help me great house looks good now

402
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:56,550
I'm going to fill this in with a white

403
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:58,019
brown color to match my contacts gonna

404
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:00,180
grab an Emma 2:30 brush and dip into the

405
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:01,800
chain to punch me in the palate then I'm

406
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:04,860
gonna have a little bit of tea and use

407
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:07,079
this to shade the what is this this is

408
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:12,089
the iris the iris okay now I have to

409
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:14,160
draw in the new people okay

410
00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:15,269
now I just need a white dot alright and

411
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,889
finally last up I'm just gonna grab a

412
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:20,010
tiny little pencil brush this is the e30

413
00:12:16,889 --> 00:12:22,380
7 and the tiniest tiniest tiniest

414
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:23,610
tiniest little bit of spooky and used on

415
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:26,070
the back of my hand just rub on any

416
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:32,250
excess and then use this too lightly

417
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:34,139
shade all right sisters so I know this

418
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:36,300
absolutely looks crazy right now

419
00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:37,949
but this is pretty much the illusion all

420
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,779
complete all we have left is like the

421
00:12:37,949 --> 00:12:41,130
lashes and the lower lash line but I

422
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:42,480
don't want to do this until later on

423
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:44,490
once I have my face and foundation

424
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,769
already on so I'm just gonna crack for a

425
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:48,360
second or probably rather a good hour or

426
00:12:46,769 --> 00:12:50,310
so and try my absolute best to mirror

427
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,839
this eye over to this side I feel like

428
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:53,339
symmetry is very very important when it

429
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,529
comes to Bratz dolls and really just

430
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:58,139
recreating all dolls so wish me luck and

431
00:12:55,529 --> 00:12:59,930
I'll be right back oh my god you guys

432
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:01,829
look at this

433
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:03,240
we're still missing the watch then the

434
00:13:01,829 --> 00:13:04,709
lower lashline shadow but it's

435
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,730
definitely trying to come together oh my

436
00:13:04,709 --> 00:13:07,199
god I'm so excited

437
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:10,079
I just never honestly like pulling this

438
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:11,220
off at least kind of so now just going

439
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,990
to do the rest of everything else so I'm

440
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,339
gonna grab my krylon TV paint stick once

441
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:18,060
again and now we're just gonna lay down

442
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:19,260
the kind of base all over and I saved

443
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:21,990
this for later just because obviously we

444
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:23,790
have a new set of eyes now so I had to

445
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:25,560
kind of put that around back okay and I

446
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:30,480
was gonna buff this in once again this

447
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:33,329
is so this is also kind of scary low-key

448
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,130
oh my god okay so now we're gonna grab

449
00:13:33,329 --> 00:13:35,399
once again of the white that we use to

450
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:36,870
highlight

451
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:39,029
earlier and I'm gonna use this to add in

452
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:40,230
some highlights to the face I'm gonna

453
00:13:39,029 --> 00:13:42,149
keep this very centered in like the

454
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:43,949
middle of the face I'm just having my

455
00:13:42,149 --> 00:13:45,580
face exactly like normal except just a

456
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:48,970
little bit lower underneath

457
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:51,190
eyes right up along that lash line this

458
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:57,520
is so crazy now I'm going to upon this

459
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:59,140
out okay I set this now more powder this

460
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:02,140
I keep looking in the monitor and

461
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:04,270
getting shocked this is so crazy

462
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:05,620
oh my gosh now that the face is all set

463
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:07,450
we were looking a little bit flat and I

464
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:08,680
want to add in some dimension now

465
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:09,940
looking at this photo the brazo doesn't

466
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,440
really have that much contour or

467
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:13,480
highlight going on it's mostly just a

468
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,160
little bit of a blush but that is

469
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,710
because it is a doll with a perfect face

470
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,640
shape um I don't really have that so

471
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:20,230
therefore I'm going to contour a little

472
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,820
bit more to kind of round everything out

473
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:24,130
but I'm gonna try to keep it a little

474
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:26,110
bit more subtle then we'll see how that

475
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:27,700
actually works just cover my Anasazi out

476
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:29,380
contour kit gonna kind of hit this a

477
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,520
little bit more rounded than normal kind

478
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:32,230
of pulling this in a little bit lower

479
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:34,000
still going to contour my jawline so it

480
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:34,390
looks like I got liposuction for a real

481
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,590
one

482
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:37,420
just because Bratz dolls definitely do

483
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:39,100
have a very very distinctive facial

484
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:40,840
shape and I'm just going to try to round

485
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,890
out my forehead as much as possible

486
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,570
same thing with the nose contour

487
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:46,420
definitely not a lot going on but then

488
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:49,420
again doll nose is definitely nowhere

489
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:51,790
near this baby right here so we're gonna

490
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:54,100
try our best to contour definitely try

491
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:55,810
to emphasize like the ball on the end of

492
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:57,760
the nose I want to make the sides look

493
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:59,500
really tiny so I'm gonna put this the

494
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,150
lines here and then blend them up into

495
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,230
the eyeshadow okay so this is probably

496
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:04,600
like the best we're gonna get the nose

497
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:06,910
contour I already work miracles with my

498
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,050
regular boy and makeup doing a whole lot

499
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:10,840
of nose country and a whole lot of face

500
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:12,160
tuned there's no saving this so we're

501
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,200
just gonna have to go with it and hope

502
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,490
for the best but next is blush so I'm

503
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,060
gonna grab the Kylie blush in the shade

504
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:17,530
of pink

505
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:19,840
power this one is so cute from her new

506
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:21,520
collection and the morphe of 4 brush I

507
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,570
normally don't go over like more pinky

508
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,130
tone blushes you guys know I love a good

509
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:26,740
quarrel on that but I think this is

510
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:28,150
going to match the look so well open it

511
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:30,010
does and we thought this is so pretty

512
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:31,450
and once again being very very rounded

513
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:33,970
with this shape kind of pulling it down

514
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:34,930
and inwards now that I had that all in

515
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:36,430
place I'm gonna go ahead and bake my

516
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:37,690
face like normal but instead of my

517
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:39,730
irregular powder I'm going to use the

518
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:41,350
been night super white powder now this

519
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,790
stuff is very very intense but we

520
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:45,100
definitely are going for a very high

521
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:46,720
contrast type of look today so I'm just

522
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:49,200
going to grab once again at my same at

523
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,700
Beauty wonderin tip it right in

524
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:53,220
I'm gonna press that powder right up

525
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:54,750
against the sides of this nose and this

526
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:56,340
might help a little bit with the contour

527
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,870
illusion well we know we're crossing our

528
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:59,490
fingers and well that's it sir let's go

529
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:00,810
ahead and work on the lower lash line

530
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:02,460
I'm gonna grab a tiny little buffing

531
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:04,560
brush and dipping into a boutique just

532
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,940
like before we're going to go in and

533
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,520
we're going to blend that right along

534
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:10,050
the lower edge of the liner and I'm

535
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,430
gonna keep this very very tight to that

536
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:12,960
line as well because the Brachfeld

537
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:14,460
definitely does not blend hers down very

538
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:16,170
far I'm gonna use an even tiny little

539
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:18,300
buffing brush dip into the littlest bit

540
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:20,970
of spooky and use that to blend together

541
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:22,050
deep black liner and boutique then it's

542
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:23,730
never gonna have about four or five six

543
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:25,320
my tiny little custom blending brush and

544
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:27,090
dipping into a little bit of love that

545
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,920
it's going to blend out that outer edge

546
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:30,420
I'm just realizing now too for the

547
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,310
crease that I put in I just drew a line

548
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:33,360
but in a real eye crease obviously

549
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:35,190
there's like a tiny little bit of shadow

550
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,200
can't leave out any details we want this

551
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:38,880
look as realistic as possible I'm just

552
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:41,070
gonna go into a 506 person took it to a

553
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,330
little bit more spooky time off the

554
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:44,250
excess because I want this to be a very

555
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:45,900
very tiny detail but I'm just gonna go

556
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:49,020
over that crease line and just blend

557
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:50,970
very very lightly as if there is a

558
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:52,530
shadow because I'm a fold further laughs

559
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:53,760
I'm gonna glue on my lash it to the top

560
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:55,530
in a quick second but for the bronze

561
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:57,330
bottom lashes she actually has it three

562
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:58,830
tiny little spikes so I'm gonna draw

563
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:03,980
those in using a liquid eyeliner this

564
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:05,940
one is from a Tom Ford that looks so bad

565
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:07,680
I'm not really sure what I can do about

566
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:10,079
that okay if I clean up with consider it

567
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:17,730
right now without this is so hard

568
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:19,110
oh no okay that's better than nothing

569
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:21,959
now to make them even on the other side

570
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:24,660
oh I didn't know where I want to put the

571
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:26,400
lashes on my actual eyelids because I'm

572
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:28,050
not really gonna use a good at 3:01

573
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,060
these are from the crime shop I love

574
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:31,290
them they're super super just like big

575
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:32,820
these are what I usually use for drawing

576
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:34,620
because of the fact we put the white

577
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:36,510
here and the eyeliner starts here

578
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:38,100
technically the outer edge of my eyelash

579
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:39,990
should be like here which is where I

580
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:42,060
should glue the lash but I feel like

581
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:43,740
this wrong side because if I feel like

582
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:46,160
my eyeliner is there it just like will

583
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,160
look really

584
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,040
what the hot why does it look at that

585
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:52,020
okay so to fix that last night it took a

586
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,370
little bit of hairspray this is the got

587
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:55,260
to be glue that I always used to really

588
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:56,640
lock my normal hair in place I just

589
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,200
sprayed out the lash and then pinch them

590
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,000
together

591
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,529
look a little bit more like spidery doll

592
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,519
like hopefully this will look a little

593
00:18:00,529 --> 00:18:03,409
bit better

594
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:04,940
I don't really know so we're gonna

595
00:18:03,409 --> 00:18:07,309
figure out together I also don't really

596
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:15,169
know where I'm gonna put this lash kind

597
00:18:07,309 --> 00:18:17,210
of put the inner corner that looks good

598
00:18:15,169 --> 00:18:19,340
well that worked way better than

599
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:26,029
anticipated oh my god well I'm so sated

600
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:28,309
okay great oh these look like freakin a

601
00:18:26,029 --> 00:18:30,139
smile from em first

602
00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:32,269
alright you guys this is Lily look at

603
00:18:30,139 --> 00:18:34,190
you so good and also so creepy at the

604
00:18:32,269 --> 00:18:35,690
same time I've ready to move on to the

605
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:37,490
next step those of the eyes literally

606
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:42,220
all complete like I said the lashes

607
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:44,120
definitely pulled it all together oh I

608
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:46,039
can't believe I actually pulled this off

609
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,570
oh my god okay I'm gonna go ahead and

610
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:49,130
wipe off this baby it's been sitting

611
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:50,539
because it's been really sitting there

612
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:52,760
for quite a while now and I don't want

613
00:18:50,539 --> 00:18:54,380
to get crusted for Holly we're gonna

614
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,850
keep it relatively subtle and going with

615
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:57,230
a little bit of a face for my palate

616
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:59,210
actually really use regular Einstein

617
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:01,460
once again keeping that very rounded

618
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:03,679
shape going here gonna bring a little

619
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:05,630
bit of that down the nose as well as

620
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,919
always also it might distract a little

621
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:08,240
bit for everything else going on sounds

622
00:19:06,919 --> 00:19:09,470
good oh nice then all we get to do the

623
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,299
fun part which is of course going to be

624
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:12,799
the ellipse at the last and final stop

625
00:19:11,299 --> 00:19:13,970
this is going to be a really good and

626
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,590
fresh because we get to over line the

627
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:17,809
crap out of them I'm gonna try my best

628
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:20,720
model of this video so their lips come

629
00:19:17,809 --> 00:19:22,309
up my mouth is very very very wide and

630
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,279
large if you haven't noticed over the

631
00:19:22,309 --> 00:19:27,830
course last few years quite a lot comes

632
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:29,389
out of it both good and bad but a big

633
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:30,710
mouth is a problem when you have a tiny

634
00:19:29,389 --> 00:19:34,600
little Barbie mouth away the very large

635
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:34,600
lip so I'm just gonna have to pose like

636
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:42,419
[Music]

637
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:43,740
now I'm going to use the jeffree star

638
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:45,900
cosmetics liquid lipstick in the shade

639
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:47,250
of a birthday suit to fill this end and

640
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,870
then grabbing a little bit of it drug

641
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:50,250
lord and then just like I did with that

642
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:51,270
tiny little white line and the pupil of

643
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:53,520
the eye I'm just gonna use the same

644
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:58,080
exact method to add on little highlights

645
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:59,940
to literally six hours later I think

646
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,700
that is the makeup portion of this look

647
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:04,110
all complete I'm obsessed with how this

648
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,340
turned out I was so scared at first I

649
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:07,110
did not know if this was going to turn

650
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:08,730
out even remotely okay this is probably

651
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:11,580
one of the hardest looks I've ever done

652
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:12,870
but I am so credibly proud of this but

653
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,669
but look it's not over yet because we

654
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:17,159
still have a lot of transforming left

655
00:20:14,669 --> 00:20:19,230
still to do as you can tell so I'm gonna

656
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:20,820
go off camera quickly put on my wigs at

657
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:22,470

really nervous not gonna lie obviously I

697
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,680
do like creative artistic makeup looks

698
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:03,690
all the time but I've never actually

699
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:05,580
tried to turn my face into another face

700
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:07,020
of four and realistic transformations is

701
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:09,330
definitely something that I do not have

702
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:10,800
any experience with but that being said

703
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:12,540
I was so excited because Bronson Barbies

704
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:14,520
were a major part of my childhood in the

705
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:16,290
making of a gay icon I mean I literally

706
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:17,940
learned how to braid on an actual brass

707
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:19,770
styling head and I used to do their

708
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:20,970
makeup all the time and that love for

709
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:22,710
creativity and making people feel

710
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:25,050
