126
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:32,879
ugliest word in the world and I consider

127
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:34,949

133
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:46,739
is a huge weight on my shoulders but I'm

134
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:48,449
very very blessed to have the

135
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:50,369
opportunity of being a role model for a

136
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:51,080
ton of people so I love to be able to

137
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:54,379

139
00:06:54,379 --> 00:07:00,379
so what's your favorite part of having a

140
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:01,849
platform um sorry people I feel like my

141
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:05,710
favorite part is getting messages from a

142
00:07:01,849 --> 00:07:05,710
little boy something inside of them

143
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:12,199
that's amazing but do you ever think

144
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:14,090
there will ever be a day where it's

145
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:18,620
equally as common for every single

146
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:21,560
gender to wear makeup hmm that's a lot

147
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:23,330
honestly I do think so but I think it's

148
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,129
definitely going to take a while

149
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:26,659
unfortunately we do still live in a

150
00:07:25,129 --> 00:07:28,789
society with very very having

151
00:07:26,659 --> 00:07:30,080
stereotypes but because of beauty

152
00:07:28,789 --> 00:07:31,789
bloggers like myself and more and more

153
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,199
brands working towards gender equality

154
00:07:31,789 --> 00:07:34,460
I do think they'll be a day in the

155
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,550
future where everybody gets rockin

156
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:39,590
