am very very nice like mortified I'm

78
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,830
doing this mostly because like YouTube

79
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:05,380

80
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:07,330
digital space and there's not that much

81
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:10,600

83
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,840

was working on in my videos is deleting

90
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:26,500
that boundary and really making effort

91
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:28,720

really exciting so I'll be at the table

104
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:58,400
I probably say the scariest part of the

105
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:00,010
red carpet oh hey you know once you get

106
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,150

to be honest no one's really even eating

110
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:10,040
the city after see might've just kind of

111
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:12,080
like socializing say hi to people so but

112
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:14,419
the carpet is pretty I mean every year

00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:47,300
opportunities that may be outside of the

187
00:11:39,319 --> 00:11:49,670
YouTube world obviously and I just spent

188
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:51,529
a competent for YouTube and the business

189
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:53,480
side of saying that's the million times

190
00:11:51,529 --> 00:11:55,550
so like it's really exciting that that

191
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:58,490
there you must get to be half okay so

192
00:11:55,550 --> 00:12:00,019
for Lily and Liza I don't know what does

193
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:02,029
it mean for you guys

194
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:04,129
I guess Rosa do this we can see here in

195
00:12:02,029 --> 00:12:06,679
respective what does it mean for like us

196
00:12:04,129 --> 00:12:08,749
as youtubers to be in my because this is

197
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:11,029
a very special moment I think those are

198
00:12:08,749 --> 00:12:12,079
you to the sauce you better go yeah it

199
00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:13,429
was nerve-wracking because I was not

200
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,529
myself but it's Sun comforting to have

201
00:12:13,429 --> 00:12:17,089
like like that's a it's a breaking

202
00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:18,259
moment like for social media like I

203
00:12:17,089 --> 00:12:19,610
think like social media has been so

204
00:12:18,259 --> 00:12:21,589
heavily incorporated into this year

205
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:23,269
because they realize the value that it

206
00:12:21,589 --> 00:12:25,670
brings you I'm like everybody's talking

207
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:27,350
about it there's reviews like it's so

208
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:28,999
fine so to be able to have us there

209
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:31,629
we're representing a community that has

210
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:33,649
been like not undermine but has been

211
00:12:31,629 --> 00:12:36,230
undermined just slowly means that

212
00:12:33,649 --> 00:12:38,630
they're getting up yeah

213
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:39,860
by God is already in existence one of

214
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,060
the things that I am most scared about

215
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:43,190
because I will about like I am

216
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:45,920
definitely my comments get to me a lot

217
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:47,150
and I know and this talk to save I know

218
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,470
the secretary shell public coverage are

219
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:50,810
there going to be pictures being like

220
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:52,640
some previous living around with two

221
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:53,960
hundred thousand by approximately who

222
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,700
like who invited James Charles like who

223
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:58,700
like each other's on to the carb and I'm

224
00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:01,160
trying to brace myself for it because I

225
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:04,010
think you have every right to be this so

226
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:06,230
much so like the theme is so you and I

227
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:08,900
think like everything that you guys have

228
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:10,760
built and it's exactly what Billy said

229
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:12,860
it's about the world Pride weekend you

230
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:16,250
know you're second there's so much to

231
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:17,990
embrace about you and so much like every

232
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:20,120
reason that you guys should be them also

233
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:22,280
than some of the other people there's a

234
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:24,020
familiarity philosophically for a second

235
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,670
it's like you know this and I know it's

236
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:27,140
hard to implement but I know you know

237
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:28,550
this that the people that are saying who

238
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,710
let them in the carpet also people that

239
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:34,190
secretly want to be on the carpet

240
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:35,540
okay so you have to like know that when

241
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:37,280
you read that tweet you have to know

242
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:39,140
that this is not about weasel this

243
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:41,990
person yeah that's you know thanks but

244
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:43,460
there's nothing to do with you yeah

245
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:45,170
so one thing bad what you literally has

246
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:49,370
nothing to do with you and everything

247
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:55,040
but someone else thinks of you smelly no

248
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:56,450
business yes how they speak of you is

249
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,860
what speaks of them when it's true

250
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:59,510
that's who they are I mean this is just

251
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,970
such a special moment for all of us and

252
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:04,480
I just want to be able to enjoy it and

253
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:04,480
this was great advice

254
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:17,230
[Applause]

255
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:20,410
good morning you guys it is Monday May 6

256
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:23,320
2019 the first Monday in May today

257
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:24,850
yessum that gala and we're about to get

258
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,230
ready um I went to bed last night and

259
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:27,730
literally 4:00 in the morning I could

260
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:31,000
not fall asleep and I ended up waking up

261
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:32,470
today at noon noon I'm not done that

262
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,779
since I was already in like eighth grade

263
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:37,149
so feels good to be well-rested I feel

264
00:14:34,779 --> 00:14:38,410
like I am ready to conquer this day but

265
00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:40,420
I don't have a few hours to get ready

266
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:41,769
now so we're going to sit down and get

267
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:43,660
clam as you can see we're already

268
00:14:41,769 --> 00:14:45,279
running into our first dilemma here with

269
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:46,930
my alpha that you guys clearly saw I

270
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:49,329
don't really have a shirt on underneath

271
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:51,279
the chainmail I'm gonna be wearing

272
00:14:49,329 --> 00:14:54,339
meaning my foundation has to match

273
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:56,649
perfectly to my body and we already know

274
00:14:54,339 --> 00:14:58,690
it's not going to try to get as close as

275
00:14:56,649 --> 00:14:59,680
possible I just went ahead and swatch a

276
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:01,660
few of the different ones that I brought

277
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,920
with me and none of them are really

278
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:05,199
matching so don't really know what to do

279
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:07,149
oh this one from Dior match is really

280
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,769
really really well on the neck like it

281
00:15:07,149 --> 00:15:11,440
almost as like blending in did you are

282
00:15:08,769 --> 00:15:13,810
air flash but on my face looks a little

283
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,699
light like pasty and pay off whereas

284
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:17,829
this one on my face I feel like it's

285
00:15:15,699 --> 00:15:20,079
looking a little bit more good or just

286
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:21,850
to face in this a dusty shell but on my

287
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,470
neck it looks a little bit not good

288
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:25,540
we're just gonna blend it really far

289
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:27,220
down really far down and hope that it

290
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:29,050
works or they can like mix the two them

291
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:30,970
together I'm very nervous as you can

292
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:33,130

293
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:34,990

00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:37,269
actually happening this is so crazy and

295
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:40,300

in place

330
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:52,420
I'm powdered and literally everything in

331
00:16:51,249 --> 00:16:54,220
existence because I don't want to sweat

332
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:55,749
anything off but then again it's like

333
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:58,059
kind of cold in New York right now it's

334
00:16:55,749 --> 00:17:00,579
not fully summertime yet and also I have

335
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:03,249
no shirt on underneath the chainmail so

336
00:17:00,579 --> 00:17:05,470
I'm gonna be freezing I'm not gonna grab

337
00:17:03,249 --> 00:17:08,140
my crotch or cat and search literally on

338
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:10,059
my face I am very nervous for this as

339
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:11,709
you can tell by me not talking which is

340
00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:13,419
a rare sight for a James Rollins YouTube

341
00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:14,919
video as much as I'm so excited and

342
00:17:13,419 --> 00:17:17,589
blessed and thankful and grateful and

343
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:18,699
pumped to be there there's still a part

344
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:20,559
of me that literally feels like I just

345
00:17:18,699 --> 00:17:22,990
started doing all this yesterday and

346
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,789
that I'm still nobody just a random kid

347
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:26,649
living in the middle of New York with

348
00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:29,260
very little friends and just working

349
00:17:26,649 --> 00:17:31,299
hard in school and it feels so surreal

350
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:32,409
this is actually like my life and then

351
00:17:31,299 --> 00:17:33,580
I'm getting invited to these favorite

352
00:17:32,409 --> 00:17:34,960
things and then I get to walk red

353
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:36,490
carpets with like celebrities that I've

354
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,710
looked up to and watched and I was a

355
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:40,179
little kid so this is really really

356
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:41,830
weird I was dealing back and forth with

357
00:17:40,179 --> 00:17:43,840
a few celebrities that are friends with

358
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:45,309
that I know have gone for several years

359
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,440
and of course nobody's getting away the

360
00:17:45,309 --> 00:17:48,580
full details of their outfits but what

361
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,820
I've heard is that everyone is like

362
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:53,919
going so crazy and like I want to go so

363
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:56,230
crazy but I'm like so scared

364
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,429
ah I'm usually never my head about

365
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:58,809
anything like I'd really really don't

366
00:17:57,429 --> 00:18:02,830
get nervous but I feel like this is such

367
00:17:58,809 --> 00:18:04,090
just a crazy thing I'm sister scarran

368
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:06,490
I'm sister scarran but you know what

369
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:08,700
it's gonna be fun day I think my talk

370
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:11,289
last night at dinner was like so

371
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,940
incredible with Liza and lily and Rosie

372
00:18:11,289 --> 00:18:14,860
and Susan and I really feel like they

373
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:16,539
helped me call my nerves so much about

374
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,620
the whole event like if I was to walk

375
00:18:16,539 --> 00:18:17,950
out of that chair and go right to the

376
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,570
gala

377
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:21,940
it would've been fine but now I've had

378
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:23,409
like 12 hours to sleep on it and get

379
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:25,570
back into my head and continue thinking

380
00:18:23,409 --> 00:18:28,330
it's a harsh

381
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:29,620
nose contour oh wow all right you guys

382
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:31,090
I'm gonna go into my brows quickly

383
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:32,770
off-camera with my Anasazi eyebrow

384
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:34,660
products as always and I'll be right

385
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:36,130
back to start off the eye makeup so now

386
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:37,930
it's time for the eye makeup which like

387
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:39,100
everything else I'm a little bit

388
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:40,900
stressed about for a few different

389
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:42,640
reasons if you guys saw in the first

390
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:44,650
thing Alexander suggested that he wanted

391
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,940
to see me in a black smokey eye for a

392
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:47,170
potential makeup look to pair with the

393
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:48,460
Wardrobe now if you look through my

394
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:51,250
Instagram you would notice that I don't

395
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:53,080
really do black smokey eyes really ever

396
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:54,700
I don't really putting block in my

397
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:56,440
waterlines because it kind of irritates

398
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:58,270
them sometimes and I must prefer a nude

399
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:00,610
or white to really open them up and make

400
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:03,700
my eyes appear bigger it's just like the

401
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:04,690
look that I am really used to so this is

402
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,100
gonna be a little bit different for me

403
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:07,690
last night when I got home from the

404
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,490
party I did a kind of play on some

405
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:10,960
makeup and I experiment it I did a black

406
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:13,240
smoky eye on one eye and then kind of

407
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,770
like a rainbow splatter paint look on

408
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,660
the other eye too soon as this year's

409
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:18,550
theme is camp and it's very extravagant

410
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:20,860
and outside of the box and I proposed at

411
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:22,450
Alexander and he said no still on the

412
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,710
black smokey eye and I definitely wanna

413
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:25,570
respect his wishes and make sure that my

414
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:27,610
whole look is part of his vision and

415
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:29,350
also to the whole like theme of camp is

416
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:30,910
outside of the box and for me as someone

417
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:32,730
who does extravagant makeup ups all the

418
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:34,870
time a black smoky eye kind of is

419
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:37,180
outside of my box in a very very weird

420
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:38,050
way so it might work fingers crossed

421
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:40,150
I'm first gonna go ahead and grab a

422
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:42,100
punch me at the cool tonot brothel is

423
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:44,410
how it on a fluffy brush and start

424
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:45,970
running this in the crease just to lay

425
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:47,530
down a little bit of a transition color

426
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:49,900
and then I'm just gonna grab a tea with

427
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:51,790
an AB 514 brush and use us to deepen up

428
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,840
the crease make sure that's nice and

429
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:54,970
blend it out with a little bit more

430
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:57,430
punch me using an Emma 508 brush I'm

431
00:19:54,970 --> 00:20:00,430
just going to sketch out a line I'm just

432
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:02,320
talking some spooky onto my lash line oh

433
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:04,510
yeah look at this

434
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:07,030
I like this I'm gonna chuck some block

435
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:09,520
into the lower waterline and then using

436
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:11,200
the littlest bit of spooky and tea mixed

437
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,120
together I'm just going to very very

438
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,370
lightly blend out that lower lash line

439
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,450
I'm not evenly putting on lower lash

440
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:18,130
line shadow it's really just like

441
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:19,270
setting that liner in place I'm just

442
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:21,070
gonna highlight the problem using a

443
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:23,830
little bit of face and ring light mixed

444
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:25,960
together this is very like a Kim Chi nut

445
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:29,170
gone last year inspired a good smokey

446
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:30,780
liner moment not intentional but loved

447
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:34,090
camera already what happened

448
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:36,460
maybe a little black salon moment this

449
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:38,559
is very like sleek sultry this is

450
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:40,179
outside of my box that is absolutely for

451
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,470
sure I do like this though I think it

452
00:20:40,179 --> 00:20:42,940
was kind of good and fresh and I'm glad

453
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:49,330
that I with Alexander session okay

00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:51,100

lippy I really hope you guys know this

461
00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:04,900
super quick to get ready with me I would

462

never normally do a lot like this but I

463
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:08,830
truly feel so beautiful and so sunny

looking to me right now like Hello I

465
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:12,909
don't think right right now it's just

466
00:21:10,929 --> 00:21:14,289
like this black smokey liner we have

467
00:21:12,909 --> 00:21:15,850
like a little bit of lightness on but

468
00:21:14,289 --> 00:21:17,950
Lin a little bit of more definition in

469
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:19,390
the crease super sultry kind of ended up

470
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:21,309
being inspired by Kim and makeup by

471
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:22,929
Mario unintentionally loved them the

472
00:21:21,309 --> 00:21:24,280
absolute most and love this makeup hook

473
00:21:22,929 --> 00:21:26,320

the way to the back table right now I

505
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,720
know this is an awful angle I can't

506
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:26,670
really accept my arm any further without

507
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,400
breaking any safety pins so you don't

508
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:29,880
have to do with that I'm so nervous

509
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,710
right now

510
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:34,010

514
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,800
type of things literally ever but I

515
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:45,240
don't know why like this is just so

516
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:47,040
intense to me is the look that I would

517
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,210
never do nails that I would never do an

518
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:50,280
outfit that I would never do but I feel

519
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:51,780
really beautiful and I'm just really

520
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:54,090
excited to see a bunch of amazing people

521
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:55,620

forward for youtubers in the community

525
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,740
comments and some negativity after this

526
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:03,150
but you know what just like Lily aligns

527
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,800
we're talking about it's about breaking

528
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:06,540
the boundaries and dealing with that and

529
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:09,929
making it easier for the future people

530
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:11,220

597
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:31,320

the past few years I never in a million

603
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:41,670
years thought that I'd ever be invited

604
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:43,950
to the Met Ball but it's literally

605
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:45,840

me to become below there's definitely

610
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:56,790
quite the mixed reaction on social media

611
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:58,890
I was just reading a few comments and

612
00:27:56,790 --> 00:28:00,840

00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:02,520

and we knew now Frodo is gonna be happy

00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:09,759
about it but I think this is such an

618
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:12,639
amazing step in the right direction for

619
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:15,549
