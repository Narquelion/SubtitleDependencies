1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,640
oMG I cringed so hard when he said he

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:07,200
was that makeup artist seriously no

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,620
you're not lol did you train did you

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,150
study

5
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,230
or go to beauty school now so then

6
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,940
you're not classified as a makeup artist

7
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,320
if you haven't got the certificate and

8
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,700
paper to show it then it doesn't count

9
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,540
you as a makeup artist I would know

10
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,260
because I

11
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:21,500
rashon ever qualified makeup artists

12
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:21,500
he's right

13
00:00:31,369 --> 00:00:37,220
really rashon because my 5.3 million

14
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:40,100
followers and this piece of paper beg to

15
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:41,690
differ hi sisters James Charles here and

16
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,010
welcome back to my youtube channel as

17
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:45,260
I'm sure you guys are very much aware

18
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:47,000
comments are a huge part of the YouTube

19
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:48,260
community I receive thousands and

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,730
thousands and thousands to come up to

21
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,989
every single video mostly from you guys

22
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,580
who are always spreading so much love

23
00:00:50,989 --> 00:00:53,960
and positivity and really make me do

24
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:55,250
what I want to do so thank you for

25
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,110
always being the absolute best but

26
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,790
alongside the love also comes a whole

27
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:00,079
lot of hate comments when I was younger

28
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:01,699
probably the most valuable thing to my

29
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,050
mother ever taught me was if you don't

30
00:01:01,699 --> 00:01:04,519
have anything nice to say don't say

31
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:06,740
anything at all for me personally I

32
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:08,659
don't think I have ever once left a hate

33
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,860
comment on anybody else's content they

34
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:12,080
work really really hard on but

35
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:13,159
apparently that lesson was not talked to

36
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,390
the thousands and thousands and

37
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:16,310
thousands of people who feel that they

38
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:17,960
are just superior beings and that

39
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:19,790
they're unnecessary and rude comments

40
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,110
just need to be heard now don't get me

41
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,369
wrong there's definitely a huge

42
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:24,020
difference between constructive

43
00:01:22,369 --> 00:01:26,060
criticism and hate comments for me

44
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:27,590
personally I love a constructive

45
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:29,240
criticism I did this job every single

46
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:30,830
day for you guys and to inspire you guys

47
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,180
all around the world and if there's any

48
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:33,590
way that I can make my videos better my

49
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:35,659
makeup better my personality better my

50
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:37,070
lighting better I absolutely want to do

51
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:39,229
it and there's a very very nice way to

52
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:40,820
leave positive suggestions but for the

53
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:42,799
most part people don't know how to do

54
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:45,049
that because everyone's ego is just too

55
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,159
large including mine this idea came

56
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:47,179
about how beauty it's know when I was

57
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,100
reading comments I mean do this video

58
00:01:47,179 --> 00:01:51,649
and somebody proceeded there hey comment

59
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:53,390
by literally saying sister James I love

60
00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:55,429
you so much but I just feel like this

61
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:56,780
needed to be fat I then wrote something

62
00:01:55,429 --> 00:01:58,960
very very nice to you to creating myself

63
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:00,229
my hard work and my career needed Oh

64
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,049
Julia

65
00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:06,020
sweetie sno-cones darling pumpkin you

66
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:07,670
needed to write that comment actually um

67
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,990
no nobody asked for your opinion you

68
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:10,729
didn't need to do anything according to

69
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:13,460
this very official piece of paper right

70
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:15,110
here I am clearly a certified MUA but

71
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:16,670
according to the YouTube comments

72
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:18,530
apparently so it's every other person

73
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:20,120
that watches my video so for today I

74
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:22,370
thought it'd be very very fun to do a

75
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,990
video inspired by Yuki where I take a

76
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:25,490
bunch of comments from people that just

77
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:27,020
thought their opinions had to be heard

78
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:29,300
and I'm hi those two my makeup routine

79
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:30,560
because apparently I can't do makeup I

80
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,940
am just so excited to listen to all

81
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,319
these extremely talented and trained

82
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,490
makeup artists tell me exactly what I

83
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:36,170
should be doing for a makeup routine

84
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:38,740
hopefully I'll look so much better than

85
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:41,889
normal and let's just jump right in

86
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,889
[Music]

87
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:46,390
our first step as always is gonna be our

88
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:48,160
foundation and our base routine and I

89
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:50,560
definitely get a lot of comments about

90
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,300
my foundation in every single video I

91
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,010
can definitely admit I'm not the best at

92
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,540
foundation matching so I figured I would

93
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:57,280
take some advice from the comments today

94
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:59,320
this comin comes from Haley and she says

95
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,620
James I love you but your foundation is

96
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:03,640
ten shades too dark you look burnt hmm

97
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,170
I'm just gonna grab a little bit of a

98
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,959
lighter shades today and apply this all

99
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:10,360
over my face oh yeah this is a way of

100
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:11,920
better match for me I think mm-hmm I

101
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,600
mean after all the sister scandals that

102
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,590
I've had the last thing that I want to

103
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,420
add to that list is culture

104
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:18,010
appropriation so thank god we're getting

105
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:19,600
this advice now another one we have

106
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:21,459
heard today is from Maria and she says

107
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,870
is it just me or does anybody else think

108
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:25,180
that this donation sheet is just way too

109
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:27,130
orange and blue boots are shaking oh

110
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,630
yeah looking back I think Maria is

111
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:29,890
definitely right when it comes to this I

112
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:31,060
mean it's not like I've seen every

113
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:33,130
single video that I always like to be a

114
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,750
little bit more tan so thank god she's

115
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,400
putting this out today let me see what I

116
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,810
can look for if I'm not going for more

117
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,860
of an orange foundation I think I need

118
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:40,420
to find something with more of a pink

119
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:43,930
undertone so let me see what I can find

120
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:45,310
you guys oh my god after three years of

121
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:47,530
doing beauty videos I think we've

122
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:49,329
finally officially found the foundation

123
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,890
shade that matches me perfectly it's a

124
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:52,810
miracle this next time it comes from

125
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:54,370
Shelby and she says James you're a doll

126
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:56,049
but sweetie and I'm not saying this to

127
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:57,760
be cruel or critical just the experience

128
00:03:56,049 --> 00:03:59,290
of a viewer of course it would be much

129
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,600
more enjoyable watching if you slow down

130
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:02,920
way down you're talking moving so fast

131
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,720
your energy is so frantic that for

132
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,340
low-key people like me it makes watching

133
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,019
you very very stressful your kinetic

134
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,220
energy is clearly very high and I'm sure

135
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:11,079
that you have to exert a lot of effort

136
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,430
energy to slow it down entertain it but

137
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:14,500
I assure you and make your videos so

138
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:15,670
much more enjoyable between Hyper's be

139
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,019
talking in your thoughts hand movements

140
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,519
featured in camera it's just a bit much

141
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:20,229
hon again I'm not saying this to be mean

142
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:21,280
a cool or critical simply to share my

143
00:04:20,229 --> 00:04:22,810
experience in watching your videos and

144
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,210
give you a little bit of input much love

145
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:26,410
to you sister Shelby Oh see this is a

146
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:27,789
really great example of constructive

147
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:29,350
criticism and I definitely get comments

148
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:30,370
about the speed am I talking a lot so

149
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:31,539
let me see what I can do to really help

150
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,919
you guys out because I've never want to

151
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:36,700
make my videos hard to watch

152
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:39,210
all right guys so my next stop in my

153
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:42,850
beauty routine is going to be the

154
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:48,099
concealer and for today I want to use my

155
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:51,039
tart shave tape and the shade fair I'm

156
00:04:48,099 --> 00:04:55,779
just going to take the wand and apply it

157
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:58,389
to all of the high points of my face I

158
00:04:55,779 --> 00:05:02,020
am just trying a triangle or right

159
00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:04,740
underneath my eyes and kind of filling

160
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:13,719
in a little bit just to bring some more

161
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:17,619
attention to that area I'm just putting

162
00:05:13,719 --> 00:05:23,169
some in the center of my forehead and I

163
00:05:17,619 --> 00:05:27,789
am gonna put a line right down my nose

164
00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:31,960
and then maybe just a little bit on my

165
00:05:27,789 --> 00:05:34,809
chin to cover the five o'clock shadow

166
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:38,789
and then of course just gonna take my

167
00:05:34,809 --> 00:05:38,789
damp Beauty Blender

168
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:53,050
and blend it out this next one comes

169
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,420
from Rebecca and she says holy Sh why

170
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:57,580
are you using so much powder I cannot

171
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:58,900
even imagine how cakey and horrible and

172
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:00,760
growth you look in person

173
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,960
Oh Rebecca I see myself in the mirror

174
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,460
all the time and I think I look pretty

175
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,870
good but I guess it means a lot more

176
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:06,190
coming from you guys who really see me

177
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:10,870
all the time so maybe I'll just write

178
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:12,250
ooh use a little bit less today mmm you

179
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,600
know what I think that's a lot better

180
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,110
Rebecca I think you'll like this one

181
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,250
girl

182
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:16,300
these next comments are some of my

183
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,310
favorites and they are talking about

184
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:20,290
bronzing and contouring this first one

185
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:21,850
comes from Courtney and she says your

186
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:23,740
contour looks way too harsh

187
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:25,870
holy crop why does your forehead look

188
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:28,150
like it got burnt this one comes from

189
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:30,790
Jonathan and he says sweetie your nose

190
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:32,110
contour isn't fooling anybody yes I love

191
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,310
it when you guys leave me nasty comments

192
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:34,990
about the two things that I talk openly

193
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:36,460
about began to care about and try to fix

194
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:38,170
his contouring really means a lot and

195
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,580
does a lot for my self-esteem this last

196
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:42,160
one comes from Brianna and she said

197
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:43,390
you're literally red okay whoo I mean I

198
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,220
thought my contour looked pretty good

199
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:46,390
but clearly we have a lot to fix today

200
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,500
according to these professional anyway

201
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:49,330
so it looks like we need to make my

202
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,830
contour a little bit more cool toned I'm

203
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:53,410
a little bit less harsh and I need to

204
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:55,840
stop contouring my nose so tiny so let's

205
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:59,800
see what we can do oh my god

206
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:01,150
yes slay I'm contouring with the ashes I

207
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,790
both left my self-esteem up to this

208
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:04,840
video and I think it looks so good for

209
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,920
the forehead I definitely I want to look

210
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:10,270
first I guess we're just gonna use like

211
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:11,470
the littlest bit perfect not gonna lie I

212
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:13,300
am a little bit scared and nervous

213
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:14,230
change up my nose contour but I think

214
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,190
Jonathan definitely knows what he's

215
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:19,980
talking about so I'm just gonna give

216
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:24,430
herself a more natural look today ah oh

217
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:27,310
my god wait I actually love it Jonathan

218
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:29,320
thank you so much holy crap I thought my

219
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:31,330
nose was snatched before but how like

220
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,560
this natural bigger the better look I

221
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:34,690
think it's just the way to go from now

222
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,670
on this next one it comes from Orion's R

223
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:37,930
and they said your contour blush is

224
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:39,010
horrible you put way too much blush on

225
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:40,210
so it looks like you've a red cheek on

226
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:41,530
your face and then your contours just a

227
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,640
dark brown line on your face it's barely

228
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,810
even blended so you shouldn't even be a

229
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,250
makeup artist because your face makeup

230
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:48,700
is horrible the only good thing about it

231
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:50,400
is your highlight thank you

232
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:53,830
at least I'm doing one thing right oh

233
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:56,080
yes the haters are all being blinded

234
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:59,479
right now

235
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,680
well we love a stock sister all right

236
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:03,169
guys so next we have the bras which I'm

237
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,190
actually really really excited for have

238
00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:05,449
you been following me for a very long

239
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:07,220
time on Instagram but you know that my

240
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:09,050
brows have underwent such a major

241
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,460
transformation and it's honestly a lot

242
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:12,199
because of you guys and a lot of the

243
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:13,220
hate comments I received at first I just

244
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:15,169
really could not take the conjuncture

245
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:17,210
criticism I thought my brows were so so

246
00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:18,710
so beautiful but finally I realized that

247
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:20,509
there were literally just the worst this

248
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:22,850
first one comes from Baylin Kibeho and

249
00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:24,889
she says bro if you don't fix your brows

250
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:28,190
your eye look is so warm and your brow

251
00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:29,690
color is ashy they're gray okay this one

252
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:31,010
comes from Emily and she says anybody

253
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:32,360
else think that he should really maybe

254
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:34,729
trim his eyebrow hair and make them a

255
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,890
little bit thinner they are so super

256
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:38,209
boxy nothing against him he's so great

257
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:40,339
but I think he would really look much

258
00:08:38,209 --> 00:08:42,890
better smiley face this one comes from

259
00:08:40,339 --> 00:08:45,380
melancholic Mexican there's a scandal

260
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:47,029
these eyebrows are way too thick they're

261
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:49,940
supposed to be thin like skinny legend

262
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:51,800
Mariah Carey true and finally we have

263
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,600
this one from I hate Aloha and she says

264
00:08:51,800 --> 00:09:00,470
boy I think those eyebrows need to be

265
00:08:53,600 --> 00:09:01,760
closer together okay so I definitely

266
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:03,890
don't want my brows to look ashy today

267
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,480
that is a major major nono so instead of

268
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:07,100
my regular brow pencil I grab the Mac

269
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,779
lip pencil in the shade of Burgundy this

270
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,770
was just a little bit more red tone so

271
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:11,180
hopefully it'll match with the I like

272
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:12,110
that I do later on and then according to

273
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,730
everyone else they need to be a little

274
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:14,959
bit more arch a little bit skinnier and

275
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:16,430
closer together you know we're really

276
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,080
going for that look of like raising your

277
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:19,670
eyebrows at all times to show everybody

278
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,320
that I'm very very interested in what

279
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:22,790
they're having to say there we go

280
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,380
super arched definitely a little bit

281
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:28,220
thinner than normal then bring it right

282
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:29,209
back down oh my god yes that looks so

283
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,980
much better than normal

284
00:09:29,209 --> 00:09:32,660
according to I hate Ulua they really

285
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:34,910
should be almost touching because you

286
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:36,680
Nawroz are very much back in style and

287
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:37,880
trend so really gonna do that there and

288
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,070
then of course we have to make them

289
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:42,260
eyebrow twins they can't be sister so I

290
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:43,730
checked it exactly even well I think

291
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:45,350
that's the best they've ever looked

292
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:46,400
okay so pretty good right like we

293
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,810
definitely a little bit of concealer

294
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:51,010
just to clean them up a little bit

295
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:55,529
really just got a sister snatch them

296
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:57,699
oh yes for all you yes that is exactly

297
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:58,720
what we're going for tonight that it's

298
00:09:57,699 --> 00:10:00,639
so good

299
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,380
well this eyebrow is just a skinny

300
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:04,360
legend oh my god

301
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:06,220
Mariah whoo this is how close I am to

302
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:08,320
losing my mind wow I think this is

303
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:09,459
finally it since starting my Instagram

304
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,079
account three years ago I've just gotten

305
00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:12,850
so many comments about my eyebrows being

306
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:14,949
too thick or not arched enough or just

307
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:16,449
too big and I've had so many brands not

308
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:17,860
repost me because of it and maybe

309
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,510

331
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:11,510
this one comes from Andrew and he says

332
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:12,440
girl why was your wing so sore

333
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:16,520
you really should have made a sharp

334
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:17,750
enough to cut it right so definitely to

335
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:20,570
listen to Andrew we need to make our

336
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:22,310
line or really a really long and then

337
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:25,520
according to it divine we need to make

338
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:27,470
it really thick so let's bring this just

339
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:29,330
up Andres really you know we love a

340
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:30,920
thick sister you know who cares about

341
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:32,780
the hours of time we spend on blending

342
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,340
our eyeshadow like wing liner is really

343
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:36,920
aware it's it just really opens up the

344
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:39,410
eye just frames the face so well I

345
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:42,140
definitely would say winged liner make

346
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:43,910
it nice and thick every day Wow I think

347
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:45,290
they were so right my wings are big

348
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:47,450
enough and sharp enough to almost fly

349
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:48,530
away I love that alright so the eye look

350
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:50,300
is almost complete and I'm literally

351
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:51,530
loving it so far and her necks it was

352
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,970
going to be a lash it said I'm actually

353
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:54,320
really really excited for this one

354
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:56,030
because similar to brows I've always

355
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,140
charcoal just a little bit with lashes

356
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:58,640
when I first started to do makeup I

357
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:59,930
would always go to my eye shot and even

358
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,190
still to this day I have very very

359
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:02,510
sensitive eye so sometimes eyelashes

360
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:03,890
will come off or they won't sit right

361
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,790
and there's a little bit wonky so I'm

362
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,080
really looking forward to reading your

363
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:07,700
guys's advice today and hopefully being

364
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,740
able to fix them this coming home from

365
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,970
Samuel and he says no sister the lashes

366
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:12,260
you chose for this look we're all wrong

367
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:13,520
they close off your eyes making them

368
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:15,170
appear smaller you should have used a

369
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,790
way bigger lash that flares outwards and

370
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:17,870
really lift the eye up rather than

371
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:19,130
squashing it down

372
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,570
okay so Samuel thinks we need to use a

373
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:22,190
big lash today which I'm totally down

374
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:23,330
for I mean I love my Mami's but

375
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:24,920
sometimes you just gotta be a little bit

376
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:26,480
extra you know so I grab these three Oh

377
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,720
ones I think they're really gonna do the

378
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,130
job

379
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,170
okay so just put on some glue and now

380
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:31,280
sam said when we put them on we need to

381
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:33,050
make sure that the washes really go

382
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:35,150
upwards so they don't close down the eye

383
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:37,460
so I'm gonna put this right here in the

384
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:41,340
inner corner perfect and then it's gonna

385
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:44,850
pull this tail and right up here oh yeah

386
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:46,920
only really lift it everything straight

387
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:48,480
up Wow okay so those are looking up

388
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:52,370
great but I think they could be a little

389
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,370
bit more lifted so you know what

390
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:03,050
really get them up there let them up gal

391
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:09,930
hmm this looks amazing

392
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,220
RFA so this look is almost complete and

393
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:12,900
our next item is going to be the lipid e

394
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,220
doodahs you know starting from day one

395
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,720
I've learned so many techniques about

396
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:17,160
over lining and making them look

397
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,540
beautiful of course I've gotten lip

398
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,620
filler but you know what there's always

399
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,300
ways that I can really improve my

400
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:24,029
technique so this comment comes from

401
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:25,680
Jessica and she says sister love you but

402
00:13:24,029 --> 00:13:27,390
your over line your lips way too much

403
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,310
they look like they're about to explode

404
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,360
you know what fair no date sometimes I

405
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:32,160
definitely come in at that I go a little

406
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:38,520
bit overboard so let's just bring them

407
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:41,790
back to their normal size whoa oh my god

408
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:43,260
Jessica girl you are literally so bright

409
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:44,580
I am actually gonna call my doctor right

410
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:46,529
now and ask her to dissolve the lip

411
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:48,450
filler because this just looks the best

412
00:13:46,529 --> 00:13:50,279
hashtag natural beauty is the best

413
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:52,110
beauty this next one I actually get all

414
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:53,520
the time it is always a top comment on

415
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:56,190
my video and you know what I hear you

416
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:58,170
guys Takaya says sis then lips dry

417
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:59,790
though Hannah says how you gonna be a

418
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,770
guru and have your lips looking dry as

419
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:04,470
how sunshine says I feel like his lips

420
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:06,089
are always so dry the indie said Wow

421
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:11,250
James's lips are about as dry as his sex

422
00:14:06,089 --> 00:14:12,660
life you got me there

423
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,280
you know what you guys are totally right

424
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:16,589
nobody likes a crusty lip it is

425
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:20,040
definitely soso service and not the way

426
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:22,350
to go let's accept eventually Wow

427
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,400
oh my god so much better alright you

428
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:25,170
guys oh my god I think we're actually

429
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,670
done with this look today and looking in

430
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:28,800
the mirror this is by far the best I've

431
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:30,120
heard looked oh my god I am so glad that

432
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,200
I set my ego aside and just really

433
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,310
listened to everybody who knew exactly

434
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,350
what they were talking about because

435
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:35,670
clearly this is the result and our last

436
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:36,750
but final step was going to be Sat

437
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:38,430
anything in place so we can really just

438
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,990
keep this on all day long and thank God

439
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:41,550
we have one last comment to really guide

440
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:42,570
us through the setting spray and that is

441
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:44,610
from Tegea

442
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:46,110
and she says that wasn't his friends it

443
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:49,800
was the full-on shower you need to use

444
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:51,270
way less setting spray oh okay maybe

445
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,410
maybe if I use less it'll really lock it

446
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:58,440
in all day long

447
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:59,670
let's try that's it all right you guys

448
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,490
that is all I have for this video today

449
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:03,690
this is Venice so much fun to film this

450
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:05,250
look I mean can we talk about it

451
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:06,510
literally iconic 1 million likes on

452
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,770
Instagram here we come

453
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:09,510
on a more serious note obviously this

454
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:10,089
video was satire and I was just joking

455
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,860
around in a play

456
00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:13,029
and light-hearted manner but if I said

457
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:14,709
that hate comments never affected me I

458
00:15:13,029 --> 00:15:16,449
would 100% be lying because of him being

459
00:15:14,709 --> 00:15:17,800
honest they do obviously I try my

460
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:19,120
absolute best to put on a good front for

461
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,009
you guys and always inspire people and

462
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,779
preach positivity but I'm a normal human

463
00:15:21,009 --> 00:15:24,639
being just like you are I have feelings

464
00:15:22,779 --> 00:15:26,199
and sometimes comments really do hurt

465
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,149
before you write something please think

466
00:15:26,199 --> 00:15:29,800
is this necessary to say is this helpful

467
00:15:28,149 --> 00:15:30,970
is this constructive because like my

468
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,490
momma said if you don't have anything

469
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:34,930
nice to say don't say anything at all on

470
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:37,209
the contrary at the end of the day

471
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:38,259
nobody's perfect especially not me I'm

472
00:15:37,209 --> 00:15:39,670

473
00:15:38,259 --> 00:15:40,870
