I'm building at this point is unleash

29
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,050
your inner artist and I firmly did both

30
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,489
the palette and picked all the brushes

31
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,899
for the brush set to be for my working

32
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:03,149
artists out there to literally be able

33
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:04,530
to create any look possible and one of

34
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:06,150
my missions in the beauty community I

35
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,430
obviously kind of skyrocketed very very

36
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,750
quickly but I always love to shout out

37
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,280
smaller artists and to get inspiration

38
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,570
from them because I feel like small

39
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,250
artists the ones to keep this industry

40
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,750
going and I know from me they've been a

41
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,280
major source of inspiration for my more

42
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,689
creative looks if you've been following

43
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,100
on Instagram which if you're not you

44
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:21,360
need to go follow right now I'm doing

45
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,920
the sisterhood we were almost 10 million

46
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,350
sisters showing on Instagram as well

47
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,970
it's pretty good and fresh handle it you

48
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,560
would know that on Sundays sometimes I

49
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,869
do it sister takeovers where I basically

50
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,790
have a smaller artist come on and take

51
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:35,100
over my Instagram story for the day and

52
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:37,079
give a live tutorial and create a really

53
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,720
bomb and beautiful makeup look and I've

54
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:41,340
truly found so many amazing accounts

55
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,079
that I love getting inspiration from and

56
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,189
not to toot my own horn as well but

57
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:46,530
we've definitely been able to help my

58
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:48,329
few small artists gain upwards of 50,000

59
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,369
followers and only one day which has

60
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:51,930
been it so incredibly amazing here in

61
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:54,240
the makeup community it has been a known

62
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:56,820
fact that reviews aren't always exactly

63
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,810
the most genuine now I'm very confident

64
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,850
that you guys are going to love the

65
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:01,130
palette but in honor of my sister's

66
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:03,469
Sunday takeovers

67
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:04,700
on this launching and in honor of the

68
00:02:03,469 --> 00:02:07,159
fact that I have not slept in about

69
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:09,380
three months now I hand chose four

70
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:11,209
artists that I love that I look up to

71
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:12,680
that have inspired me that I think have

72
00:02:11,209 --> 00:02:14,269
really really amazing messages here in

73
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,340
the make up community and I asked them

74
00:02:14,269 --> 00:02:18,230
to come here to California to film in

75
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:20,090

begin the blending process okay so I'm

108
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,670

109
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:24,560
right into the beginning of my crease

110
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:27,019
keeping it a lot closer to the nose

111
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,330

00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:48,319

120
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:52,250

142
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,560

144
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,980

148
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:51,560
of begin you know doing makeup and then

149
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:53,630
from brows came lips came Foundation and

150
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,700

151
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:57,770

153
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,540
life

154
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:02,090
alright so now I'm gonna go ahead and

155
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:04,670
pick up an M 506 brush James has got us

156
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:05,360
covered in all departments this brush is

157
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,950
perfect for us

158
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,870
Asian girls who have tiny eyes or

159
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:10,640
anybody got tiny eyes I kind of suffer

160
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:12,110
put a little bit of a hood so there's

161
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,060
gonna be perfect for tucking that shadow

162
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:16,820
deep into your socket and making it look

163
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:18,470
sickening and sketch so taking the M 506

164
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:20,540
I'm gonna dip into the shade I love that

165
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:22,370
and I'm gonna deepen up the pink blue

166
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:23,900
and the green and we're gonna just carry

167
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:26,060
it along and create a nice little window

168
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:30,170
shape so go ahead and tuck this shade

169
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:32,390
love that right above your mobile lid so

170
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:34,490
you can create some power and intensity

171
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:41,030
so that when you cut your crease

172
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:41,870
it's nice and vibrant oh honey so I'm

173
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:43,940
gonna go ahead and repeat the same

174
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:45,830
process I'm gonna dip into the shade of

175
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:47,780
Cola I'm gonna deepen up the dilution in

176
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:49,250
the center so when I tell you that the

177
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:51,260
kids are not ready for this pigment

178
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:53,330
we're gonna dip into the darkest green

179
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:54,620
color which is called daddy we're gonna

180
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:56,300
dip into the shade daddy and we're gonna

181
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,780
go ahead and open up the green on the

182
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,310
edges

183
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:00,470
all right girls I'm gonna go ahead and

184
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:01,970
cut my crease now and hopefully that I'm

185
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:04,130
still this shade of tan when I come back

186
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:05,870
because holding your breath girl now go

187
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,280
ahead and do it off camera I'm gonna go

188
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:09,560
ahead and have some liner and it'll be

189
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,660
right back to finish up the lower lash

190
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:14,420
all right sister so I went ahead and cut

191
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:16,400
my crease with the M 124 and now I'm

192
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:18,770
placing the shade pinky be drinking tea

193
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,290
on my lid and the cut so I can go ahead

194
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:22,610
and set it and prep my provider and all

195
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:24,200
the others dish that we're about to add

196
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:25,610
so much super cool about this collection

197
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,650
of brushes that James is releasing with

198
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:29,840
this palette is that he includes doubles

199
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:31,100
of each brush so say I just cut my

200
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,110
crease with this brush right here which

201
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,340
is the M 124 I would want to go in and

202
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:36,020
set with the same one because it's the

203
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:37,370
tiniest perfect little eyeshadow brush

204
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,420
so I'm picking up the shaping can you

205
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:40,280
drinking it when I go ahead and do that

206
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:41,540
so say if it only had one in here I

207
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,220
would have to go back in and clean my

208
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:44,660
brush just to do the same thing over

209
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,820
again so it's really cool and I really

210
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:47,230
appreciate that coming from

211
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:49,780
our distant point that there is another

212
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:51,280
Russian here of the exact same one so

213
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:52,630
that you can go ahead and use it in the

214
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,800
same look we're gonna make a little

215
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:57,070
switch to the brush and I'm gonna pick

216
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,690
up this morphe m or eight brush a little

217
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:01,510
bit more dense so we can pack on more

218
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:03,490
color boom we're back you guys so I went

219
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:05,110
ahead and winged my liner off-camera as

220
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:06,670
well as look like some flashes and a bit

221
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:08,560
of bling and now we're gonna go ahead

222
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:10,630
and move on to a smokey on our under

223
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,870
eyes in order to do so I'm going to take

224
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:15,520
my favorite little more feet at 5:06 so

225
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:17,970
I'm gonna dip into the color playground

226
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,350
I'm gonna go ahead and smoke that out

227
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:22,150
lightly to just kind of determine this

228
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:23,800
shape kind of just sketch out where I

229
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:25,510
want the color to be it was really easy

230
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,000
for me especially to blow it out a

231
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:29,860
little too far so with this brush

232
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,540
precision is really easy which I really

233
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:33,790
like like I said I have really small

234
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:35,140
eyes so this is perfect for getting them

235
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:37,570
right under there and making it look

236
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:39,070
super nice and so the color looks good

237
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:40,540
I'm pretty happy with it it's just a

238
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:42,250
light wash of color I'm just to

239
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:44,050
determine where I want to really make it

240
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,820
intense so I'm gonna go ahead and pick

241
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:47,590
up this brush right here which is the m2

242
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:49,540
10 and I'm gonna pack on a lot of color

243
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:51,060
to make it really intense and pop hey

244
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:54,430
guys I wanted to talk a little bit about

245
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:56,920
my experiences as an influencer I mean

246
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:59,710
I'm pretty new in the game but I have

247
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,550
had so many crazy opportunities just

248
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:02,620
like this one that I'm doing right now

249
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:04,990
actually this video is gonna be featured

250
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:06,820
on James's channel it's really really

251
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:09,250
really inspired for me because I'm Asian

252
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:12,040
American and there isn't really very

253
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:14,110
much representation for us Asians in the

254
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,640
community and I'm actually from Laos but

255
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:18,160
there isn't really much representation

256
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:20,560
for Laos or asian-americans really at

257
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,850
all I think it's really cool that James

258
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,230
is giving me this opportunity and

259
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:25,540
morpheus giving me this opportunity to

260
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:27,130
kind of showcase my hardest street and

261
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:28,540
really like I don't know take it to the

262
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:30,280
next level I never would have thought in

263
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:32,260
a million years that like I would be

264
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:35,380
here today like filming a video with

265
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:37,000
Games's palette and you know even James

266
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:38,860
having a palette I mean he's paved the

267
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,169
way for the boys and makeup and it's

268
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,750
really cool and honestly like I can't

269
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:43,159
say it enough

270
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:45,050
inspiring it yeah I'm really really

271
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:47,089
grateful and I'm really happy to be here

272
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:48,860
so I just wanted to tell you guys I

273
00:08:47,089 --> 00:08:50,540
didn't give James a thank you all right

274
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:53,060
so I'm not gonna go ahead and take my

275
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:55,220
morphe e36 it's a tiny little pencil

276
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:57,740

278
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:04,129
gonna go ahead and intensify and then

and so now what I'm gonna do is I'm

283
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:16,310
gonna add a little bit of bling on my

284
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,449

guys it's Jake

339
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,720
that's raging on Instagram and I just

340
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:28,730
recreated the look I use for James's

341
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,160
campaign shoot so if you want to see how

342
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:33,649
I did this keep on watching so I'm gonna

343
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:36,889
be priming using the Mac soft ochre

344
00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:39,889
Paint Pot using an M 2 to 4 brush just

345
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:42,319
to prime my eyes so how I met James was

346
00:11:39,889 --> 00:11:44,839
a lot of people don't know this unless

347
00:11:42,319 --> 00:11:47,690
you do but I was his first-ever fan page

348
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:50,149
so that's like where we met pretty much

349
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:52,069
and then he just inspired me to make my

350
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:53,930
own makeup page and I never really

351
00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:54,350
thought that I would like be where it is

352
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:57,019
today

353
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:59,269
he helped me grow faster he this is

354
00:11:57,019 --> 00:12:00,949
hoping a lot of ways giving me a lot of

355
00:11:59,269 --> 00:12:03,170
like opportunities I never thought I

356
00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:03,350
would get and I just wanna thank him for

357
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:05,480
that

358
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:06,709
James has inspired me to do a lot of how

359
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,839
the ordinary looks

360
00:12:06,709 --> 00:12:10,760
that's probably why I've grown a little

361
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:12,980
faster it's because the looks I've done

362
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:14,480
aren't like a lot of like everyday looks

363
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:16,399
it's always something that is

364
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,350
eye-catching I think it was something

365
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,449
different that no one has seen so I'm

366
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:23,450
gonna be studying the Mac over Paint Pot

367
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:28,470
with a powder just so

368
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:30,960
and so I don't get any but yeah I was

369
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:33,750
saying I was James's first fan page

370
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:37,020
which is kind of embarrassing now but

371
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:39,180
honestly to me not really because it got

372
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:42,660
me where I am today I'll always support

373
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:44,970
them still and it's just amazing how you

374
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:46,980
can go from being something so little to

375
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:48,960
something so big like I'm from a small

376
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:51,330
town and I never thought I'd be working

377
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:53,490
with something so big and being friends

378
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:55,740
with someone and such a big spotlight

379
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:57,840
and it's just amazing that that can

380
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:59,520
happen I'm gonna be using a morphia amp

381
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:01,650
or for one so I'm gonna be dipping into

382
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,480
the sky blue sheet and I'm just gonna op

383
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:06,240
that like I'm right in the crease and

384
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,380
then just start to blend that out to

385
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,020
deepen that out I'm going to be using

386
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:11,520
the morphe M or three three and I'm

387
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:14,610
gonna be dipping into the slightly

388
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:16,680
darker blue just to add some depth in

389
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:20,600
the crease I'm gonna go back in with

390
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:23,310
that morphe m4 4-1 and blend out that

391
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:25,200
deeper color to deepen that even more

392
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:27,510
I'm going with the darker blue and I'm

393
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,570
just gonna do I'm gonna be cutting the

394
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:33,540
crease using the Mac soft ochre Paint

395
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:35,250
Pot again and a morphe two to four I'm

396
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:41,850
gonna be applying this light blue

397
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:43,590
shimmery shade onto the Aoi all over

398
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:45,870
there I'm gonna go back in with the

399
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:48,390
first shade we used which was that

400
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:52,140
lighter blue that like sky-blue now I'm

401
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:54,520
just gonna put it right in here to start

402
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:57,640
to blend that a line

403
00:13:54,520 --> 00:14:01,450
go ahead and just use the access shadow

404
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:03,970
from that first shade we use just and I

405
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:06,010
just for a little bit of debt I'm gonna

406
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:08,410
go in with a little bit of block using

407
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:11,110
the morphe and four five six now to

408
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:14,560
start off the bottom lower lash line I'm

409
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:16,930
gonna use pretty much the same steps we

410
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,520
used for the top going from the lightest

411
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:21,990
blue to the darkest blue I'm gonna grab

412
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:27,040
that transition shade again that blue

413
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:30,040
and I'm gonna grab more and four three

414
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,010
three going with the next shade which is

415
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:35,050
a little darker than the fair shade a

416
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:36,700
little closer to the lash line and then

417
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:39,910
going in with the darker blue shade

418
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:43,420
we're gonna mix it with the black and

419
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:45,910
then plane right on the lower lash line

420
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:47,589
just having it right in there to finish

421
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:49,930
this I like I'm gonna grab me the morphe

422
00:14:47,589 --> 00:14:51,760
color pencil and shake coconut and I'm

423
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:53,890
just going to pop that in the waterline

424
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,149
so that is what I all complete and now

425
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:56,380
I'm gonna go finish the other one off

426
00:14:55,149 --> 00:14:58,690
camera and then we're gonna come back

427
00:14:56,380 --> 00:15:00,459
and do the neck piece we're back that's

428
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:03,459
full theis complete I just thrown some

429
00:15:00,459 --> 00:15:05,410
lashes to complete guys but now we're

430
00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:07,390
gonna highlight the inner corner and it

431
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:08,770
just completes the look honestly so now

432
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:10,420
we're gonna do my out so I can start on

433
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:12,790
the neck piece for the neck piece you're

434
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:14,709
gonna need some bigger brushes and some

435
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:17,620
smaller brushes just so we can lay down

436
00:15:14,709 --> 00:15:19,720
the first shade and then using the

437
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:21,490
smaller brushes to add more depth and

438
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,440
dimension when adding the clouds I'm

439
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:25,209
just gonna dip into pretty much the same

440
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,750
thing as we did on the eyes just like

441
00:15:25,209 --> 00:15:30,940
adding the color onto the neck and just

442
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:33,339
laying it on there oh and I'm using the

443
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:35,770
morphe and 405 so once we have that

444
00:15:33,339 --> 00:15:37,270
first color on I'm gonna dip into this

445
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:38,740
lighter darker blue and just like

446
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:41,410
throwing it on

447
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:44,589
anywhere right now you just want some

448
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:47,020
darker spots and then we're gonna add

449
00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:51,010
more darker spots and right after we're

450
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:53,470
gonna apply the white - oh and the brush

451
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:55,750
I'm using to apply this color is the e43

452
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:58,089
to further deepen out those areas I'm

453
00:15:55,750 --> 00:16:00,279
gonna take a morphe and by 10 and then

454
00:15:58,089 --> 00:16:02,320
I'm gonna dip into it through blue just

455
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:03,910
a little bit of the black going back and

456
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,260
forth between those colors I'm just

457
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:08,529
gonna be using a little bit more of that

458
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:11,830
sky blue shadow and just popping it

459
00:16:08,529 --> 00:16:13,209
right where we had it the middle so now

460
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:15,399
I'm just gonna be adding that pigna I

461
00:16:13,209 --> 00:16:18,550
used on the inner corner all over the

462
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:20,980
neck just so it gives some really pretty

463
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:25,990
effect I'm going to be taking the morphe

464
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:27,430
m5 town dipping into that people so now

465
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:28,600
we're going to be adding the clouds on

466
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:31,240
the neck and I'm just gonna be dipping

467
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:36,520
into this white shade in the Jamestown

468
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:38,110
and will be packing on in a cloud shade

469
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:40,480
this white is probably the most

470
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:43,029
pigmented why I've ever used it's so

471
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,620
good and so pigmented and just to

472
00:16:43,029 --> 00:16:46,779
brighten out my highlight I'm gonna be

473
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:54,220
taking a highlighter from morphe this is

474
00:16:46,779 --> 00:16:56,410
an extra and I'm gonna so this is

475
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:59,160
complete I'm just gonna set my face with

476
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:59,160
some preference

477
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:17,380
[Music]

478
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:19,900
we're done and this looks amazing thanks

479
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:22,660
to the James pallet this took a while

480
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:26,920
but it's done it looks good the pigment

481
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:29,980
is so good so blues for me are very hard

482
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:33,280
to blend just in my opinion and this

483
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:35,020
blended like a dream like look at that I

484
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,590
don't know if you can see that but I can

485
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:39,550
see that

486
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:41,760
and it's so blended and the shadows just

487
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:43,000
performed so good the white was

488
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,540
phenomenal

489
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:49,780

and create this on kind of nervous and

528
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,970
I'm kind of like I don't know what to do

529
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:22,750
but today I think I'm gonna use some red

530
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:24,820
on my eyelid and just you know wing it

531
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:26,080
and try to figure it out as I go but I

532
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:27,880
know I'm gonna use red and then I'm

533
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,040
gonna tell you guys about my story if

started so today I'm gonna be priming my

537
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:39,670
eyelids actually because I heard that

538
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:41,950
the eyeshadows actually worked really

539
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:45,010
well with the eyelid primer usually I

540
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:46,360
use concealer like James so this is kind

541
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:48,670
of different for me but you know hey

542
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:52,300
let's give it a shine they're trying you

543
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:54,910
know I'm using the m22 for morphe brush

544
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:56,680
to like you know basically just a base

545
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:58,300
on my eyelid you always use a lighter

546
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,860
color so that a shadow can just show up

547
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:02,320
more cuz it also is a little bit harder

548
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:04,660
for darker skin tones to like shadows to

549
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,550
show up but we're about to see how this

550
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:09,910
works I always use the lighter so look

551
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:12,430
it just like the vibrant as it can so I

552
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:14,230
have my eyelid primed and now I'm just

553
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:16,600
gonna go straight into this color this

554
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:20,380
palette is actually so cool because it's

555
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:23,470
so like big I don't know if this is like

556
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:24,850
huge like look like bigger than my face

557
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:26,830
so I'm gonna go straight into the red

558
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:29,320
with you're kidding with another morphe

559
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:32,170
brush from James's collection to M 4-3-3

560
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:33,370
brush and I'm just gonna start putting

561
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:34,960
this on my eyelid

562
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:40,810
hopefully the best but this is like a

563
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:42,010
true red and I chose the color red it's

564
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:44,770
kind of hard for me like to talk you

565
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:47,140
know Lynn but I chose the color red on

566
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:50,980
my just for this look is because I'm

567
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:52,720
actually HIV positive so when I I just

568
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:53,800
felt like you know just was spitting to

569
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,150
that because you know with like red

570
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,130
products and all that kind of stuff and

571
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:58,830
just like you know HIV so I just wanted

572
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:01,230
to do is red and then I wanted to do

573
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:03,450
the Ellis casino to tie into this I have

574
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:05,280
my whole story on actually on YouTube

575
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:08,070
that's my story about like this why I

576
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:10,410
chose red and the reason I got into

577
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:12,840
makeup was because makeup was kind of

578
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:14,520
like my calm or like the storm that was

579
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,560
going around me and like there was just

580
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:18,990
so much just like going on in my life so

581
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:20,850
at the time I just like picked up makeup

582
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:23,310
and just like started going in with it

583
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:25,940
and having fun with it you can just give

584
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:29,940
me something to do and like just really

585
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:31,920
grounded me and it just turned into me

586
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:34,110
just a wee makeup all the time and now I

587
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,640
do like Instagram videos and all that

588
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:37,320
kind of stuff and then just nightmare

589
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,850
which is kind of amazing

590
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,680
and I'm just gonna bring this out a

591
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:42,120
little bit dramatic because the name of

592
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,590
this palette is unleash your inner

593
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,480
artist and I couldn't want to just do

594
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:47,910
something dramatic and kind of you know

595
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:50,010
not to be so simple playing game today

596
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:52,140
so I'm gonna kind of drag it out so if

597
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:54,270
it looks crazy right now just trust the

598
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:56,700
process and it will come all together

599
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:58,920
I'm gonna take I believe it's called

600
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:01,410
Mary I'm gonna blend that into the top

601
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:03,570
so Kim like you see I'll just like blend

602
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:06,420
in with that eye and to give it a little

603
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:09,420
bit more of like depth I'm going to use

604
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:12,090
deke I'm going to just kind of like go

605
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:13,950
like right here on my it's like my

606
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:15,840
eyelid bone and just kind of like give

607
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:17,040
it some dimension in our depth there's

608
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,110
something like this so it's gonna be a

609
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:22,140
little bit darker okay so now that we

610
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:25,110
have the base kind of finished I think

611
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:27,780
I'm going to take now like a shimmer red

612
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:29,970
so I'm gonna do this shade shook and I

613
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:32,490
think I'm gonna use my finger and pack

614
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:34,050
that right on to the lid as I feel like

615
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:35,520
that look really pretty

616
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:37,770
alright so I'm gonna go to the shade

617
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,350
acapella I'm just gonna it's much of

618
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:44,140
blue and

619
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:46,480
4:31 brush blending and dragging it all

620
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:49,210
off and it's kind of like turning into a

621
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:51,820
purple but I like how dramatic this blue

622
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:53,380
is like right under the eye now I'm

623
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:55,570
gonna put something a little bit lighter

624
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:57,850
in the inner corner just to bring a

625
00:22:55,570 --> 00:23:00,280
little bit more light to the eye and not

626
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:02,200
look so dark and you know just bring a

627
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:05,110
little life to you there's a lot of like

651
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:19,330
to me

652
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:21,070
I moved to LA at 20 and I just had a

653
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:24,310
dream to like start but YouTube career

654
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:28,750
and I got here and I got diagnosed with

655
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:29,170
HIV and when in September of last year I

656
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:31,180
think

657
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:33,040
yeah September of last year everything

658
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:35,500
just stopped like everything really just

659
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:40,260
stopped in my life like I lost my car I

660
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:43,000
was also homeless for a while and

661
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:45,280
everything felt like it was like against

662
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,510
me and I felt like there was no winning

663
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:48,910
fortunately you can stay with some

664
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:51,160

697
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:01,760
we're gonna add the tape the outer

698
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:03,919
portion of the eye like this and then

699
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,720
leave like a little gap right there so

700
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,160
that you can go back and add your

701
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:09,590
shadows right here and then we're gonna

702
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:11,120
zoom in closer on the eyes so that you

703
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:12,950

704
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,450

00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,630
very deep purple and I'm gonna pick up a

712
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:35,780
little bit and then tap the excess off

713
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:38,720

719
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:53,120
go in with another brush this is a am 41

720
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:55,400
brush it's just a flip of your brush and

721
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:58,040
I just like to take this and I like to

722
00:26:55,400 --> 00:27:00,650
blend the purple up now with the same

723
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:02,480
morphe and a four or five six brush I'm

724
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:04,380
gonna take a playground which is a

725
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,390
lighter blue and I'm gonna add it

726
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:08,460
right here so I'm creating like a

727
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:09,960
rainbow but I'm doing it backwards and

728
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:12,360
don't worry if it doesn't look blended

729
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:15,450
yet I just like to focus the shadow

730
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:17,370
right here first and then we go back and

731
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:19,440
blend everything out words you can

732
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:22,080
already see I only did my brush in one

733
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,850
time and it was already so so pigmented

734
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:26,490
now I'm gonna go back in the width and

735
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:29,850
for for one brush and just blend the

736
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:33,300
blue up with no additional product so

737
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:36,420
why I like color a lot I was always

738
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:39,690
really sad so when I started doing

739
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:42,330
makeup color really helped me become

740
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:45,690
more happy and when I do a colorful look

741
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:49,230
I just I'm just so happy i am taking the

742
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:51,840
morphe m45 six brush and i'm using

743
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:53,400
social blade and i'm putting this right

744
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:56,010
here next to the blue and then i'm

745
00:27:53,400 --> 00:28:00,110
blending it upwards towards my brow now

746
00:27:56,010 --> 00:28:03,360
what's really cool about the James and

747
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:05,550
morphe brush collection is that you're

748
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:08,100
not getting only one of each brush

749
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:10,290
you're getting multiples so in the first

750
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:14,130
collection you are getting I believe

751
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:16,760
it's three of the m45 six brushes and as

752
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:20,340
someone who does rainbow looks who does

753
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:23,250
multiple colors on one eye I need

754
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:25,890
multiple brushes so this collection

755
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:28,350
really does come in handy for an artist

756
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:31,650
like myself so again I'm taking the

757
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:33,060
morphe and four-five-six brush this is a

758
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:34,440
really good brush as you guys can tell

759
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:37,050
I've been using it throughout the whole

760
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:39,180
entire video and I'm gonna dip into the

761
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:42,300
yellow it's called B as you guys can

762
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:44,730
tell I also struggle with acne and just

763
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:46,140
being open and vulnerable about that I

764
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:49,950
get a lot of people that tell me that

765
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:53,130
that has helped them for James to ask me

766
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:55,500
to do this on his like platform makes me

767
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:57,330
happy because it's a message that's very

768
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,520
important to be inclusive to all skin

769
00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:03,150
types and all skin tones so I'm very

770
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:05,190
happy and acne is normal and skin

771
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:07,260
positivity is something that we should

772
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:09,720
always push through I know I'm not the

773
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:11,420
only one that struggles with acne and if

774
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,820
you are someone that struggles with acne

775
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:16,880
no you're not you're beautiful and I

776
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:18,860
hope that in some sort of way I hope you

777
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:21,470
so I'm just gonna go back in a little

778
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:24,110
bit with socialblade in between you want

779
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:26,270
to go back in with the colors just so

780
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:28,040
they can blend together I don't feel

781
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:29,990
like I necessarily have to do that just

782
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:31,520
because they're blending if you guys can

783
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:33,530
see they're blending all together very

784
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:37,970
perfectly so I don't even really have to

785
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:39,770
go back and blend good so I'm gonna go

786
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:43,130
into some oranges and I'm going to mix

787
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:45,980
two I'm gonna make spy 1/8 and arrest it

788
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:47,840
rusted is more of like a deeper orange

789
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:50,180
but I want to mix them because I just

790
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:51,620
want them to create like a darker orange

791
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:54,950
if that makes sense now I'm using the

792
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:56,960
same morphe m45 six brush and this color

793
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:59,240
I'm gonna put it on that outer portion

794
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,370
of my eye just a little bit so I'm going

795
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:02,870
to go ahead and anchor my crease I'm

796
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:04,790
gonna give myself like I have cookies

797
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:07,250
you guys can use whatever concealer you

798
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:09,410
want I'm just gonna take my own and do

799
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:11,120
that so I just cut my crease and I

800
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:13,900
stopped right here and I'm going to add

801
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:16,700
the red I'm going to take this morphe

802
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:19,490
m56 tooth brush and I'm gonna dip in

803
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:21,620
just a little bit and I'm going to pack

804
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:24,230
it on right here in the outer portion of

805
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:26,840
the eye and the artistry palette I was

806
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:30,710
really happy that he included a white

807
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:33,080
and a black because I use a lot of white

808
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:34,820
shadow I like using white in my inner

809
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:37,190
corner I feel like it makes everything

810
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:39,440
pop but today I'm going to use that not

811
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:43,640
only in my inner corner it fits on my

812
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:45,920
lid so I'm taking this M 224 flat brush

813
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:48,170
and so I loaded my brush and I'm gonna

814
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:49,550
Pat in this white right here so I'm

815
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:52,790
going to take a little bit of pink which

816
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:54,710
is called skip and this morphe e36 brush

817
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:56,210
it's very tiny and I'm going to add this

818
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:58,400
pink right here and that's just because

819
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:59,690
I wanted to use the pink in this palette

820
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,670
it's really really pretty and as you

821
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:04,220
guys can see it's super super pigmented

822
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:05,430
and I'm just gonna add it right here by

823
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:07,290
the red and then

824
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:09,060
blend it with the red just a little bit

825
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:11,040
I'm gonna go ahead and remove the tape

826
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:12,720
you should get like a really nice clean

827
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:15,570
cut like that so I'm gonna take the

828
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,550
morphe and 3-2-1 brush and I'm gonna

829
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:19,890
take skip which is the pink and I'm

830
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:22,110
gonna add it right here on the waterline

831
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:26,100
so I'm going to take you're kidding on

832
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:28,710
the morphe e36 brush and just blend this

833
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:31,440
down here just a little bit I don't want

834
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:33,720
a lot so one of my signature lips that's

835
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,460
my inner corner store and I buy these

836
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,830
and Michael's you can get them at any

837
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:39,140
arts and crafts stores but I get my own

838
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:42,030
scent Michael I'd like to take some

839
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:44,700
tweezers and I will pop it right in my

840
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:46,500
inner corner like this this is James

841
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:48,540
palliate has a white which makes me

842
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:51,540
really happy I'm gonna use that white

843
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:54,780
and put it in my inner corner so I like

844
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:56,670
to use like a really bulky brush when it

845
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:59,580
comes to like my inner corner star I am

846
00:31:56,670 --> 00:32:02,910
using the morphe 173 brush this is also

847
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:06,930
in James's brush collection so I like to

848
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:10,410
do this thing where I tap in and press

849
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:13,050
down on the inner corner store I like to

850
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:14,880
press down the shadow so I'm taking some

851
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:17,610
tweezers and then I like to remove it

852
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,440
you should get a stamp like that in your

853
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:21,390
inner corner so this is the completed

854
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,000
look I'm gonna go ahead and add some

855
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:27,710
mascara some lashes and then finish this

856
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,710
eye and I will be right back

857
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:42,460
[Music]

858
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:44,620
alright guys so this is the completed

859
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:47,740
look I did want to touch a little bit on

860
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:49,840
the palate and my thoughts on it so I

861
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:52,570
mean right away it's really pigmented I

862
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:55,090
work with color so I know what like I

863
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:57,310
know what I like and I know what I want

864
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:59,410
from a palette and this is definitely a

865
00:32:57,310 --> 00:33:01,630
palette that I would use over and over

866
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:04,210
again the purple was really good

867
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:06,310
Purple's are not my favorite and this

868
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:09,010
purple was actually really solid and it

869
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:11,260
blended really really well the blues and

870
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:13,480
the greens were really really nice

871
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:15,520
greens I always have like an issue it

872
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:17,500
just because I feel like sometimes some

873
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:19,780
greens from some brands are like too

874
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:23,020
dark this one gives me like almost like

875
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:25,000
a very green lime neon kind of feel so I

876
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:26,980
really like that and then yellows are

877
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,660
really really important you can tell if

878
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:30,880
the palette is good if it has like a

879
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:32,590
really great bright yellow so I really

880
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,270
like the yellow in this palette oranges

881
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:35,860
are always like formulated really really

882
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:38,380
nice so I really like the orange and

883
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:40,600
then the Reds and the Pink's they're

884
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:42,820
just so good they're so pigmented and

885
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:44,800
just overall I really like the palette

886
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:46,360
