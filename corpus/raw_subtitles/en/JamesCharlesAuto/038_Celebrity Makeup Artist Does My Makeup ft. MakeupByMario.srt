you're the past what we want to do to

66
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:11,010
that um I don't know

67
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:12,630
I fix out I'm so used to talking to a

68
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:14,070
crowd of people at the classes yeah

69
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:15,810
weird cuz I want to ask them but I can't

70
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:17,700
do you guys want glamour you guys what

71
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:19,290
natural I feel like we should do a glam

72
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,270
look especially using the palette just

73
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:22,830
because I don't have so many colorful

74
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:24,120
lugs iPhones like we go you can do

75
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:29,310
rainbow they want to see something

76
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:30,780
pretty alright like you're cool so when

77
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,160
I start doing makeup and especially it's

78
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,720
a new client which you basically are

79
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,910
right now because I've never done your

80
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,650
makeup I just started to start feeling

81
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:39,120
the features of the face and kind of

82
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,710
just envisioning the techniques I'm

83
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,200
gonna be doing that when hair has to go

84
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:45,300
high or lower so as I'm gonna start by

85
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,440
filling your eyebrows and while I'm

86
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,550
doing that I'm gonna start kind of

87
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,810
planning a look cause right now I have

88
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:50,490
no idea what I'm doing that's honestly

89
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:52,680
how I go into most of my makeup looks as

90
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:57,020
well it's the hardest part for people

91
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,020
whatever they do you have such a good

92
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:08,160
transformation they were disgusting are

93
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:09,600
you thinking I don't know and the thing

94
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,950
is - so everyone told me that they were

95
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,209
bad there was not a single person like

96
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:13,830
within the makeup community be like oh

97
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:15,750
yeah your eyebrows are good like

98
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:17,250
everyone's like AHA correct like even

99
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:19,080
though I saw see Leslie crazy no one

100
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:21,090
says when I first grew a moustache that

101
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,560
two years ago it was literally like so

102
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,959
long hitting my lips and when I look at

103
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,580
pictures I cringe oh how did no night my

104
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,330
family I told me like oh you need to

105
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,340
trim your mustache

106
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:32,520
cuz nobody wants to be mean but I wish

107
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:34,350
more people had bullied me about my

108
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:36,600
if I was close to you at that time I

109
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:38,000
would okay god I kind of go back to the

110
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,320
browser throughout the qualification

111
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,940
really the reason I do this because I'm

112
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,350
depends on how Elektra might be I make

113
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,850
up is like if I make up a super dramatic

114
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:46,590
and I don't want to go too heavy on the

115
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:50,790
girls so I could have just do like a

116
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:51,720
midway point with the browser okay so do

117
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,950
you want to tell the sisters a little

118
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,600
bit about like how long do you think

119
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:55,500
make up for like your education and

120
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,560
training and stuff just so they don't

121
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,690
like a little bit more about so I

122
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,320
started make up in 2000 so it's gonna be

123
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:07,680
19 years now

124
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:10,200
oh my god 1990 yeah Wow 14 1999 5 yeah

125
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,870
19 so he was like four months old when I

126
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:15,060
started doing makeup oh my god that is

127
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:16,560
insane that's so cool though like just

128
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,330
the level of success that you've reached

129
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,440
and the fact that you've been doing it

130
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:23,870
for home no only three years oh sorry

131
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,310
okay I hate talking about myself I

132
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:28,590
started doing makeup 19 years ago yeah

133
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:30,990
in New York and I got a job at Sephora

134
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:32,850
when I was 17 as a fragrance consultant

135
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:34,050
and I started doing makeup there it's

136
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:35,700
where I discovered makeup in the first

137
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:37,560
day of work and I got obsessed with it

138
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:39,840
fell in love with it started researching

139
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,610
it and at this time in the industry is

140
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,820
it's very different than it was than it

141
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:46,170
is now yep we want to talk about it was

142
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,850
like really really hard back then you

143
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:49,020
could not there was there was no social

144
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:51,150
media there was no way to get noticed

145
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:52,740
and so I started working retail and then

146
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,970
you know I really struggled I want to

147
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,470
say for the first like seven or eight

148
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:56,940
years and when I say struggle I mean

149
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:59,040
like barely being able to pay rent you

150
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:01,380
know like eating pizza and eating tuna

151
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,060
fish and like it was hard because you

152
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:04,440
you had to assist and a lot of those

153
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,270
systems all you had to do for free right

154
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,860
so you'd be on set for like 16 or 18

155
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:09,450
hours a day working with these masks and

156
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,070
makeup artists but you know you'd be

157
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:12,870
doing it for free for the experience hot

158
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:15,090
well that's how it was and then you know

159
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:16,560
I'd work for each on the side and then

160
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:18,680
when I eventually stopped retail I

161
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,120
started working like in television news

162
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,070
on the weekends just I can make you know

163
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,870
some steady income Brahe started doing

164
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:27,240
my own clients started working with

165
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:29,820
photographers and eventually like I want

166
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:32,460
to say after the six years so I started

167
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:34,800
doing like celebrities in New York some

168
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:36,060
pop singers and some actresses how did

169
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,370
that happen cuz I sleep that's a very

170
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,930
like intense to over like starting us

171
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:41,780
before I just testing and playing it out

172
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:44,960

174
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,740
intense job it just whoa no it wasn't it

175
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:51,050
wasn't like an attention shop it was

176
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:52,790
very like gradual gradual it was like

177
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:54,770
little by little just like step by step

178
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:56,660

179
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:58,100

181
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,220
agent at that time so I hadn't featured

since I was 21 but even within agent Lee

183
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:05,240
you know you still struggle at that time

184
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:07,340
yeah because to get noticed by a

185
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,200
celebrity there was just no way like

186
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:10,490
nowadays you could just write them on

187
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,410
them social media right Twitter or

188
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:14,590
Instagram which is helpful and they can

189
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:17,210
definitely discover you're nowadays -

190
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:18,380
back then there was just no way at all

191
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,850
you know the industry has definitely

192
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,530
changed you mention how the industry has

193
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:23,210
like changed a lot when it comes to like

194
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:24,830
artists and now like the emergence of

195
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:26,330
social media and there's no denying that

196
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:28,790
you were like one of the first to really

197
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:30,110
pioneer like makeup on social media you

198
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:32,480
have a huge following on Instagram

199
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:33,830
and like your work is major inspiration

200
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,390
to me and many other artists as well

201
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:36,650
would you say that social media has

202
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:38,180
changed to make impunity for the better

203
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:39,979
and in what ways do you think it's like

204
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,150
a factor that it's interesting for me to

205
00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:42,440
answer this question because I am

206
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,850
considered the old school like anyone

207
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,210
who's like 15 years in the business and

208
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:49,100
more is considered sort of all its glory

209
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:51,169
yeah and most of the people that are old

210
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,460
school they tend to not like social

211
00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:53,690
media and they think it's ruined and

212
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:55,460
they think it's ruined the industry and

213
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:57,610
they think that YouTube is ruined and

214
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:00,320
influencers everyone did there's a huge

215
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:01,640
that's a huge thing yeah it's a it's a

216
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,080
really big thing I feel like I'm gonna

217
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,700
also get it you know when this video

218
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,500
comes out because like people gonna turn

219
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,970
their nose up right you know why would

220
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,580
he do that with the influencer you know

221
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:12,440
but for me I mean I feel like Instagram

222
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:14,510
is amazing number one I feel like it's

223
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,310
changed in the street for the better for

224
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:18,229
me definitely and for many others as

225
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:20,210
well it provides it's provided so many

226
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:21,919
more opportunities that we never would

227
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:24,050
have had as makeup artists so many more

228
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,430
like types of jobs that we can do and

229
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:26,660
you know just the fact that you could

230
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:28,430
build a following you could you could

231
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,600
share your work and have control over it

232
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:31,280
you know Instagram is like a personal

233
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,289
magazine right and so you could share

234
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,330
your work and build a following build a

235
00:07:33,289 --> 00:07:37,850
business a legitimate business million

236
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:39,979
precise yeah and for me I've always been

237
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:42,410
sort of supportive of influencers in

238
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:44,840
youtubers for one because I know the

239
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:45,840
amount of work that goes into what you

240
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,610
guys do I think

241
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,350
people don't realize you know in the

242
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:50,820
older generation in particular and even

243
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:52,050
some of the newer generation they don't

244
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:54,030
realize the amount of work that goes

245
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:56,130
into doing a YouTube ad you're creating

246
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:57,660
content and you know it's like it's

247
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:59,729
really a full-time job and I think

248
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:02,550
someone like you in particular who I

249
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:04,530
really like admire when it comes to work

250
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:06,330
ethic you know I can see the amount of

251
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:07,470
work that you put into it you know the

252
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:09,510
fact that you're able to build a

253
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:10,970
following by the way I think you

254
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:14,280
probably get the award for the most

255
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:15,600
insane engagement like you've literally

256
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:18,600
grows like a billion dollars every three

257
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,280
days the same you know but that's like

258
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,810
to me like I don't look at that as like

259
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,520
uh you know I look at that as like holy

260
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:25,139
crap that's amazing like yeah it's

261
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,700
inspiring you know what I mean the work

262
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:28,139
is there you know to back it up because

263
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,460
you're working on stuff even on your

264
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:30,870
days off I feel like you're plotting and

265
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:32,729
planning and thinking of your next video

266
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:34,560
and yeah you know you're entertaining to

267
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:35,700
watch on social media and I think that's

268
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,300
really hard not everyone can do that

269
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,279
thank you

270
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:40,140
and so I have respect for you and for

271
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:41,580
all the other content creators out there

272
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:43,349
you know because it really is a hard job

273
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:45,390
and people don't realize like how much

274
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:46,650
goes into it and my other thing about it

275
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:48,510
is that because the industry has changed

276
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:49,980
right so there's all these kind of new

277
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,670
opportunities for these young artists

278
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,100
that are coming up

279
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:55,200
I've also look at that as just because I

280
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:57,300
had to struggle for like almost 10 years

281
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,370
in the beginning of my career and now

282
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,050
people don't like I feel like I I'm

283
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:02,550
happy for them because yeah they have

284
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:04,200
these cool opportunities now like if it

285
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:05,459
was my brother or my cousin or my son

286
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,740
you know and these opportunities came

287
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:09,180
their way and they're 18 and 19 I'm not

288
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,350
gonna tell them to sit in the room and

289
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,760
say no to everything I'm gonna say go

290
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:13,709
take the opportunities go get on

291
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,610
successful go with it you know and I

292
00:09:13,709 --> 00:09:16,200
feel like that's how people should think

293
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:18,029
about it as well I've only been in the

294
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,040
community for 3 years now but obviously

295
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:21,930
cover garlic was a major pivotal moment

296
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,920
and boys and beauty I feel like cause it

297
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:24,870
really bought it to like the mainstream

298
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:26,550
media and even over the past three years

299
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:28,560
I've seen such a positive change and so

300
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:29,910
many young boys trying out makeup and

301
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,709
imagine me being like oh no like you

302
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:33,360
can't like being mad that they were

303
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:35,070
getting a following or imagined that you

304
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,029
said no to covergirl right I hate

305
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,470
wouldn't makeup artists like oh

306
00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:39,540
influencers are taking our jobs like

307
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:40,910
when have you ever seen me on set like

308
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:44,060
doing makeup for a campaign

309
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:45,470
unless it's my own ever yeah but we it's

310
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,670
two totally different things than I

311
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:49,160
don't understand why there's so much

312
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:50,750
hatred between people living within the

313
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,460
same industry that are just performing

314
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:54,350
different tasks I mind my own business

315
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:56,570
I'm in my own studio making contests for

316
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:58,190
a younger demographic and working makeup

317
00:09:56,570 --> 00:10:00,170
artists are on set every single day

318
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:02,120
working just as hard doing celebrity

319
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:03,590
makeup and doing like shoot and client

320
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,150
talent campaign and sometimes like

321
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:06,890
sometimes our worlds collide you know

322
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:08,360
like a celebrity makeup artist like when

323
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:09,860
they do Oscars for Grammys you know they

324
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,030
work with the same brands that you guys

325
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,800
do because they're they're getting

326
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:14,930
sponsored by brands for their red carpet

327
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,340
looks so if sometimes the worlds collide

328
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:18,410
and I just feel like there needs to not

329
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:20,330
be a divide between the open generation

330
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,860
and the younger I feel like I just feel

331
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:23,570
like people needs to support support it

332
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:25,070
more not bash everyone can learn from

333
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:26,570
each other yeah look I feel like I've

334
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:27,770
learned so much from you and from other

335
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:29,090
industry professionals that I've looked

336
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:31,340
up to have been falling for a very very

337
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:32,900
long time like it's people like you

338
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,430
people like Anasazi there are people

339
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:36,200
that have like really been a great

340
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:38,240
mentor to me to give me advice and be

341
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:40,430
like hey listen I have been here for 19

342
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,510
plus years don't do that or like you

343
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:42,770
should do that so you should talk to

344
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:44,570
this person like I really value that

345
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:45,500
because as much as I love makeup and

346
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:46,850
marketing and stuff there's always

347
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,020
things that I can learn and improve on

348
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:49,700
and the same thing goes with the older

349
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:51,170
generation like just like you said

350
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,640
social media has been a huge emergence

351
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:54,290
in the community and I think it's really

352
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,760
changed it for the better but obviously

353
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:56,840
a lot of the older generation is that a

354
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,510
touch of that and I think that there's a

355
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:00,590
lot to be learned from them even for the

356
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:03,170
working making purpose how they can

357
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:05,600
build their brand further and still book

358
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:07,280
those jobs and not how to be taken by

359
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,920
influencers you have two options you

360
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:11,150
either you get with it and you you kind

361
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,320
of go with the change and you pay

362
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:14,120
attention to your social media and you

363
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,410
work on it you become part of it because

364
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,730
it's not going anywhere it's not going

365
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:18,350
anywhere no one has control over that

366
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:19,940
and so you either do that or you just

367
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:21,680
kind of get left behind some of the

368
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:24,230
older makeup artists have resorted to

369
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:27,560
like sort of publicly bashing and and

370
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:29,630
shaming or you know bullying certain

371
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,800
even within the middle every to make

372
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,820
parts community like some celebrity

373
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,990
members do it to other celebrity make

374
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,730
parts to think about if they have a lot

375
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:36,080
of followers or if they have you know if

376
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:39,020
they work with certain clients and I

377
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:40,850
just feel like you know for someone who

378
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:42,529
has 20 plus years of experience let's

379
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:45,680
say a makeup artist

380
00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:47,180
to have your legacy be that you were

381
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,279
known for bashing people and for

382
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:50,720
bullying people you know on social media

383
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,550
like that's just horrible for me and I

384
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,740
built a thing it's embarrassing yet and

385
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:57,110
so I just feel like we need to respect

386
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:58,970
each other's feels and each other's jobs

387
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:00,050
or they call it the beauty community but

388
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:02,329
I feel like it needs to be more of a

389
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:06,110
community grade kind of said any better

390
00:12:02,329 --> 00:12:08,990
myself so I'm doing a I call it a snatch

391
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:09,829
I can't leave you've never done this no

392
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:11,749
okay

393
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:12,740
so obviously taping his eyes back and

394
00:12:11,749 --> 00:12:15,170
I'm going to be tying it in the back

395
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:17,420
with a string and what that does is it

396
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:19,009
enables it pushes the eyes back this is

397
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:20,749
a very very old Hollywood trick it's

398
00:12:19,009 --> 00:12:23,089
been done for so long in Hollywood and

399
00:12:20,749 --> 00:12:25,399
movies and filming and red carpets and

400
00:12:23,089 --> 00:12:27,230
stuff I might do this I do this pretty

401
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:29,749
let me not often but I do it quite a bit

402
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:31,069
especially on photo shoots and you could

403
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:33,410
do it on a red carpet - if the hair is

404
00:12:31,069 --> 00:12:34,939
down because it clevers it yeah a lot of

405
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:36,829
celebrities do it you know we just don't

406
00:12:34,939 --> 00:12:38,749
know why planes do it a little Jack

407
00:12:36,829 --> 00:12:41,059
needs of course yeah me for sure though

408
00:12:38,749 --> 00:12:43,129
that dries and then I basically pull

409
00:12:41,059 --> 00:12:45,529
that oh my god you can really even see

410
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:46,579
it yeah you got to do it really clean

411
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:48,170
you know sometimes you could see it a

412
00:12:46,579 --> 00:12:48,529
lot and you can actually cover it with

413
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:49,819
makeup

414
00:12:48,529 --> 00:12:50,930
I mean you will we're gonna see this

415
00:12:49,819 --> 00:12:52,189
though in the video but you know we're

416
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:55,160
doing a fantasy it's like more for the

417
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:57,230
photo I mean so let me see something

418
00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:00,790
like that let me pull it and it just

419
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:00,790
kind of snatches the face in the brows

420
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:11,600
we put one of my double chin a lifetime

421
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:13,069
supply and I was on a video lately when

422
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,420
you do some clients thing I just said

423
00:13:13,069 --> 00:13:16,100
transform to another four day to really

424
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:17,149
feel it you know you mean like yeah it's

425
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,589
like anything I mean it's literally

426
00:13:17,149 --> 00:13:22,009
getting a facelift without any of the

427
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:23,899
surgery at all like just a facelift and

428
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:25,610
they just feel like so snatched and

429
00:13:23,899 --> 00:13:29,509
beautiful hell of my face left at age 19

430
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:30,559
yeah oh all right so now because the

431
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:31,670
reason why I did this on him cuz I

432
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:34,129
wanted that was kind of envisioning like

433
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:34,450
a black line like sort of like I'm never

434
00:13:34,129 --> 00:13:36,550
gonna

435
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:39,330
they learned okay I just felt like the

436
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:41,350
brows need to be lifted on the corners

437
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:44,890
so I'm using a palette for the first

438
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:47,230
time what this so I have one of these he

439
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:48,490
sent it to me but I didn't use it in

440
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:50,320
touch it yet because I think i swatched

441
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:51,730
one color but I'm saving it so there are

442
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,500
certain products that I save for the

443
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:54,880
future because I think in like 20-30

444
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,770
years you'll be super iconic and I wanna

445
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,390
make sure I have them like on touch so

446
00:13:56,770 --> 00:14:00,990
yeah yours is one of them so you get the

447
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:04,960
send me another one guys okay well

448
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:06,910
alright so we'll probably work in these

449
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,410
ranges here it's more natural like I

450
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:10,090
said people don't see me do rainbow

451
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:11,830
rainbow rainbow but nobody has really

452
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:14,080
seen me do like glam with it yet so this

453
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:16,570
perfect well speaking of learning new

454
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:19,720
tips and tracks your masterclass so fun

455
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:21,160
so fresh I went to one she did so I flew

456
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:24,160
all the way to New York for you got a

457
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:25,690
mom I yes I did I was so excited to see

458
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,460
Mario because we had met several times

459
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:28,480
when I had always been good friends but

460
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:30,940
I never think I actually gotten to

461
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,440
seeing you work before so super super

462
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,820
excited but I walked with my little

463
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,650
notepad like ready of my little time to

464
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:37,030
take notes of everything but it was such

465
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:39,280
a cool experience getting to watch you

466
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:40,300
work and seeing you play I'm Kim and all

467
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,220
like the different tips and techniques

468
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,750
that you've been using forever like it

469
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:45,520
was so fun I feel like I learned so much

470
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,780
I think people don't realize it's a lot

471
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,220
more than just technique it's up to

472
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:50,050
because I feel like the majority of

473
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,190
people that are there are aspiring many

474
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:52,180
mores right or there are make smart is a

475
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,740
different level some of them are

476
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:55,300
youtubers it some of them are you know

477
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:56,530
the lot of them do brides and they you

478
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,360
know they're out there and hustling and

479
00:14:56,530 --> 00:15:00,280
doing clients everyday and stuff like

480
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,600
that so they learn like more so than

481
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,850
just techniques they really learn how to

482
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,650
approach like different face shapes and

483
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:07,330
how to think about approaching a face

484
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:09,100
and how to do certain different looks

485
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:10,480
and how to build and how to you know

486
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,620
it's a very very intense people when

487
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,760
people don't realize that I think they

488
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,600
think in the beginning that it's just

489
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,920
kind of like a technique

490
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,930
thing you know but it's literally five

491
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,610
hours on one face so you can imagine the

492
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:20,199
amount of like info that's that's

493
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:22,029
happening it's a lot it's a little

494
00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:23,889
spoiler alert for me it's the most

495
00:15:22,029 --> 00:15:25,569
important part and the most you know the

496
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:26,920
part of my job that I'm like hands-down

497
00:15:25,569 --> 00:15:28,480
the most passionate yeah because I

498
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,550
wanted to be a teacher my entire life

499
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,410
yeah so I've sort of found the way to

500
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:33,699
become a teacher and a make worse at the

501
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:35,170
same time how long have you been doing

502
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:37,269
the classes for I started the master

503
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:39,009
class almost tenured almost ten years

504
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:42,100
earlier in LA so there was a YouTube

505
00:15:39,009 --> 00:15:42,519
video 10 years ago that Kim and I put on

506
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,560
YouTube

507
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:46,000
and you know obviously Kim she around

508
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,009
that time she was really like starting

509
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,420
to become heavily like a beauty icon

510
00:15:48,009 --> 00:15:50,560
people were girls are on the world and

511
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:52,509
really not enough to her they loved

512
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,949
their her glam looks and so after that

513
00:15:52,509 --> 00:15:55,360
video came out I started getting

514
00:15:53,949 --> 00:15:56,889
messages from people around the world

515
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,600
basically just asking me questions and

516
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:59,949
asking me like how can I do this or how

517
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,269
can I advance in this or what I'm like

518
00:15:59,949 --> 00:16:03,130
what are the steps I need to do right

519
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:04,720
you know to become successful and so I

520
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:06,089
was sitting at home one day and I just I

521
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,319
was like wow like all of these people

522
00:16:06,089 --> 00:16:10,000
but unless they started assisting

523
00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:11,529
someone because this is before YouTube

524
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,089
was really a thing unless they start

525
00:16:11,529 --> 00:16:15,279
assisting someone and unless they live

526
00:16:13,089 --> 00:16:16,029
in London Paris New York or LA they'll

527
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,920
never have a chance

528
00:16:16,029 --> 00:16:19,750
yeah and so that's when I decided to do

529
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,680
this class I was like let me teach them

530
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,880
the tricks of the trade in this class

531
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,279
and what I believe to be able to have

532
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:27,399
bands right and so my first class had

533
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:28,779
like 16 students in it yeah I started

534
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:30,970
like really small and now there are

535
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:32,079
thousands yeah and that's how the master

536
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:34,180
first started but it's like literally

537
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:35,889
did you know I'm just so one thing I'm

538
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:38,050
like extremely proud of in my career

539
00:16:35,889 --> 00:16:39,250
alright so I'm gonna just now set using

540
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:41,259
the laura mercier translucent powder I'm

541
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:42,519
just gonna set the concealer I'm just

542
00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:44,050
very lightly I'm not gonna do it too

543
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:46,360

ever done

563
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,839
no I mean there's been thousands yeah

564
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,970
are to say but you know like also a

565
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:28,350
miniature with the you to it's like your

566
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:29,460
work changes over the years and

567
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:31,410
sometimes you can look at your old

568
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:33,120
working like you know yeah it always

569
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:34,590
changes my chemically my favorite look

570
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,970
so he's changed what's your favorite

571
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:38,130
right now like that you felt like

572
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:39,660
recently okay if that's easier

573
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:42,750
I mean there's one that I did on Kim for

574
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:43,920
like her her glam Bible campaign I'd

575
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,720
really lie up with the lake the

576
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,790
lightning-rod going to yeah that was so

577
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,650
pretty I like that one I'm anybody now

578
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:51,720
usually deeper shade to go over that

579
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:53,040
consumer what is this call is ten

580
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,930
percent off you know I'm really

581
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,520
impressed that you can remember it like

582
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:58,620
that means you really like you were

583
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:00,090
really intensely involved because yeah I

584
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:02,340
I mean I have bad memory wouldn't

585
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:05,010
memorize all these names the palate

586
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:06,360
literally like when I approach my morphe

587
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:08,190
so you do the palate I already had it

588
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:10,260
fully designed on Photoshop like with

589
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:11,970
all the same names included as well we

590
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:13,680
sent me that photo something I remember

591
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:16,830
before it launched it was like a picture

592
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:18,510
of I did yes I remember tax to be like

593
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:19,620
what would you add to this I was trying

594
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:21,180
to get a lot of people that I respected

595
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,920
the opinions of like input on the

596
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:24,600
palette before it launched because I

597
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:27,240
really Col that obviously was to make it

598
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:29,130
for working artists and for like all

599
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,450
makeup lovers I remember being at your

600
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:34,230
house of a bunch of wind up in the

601
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:35,790
downtown and I remember trigger and I

602
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:36,210
remember you were working on it back

603
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:38,280
then

604
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:39,570
yeah you know you were kind of was

605
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,370
testing out some of the shadows with you

606
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:43,140
but they were actually really amazing

607
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:45,690
back then too so I'm just gonna probably

608
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:47,940
do kind of do direction it's going right

609
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:49,500
now there's like very blown out smokey I

610
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,460
love cut creases everything to I really

611
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,070
appreciate them and stuff but I just

612
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:54,840
don't for me I personally my aesthetic

613
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:56,490
my response I think is more of a blown

614
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,620
out like a really blown out and blend it

615
00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:00,720
up a look because it's it for me it's

616
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:02,340
more sexy and I love sexy makeup yes and

617
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,630
so probably just gonna wind up doing

618
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:05,310
that I want to ask you the question

619
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:07,080
because after leasing this palette I

620
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,800
haven't asked literally eighteen million

621
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,080
times

622
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:11,260
speaking of creating a palette or would

623
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,660
you ever be interested in doing

624
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:15,790
a marginal effect makeup line yeah I

625
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:17,470
mean that's been my goal for like 17 18

626
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:19,210
years I think it didn't happen the

627
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:20,799
future of you know I don't have any

628
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:22,390
solid dates or anything like that but

629
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:24,250
it's something I've been slowly very

630
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:26,559
slowly working on the past three or four

631
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:28,510
years myself yeah it's a lot of work a

632
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,070
lot of work a lot of money obviously I

633
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:31,840
get offers like a lot of offers from

634
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:33,970
investment firms and huge companies and

635
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,919
investors and corporations and retailers

636
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:36,910
to do lines with them right but I really

637
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,280
want to do it myself

638
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:42,880
without any investment yeah so I could

639
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:44,830
be fully in full control a bit and which

640
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,630
I think of Stowe cuz I would do the same

641
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:47,770
thing yeah so I'm not sure when it's

642
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:49,419
gonna happen I'm really not gonna rush

643
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:51,130
it's gonna start out small you know

644
00:19:49,419 --> 00:19:53,110
slowly kind of grow it from there but I

645
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:54,370
don't care about you know rushing it or

646
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:55,840
you know just coming up to market

647
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:57,370
because Instagram is hot right now you

648
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,350
know I love that yeah I'm just gonna do

649
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:01,990
it when it's right and when when it's

650
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:03,880
ready yeah I I really really love that

651
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:04,870
in that I mean obviously not hard I

652
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,370
respect you but that just makes me

653
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:14,440
respect you so much Warren's doing some

654
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:16,929
cream product here just to tune so it's

655
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,400
to face this is my I think this is my

656
00:20:16,929 --> 00:20:20,740
favorite color image better color really

657
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,620
I love I just love a matte color that

658
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:26,679
has that like yellowish undertone uh-huh

659
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:28,299
no a lot of medium and darker skin tone

660
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:30,040
people have been using it for banana

661
00:20:28,299 --> 00:20:32,110
powder yeah which i think is so cool

662
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:33,520
this would be a great color for a deeper

663
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:37,660
skin tone to kind of put on their eyes

664
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:40,510
yeah like yep alright so this looks all

665
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:42,429
pretty oh my god so this is one layer of

666
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:44,169
liner people always get shocked at the

667
00:20:42,429 --> 00:20:45,880
classes like because I typically would

668
00:20:44,169 --> 00:20:46,890
score it by layers upon their for one

669
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:49,259
look

670
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:52,029
[Music]

671
00:20:49,259 --> 00:20:54,820
so I'm gonna just go ahead now and start

672
00:20:52,029 --> 00:20:56,350
your skin I'm so excited for this but

673
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,879
I'm gonna put more I'll do more liner

674
00:20:56,350 --> 00:21:00,009
and lashes in everything a little later

675
00:20:57,879 --> 00:21:01,600
are you excited let's good because I

676
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:04,779
used to have really bad skin growing up

677
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:06,370
and for me like I love doing eyes but

678
00:21:04,779 --> 00:21:07,659
like I know that I can slay it ah you

679
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:09,639
know what I mean so like skin for me

680
00:21:07,659 --> 00:21:10,899
it's always like a fun challenge because

681
00:21:09,639 --> 00:21:12,789
I always like my skin to look like as

682
00:21:10,899 --> 00:21:14,289
perfect as possible and it's been like

683
00:21:12,789 --> 00:21:15,250
such a learning process for me

684
00:21:14,289 --> 00:21:18,070
throughout me they kept routine because

685
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:19,120
I used to cake on all my palettes but I

686
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:21,190
feel like I've gotten a lot better at

687
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,840
like still using a lot but like making

688
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:25,779
it look a lot prettier in a lot like

689
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:28,000
right better both in real life and on

690
00:21:25,779 --> 00:21:31,240
camera too so it's I always love seeing

691
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,289
how different artists do skin feels like

692
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,450
I feel like that's the one area that I

693
00:21:32,289 --> 00:21:35,440
can always really really learn more

694
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:36,850
about yeah

695
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,429
so that being said should we do the

696
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:42,429
Cutie like the juniors like dark orange

697
00:21:39,429 --> 00:21:44,289
accommodation or sugar do they coming

698
00:21:42,429 --> 00:21:46,450
from like an hour I'm literally NARS

699
00:21:44,289 --> 00:21:48,159
from my spray tan so the good Lankans

700
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:50,200
well I've always had a lot of trouble of

701
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,809
matching my foundation because my like

702
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:56,250
body is pretty yellow tone but my like

703
00:21:52,809 --> 00:21:59,320
neck and chest are like literally like

704
00:21:56,250 --> 00:22:01,389
yeah my god why are you so perhaps use I

705
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:04,480
actually go dark with conditional I

706
00:22:01,389 --> 00:22:09,250
almost get like who cares I've given up

707
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:10,720
I'm give like who cares all right

708
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:12,309
sisters so that is officially every

709
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,559
single foundation that I now own when

710
00:22:12,309 --> 00:22:16,120
it's watched on both my face and my neck

711
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:21,429
and chest sure didn't concealer before

712
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:23,740
foundation yes yes ma'am how long would

713
00:22:21,429 --> 00:22:25,330
you say like your normal paint on

714
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:26,710
somebody else it's always different

715
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:28,539
because it depends on like the situation

716
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:31,149
you're in we write in some lip some

717
00:22:28,539 --> 00:22:33,070
clients want it done fast like 30

718
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:36,190
minutes and some clients give you two or

719
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:37,870
three hours oh so it really depends on

720
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:39,730
the client also dependent under the

721
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:41,559
circumstance I people don't realize like

722
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:43,000
when you're doing a when your celebrity

723
00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:43,879
make words like the type of conditions

724
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,169
you're working under

725
00:22:43,879 --> 00:22:47,419
usually every day there are pretty good

726
00:22:45,169 --> 00:22:48,859
times intense yet like it's never I

727
00:22:47,419 --> 00:22:50,719
never will have someone ever ever ever

728
00:22:48,859 --> 00:22:52,999
like this that's just like quiet no

729
00:22:50,719 --> 00:22:54,829
phone like you know calm yeah always

730
00:22:52,999 --> 00:22:56,659
they're on their phone their head is

731
00:22:54,829 --> 00:22:57,829
down their publicist is early during an

732
00:22:56,659 --> 00:22:58,999
interview they have their kids there

733
00:22:57,829 --> 00:23:00,139
they're getting their toes and their

734
00:22:58,999 --> 00:23:01,969
hands down they're getting their hair

735
00:23:00,139 --> 00:23:04,279
blown yeah I mean a wig puts you know

736
00:23:01,969 --> 00:23:06,079
put in or extensions right so it's

737
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:07,369
really like intense moving and let them

738
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:09,559
moving if you never get to have someone

739
00:23:07,369 --> 00:23:10,969
sitting still and so you know that's

740
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:12,529
just the reality of it and so like

741
00:23:10,969 --> 00:23:14,269
that's just how how the work is

742
00:23:12,529 --> 00:23:16,639
typically every day so just keep that in

743
00:23:14,269 --> 00:23:18,049
mind everyone when you're judging you

744
00:23:16,639 --> 00:23:20,119
know and then they go on the red carpet

745
00:23:18,049 --> 00:23:21,679
of course everyone judges and right you

746
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:22,969
know but it's fine I mean it's pretty

747
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,679
bad you like working under pressure

748
00:23:22,969 --> 00:23:26,419
sometimes I get three hours and

749
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:27,799
sometimes I get 15 minutes it just

750
00:23:26,419 --> 00:23:29,299
depends what is really an ideal

751
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:31,279
situation would it be like calm where

752
00:23:29,299 --> 00:23:33,289
you just get to like say and play yeah I

753
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:35,869
mean I would like I'm a very calm person

754
00:23:33,289 --> 00:23:38,269
so I like I like it when I could just

755
00:23:35,869 --> 00:23:40,429
kind of focus and you know not not be

756
00:23:38,269 --> 00:23:42,619
too rushed let me get that being said

757
00:23:40,429 --> 00:23:44,539
like when I'm rushed I usually do really

758
00:23:42,619 --> 00:23:48,919
good work you know when time came 9 to

759
00:23:44,539 --> 00:23:50,749
10 minutes Oh lightly that it laid in

760
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:52,039
New York this was many years ago we were

761
00:23:50,749 --> 00:23:54,979
at MTV as she was wearing a black

762
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:56,539
television and we had 10 minutes to do

763
00:23:54,979 --> 00:23:59,239
four full hair and makeup and I made it

764
00:23:56,539 --> 00:24:01,369
work lashes everything you know another

765
00:23:59,239 --> 00:24:02,749
time I remember I've had some crazy

766
00:24:01,369 --> 00:24:05,809
experiences another time I remember I

767
00:24:02,749 --> 00:24:08,239
did this was back in here also the

768
00:24:05,809 --> 00:24:09,739
celebrity arrived late to the hotel room

769
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:11,089
and we had to go to an event in

770
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:13,279
Manhattan and we were in Jersey or

771
00:24:11,089 --> 00:24:14,269
hotels in Jersey and so we had that's

772
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,099
mistake number one

773
00:24:14,269 --> 00:24:17,449
whoever booked her hotel there I'm not

774
00:24:16,099 --> 00:24:18,679
sure why she was in Jersey I think she

775
00:24:17,449 --> 00:24:22,699
had another job in Jersey or something

776
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:24,319
ok ok so we had to run into the car you

777
00:24:22,699 --> 00:24:25,669
know this is like a years ago before I

778
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:26,359
had an assistant so like I had to pack

779
00:24:25,669 --> 00:24:28,099
everything myself

780
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:29,659
we had run-ins in the car and she put

781
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:31,099
her head on my lap in the car in the

782
00:24:29,659 --> 00:24:32,749
back seat in the dark it was dark

783
00:24:31,099 --> 00:24:34,249
outside we put that little light up on

784
00:24:32,749 --> 00:24:36,259
the car yeah and I did her entire face

785
00:24:34,249 --> 00:24:39,619
with her laying in the backseat on top

786
00:24:36,259 --> 00:24:41,389
of my oh and actually the futures game

787
00:24:39,619 --> 00:24:43,220
it was like the most fulfilling moments

788
00:24:41,389 --> 00:24:45,909
when that stuff happened

789
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:48,919
you've been weakened for 19 years now

790
00:24:45,909 --> 00:24:50,090
you see the trends come and go what

791
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:51,559
would you say are like your staple

792
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:53,179
makeup trends that you're just like live

793
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:54,620
for and actually don't love makeup

794
00:24:53,179 --> 00:24:56,269
trends I'm not a huge follower of trends

795
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:58,010
but yes for me it's only because the

796
00:24:56,269 --> 00:24:59,269
type of makeup that I have to do every

797
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:00,769
day like I'm not allowed to just do

798
00:24:59,269 --> 00:25:02,269
trends like I have to just do what they

799
00:25:00,769 --> 00:25:03,799
want sort of what looks best on them but

800
00:25:02,269 --> 00:25:05,299
that being said like recently for

801
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:07,730
example there's been a huge trend of

802
00:25:05,299 --> 00:25:09,320
glitter right haha glitter and like bold

803
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:11,450
colors and so I've been doing all that

804
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:13,120
because sort of when people see

805
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:15,049
something on social media everyday

806
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,490
celebrities you know like they it's

807
00:25:15,049 --> 00:25:18,200
almost like they become accustomed to it

808
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:20,090
and so it becomes okay a little bit yeah

809
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,590
which is super dull you know like I'm

810
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:23,240
even finding that the clients are like

811
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:24,769
let's do glitter let's do a pink eye you

812
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:26,510
know this you know things like that so

813
00:25:24,769 --> 00:25:28,460
that being said even though I don't love

814
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:30,799
trends and because I took oligo can't

815
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:32,090
follow them I really appreciate them

816
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,010
it's like one of those questions that

817
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:35,330
editors always ask like oh what trans -

818
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:36,529
hey it's like I don't hate any of them

819
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:38,029
there's all they're all fun and bright

820
00:25:36,529 --> 00:25:39,350
you know it's like makeup it's all fun

821
00:25:38,029 --> 00:25:40,519
well that leads me into a good question

822
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:42,830
that I was actually getting ready to add

823
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:44,269
there's no perfect sisters right I'm

824
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:45,980
gonna say obviously like you've been the

825
00:25:44,269 --> 00:25:48,139
pioneer of so in different makeup trends

826
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:49,639
like how I think I'll try it but have

827
00:25:48,139 --> 00:25:51,110
there been any like techniques or like

828
00:25:49,639 --> 00:25:52,429
tricks that you've learned from other

829
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:53,840
influences are artists that you have

830
00:25:52,429 --> 00:25:55,490
influenced it and now you use all the

831
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,380
time well let me first clear this up

832
00:25:55,490 --> 00:26:00,279
because this is controversial I didn't

833
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:02,330
create or invent highlighting contouring

834
00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:03,500
specifically contouring because they

835
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:05,210
call me the contour King go applause

836
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,769
yeah contouring has been around I mean

837
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:08,389
Mona Lisa its contoured in her vanity

838
00:26:06,769 --> 00:26:10,519
you know it's been around for ages

839
00:26:08,389 --> 00:26:13,100
drag queens always did contouring myself

840
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:14,960
with Kim really popularized it in the

841
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,279
digital mainstream or on the mainstream

842
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,919
yeah you know when I was an assistant

843
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:20,330
for several years I learned so many

844
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:21,980
tricks of the trade from like literally

845
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:23,240
the best networks in the world I knew

846
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,710
like so many of those things at a young

847
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,330
age because I was seeing them every day

848
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:28,010
on set things like contour highlight

849
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:29,630
obviously like just all tech like cut

850
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:31,070
creases like all that stuff I learned or

851
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:32,779
like how to do the tapes and yeah how

852
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:34,340
did remove eyebrows all these kind of

853
00:26:32,779 --> 00:26:36,289
things I learned I learned more so I

854
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:37,669
think from regular women like I'm really

855
00:26:36,289 --> 00:26:39,230
interested in seeing how regular women

856
00:26:37,669 --> 00:26:40,820
do their makeup and I think there's

857
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:42,340
something extremely charming and cute I

858
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:44,200
love seeing regular women's makeup

859
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:45,550
because I kind of like in my mind let's

860
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,200
say you know if I see someone in the

861
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:49,390
restaurant or something I never judge

862
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,500
but like I'll see something look at it

863
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:52,240
and I'll kind of like create something

864
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,260
in my mind from what they did at home

865
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,000
yeah

866
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:56,950
and then as far as like influencers and

867
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,060
stuff like that I just get I gets part

868
00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:01,980
of it you know they do really cool

869
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:01,980
different things you have packing you

870
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:07,450
what is your favorite step off the

871
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:09,910
makeup retained okay I know what Miley's

872
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:12,850
fingers are why some of these favorites

873
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:14,580
are lashes same hundred verse I hate

874
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:16,630
doing lashes obviously despise that

875
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:18,400
especially you know false lashes and the

876
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:20,170
hands are big so it's like just annoying

877
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:23,710
for me to get in there I don't love

878
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:25,210
doing lips either same hey absolutely

879
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:26,110
hating let's do some other people too

880
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:28,150
it's so hard

881
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:29,680
yes especially the dark colors yeah my

882
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:31,360
favorite would be probably it depends on

883
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,920
the face like if someone has amazing

884
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,230
eyes enemy eyes you know if someone has

885
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:40,510
like like incredible skin and I would

886
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:44,680
love doing this I always like a peachy

887
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:50,130
blush gonna dip into face what is it

888
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:50,130
face face a sea

889
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:57,430
so for you so go down the lap so I can

890
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:58,720
shut up yeah I want to know because they

891
00:27:57,430 --> 00:28:00,400
feel like the people who watch me it was

892
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,320
very like split I definitely valid or

893
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:04,420
makeup but I also have a lot of really

894
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:06,280
amazing and talented aspiring makeup

895
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:07,450
artists so as someone who's been in the

896
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:09,670
space for so long it's been a role model

897
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:10,840
to so many of us what would be your

898
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:13,690
biggest piece of advice to aspiring

899
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:14,920
artists well if you want to be you know

900
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:16,150
something if you want to grow in your

901
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,530
career and you want to be successful I

902
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:20,050
think one of the most important things

903
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:21,400
is just sacrifice you're gonna have to

904
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:22,810
sacrifice you're not gonna be able to go

905
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,160
on vacations constantly go out to the

906

clubs and the bars everyday air and

907
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,280
every weekend you know you have to put

908
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:29,830
in the work in order to see the results

909
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:32,200
and so that's number one my sacrifices a

910
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:33,430
tremendous amount yeah and then my mom

911
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,690

to school you know so she's a very

914
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:39,820
simple had a woman

915
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:41,200
what she did teach me always that I

916
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:42,820
followed always is just to be a good

917
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,230
person and I always tell my students

918
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:46,029
that no matter what you do and the

919
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:47,200
decisions that you make and the way you

920
00:28:46,029 --> 00:28:49,000
