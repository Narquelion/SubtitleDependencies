131
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,040
growing up in the social media world

132
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,439
tick tock obviously has become massive

133
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,879
and

136
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,560
that you are like the queen of the tick

137
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,720
tock

141
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,840
talk

142
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,040
i had to make a change i feel like i had

143
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,799
to because one

144
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,439
haley really blew it yodeling haley for

145
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,120
those of you guys who don't know

146
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,120
yodeling haley is the girl who did that

147
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:19,680
the dance is cute as hell say so there

148
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,400
have been 20

149
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,199
million videos made with that sound oh

150
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,639
my god

151
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,639
and each one of those videos also has

152
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:30,400
videos that's insane yeah

153
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,720
the song is a bop it's really changed my

154
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,000
life

155
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,720
as far as like you know i just i'll make

156
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,560
a song

157
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,240
and people even in the youtube comments

158
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,600
will be like oh let's hope tick tock

159
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,520
doesn't ruin this one

160
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,280
so i feel like my whole career has

161
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,960
become based around it

162
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,800
on tech talk yeah like that might be a

163
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,160
possibility but i mean there's no

164
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,199
denying that the app has the power to

165
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,040
make any song

166
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,960
yeah because you can do anything to a

167
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,560
song you can like do your nails and put

168
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,680
the song in the background whatever you

169
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,000
know what i mean but on youtube it's

170
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,520
different

171
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,120
because you have to like get rights and

172
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,919
stuff you can't you can't use any music

173
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,919
yeah you can't use it

174
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,440
just i think it's so stupid i'm tired of

175
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,280
that like royalty free

176
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,520
like what is the music oh how's it go

177
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,680
the awkward sound that little like ding

178
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,800
ding ding ding like when she was like

179
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,199
awkward oh

180
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,600
my god i really do appreciate tick-tock

181
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,639
and i mean even like the dumb tick tocks

182
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,479
i make

183
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,479
double jointed [ __ ] be like

184
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:28,479
girl you need to stop it

185
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,639
just stop at first honestly like i would

186
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,400
watch tick tock cringe compilations

187

but i literally

243
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,199
it's like my favorite stuff with any

244
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,280
makeup routine you got to do a whole hop

245
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,360
skip and a jump and a cartwheel and

246
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,960
all types of stuff to get them when i do

247
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,039
my makeup don't judge me

248
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,639
judge me free i do it on the floor but

249
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:31,120
if you walk into my house

250
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,400
it's like there is just makeup all over

251
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,240
the floor i've seen that whenever you

252
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,440
facetime me yeah i haven't said anything

253
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,840
about it because it's not my place to

254
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,919
judge

255
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,199
i just have like a long mirror that just

256
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,199
leans up against a wall and

257
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,479
i sit on the floor and the makeup gets

258
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,479
spread out so i

259
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,479
end up being like 20 feet away from the

260
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,080
mirror and i have to like sleep all my

261
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,479
makeup into the mirror and then

262
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,000
sit in the pile of makeup you really do

263
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,080
do your makeup often huh

264
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,360
yeah when i don't need to people where

265
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,280
are you going people ask me that i'm

266
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,599
like um instagram screens go what you

267
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,520
mean

268
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,960
i'm going to sleep these are pajama

269
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,879
lashes i've seen you do your makeup

270
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:06,400
before on instagram live huh

271
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:08,080
your instagram lives are something else

272
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,280
before we even get into really that i

273
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,759
feel like one of the reasons why i

274
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,840
really

275
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,960
like just like you in general is

276
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,360
obviously your music is good but like

277
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,680
you have

278
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,879
such a fun personality like if you don't

279
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,160
take anything too seriously like you

280
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,560
always just trying to have a good time

281
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,759
and like

282
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,520
if there's any place where i feel like

283
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,479
that shows i just always think back to

284
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,680
your one instagram live where you

285
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,120
started reading your song lyrics with

286
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,599
chain mail and medieval music in the

287
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,000
background magician with the titties

288
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:32,479
told him pick a copy knowing just when

289
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,399
i'm on

290
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,599
i love doing stuff like that why it's

291
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,120
just like honestly

292
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,719
quarantine will do that to you i don't

293
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,719
know i just felt inspired

294
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,399
so that's yeah that's what came out of

295
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,399
that hmm

296
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,000
okay i feel like we should do brows now

297
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,959
while we let this sit in place for a

298
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,920
brief moment yes

299
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,720
ooh i like to do my own brows usually oh

300
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,800
but she's a

301
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,640
she's an mua now i'd like to see you try

302
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,240
to do the spark brow on me

303
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,000
like that was like a that was like a

304
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,120
threat almost a little bit

305
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,800
excuse me but like i kind of want to see

306
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,760
you do it because i feel like you would

307
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,320
kill that

308
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,519
i would it's my job let me pull up a

309
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,880
reference folder so i can make sure that

310
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:18,399
these are really accurate and up to your

311
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,399
standards because clearly they're high

312
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,959
okay well one other question that i want

313
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,680
to ask you kind of going back to a

314
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,240
little bit what we were talking about

315
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,959
earlier

316
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,160
um your first i feel like was move like

317
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,440
your first like viral

318
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,880
that was the first thing that ever

319
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,160
really popped off yeah i remember that's

320
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,680
why i first heard about you you wrote

321
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,279
that i think in like 12 hours and it was

322
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,760
inspired by a shirt that you're wearing

323
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,839
it was a satire it was a joke yeah like

324
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,160
it was really like i was on live

325
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,160
and everybody was giving me their input

326
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,920
i had just started i just set up

327
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,360
we didn't have anything ready to like we

328
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,040
didn't have any ideas

329
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,040
prior like i was just like what do i do

330
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,800
today and i'm wearing cow print and my

331
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,160
hair literally has little horns

332
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,920
yeah and i'm sitting there and i'm like

333
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,000
i'm not about to write about a boy and i

334
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:59,120
just start singing like [ __ ] i'm a cow

335
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,680
[ __ ] i'm a cow right i

336
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,560
made that song in the middle of my

337
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,959
career really

338
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,680
right i had been making music maybe six

339
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,920
years before

340
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,360
yes for like for six years straight i

341
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,240
was putting stuff out nobody

342
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,440
really got into it and i guess it was

343
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,720
one of those moments because it's

344
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,720
something that i would do

345
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,320
i would make like goofy stuff right it

346
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,760
was one of the moments where i was like

347
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,880
i'm gonna make a video to this and i

348
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,640
didn't have a lot of videos

349
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,560
and i think people really appreciate

350
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,079
videos yeah let me put on this

351
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,079
just don't talk for one second you know

352
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,040
what does talking chris [ __ ] there's

353
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,600

396
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,640
bit of a

397
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,880
spritzes setting spray which i could not

398
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,000
locate just to add some hydration back

399
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,800
into the skin because we had a lot of

400
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,480
powder obviously

401
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,760
okay so i feel like when you do makeup

402
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,040
stuff especially like whether it's on

403
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,560
instagram live or whether it's you

404
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,959
facetiming me at three in the morning

405
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,399
i feel like you always try to do new eye

406
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,160
locks which i really like

407
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,399
yes i want to work with color and it's

408
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,200
really hard i feel like i get scared

409
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,040
because i know that

410
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,040
once i put that shade down it's not

411
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,360
coming off so i get scared of that

412
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,880
that's why i don't color a lot oh and i

413
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,040
use this palette

414
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,160
i use that palette and i use that one

415
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,079

416
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,320

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,600
oh my god what is this color i'm just

418
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,880
going to start by grabbing it

419
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,639
which is the dark brown shade in the top

420
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,000
right hand corner and i'm going to start

421
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,000

475
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,920
you're feeling yourself i always like to

476

edit my videos on a positive note and

477
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,120
we've talked a lot about how you're part

478
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,639
of this new and upcoming rap generation

479
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,120
what will be one piece of advice that

480
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,639
you have

481
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,839
to other girls or other little boys out

482
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,399
there that want to follow in your

483
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,959
footsteps

484
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,320
in terms of music one day don't worry

485
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,720
about being perfect

486
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,079
just do what you like to do yeah do not

487
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,040
spend time trying to impress people

488
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,560
because there's always going to be

489
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,040
somebody out there who's going to hate

490
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,199

494
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,800
