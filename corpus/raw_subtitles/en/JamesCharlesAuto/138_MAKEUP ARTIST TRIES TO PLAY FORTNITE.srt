00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:49,649
a little bit to sister speedy I'm always

18
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:51,629
thinking and I come up with generally

19
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:53,960
some of the craziest ideas ever in the

20
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:56,280
entire world and a few weeks ago I

21
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,230
literally had a dream and I swear to God

22
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,000
I cannot make this up that all of the

23
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:06,299
beauty gurus in the beauty community

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,909

29
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,710
will say I was running from him for the

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,090
majority of the finale of the game he

31
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,920

32
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,299
