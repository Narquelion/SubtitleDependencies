to a guy's house and Twitter and I

63
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:58,240
didn't have like any crush on him at all

64
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,160
so I was really really nervous to be

65
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:02,590
there and really slept in the same bag

66
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:05,290
however I was like uncomfortable so I

67
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:07,270
wanted to sleep in like full Club pants

68
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:09,150
and a sweatshirt and like how like eight

69
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:11,620

73
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:22,630

00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:37,670
threshold you should cry Laura so like I

185
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:39,019
was obviously already friends Lacaze and

186
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,819
hey-zeus and we like we face name all

187
00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:42,649
the time but when I started really

188
00:10:40,819 --> 00:10:44,389
coming to California often for different

189
00:10:42,649 --> 00:10:45,529
shoots or different like bookings I

190
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:46,579
started talking with Laura and her

191
00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:48,290
family because they were nice enough to

192
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:51,259
let me literally live with them and take

193
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:52,550
Laura's brother's room for six months on

194
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:54,829
and off and we just got like really

195
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:56,240
really close I obviously moved from New

196
00:10:54,829 --> 00:10:57,360
York so I don't really have family here

197
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,100
so Laura stylet became

198
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,690
like my family and they were it was just

199
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,130
so kind and so welcoming and they were

200
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:03,480
always there for me and then obviously I

201
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:04,890
met drew to work together almost every

202
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,329
single day and same thing with Alden and

203
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:10,140
Victor Victor nails are obviously cold

204
00:11:06,329 --> 00:11:11,579
or straight man and like it's just cool

205
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:13,410
to like have their support and love to

206
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:14,610
is just like when it comes to security

207
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:15,870
and protection it always just like being

208
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:17,370
there to defend us and stuff especially

209
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:18,839
like being in the industry for three

210
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:20,760
years now like I've got so many amazing

211
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:22,140
people but I've also met so many

212
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,630
horrible people and I've been involved

213
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:26,250
like with so much and like they have

214
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:28,290
just always been by my side through

215
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:29,700
everything no matter what and they get

216
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:31,320
and they're with me and like they just

217
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:38,040
know my true intention so like just know

218
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:39,510
you come for James you come it's just

219
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,920
really cool to have like such an amazing

220
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:42,779
group of people around me at all times

221
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,579
that I can really really rely on like if

222
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:46,410
I had not had these guys like I probably

223
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:47,579
would not be here today like I would not

224
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:58,320
be as emotionally strong I would

225
00:11:47,579 --> 00:12:00,300
definitely like you be a stripper we do

226
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,029
take it personal so whenever we see hate

227
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:04,470
comments we really do they learn to talk

228
00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:13,589
about the hate James may not see it but

229
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:16,649
we reply what can we save like no no

230
00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:18,329
just be a bigger person yeah so he

231
00:12:16,649 --> 00:12:19,980
inspires us to be better people at the

232
00:12:18,329 --> 00:12:22,110
end of the day I think it's you like

233
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:23,100
social media can look so crazy from the

234
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:24,540
outside like when you're not really

235
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,399
involved in it it's kind of hard to like

236
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:28,320
really understand like what's going on

237
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,880
and it's easy to make assumptions or

238
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,829
like generalize things or like say

239
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,029
people are copy or like scandals and

240
00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:34,230
stuff I know influence just always say

241
00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:35,459
like oh you don't you don't really know

242
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,480
what it's like until you're in it but

243
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:38,760
like the reality is like you really

244
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,019
don't you have no idea what it's like

245
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,760
and what goes on behind the scenes and

246
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:44,760
the emotional pressure that goes on and

247
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,779
like for me it's it's hard because like

248
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,010
I can't really talk about it with a lot

249
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:49,230
of people because it could come across

250
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:51,120
as really egotistical as ungrateful when

251
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:52,560
in reality it's like it can be really

252
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,820
hard sometimes so like it's been great

253
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,529
to how these guys around me because they

254
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,850
do get it not only how they see me grow

255
00:12:55,529 --> 00:13:00,390
and experience it but they're also like

256
00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:01,649
they witness it to look at it's not as

257
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:03,060
crazy when you're seeing it happen

258
00:13:01,649 --> 00:13:05,690
firsthand I guess you've seen some crazy

259
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,690
stuff happened

260
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:14,950

getting dropped off the helicopter

266
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:27,350
plummeting down to the staff James would

267
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:32,390
bring with him his phone a solar paneled

268
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:39,860

00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:43,610
[Music]

385
00:21:34,029 --> 00:21:45,769
really actually I think he's always been

386
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:47,539
like super generous and like kind and

387
00:21:45,769 --> 00:21:49,100
wanting everyone around him to girl he

388
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:50,360
doesn't show us there's my camera but he

389
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:53,029
does a lot for us behind the scenes

390
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:55,220
obviously because of him like Laura's

391
00:21:53,029 --> 00:21:56,480
boutique that a lot bigger and I will

392
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:58,190
forever be grateful for him because

393
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,539
he'll be like oh do you guys want Lauren

394
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:25,119
sporty clothes like he tells us friends

395
00:21:59,539 --> 00:22:28,129
sometimes and I like yeah so super like

396
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:29,869
confident and like not giving one fling

397
00:22:28,129 --> 00:22:31,970
what anyone things around him like I say

398
00:22:29,869 --> 00:22:35,090
he literally walks into a household and

399
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:37,429
he's he will take his pants off

400
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:39,619
he goes to sleep gnosis unto you so if

401
00:22:37,429 --> 00:22:41,869
he's ready to out they're gonna

402
00:22:39,619 --> 00:22:44,080
come on he's gonna be stinging the whole

403
00:22:41,869 --> 00:22:44,080
time

404
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:47,459
[Music]

405
00:22:47,580 --> 00:23:01,090
so the same person he like wanted to say

406
00:22:57,999 --> 00:23:02,649
something he would tweet it like Hamas

407
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:06,039
but like now he like takes a step back

408
00:23:02,649 --> 00:23:07,840
it's like I mean there sometimes we're

409
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:10,360
like you gotta have to say something but

410
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:12,820
he's definitely known which ones to

411
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:14,409
fight back in fact he's also telling you

412
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:44,309
as a little brother what not to tweet

413
00:23:14,409 --> 00:23:49,080
yeah oh yeah he's a good anything drops

414
00:23:44,309 --> 00:23:56,590
bourbon convert every street boy yeah

415
00:23:49,080 --> 00:24:14,289
I'm gonna be hard working thank you 19

416
00:23:56,590 --> 00:24:22,600
year old with f9 blending brushes we

417
00:24:14,289 --> 00:24:33,759
were like this is the first ever have

418
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:35,740
like a real pro like Tex 24/7 like

419
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:39,249
FaceTime I don't all the time okay so

420
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:41,049
then basically James and this guy did

421
00:24:39,249 --> 00:24:45,100
wanted to find him all the time pushing

422
00:24:41,049 --> 00:24:46,240
by him out to like oh and then he kept

423
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,980
pushing it back because he had to do

424
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,129
like his like work or whatever which was

425
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:53,299
like a lie basically so James facetimed

426
00:24:51,129 --> 00:24:55,759
one of his friends and

427
00:24:53,299 --> 00:24:57,200
complain to them about how like this

428
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:58,369
relationship wasn't working and blah

429
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,980
blah blah blah and like they're not

430
00:24:58,369 --> 00:25:02,989
coming out here to see him and then

431
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:04,940
basically that person told James that

432
00:25:02,989 --> 00:25:06,409
they had a friend as well which James

433
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:07,580
actually knows this right having good

434
00:25:06,409 --> 00:25:10,159
friends with good friends with this

435
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:11,720
person like talk to them on occasion but

436
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,970
never happened to bring this up to that

437
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:16,009
person that they have also been in a

438
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,970
relationship with this person for two

439
00:25:16,009 --> 00:25:19,309
years

440
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:20,840

441
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:22,700

442
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,769

you were talking him but of course he

446
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:32,629
was actually talking to the other person

447
00:25:28,879 --> 00:25:39,710
for a lot longer so me and my friend our

448
00:25:32,629 --> 00:26:37,340
boy friend just texted him the photo

449
00:25:39,710 --> 00:26:38,659
